,Recommended,207690,32595282,Posted: 20 June,all,Audish,"Amanita Design is one of those developers that I love to death, and in their case it's because all of their games are so unrelentingly joyful. From Samorost's kooky cosmic critters to the pleasant rustbuckets of Machinarium, their games exude pure happiness in the form of upbeat gibberish, uncomplicated puzzles, and positive themes no matter how dark individual moments may get. Botanicula is another notch in this merry belt, one that has no trouble juggling goofy vignettes with existential threats.Once upon a time there was a very nice tree, full of little bugs and sprouts and assorted critters. Some spidery thing showed up and started devouring it all with a sort of creeping darkness, and a small band of the aforementioned critters escape with the tree's last seed. Struggling to stay one step ahead of their monstrous adversary, the critters journey through a colorful arboreal world in search of a new home and a fresh start.What this actually means is you have five little dudes who roam around as a unit, following your clicks from screen to screen and interacting with the many living things of Botanicula's world. As an adventure game there's very little player input, relatively speaking. There's only left click (and on occasion mouse proximity has an effect) and only on specific points of interest like critters and items. You don't move your team directly, but rather click on arrows pointing to different areas.These limitations actually serve to benefit the game, especially as the scope of the gameplay expands. Botanicula's world is strange and alien, and most of the puzzles wouldn't work at all if they required more exact input. Instead, you can just click on little creatures to make them fly or yell or burp, and as long as you do it at the right time or in the right order or at all, you can make progress. The scenes your clicks produce are so funny and heartwarming I doubt anyone will have a problem with relinquishing control for them. And then later in the game you'll get to pick specific critters on your team to do things, collect items to use in puzzles, and work through a few more nifty gimmicks.The story is another strong point building on these basic mechanics, a remarkable feat given that it is told entirely without dialogue. The folks at Amanita have mastered the art of storytelling through action and expression and it does tremendous work here. All of the adorable denizens you meet speak in mumbly Sims-like chatter but get their points across through wild gesticulation and the occasional visual aid. This hands-off approach both heightens the impact of events (good and bad) when they occur, and also keeps the game feeling lighthearted and silly the rest of the time. You're also encouraged to experiment with everything you meet, because interacting with new critters earns you collectible cards that can score you extra scenes at the end of the game.You'll experience the world of Botanicula through a mix of vector art and photoshopped works, a finely-blended style that gives everything just enough weight to seem real, without losing its fanciful, dreamlike energy. The peppy soundtrack follows suit with all sorts of cutely and folksy tunes to keep you engaged. The artistry on display here is rare and unique, and makes the game feel like a real treasure from its simple beginning to its unexpectedly epic conclusion. Botanicula makes another excellent entry in Amanita Design's lineup, and an unforgettable title for any fan of point-and-click adventures.Did you enjoy this review? I certainly hope so, and I certainly hope you'll check out more of them athttps://goldplatedgames.com/or on mycuration page!"

All the communication among the characters consists of emotive noises and gestures, so anyone can understand what's going on, regardless of their native language(s). Unique hand-drawn artwork and a wonderful music score and overall sound design. A game children, parents and grandparents might enjoy, alone or together.I will note that the puzzles sometimes seem arbitrary rather than logical - sometimes getting ahead in the story involves just clicking on everything until something happens, but that didn't detract too much from my enjoyment of the game. Indeed it often lead to discovering whimsical little moments in the game that might otherwise have been missed."

It's not very long, but sometimes that can be a positive - the game doesn't outstay its welcome and the pacing is perfect.You can see in the screenshots that this game has a striking visual style, and personally I think it is beautiful. The creature designs are so wonderful and unique, and despite having a pretty serious phobia of insects I managed to complete the game without freaking out.The sound design is the best I've ever heard in a game, the music is intertwined with the game mechanics and in some puzzles the background music joins in with what's going on. It's hard to describe, but if you have any itnerest in interactive audio design then it's well worth checking this out.This is another game by Amanita Design that incorporates non-verbal story telling and they're really good at it. There isn't a single word spoken or written throughout the game, and yet you're able to follow the story through the visuals.The puzzles were actually quite easy by adventure game standards and I don't think I had to look anything up. There is a bit of backtracking, but not too much I felt.All in all a pretty fantastic game, I would recommend it to anyone."

You do things and click on things, not so much out of logic or purpose or because you know what's going to happen, but out of""you just need to click on everything to see what it does""-- and some comical, weird, random things happen.  Then using a little logic you learn to click on things in the correct order and progress the story along.I wish I liked this.  But I couldn't get past all the""wait, what just happened?  Ok, that just doesn't make sense"".  Which make me think of this game more as ""a doodle"" as opposed to ""art"".  It has no point.  No aim or over-arching design, message, or meaning.  Just very random and disconnected.  Yet, is well drawn and colorful and passes the time.  It's not 'art'.  It's a doodle.Given the ratings...I'm sure it's just me.If you like Machinarium, you'll like this.  It has the same feeling."

(And can solve the first level and a half without much difficulty), so I would recommend it for children, too. It has an ecological message beneath it, there are very clear goodies and baddies, and while it does get a little more complex and tricky for youngsters as it goes on, mine was still entranced by the scenarios and characters, as we played together.Truly delightful. If you like games like Machinarium, Tiny Bang Story, or any point-and-click puzzle-solving games this is charming beyond words and the focus is more on discovery and the characters, rather than it being *too* tricky in the puzzles (it can still be challenging at times, but not frustratingly so).

From those seeds sprang beautiful trees with many creatures that lived inside. But one day strange, dark parasites began consuming the life from the trees without giving anything back. There's nothing really to be done but plant a new tree so life can begin anew!The best I can describe this is a exploration, point and click. It's beautifully drawn, with strange and lively music. The sound effects from the things you click become part of the background music. There's no dialogue, and any directions are communicated through pictures or arrows, including the plot.This is a game where you click around to figure out the next step, moving along through trial and error. The puzzles are generous, giving you infinite lives if you mess up. Not all the puzzles reset but most of them don't need to.My biggest complaint is that the difficulty ascension is a little awkward, going from easy, easy, much harder, ahh, WHOA, and easy-ish again. Levels four and five are the hardest and longest by far, and I had to look at guide to figure out a lot of the smaller details.Basically it went from having one step to take to get an item, to having a more Zelda-like approach with three or four steps. There wasn't much warning that this was going to happen.I'm not sure it's a ""humourous"" game but it made me smile in many places.

Machinarium was a much more somber view of a machine's wasteland, it also used more traditional means of gameply (solve everything to continue, whether through traditiona puzzles or point and click cleverness). Botanicula is a much more vibrant world and takes a different approach to its gameplay. Though there are plenty of puzzles that can be solved without too much headscratching, there are also little secrets and optional creatures to encounter.Botanicula is both a beautiful and strange world. Though some objects and settings are recognizable (such as a tree, seed, insects) everything is so alive and full of wonder. Accompanying the superb artwork of the game, are the sounds of Czech band DVA. The music in this game is full of suitably strange and wild tones. Chimes, bells, vocal gymnastics, strings, and just about anything else finds its way into the soundtrack. The music and sound design are perfect for this game.Amantia Design has put together a menagerie of sights and sounds that is completely unforgettable. Botanicula is a trip well worth taking."

There's so much to explore and it's all a surprise, beautiful, original --> I made so many screenshots!The only bad experience I had with this game (but it can be considered my own fault), is that I've only used one save slot (yes save slots are used); if I'm not mistaken there are 6 slots that could be used for every level (start or whenever). I'd really recommend saving every start of a level in a different slot, because you might want to play a level again due to f.e. game achtievements; I took my time and played in 'relaxed' mode (of course this game is ideal for that), gaining 42/53 achievements. I only used 1 save slot and finally saved the beginning of the end. Now if I want to gain the remaining 11 achievements, I have to start all over again.

(“Yoohoo!” as the five little friends would shout Ü)I must admit, I was slightly sceptical as to how much fun a point and click game could possibly be, but shame on me…  It brought me straight back to that childlike wonder you have when you come across something never discovered before; thinking hmmm, what might happen if I just…?It is a think-outside-the-box puzzle game, where you have to trust your intuition and just try… anything goes, whether it’s in a little mini-game or a mini-quest, or one of the many, many puzzles; from the playfully simple ones, to the downright trying ones and finally the ones that are just extremely frustrating (yeah, talking about you caterpillar…)!There is no tutorial, no instructions… you’re simply thrown in the deep end; so go explore, experiment and figure it out yourself… oh, and have tons of fun while you’re at it Ü!!!Botanicula is imaginative and intuitive and to me it has been an absolutely delightful adventure! My only regret is that the journey through this magical world is way too short (the reason that I used such a long time is that I got completely, utterly, totally lost on several occasions throughout the game in the more maze-like levels; turns out I have no sense of direction in games either…) and also I suspect that much of its charm would be lost in a replay…It may not be for everyone, but I loved every bit of it!Ü"

The challenges are interesting, the characters are very charismatic, the story is fun and engaging!

This is one of those games whose charm lies in its simplicity and even a certain naivety, combined with excellent art-style.Storyline is fully revealed in the first minute of the game. Our brave heroes must save last tree seed from voracious spider-like parasites and... that is it. Well, on the way from the top of tree to its roots, heroes will visit quite strange, unexpected and unpredictable places. Here I must say that sometimes Botanicula seemed for me, well... too eclectic. The first part of the game has a beautiful and clearly defined style, but in the middle of the game appeared... inappropriate elements; for my taste, they just do not fit in original style.Last part of the game is excellent, it offers an impressive contrast with the beginning. Live intertwining branches, filled with sunlight and scurrying creatures, are replaced by dark and eerie domain of parasites. The tree is dying. I was deeply impressed by last scene... and inspired by hope. The idea is simple and clear: despite everything, do not despair.As for the gameplay. It is very simple, puzzles are not difficult but well designed and interesting enough. There is almost no inventory management and, in my opinion, it is good, because I do not think that collecting weird stuff and guessing how all this junk should be used, is a necessary element of good game. There are some arcade mini-games, they are well designed and fits perfectly in the mood of the game.World of Botanicula is inhabited by a variety of strange creatures and I humbly advise you to not hurry. Explore the game, click everywhere and see what happens then. In many cases, your curiosity will be rewarded with short funny scene. Botanicula is filled with humor, this game is truly created with love.I really liked the soundtrack, this strange and charming melodies, filled with buzzing and other strange sounds, it creates a very special atmosphere.

If you are the type that appreciates presentation and art over gameplay,  Botanicula is your type of game.  The story is something about some tree dying somewhere and evil spiders have taken over or something, but story isn't too important here.  You control a group of five characters that travel together trying to save the world and during your adventure you'll run into puzzles and tasks that require completion to progress through the game.  However this is the game's best moments, in clicking environmental objects and backgrounds to see what animations will play and how the characters respond.  Your interactions are mostly with fictional bug creatures and plantlife, which really helps to develop what kind of world Botanicula is set it.  It is charming and fun at first, but halfway through the game I had to look up a walkthrough multiple times to see what to do.  It becomes a case of not what your logical thinking is, but what the devolopers had in mind when designing it, and that can stop your progress to a halt.  The puzzles, while usually frustrating, were never so hard to the point of ragequitting.  Throughout the game you will collect cards that can be viewed at any time for amusing animations and sounds based on the creatures and environments you play through.  Supposedly there is a secret ending or reward for collecting all of them, but I didn't stress myself to the point of that and don't feel motivated to play again.  Overall I do recommned Botanicula to fans of point-and-click games and to the more casual crowd of gamers.  However I don't think Botanicula is worth the full price of $10 as it isn't very long and it does have frustrating moments.  Pick it up when it's on sale or in a bundle."

Probably because it's an indie game and they couldn't afford voice actors, but I prefer it this way to begin with!On the downside the ending feels very rushed and in several areas of the game mechanics are introduced once, used once to retrieve a necessary object, and then forgotten about. The ending gameplay areas feel very rushed and a little sloppy.

,Recommended,207690,20722373,"Posted: 24 January, 2016",all,SightBlind,"This game is without question weird. And that’s definitely to its favor.Botaniculais a point-and-click adventure game about the faunal flora residents of a fantastical tree trying to stop a dark, arachnid-like entity from destroying everything they know. If it sounds strange already, then trust me when I say you don’t know the half of it.To begin, gameplay is standard to the genre; as the player, your job is to explore the grand extent of the tree from the dramatically miniscule perspective of your band of five oddball characters. In your adventuring, you are provided the opportunity to interact with nearly every aspect of your environment, collecting items, receiving and completing small quests and challenges, solving puzzles, and unraveling the simple and yet still fascinating narrative before you, often making use of the individual assets of your tiny arboreal team to do so, and all without the game ever uttering more than a few words of human speech in the process.Using that as a steppingstone, I transition into aesthetics. The artwork is absolutely beautiful, reminiscent of the animated fair of Tim Burton. Yet, even as there is a bizarre and almost twisted nature to the visuals, the presentation remains almost perpetually lighthearted (most of the time). Nearly every aspect of the tree that the small band of main characters inhabits has a life of its own and each is immensely unique from one to the next (so much so, there’s even a card-collecting mechanic within the game that showcases a solid plethora of these many faces whenever the player takes interest in looking back). Meanwhile, the main team itself is an odd collective of friends who, while not given heavy character development, are filled with heart and personality. Matching up with the strange visuals and dreamlike presentation is an almost unearthly soundtrack from Czech musical group DVA, who also aided in other aspects of the final product.As I stated earlier, there is almost no true verbal dialogue outside of the intentionally indecipherable mumbles of its characters, and next to no text of any kind; the entirety of the story is recalled and played out on screen as if on a stage. Nevertheless, it is an engaging narrative, even as it is a simple one. In the end, the game isn’t especially lengthy, nor is it predominantly difficult (I, considering myself a less impressive gamer, was able to complete it in right around 5 hours); additionally, like most games in its subset genre, it tends to be a casual experience without an exceptional abundance of high-velocity or high-intensity moments during play. Do any of these facts diminish the value of this game? My answer is an emphatic no. When approaching almost any artistic product—be it a game, a song, a movie, or anything else—it’s important to remember that rarely, if ever, will a piece of art appeal to everyone; even the most popular or widely received products will have people who simply don’t enjoy it the way others do, and this one is certainly not exempt by any means.Botaniculais definitely a strange piece of work. It’s a wild adventure that takes place almost entirely in a tree; it’s a bizarre introduction to a lovable cast and a beautiful world; it’s a story without many words, yet it is filled with all sorts of heart and humor(sometimes irreverent—discerning gamers/parents, feel free to message me for more details); it’s a relatively calm, somewhat brief, light-hearted game that had me entranced, entertained, and engaged all the way through.To sum it up shortly: it was pretty weird, and it was pretty awesome."

Everything you experience here has a charming, hand-crafted feel to it, from the characters to the backgrounds - even the soundtrack is a lovely, quirky mix of accapella in a sound reminiscent of the band Sigur Ros.For some people, point & click gameplay may not be the most exciting, but then again, most people who will enjoy this have played a few point & click adventures, so the gameplay isn't too surprising. Aside from a  few clickable areas that seem to keep you guessing a little bit too long, It's fairly easy to navigate. If you manage to make it through the game in one playthrough, you will definitely be staring back at the screen in awe. It's no Final Fantasy VII, but the sense of accomplishment after struggle is certainly there.If you enjoy indie games, games with a hand-made touch, or games that are great at visual storytelling, then pick this up - you'll be glad you did, like I did :)"

Everything about it takes me back to simpler times when I was so easily entertained. If you have any appreciation for a light-hearted point-and-click adventure, then you will greatly enjoy Botanicula.The gameplay is entirely point-and-click. You will have to solve puzzles and complete fetch quests to progress through the story. Botanicula does a wonderful job of staying fresh through its visual and sound design--i never got tired of doing practically the same thing repeatedly. It also helps that Botanicula will probably only last you a few hours at most. It could have gotten tedious had it lasted much longer. The puzzles are never too difficult either. I had to look up solutions to a couple of parts but ended up kicking myself for not having the patience of figuring it out. The story is light, and is driven by the characters' actions. There is no dialogue whatsoever, rather any information regarding the story is told through pictures and short cutscenes. It's a cute element that suits the game.One of Botanicula's greatest strengths is its visual design. The color palette really pops off the screen, and it adds to the effect when purposeful colorless segments come into play. The bright and joyful colors are complimented by jovial little characters that you control. Each of the characters in your group eventually play a significant role in puzzles throughout the game. While one of them is much more important than the others when it comes to the story, each character has a part to play. Besides the protagonists you control you'll come across several other botanical creatures you can interact with. Playing their little games or simply interacting with them earns you a card with said creature on it that you can collect. If you find them all you get a little bonus after the credits role! All these tiny creatures are diverse in design and range from adorable to mildly frightening. I had fun finding the rascals and discovering their quirks.The overall sound design goes hand in hand with the cute aesthetics. I found myself laughing out loud as I heard the silly sounds some of the creatures made. From speech to the sound of movement, everything was spot on to me. Even the darker, scary enemies were well done and felt intimidating in a game where I knew very well that I couldn't be harmed. The music isn't particularly memorable, but I never thought it was bad at any points either. I suppose it just gets the job done.I loved Botanicula. It's fun, adorable, heartwarming and if I ever have kids someday, I would love to play this with them. This is definitely worth your time."

In fact, the whole game makes you think outside of the normal challenges you find in most adventure games. They are clever and all very ""let's try this and see what happens""  (e.g. if you touch this, what happens and how will that reaction help you).  The game sparked an intuitive exploration mode in me that I didn't know I had and I enjoyed every moment of wandering in its world and not just racing through it to find an ending.A bonus for me is that this is not a violent game other than trying to do away with a bad spider.  This may sound like a lame plot to most hardcore game players who are used to destroying enemies, dominating warloads, and relying on magic and combat to find a just end for the hero.  It isn't.  The fact that the game can be totally interesting and thoughtful without those trappings makes the game magical.I hope the developers create more games like this.  Kudos!

With no dialogue other than sounds and grunts, the game manages to portray a story of despair & hope, longing & belonging and wonder at the vastness of everything.The visuals are just sumptious. The soundtrack is perfectly suited and individualized, like a theme song for each character or unique moment.

,Recommended,207690,29098375,Posted: 7 January,all,Mighty Pillow,"Botanicula is an average point and click game that just barely makes up for it in a cute world of plants and creatures.Pros:- The game takes place in a lovely environment full of plants and life. The colors are nice too.- You control a group of people? Objects? I don't know have to describe them. You control a group of nature heroes, and its funny to see them react to the environment.- I don't normally like when games have no spoken words, but in this case I think it worked. Nothing in this game talks, and its charming.- I enjoyed the music. There is just one part in the game where you control the instruments being played by two creatures, and its entertaining to hear the music develop.Cons:- The controls (can I even call them controls, all you do is click on things) were very unclear. It was at times difficult to figure out how and when to click on something, even when I knew exactly what to do in that situation. That was annoying especially toward the end. There is a section where you have to get a light orb from a pod, and you have to click on the white arrows in a VERY specific way to get the orb. I knew exactly what I had to do, but I had to resort to a youtube video to figure out how to pass this part.- There is no way I found to make the game full screen, so I was playing with a black frame around the game. It was distracting.- Steam overlay wouldn't work while I played, so I was unable to see achievements when they popped up. I also had to alt tab to get to a browser.- When I completed the game, the main menu only gave me an option to play a new game, so I guess there is no way to go to specific chapters in the game. I hate when games do this.Botanicula is very bizarre and trippy which was nice to see. The story was very basic and was satisfying in the end. I can't say I'd recommend this game at regular price. Definitely pick this one up on a sale.There are no jump scares, but there are dark sections toward the end with cartoony-creepy creatures. I wouldn't describe it as scary either."

The little bit extra the game gives you for collecting all the animal cards is worth the challenge also. My only gripes with the game is that the animal cards don't have their names on them or story. Other than that 8/10..."

It's a warm and welcoming game that lets its puzzles grow organically, developing them as it builds its brightly coloured world.But it's not just that over arching atmosphere it gets right, it's the little touches as well.From the glee-filled sound effects when you successfully complete a task, to the grumpy grumble of an inadvertently tapped bug, the game is awash with charm.And on top of that charm there's an overt feeling of wonder in each screen. A child-like glee that pulses through the scuttling footfalls of the five main characters, and finds a hold in every corner of the experience.and some of the puzzles might require a bit too much prodding around at the scenery in hope, but Botanicula is such an enjoyable place to visit that it's unlikely you're going to mind.There's a living, breathing world to explore here, full of mysteries and secrets that are a joy to discover.There aren't many developers brave enough to tell a story without words, but Amanita Design pulls it off magnificently in Botanicula."

I'm pretty sure they did more shrooms this time around because this is by far their strangest game.  You play a group of little plant-inspired characters whose goal is to rid their home tree of and entity that is corrupting it.As a point-and-click adventure game, the gameplay mostly consists of solving short (occasionally long) puzzles which will grant you items needed to continue or reveal various hideous and deformed creatures.  There is no voice acting so the story is told purely through imagery, which actually works quite well.The game has fantastic artwork and good music.  It's fairly short but it depends on how easily you can decifer the puzzles.  Definitely a fun game if you like the point-and-click genre."

And like Machinarium, Botanicula takes place in an odd but very original feeling world. You play a group of little seeds and plant creatures who live in a tree under attack from some black spider creatures that are killing everything in the tree. Your group is trying to escape the tree with a seed from the tree itself. The game plays very similar to Machinarium where you move between various screens interacting with all the weird and unusual inhabitants of the tree ,trying to solve puzzles that allow you to advance.The Good:-This game has a lot of charm in the odd inabitants and the strange world they inhabit. Even better is how the game tells it's story without any character uttering a single world.- The visual style is unique and beautiful in a strange way and really adds to the feel of the game.-The puzzles are fun and at times challenging.The Bad:- The solutions to some of the puzzles aren't very intuitive and i found myself just clicking on everything to see what worked which takes away from the experience of trying to solve the puzzles.-It's a short game which wasn't a major issue for me but might be for some people.Overall this is a pretty enjoyable game and is worth checking out if you think an unusual point and click adventure might interest you.

I gave up after about half an hour."

You do nothing except walk around and click everything in the world. I read a review from someone saying that the sound design was good, surely that reviewer must jest? The constant giggeling and mumbeling gets old really fast. The character ""voices"" sound like they've all been recorded by the same dude in french and then muffled with some sound program. This game is extremely bad, in fact, it is quite a stretch to even call it a game. If you have extremely young children, maybe not even born yet, consider buying it for them.

Everything has been designed so beautifully (in ways words cannot describe). Its visually stunning, the characters are funny, memorable and loveable and the soundtrack is amazing. The levels/ environments are fluid, organic and interesting (you'll be clicking on everything). You are rewarded with animated collectable character & creature cards for exploring the world and interacting with stuff... and you won't get bored of seeing the same things over and over, as the surroundings change at nearly every screen. The diversity is truly astounding. The pace of the game is good too, meaning you are not stuck at the same screen trying to solve a puzzle for ages, but not moving so quick as to miss the hidden gems and soak in the scenery.To contrast the beautiful lively 'spring-like' levels, there are also darker and more isolated spaces, which relate to the story. The story is simple yet brilliant, and it is told in an interesting way without even uttering a word. It's one of those games that's fairly challenging at times but without being too frustrating. The puzzles are enjoyable and make me laugh, rather than them feeling like a chore to complete. It certainly makes me smile... and at many points its just so beautiful and amazing, it might just make you all teary eyed with sheer joy.  :)I honestly can't find anything wrong with this game... it really is a wonderful experience. Would highly reccomend. The game is by Amanita design, and I bought it in the Amanita Bundle with Samorost 2 and Machinarium, two other masterpieces to play through.   :)- 10/10 -"

Each has unique abilities that are used sometimes to solve puzzles, although this mostly comes into play in the beginning of the game. The level and art design are superb and pretty much every puzzle I solved was a delight. There were a few moments where the puzzle design was tedious, but that happens with pretty much every adventure-type game like this. For the most part, the items you get have obvious uses and you don't have a giant inventory of items that you have to try in different combinations to find the solution. Most of the puzzle solving is based on clicking on the environment and moving your mouse to affect it. Your mouse movements affect the environement in this game (making the flowers move in the breeze, etc.) and this mechanic is often used for puzzle solving. I highly recommend this game!"

Great music and the atmosphere and non-verbal story-telling is really cool, similar to Machinarium (same devs) as far as characters speaking through picture speech bubbles. I like the contrast of the very vibrant, colorful, livid, lively, green environment and some parts where it's dying and a part close to the end when things get a bit dark, but no very heavy.*Would probably be great for children*Can run on very low-end computersCons*There are only a couple things that were really puzzles. Mostly I was just clicking a bunch of stuff watching all kinds of weird (yet entertaining) things happen before it gave me whatever item I needed to proceed at the time.*It's very abstract (which I like) and not really as much of a little world that Machinarium was, having really randomness to the different places and organisms you meet. Which I think Machinarium is a better game overall, telling a more cohesive narrative versus this game's sort of child drawing story (that could be taken as a negative or a positive).*The game was really short. I have 2.7 hours on this game and that was with clicking on everything I could find, though I didn't quite 100% it but I wasn't far off. I had little to no problem with the ""puzzles"" so I went through it pretty fast but even someone getting stuck a lot, if that's even possible, would still beat it fairly quickly. I think $10 is a bit pricey for a game that has little replay value and is so short.In summary, this was an enjoyable experience especially at first glance at how wildly out there it was. It's a very sort kid's dream and occasionally nightmare with how abstract it is. But it was very short. I liked Machinarium more."

And some kind of spider parasite thing wanted to kill you and drain all the life from your body. Like any normal parasite would, trying to feed it's hunger, acorn thing has it's friends and all of them have their own talents. Think of it as a giant puzzle game that you're not sure what it looks like. Never seen it before and just can't get enough of it since you want to find out the whole pictue of it. For 10 bucks is a pretty good price. Had this for a while never played it before today and wished I played it a lot sooner.

It is a very cute point-and-click adventure with no possibility of death.  You play as five little plant-like characters exploring a large tree.  I had a three-year-old boy playtest this, and he loved counting the things he found and the pretty pictures.  I have to admit that a few (very few) of the puzzles have stumped me, so he couldn't play it all by himself, and he is fairly smart for a three-year-old.  He made very clear to me that he did not care much for the villainous spiders in the game, but I think that was the point.  For children ages 5-10, I think this is a real treat.

,Recommended,207690,20268081,"Posted: 3 January, 2016",all,Kymars,"I just took the weekend for 2 of Amanita's games: Machinarium and Botanicula.If you've ever played Machinarium before (and you liked it), I'm telling you now that Botanicula is just as amazing. Get it, play it, enjoy it! The graphics are lighter and more colourful in general, the puzzles are only a little less challenging (so no need for a ""cheating"" notebook on the upper right corner, but you still need to crack your head every once in a while), and the story is just as adorable.If you haven't played any of this studio's games, however, allow me to summarise without spoiling you: Botanicula tells the story of a group of plant-y friends who embark on a journey to save the tree of light from darkness (embodied by spiders). Since it's a puzzle game, you need to complete several tasks to get items and continue to the next level. You will find a total of 123 creatures, each representing a creature card that will be given to you, and which you can look at by selecting the deck on the upper left corner. Take your time, though! There are plenty of Easter eggs along the way (golden cards, and also your Steam achievements) that don't all need to be found for you to go through to the end.100% recommend if you're into logic and thinking while having fun.I personally loved it."

Another stunning work from Amanita, even topping their previous effort, Machinarium. Puzzles have a great difficulty curve, the art and music are beautiful, and the narrative is simple and emotionally compelling.

Botanicula, story and gameplay wise does not hold much complexity. It is your simplistic adventure game full of mini-games and lots of memorable, mind-engaging surreal enviroments with a battle between (classic) dark creatures versus the peaceful citizens of nature..

I love that it was constantly surprising me as a player, in playful & quirky way. I loved how the landscape & characters were almost abstract. The game is simple, with few explanations, so you can invent your own backstory. It almost has paved a new way for puzzle solving 'langauge' in terms of the use of physics & sound in order to solve it. Puzzle games are my favourite and this stumped me quite a lot, as I was thinking about how it would be solved in other adventure games.

This game kept a smile on my face throughout playing it, even getting a chuckle out of me at some points. The story is wordless and simple. That is appropriate, since a complex story would take away from the charm of the world. The sound effects given to each character combined with fun animation gives the creatures of Bontanicula their own voices and tiny story to tell. The creatures are fun to discover and click on, which the game encourages with a card collecting achievment system. As the game went on, I started to care less about the achievements and more about what cute animation would pop up when I clicked a leaf.The puzzles are all based on these magical creatures, appropriatly starting simpler in the beginning and gradually progressing into more difficult tasks. With the fantastical nature of the game, some of the solutions are not always obvious, and took some clicking around the screen to figure out. I had to pull out a walkthrough during one point of the game, but that was after attempting the task multiple times. With a little thinking and lots of clicking, I was able to solve the rest of the puzzles.If anyone is looking for a short puzzle game full of charming characters and creatures then Botanicula is a must have. While it's about a 3-4 hour play time, the $10 price tag is deserving due to the obvious time spent fleshing out the world and the creatures. There is a great ammount of polish and love put into this game. Please give it a shot!"

That should give you and general idea of whether you will like it or not.Puzzles are mostly the right kind of challenging, the soundtrack and especially sound effects are incredible, and the quirky story kept me engaged.Well worth a look even at full price but especially on sale."

,Recommended,207690,30364056,Posted: 6 March,all,NyappiCat,"Absolutely amazing game. I love the unique music and how its utilized in the different puzzles. As with Samorost 3 I think it's nice to see a point and click game that isn't just about collecting 15+ items and combining them, but rather about actually interacting with the different environments. I do think it's a shame that once you've finished a level you cannot backtrack and get the last couple of achievements, but the overall game design, plot and feel definitely make up for it. It's really nice how you unknowingly build a relationship with the members of the little gangand how you feel rather determined to defeat the black spider monster once they've been captured. Great game!"

,Recommended,207690,31331735,Posted: 23 April,all,Vortiene,"If you don't really play point and click games and want to try a couple, have this one at the top of the list.Although it's short, it has a ridiculous amount of style. Imaginative critters that are crosses between insects and plants essentially, but they're really hard to describe other than that, you just have to see them in action. You go through the game interacting with these critters, you play as a small team of 5 critters trying to save the ""critter tree"" from being drained of all life by black ""Zlo"" critters. Interacting with the area will introduce you to new critters who will help you progress. It's fun to see how creative the game designers got with the critters, all having their own signature sound effects that are sometimes quite humorous. The sound design is great in this respect, having hundreds of sounds between critters and many tunes that sound like the critters singing a ditty as a group. The area design is also quite varied, going from the canopy of the critter tree to a critter village to a branching cave of more gangled critters.The game is short, but enjoyable all the way through. Puzzles aren't too obscure or confusing, it doesn't really have a hint system but it isn't too hard to figure out what to do. Very satisfying. This game has become one of my favorite point-and-click games, due to its style, music, and sound effects.The game runs at sub 1080p resolution. I think the max width is 1440px, the rest will have a black background. This doesn't affect things too much, but thought I should point it out. It also does not have steam UI integration, so you have to take screenshots manually, for example."

It doesn't take long to complete but it has some funny quirks like that room with the penguins or shooting a little guy from a canon. I didn't find the collecting of items for the different levels tedious but was rather intrigued by some of the silly places they were hidden in. Well done :)"

,Recommended,207690,34745136,Posted: 4 September,all,Lord Darksbane,"So I started this game, put it away, and finished it five years later.  What does that say about the game and what does that say about me? I don't know but it seems like an important point. Its a fun and qwirky little game though it has trouble keeping your attention.  There is the loose impression of a story, but it doesn't really seem important other than a means to drive the puzzles. The puzzles themselves are abstract and a tad scattalogical, but cute.  I had fun, though I wouldn't be beating down the door for a sequel."
