,Not Recommended,207730,7988901,"Posted: 9 December, 2013",all,Whiskey,"I saw this on sale for 99 cents and when a game is that cheap, unless the offends your ancestors in some deep and unforgivable way, you buy it. I, like many others on steam, bought this simply because it's this cheap. The 90% off sale is the ""we're not making any more money from this"" sale last ditch attempt to produce some revenue from a title.  Considering I haven't heard of this rather generic looking, what appears to be some sort of RTS game, I wasn't expecting much and I wasn't surprised in so many ways.Arena Wars 2 is a top down real-time strategy game that pits you against a player or an AI component in what is essentially a match of capture the flag. This is a ""first-impression"" review as I am honestly unwilling to put more than the hour and 20 minutes I put into this game. The gameplay is very mediocre and the units in the game are fairly uninspired. The game seems to be a ""rock paper scissors"" game in the sense that one unit is clearly designed to defeat another particular unit. Unfortunately this concept I felt was implented poorly as one unit will do more damage to another unit seemingly abritrarily and it lacks the thougthfulness of a mature RTS game.There is no tutorial or any intro missions to introduce each of the mechanics so the player is thrown in to engage in a trail and error process of figuring everything out.To this game's merit, I do like the idea. This game is designed to get he player in the action right away and matches will end quickly whereas a full RTS game might include 2 hours of base-building prior to any combat. A match or two of this game could be played on a lunch break.This game is an online game but seeing how this game doesn't have a consistent playerbase this is effectively a single player game. There are several difficulty levels and in my first hour and 20 minutes it took getting to the hardest difficulty level to experience any sort of challenge. One very annoying aspect is that these difficulty levels need to be unlocked *per level* and there are five of them. This means that for each level I want to play on, I need to suffer through four matches of boring before I get to the very average gameplay.I noticed a bug where an area-of-effect ability hits the wreck of a tower it will register damage and repeat ""Turret destroyed"" - there may be more bugs but finding this so readily underlines this game's overall lack of polish.The idea has some merit but I cannot recommend this title for any price. The real cost of a game your own freetime anyway.Score 4/10"

Many people are bashing this game for the lack of depth and while the game certainly does lack depth, it can teach a deep appreciation for rts games with it's handful of interesting mechanics to even someone like me who has never touched many rts. If a single dollar can teach me the basics of an rts and build appreciation for more polished games like Starcraft and Red Alert, I'd say that's a dollar damn well spent."

Scoring system is terrible. Units are awkward to control and you can't have too many out at once. Maps are small and encourage placing units at item spawns to win the game that way. Unit abilities only work 50% of the time. Calling precision air strikes at the start of the match is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game mechanic. Payed 49 cents for the game. Normally i dont care for such a low cost but i kind of want my money back at this point.
,Not Recommended,207730,8987650,"Posted: 5 February, 2014",all,Jack,"5/10 ""Mediocre""Arena Wars 2 is a bare-bone strategy game, and can obviously be seen at first glance. The game offers little strategic involvement as spamming units over and over is an easy task in this game. Games only last about ten minutes and can be quite boring at times. Graphical wise, the game isn't that pleasing the eyes, but does have good explosion effects I will give it that. Overall it shouldn't be purchased at full price, I got it for .99 cents and gotr my moneys worth out of it, but make sure you have a friend with it if you do buy it! BECAUSE NO ONE PLAYS IT."

Arena Wars 2 fits nicely into this category. Fast paced RTS that puts you straight into the action, no mineral collecting to slow the game down. It really is a joy to play a game that hasn't been done what can seem like hundreds of times."

(Yikes I know you have invested so much time learning the current ones).On the plus side after playing with the settings I was able to try this game I grabbed in a sale some time ago for 99c.What I liked:* Control over the entire battlefield* Ability to mix and match units when you need to.* Upgrading to your unit strategy. Though the towers lend themselves to only a few winning strats.What I was not so keen on:* Farming power ups and XP on the sides took away some of the promise of ""Fast Paced"" promise.* Generator concusion blast is too strong. Something that does less damage would be fine, or at least draw out the concussion line around the base so defenses can be set accordingly.* Unit roles are not diverse enough to stop what would inevitably be a battle of attrition. (Whoever upgrades the Destroyers first will take out the turrets and eventually win)* No creeps do make the game seem ""Quiet"" now and then unless you are taking the action to the other player."

Instead of a hero you make a small squad of robots, try to maneuver them around kill neutrals level up and try to opportunistically mess with your rival. There seems to be a capture the flag element with barrels or I assume you could just level the enemy base. Either way its not a compelling experience in today's market.

If they marketed it that way it would be better.  I love the capture the flag element to the game.  Hate flag auto returns though even in FPS CTF I hated auto returns.  Game could be so much better and sell more if they put more work into making it more strategic, allowing more units on the field (units cost much less).  Then you'd have a really good game because the CTF aspect is really great.  The different power ups are nice but they rarely help a lot.  Would be nice to see more power ups and ways to get them.

It looked kinda like a fun version of Tower Defence on the iPad but no sir! This review comprises of all the game shoes shows me before a CTD (Crash TO Desktop). It shows me a loading screen.

The mouse is off centered by at lest four of the little 'tabs' that allow you to go between option like 'Start game', which I, fortunatley, NEVER GOT TO PRESS! It didn't even let me play!

The game has a very steep learning curve, that throws you into the game and just says ""Go on, you can play now"". With no tutorial to introduce you to the games elements it's like walking blind. It took me a good solid thirty minutes to figure out how to, upgrade a unit. There are many things wrong with this game, but look on the bright side, it's graphics are good.
