,Recommended,207930,9564775,"Posted: 19 March, 2014",all,Captain MooMoos,"This is a long review, so if you just want a small scope of information I would recommend skipping to theResultsection and reading from there.Southend Interactive develops Sacred Citadel, a rather riveting game that can best be described as a side scroller beat’em up action adventure. This essentially falls in the same category as Castle Crashers; although, Sacred Citadel loses on the comedy it picks up on the graphics.The Game:Sacred Citadel is about the far away land of Ancaria, which is under attack by the evil Ashen Empire. You play a random soldier (Warrior, Ranger, Mage, or Shaman) with each class uses different techniques in order to defeat the many enemies ahead. Mama Grimmoc, the evil orc mother, is attacking the civilizations which you have become accustomed to. As such you decide to take up your weapon to stop her. You eventually realize Mama Grimmoc is working for a mysterious man, The Merchant, who requires her to retrieve him two artifacts. Upon realizing their value you decide to take it upon yourself to obtain one of the artifacts in order to gain the huge reward The Merchant has promised you for them. The campaign involves fighting off hordes of orcs, bandits, soldiers, monsters and more. As your adventure goes on you must fight your way through four acts totaling twenty levels. Each act contains four levels and a boss fight. You must fight your way through each boss in order to progress to the next act each of the bosses require you to use different strategies. The bosses are Mossback, Mama Grimmoc, Queen Digestya, and Gatebreaker.Gameplay:The There are only forty levels, which mean you cannot max a character out in every single attribute, but instead must divide them up appropriately. Luckily as you’ll quickly realize, you don’t need to put any points in defense in order to complete the campaign. The game itself is relatively easy and I believe I only died twice through the entire campaign, one time because I forgot to use my potion and the other time because I couldn’t figure out how to defeat the Gatebreaker. The game doesn’t get more difficult as you progress. The game just gets easier because you figure out how to play better. You don’t need to spend any of the games money; in fact I beat the entire game without spending a single coin.  But if you don’t mind playing easy games and just want to hack ‘n slash then this is a really good choice.Multiplayer:Most of the negative reviews focus on the server instability and glitches associated with the multiplayer. Well I never played the multiplayer, so I cannot tell you how that goes. If the other reviews are correct then I would highly recommend avoiding this game if you are looking for a multiplayer co-op experience. On the other hand, if you just want to play a fun little campaign that doesn’t pose much of a challenge then this is a great choice.Jungle Hunt (DLC):Act Five is added to the campaign and finally you can defeat the monsters that began the whole war. Mother Grimmoc has run the jungle and you must go in to retrieve the artifact she stole at the end of the original campaign. The campaign adds an additional five levels which push you to the metal as you fight off new, but similar enemies. They are all essentially stronger versions of past enemies, and in fact one boss is just a larger version of one of the orcs you fight. The game is intense and adds new weapons, but sadly doesn’t add a new village. This means you have to earn the weapons by playing the levels rather than just purchasing them.Result:If you enjoy hack and slack side scrollers then this is the game for you. I would recommend getting this game if you enjoy a single player campaign and don't really care to venture into multiplayer. In all honesty there seems no point to multiplayer as this campaign is so easy with one person adding three more would make the game a cakewalk. Although based on other reviews if you are looking for a four player co-op experience this may not be the game for you. Sacred Citadel offers fun combat, rather interesting enemies, and mixes hack 'n slash combat systems with platformer mechanics. The game is riviting to play by yourself and if you can get it for a good deal it's definitely worth the buy.Pros:+Easy to master combat with few combinations to memorize+Lots of loot and weapons that can easily be obtained throughout the story mode.+Interesting item add-ons that allow you to boost the power of your character beyond your maximum attribute points+Easy, but fun campaign that allows for a single person to enjoy the adventure.+Missions challenges that add replay value for already completed missions+Easy to use controls+They have added DLC to the game.Cons:-No mouse functionality (I set my mouse to preform keyboard functions so I could use my mouse and keyboard)-Does not support 1080p resolution (I just played in windowed mode)-Apparently the multiplayer did not function well (I have no experience on this)-The campaign was relatively short-There is no way to increase the difficulty"

I just do not find this game fun at all and I love arcade style games. If you can get it in a bundle or for less than $2, maybe then buy it, otherwise its just not worth it to me. I do like the art style and paralax scrolling, it may not be polished, but the thing that kills it for me is the clunky gameplay. Very rarely do I not like button mashing, but this one just falls on its face."

Any beat-em-up pro would call this fighting system laughable - your hits totally interrupt regular enemies' animations so they just stand and suffer while you push the main attack button repeatedly. Enemies also tend to come closer, they seem to deliberately gather up around you to get their asses kicked. The danger only arises when a miniboss comes to play with a bunch of minions, especially in a small room, some of them attacking from distance while the boss's attacks interrupt your movement, or when artificial limitations come in play like a beast which can only be killed from the distance. Then you start rolling around the screen trying to thin out the crowd before dealing with the beast. Still the game could be of some interest to the younger ones, achievement hunters and just casual gamers.Простое приключение с драками, ярким оформлением, невнятным сюжетом (чего мы там спасаем?) и туповатой механикой.  Любой специалист в жанре избивалок назвовет здешнюю систему смехотворной - ваши удары полностью прерывают анимацию простых врагов так, что они стоят и страдают пока вы жмете кнопку основной атаки. Враги также стремятся приблизиться к вам, такое впечатление, что специально собираются выхватывать люлей. Опасность возникает лишь в том случае, когда выкатывается небольшой босс с компанией спутников, особенно на небольшом пространстве, кто-то атакует с дистанции, а боссы прерывают ваши движения, либо когда вводятся искусственные ограничения, типа врагов, которых можно убить только дистанционно. Тогда вам приходится кататься по всему экрану, пытаясь проредить толпу, прежде чем взяться за зверюгу. Все же игра может быть интересна детям, охотникам за достижениями и просто случайным игрокам."

Artificial gameplay extension is a giant peeve of mine and this game does it in full force.It's not a hard game, you will eventually complete it after like 10 hours... Yeeeeeeeeeeah, a 10 hour long beat 'em up... *gag me with a wooden didlo* The extra achievements / meta game crap is unreal as well... beat the level under certain conditions so you can get some banana sticker on your level select screen... it's all just bu|_|_ shiz.The end game is basically you fighting the final boss over and over and over and over again until he drops something ridiculous that pretty much dwarfs anything you've ever found up until this point so you might have a better shot at netting some banana stickers for previous level meta crap.There's some DLC level as well that artificially extends the gameplay like some bad WoW expansion. The DLC basically retcons all the gear from the core game, so start grinding out the new final boss for useless gear you don't need...Pi$$ poor game design at best. This game was basically the template for Sacred III, which bombed so hard Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within actually took a dig at it.I wouldn't reccomend buying this game ever, just move along and do something else with your time."

Only problem are big ones you cant knock down , but a potion or ultimate abillity does the trick.The game is only difficult because enemies later on get so much life that your thumbs just hurt from pressing normal attack the whole time.Graphics are okay, some details are pretty good overall its nothing outstanding tough.Story is pretty lame, basic gather this stuff and beat the final boss who got all the relics youve caught.

This pretty much means everything except the boss fights and a few special things are entirely trivial, making it honestly one of the worst beat-'em-up games I've ever played.Also, there's honestly no sane reason for this game to have DLC - the extra chapter is okay enough for the $2 price point, but the random maps added to earlier chapters and the fact a lot of the achievements aren't possible without the DLC pretty much shows that it was the bad kind of ""random stuff we could carve out to sell independently"" DLC.

These types of games are few and far between these days, so when I became aware of Sacred Citadel I had to give it a chance - despite its many negative reviews.Unfortunately, I found that I'm very much in agreement with the game's many detractors. The largest problem Sacred Citadel has is that it just doesn't 'feel' right - there's no sense of impact when you hit an enemy. The action feels unsubstantial, floaty, and fake.While this title has some good ideas, they are completely wasted because of core gameplay that isn't satisfying in the least. Avoid this one.1.5/5"

For instance, when the multiplayer actually did work for us we liked to hang around on a voice com. Playing with a controller and not wanting to reach for the keyboard everytime we wanted to use push-to-talk, we set the activation button to LB (on the xbox 360 pad) seeing as that button isn't used in the game.Just to found out - pressing LB in the lobby opens up whatever team mates steam profile in the steam overlay. Annoying! And there's no way in the settings you can rebind that.Is it worth €9.99? Absolutely not! Even the €2 euros I paid for it is stretching it.No matter what cost, I can't recommend anyone to get this, unless they want to travel through a short and boring single player campaign, and only being able to play with friends sometimes."

,Not Recommended,207930,12125500,"Posted: 16 September, 2014",all,Baron von Arthur,"As a fan of hack & slash, arcade style games, I cannot justify this game's development. I love Streets of Rage, Golden Axe, Castle Crashers, Final Fight, the Konami X-Men and Simpsons games, and the arcade D&D games, but Sacred: Citadel fails in almost every way. What's more is it fails at even being a game that you want to ackowledge in the Sacred game universe. If you're a fan of Sacred 1 or 2, chances are, you will not have a good time here. Even if you play with friends, even if you like arcade games, even if you like humor about flatulence and overweight people, you will likely find this game to just be annoying. I like the occassional joke of bodily functions, but it seems like this game has more fart jokes than actual story. This game lacks style, substance, and almost any familiar tones to the games that made Sacred a great series. I like the art style, I like the animations, but everything else just annoys me. I know it's not the gameplay because if I shut my brain off, I can enjoy myself; but then a character speaks and I want to quit to desktop.Instead of playing this, just play more Sacred 2 or Sacred 1. If you don't own those games, but you're looking at Sacred: Citadel, think again and just do yourself a favor: Buy either of the amazing, top-down, hardcore role-playing games with the right balance of humor, action, story, and character progression.+ Some loot+ Classic arcade style gameplay+ Art style+ Animations- Nothing is Sacred (bah-dum-tish)- No familiar classes (Is that a Seraphim or a wannabe?)- Not enough loot- Not visceral enough- Not near enough role-playing elements- Shared loot- Solo is boring- Lackluster story- Way too easy- Doesn't feel like Ancaria- Not enough familiar enemy types- Leveling doesn't feel rewarding- Humor falls flat- Even co-op can be dull due to game's difficulty"

It lacks the depth of previous Sacred games, being a somewhat shallow beat em up. The gameplay has a little variety with unlockable abilities, plenty of armor and weapons to upgrade, a few environmental hazards and vechicles, and some challenge missions to make grinding a little more meaningful (although grinding isn't really required). I also really enjoyed the music, the smooth animation, and the satisfying impact of your attacks. I recommmend this game if you want a fun modern co-op Golden Axe-esque romp."

,Recommended,207930,28315151,"Posted: 11 December, 2016",all,kikind3840,"My big gripe with people who do negative reviews on brawlers is that they tend to expect way more out of these games than they should. A 2D brawler is more or less going to be 3 things: 1) coop mandatory 2) generally shallow fighting system to allow pick up and play 3) usually short. The mash x and mix it up with y is something you can expect with all brawlers (castle crashers, dd neon, foul play). When you defiant from this formula is when things go bad. Too deep of a combo system scares people from wanting to co-op with less skilled players, too long and you sacrifice fun for padding. There is one thing a brawler can do that will absolutely ruin it, making annoying/too tanky enemy types. This game never does that. 90% of attacks are blockable, all attacks are dodgable and all enemies stagger within reason. To me, this game is a solid brawler. I buy these games for the strict purpose of playing with my wife/friends and this is an absolutely solid brawler. Player types are various enough in how they play to make them interesting.To give you an idea of who I am so you can have a good idea of whether my opinion will likely match yours, here are my favorite brawlers:Double Dragon neonCastle crashersDragons crownTMNT iv Turtles in timeFoul playMagickaHere are the ones I hate:Final exam(all enemies are tanks, and they randomly swam the screen. Super annoying, exploration based gameplay that makes exploring annoying)Streets of Fury Ex (I actually like this game but only if the 99 credit cheat is in. It's a good example of poor brawler gameplay. Early on frustrating enemy types, enemies don't stagger when they stack, player staggers too easily and can get juggled by enemies, no healing, frustrating bosses, block it's worthless)Rampage Knights (Roguelike brawler pretty much tells you how bad it's going to suck)Phantom Breaker (too deep of a combat system, worthless block, non-staggering tank enemies, worthless special)"
