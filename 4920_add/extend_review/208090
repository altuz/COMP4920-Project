The reason for this is simple - the devs have given up on the PC version of this game in favor of the cash-grab that is the PS4 version. Forgetting their roots, the Loadout team has cut ties with the PC world in a real way - they've outright admitted that they are not planning on supporting the PC version of this game any longer. This means that all the problems which are present - unbalanced weapon builds, buggy game types (jackhammer, I'm looking at you), tiny map variety, and unfinished game dynamics - are never going to be improved upon.After a lot of thought, I played my last Loadout match today. This game used to be great - one of my favorites - but the team that made it great has decided to cut off its head. Oh well, onto the next game, I suppose."

Everything else was perfect, and EVERYONE on their forum said exactly the same.Did they listen? Nope. Fat chance. They made a♥♥♥♥♥♥poor attempt to grab the Playstation crowd. In doing so, they neglected everyone that helped them get to where they were. They added an absolutely (unless you're farming) single player game mode. They compltely revamped the entire weapons system.Why did they do this? Who knows.For the record. The fan base didn't die. It didn't even so much as fizzle.The DEVS RAN IT INTO THE GROUND.It looked almost intentional as everyone on the forum (me included) thought they were kidding with the moves they spoke of. We begged and pleaded for them not to alter anything. We had people pour countless hours into testing and gathering data...FOR THEM...FOR FREE.But, it was all for not.I'd like to take this opportunity to give a big SCREW YOU to the devs for ruining possibly the greatest game I've ever played. There was never a dull moment."

This was when the game was good. All of the guns at this point were equally overpowered, so there was no problems with imbalance; Everyone could kill everyone at any time. Also, the game used to give you UNLIMITED GUN SLOTS and five loadouts. You would think that for a game with ""Bajillions of guns"", they would at least give you more than 6 weapon slots and 3 loadouts before you have to pay to get more. At one point, I had about 3 pages worth of guns, and was planning on new ideas for more, because personally, that's where I found it fun. When finishing a match, you were either awarded with an XP boost, extra spacebux, or a gun part. It was a beautiful system which in my opinion should have never been changed.Today's Loadout is rife with awful development choices, like the horribly sluggish tech tree and the addition of another in-game currency known as ""Blutes"". In all honesty, the game would have been better, had they just kept it paid past early development.Also, if you're a new player, you may as well forget about it, because though they offer blute rewards for bot matches, they're reduced, making it very difficult for you to compete against anybody who has better guns and higher ranked weapons parts than you.In summary; What used to be an amazing game has been flipped upside down and ruined by ""fixing"" game systems that were never broken in the first place. Don't waste your time."

Little to no players are on the servers at all. The PVE mode only exists on PS4 and the Devs no longer support the PC version, instead they throw all their money at the PS4 version forgetting this Steam release version of the game. We got the betas for the main game AND the PVE but Play station got the full thing. It was a dream come true for someone like me to finaly have a game that allows for so much weapon customization, it's just too bad it died before it even could improve on alot of it's flaws. If you don't mind an empty game, this game can be a great pass time as a VS Bots mode exists and can be played without human players, however, I cannot recommend it for a more serious gamer."

The mechanics are awesome, the act of simply running and jumping with your character feels great then comes the games niche: the weaponcrafting. While there are many combinations not all of them are viable, however there are enough to cater to all styles of play. There are a wide variety of defensive weapons, aggressive weapons, long range weapons, close range weapons; whatever you find fun you can focus your weapons and loadouts around.The devs work closely with the community and I highly recommend becoming part of the closed beta, there is room for competitive play in the future and hopefully a great amount of success. If you're bored of the current military based fps' then it's definitely worth checking out the game.Here is a link to my Loadout montage playlist, check out the videos and decide for yourself if the game looks worth the time/money investment:http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL53l70ESgmaFnt-P8kNbsAcZX_ItWRqRm&feature=mh_lolz"

Management killed this game, took it's life away from the people who made it. Many bad calls were made. Lets build our own engine on a small budget for an experimental game.

Right off the bat I didn't enjoy the fact that I had to purchase customizable items for my character with real money but it's nice to see that it's not the only way to acquire cutomizable items and weapon customization is strictly with in game points you get after every match. Their are two different types of gameplay, one is for a more general and fun experience to be had with not much of a competitive feel to it while the other is more for competition. This is what I like mainly because it attracts both Casual and Hardcore audiences. Hopefully a trading system can be implemented later for character items (with some kickass background music during matches maybe?)

First and foremost it is an awesome game that can best be described as a 3rd person arena shooter/platformer. The combat is heavily movement based so expect to be jumping, rolling, and sprinting both in and out of combat. This game is fairly fast paced, so expect Times to kill around 1-3 seconds. Weaponcrafting is this game's heart and soul though. You can pretty much create any gun you want if you are willing to take some creative  liberties with it! Examples: railgun? Check! Volcano sniper ala Borderlands? Check! And a million billion other combinations? CHECK!This is a great game that currentley uses the F2P business model (buy cosmetics and other stuff with real money) However the prices are fair and there are a♥♥♥♥♥♥ton of ♥♥♥♥ing sweet cosmetics. To be honest you can custimize your charecter more than your guns, which is pretty extensive on both ends.Also the developers for this game are awesome, totally on point, and real down to earth. Im not a super important player, however on many occasions through weekly live streams, the Dev's hopping in to our Raidcall, in-game and on the forums I have been able to address them with my personal (yet hopefully valid) issues and always get a good response!Buy in and experience the ♥♥♥♥♥iness that is LOADOUT"

Each map is clever, unique and incredibly wacky, making it enjoyable to find a lucky if unintentional jump in order to ambush your foes.The infinite possibilities  in weaponcrafting makes gameplay so much more interesting the more you play; if for example you wanted a sniper rifle, you would probably need to save enough ""blutes"" (weaponcrafting currency) in order to get the part, so in the meantime you have to settle for a different weapon. During the time it takes to earn the sniper barrel you can come accustomed to the alternative, and thus have a combination you never considered before.The gamemodes are all brilliant and fun, putting team-working skills to the test. The only one I dislike is Jackhammersimply because I'm not very good at it.But I've found that whether I lose or not, I can never stay mad because either the gameplay was too much fun or the taunts people do at the end are just too damn funny; they're not so much ""In your face!"" like the Schadenfreude taunt in TF2.Despite what people may assume it's in no way a Pay 2 Win game. The only thing you can pay real-world money for are cosmetics/taunts (One of which is free if you like Loadout on Facebook) weapon/loadout slots and XP or ""blute"" boosts. Cosmetics aren't really importantlike they apparantly are on Team Fortress 2because most of the time your character will probably be torn apart or incinerated. Not to mention cosmetics can be won through the ""daily prize"" bonuses.This game is slowly becoming my favourite shooter.

It is not easy to make a good gun, but that doesn't mean that there's not balance. The more rockets you have in the same magazine, the less damage they do, for example.

,Recommended,208090,8749615,"Posted: 17 January, 2014",all,SaltTM,"Such a hilarious fun game.  From what I've seen on the casual portion of match making there are 4 game modes: CTF, Control Point, Kill Confirmed (From Call of Duty) and this Extraction Mode.  Personally KC and Control Point will be the most fun game modes because it's just constant action.  CTF will be a great competitive mode that I think people will enjoy playing.There are a ton of weapon customizations from the projectiles you shoot to how fast you shoot them and even different weapon types to fit your needs.  You can have fire rockets, pulse beam sniper, there's just a lot of variation that hits different play styles.Character Cosmetics are hilarious, this game is quite mature so if you're a young person I'd disable the nude option.  Because you can actually have a nude character, butt naked.  That's how extreme and bizarre the cosmetics are in this game, lot of stuff to purchase comestically.With this being a F2P game everyone wants to know is ti pay to win?  Not really, there's pay to early a little more xp and in game currency, similar to league of legends, but not really pay to win.  More pay to get ahead faster which if it's a turn off for you that's fine I get it.  It's not as bad as I thought though.Now there are a lot of things you buy with points such as unlocking different grenades from the tech tree as well as other equipment etc... then there's unlocking attachments for your weapons which can help you figure out the style of play you want to pull off.  Right now I'm not good enough to say if you pay for the xp boosts that you'll get so far ahead because you still have to grind out the games like everyone it's not like those F2P fps games where you pay money and boom you have a weapon.  That's silly and this way is much smarter it rewards people for playing the game, and game modes.It's going to be free to play so play it, it's great fun.  You don't have to spend money unless you want to make your character look hilarious.  Other than that, play it try it out and find out for yourself.  Unless you're like me who keeps jumping around FPS games because nothing that has been out has been good enough. ;)I'd rate this game 8.5/10.  Visually looks great, UI is polished and well done, doesn't about a minute to find a game, tons of ways to customize my weapon/character for my playstyle and the way i want it to look.  There are some minor issues I've had like you need to use -DX11.0 in console to launch the game in fullscreen windowed mode as well as things like removing the ability to join on your friends at any given time.  They might change or fix that sooner or later, but overall the game's enjoyable and relaxing.  I don't give it a 10 because I feel like they could tweak a thing here and there like maybe some in game stuff which indicates what's going on for new players and what not, minor stuff.  Maps for CTF are too big things like that.  More personaly things that others might not agree with.  It's in that 8-9/10 range of fun especially for a game that's going to be free.  Haven't played something this polished in a long time."

The gameplay is one of the most solid i have played. After playing this i could not go back to TF2. Im not saying anything bad about it but it just felt slow. Loadout has a great control setup that supports keyboard and mouse and also Controllers. Graphics look great and look like they will age well because of the cartoon style. The action is solid, nothing is OP. The game is great you will be cornered fighting to stay alive shooting fire and rockets and then a teammate will jump up onto a roof and shoot rockets that heal you and then you have the advantage to kill the 2 opponents. Loads of fun. it becomes a free 2 play on the 1st of january. There is no pay to win aspect, money can only buy cosmetics. I would buy the game now and support the devs they do a great job. They are always in the forums checking up to see if they can help."

You have my full attention now.Loadout has brought back an old school style when it comes to shooters. Think Quake/Unreal Tournament. The arena based shooter brings a sense of action that has been lost for quite sometime now. Not only is this action brought back, but it adds a great sense of new to the mix without distorting that old school touch.Loadout brings in a great sense of feel to the shooter genre of today.  Even though you get a cartoony look it does not neglect what the game is, or take away. It adds to it!  From the humorus gore, tuants/emotes, and customization is what makes this game stand on its own feet. The customization brings in sense of endless possiblities, and fun.This game does have microtransactions.  This does not make it a pay to win game.  You are fully able to gain without even throwing any money down.  The way all games with microtransactions should be.  I am not a fan of them myself, but I am not against them if done fairly, and/or justly.  My ownly complaint as a whole with this is I thought that the $9.99 (USD) tag is a bit high for a game with microtransactions. With that being said I am willing to look past that and really take in consideration of what I am playing, and what I am playing on.All in all this game has got me back to a genre I have completly walked away from."

(I am getting a new one, don't worry. ordering it tonight :D) Loadout is to fun of a game to be true. Deserves every award ever. Even awards for best MOBA. And best platformer >:3. The gunplay is amazing, the mobility is super fun to just control, and OH MY GOD THE WEAPONS. Make your dream come true with the millions of rocket launchers you can create, or make a machine gun!! Or a sniper rifle that heals people! or a laser beam that catches people on fire. The possibilities are endless, and the more of the tech tree you unlock, the more you realize you can dream up. Even the grenades and pickups or actives like the shield or jump boots are extremely creative. I wish every shooter i have played were like this one. Even in BETA load out seemed to shine out on top. And that was with like 2 maps with textures -_-. My dream game and guns have come to flourish in this endlessly customizable experience. Who doesn't like outfits in games! I recommend this game TO LITERALLY ANYONE!! This is the best thing that ever happened to me, and the shooter genre itself. No matter what type of game you seem to love, Loadout will grab your attention and be the break that you need with the greatest casual game in existence. Do yourself a favor, and download this FREE GAME!! IT'S FREE!! In my opinion this game should be the most expensive game on the market, even though its casual. To good to be true.

When I had an issue with the game, crashes etc, I'd go to the forums and write about the troubleshooting and experiences with those issues, and with that Edge of Reality developers listened, and fixes that took 5 minutes, stopping others from playing, were now implemented.

They don't have time for us, but they will gladly take the money and leave this F2P to die in the Most Popular page 7, above other developers that have done the same thing.All in all: If you can find a game, it's pretty awesome and you should check out the remnant of what could have been. That's only if you are into Sadism. These guys aren't coming back. They will offload the game to someone else, and that's a BEST case scenario."

,Recommended,208090,602741,"Posted: 25 June, 2013",all,Raikujo,"Loadout is a hilariously violent Third-Person Shooter with plenty of fast-paced action all around. While it is still in beta at the time of this writing, it is still a game that I highly recommend playing for the sheer insanity it brings.The biggest highlight however, is weapon customization. Unless someone goes with a default loadout that the game provides in the beginning, nearly every single gun you see in-game was made by another player. So go ahead and make the most over-powered weapon you can come up with, and wreak havoc with it in online matches. Just take care that the enemy doesn't use your own gun against you..."

76561198069943463,Recommended,208090,8857336,"Posted: 26 January, 2014",all,Bennyester,"So, I've played this game since it's Beta. I kinda hate myself for buying it back then, because all I got now for my previously spent 15€ are a sweater that says ""Beta Tester"" on it, and a t-shirt that says ""Party Crasher"" for beeing in the game back when the servers crashed.However, I don't regret it. It's a good game in a genre which is almost dead: The arena shooter. It's most unique feature is the weaponsforge. You make your guns yourself! At first it won't look like a lot, but as you level up and unlock more parts you will find yourself fighting with yourself over what to put in your new toy. Do I want it to do more damage on impact, or rather make it weaker but give it an afterburn effect? Do I want a rocket launcher that dishes all it's damage out in one blow or do I give it a pentabarrel? Quadrabarrel? Or just a Duobarrel?The only negative aspect is your charackter customisation. Don't get me wrong, there is lot's of stuff to choose from, and the taunts are hilarious. BUT they are pretty expensive. There is no way to buy clothes... or ""clothes"" without investing real money. After putting about 30€ Into the game you should have a unique enough charackter, but some pieces of ""clothing"" are redicioulous. For example: If you play as a male charackter, you can walk arround with your♥♥♥♥♥♥out for juuuuust 35999 gold. Thats pretty much 36000. Paying 15.99€ (so lets just say 16€) gets you 16000 gold. The next lower pack you can buy gives you 7000 gold. So you pay about 32€ just to have your♥♥♥♥♥♥wiggle arround while you sprint all over the battlefield.Other items are affordable tho. The Prices range from 2000 gold per item to the above mentioned♥♥♥♥♥♥value. It's JUST cosmetics tho, if you dont want to pay, go ahead! It doesnt affect the gameplay in any way unless your pixel dong manages to distract someone. It's ""true F2P""."

,Recommended,208090,8906632,"Posted: 29 January, 2014",all,gr8stalin's mustache!,"After being burned by Strike Vector, I turned to Loadout. I wasn't particularly keen on the small playercount per team and the fact that the game is a Third-Person Shooter when it was first startting to garner attention, but I left it on watch. I bought the $10 starter pack on a whim of desparation for any living shooter that had the potential to be FUN and damn. It's not perfect, but it's fun, functional, kinda-sorta balanced, and pretty teamwork-based.Loadout does a great job in a lot of places. It's got a great visual feel to it, remiescent of games like MadWorld and Warsow. You don't die until your health reaches zero, but the more damage you take the more gruesome and damaged your body becomes, which was shown in early Loadout videos. It's a great touch. It runs great on my dated ATI 5770, i5 760, and 4gb DDR3 1333 with zero fooling around with graphical settings. There are four weapons that have a legitimately large amount of customization depth to them, and all four have Quake/Unreal Tournament roots both in their base functions and alternate paths. Unfortunately you can only carry two into battle + two grenades, but hopefully your teammates can pick up the slack. There's dodging in the form of rolling by hitting your ctrl key (default) which is nice and you go to the damn moon when you jump. It's a good feel.It's got a very familar CTF gametype, so even those not accustomed to games like Quake and UT will find familiarity from games like Halo and TF2. The maps are intuitive and make sense even through one match. You've got infinte reserve ammo, which people might find fault with, but there's still reload times to worry about and you still need to actually putyour mouse where the enemy dude is and then start clicking to kill him instead of PRESS X OR MOUSE 1 TO INSTANTLY KILL GUY SOMEWHERE NEAR YOU popularized by Call of Duty, Skyrim, THIEF 4, Skyrim with Guns 3, and TF2's Pyro/Spy/Engineer. Speaking of Call of Duty, the Loadout team has also included a version of the so-called ""Kill Confirmed"" game mode (thank you ELPRESADOR) from the game in Loadout where you kill a guy and nab the energy vial he drops while denying the energy  vials dropped by your teammates if they die.Of course the game isn't totally perfect and I have mixed feelings about certain aspects of the game. I don't like how the Hammer is an insta-kill considering how much health people have, nor am I a fan of free in-game currency being necessary to upgrade weapons. IGC can be garnered fast enough but too many games are relying on this archaic system nowadays. There's no limit to how much you can mash spacebar and jump, so people will be hopping around like nobody's business sometimes and it'll make combat a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥because it'll be annoying to track them but they're not gonna kill you anytime soon unless one of their teammates steps in. There's also no buffer zone that I saw that prevents a guy with better access to different gun paths that can deal slightly more damage than you can because he's higher level from outfragging you 1v1, but I guess it does force people to play intelligently and accurately and general skill levels of people who play shooters have dropped significantly since the UT/Star Wars Battlefront & Republic Commando/FEAR 1 days so it's not too bad. There's a cash shop that gives XP boosts and alternate skins for money, and that's something I have generally ambivalent feelings towards because I hate stupid cash shops with a passion but it's not the kind of cancerous cash shop like the Portal 2, Hawken, or Tribes: Ascend ones.All in all, I'd recommend picking up a beta access copy before the game releases on the 31st because it IS fun and the devs haven't included anything too terrible (yet)PRAYIN' THAT THEY DON'T PANDER TO THE REDDITARD AUDIENCE OR ELSE THAT ♥♥♥♥♥ GON' NEED LIFE SUPPORT JUST LIKE TRIBES ASCEND AND HAWKEN.Update (2/6/2014):After just a bit more than a week of playing the game, I can safely say that I'd give Loadout a really wishy-washy recommendation. Yes, I'm having fun with the game. The in-game currency is still super-easy to garner even in losing games, and I'm getting pretty far in unlocking what I want. There's still stuff people are experimenting with and I'm actually learning from that. The daily prize is always either more IGC or a cosmetic item (totally circumventing actually paying money for them), and I haven't paid a cent more than I did when I hopped on the last days of the Early Access train.However, the beta went on for a long time. A very long time. On release, the dev team was totally unprepared for the volume of people who would download and access the game. Matchmaking tanked hard for several days and playing the game was legitimately difficult because you couldn't even get matched into a lobby.The movement is completely ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. It is the farthest thing from skill-based. Any moron can mash their spacebar and press a directional key and become a dodging machine. Luckily for people with actual experience in arena shooters, tracking them is just time consuming. However, if they're part of that elite few of extremely early testers who have ranked up gear, they'll have better damage output than you will because their shots will totally outclass yours in terms of damage per singular shot because parts upgrade over time and do more damage. Combine that with the mindless mashing and you've got a system that rewards players who simply have more playtime, not more skill. I mentioned this earlier in the review but now I'm in the position of simply dealing more damage than another player purely because I've got more time in Loadout.Fire ammunition is the most common mod for offensive weaponry. This results in constant trades in which whoever ends up edging out those last few bullets and wins ends up dying immediately afterword from Damage Over Time (DOT). Because of this, healing (especially overhealing) is incredibly important if you haven't unlocked the personal shield (which is a completely different section) and even then overhealing still gives you that armor stack so familiar from Quake/UT/TFC/TF2. The problem with this is that it's super rare to find someone who actually realizes that having a healing weapon is important, and on top of that low chance there's another slim chance of the entire team realizing that if they stay in the green explosions from their buddies, they'll get healed and get overheal. Of course, both of those have a super-low chance of actually occuring. When they do, however, you'll pretty much have a guaranteed victory if you play close together.All in all, even a week later, I'll still tell you that Loadout is fun. But if you do decide to sink time into it, prepare for a long annoying walk up an easy-to-climb hill. It'll probably be a lot more fun if you play it in a private game with your friends because they're probably not gonna be assblasted tryhards (unless you're friends with ""that guy"")"

You'll get a cartoony, still polished look with amazing effects and funny characters. The weapons and gadgets are decently balanced. There are some strong set up's, sure. But even the very first Assault Rifle and Launcher can be pretty effective weapons.But if you can't master the movement in the game, strong weapons won't help you either.The gamemodes are fun, each got a little twist. For example, it's not ""Capture the flag"" but ""Capture the hammer""and the hammer-carrier can attack with it 5 times.

,Recommended,208090,9626585,"Posted: 25 March, 2014",all,Domu,"Loadout is a great game. Fast paced, lots of different and interesting ways to customize your weapons as well as your characters and hilarious taunts/dances to show off at the end of every round. Getting the hang of this game can be a bit difficult. Playing against the bots can be a pain as they never miss and if your teammates can't coordinate VS players/bots, you're bound to lose easily. This game does seems to have the old fashion jump around and shoot tactic, but it feels like Unreal Tournament to me. The cartoonish style of the game was a good idea, the facial expressions have me laughing out of my chair sometimes, even when they're dying (Which is sad to say). Never forget the almighty twerk. You were warned....Downfalls to this game :There isn't a K/D or Ranking Match Up system. Some people play a LOT more than others and it shows. Leveling up your weapon parts adds a slight, but significant advantage on the battlefield against players who are new or don't play as much. I think it needs it because i hate being paired up with a bunch of noobs who don't know how to play extraction or any of the modes honestly. A tutorial may be necessary to help prevent this problem, as the game lacks one. Most of the modes are a bit straight forward, but could be confusing to newcomers i suppose. Though, the game is rated 18+ and not 10 & up. That's right kids... i know when you're too young to play this game... It's kinda obvious... Reading is power!For some reason, i can only play this game in small doses. I can't play this game hours on end for some reason, it doesn't hook me in like lots of other games I play. This game is fairly new, I was part of the Beta and it obviously isn't going to have a bunch of content from the start. So i'm hoping to see tons of new items come into the game which may make it more desirable.Overall rating - 7.8/10"

And surely not because death seems suddenly appealing. The person in whom Its invisible agony reaches a certain unendurable level will kill herself the same way a trapped person will eventually jump from the window of a burning high-rise. Make no mistake about people who leap from burning windows. Their terror of falling from a great height is still just as great as it would be for you or me standing speculatively at the same window just checking out the view; i.e. the fear of falling remains a constant. The variable here is the other terror, the fire’s flames: when the flames get close enough, falling to death becomes the slightly less terrible of two terrors. It’s not desiring the fall; it’s terror of the flames. And yet nobody down on the sidewalk, looking up and yelling ‘Don’t!’ and ‘Hang on!’, can understand the jump. Not really. You’d have to have personally been trapped and felt flames to really understand a terror way beyond falling.”"

Loadout is a team based all multiplayer 3rd person shooter and gives us a fresh breathe of air away from multiplayer games like Team Fortress. With tons of character customization and weapon customization, there's no way to really master this game. Build your gun, test it, and use it against your enemies. You also have the ability to name your weapons and when you are killed holding that weapon other players can pick up and use your gun. So make sure to name it something hilarious.

,Recommended,208090,9999895,"Posted: 2 May, 2014",all,TheMLGReploid,"Simply put, Loadout is awesome. As stated by the trailer, the diversity of weapons is incredible, however not all of them are applicable to playing well, but regardless it's very easy to create a weapon unique to you.First off, how it looks. Many people have stated Loadout looks like TF2, and they do share a cartoony style, but Loadout is much edgier, being quite gory and excplicit, it's nothing too bad though, as it's all extremely over the top. The world of Loadout hasn't really been explained, despite the fact that the game is in 3.0, but regardless it's one of the more unique you'll ever find. Most of the maps are either enclosed or floating in midair and all of them have unique quirks, whether it be a giant drill in the center or multiple alleys and corridors the maps are all diverse and colorful, unlike some other FPS games.Though there isn't a ton of music in Loadout, the music that's there is great, suiting the edgy, macho style of the game.Lastly, the gameplay, Loadout is a hell of a fun time, to say the least. There are tons of different ways to play, maximized by your nearly infinite arsenal of guns. Not only can you choose from four chassis and 5 payloads, but you can also change the scope, stock, barrel, and trigger, with certain chassis having even more options to choose from. There is also another set of items you can use called equipment, which range from deploable sheilds, to grenades, to disguises ( but of course ). The way Loadout plays is focused largely on mobility, with there being many different ""techniques"" to move around. My one complaint however, is how easy it is to make a high fire rate weapon, jump around holding down the fire button and win. It can get frustrating, making weapons designed for situations, and then running into an overpowered weapon great at almost any situation, despite the fact that it takes next to no skill. I would reccomend the developers reduce the fire rate or range of these rapid fire guns in order to balace it out. Aside from that however, it's all good.I would reccomend Loadout to anybody looking for edgy, hectic fun, but if you prefer something with a bit more... elegance, this may not be for you, welcome to the gun show."

SureWant a laser beam that shoots like a minigun?  No problemThere's many possiblilitys, and you can unlock new things for your weapon with a tech tree, so it's endless.Gameplay is fun and fast paced.  This isn't some simple call of duty game, you gotta learn to jump and roll to survive.  The controls are fluid.You can also customize your character.  You can be 3 different default characters, Helga, Alx, and T-Bone.  And they all have different outfits to equip.  Plus, there's taunts which you can use in-game or if you won the game in the victory screen, or see the victorious team taunt you.The only thing is mature content.  There is a pretty decent amount or gore, and nudity, although that's censored.  You can luckily turn these off in the options menu.But as any free-to-play game, there is microtransactions.  But it's not really a pay-to-win thing, since you just use money to move faster along, by buying money, which I'm happy for.  You can unlock everything easily just by ranking up and playing/Pros:-Good controls-Good graphics-Gun customization-Turn off mature content-Hard to get bored ofCons:-Microtransactions (not P2W though)-Matchmaking can take a whileI would recommend this highly.

Let me start with the basic mechanics, just from the movement alone you can tell what a frantic game this is  gonna be. The amount you will mash space and control is staggering and I fear I may have repetitive strain injury. There is nothing like the satisfaction one can have when you are diving for that health kit in a firefight or jumping over a group of enemies raining fire and brimstone down on their wee heads with your flamethrower cannon sniper gun. The game modes are delightfully unique and if not completely original, they are a great new spin on existing ideas. The real beauty of this game comes from the weapon customization. You want a ♥♥♥♥ing cannonball sniper?! You got one. You want a ♥♥♥♥ing healing machine-gun?! Guess what? You can have one. Loadout pushes the boundaries of multiplayer mayhem and I can only imagine the fun the devs had from making it.

The fun part is collecting weapon parts and equipment to create your own unique Loadouts.

You can however make your own character with in game money, if you don't wanna pay, its completely fine.

,Not Recommended,208090,8936291,"Posted: 1 February, 2014",all,Saturn,"It gets boring pretty quickly.The seemingly ""endless"" weapon combinations are all barred behind toll booths that require you to purchase with ingame gold (which would be fine normally), but you will discover that it is very difficult to get gold without having to play forever and therefore they have an ingame cash machine that will want you to use real money to get gold... yup. So what that means is that the game is very much pay-to-win.There are only a few gametypes and all matches last no more than 10 minutes.The gameplay itself is pretty solid, but it would be much better if the maps had been bigger, tiered and more elaborate. So far the five or six maps available are all small and very simple, providing little varied game scenarios, which leads to the game becoming boring after half an hour.The gore aspect of the game is funny at first, but there are only about 8 different things that can happen to you (head disappear leaving only eyes, burnt body, destroyed leg, hole in stomach and the like).The gun building is by far the game's strongest aspect, but it is dulled down due to everything being locked behind ""toll booths"". At first when I started I hate money enough to make a decent enough weapon, but upon creating my second weapon I found that I lacked the gold to purchase the parts I wanted.It is a free game so you should try it out just to see for yourself, but if you had to purchase a funny shooter game I would not recommend this game and instead I would point you in a different direction."

As others have mentioned, you don't need to spend money on in-game items to progress or unlock weapons. The limitation is in the number of different loadouts/guns to choose from in a match. However, this limitation benefits the gameplay because it forces players to use the same 1 or 2 loadouts the entire match, which means that you have to get comfortable with each weapon's play-style.

They allow you to custom-choose each piece that makes up the gun, such as the stock, ammo, how the ammo projects through the air, the element of the ammo, the barrel, the scope, the size/efficiency of the magazine...pretty much anything you'd want.  The best part about it is that literally any combination will work together!I also enjoy their spiced-up versions of classic shooter game modes, such as capture the flag and standard deathmatch.  In deathmatch, the objective is the kill your opponent AND collect the vial of ""blutonium"" that their character drops.  The important part is to actually get to the vial of blutonium and pick it up before one of the opposing team players does(this is called a ""denial"").  If you aren't able to pick it up, you just missed a chance to score the core points of the game for your team(the twist is that killing doesn't rack the points up - the vial collection does).In capture the flag, the flag is actually a big♥♥♥♥♥hammer that can kill opposing players in 1 big hit.  The catch is that the hammer only has 5 charges to perform hits during your run with it, but if you manage to kill opposing players during your run back, the hammer takes that number of kills and respectively ups the score your team receives when you manage to bring the hammer back to your base.  I think adding that one little aspect(the flag is actually a weapon in-and-of itself) is a neat little twist to an old fan favorite.All-in-all, this game is definitely worth a buy for any shooting game fanatic.  If you're on the edge, all I have to say is:  it's a minimum of $10 - get it!  These devs obviously know what they're doing, and they need your help in this early access stage to get the word out and release more content!  If you're happy with the game, go back to their store and purchase the starter or founders packs that will further help the dev team!*****EDIT*******This game has long since died out, so I can no longer recommend it.  The game held a lot of potential, but the devs decided to cut and run on the PC community, and instead focus on the console version from my understanding.  No new content, updates, or support of any kind is to be found here.  Do not support the behavior of these devs in any way."

I don't need to say much more. Others who have posted reviews have already taken the words from my mouth when I was thinking about this game a while ago. Really, all I have to say is it was the best beta game I ever put my money into at the time. To better times people, to better times. :)"
