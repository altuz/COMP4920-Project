Unfortunately, with Myst, it's quite true. Much like any other fantasy world (Middle Earth, Elder Scrolls, etc) the ages of Myst and your significance in them can only be understood in the context of the game's universe. Myst is about exploring ages, and figuring out puzzles, but in truth, its about so much more. Its about a lost tribe called the D'ni, and the legacy of the man who would eventually save them (Atrus). This is not a one part movie, but a story of which bits and pieces are scattered among other books and games. With Myst V you are getting the conclusion to a very long story. For that reason, it may seem short. But when you play the game with the knowledge of the other games, its an ending that seems mostly appropriate and is needed to cap off an otherwise endless story. Is it perfect? No. Does it work? yes. If you do not play the other games in the series, then it at the very least recommendable that you read the books. Not only do they fill in alot of blanks, but also give you some insight into the characters and why they are significant."

I even collected a few of the accompanying novels, I was that crazy for the series. To be honest, I wasn't even aware of any other games in the series beyond Myst IV (which I have not played yet), until recently. I really wanted to like this game, from the very start. But I couldn't help but feel disappointed by Myst V.The graphics are beautiful, like with any other Myst game. I couldn't help but feel the worlds were smaller somehow, though, and less explorative. Almost restrictive.  I can appreciate how they are trying something different compared to the other games in the series; I just don't enjoy the outcome of it. For instance, full motion video had been used in the first four Myst games--and used very well. You rarely had contact with anyone within the games themselves, which added to the overall isolation and atmosphere of the games.  And while Myst V only adds two characters into the mix, Escher and Yeesha, the impact just isn't the same due to predictable 3D rendered characters replacing the FMV. Their presence inside the game sort of ruins the notion of being isolated on some deserted world.Oh well.Another small but vital complaint: the voiceovers used during journal readings. Just like the rest of the series, journals provide key insight and deepen the backstory of the game. I remember it being a very immersive experience in Myst, picking up a journal and reading and re-reading it to myself at my own pace. This time around, the journals are read for you, in the voice of Yeesha. Don't get me wrong, the voice acting of both Yeesha and Escher are very well done. It just ruins the experience of reading it for myself, and often ends up becoming an annoyance throughout the game.My biggest problem with Myst V, though, are the puzzles themselves. When you think of Myst, you think of challenging, physics-based puzzles which require a good amount of patience. Even the hardest puzzle could be figured out eventually, as long as you paid strict attention to clues and weren't afraid to use a little trial-and-error. I never used a walkthrough for Myst, Riven or Myst III (and Riven was an incredibly difficult game). But I found myself breaking down for help several times in Myst V. The puzzles are frustratingly difficult, due to the fact that some of the clues are either misleading, or non-existent. I didn't really enjoy the use of the slate/tab mechanism, either, and found it frustrating as well.If this game is part of some Myst/Cyan/Ubisoft bundle on sale, then by all means go for it. But I would not personally recommend this game by itself."

I played Myst and Riven when i was a child, I continued with Exile and Revelation and I absolutly enjoyed every single one of them. Unmatched when it comes to atmosphere and puzzles. I remember these masterpieces to be some of the brighest lights in my history of playing video games. So it was just a matter of time until i would pick Myst V and finally now when i found it (fortunatly being on sale, yay) there was no way around it. Sadly...I dont understand why this game wears the name ""Myst"". The story is flat, the puzzles are somehow boring and they didnt pull me into the game. I miss the once so excellent leveldesign and its awsome surreal enviroments who seemed so alive and fascinating. I also appreciated the real actors...its was one of the key features for me. Myst V at the other hand looks dead and flat. I dont feel any interest to go ""deeper"" into this. What a shame..."

My assuption was that it would feel different from the other Myst games. Many years later, on sale on Steam, I thought ""for $10, why not give it a try"".My reveiw is mixed, first the pro's:1. If you know the Myst story, it is a fitting end in terms of plot. You should probably play it for the closure.2. The worlds (with the exception of the 4th Age with the arena, which was a snore) are still as beautiful and imaginative as ever. I was particularly impressed with the ""Observatory"" age.3. The game gives you the ability to place in one of several modes, from ""classic"" to ""free-mode"", so the change of format did not affect the game as much as I thought it would in that regard.4. The game adds new elements to the Myst world, so there is more to discover!Now the con's:1. The change from real actors to computer animated motion capture made a HUGE difference for immersion in the game world. Frankly, every time a character was on sceen they looked rediculous. Because of their rediculous appearance I found it really hard to accept the dialogue genuinely... something that never happened to me before even with some of the over-acting in the rest of the series.2. The puzzles were far too easy and the worlds far too small. I got through the game super fast (my log says 68 minutes but I think that's innacurate). Basically one day. I bought it Thursday morning and finished it Friday afternoon. That included all reading, puzzle solving, and even some down time where I went to do this and that but left the game running.  Myst took me a good week. Riven probably 2-3 weeks. Exile and Revelation somewhere inbetween, and Uru... well I never finished that ;). This was therefore the shortest and most dissapointing of the series in terms of bang for buck or immersability (whichever means the most to you).3. The plot was too predictable. The big twist at the end can be seen from... well, from the beginning. Myst is about Mystery, judging who will be evil and who will be good, and finally making a decision that will determine all (p.s. I died twice when playing the original Myst... like everyone else probably)! End of Ages was about the end of that mystery, there was no secret what should be done (though I tried the other options first in order to see the alternate endings).Conclusion:I enjoyed the game, but it felt like a ""Myst Snack"" rather than a ""Myst Meal""... and I was hoping to end my Myst experience with something like a Christmas dinner, not microwave popcorn. Oh well. Don't buy it unless you want plot closure or just to see the imaginative worlds."

The voice acting is believable, though the story is not nearly as good as the previous entries. If you're a Myst fan, give it a try, otherwise it might not hold your attention very long. Either way, be careful about what you're writing on your tablets, an entire age can be accidently skipped if you happen to draw a symbol that appears all over that particular age."

It's true exploration is not as grand as it was in Riven and the puzzles are not very difficult, but it in no way takes away from the story.

You have to go through the entire thing like in Myst III and probably IV, but it's been a looooong time since I played that one."

While it is nice to move around freely, the graphics were terrible.  I enjoyed MYST and Riven because of the detailed, immersive environments, even if you had to move from spot to spot.  Furthermore, the clues, or lack thereof, in this game was mind numbingly irritating.  Nothing else in the franchise left you with so little to work with.  Finally, the story was far from engaging.  The constant interruptions from Esher were unnecessary and stalled gamepley.  Honestly, I am surprised this was made by the original developers as it missed the mark so badly."

Well, I was pretty apprehensive. Hardcore fans of the series tend to dismiss this game, but my apprehension was misplaced as I thoroughly enjoyed this.Pros:-Very clever puzzles-Gorgeous Zones-Amazing Atmosphere-Puzzles are incredibly rewarding-Creative story, interesting characters-Multiple endingsCons:-Cheesy (Less than 4 but moreso than 3)-Not super difficult, about on par with Exile-Tablet mechanics can be buggy/frustrating/annoying-Acceptable but otherwise unmemorable soundtrack (whereas the other games have stellar soundtracks)-Quite short (ties into the difficulty)Most puzzles here are very fair and some are downright brilliant (Parts of Noloben and all of Todelmer and Laki'ahn), but as mentioned eariler the new tablet mechanic can be quite confusing and clumsy.

A departure from the beautifully pre-rendered graphics of the previous Myst games (Excluding Uru), End of Ages uses a realtime game engine to render - and it shows. This is a 2005 game which, while it makes good use of technology of the time, does not compare to previous titles. The interactivity is limited and feels forced, while the story is lacking and makes little sense as to why you're there and what you're doing."

Whereas previous entries to the series offer so much to entice the player, THIS game offers much, much more. It's got:* Empty, 2-dimensional characters whose struggles you can't possibly care about.*A vague, loosely-formed plot with new lore that is poorly explained and quite uninteresting for a Myst game.*The exploration of the differernt ages feels very restrictive and linear compared to previous games.*The soundtrack, which the Myst franchise has always been praised for, is unbelievably bland.*The introduction of new concepts that offer nothing to the story. In particular the use of the tablets is much more of an inconvenience  than a challange and are often frustrating to accurately use with a mouse.*Major characters from the previous games that feel like more of an afterthought.They really phoned it in on this one.

First, the sadistic puzzles.  Here's an example (spoiler!): at some point you come across controls for a cable tram connecting two points.  One switch controls the direction (point A to point B, or point B to point A).  A nearby lever gives the tram a push in that direction.  When you discover these controls, you are at point A and the tram is at point B.  Point B is so far away you actually don't know that the lever is doing anything, but 37 (seriously) 5-second pushes of the lever later, the tram is at point A.  You get on the tram and discover a floor lever...that doesn't work, because the tram is powered from the other side.  Fine.  After more wanderings you get to point B via a completely different route, only to discover that the tram has to be in point B's dock in order for you to proceed, which requires you to go back to point A and hit that leverl 37 more times.  What was the point of this puzzle, Cyan?  To waste time on a mindless clicking goose-chase?  What part of this did the design team sit down and decide would be fun:- that the tram is not in the screen when you're pumping the lever, so you don't know what it's doing?- that it takes *37* lever pumps to get the tram across the gap?- that the tram doesn't actually work when you finally get it to point A?- that after all that, the tram actually needs to be at point B to proceed, so the player has to run all the way back and manually reset it?Similarly, there are more ""guess-and-run-for-a-while-and-check"" puzzles -- things that require you to try random combinations and then spend a substantial amount of time running somewhere to see what, if any, effect it had.The dialog also greatly detracts from the game, because most of it is vague, stream-of-consciousness wistful regret that's not related to the puzzles.Overall, I'm very optimistic about the upcoming Obduction game, because Rand Miller specifically said they're trying to harken back to the days of Myst and Riven.  Those were good games that had far more puzzles than sadism.  As for Myst V, I gave it my best shot, but the poor design of that tram puzzle warranted nothing less than a rage-quit."

,Recommended,208110,25939043,"Posted: 8 October, 2016",all,andermachines,"A decent conclusion to the Myst series (and unfortunately a very final one at that) which suffers from the lack of a strong story & 3D polygon visuals which look primitive by today's standards. I think this was originally intended to be a part of Uru that they later decided to develop into a game of its own after the MMO aspect of Uru got shelved & they stopped designing new ages for it, or something. For some reason this felt really short compared to the other games in the series, though its puzzles aren't any less challenging for it - however, after playing the other games they seem more than a little formulaic. A new mechanic is introduced where you link to ages not through a book but through pedestals constructed by a non-human race called the Bahro, who are either moving into formerly D'ni-colonized ages  or reclaiming them after having been driven away; these pedestals also have tablets which you carry around (sometimes you have to drop them) and can write symbols on them which you find in each age in order to communicate with them & have them use special powers specific to each age (such as creating geothermal energy, or altering the flow of time, etc.), or carry the tablet to secondary pedestals throughout the ages to which you can link through the main one. The game's detection of the symbols drawn on the tablets can be very finicky, though, and in one instance was so sensitive that I must've kept redrawing the symbol close to a hundred times before I was able to get one of the Bahro to understand it, when each time it was more or less the same symbol with minor variations. That in particular was extremely frustrating & I doubt the developers intended the player to have that experience.The story line is only vaguely related to the previous Myst games, takes place at the same time as Uru (which practically confirms that it was originally supposed to be a side quest for that game) & implies that the player could not be the same ""mysterious stranger"" character they are in the four preceding games. The player is guided by Yeesha, daughter of Atrus and Catherine who was also the guide in Uru, who explains that she is predestined to have the power to restore D'ni (she believes she is what is called ""The Grower"") if given a certain tablet locked onto a Bahro pedestal right outside Atrus's study on K'veer in D'ni (the place you find him at the end of Myst and the beginning of Riven), which you unlock by finishing each of the game's ages; but she tells you never to give it to her under any circumstance lest she actually restore D'ni. Your other guide is a man named Escher who speaks in a strange accent (Dutch? hence the name Escher?) which is sometimes hard to understand, and in each age tells you what it functioned as for the D'ni race, how great the D'ni were, how primitive the Bahro are & how dangerous & deluded Yeesha is, trying to get you to take his side. So at the end of the game, like the end of the other games in the series, you're given a crucial decision as to who to trust & what course of action to take. For some reason, though, the ending feels anticlimactic. It may be that the overall story never really affects the player's course of action up until that point, and consequently you can get through all of the game without listening to anyone or reading any of Yeesha's journals, except to find symbols for a certain endgame puzzle (another relic of the series). There aren't any really effective dramatic monologues from skilled actors such as Brad Dourif, who was the antagonist in Myst III & really made the whole story come alive; it may be that 3d-rendered polygons just don't have the same expressive power as human beings, certainly not in 2005 and not when you can always choose to look away. This game feels like an addendum to a series that's already been wrapped up & completed, one which Cyan actually wanted to end with Riven & only made this game because two more had been previously developed by other studios & released as sequels. It feels unnecessary, or at the very least optional, for those who liked Uru. It seems like the reason they made it was just to put the final nail in the coffin of the series. So long, I guess."

Poor Yeesha, who was such a sensible, inquisitive little girl in Myst IV, has gone even crazier than she was in Uru. And the storyline of the game is focused around freeing a race of creatures called the Bahro, who pretty much came out of left field (they were mentioned vaguely, but never directly shown, in Uru).But, D'ni storyline aside, the main reason I loved the Myst series, was as a ""walking simulator"", giving you the opportunity to explore exotic, beautiful, ruined locations, and piece together their history. This game delivers on *that* in a big way. The worlds are well realized, the puzzles and abandoned D'ni machinery are fascinating, and you get to see new parts of D'ni itself, which have been off limits before. And at the end you get a nice little closing scene, which puts a little bit of closure on the series.The storyline would probably be pretty nonsensical if you haven't read the books and played the previous games in the series (Myst, Riven, Myst III, Myst IV, Uru), but I think as a walking simulator it would probably still stand up, as long as you don't mind a large component of mysteriousness. That said, you can get Myst, Riven, and Uru here on Steam (and on gog), so if you're going to play those, do play them first.

This may be a big disappointment to Myst fans seeing as the previous games (Especially Riven) are very grounded and masters at storytelling through gameplay. But don't let that hold you back from enjoying what is otherwise a properly clever game.The story revolves around a mad scientist and a hippie who battles for control over an all powerfull object (yeah, it's that dumb). The scientist is pretty cool as a character, although he is a bit over the top at times and nowhere near the trilling genius of Ghen (the scientist psychopath from Riven). The hippie however is cringeworthy and spews bad methaphors in an attempt at wisdom. Unless you enjoy that sort of thing it will take away some of your enjoyment.But credit where credit is due: The solution to the final puzzle that wraps up the story is actually pretty clever and ties nicely into the gameplay. The pace is good and you spend most of your time in this game actualy playing it and making progress (not watching cutscenes like most adventure games).Other than a dissapointing story the rest of the game is pure joy. The visuals and atmosphere are AMAZING (even today). The game runs perfect on modern systems and has almost no bugs. Music is also good but not at the level of some of the other games in the series. The game is easy to play and works great both as a point&click and as a free moving FPS (choice is yours).The puzzles are the main star and they are as good as ever. Many of them are really clever and will make you feel like a god when you solve them. They tie nicely into the game-world and helps build up that mysterious lonely atmosphere that Myst is known for. All of them are both interesting and fair, there is not a single ""bad seed"" that relies on stupid game-logic or pixel-hunting.As always with Myst games the puzzles expects you to examine and undertsand the environment in which they are located and what the purpose of the machinery you are manipulating actually is. You must look past just the interactive objects and study the world as a whole to make sense of it all. Simple logic or ""trying everything"" will not get you anywhere.Just look past the horrible story/writing and have fun, gameplay is stellar here."

The Myst story swan dives over the shark with the Bahro from Uru, shoehorning a class warfare storyline that should have stayed in The Book of D'ni where it came from, and where it applied to D'ni's long lost twin civilization.Puzzles are simple in the Uru tradition, with clues located fairly near to where they're needed. Other puzzles require stumbling through controls until you work out what it wanted you to do in the first place. Still others require reading Yeesha's whiny journals to find the symbol they want you to draw.The drawing mechanic is just fine. Utterly out of place in a Myst game, but it's no worse than the godawful horns on Haven in Myst 4.Pick it up to finish the story, or let the story have ended at Revelation, you decide."

It was shoter than the other games, and doesnt seem to follow the story of the originals at all. Also, the puzzles are simpler, requiring very little effort to figure them out, and there are far fewer of them. The new gameplay mechanic of the tablets is intresting, however, and became an intresting way of creating puzzles that fit in the world, and didnt seem out of place, like creating wind to make a creature move (as a simple example).For those who didnt want to read what I wrote, here is a simplified list:Pros:- Better Graphics and controls- Unique gamplay mechanicsCons- Easy Puzzles- Few Puzzles- Disconnected StoryOverall, I would say not to get this game. However, if you are one of the curious ones, who plan to get this game regardless of this review, I would suggest getting it only while on sale."

As of the game you do have to be a skilled drawer as you have to draw on tablets to communicate to the Bahro. For instance if you want wind on your age you have to draw the symbol for wind exactly or pretty close. If you do it right other things can be done. For instance you draw wind and a previous creature who blocks your path can't see because things are blowing around and moves out of the way. Anyway it was a cool story, play through it once. I thought it was ok."

Fand die Welten auch wieder toll, das erkunden finde ich jedesmal aufregend. Aber das Ende - naja, ich hätte noch gerne etwas Zeit zum herumstöbern!
