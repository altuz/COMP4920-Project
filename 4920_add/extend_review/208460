Everything looks bad including the sound and talking. Everybody sound stupid in the game and well, could it be more rehashed crap we've seen 10 thousands time the last 15 years? For god sake starcraft 1 today after 15 years is a more inovative and fun game to play than that crap that come from who knows where.I don't mind indie dev with poor graphics as long as the game is fun, but this crapfest is just not worth it. I got it for cheap on black friday sale and i still feel like i got riped off.STAY FAR AWAY FROM THAT GAME! DO NOT PRESS THE BUY BUTTON, YOU WILL LEAD A HAPPIER LIFE!"
,Recommended,208460,8325616,"Posted: 26 December, 2013",all,=LG= Devil,"The graphics and playstyle remind me of Universe at War, Command & Conquer, and Supreme Commander.  The single player campaign is good.  I don't know what everyone is complaining about.  There are things that frustrate me a little such as no low health warnings for a Hero that you must keep alive to complete a mission.  Most of the time I've failed missions it's because a Hero died without warning.  Being attacked doesn't always trigger a warning either.  There's a LOT that needs to be done to make the single player campaign more enjoyable.  It's worth the $10 I paid during a holiday sale.  I wouldn't pay more than $20 for this game.  Haven't tried multiplayer and have no desire to because of how slow the game is.  It took me 20 minutes to build an army of 100 soldiers and unit cap is 100.  Painfully slow to build reinforcement units.   I love the tech tree!  It's simple and intuitive.  Wish there were more upgrades to choose for each unit.  Basic tech tree is also it's weakness it becomes too basic too quickly.  The menus and hotkeys are good.  Everything about this game is pretty good.  I've really enjoyed it so far.  I absolutely loved Universe at War and Supreme Commander.  If you like those RTS games then you'll like Tryst."

Everything feels like it hasn't undergone a final quality pass, so much so that it's obvious in less than an hour that you've bought and paid for a half-baked effort."

The game seems as if the quality insurance manager was on vacation.Do yourself a favour and learn from other people's failure. STAY AWAY FROM THIS GAME!!!"

,Not Recommended,208460,31427986,Posted: 28 April,all,Verdantil,"Tags: RTS - Real Time StrategyAdditional Tags: Delete Local Content & Remove from Library (4Gbs)TLDR: A seriously offputting title, It is not good, and yet it does enough right not to be bad, and somehow manages not to be average. It is just in that uncanny valley where it cant be enjoyed and for no single discernable reason, to the point where, you start doubting that you enjoy RTS titles, and it starts damaging your perception of the genre.Review: Tryst is a sewn together RTS with russian and american voice acting, audio clips that are oddly cut to miss certain words at the beginning of each line, some dialogue script that makes no sense, at least one instance of missing FX files for a cannon. Also something isnt right, the human buildings have zerg-like orgnanic stuff on them, implying some kind of hybrid race, but the race you play is 100% human story wise. By the time you get to the fourth mission  some of that is somewhat adressed, but it still would mean that there is a missing race, or at least missing assets for non hybrid buildings. There are only two races, and the campaign is mostly a hero management affair, where you go from objective to objective micromanaging and drawing your well of patience to grind at the map. The core design seems okay but it seems like it lacked some playtesting and ease of use. Basically you got your three basic military buildings for infantry vehicles and air support, and then you can further customize those by spending ressources at the upgrade building to tweak each unit for the situation on the front line. I assume there could be a fair bit of strategy that you could apply here, but it would take a fair bit of practice, and there is no reward in line for putting in the effort, since the community for this game is dead. Also I suspect some upgrades are not quite balanced with others. There are only 5 maps and the campaign is a rather superficial affair of, a new generation dealsl with the alien menace, learns to put their differences aside and come together as one human block against the human traitors and the alien overlord, then you make out to warn earth.The multiplayer maps available in skirmish mode for perusal are mostly a ton of ressource and strategic nodes all littered around, and must be captured and held until your economy and strategic bonuses allow you to overpower the enemy and roll them over. Its not a bad concept per say but it also doesnt feel all quite right.So in conclusion, I would seriously advise to skip this title, it sits at 4gbs, the campaign is very tedious, the multiplay is dead and mastering this game is more effort than it is worth and sometimes even feel that you are putting more in than the devs have with the overall lack of polish"
