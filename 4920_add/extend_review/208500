Apart from a few annoyances (the penalty system mostly) the game is awesome. Having played 500 hours plus both in single player and online, and all the modes, i can truly recommend this game for any racing fan really."

I can't recommend it in its current state. The game is dazzling to look at, and the sound design is nothing short of incredible with my Soundblaster Z sound card. The feel of the tracks are authentic, making it as if I'm really there. However, the game has a fatal flaw, which results in frustration and ultimate dissatisfaction. The penalty system in the game is simply too stringent. Codemasters said the issue was fixed in F1 2013, but it makes me wonder why they don't patch/fix the issue in this game.There is nothing more frustrating than to be trapped in a group of cars bunched in a corner, and getting a drive through penalty for ""illegal blocking."" Or a car driven by the AI bumping up against you, and acquiring another drive through penalty for unsportsmanlike behavior. I just spent an hour and a half in a race with 28 laps to go, and accrued two such flags in one lap. That pretty much guaranteed a last place finish. This needs to be fixed."

In 2012 Vettel broke the record for the most pit-stops in the season(15)and equaled most races wins in a single season with Schumacher(13).In addition to seeingseven drivers win the first seven races, the 2012 season broke several records. The calendar for the season included twenty races, breaking the previous record of nineteen, which was first set in 2005.

Graphics are good even compared to some newer version of F1 games. The game features 20 circuits and 24 drivers battling for Championship title. Race through famous circuits such as Monaco, Spa, Monza, and Intergalos and become next World Champion. As you probably heard AI in this game aren't too much competitive compared to older versions, in fact in some cases they will let you overtake them, so I recommend You to search for some mods on the internet in order to have competitive cars to race against. Compare to some older versions F1 2012 is pretty decent and far better than F1 2011, there is some lack when it comes to comparing to F1 2010, which had very competitive AI cars but it had too much of an understeer. Although it's still enjoyable to play with new features such as Championship mode and Season Challenge.http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1121617146http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1097143233CareerBefore You start a career you need to complete Young driver's test, It takes about 15-20 minutes after that you have been given few teams to choose between. Once you have chosen team You are given 7 seasons of career gameplay. Complete Team objectives, finishing at the top positions. beat Your Teammate and Your rival and completing R&D Objectives will help you get recognized from top tier teams. Some teams like Red Bull can recognize You faster than other teams like Mclaren or Mercedes. Race Your way to the top and beat top tier teams to win World Championship titles and Constructor's title.Season ChallengeYou choose to start a team, depends on difficulty, if you choose easy you will be able to pick any team, If you choose hard, you will start will low tier teams. In Season Challenge you pick your rivals and try to beat them in best of 3, if you score 2 wins you will get a contract from that team, if you accept contract You will replace that driver and You gonna pick next rival. Season Challenge has only 10 circuits, 10 less than career and in that time You must beat all rivals you have chosen. There is One-Shot qualifying and Race is only 5 laps long, tyre wear is not affected!Championship modeHere You need to beat 7 World Champions from recent time, Kimi, Hamilton, Button, Vettel, Alonso, and Schumacher. Once You have beaten them all in their own challenges You are going to the Ultimate race where You are going to race them all at the Austin. Choosing difficulty will impact the medal you get, e.i.

It gives penaltys to the player for minor incidents and other cars are forgiven for bumping you hard. And the pit exit of some tracks is bugged because the game gives a penalty for crossing the pit-lane line, when the car is still controlled by the AI. I have to save rewinds for that moment for not, my race is going down hard. These kind of issues are gamebreaking, at least for me, but overall i recommend the game for the fans of F1 (if they can pass over little flaws)!!!"

It appeals to the casual gamer as well. It's not arcady, but still thoroughly enjoyable.Pros:Great graphicsAwesome soundVery good ambience feelAddictive gameplayVariety of challenges in case you want a break from the Career modeCons:Could do with a lesser percentage of Race Length option - Currently, the minimum is 25% which takes around 25-30 mins for a single race to complete in Career mode. Having a 15% option wouldn't be a such a bad idea.Manual pit lane handling - AI taking control as soon as you enter the pits can be avoided as well. Perhaps having an option to turn that off/on would be greatPerhaps needs a bit more commentary during a raceI had to really think hard for the above three points (none of them gamebreaking) which to me is an indication of how much I love playing this game.

,Recommended,208500,23883087,"Posted: 27 June, 2016",all,Life Pilgrim,"What an incredible racing game and this is coming from someone who didn't appreciate F1.The graphics are pretty even by 2016's standard.At first I couldn't compete in qualifying against AI which put me in the last position consistently. Then I started to learn the tracks better and I began to improve in qualifying sessions. 19th out of 24, 18th, 7th, then eventually 1st and 2nd!! The reward feeling is incredible as you win your races.In career mode you have to also master your race strategy which means knowing which tire set to choose and when to go to pit. Temperatures of brakes and tires are simulated so if they are cold you will find yourself sliding in corners.As I started to do well in dry races, I encountered another challenge in the dynamic weather. When it gets from sunshine to rain, you need to time your pit wisely to change tire set. New tires are cold and take time to adjust to the rythm of racing so you can't just push your car mindlessly. I struggled bad when weather turns from dry to wet until I learned when to pull a pit stop and to watch out for the temperatures of both my brakes and tires.Again, this is a beautiful F1 game that's pretty with immersive sound effects. You can feel the competitiveness from the AI. Whoever coded the AI deserves a medal!Buy this even if you just have a slight interest in F1.UPDATE July 13th 2016After I bought F1 2013 which is deemed by many to be the best F1 title from Codemasters yet, I'm loving F1 2012 even more. While F1 2013 is a bit prettier than F1 2012, it suffers from water spray not being shown in replays. I often record my games and post the videos on Youtube as a personal album of sort and this water spray bug bugs me very much especially from an F1 title vaunted very much to be the best yet from Codemasters. F1 2013 AI is also much tougher and I simply cannot keep up with the AI. In races where I could get into podium in F1 2012, I must settle with 5th-6th place instead in F1 2013. Some people may like the tougher AI but not me. Thus, F1 2012 is very much the more accessible game. As for the vaunted handling of F1 2013, I found it to be an overstatement. Cars in F1 2013 may be more twitchy at slow speeds but that doesn't necessarily make them more realistic....only more difficult to control at slow speeds. High speed handling in F1 2013 is on par with F1 2012 if not slightly more arcade (easier to drive). I regret buying F1 2013 at full price in fact because of the marginal value it has over F1 2012 which I bought for very cheap. Aside from the lackluster DLCs F1 2013 has no obvious edge over F1 2012. Certainly nothing to justify buying it at full price considering Codemasters has maintained the F1 2013 at full price for 2 years without any discount whatsoever being offered.Here's a little comparison between F1 games that I own:F1 2012: Great value, great handling physics, capable but not overwhelming AI (AI is at the sweetest spot imo), a minor bug in helmet visor texture, still looks good for 2016's standard, cars have V8 engine with awesome sound and you get to race as or with Michael Schumacher (2012 is his final racing year)F1 2013: Bad value since it's not been discounted for couple years now, at slow speeds the cars are more twitchy while at higher speeds the cars feel a tiny bit more arcade than F1 2012, rather overwhelming AI that can shock new players, bug: AI water spray isn't being shown in replay, a bit prettier than F1 2012, cars have V8 engine with awesome sound though there's no longer Michael Schumacher in the game, DLCs allow you to race in 1980s and 1990s F1 cars although the track and team lists are lacking.F1 2014: Good value when discounted, handling is quite a bit more arcade compared to previous iterations and suffers from understeer, good AI that's not as overwhelming as F1 2013, bug: AI water spray isn't being shown in replay, prettier than F1 2013, all teams are unlocked from the start in career mode so you don't have to start in a low tier team, has unlimited replay option that alleviates any worry of you ruining a race due to short lapses of concentration, cars have new turbocharged V6 engine with underwhelming sound..."

The only downside to this game is the sensitivity in the steering. PLayng this game on a keyboard can be a challange at times because you have to judge perfectly the point where the apex of the corner and the time to steer into that apex; if you are too soon, you will understeer, and if you are too late, you will oversteer the corner. This sensitivity makes streemlining difficult too, because its really hard to maintain the colinear motion behind the car in front.

When it runs into you you will be punished (throttle limit for x amount of secs) despite having done nothing wrong and it continues as if nothing happened.Also I find that the rules are not applied correctly at all times, sometimes you will get no penalty for being in the grass with all fours, at other times you will get one (again limiter on throttle) while you are 100% sure that you had still one tire on the tarmac. I play in cockpit mode so I had a clear view on the front of my car at all times and I could repeat it while testing.TBH,I enjoyed '97 (PSX), '98 (PSX), 2001 (PC), 2006(PSII), and all other versions I have ever played much much more. If I had to choose between this version and 2006 on my PSII I would go for the latter (heck even 2001) any day of the week despite the graphics being dated a bit.I could suggest you try for yourself and make up your own mind and refund if needed but the game requires you to do all the tests before you get to drive races in career mode.Not sure if you will manage to get there within the two hour period as playtime included time to download and steam adds an hour (for some bizzare reason) when you go the the support section.Arcade mode is available from the start but is not representative of the 'real' game.See comments for more details about why it was not running for me at some point. ;)"

My favorite racing games are the Grand Turismo games on the Playstation consoles. I have the wheel that was designed for the 5th one on PS3. That game is awesome because I can just play it. But THIS GAME? No. Not so much. Maybe I'm just a novice, but I just can't even get past the first track on career mode. I use my wheel with this game and the cars are VERY twitchy. I've sat and tweeked the heck out of the wheel. I've gone to various forums looking for advice others have given on the best settings and tried those. And just when I thought I had the track down no less, which takes a lot of patience and time I might add, the AI just destroyed me; leaving myself wondering, ""How in the heck can I drive this much better with this game?!"" Oh and its not like I have it on Hard or anything. It's on the default AI setting. What was really sad to me was I did not notice a difference in how the cars handled when I pulled out my Xbox 360 controller to play this game. Dare I say it might make driving the cars a little easier? I don't know, but I know as much as I try to really like this game I just can't. I had more fun playing the Formula 1 games released on the first playstation. I had more fun playing the old Sierra NASCAR games on PC back in the day. You know why? It was because the controlls for the cars were easy to learn, and easy to use! The cars WEREN'T TWITCHY! Whenever I would break and then veer into a turn, I DIDN'T SPIN OUT like I do at least a few times per race in this game! This game is NOT FUN. It feels like work every time I play it. When I play a racing game, I expect to be able to just load, play, and be competitive. Not spend days and days trying to master a track only to finish in the bottom half of the pack. Screw that. Screw this game."

You do need to learn and understand the different tracks. There are still a few minor bugs which can occasionally cause you to throw a race (Abu Dhabi seems to be the standout for me) but otherwise pretty flawless. Avoiding penalties in the first lap can be hard and for the beginner intensely frustrating but with practise you can eventually avoid them. The only bugbear I have which stops me giving it a ten is the one aspect of the penalty system which penalises you if you have a collision but if some clown AI driver knocks you out they seem to get away scot free which hardly seems fair. The only way to avoid this is be really careful in the turns and stay as far away as you can from the other drivers. But apart from that it`s just a blast especially in career mode which really makes you feel a sense of achievement when you do well in a race or even better get offered a contract with a big team. Hours of fun and well worth the purchase price!

I'm currently working my way through a season on Hard/Pro. This means Hard difficulty, no assists, no racing line,♥♥♥♥♥♥pit view, up to 100% race distance (standard 25%, 5 on 50% and 3 on 100%), and most importantly, no rewinds. Pro is for the AI, not as brutal as they are on Legendary, but given I have no rewinds it seems like the right level of challenge.Each race i need to manage my fuel, tyres and race strategy and am currently running 9th on the Drivers Championship.For the Arcade fans, Season Challenge is a quick 9 or so race season that you can run on Easy difficulty and still get immersed in the sensation of racing these groundbound rocket-ships.Get it, thank me later."
