,Recommended,208600,13291396,"Posted: 8 December, 2014",all,M0RT,"Lunar Flight is a simple sim that allows you to fly an Apollo style lunar module around four different maps (difficulty varies between the maps) simulating the moon and mars environments.  It has a steep learning curve but is extremely satisfying to master.Initially it feels a bit like playing the classic 8 bit 'lunar lander' type games in 3D but there's more to it than that. Missions include carrying cargo between locations, gathering data from survey sites and recovering lost cargo.  As you progress with missions you gain XP and are able to upgrade your ship to make it more fuel efficient and more manoeuvrable.Multiplayer introduces combat, adding 'sidewinder' style missiles and decoy flares to the mix.  Combat isn't easy; changing direction can be hard due to inertia and it's a pretty unique experience."

I own about every flight and space flight simulator there is, and I must admit, this game was quite a fun experience.First, you'll have to learn about thrust vectoring, which is about the hardest thing to learn if you don't know physics. It's very long for some people and you may get desperate and begin hating this game. But once this is done, you'll understand just how fun this game is.You can carry out mission, such as locating lost equipment or transporting cargo. And yes, weight does affect your flight. There nothing more intense than landing on a platform with 0.3% left fuel because you underestiamted the weight of that cargo.And there's multiplayer : Shooting other people on the moon/mars!And the best part is : The developper (independant, as far as I know) oftens adds stuff to the game and they're awsome. When I bought the game, there were 3 maps, no multi. Since then, Mars was added, multi was added, Occulus Rift support was added and I can't wait to see what's next.A definitive buy for any flight sim enthousiast."
76561197970562429,Recommended,208600,18153933,"Posted: 22 September, 2015",all,HarryM,"A true spiritual successor to old games like Lunar Lander. Yes, there is a learning curve here. One thing that is a bit unfair is a stock lander with no upgrades lacks a stabilizer, if you get the craft rotating in mutiple axis you will have a hell of a time getting it stabilized. As you progress and upgrade the LM you won't have this problem, though of course you will have more experience flying and won't be so fazed by basic flight. Bottom line: when starting out only use yaw/rotate and leave pitch and roll alone. Mission types are fine though they boil down to fly from base X to base/point X and do something. Lost cargo is a little more interesting as you have to use your eyes to locate the target (the beacon is too short ranged to be of too much use in locating the cargo). Some other mission types would be useful, like a photo-mapping mission, where you have to fly a designated strip of territory taking images as you go along.The actual feeling of flight is superb. The Hills map in particular has a very authentic Lunar Highlands feel to it. Others less so. Canyons is challenging but the verticle exageration makes it look a little unbelievable. Mars is also a challenge but after the ""purity"" of Lunar flying is a bit frustrating.As far as this game being too difficult, well, I disagree. If you watch the basic tutorials you should be fine, esp if you obey the basic rule of ""no pitch/roll w/o a stabilizer"". If you want difficult, try Eagle Lander 3D which is a hardcore LM sim, no game, no missiles, no HUD, just the DSKY and a scribed pattern on the LM window to guide you and historical Apollo scenarios.For a niche title an impressive level of support. After the initial release we saw release of Oculus Rift support and then multiplayer, and continuing support into 2015. The developer has demonstrated maturity and staying power by supporting this very excellent sim/game."

However, I've now been able to play this game in VR (Vive) and felt compelled to update my thoughts.This game is the best VR experience I've had to date! It's easily a better VR experience that DCS which I also spend a lot of time with. Why the high praise? There are a few reasons:GOOD FRAME RATES - Perhaps due to the fact that this is a relatively simple game, framerates remain high enough to give a good experience.SMOOTH MOTION - Due to the ""floating"" nature of low-G motion, movement is smooth and predictable. It feels more like piloting a submarine than an plane at times and this smooth motion is very VR friendly allowing me to play for long stretches with absolutely no discomfort.AVATAR PRESENCE - The scale and position of the avatar is perfect. Looking down at your space suit with hands on the controls feels just right when holding your HOTAS in real life. Also, the interior of the lander is well laid out and nicely modelled. All this really adds to the sense of presence. While I mention below that a gamepad is the preferred method of control, when in VR definitely use a HOTAS if you've got it.It's not perfect and the [vr_beta] build that provides VR support still has a few bugs. The control setup is needlessly convoluted for a game that is fundamentally quite straight forward. But, if you can wrestle through the configuration, you'll be rewarded with one of the best cockpit based VR experiences available!----- ORIGINAL REVIEW -----This unassuming title delivers far more than you might expect on first glance and has become one of my all-time favourite games! Yes - it's that good!The visuals and physics are superbly done giving you a real sense of low-G flight while keeping the controls very straight-forward. However, just because the simulation is limited to basic thruster controls, don't be fooled into thinking this is a simple arcade flight model.It takes a while to master flight and get used to the fact that (unlike an aeroplane) the direction you're facing is not always the direction you're moving and that your primary thrust (assuming you're upright which frequenly you are not) is pushing you up rather than forward. Learning the art of flight and mastering precise landings is tons of fun and very addictive.It's the *feeling* of low-G flight that this game does so incredibly well! I don't have an Occulus Rift yet but it supports it and I imagine it would be nothing short of incredible! After you finish a flight, you can optionally save it and play it back which is a great feature if you've done a particularly interesting manoeuver or perhaps recovered from a minor crash.*Note: I am a long standing PC gamer and get frustrated when the control scheme of a game is compromised to support gamepads that lack the precision of a mouse. However, Lunar Flight is a notable exception to that rule. This game is best played with a controller. A joystick/HOTAS setup works well (I've tried it) as it does with any flight simulator but in this case a gamepad is definitely the best option.There are 3 lunar maps of increasing complexity and a 4th Mars map that has stronger gravity and wind storms which push you off course and obscure your vision adding a nice extra challenge.Missions are one of three varieties: Transporting cargo directly from one pad to another; surveying (hover over) an area; or searching for and returning cargo that has been lost somewhere on the surface. In addition there are time trials where you have to fly from pad to pad through a series of gates as fast as possible and you can equip missles to shoot at either unmanned drones or other players in multiplayer.Personally, I find the magic to this game is in the flying - not the shooting - and I would have been just as happy if the combat had been removed from the game entirely. The time trials never grabbed me either as I prefer to fly at my own pace. The missions are fun but extremely simplistic. After 100+ hours in the game, I fly cargo recovery exclusively as it is the most interesting of the three.In some ways the game suffers from it's sucessful flight model as it's so much fun that even once you're past the challenge of learning, you still want to keep flying around. But, the simple and limited missions mean that there just isn't enough to do.PROS:- Well executed and realistic flight/physics model.- Excellent sounds and graphics. Both are simple but very effective.- Wonderful *feel* to low-G flight.- Oculus Rift support (even though I don't have one to try yet).CONS:- Simplistic and limited missions that quickly become repetitive.- Relatively small maps. They're sufficient but would be nice if they were bigger.Mastering flight can be a challenge at first. However, the realistic physics coupled with simple controls strike a nice balance between game and ""light sim"", making it easy to pick up.It's the wonderful sensation of low-G flight keeps me coming back for quick fixes despite the repetitive missions. I highly recommend this game to anyone that has an interest in flight games."

I only wish I had an Oculus Rift to play it with, but my TrackIR does perfectly well.Ever since ""Lunar Lander"" on the ZX81 and ""Thrust"" on the Atari ST, I've loved these kinds of gravity-based vector thrust games.  This game takes it into a whole new dimension: 3D.Everything about this game is delightful: the mini tech tree to upgrade the lander, the background sounds, the retro green UI, the perfect lunar landscape rendering.  I have to hand it to Shovsoft, this game is so polished you can see your face in it.This game is for people who have EXCELLENT spacial awareness.  If you get a bit sea-sick, or can't read a map upside down, go elsewhere.   This is the sort of game where you have to be upside down, spinning, while flying in a parabolic arc, trying to calculate thrust vectors to slow you down and cancel rotation before you become a lunar smear.I absolutely love the sense of ""being there"", especially with the head-tracking, and in-ear microphones.  Sitting with the lights off, listening to the NASA commentary and carrying cargo around, I'm in hog heaven.I really REALLY hope that there's a sequel to this which goes in the direction that HardWar (or SubCulture) took.

No tweaking necessary, only minor customization for Xbox controls to suit your own preferences. Second, it rarely gives motion sickness, as long as you avoid spiraling out of control! This is the perfect game for people new to the Rift and should come bundled with the consumer version when it is out, IMHO. It is my go-to game to ""get my Rift legs back"" from a period of inactivity.The physics are spot on. The Xbox 360 controls and in-cockpit controls/HUD are the best implementation I've seen. It takes a few tries but once you get the hang of them everything is intuitive, and it doesn't take long. But for the fact I am sitting in Earth's gravity, I would think I was actully flying around on the moon retrieving lost cargo. And shooting missiles at my competition in online multiplayer. It is a relaxing and serene experience.If you have enough money to buy a Rift, you have enough money to buy this game. You owe it to yourself, the community, and the developer to give it a try! Otherwise, you are missing an out-of-this-world experience!I cannot give this ""game"" enough praise. It is more of an experience than a game!The non-VR version is probably also good (and higher resolution) but the VR version is so good I don't want to stop.

One of the best VR games out there, even though not made for VR originally and steam VR support still in beta.I'm not sure how I could miss this game for so long - maybe because I was scared off by its presumed age, or because the logo didn't look ""serious"" or whatever. Could not have been more pleased with this discovery. It's a very ""physical"" game - all about putting you in control of a low-gravity vehicle on the moon (and later on mars), you control thrusters in all directions (main thrust for up/down, side thrusters for left/right/forward/back movement, and combined thruster control for all 3 rotational axes, i.e. pitch/roll/yaw). Initially the whole thing seems totally overwhelming and uncontrollable, but it's amazing how you develop a better and better sense for it after a few hours of play.Graphics seem better to me than most VR games out there currently. Sound is amazing - chill space tunes, convincing engine and warning sounds, NASA radio recordings in the background for extra ambience. The HUD appears big and simple (probably because it's scaled up for VR), but is extremely functional. I didn't read the manual and only watched a single tutorial video, but could figure out what all the indicators meant relatively quickly (my limited flight sim experience probably helped though). Note that this isn't a serious simulator though - it's very much focused on the flight/thruster control mechanics; there are no systems to manage or anything of the sort.Only real downside is the limited content - three types of simple missions; four maps total (with the same missions); there are ~50 achievements but they're not that hard to get either. Using your in-game credits earned from completing missions, you can also purchase up to 12 upgrades for your moon lander to improve its performance and handling, but that's it. Apparently there is some kind of multiplayer/deathmatch mode as well, but that's not yet supported in VR so I haven't tried it. I prefer non-combat anyways. I'd love to see more mission variety, maybe a campaign even, and/or more challenging achievements. Coop multiplayer would be amazing too :) Also can't wait for replays to work in VR.Even for what it is though, I found the price absolutely fair. I think you too might like this if some or all of these points may apply to you:- you like space- you like flight sims- you enjoy docking in elite dangerous- your favorite part in euro/american truck simulator is backing up and parking your trailerThanks to the dev for this amazing piece of software!"

The creator seems to think it's more on the arcade-ish side, but I think the flight model is complex enough to make most people think ""simulator"". You will have to think about when and how to turn to gain right kind of velocity, when to start braking in time and other things like that. I would also recommending using an analog control of some kind. Keyboard is too clunky. Personally I'm using a joystick. I guess the most arcadey thing might be the missiles that were added later. Probably to make the multiplayer have some point. I just ignore that and fly around doing missions. Very relaxing. There's also a simple level up system for buying better thrust, gyros to kill your spin and such.It had been said that this is one of the best early Oculus Rift games. I wouldn't know about that, but the virtual cockpit is enjoyable enough with just headrtracking (I'm using EDTracker with FreeTrack)."

This game is exactly what it says it is - a modern take on landing little spider like ships on the moon. Except now it's in 3D and in VR, and not just any VR but GOOD VR. This game has got that VR ""presence"" that convinces you that you're sitting in a space ship flying over the moon. The bubble canopy of the ship gives you a great view as you coast low and slow over the moon. It made me feel like an astronaut and that's what VR's all about.This game might not have been natively VR but it sure looks and feels like it was. It's good purchase for that alone.The game itself surprised me since it's basically a sim version of the arcade game. It's not Kerbal Space Program but the flight model is way beyond Elite Dangerous (for lots of different reasons, mind you.) It's newtonian with 6DOF, which means you can get into serious trouble as you realize you're coming in too fast for a landing or that little bit of yaw you were ignoring has crept up and turned you sideways. Leaning to fly takes a little bit of patience and you should expect to crash.But once you get the hang of it and start completing missions, something clicks and you start pitching over for max thrust and pitching 180 to counter it, mindful that gravity is always pulling you down, mind you. It's never a set-it-and-forget it sim. You have to be on top of every bit of momentum and inertia that builds or it's crater time. But again, with the VR implementation, it feels like mastering the physics of space flight rather than a chore.I've only got a couple hours in but I'm loving it. I've found a game controller is the best way to fly for me. I have a HOTAS setup, but having a twin stick controller is just perfect for the thrusters and the triggers for the descent engine.So, it's a fun little sim that's been upgraded to a great VR game. Bear in mind that at the time of this review Vive support is beta, but so far I've had no problems other than the gaze-style selection system really makes you twist your neck to hit some of the controls on the side panels."

I orginally bought this years ago, it's only gotten better with VR. Without VR and/or experience, I don't recommend using pitch and roll controls, just use the RCS thrusters for lateral movement and the main engine for up/down. Otherwise, you're likely to simply fly out of control and crash often. The game takes some time to fly by feel, until then use all of the navigation aids and watch your velocities.In VR the cockpit has been reworked to support a 'look-cursor' for clicking on buttons and switches. The sizes are good, making them easy to use. The control setup for joystick/throttle has been reworked and is now much easier to use. I have an X-55 Rhino, and was able to get it setup perfectly with the new interface.The only criticisim I have is that it would be really nice to see it expanded, like bases that are way out of visual range and more mission types. In the end, this game is one that you will love to put time into, but it will feel repeitive and you'll want to move onto something else after a few hours. It's so well done that it's easy to come back and check out updates to see what has been changed and run through a few more cargo deliveries."

Playing with an xbox controller, headphones and TrackIR - I forgot I was at home and not in a little cargo carryin space mobile.  I've blown through multiple hours in a day, gliding over the moon (and mars) while listening to the wonderfully ambient soundtrack and the chatter from astronauts.Missions vary from Cargo hauling which involves cargos of various weights and require different techniques to manage your fuel properly, to Data Scanning and Lost Cargo missions where you need to explore in a general area to find a lost cargo container. There are also Time Trials, where you fly a predefined course from one base to another in as fast as time as possible.  I cannot speak for the multiplayer, I see no active servers.  I would be interrested in giving it a go though if I could find someone to play it with.As you progress, you'll gain money and XP.  Use both to upgrade your little ship.  There's 4 components to upgrade, with 3 levels of upgrades for each module available.  First flight will be bad, but stick with it.  Once you learn the physics and techniques needed to fly and your brain associates all the HUD elements to what t he ship is doing, it becomes quite easy and you'll soon find yourself pulling advanced maneuvers while sailing over the moon.I highly recommend this game if you're interrested in actual space flight, or games like Kerbal Space Program.  You're going to need an hour or 2 of dedicated time to acclimate yourself to the controlls / feel of the ship but it's highly rewarding once you do.  Check it out!!"

The cockpit looks fantastic, there's a good sense of scale - nothing seems too big or too small - and interacting with all the cockpit buttons (instead of requiring the keyboard / having a floating hud full of buttons) works really well.As for the game itself, the physics handles... well, like it should:  Gravity pulls you down, you've got your velocity vector to manage, and then there's the actual crafts rotation to consider - all under the no-air-resistance-because-we're-in-space environment where any force you apply you have to counteract yourself.  There's the additional problem of cargo (if you're doing transporting/finding lost cargo missions) - cargo adds weight to your craft, affecting the thrust-to-weight ratio and thus making the craft less manoeuvrable.The sense of scale and depth that the Oculus Rift provides adds a whole new dimension (ha) to the game, which I feel likely makes it easier to fly your craft as you have a better grasp of where you are in the 3d-space, and it also of course makes the game a lot more immersive.

However, some months ago I had a brainwave and went back to configure it differently... Instead of assigning joystick to roll, pitch axis as you would a regular flight sim... I assigned the joystick x axis to thrust sideways left and right respectively. Joystick Y axis assigned to thrust forward and back. Throttle controls main engine for Y axis travel.  Thus with x52 pro I am able to maintain level flight and in addition the yaw is controlled by joystick yaw axis (twist of stick).I like this sim a lot.  I like the graphics... I like the non arcade nature and realism of flying moon or mars based missions to transport cargo or recover things.  Haven't tried multiplayer yet but I guess that will be fun since u have rockets and flares.I recently purchased Oculus DK2 and was amazed to find Lunar Flight is an incredible experience... Incredible because the developer of this sim has created an amazingly realistic experience through oculus.  You sit in your fully 3d cockpit and can control the instrument screens by looking at them and hitting activate button.  Everything is life size and in stereoscopic 3d with oculus and with Lunar Flight it just looks mind-blowing.I use runtime 6.0.1 and in direct mode for this sim.If you own Oculus... buy Lunar Flight.  If you don't own Oculus.. Buy the CV1 when it launches in Q1 2016."

In Lunar Flight, the simulation is realistic, it respects the laws of Newton and it gives you the feeling of driving the real lander.It takes time to get aquanted to the controls and the most difficult part perhaps is to get trained on yaw, pitch and roll, i.e. the real attitude. You can progress a lot without using YPR commands, but the most rewarding part comes when you manage those controls.The graphic part is accurate: light, dust, shadows are just ok and on a recent PC it flows quite smoothly. The soundtrack is really good: it is an ambient track which fits the deepness of the moon environment, in which everithing else is silent. Always on audio, the flight controllers dialogues are a bit repetitive and once you got the main dialogue it's a bit boring hearing over and over.Ok, I don't know if in a future in which the man could be on the Moon the best vehichle to use would be a Lander like the one in Lunar Flight,  which is almost the same of 1969-1973 Apollo Missions. Anyway, especially with the 3D environment, the simulation is really immersive. I also suppose that the Oculus Rift port will be amazing.Concerning single player, the major missions are  transport, cargo rescue and going from A->B. Some cargo rescue missions are quite difficult and be sure to have additional tank of fuel with you. Additional missions typology other than could be beneficial to the longevity. I personally don't care too much about multiplayer on this game.The upgrade system is normal: make money with missions, upgrade tools and so on, but IMO it does not really drive the game/story.Something I really miss is a Linux porting: I'd like to be able to play it also on that platform.In synthesis, I definitely recommend this game if you are a passionate about astronautics and have the patience to learn how to control the lander, which is not immediate."

This game ""Lunar Flight"" takes that idea and converts over to 3D.The game is an excellent 3D landing simulator with superb physics simulation that allows for all angles of camera view and multi split screening for precise landing and threat analysis.  The game is a great progression from that old classic with added multiplayer support, weapon systems that also include counter-measures, and now has ""Oculus Rift"" Integration as well.  You can control x,y,z axis' and spin of your craft as well as angle and speed of the module.

It reminds a bit how you are flying the helis in FSXSome points I regret however, and I figured out after browsing the discussion threads that they were design choices, concern the way the XBOX controller is handled and has to be configured, and the weaponnery.In short, the controller is seen either as an Xinput controller, in which case you cannot change any setting, or as a Direct input controller, which you can configure, but unfortunately it does not receive a default configuration. So it's a bit of a hassle to set this up, given also that the game documentation does not state these subtleties.Also, the game controller in Direct input need to be up before starting the game, otherwise it is not detected (and you need to go in deep settings menus to have it redetected), this is also a design choice, but you have to figure this out... Not so noobs friendly...A bit confusing also is that weapons are still present even if you choose the No combat mode, and your XBOX controller will fire those in Xinput mode... no way to change this, unless going to Direct input mode, and again, documentation not in line with this constraint, so it takes a bit of time to figure this out also. Given also that weaponnery is only used for multiplayer combat mode, this design choice is pretty awkward too.But hopefully, the gameplay is pretty fantastic if you like flying in simulators, and enjoy the peacefulness of this moon atmosphereDefinitely worth trying, and investing some patience to go through the beginners pitfalls, after that, it becomes a great enjoyment to play with, especially using your instruments like in IFR flights!"

It was good playing just on computer monitor before, but it so much better suited for VR. I would give it 10/10 for Oculus Rift and perhaps 8/10 on monitor only. I'm playing with XBOX 360 controller on Win 7 64-bit PC and GTX 1070. Everything is smooth as buttter and works perfectly."

The experience of sitting in the cockpit and the panic as you realize that your lander is hurtling towards something that you might not have enough time and thrust to avoid makes the game immersive, and the view from the cockpit can be awe inspiring at times (especially from high up).On top of that there is still motion on the part of the devs on the forum and they intend to bring the VR experience out of beta despite so much time passing since its release.This is a great experience for more constrained VR setups where you have only the headset and controller/mouse and keyboard in a sitting position. Steam reports it as not being controller supported when you launch it but it actually is."

76561198006982430,Recommended,208600,2413665,"Posted: 16 March, 2013",all,BadKarma048,"I really liked this game.  Flying around in near zero gravity can be challenging but also a lot of fun.  It's like the old Lunar Lander game on steroids.   Or if you're familiar with the game Moonbase Alpha then cross that with MS Flight Simulator and you've got Lunar Flight.  It has a moderate learning curve but with some practice I was able to complete most missions on the first try.  At first I just tried to wing it but had very little success.  So, watching the 10 training videos is a must or you'll likely have a very difficult time.  The Mars map is very challenging and can be pretty difficult if your Lunar Lander isn't fully upgraded."

Brilliant game, really, really works wellwith the XBOX ONE controller. Yes, controlling the craft is is extremely difficult at first, but stick with it and you will berewarded. Youtube has a great tutorial by the author of the game because when you load the game for the first time,its a little hard to figure out what you do first.Again, stick with it, you slowly get better at flying the module and thus successfuly completing the missions. I'm hooked!"
,Recommended,208600,836658,"Posted: 4 January, 2013",all,Dr. Strangelove,"First, I know this game was made by one lone developer that has done an excellent job. Lunar Flight is enjoyable, has a really great atmosphere and provides a great learning curve.Still,it's a good game with some limiting factors. The biggest being it gets very repetitive quickly. This game really needs to have more content added, or be opened up to the community (eg: Level / mission editing / mods / open world). Combat system is lacking as well, I would much rather see it scrapped in favor of more mission variety."
