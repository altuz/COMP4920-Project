Avoid Mumbo Jumbo and play one of the many other HOGs out there.
,Not Recommended,208620,14459904,"Posted: 14 February, 2015",all,Leonia,"EDIT: As of Feburary 18, 2015, GamerByDay has managed to restore the achievements the game had to begin with, but I still cannot recommend that you buy this game or support Mumbo Jumbo until the issue is fully fixed.Frankly, the fact that it took almost a whole year - from March 2014 when people began reporting issues about the broken achievements to February 2015 - for this issue to be fixed is rather baffling, to say the least. Not helping Mumbo Jumbo's case is their lack of action to fix the problem when it first came up, and things only went downhill after they deleted the achievements and (initially) refused to restore them. It should also be noted that two other Midnight Mystery games (Devil on the Mississippi, Haunted Houdini) had the same update process as Salem at the same time, so why Salem was broken and why Mumbo Jumbo didn't bother to fix it before things got out of hand is, again, baffling.I'd keep a wary eye on Mumbo Jumbo and their games and check the forums to see what's going on before you give them any money. You are free to read the original review below.ORIGINAL REVIEW FROM FEB. 14, 2015:I cannot, under any circumstances, recommend this game. Additionally, I cannot recommend purchasing any games from Mumbo Jumbo. I'd advise to stay FAR away from Mumbo Jumbo after they removed the achievements from this game, a feature that was the incentive for me to purchase via Steam rather than, say, Amazon or some other digital storefront.MumboJumbo is too lazy to fix this game, in particular, and rather than put in the effort to listen to customer feedback and implement fixes for what they broke to begin with, they would rather REMOVE features and further break their games. I have noticed whenever they updated their games on Steam, there are no notes or documentations on what was done to warrant the update.I would only follow Mumbo Jumbo just to make sure if they bring any more games to Steam I can be sure to avoid Mumbo Jumbo's games like the plague."

The puzzles didn't feel as connected, and the hidden objects were completely uninvolved with the story.  In the EAP one, they felt meaningful to the story, and you would use objects found, to find other objects.  it was cool.  This one has you find a bunch of objects, and then seemingly unrelated, find one more object that was there the whole time -- you just couldn't click on it.  The game was more complex, and the puzzles were obtuse -- I even was forced to use a walkthrough for a couple parts, as the hint system is insane.  You have like thirty objects in your inventory, and the hint system demands you get a hint on one object....I come down on it, because I really liked the first one, and hoped they would continue with that style.  Maybe the next one will be better."

Of course, you can always use the hints you've accumulated, but overreliance on these defeats the purpose. As it was, I had to fall back on them more than once after bouncing futilely back and forth between every area of the game trying to figure out what I was supposed to do next. Still, if you get it cheap, it's a decent experience."

76561198065438663,Recommended,208620,9000147,"Posted: 6 February, 2014",all,ravencorbie,"I enjoyed playing this game.  I played through all of Story Mode.  As someone who is new to this type of game, one feature I wish had been included was some way to have hints for the puzzles.  Sometimes, I got very stuck and my only options were to either go online to find out the solution or to ""skip"", which did not allow me to learn how to solve the puzzle.  The downside was that in looking online, I got the whole solution, when I would have preferred just getting a starting hint of some kind.  And there was one puzzle where the solution I found online did not work.  It was a puzzle where you have to slide books out of the way so that a particular one can get to a particular spot.  The opening arrangement in my game was different than the opening arrangement I found on the website.  That said, overall, I did enjoy the game.  The story was not quite as rich as the previous game (it was longer, certainly, but not as well-connected), but it was still immersive, and I enjoyed seeing how the different charcters and puzzles interacted with the main plot.  I'm looking forward to trying out the third game!"
,Recommended,208620,10937454,"Posted: 29 June, 2014",all,Flying Omelette,"This is a big step up from the Edgar Allan Poe Conspiracy, being much more involved in the puzzle-solving aspect. Like most Casual Hidden Object Games, you have to limit yourself when it comes to using hints and skipping puzzles to get a fuller, longer, and more challenging experience. Only recommended to those who like hidden object games and if you buy it in a bundle with the other three Midnight Mysteries. I don't know much about Nathaniel Hawthorne, so I can't comment too much on the story, but I imagine it's just as ""revisionist"" as the Poe and Mark Twain games. Final caveat: As of writing this review, the Steam Achievements are broken. They update to the in-game Trophy Room, but not to Steam.Rating: 3/5"

,Not Recommended,208620,7460606,"Posted: 23 October, 2013",all,BridgetFisher,This mystery games suffers from some lack of direction.  Most of these are great in the Midnight Mystery series but this one has parts that lead to nothing.  Scripted events that take place at certain locations means sometimes wandering all over to find that next event to randomly occur so you can proceed. It is not a mystery that can be solved when these are random events instead of puzzles its just wandering around aimlessly.Rating:  2/10  Value:  $0.99
,Recommended,208620,7949784,"Posted: 7 December, 2013",all,Usagi,"If you enjoy hidden item games then I do recommend this one, however, I also recommend you play all four in the series in order. Each game is an experience and unique in its own way.This one is a big step forward from the first Midnight Mysteries but also a few steps back. Nice graphics, better interface, achievements and hidden things to find and do...all great. The story however is a bit all over the place and seems to lack direction. And this can lead to aimless wandering at certain points. Also, some puzzles give you little to no clue on what you need to do next.Flaws aside, the game is worth playing. I wouldn't buy it alone though, you should buy the Midnight Mysteries bundle and enjoy them all."

Perfect pair!Its time to step in the town of Salem and find out the truth behind old spirits death and witch trials.If you are a fan of point and click adventures, this is a game for you. I personally find them fascinating, but too many times these games are filled with boring story or irritating illogical puzzles. No more!The game is very simple and instructs you well how to play. It also provides help if needed but doesnt overdo this!There hasnt been a single puzzle that would have irritated me, ive found them all enjoyable and revarding. Also games story is a neat!Harcore adventurers may find this game a maybe little too easy, but if you love Point and click adventures or are new in the genre, this game is for you!"
,Recommended,208620,74543,"Posted: 5 November, 2012",all,Toxic League,"Midnight Mysteries 2 builds upon the basic foundation of the original game and adds innovation. The game offers an interesting story, more interaction, more animations, more puzzles, and less eye spy elements. It almost feels like playing a point-and-click adventure. For an eye spy game, I thought it was decent."
,Recommended,208620,13612961,"Posted: 26 December, 2014",all,Lady Nyra,"Out of all the series, I enjoyed this one the most.  It felt almost open, and I didn't feel that I was being herded into a linear path (although of course I was!).  It was an interesting look at history and I liked the whole rescuing souls from eternal torment aspect!  There was a good story line and game play felt engaging enough that when I realised only 4 hours had passed I was like huh.  I thought I was playing longing because the game whirled me away into it.Enough HO puzzles as well as some others thrown in for good measure.  Not too easy to solve, but not hit your head on the wall difficult either.Very enjoyable!"
76561198045208825,Recommended,208620,5115981,"Posted: 15 July, 2012",all,Shatiz,"This'll serve as a recommendation for all the Midnight Mysteries. It's a find object type of puzzle game. The first Midnight Mystery had quite a few problems with objects being placed unlogically (statues up in trees etc) and objects not really corresponding to thier real size (coins being larger than a head etc) which made it quite frustrating to play. This was fixed in MM2 and remained so for the rest of the series. The other 3 games also added more of the ""use items"" type of puzzle game style as well as some more interesting puzzles to solve.Play if you like object finding puzzle games."
,Recommended,208620,10268122,"Posted: 28 May, 2014",all,netsentry,"Fun way to spend a few point-and-click hours.  It's a challenging test of eye sight and depth perception.  WIth that said, the resolution maxes at 1024, which is unfortunate, and the steam achievements don't appear to work (this is echoed by many on the game's hub).  Worth a few bucks overal."
76561197993919579,Recommended,208620,11199466,"Posted: 12 July, 2014",all,notepad,"The Midnight Mysteries series contains some of my favorite hidden object games.  These are the more typical hybrid type games, that have some adventure elements (puzzles, moving between locations, talking to people) as opposed to the find-objects-only style.Midnight Mysteries are interesting in that they are based on real historical events, then add some fictional what-ifs to fill in blanks or give alternate explanations for known events.  As a result, not only are the fun as a game but they spark some interest in reading about the real events on Wikipedia.MM2, about the Salem Witch Trials, tells of the horrible way that people were treated for not fitting in or being a little different."

,Recommended,208620,523667,"Posted: 22 April, 2013",all,Vic=HKC=,"It's now Hawthorne, another writer, that asks you to investigate his death and the Salem Witch Trials that may be the beginning of his family's curse. Will you find why he was cursed?While the story relies a lot on History, the plot is hard to follow, like in the first game. I mean, another writer asks you for peace, you're focusing on his death and asking people around but you're mainly thrown into the Salem Witch Trials and the condamnation of an innocent soul, because of his ancestor. There are also bonus scenes from Oz and Alice in Wonderland if you find the right items.But the puzzles are finally more challenging, the game is more an adventure one than HOG and you have some quite scary moments. Objects are still hard to find but the additionnal bonus are quite refreshing - not only you have still ravens to find but lucky charms too.The graphics are good, when you're not discussing with ghosts during the night, you're thrown into a cold setting, when your friend died.The only problem is that they added achievements but only in beta and you need to make some manipulation before being able to unlock them. I think it never was pushed on an official update.At least, this game is better than Edgar Allen Poe Conspiracy, more challenging and perhaps more structured in the plot. It's probably the game that makes more sense in the series anyway."
76561198173457771,Recommended,208620,32761207,Posted: 25 June,all,moon2stars,I enjoyed this one despite the achievements not working.  The graphics were nice.  The story was decent.  I liked that it had more puzzles and less hidden objects screens than the first game of the series.  I also liked that there was bonus content available.  I would not pay full price but would recommend if on sale.
