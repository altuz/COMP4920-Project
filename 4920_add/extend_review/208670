Donut,"Disclaimer: I'm only 2 hours into the game so far (3rd 'world').Blades of Time was something I picked up on a lark while it was on sale. The fact that it was from the people who made X-Blades (never played, but it looks really fanservicey) and checking a few reviews made it seem mediocre.I was wrong. This game is wonderful.Don't get me wrong, it is flawed. Graphics aren't great and the controls aren't as tight as you'd want in a 3rd person platform/hack and slash game but the core mechanics: adding powers to your character, the combat combo system, ranged combat and melee combat all feel great. The real shining point, however, is the time manipulation.In games like Prince of Persia, you rewind time to recover from mistakes. Here, you rewind time, which locks you in place and rewinds everything ELSE in the world. Then, there are two copies of you running around. Your former self just continues to do whatever it was that you did at that time, and enemies AI kicks back in.An example of this is if you wanted, you could copy yourself a bunch and all have them aim rifles, shooting at a tree. Then make a final copy which kites the bad guy over to where the shots are happening. It's unlikely that you'd need to do this, but it's possible!Anyway if you see this game on sale, grab it. It's not going to push the boundries of PC gaming, gaming or even your expectations of games, but it will provide you a solid amount of *fun*."

Yes, the game is genrally  mediocre, but the graphics aren't bad, the voice acting is okay (Ayumi is voiced by the same woman who voiced Cassandra Pentaghast, so show a little respect, you peasants. :D ), i encountered one glitch, namely the rifle just wouldn't reload for whatever reason and the gameplay is fine, fast paced and the fighting often is no cakewalk, especially on Hard. I'm playing with mouse and keyboard and it works just peachy for me.So what? The game is hard? That your problem with it? Is it that it's not a masterpiece of gaming craftsmanship? Do people forget that you can abuse the hell out of the time rewind feature and lose fights all the time?Anyway, i'm enjoying it for what it is. Certainly not the second coming of christ but it sure as hell is not a bad game or in any way unplayable. If you're into Hack & Slash this is a solid game to pick up. If you're in doubt just wait for a sale. I for one do not feel like i wasted my time or money here.I haven't played the DLC yet, so i'll shut up about it. But i'll certainly be playing through it."

Grab a PS3/360 controller and for one afternoon you can rewind time and hack things to bit without worrying about complex item systems or perfect skill trees.I found the protagonist's monologues somewhat interesting. She feels human and you can tell what she's thinking makes sense. The voice acting is a bit of a miss but it's not unbearable.It's just corridors filled with enemies and some pretty basic fights but hey, simple action game, that's what you get. Grab it under $10 if you like the genre and you'll be pleasantly surprised.DLC isn't really worth it though, just an extra mission without the neat mechanics that lasts under an hour."

Hitting the same enemies for hours.-Terrible ""puzzles"" as well as terrible platforming that doesn't work like it should.-Aim-assist on controller screws you over more than it helps.-Lackluster multiplayer that had huge lag issues in my experience.The good:-When the gameplay works it's decently fun. Too bad that isn't the case most of the time.-The time rewind mechanic works pretty well and is rather fun, however is sadly underutilized and mostly just server to press buttons simultaneously or walk through a door while your other copy opens it.Stay away from. There is a lot of better games in this genre that deserve your attention more. Even though it's a budget title there is just nothing here that warrants a buy."

I'm also rather partial to the world, music and character design, borrowed as they might be.Voice acting and plot are entirely disposable, of course, but you can't win them all, andBlades of Timedoes plenty right to outweigh those minor cons; textbook definition of a hidden gem if there ever was one."

I beat the main campaign within seven hours and the dlc in 45 minutesA couple times I encountered bugs where the AI script wouldn't run and I could not progress through a door and I had to quit and come back into the game which was a minor inconvienance but it autosaves quite frequently so I ended up losing maybe a few minutes.Twice my controls 'siezed up' I guess is what I would call it. My controls would no longer work and I had to completely alt-f4 then reload the game back up.I breezed through the bosses, I was playing on normal and now that I have hard mode unlocked I assume It will get more challenging.All in all I would definitely reccomend this game, but not at full price. There just isn't enough content to justify paying the full amount, especially for the DLC which is less than an hour long. I had a solid experience though and I'm glad I decided to finish it."

The story is, shall we say ""lacking"".  The cutscenes and gameplay graphics are fine, but everything in this game feels like it was stretched vertically... like a widescreen film that was squeezed to fit a standard frame.  I haven't played the game for long, but combat so far is not very challenging.  It was entertaining at first, but the main character narrates her surrounding and the action as it happens.  She literally will NOT SHUT UP (I got that JarJar Binks feeling).  The environment is quarky too.  The game relies on a series of doors and semi-transparent walls to steer you in whatever direction it needs you to go, then back again.  I was expecting more from this game, but given the price I paid, I really can't complain.  This is a good start to a cool concept, but it still needs a lot of work."

The rewinding mechanics allows you to work with your clone(s) to finish off enemies and bosses or solve puzzles. The puzzle aspect doesn't really fit the game, but hey, it works I guess. Think 'standing on switches' and things like that.Then there's the weapon and ability upgrading which is pretty extensive.The graphics are pretty good; I was actually surprised by how good it looked in motion. Your main character looks great (but forgettable), with the ponytails and all (woohoo, <3 ponytails !). The voice acting, however, is a bit cheesy. Mmyeah, that was to be expected I guess.But since I'm not really into the mindless action these games offer (I do enjoy them from time to time) I stopped before finishing it. No, I'm not ashamed of it. It's just not my cup of tea.In the end Blades Of Time turned out to be a very decent game, so if you're into God Of War(-like games) you might enjoy it.[Rating: 70/100]"

The fighting mechanics are some of the best I've seen since Batman: Arkham Asylum and Arkham City.  It VERY smoothly integrates First Person shooting with real-time, in-your-face, combat.  It's quite addicting, actually.  The coolest part of the game, though, is the ""Time Rewind"" feature.  They integrate this with the combat so flawlessly that it adds SO much possibility to the way you can go about killing monsters!  Basically, you rewind time from the actions you just performed, and you create clones that re-enact what you just did...meanwhile, your real self can do different actions - and then you can rewind time again and have multiple clones doing multiple actions, and it's just a big cycle!  Sometimes, it's necessary to use this feature to kill monsters, too, which is really neat.  It forces you to learn how to use the tool, and I'm glad it did!

There are a lot of different attacks and moves so playing the demo is not intuitive. In the full game the skills are introduced gradually so by the end you are fluidly carving your way through hoards of enemies with swords, guns, magic and time travel as if it was the most natural thing in the world. You unlock weapons and charms throughout story and outbreak modes to modify these skills. The levels and enemies are well designed but it is the combat which is the jewel in the crown. This is probably best game I played in the past 6 months or so. On the down side there is a very nasty bug in the flying sections that can screw up your controls and be extremely frustrating. I can't finish this review without mentioning Ayumi's breasts. I can only assume the designer had heard a description of breasts but never actually seen any. If this is the case then the erratically jiggling party hats she has on her chest are a creditable effort."

You aren't very good developers so don't overface yourself. I wanted a range of cool weapons and attacks and spells and instead you wasted all your time and effort making a massively overambitious dynamic world which slows down and kills the experience. As soon as I got to the desert I was done. ♥♥♥♥ dashing to shade after a fight when you have no health and dying repeatedly... BOOOORING! also the rewind time is too much effort.

Voice acting, ugly particle effects everywhere, and having an invincible enemy chase you randomly. But the biggest offender is how repetitive the gameplay is. Shoot at a barrier that's protecting the enemy, rewind a couple times until it breaks, now you can kill him, now every other enemy has a barrier.

It delivers much more.Although it has two difficulties, the game will adjust in subtle ways after loading from a save game, slowly increasing until it gives you a distinct advantage, however never feeling like it's belittleing you, just that the game is trying to keep the flow going.It borrows an element from Prince of Persia, allowing you to rewind time, however this creates ""clones"" of your actions, with the only limit being how many clones your computer can render until it crashes. There is something deeply satisfying about seeing a boss drop from full health to no health in a second or two thats not found elsewhere that I know of.One last tidbit. This has to be the only game I've played (at least to memory) where as the female lead gets further into the game her clothes get less revealing, whilst still giving off a sexy vibe."

,Recommended,208670,21888226,"Posted: 17 March, 2016",all,JohnGalt,"It's no masterpiece like Devil May Cry or Metal Gear Rising, but it is still one of the better hack n slash games out there. The time manipulation mechanic is well implemented, it's not just for solving puzzles but can be useful in combat as it allows you to create multiple clones of yourself. Another good thing about this game is how it handles firearms, most hack n slash games that feature guns rely too heavily on auto-aiming while this game treats guns how any good 3rd person shooter would. Some of the dialogue feels a bit ""out of place"", but overall this is a great title and you should definetly give this one a try if you enjoy these types of games."
