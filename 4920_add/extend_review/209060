All of the AboveI have had serious fun with this game since early testing copies were sent out. The alpha builds that I have played have shown so much effort put into improving the experience for everybody. I am seriously psyched to see where the full version of this game leads one of Dejobaan's finest works from these early builds.

,Not Recommended,209060,9190814,"Posted: 20 February, 2014",all,Kana,"I'm afraid i can't in the least bit recommend this game. I so wanted to love it, and it seriously looked amazing on the trailers.It had such promise, and it manages to cash in pretty much none of that. There's no feeling of bullet hell of any sort, outside of the gun you're firing when it's actually powered up. You don't need to even concider dodging bullets or beams, because the game's bosses, titans, are actually extremely brittle, and it's trivial to shoot out their weapons in an instant, leaving them as little more than static pieces of scenery.The only threat in the game comes from the seemingly infinitely spawning random little drone enemies, as well as an indescribably silly decision to put in a time limit.The game looks great, the bosses look great, so much so, that i'm very sure 80% of the development time went for polishing the graphic quality, at the cost of such small, to them, seemingly less important concepts like gameplay, entertainment, or challenge. The intro song to the game is actually far more entertaining than the game itself, and i think whoever wrote that has a great career ahead of them.It tells a great deal, that after 15 levels during the writing of this, the leaderboards have only 10 entries, where in the beginning, there were hundreds. The vast majority of people grew bored of the game in less than an hour. With that being said, i can't understand why there are so many positive reviews of it... One citing especially how it has improved over time. I would not have wanted to see the earlier revisions, then.The creation of your own arena and boss would be an extremely interesting thing, and it was the main draw in the game for me... sadly, however, there's little to no enjoyment in the game, so there's little to no point in taking the effort of creating anything for it.On a personal note, the vast majority of the game's in-level music is also awful, but it is easy to turn it off. I shouldn't need to do that, however. The music in the trailers are, outside of the theme song, the sole good tracks in the game. The rest are the worst of the worst kind of dubstep.PS. I think the game would be far, far, far more interesting, if the health pools of the bosses were 10x the value of all parts combined, and you could not shoot off parts. The decision not to do a unified health system, but allow the players to completely make the bosses harmless baffles me to no end."
,Recommended,209060,13010447,"Posted: 19 November, 2014",all,ownosourus,"Drunken Robot Pornography has a unique concept to go along with its memorable title. You take control of Reuben Mastumoto, who is having a real bad day. He accidentally made his robot bartender, Tim, self-aware and presumably being slightly freaked out by this, Tim burned down Reuben's bar and stole all the other robot staff members.Now Reuben has to defend Boston from Tim and the awesome titans he's created from the former bar staff. The premise of Drunken Robot Pornography is absurd but it's the basis of a solid game that blends the massive bosses of a bullet-hell shmup and the tight first-person shooter arenas of something like Quake III.The levels are broken out into individual, self-contained challenges. It’s a first-person shooter and you have a jetpack, and each stage is a multi-tiered jungle gym in which you bounce around and blast away at endless waves of enemies. It doesn’t take long after you begin the stage for the boss, always in the form of a giant, menacing robot, to appear and the real fight to begin. While there’s technically a story in DRP, it mostly hangs in your periphery as you focus on mastering the mechanics of the movement and combat.Completing each stage is not as straight-forward as simply staying alive long enough to deplete the boss’s health. The stages are timed so you also have to be swift in carrying out your attack, which is tough when you’re constantly on the move, avoiding enemy fire and chasing power-ups.While the premise of DRP is interesting and the gameplay challenging, I felt the level design left a lot to be desired. It’s frustrating to be constantly fighting the controls, not because they’re bad, but because your attention is split between maneuvering around the stage and shooting stuff. Also, the bosses themselves are somewhat cookie-cutter, at least in function, so sometimes it can get repetitive.The giant robot bosses look really cool, though, and you can tell the developers put a lot of work into the visual presentation of them.DRP follows a fortunate trend in the indie game scene and boasts an interesting visual style and an electric soundtrack. It’s certainly fun to look at, and the array of electronic beats suit the style of the game perfectly.Comic relief comes from a robot partner who you never see but is always talking, usually alerting you when your health is low but also taking the time to crack jokes that are actually funny. Drunken Robot Pornography is a game that is bursting with style but somewhat lacking in substance. After a while the gameplay gets a bit repetitive as, after all, each stage is essentially a glorified boss fight. Still, there’s a great challenge and lots of fun to be had here, and the packed in editor almost certainly guarantees that interesting new content will always be right around the corner."

,Recommended,209060,12966094,"Posted: 16 November, 2014",all,Ksempac,"When i first started DRP, i was a bit disappointed : i was expecting epic battles against mega robots, and all i was getting was robots seemingly made of cardboard (because they were dying in 15s), or score/checkpoints chasing arenas. Moreover, the controls felt too floaty, especially when on the ground.But I trust Dejobaan, who have yet to disappoint me with a game. So i kept at it, and boy am i glad i did. What seemed like a small game with 15-20 levels, is actually chock full of robots and the difficulty rises slowly but surely. Soon, i was getting into tense fights with robots that seemingly wouldn't die despite the huge firepower i was throwing at them.I like that there is both a platforming aspect, trying to maneuver your jetpacks where you need to, but also a tactical one. Since you're on a timer, you need to figure out the best path to maximize the damages to the Titans, while getting all the vital power-ups you need. Dwell around too much, and the clock will be the death of you.DRP packages this challenging game into a very nice shell. First the graphisms, with grandiose, colorful arenas that are a nice changes to the usual ""gritty brownish"" of many games. Second the soundtrack, which is all over the place in a positive way : one arena will have dubstep, while the next will be more jazzy, and the next one will offer yet another ambiance... Very nice mix all around :). Finally, the silly-in-a-good-way Dejobaan humor ties the story and the gameplay  in a nice way.I still find the controls a bit too floaty for my tastes, but I've mostly adapted to that, and i can't deny the adrenaline rush this game provides me. You dance around countless lasers, you tear off bits and pieces of the Titan one by one, while you keep moving to avoid the smaller enemies and seeker projectives. DRP is really EPIC BATTLES AGAINST GIANT ROBOTS."

OST is worth a download, and is dazzling alongside the light show that is DRP. The story is humorous, and the audio voicemails left for the protagonist fill in the blanks nicely. There is an awesome workshop community for this game, and a reasonably-intuitive titan creator available in-game for you to begin your own contributions. Lots of story mode to go through.CONS:Difficulty goes from ten second victories to 16 failures in a row. Learning to control boost and understanding your objective can be a bit challenging. Homing enemies make getting a good view of the titan, let alone sussing out its weakpoint, very hard and encourage blind shooting.WORTH:I absolutely love this game and it's Steam Workshop options. It goes on sale rather often if you think you won't get your $15.00USD out of it, but the reactions I get from every single person who sees it on my games list makes this title definitely worth it.OVERALL:Where Wonderful End Of The World failed in understanding its own motif and style, DRP proves that Dejobaan can be stylish as hell and have finesse where it counts.SCORE:10/10Full Review Coming Soon"

Just because.The game takes you on a wild journey through the city, fighting robots left and right. These robots very in size, from being as tiny as a cube, to being as tall as the Eiffel Tower (/s). Drunken Robot Pornography also brings something new to the table, in the form of a bullet hell FPS. Think of it as shooting anything and everything while dodging anything & everything from your perspective of your own eyes.The game also features a robot maker, so you can design your own for others to see in the Workshop.

How could it not be with such a great title?The gun feels unsatisfying which is a cardinal sin in an FPS.  There is only one to choose from, and it feels disconnected: when you fire a shot, there's no feedback that it hit anything.The FPS aspect is also wasted in a supercharged dodgefest where your highest priority is collecting items (shoooting is painfully secondary in this game, as you gt more points from collecting random things on the level).  Now deal with this all while trying to beat the clock in every level, and you wonder why they bothered making this a precision FPS.Enemies come from all directions at great speed and in great numbers with none of the typical clues (no HUD indicators or even sound hints), making dodging nearly impossible unless you have a sixth sense.The jetpack feels unreliable in use, can't consistently depend on it because the required on-off-on-off feathering action is immediately forgotten in the heat of battle (with several dozen baddiies coming at you from all sides).If the developers made the game third person and  made tthe jet pack more consistent and would will save this game.  Think more like MDK, and less like Quake Live with a timer.  But in it's current form it falls flat."

,Recommended,209060,9189802,"Posted: 20 February, 2014",all,kmak1g,"First of all, I have to say, what a title. At first I was very skeptical about this game. A bullet hell FPS seemed like a pretty hard task to accomplish. But this game has proven me wrong. My experience so far has been fantastic. Fast paced shooting, over the top gun battles, a fantastic soundtrack and beautiful graphics for an indie title. Most of the arenas start off with the timer paused so you can get a good look at it and plan out your attack. You can either start the timer by attacking or by picking up one of several powerups scattered in the level. As soon as the action starts though, the  timer starts and the time limit is random for each stage. Each time you play, the levels give you a different style of gameplay, so it keeps the challenge bar set pretty high, especially set on the right difficulty for your experience in shooters. One of this games biggest features has to be the in-game editor. This allows you to either create your very own titan for battle and also enables you to customize the level for it as well. From a company that I have just recently looked into, they have absolutely gained my love for this game and I'm sure there will be more to come in the future. I hope this review helps anyone. =)"

I mean, it was hard, but it wasn't a good kind of hard.When a game is hard, but we keep playing it, it's because we know we can do it--that the only thing screwing us over is the fact that we're not good enough, but if we train and perservere, we can overcome the challenge.This game did not provide this. In fact, what I found in this game was a load of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.I'll start off with what I liked about this game: It had a really good sense of humor. The song you got during the menu screen was also pretty awesome. The dialogue was cool and I think it told its story pretty well.What got to me was the gameplay though.It starts off easy as ♥♥♥♥. Level one, you're facing down a boss. Round starts, it's so easy to kill him without him landing a single shot on you. 30 seconds max. Congrats on the achievement.Five levels later, you're dealing with a small island, narrow paths and enemies flying at you from everywhere. It wouldn't be a problem if the physics of this game were any good! There is just so little deceleration that if you're running full speed and you see a ledge, you're going to fall off that ledge. Oh, and that jetpack? Good luck using it to get back up.When you have momentum in this game, it's very hard to change that momentum. Slow down? Try again. Turn around because you've accidentally gone off the path due to avoiding an enemy? HA! That's not happening. Jetpack to safety? You don't have the fuel to stay in the air nearly long enough for your momentum to change direction.Oh, and remember: those paths are not intended to be there so you can navigate them with ease. Really, the enemies aren't even your biggest threat. It's falling off that is! I'm fine with a few areas to fall off, but this game just makes it impossible to do any sort of manuevering once you get far enough.The objectives are typically to get a certain amount of points in a couple minute timespan.

Done in the same graphical style as the aforementioned games, Drunken Robot Pornography tries to a bullet hell FPS.  Unfortunately, however, the game doesn't manage to accomplish much of that - in the hour of gameplay I went through, I was thorougly disappointed and relatively bored.  I'm a huge fan of everything this game promised to be - bullet hell, FPS, and arena-styled gameplay where your reflexes will be tested.  However, this game just throws you into levels where you're either randomly shooting at a boss's appendages until they explode, or shooting at random enemies while jumping around.  There is no real strategy to this, it's completely mindless.  That's my biggest gripe with the game, since you don't feel like you accomplish anything by beating a level, as they start and end so fast (half the time I was surprised to beat a level only 10-20 seconds into it by shooting at whatever red/color object appeared.Drunken Robot Pornography is great visually and in terms of how smooth it controls as well as the way the game was designed, but unfortunately falls flat in every other way.

In order to better serve your fine establishment’s patrons, you decided to give your robo-bartender, Tim, sentience. This is all well and good – that is, until Tim finally snaps under the pressure listening everyone’s problems. Instead, he destroyed the bar, took off with your 12 dancing robot employees and together, begun an assault on the city....While Drunken Robot Pornography certainly has its moments of overly frustrating difficulty, it is a very fun game to pick up for short bursts. Each level is generally limited to a couple minutes at most making it a great choice to start up while dinner is cooking. The small amount of time for each level is not a representation for the length of the game itself. There are tons of levels to be played as you try to save Boston from the mechanical attackers as well as the option to build your own levels and play those made by community members.The $15 price tag is not bad when considering the fun the game brings and it usability as a non-time consuming experience. Personally I would look for a sale on it as it can come down pretty far in price (I got it for only $3.75) making it even more worth the investment. This game is not for the faint at heart, well, at least not for those prone to epilepsy, but it is a good game for players of all skill levels to pick up and learn."

Well... except for all the ones that started lawsuits.  But I digress!   Drunken Robot Pornography (which will now be shortened to Drunken) is a first person bullet hell shooter.  While the name is what made me click on the link out of morbid curiosity, it was the concept which made me buy the game.  (Well... the conceptandwatching those 3-D Touhou fan made videos...)Control and mechanic-wise, Drunken is mostly solid.  Movement and shooting is done without feeling tanky, aiming is fair (as long as it's in the crosshairs, it's good; you don't need to be absolute dead center), the power-ups are useful without feeling overpowered, and there's a good variety of them.  My biggest complaint about the controls is the mode of flight - the jetpack.  The flight time per burst always felt way too short, and it's nearly impossible to overcome inertia once you start to fall (the last point being the most damning for me).  While I did get used to the controls, I still wished the strength of the jetpack from the jet boost power up was the standard for it.The level design and difficulty curve is done decently... for the most part.  For me, I believe the challenges of a stage should come from the enemies and bosses, and not the stage layout itself.  If you're having to fight the stage more than the enemies or bosses, there's something wrong.   That said, there's not much to say about  the good side - the beginning levels are easy, and the later levels are hard - as it should be.  On the bad side, there are two points - level 25 Waterspires, and level 48 Tightrope.  When you encounter these stages, it's like running into a brick wall.  Both contain super tiny platforms with bosses which have far too many parts, and an extremely strict time limit.  The problem with the time limit is if you fall out of bounds, you lose five seconds.  It took me over 100 tries before I could beat Tightrope; it got to the point where if I ever fell off/couldn't reach a platform, I would immediately start the stage over because there was no chance of completing it.  It went far beyond ""tough challenge"" and straight screaming into ""pounding on your keyboard like an enraged howler monkey"" territory.  Like I said though, the other levels were fairly good, and many of them were the good sort of hard where it felt like the game over was your fault and not the game's.  (Like the last level - it took numerous tries, but when I finally beat it, I felt happy instead of exhausted.)As you may guess from just the name, Drunken has a fair amount of humour in it, most of it leaning towards lowbrow.  Personally, I like that, but I also know many people don't like that sort of humour.Overall, I felt this was a good game, and I'm glad I bought it.  If you're on the fence about it, check out a few videos of the game play on youtube to get a better feel of it.  If you're a fan of bullet hell and/or non-realistic first person shooters, I'd suggest it just for the unique feel it has....but ♥♥♥♥ Tightrope.  That level was♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t."

Then again, this is from the developers of ""AaaaaAAaaaAAAaaAAAAaAAAAA!!! for the Awesome"" which are well known for creative (and uniquely named) games.The concept behind the game is simple: The protagonist of the story tries to give his bartender robot intelligence. It goes crazy on a drunken rampage, torches the bar, kidnaps the robot dancing ladies that worked for you and (I guess?) creates a whole bunch of Titans to wreck you. You know what, heck with it. While there is a story here, what you're really here is for the giant robot bullet hell first-person shooter, right? You enter arenas (city locations, I guess), blow stuff up, earn points, and then blow up very uniquely-designed giant robots that have lots of guns. It's quite hectic, and quite simple, and I love it.And at least for me, one of the coolest features is that you can go in and make your own arenas and robots, and put them up on the Workshop for others to challenge.  I'm working on a few experiments with robots now but don't have anything worth posting yet.Anyway, if you like uniquely-designed shooters, this is definitely it.

A difficult and addictive bullet hell which will have you throwing your keyboard, all the while keeping you entertained with cute dialogue and silly references. ""A Winner Is You"" is an old joke which appears very frequently and may turn people off to the writing of the game, and I cannot fault someone for feeling that way because I feel the same, but the writing for the most part is funny and solid beside the somewhat dated reference.

The keyboard and mouse controls use the arrow keys to move, spacebar to jump, and mouse to aim and shoot. Since I don't have a third arm to work all of those at once, the game ended up frustrating me more and more as I played. In the end, though, I kept coming back despite my mounting frustration.I would recommend this game to players who like FPS games but want an extra challenge to go along with it.

Just so hard to review...First off I'd like to say this game is 100% clean.No porn.No alcohol glorification.No violence.It's basically a kids game with a really obcene title. (that doesn't mean it's not challenging or creative, mind you.)Drunken robot pornography (or DRP for short) is a flashy, fast-paced, intense, and deeply challenging game.It's also the most rage inducing game I've ever played.So do I reccomend this game?Well, you don't have to be a genius to see that I reccomended it at the top.Why though?Because it's fun as hell!Flying around shooting robots is some of the most fun I've had in quite some time.It makes you feel like a kid again, jumping around going ""pew pew pew!"" With your little gun taking down enourmous robots and watching as everything explodes.But this fun comes at a price.A hefty price at that.When you get into the game for the first time, you'll notice it's really easy.Trust me, it doesn't stay that way for long.You know how those ""unfair"" games are pretty rage inducing, because they're... Well, unfair?This game is worse.Why?Because it's all your fault.That's right, if you ♥♥♥♥ up, it's on you.While in other rage games, you can pretty much blame your failure on something else.For example, in ""unfair"" games you can blame it on the fact that the game is literally rigged against you.But theres some games where you can't blame it on things, like hotline miami for example.So why isn't hotline miami as rage-inducing as this game?It's simple. ""press R to restart.""In games like hotline miami and super meat boy, you can't blame the game, you have to blame yourself.But it doesn't matter, since you can just hit R and restart.And since each level takes roughly 30 seconds - 1 minute to complete (depending on if you take it slow or not) you aren't losing anything real.What does this have to do with this game?First off, you can't blame the game,Second, each level takes AT LEAST 1 minute, sometimes up to 5 minutes to complete a level.And since it's really easy to die in this game (health packs = as rare as winning the lottery)You have to restart time.""So what?"" I hear you saying.""3 minutes isn't an eternity.""There's this one level called ""fling yourself."" Where you have to take out 4 titans within the alloted time.I spent so long trying to beat this level and I recently finished it, but I spent nearly an hour on it. Thats nearly 30 times I killed the same old 4 bosses in the same old arena FOR A ♥♥♥♥ING HOUR!By the end when I finally beat the level, I felt not like I had beaten a major accomplishment, but that I had survived a holocaust.It also does this weird thing which I'm not sure is innovative or quirky, where sometimes it'll introduce a new concept like collecting alcohol without a gun trying to avoid attacks, or standing at capture points for small lengths of time, and then it never uses them ever again and goes back to the normal shoot bosses/get points sort of thing. It's really weird, and since the level are manditory it fells like they threw a bunch of stuff at the wall hoping it'd stick but none of it did.So should you get this game?Well, if you rage quit easily, stay the HELL away from it.If you like action-packed fast paced games focused on fun over all else, then this is definetly the game for you.Just don't play it if you get mad over games. I really wanted to punch my computer.TLDR: It's a really fun and fast paced action game that can be really rage inducing"

Flying around in a jetpack, shooting giant octopus laser robots, what could go wrong? And yet somehow it still manages to be frustrating and boring. Yes, even with a name like that.The gameplay is basically the same throughout the whole thing. Jump across the platforms, shoot the smaller enemies until the big enemies (""Titans"") appear and then shoot the big enemies. You have a jetpack to give you a short (and I mean very short) boost, but you're stuck with the one gun throughout the whole game. Which is a shame, because it's not even remotely fun. It looks pretty neat I guess, but it's one of the least satisfying guns I've ever seen in a game. It barely even makes a sound, and the only indication that you're hitting your target is a brief flash of red. It's basically a NERF gun with flashing lights on the side.The enemy deaths aren't any better. The titans are made up of plenty of smaller parts, and you have to destroy all of these to finally take out the core. But the parts just turn red and float off with barely a sound. No explosion, no impact, no fun.  Same issue when the thing finally goes down. There's an actual explosion this time, but it's still kind of weak. It's more of a light show than anything else.And then there's the platforming. As mentioned before, your jetpack keeps you in the air for a few seconds at most before you plummet to the ground. If you're lucky, you'll land on a platform. And you do need luck. It's first person, so you basically have no way of telling what you're going to land on without looking straight down, which will of course require you taking your eyes off the enemy. And you can't do that. Thanks to the stupidly short time limits, you have to be shooting the titans pretty much constantly to have any chance of winning. And thanks to the huge amount of enemies and bullets, you can't afford to keep still either. So that means lots of jumping and lots of falling off. And once you do fall off you'll need to make your way to one of the jump pads to get back up, wasting even more time.There are a few powerups as well, but they're not fun and not massively useful either. I counted about four powerups in total. Not impressive.There's also a plot but there might as well not be. Your former robot workers have gone mad and invaded Boston (I think). So go shoot them. It only exists as some brief pre-level descriptions of each Titan, which are silly but not funny, and the few actual jokes they have are repeated many times. ""Ha, it's funny because the evil death robot used to be a stripper/bartender/cleaner/whatever"", every damn time.It's pretty much forgotten about entirely in the levels too. The titans look nothing like anything that could do any sort of work, which seems to be missing a big oppurtunity. Why make jokes about the robot having a silly name or job if it doesn't come across in the enemy design. It's the same with the levels. The descriptions seem to imply uniqueness and personality, but they're all the same collection of floating platforms and jump pads.I could point out more flaws but there isn't much point. This game isn't worth your time."

,Recommended,209060,12797705,"Posted: 4 November, 2014",all,Ernie,"tl;dr This game is a bit mislabeled and levels aren't quite linear in difficulty, but it plays well, had great visuals, and is ultimately very funI had been pretty curious about this game since I saw the trailer for Drunken Robot Battle Royale on fridays or whatever. I didn't know what it meant, but it looked cool. That's always a good start, right? Turns out the actual game is called Drunken Robot Pornography though. Weird name. Totally is in the favor of the game, because it's not something you'll easily forget after hearing it one time. I mean, really, who is going to forget a name with ""pornography?""I had read some reviews and I was a bit skeptical. Most of the negative reviews were really short one liners that complained about the difficulty, so I didn't let that scathe my desire to play.Onto the actual review part that matters:This game is beautiful. Sure, it doesn't quite tell you all the rules in the beginning (but what game really does?), and you start off on a very simple tutorial where I don't think you can die. Basically, the premise of the game is that, because of REASONS (I don't pay attention to story, sorry), you have to dispatch some titans. Titans are these giantass robot things that are hitting up Boston in the worst of ways. So you, with your trusty suit, rocket boots (!), and all purpose gun thing are up to DESTROLISH all of the bots.This game is labeled as a bullet hell game, but I'd think that's pretty inaccurate. Sure, you have to dodge a ton of things, but dodging stuff in games isn't unique. Admittedly, there are, at some points, LOTS of things to dodge, but bullet hells typically rely on you being able to see the whole map at once, so you can actually dodge everything. This game only lets you see 120 degrees or so. That's not quite the same as full field of view. Then again, there's also an entity tracker thing on your HUD that lets you know vaguely where things are. I think. I'm not too sure how it works, but there are totally arrows pointing to things and they seem to move around if you flick your view in a different direction. That said, though, they aren't reliable or are proximity based or something because I've totally had entities on the map that weren't tracked.One thing I love about first person shooters is movement. I love to rocket jump in games that allow it, and I love speed. Just being able to do fancy movement stuff is great in all games, really. It increases the skill ceiling. This game not only makes you move really fast (you can fall off edges if you hold W long enough and try to do ""Air Strafing""-like things to turn; you have to actually press a or d to ensure you don't fall off a ledge during a turn). You basically handle like a car. That's pretty neat. Sure, it's not the best, but it's something to learn. Not only do you move fast, but you have ROCKET BOOTS. Holy♥♥♥♥♥♥that's such a fun thing to play with. Usually with games with jetpacks, you can cheat out the duration of the jetpack by tapping the jump button and they go ahead and let you know that is a feature in this game on the loading screen. Cool! Also, there's totally jump pads that make you go flying up in the air so that you can ascend faster. Man, I love movement in this game. Why can't more games have this? :/But what's  first person shooter without shooting, right? Sure, you can do fancy stuff with jumpin and movin, but that's not good if you're not jump n shoot man, right? Well, admittedly, the weapon variety is limited, it seems. You're stuck with one weapon for the whole game (I think, I haven't beaten the game yet). That's not necessarily a bad thing, though, because you can pick up power-ups within each map. Triple Fire will turn your pew into PEWPEWPEW, rapidfire does what you'd imagine, splinter fire does... a thing, heavy fire... also does a thing, and then there's also other power ups like Decoy and Invulnerability that you can activate by right clicking. This doesn't apply for the entire map, though. Instead, you're limited by how many shots each power up lasts for (600 on all of them, as far as I've been able to tell). There's also likely more upgrades that I've not gotten to yet. But basically, each of them alters how your gun works and lets you murderate the giantass robots fasterer.It gets better, still, though. Sure, while you might so far think that the game is really dull and all you do is shoot things that don't have brains, you also get to stare at the pretty visuals. I mean pretty. Like, dang, these are pretty. There's so many vibrant colors and it feels so sleek. Ok, look, listen, my words can't do it justice. Words are hard. :( Just know that this game is very, very pretty. Some might be a little put off by how many colors thare are, though. Something about sensory overload or something. Whatever.Man, it's not just the visuals that are great either. This game has a pretty solid soundtrack. I dunno, maybe I'm just a sucker for video game music. Fortunately, this game comes with a goodies folder and that gives me access to some of the music (though, tragically, not technically this') . I'd put most of it on a playlist. Sure, there's only 6 songs in the entire thing, but they're genuinely fun to listen to. It, of course, also fits pretty well with the game. It's got a pretty high bpm and that's handy because this game rewards you for going fast.Some gripes with this game, though, are that levels seem to fluxuate heavily on difficulty. I thought that people were kidding and just bad when they were talking about this being an issue, but it's pretty apparent. I did the first 12 levels like no problem, but then I got to Alleyways and I just got #rekt hard. Something about those new guys shooting at me while I'm not able to see them and having to deal with a new boss damage attack... Yeah. That level is really good, though. It does restrict your access to a resource (Rapid Fire) sometimes with the boss covering it via his drop down cannon ball attack thing. I think entering the black circles at all is a bad thing. Dont' touch anything in this game that isn't a platform.This game is also pretty cute with its voicing. Your suit talks to you or something (Think Iron Man and JARVIS) and lets you know things or just offers silly banter between the main character and the main character's suit. Always gotta give props to games that are intentionally silly.Admittedly, I haven't cleared all of this game, yet, but I'd still suggest it to people looking for a new game to play. The game just plays really well and, while you basically are forced to constantly stay moving and holding down m1, it ultimately offers solid gameplay. This game also just feels like it was a testing ground for an arena shooter because good lord this game would be an INCREDIBLE arena shooter. If I had to put a number on this game I'd give it something like an 8. It's certainly not a perfect game, but it's one I'm pretty happy to have a copy of.It's hard to suggest what other games are similar to give you an idea of how it plays. It's not like Team Fortress 2, not like Call of Duty, not like Sanctum, I guess kinda like Tribes: Ascend? What game has stuff on the floor that you can pick up, jump pads, rocket shoes, one weapon, and super fast movement? I dunno. There aren't any comparisons I can make, but that's also something worth noting. This game is somewhat novel. It also feels like this game would fit PERFECTLY in an arcade. In fact, I'd be surprised if this wasn't inspiried by some Japanese arcade game that one of the developers remembers vaguely.Basically, pick up this game because it's kind of incredible. It's pretty, it's fun, it plays well, and the only thing wrong with it (so far; I'll update when I beat the game) is that difficulty is all over the place sometimes."

,Not Recommended,209060,22043711,"Posted: 25 March, 2016",all,TheTitaniumDragon,"Drunken Robot Pornography is a 3D FPS Bullet Hell Precision Platformer. Not only is the name a mouthful, but so is the genre.According to the Steam description:“You're Reuben Matsumoto. You used to own a bar.  You gave your robot bartender, Tim, sentience. He went nuts, stole your other 12 bots, and burned down your bar. He's attacking Boston with 20,000 drones, 40 Titans, and his lieutenants, the 12 Drunken Robot Centerfolds.”Oddly, the Robot centerfolds thing isn’t quite accurate; the in-game descriptions of them suggest that most of them were random robots which did things around the bar, with only a few of them being “exotic dancers”.The game comes complete with a rap video in the menu screen, which is hilarious, well executed, and surprisingly catchy. That isn’t the only song in the game, either; there’s also a parody of the Kingston Trio’s M.T.A. (this one set on the MSTA – the Metropolitan Sky Transit Authority). The soundtrack in general is decent, but the two songs really stand out, and, given that every time a video game has actually done something like that I have felt impressed, it really makes me wonder why more video games don’t use songs in games.In any case, the game’s plotline is light but funny. Reuben Matsumoto is a gritty-voiced sociopath. His sentient, living starfish suit – sadly never seen on-screen – is quirky and provides amusing commentary. You get some random voicemails throughout the game from a reporter, your uncle, your friend who helped you with the robots, and your nemesis, Tim.All of this is fun.The actual gameplay is more questionable, though.The core of the gameplay for most of the levels is running/flying around the level on your jetpack (which has limited fuel per jump). You can gather up to four gun upgrades in each level (though many have fewer), which make you shoot faster/better/more powerfully/more spread shots (with limited ammo). There are a few powerups that a few levels have, most notably invincibility, a bomb, and a an orbital friendship rainbow cannon (which definitely isn’t a MLP reference, no sir).The way the game works is that the player runs around shooting at one or more titans who spawn in the level. The goal is to kill all the titans. You do so by blasting them to bits, shooting off the outermost portions of them at first, and working your way inwards. You must shoot everything off of the core of the titan (or at least, ALMOST everything) in order to kill it. The net result of this is running around a 3D titan while blasting bits off of it.As a bullet hell game, the game throws a bunch of independent enemies at the player, along with having the titan itself often unleash a hail of gunfire/bombs/ect. at the player. You have limited health, and standing still can often result in your death in a matter of seconds in some levels – or even in just a moment if you’re in the wrong place at the wrong time in a few places.It starts off easy enough – almost too easy, really, but the idea is to get you used to the idea of how the game works. The first eight levels or so are all quite simple, and you’d think “Oh, this isn’t going to be so bad.”Things then start going to hell.The first real nasty level I ran into was around level 19. But the game has a very odd difficulty curve. And this is where we get into the flaw of this game.Sometimes, people complain about games being badly designed when they really mean they’re badly programmed. Drunken Robot Pornography is a well-programmed, poorly-designed game.The problem comes from the mix of genres I noted above. A 3D FPS bullet hell game suffers from a problem – you have a restricted field of view. This means if attacks are coming from above, below, or the sides, you can’t see them coming. Worse, some of the attacks clip through the scenery, meaning that if you’re behind a blocking wall, they can still hit you even though you can’t shoot back at them (or see them coming, in some cases).Likewise, as many, many people know, precision platforming and the first-person perspective mix extremely poorly. The problem is that you can’t see where your feet are, and if you need to be looking in another direction when you jump (and you almost invariably do in this game), you can’t tell where you’re going to land. This is especially bad when you’re floating around through the air on your jetpack and need to land on a small launchpad to do so again. This is not helped by the game’s often-frantic pacing, and the fact that you need to continually move while fighting to avoid being destroyed by a hail of enemies and gunfire.Finally, a few of the levels (most notably Tightrope, a late-game level) have extremely, extremely tight time limits.The net result of this is that, even more than two years after its launch, according to the final level’s scoreboard, only 303 people had beaten the game. Glancing at the achievements, 78.5% of the people who played this game beat the first level. 2% of people beat the final boss. That suggests only about 1 in 40 people who start this game see it through.And it isn’t that the game is all that long, either – it took me about 9 hours to beat the game and get 10 of the 11 achievements.No, it is that some levels are incredibly, incredibly frustrating because the intrinsic design of the game fails to deal with the limitations its own genre sets for it.The thing is, it isn’t that the levels get uniformly harder – the levels DO get harder as the game goes on, and there’s a difficulty curve to it. But superimposed on that are a few random difficulty spikes, levels which are extraordinarily more difficult than anything else in the game, usually because of some combination of a tight timer, enemies spawning behind the player or in such a configuration that it is difficult to strafe away from them all at the same time, and, most frequently, precision platforming.The net result is that there are a few brick wall levels which are utterly miserable to beat, followed by a number of levels that the player is likely to beat on their first try. There is little rhyme or reason to this, and the robot boss levels – while often bearing snazzy music – are generally not appreciably more difficult than the others, though they generally do feel a bit snazzier in terms of design.These difficulty spikes make the game difficult to recommend. The game’s levels, when they’re good, are generally reasonable enough, while the extremely difficult levels are often extremely frustrating. It isn’t that they’re unbeatable, it is that they are just extraordinarily difficult. I probably spent 75% of my playtime on about half a dozen of the most difficult levels, including the final level, a very neat level wherein you stand on the boss while you blow it to bits which pretty much exhibits all of the design flaws of the game.The game is interesting, but I don’t know if it is good. Most people wouldn’t like it, and would get frustrated with it and give up. If being interesting is more important than being good, maybe this is worth a try, but if you have anything other than a very high threshold for frustration, it is best to steer clear."

The levels are all short enough that mistakes have no long-term consequences, meaning that the game can be essentially bruteforced --- that is, one can repeat a level over and over again until it is beaten by a coincidence of sorts, developing little to no skill along the way. The aesthetics are quite frankly disgusting, with all the levels being totally indistinct ""futuristic"" sets of platforms and all the robots (""titans,"" as the game calls them) being totally indistinct messes of semi-random pieces. I cannot remember exactly what a single one looks like, but I have a very clear image of what they all look like --- and that is what one calls bad aesthetics. The whole thing is compounded by terrible in-jokes abound and a sense of humor that could only be inbred in the indie scene. This alone would be typically enough to damn a game, but Drunken Robot Pornography takes it a step further.The bullet hell genre is interesting not because of its sea of bullets, but because there is always a pattern to the sea of bullets --- a casual observer may call it chaos, but any experienced savant of the genre knows that bullet hell has nothing at all to do with chaos. Recognizing and reacting to these patterns is an essential part of playing any bullet hell game. In Drunken Robot Pornography, bullets are often sprayed in random directions, or wherever the player happens to be going. There is barely any rhythm to get into, and in the rare occasions when there is one, it is pitifully simple, and the enemies that just happen to follow the player quickly become the bigger threat. This would be a huge annoyance if the game wasn't so easy (and yes, I played on the hardest difficulty level) --- essentialy, the best strategy is always to grab a few power-ups, find a place where the robot isn't shooting, and spray bullets directly at for a few seconds. I have no doubt that impressive powerplays are possible, but the game does not make them particularly desirable: in Ketsui, to complete the game on one credit at all, one must develop a robust, powerplay-like strategy. Play ten minutes of that game and then all of this one and say which one you remember better.While merging bullet hell concepts with modern shooter mechanics is a good idea, this game fails to pull it off, and fails miserably. Those interested in what a decent developer might do with the concept should play Vanquish."

Difficulty curve is all over the place. Some of the hardest levels were in the first half of the game, and usually I'd end up playing through a lot of levels, getting stuck on one for a while, and then going back to having no issues for another round of stages. This trend kept up from probably some 15-20 levels into the game until the very end.2. Time constraint seems unnecessary, there are a few stages where it's the only real enemy because a titan is so durable and takes too long to kill. Often this is coupled with not being given proper firepower (if you don't have at least one of the heavy fire or rapid fire, you're probably underpowered). Other times getting up close to destroy the boss the easy way results in taking massive damage.3. The ""bullet hell"" part is only partially true. The problem that presents itself in this game is that you have a relatively limited viewing field, as opposed to full information, and you have a pretty fat hitbox. So the only thing this has in common with a bullet hell game is that there's stuff everywhere, but more often than not it's more a matter of luck than skill that you dodge it.4. Damage is wack, yo. Lasers do 25% of your health and nothing else comes close to that, but you also have no invicibility frames and can be spam-combo'd from full health to zero in milliseconds. It's way too punishing for a single mistake with how long some of the fights can go on.5. Terrain is often unwieldly/unfitting. Any vertical arena is automatically trash. Any arena comprised mostly of narrow straightaways or circles is automatically trash. Some of the arenas are too small for the bosses you have to fight. Some of them are too big. Not every arena is bad, but a lot of them have issues. There were also many instances where I found myself stuck in terrain with no way to get out (thus dying shortly after as all the drones caught up to me). Even got stuck inside a titan once or twice.At its core the game can be pretty fun when it's not trying to be stupidly demanding of the player (here's looking at you, level 48, and your probably-a-typo time condition + awful arena) but it leaves me in a sour mood as I sit here having just completed the final boss, and practically makes me say ""hell with it"" to that last achievement. It's not worth it.Also, $15 for a game with little actual ""design"" to speak of aside from some great graphic designs that get old a few hours in and gameplay mostly consisting of somewhat samey fights might be a bit steep, I got it 75% off and felt I got my money's worth there at least, but at full price it's probably too bare bones for most people.Really wanted to like you, D to the R to the capital P, but you just made it too hard to do so."

Either you have taken an interest in my reviews personally, or you are looking to buy this game. Assuming the first guess is correct, you have terrible taste. The second...well, now you aren't sounding quite as dull. I mean, one time I remember when I was cleaning my room about a couple of months back and I had found some notebooks from my sophomore year in highschool. Apparently, I tried to be edgy and cool and generally somebody I wasn't so that people would like me, even though I kept this edginess in my notebook where only I would see it. See, when I was young I was half-expectant for people to automatically do inclusive things with me even though I was a massive tool with Communistic tendencies. I once even started to draft my own manifesto but then decided ah ♥♥♥♥ it this is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Point of the story being that what I wanted perceived of me wasn't going to occour the way I had wanted it to. Which says to me that you have to be your own person and not let people dictate who you are and how you act. Remember: ""To thine own self be true."" You can find that in the Bible. Which reminds me of this time I was sufficiently inebriated and had to work the next morning. It was awful.:CONS:-This game didn't make me feel the inclusive feeling I longed so earnestly for during my school years.-This game didn't remove the regret I have for not taking certain risks/chances.-This game didn't solve my mommy issues stemming from hormones in the water supply, my dog's parvo, or my tolerance to hip-hop music.:PROS:+Drinking alcohol gives me points.+I shoot things.+You can make your own titan shaped like a phallus and make it attack you.+I made a titan shaped like a phallus and made it attack me.Give this game a try, if not just for the score."

Drunken Robot Pornography is a fairly standard bullet-hell shooter in a first person perspective. The game consists of multiple arenas in which you destroy a number of small enemy forces followed by a number of larger bosses. This must be completed inside the timeframe.The actual shooting in the game provides very little feedback making the game kinda feel dull to play. The graphical style is bright and colourful but lacks depth.The storyline is not important to the gameplay at all, but it's humerous to read (in a good way) - even if the plot elements at play are kinda trivial.I can't recommend it at the standard retail price - but if it goes on sale you may have a few hours of fun with the game if you're a fan of the bullet-hell or first-person shooter genres (like myself)."

Despite not actually being pornography (though that word in the title is what initially caught my attention), this game is a solid title that any fan of bullet hell should pick up.The basic gameplay is that you have a jetpack and a gun, the goal in each stage is to either get a certain number of points or destroy one or more titans, which usually has a time limit. My only issue with the control is that when on the ground it's hard to change direction while moving and the jump has a lot of up, but not a lot of over.Some would say it's too easy once you've destroyed a titan's weapons (no♥♥♥♥♥♥sherlock), but that doesn't take into account the fact that there's almost always something shooting at you, not just the titan.My only real problem comes about ten or so stages in, the game starts off easy with a slow and steady difficulty curve, then the difficulty suddenly spiked and then went back to a steady rise from where it jumped to, nothing to really break the experience. You can just play on the easy setting if you can't handle it, and you won't have to start over for each difficulty you play, which I like.One last thing to mention, the music. While I wouldn't say the songs get stuck in my head, they are pretty darn enjoyable and sound like something you'd hear in a bar.Definitely a game you should get, assuming you don't mind dying a lot."

The shooting is pretty basic tough, there is no recoil or reloads to worry about, the ammo is infinite and there is only one gun, albeit with a few powerups.There are 3 types of levels that I've encountered so far: 1. The boss levels with one or multiple titans (those huge robots) that you have to destroy by shooting their extremities in order to pick them appart piece by piece while they shoot at you in a bullethell fashion. These titans area varied and the levels pose different degrees of challange aswell as giving each level a slightly different playstyle. One level you're flying around an open area dodging lasers and in another level you're jumping from platform to platform trying to get to multiple bosses etc..2. Score attack levels, these levels require you to attain a certain score within a set amount of time by killing small enemies or collecting martinis witch are worth points, here the focus is more on movement than shooting but the break from the madness of the titans is welcoming.3. Cocktail levels. These are my least favourite levels. In order to beat these you need to collect bottles of alcohol and deliver them to a drop zone in order to reach a score goal. The more you collect without dropping them off the more points you get for each bottle pickup. The problem with these levels is that, while you are doing this, there are things shooting at you and if you get hit you lose half your bottles and need to collect them again. These levels tend to get frustraging quite quickly.The difficulty curve can spike quite a lot and sometimes you will hit walls that will take more than a few tries to properly take on. And there is no choice between levels, the progress is compleatly linear, so...if you're stuck... you're stuck.1 more thing I didn't like is that the screen can get really cluttered with unecessary things like explosions whenever you hit a weakspot on a boss or screenshake when a titan dies or the smartbomb powerup that makes you virtually blind for a moment. All this can make you lose health or even streight up die. I think the devs went a bit overboard with the flash in some situations.Also the soundtrack is pretty good and the menu music is...well....interesting to say the least.Overall I think this game is pretty promising and I look foreward to finishing it (if I can...it's pretty bloody hard)."

The oddly good 2D menu screen just screams ""I'm an awesome indie-type game"". This game obviously has everything to do with robots, and practically nothing to do with them being drunken pornographically. It only gets better from there. Gameplay wise, this is highly frustrating, but in a good way because the controls are fantastic, not to mention just plain satisfying. The controls basically make the game. Once you get a feel for the good but unique controls, you'll spend zero time frustrated by them and more time enjoying the amazing soundtrack and gorgeous, visuals. You have a jetpack with power limited not enough to where its annoying how much you run out, but at the same time not too much to make the game too easy either. Basically, if you time the jumps right, you can float on the same y-coordinate for the span of the level, its really only height that's limited. Falling and trying to boost yourself back up is nearly impossible, but starting on level ground after a jump, you're fine to float anywhere, but again, that's only if you time it right which takes some serious getting used to. Enough about the Jetpack, lets talk guns. Any level beyond the ""tutorial"" level, which really just gives you what buttons to push, your guns are basically useless without one or two of either ""triple fire"", ""rapid fire"", ""splinter"", or ""heavy fire"". If you can, get sheilds, but they aren't near as completely necessary as the gun accessories. The last level (not counting the survival level)  is nearly impossible without having AT LEAST triple fire and rapid fire. This game is so unique! BUY IT!"

There are attempts to shake up the gameplay, and they're certainly appreciated, but they don't stick around. It's reminiscent of older shooters, where airtime is equal to or greater than ground time, bounce pads are all over the placeCertainly worth buying on sale if it looks interesting to you, although I can't say I expect to be playing this game for years to come.

But I believe its a hidden gem that not many people know about. The storyline is basically that you had a bar and employed robots there. You gave emotions to your head robot bartender to empathize with customers but then he decided Humans were stupid and wanted to take over the world. Your quest now is to hunt down all of his creations and destroy them and him. Gamplay is mostly a platformer style and a 3D bullet hell style. Somehow this combination works but can be challenging. It also has an excellent theme song and background music.

You jetpack around a stage and kill enemies until a titan spawns, kill titan, retry again because you placed #12875 on the leaderboards, play it again, get better, get placed #278, feel better, move on, repeat.What kept me into this game was the fact that i could get drunk and still play this, til around the final-ish levels when everything started getting alot more time-based rather than difficulty (which kind of annoyed me tbh) The sweet music was catchy as well."

It's a game that you probably won't play for more than an hour before you get fed up with how unfair it is and quit, but the next day you'll come back (because it was super fun while it lasted) and you'll be a little better and get a little farther before you rage quit. Before long it has become a habit and you can't imagine what your life was like before this game. DRP is like the arcade games of old. It didn't matter that their gameplay never changed or that you found yourself playing the same section over and over before you were able to beat it because the gameplay was fun and the difficulty meant you got a REAL sense of achievement from acomplishing something. Unlike those old arcade games which were short on content, DRP has near infinite content with the built in levels, modes, and arenas supplimented by those bosses and levels created in the steam workshop and by the developers themselves every week for the Battle Royale weekly challenge. This constant stream of new content but old gameplay lends itself well to a game that you play in short bursts for a long period of time.If you're looking for a game with progression, or that holds your hand, or that sucks you in for hours at a time then DRP is not for you, but if you are looking for a game in the spirit of arcade classics which offers scores of content and several game modes then I highly recommend it."

,Recommended,209060,10457662,"Posted: 13 June, 2014",all,PheonixGRX,"Drunken Robot Pornography is a rather great game. It combines both the feel of a FPS game with the complexity of a bullet hell game, with starting levels lasting up to 2 minutes at most, and increasing in difficulty as the game progresses. It allows the player to jump in at their own pace by having the timer, and the enemies, only start as soon as the player either shoots his weapon, or grabs a powerup. The use of powerups is a rather refreshing touch as well, allowing each powerup to be used simultaniously, rather than only getting to use 1 at a time. The music is fast paced, helping the player get into the rush of the game, and with the combination of techno and dubstep, helps bring it all into a whole new feeling.The only downside in all of this so far is that the Titans do feel as though they are too easy to defeat with the weapons easily being destroyed, allowing you to spend the rest of the time taking down the main body.Overall, I give this game a 7.5/10, as even though it is a great game, there is still room for improvements.

I'm not sure if the minor mistranslations in the dialogue are there on purpose to add to that confusion, but never I heard them sound so badass!My only wish is that there could be a 3rd person or even VR version just to make it easier to see what's directly behind you, and there WILL always be something behind you!"

Most other bullet hell games are topdown or third person, but the first person jetpack mechanic realy makes this a totaly difrent experience from other games, while still feeling familier.If you get easly frustraited at games, probably dont get this one, but if you want to sit back and destroy hords of robots with a jetpack, but it, and you even get a good song to go with it. (Did I mention I love the song?)"
