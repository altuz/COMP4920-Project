This is a very well balanced fighting game with surprizingly deep and sophisticated game play. The characters are mostly unique and fun to try out. This game begs you to keep playing it to learn the moves of other characters to further increase your fighting skills.Saddly because it is currently still stuck with now-closing Games For Windows Live (GFWL) 3rd party DRM my experience has been frustrating and sad. I can't play this game anymore. Once this game is ported over to Steam Works instead of GFWL I would completely recommend it to any fan of fighting games.

,Recommended,209120,23128159,"Posted: 21 May, 2016",all,Gao Li,"7/10 A good game with several severe drawbacks to itReview for theStreet Fighter X Tekken: Complete Packversion 1.08Both theStreet Fighter& theTekkenfranchise are video game milestones. Capcom’sStreet Fighter II(1991) became famous for introducing mechanics we nowadays perceive as normal, such as combos, cancellations, or lenient controls. Bandai-Namco’sTekkenseries (1994 ongoing) then built upon this & Sega’sVirtua Fighter’s legacy (1993 ongoing) to sweep the market with 3D fighting arenas, new control schemes, more realistic fighting moves, & beginner friendly controls that displayed a remarkable, never before seen depth to them. It seems like a no-brainer for these two giants to meet up in this crossover from 2012. But whether this 2.5D mashup fared well or not, is a completely different question.About the gameMechanicsMovesetsThe mechanics & controls of bothTekken&Street Fightercould not be any further apart with one being build around 3D arenas while the other was made with 2D environments in mind.SFxTtries to solve this problem by greeting players with a surprisingly deep fighting mechanic that has multiple means of individualizing the characters’ movesets. Nevertheless, using Tekken characters does feel alien.http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=685384490Generally, the game shares several of the mechanics of theStreet Fighter IV franchise(2008-2014), but adds optional, simplified special attacks (e.g. instead of ↓↘→Ⓟ just pressing ↘Ⓟ), customizable button combinations, & quick combos to make it easier forTekkenplayers & newcomers to find their way into the game. Simplified moves worked well inTatsunoko vs. Capcom(2008) & sure enough do their job here.Tag TeamThe tag team system is inspired by theTekken Tag Tournamentseries (2000 ongoing) with tagouts either being performed through quick combos or by pressing medium kick & medium punch at the same time. The initial problem of the game was that the amount of damage dealt was too low & because each team possesses two healthbars, fights often ended in timeouts instead of KOs. After several patches, this was remedied, but fights can still be unnecessarily drawn out. On the upside, tag teams can even be created in online ranked matches and up to four players can duke it out at once.ScrambleThe scramble mode is obviously the highlight of the on-/offline multiplayer experience, four players can play simultaneously in teams of two. The rounds are quick and chaotic, which just adds more to the fun.GemsTo further balance the game,SFxThas a gem mechanic. Each character can carry up to three gems at the same time, each having different effects & prerequisites to activate them. Although the gem system makes sense in theory, in practice it is a mess. The amount of available gems is way too large leading to a multitude of confusing combinations that discourage users from looking into this mechanic altogether. Even worse, a large amount of premium gems are only available as purchasable DLC, thus missing the point of being there to level the virtual battle field.PandoraIn theory Pandora is a great mechanic; sadly it’s not so much in practice. Players sacrifice one party member to temporarily boost the remaining protagonist's powers for a brief amount of time. Once Pandora runs out, the player automatically loses. Therefore it is key to knock the other party out swiftly; unfortunately, because of the game’s design, Pandora rarely helps win any rounds but instead causes players to lose. So, it’s hardly ever used.http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=685384665CustomizationTo individualize characters beyond the gems & customized button combinations, players can color their characters’ clothes. The feature even allows players to either wrap the characters in latex or neon glowing schemes(To see an example of a neon character, click here). Additionally, all base game characters have DLC outfits that are inspired by characters from both franchises.BacklashThe game had several issues when it first came out. Shaking life bars irritated players & low damage dragged matches out. But it was the DLC policy that ruined the game for many.ControversyAlthough theSFIVseries was known for its on-disc DLC, Capcom came under scrutiny uponSFxT’s initial release when it became public that several of the announced twelve DLC characters were already included on the game’s disc - locked behind a paywall that cost as much as many video games ($19.99 USD). More than that, the Playstation 3 & Vita releases of the game had five additional DLC characters, namely Toro Inoue, Kuro, Cole Mac Grath, Pac-Man, and Bad Box Art Mega Man, while the PC & Xbox360 releases did not receive any exclusives. Further, the Xbox 360 version received even more criticism as the online tag team bouts mentioned in the game's manual did not find their way into that version & were not patched in later on. The big disappointments over the game lead players to stay away from it altogether. After initial attempts, Capcom then decided to stop promoting the game.http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=688920867Games for Windows LiveFor the longest time, Capcom refused to transfer bothStreet Fighter X Tekken&Resident Evil 5over from Games for Windows Live to Steam Works. And whileRE 5received this treatment in 2015,SFxTstill uses GfWL. Windows 10 users won’t have any problems logging in, but others will have to jump through hoops to get the game working in the first place. However, once that’s done, the game & other GfWL services will work just fine.OnlineSadly, due to its age, negative reputation, less popular design choices, & GfWL, the online population is considerably small & encountering cheaters who use lag switches or rage quit before they lose a match is not uncommon. The remaining players who don’t cheat are often times veterans who far outlevel any newcomers making it increasingly difficult for newcomers to win any matches at all.OptimizationThere's not a lot to say about the game's graphic and control options. It's just as marvelous as with theSFIVseries with different AA features, V-Sync, & completely customizable button configurations.ConclusionDespite it all,SFxTis a good game that suffered from questionable management choices which tarnished the game’s reception & subsequently was part of what discolored the company’s reputation for years to come. The arcade stories are fun and the animations have the right level of goofiness to stay refreshing. The PC port is marvelously optimized with tons of graphics options that even allow it to run on ""toasters"". It's definitely worth picking up for a fair price & is truly something that fans would want to check out.See also:Super Street Fighter IV review (in German)"

And I believe my first Playstation game was Tekken 1. I have loved fighting games since I was a little kid, and I in fact, wanted to get this game, but because of some negative reviews on this game by some people, I decided to just stay away from it for a while. Now that it was on a Steam sale, I have decided to buy it, and well, I am not really sure why people would give bad ratings to this game....sure, you can't really use the Tekken characters like you normally would in the original Tekken games, as the one that made this game is Capcom, but those Tekken characters still maintain their own character even in this game. It kind of sucks that Jin is kind of hard to use in this....or I should say, he either sucks or is for the real hardcore players....or possibly, I simply don't understand how he works in this game yet. But Jin kind of does not really feel like the Jin in the Tekken series. It sucks even more because you can't use Devil Jin, either.But yes, other than that, I think this is pretty a decent fighting game. I like how so easy it is to do combos and it just feels so good when you successfully execute chain combos using two of your characters. I in fact loved Tekken Tag Tournament 2, which I thought it was the best Tekken game yet, and personally, I would like to say Street Fighter x Tekken is simply the best fighting game I have ever played. Perhaps I am exaggerating, but the fact remains. The game is just damn good. You can also mod the costumes, which are available on the internet or you can simply make your own by using a certain program, so the replay value is there. All I can say is that the game is rather underrated in my opinion. The game is definitely not as bad as people say it is.Well, it might be because I am a fan of Street Fighter and Tekken series, but I don't know. I believe if you are a fighting game fan, you'd love it in my opinion.9.9 out of 10"

You'll get all the DLC characters(which are yours by right for free, as they are already in every copy of the game as hidden stuff), including the Playstation exclusives. Online play fixed and no problems with windows 10.Now, talking about the game: fun game, really solid roster with a good move list for most of the characters. SF characters moves pretty much like in SFIV, including lots of their combos, Tekken characters got part of their classic move set from various titles of the Tekken franchise, and other ones to make everything connects. It is a very agressive and fast-paced game though, and that is the most basic difference from the SFIV game style.Cenarios are really beautiful and creative, though they are super colorful and can annoy some players. Art style is basically SFIV with the watercolor stuff in place of the ink stuff. Character models are just ugly. They are kind of improved versions for SF characters and the clunky muscles new models for the Tekken ones.Another counterpoints? The gem system. It is boring, uninspired and justs adds one more thing to be careful throughout the gameplay. Music and voice acting is also pretty bad. Specially for the Tekken side. Still, really fun game. Wouldn't bother with the competitive side of it, but love to play it with friends and mess around."
,Recommended,209120,7828590,"Posted: 29 November, 2013",all,[FoxNull],"SFxT is the first of two crossover games starring hit characters from the Street Fighter and Tekken Franchises, obviously. Since Tekken is 3d and Street Fighter is 2D this particular game made by capcom uses the traditional 2D fighting style and is a strictly 2v2 tag-team game in which you can either play through the story or play online using GFWL. Personally as a street fighter and tekken fan i felt they managed to pull it off fairly well, although there are a few bumps in the road that stop it from achieving true greatness. First the good things; The graphics look pretty good and use the same art style as Street Fighter 4, The characters for the most part are faithfully represented from their respective games and its very fun to see these characters interact with eachother, the combat is fluid and responsive and there are a decent amount of characters to choose from. Finally from my list of likes about the game is the fact you can easily download mods that reskin the characters and give them new costumes without having to pay for it as DLC thus enhancing the experience when i can put naughty costumes on Alisa and Lili. (Clientside only though) Now for the negatives about the game; this game caused massive controversy within the fighting game community for 3 reasons with the first one being the fact that 12 additional characters are OVERPRICED DLC ONLY as well as extra costumes and COLOR SCHEMES for customization. The second reason being the ""Gem System"" which is frankly something you should look up on the SF Wiki and the final thing being often horrendous lag against online players from great distances as a result of poor netcode. I'll throw in an extra complaint i think some people may agree with in that many of us wanted to see a SakuraxAsuka vs KarinxLili tag-team showdown, but we didnt get it. Again. While i do feel that crossover games of this caliber are rare and should be treated with great respect, i also feel capcom's greedy and selfish business practices got in the way of making this game something truly legendary for future generations. For what it is, its one of a kind, if you can enjoy it despite some of its shortcomings, its a very fun game and i quite enjoy it especially with the many mods i can put on my favorite characters. We'll have to wait for Namco's Tekken x Street Fighter to come out and see if it tops Capcoms initial offering. 7/10"

Come on Capcom even in your super nintendo days you had better animated scenes. I can't believe that Namco let them do this. You would think a story of 2 greatest fighting games would be way better. The practice mode is laughable, tekken 5 had a better scheme.  Paying for costumes that in the past were unlockable. The only thing thats make this game worth while is the competition between human players, because u can button munch your way to passing the computer. Remember how hard Street Fighter 2 was to pass on normal.Capcom why you stop caring? This game should just be 15.00 on steam its already aged.

You can mix between punches and kicks and up in strength Light > Medium > Heavy for 3 attacks, then a ""Launch"". Then a bunch of single special moves, and then 2 throws (forward and back throw). Theres also these quick combos you activate with just 2 buttons if you have enough energy, you can set 2 different pre-made combos from a list of like 6 in the menu.So overall I feel its not fluid combo system. The game is also so fast it seems like you need to input all your buttons before hes even done with the first swing. Naturally I feel like I want to pause for the attack animation to finish before I input another button into the combo but instead you need to push them all as fast as possible. Also things like countering a throw with a throw seem crazy hard considering how fast the game is going.The AI on some charecters on arcade seem better then others. Like the Guile & Abel team. Guile throws sonic booms, waits for you to get in range and tears you up. Abel just walks endlessly at you and leaves himself open for medium hits. That was the worst team I noticed but I havn't faced them all yet.The graphics, audio and charecter models are really good. Bryan, Hwoarang, Dalsim, Yoshimitsu, King look amazing. Bryan acting like a complete sciopath I find kinda weird. But then Law, Blanka, Paul, and somewhat Guile for exmaple look like they came from some bizzaro cartoon world. The rest are pretty good.The Gem system is kinda cool as you can customize your charecter slightly before you go into a fight. I don't like how the better gems and combos can only be gotten by the DLC. I hate DLC, they should just update you that content for already buying the game.I am a Tekken fan and this game doesn't bring a lot of Tekken to the table. Overall it would be great to play on versus with someone at your house or at a party but in general I wouldn't get it unless it was on sale for atleast 50%.Lasty I get a constant screen tearing line across the middle whie I play, It gets pretty annoying. My fps is always stuck at around 60 even with Vsync off; the ingame benchmark runs at 300+ fps but normal gameplay is always 60. Vsync, Fixed/Variable framerate, Single gpu mode, nothing gets rid of the line."

SFxT has been made easier to target a larger audience and getting ridiculous combos is easily achievable even for pad-nubs like myself. That motivates at first, but actually hurts when playing online. This, too, uses GFWL for online-play (like SSFIV), but the PC version is not en par with the console version yet - A major patch is still not out, which means that the PC version can be unplayable at times due to lag.

Honda and Eddie Gordo off of the top of my head). It's a decent game but has bad netcode if you want to play online, not to mention that you have to use Games for Windows Live if you want to play it. That app is dying though, so perhaps those problems will be solved when it rightfully craps out. If you want it for single player, I can fully recommend it though. As with all fighting games, make sure you have a game pad. Compared to Street Fighter 4, I pefer this, it just feels better made and the AI doesn't out and out spam you with cheap attacks all the time. 6/10 is my score. It's a competant Street Fighter game - a game which I think that I may be outgrowing because nothing ever changes, nor can it without ruining anything. The Tekken characters have simplified moves to fit with the aging franchise of SF, which may annoy Tekken players out there."

Read and watched all the news relating the game before it was available. The game was finally released with alot of confidence in Capcom I thought It was worth 59.99 x 2 because I had It originally for Xbox 360. I Didnt buy the Steam version for some time after it's release because I remembered It not catching my interests enough. It's a shame that the Namco/Bandai version called Tekken X Street Fighter was only partially developed and Namco/Bandai decided to pull the plug. I like The Street fighter series very much aswell, but I felt that the Tekken side that Capcom arranged was sorta looked at like a joke lineup. The way the characters on the Tekken side are very goofy looking and just feel wierd to play in the Street Fighter Universe. I thought the game also made players go through a Windows Live service was unnecessary. The community Online is small enough and I think It made it smaller with the extra hopes to jump through to play someone online. I would not recomend this if you like Street fighter and definetely not recomend this title if your a Tekken fan. 6/10"

I'm as big a fan of scantily clad women as anyone (which may have a lot to do with the whole ""father"" status), but there's a time and place- and in the middle of a fighting game ain't it. The way this character is presented would be funny if it weren't so utterly grotesque.Oh, and in-game purchases? Yeah, no. Sorry, Capcom, but we're through."

WRONG!!!, Fighting games on PC are way better than the consoles, the online is immaculate even for a GFWL supported game. Fighting games have been huge in my life and personally this is an enjoyable game, the only problem with it was how the console counter part was deemed bad for the DLC on the Disc fiasco. the PC version is different of course and with the PC version, some stuff were taken out (of course the 5 PS3/Vita characters were removed but can be added via a Mod), the items that were taken out didn't really effect the gameplay but what was a worry is that you're not getting everything from the console version which should be available on the PC version like additional Alt(not swap) costumes which most people did like on the console version.Gameplay mechanics that are in the game are quite interesting seeing as this game is a mordern version of X-Men vs Street Fighter with the tagging system/Marvel Super Heroes with the overlooked gem but in earlier builds, it was glitchy and unplayable.i do want people to support this title but i can't really, the options are quite limited in the game what you can do and mainly taken from Super Street Fighter IV and Ultimate Marvel vs Capcom 3.for now, i'd give it 6.../10 but it's worth trying out"

The fast fighting mechanics is really fun to master and Street Fighter mixing with Tekken is nostalgic all around. One obviously frustrating issue is Games for Windows Live but that's an entirely different argument although still a very big part of this game. For a while GFWL was down and I couldn't reach my save game. When I found there was an offline account option the issues were over. I like fighting games but I'm not the type to master them like some Korean kid playing SF4 constantly in his local arcade. SS4 was not fun due to the seemingly slower gameplay with more cartoon graphics and a very challenging system to learn before it's even remotely enjoyable. This game is much more accessible to anyone who wishes to casually play a fighter. Graphics are crisp but I'm not in to the comically absurd character design. A bit of smart button smashing can lead to a sweet combo and character switch for an even better combo. I recommend this to any on the fence fighting game gamers.

I found this game easier to learn however with the few characters and the dumb gem system, some things should be here. There should be more characters, more arenas, unlockables, and more of a challenge. Beating hardest mode wasn't crazy difficult. So overall, yes buy this game if you love fighters or stree fighter.

They took the simple gameplay of street fighter 2, and added it to horrible art design. Chun-li should never have hands bigger than Zangief. Thankfully in this game. SvT adjust everyones design. Heads are proportionate to their bodies, and not overdone as much. That said the gameplay is where it shines. They did away with the simplicity of SF4, and instead has more of a combo based system in play. Naturally so the SF people can take on combo gameplay of Tekken characters. Almost a cross betwwen MarvelvCapcom and Tekken tag tournament. Combo fighting and switching characters mid fight as they share one life bar. The huge downside of course is the controversial idea of having half the roster locked on your game, and only available through dlc purchase. That reason alone i cant recommend this game as a disc buy. However, on steam when the game, and its dlc is on sale. I cant recommend it enough. Since Capcom is determined to shove an update of S4 at us every year. I havent played a good SF game since Third Strike. Looks like all they needed was some innovation to the usual SF gameplay.

Pathetic AI and a skilled community make the game hard to get into.  I picked it up mostly for the Tekken characters, but Capcom turned many of them into cartoony jokes.Now, though, the game won't even start.  It's just a black screen.  Tried uninstalling and reinstalling, and it's still just a black screen.I'm never giving Capcom any more money unless they fix this game or give me a refund.  At this moment, Capcom runs a dirty business, and if you're smart you will stay far away from them.Can't wait for Tekken 7 to come out.

A little short, but tone of characters to go through, plus a few double-team moves still to learn how to use. The Steam controller works well with the game, though I'm not a huge fan of it, or just need to learn to use it better.The worst thing is that nothing saves unless you log into Windows for Gaming Live. Which is just plain annoying as I never knew this before I bought the game. I understand online play might use this feature, but to save customisations, this is just a plain insult to customers.Then online doesn't seem to do anything and just shows a turning circle.

,Recommended,209120,27267836,"Posted: 24 November, 2016",all,CrispyChris,"The concept of this game is awesome mesh Street Fighter and Tekken into one game. You battle in a Street Fighter style, so the game feels a lot like Street Fighter with Tekken characters in it.Getting the game setup is kind of a pain. You have to either login to your Games For Windows Live account or create a Games For Windows Live Account. Once you are logged into you GFWL account you then need to quit the game and install a couple of GFWL packages (The game will have downloaded these for you). After you have these packages installed you can boot up the game and login into your GFWL account and it will create a local save file for you. It is definetely frustrating that you have to install extra packages and login to GFWL, which is just added hassel. Steam Works would have a been a better authentication method IMO.The game looks great and I really dig the art style. I find it weird though that when you turn on any Anti-Aialising you framerate is set to 30FPS automatically. I can play the new DOOM game at 60 FPS, so I'm puzzled by even 2X AA does this.Another thing that is annoying is that the game is set by default to allow online challengers to interupt your Arcade run. I was getting interupted non-stop until I learned I needed to turn off online challengers before I started my arcade run. I assume 99% of people just want to play arcade mode without interuptions, so why Online Challengers is on by default seems like a crappy move on Capcom's part.Now with all the all the annoyences I would say that the game is a great game if you are big Street Fighter or Tekken fan. I am a Tekken fan, and I would recommend it to those who like Tekken or Street Fighter. It is a unique fighter that has great combat and a great art style. Just be forewarned you have to jump through some hoops to get it setup on your PC."

,Recommended,209120,33270602,Posted: 5 July,all,thisnthat,"I put off buying this game for a long time because of the reviews but after some research I decided to pick up the ""Complete Pack"" during the summer sale.  I had read a few guides and suggestions beforehand so the first thing that I did before playing was to download and install this fan made patch to help with game stability.http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=649186874I chose the offline version of the patch which removes the requirement for GFWL altogether and adds the console exclusive characters like Pac-Man.  If you want to play online you will need the other version of the patch available on the same link and a GFWL account.  I do have one but I don't play online anyway so I took the trade off for the extra characters.The other thing I had to set up was my arcade stick.  A 360 controller works perfectly out of the box but unlike Ultra Street Fighter IV although it recognised my stick I couldn't configure the buttons properly and get it to save the changes because it wanted me to assign more buttons than I have.  (For the record I'm using a Dreamcast Arcade Stick and a Trio Linker Plus II adapter so your experience may be different.)To solve this I downloaded this program:https://github.com/x360ce/x360cewhich you unzip and place the contents in the game folder:Steam\Steamapps\common\Street Fighter X TekkenRun the executable and let it create the files it needs to and then it might download some configuration files for your particular controller.  You can then close the program and run the game and you should now be able to set up your button controls in game as normal.This might sound a lot of steps to take just to play the game but it's really not.  It's just a case of putting things in the right place, running two programs for a couple of seconds and then you should be good to go.One thing I will note is when I first ran the game it asked to create a new save file and it took a small ice age to do so but be patient, it will finish eventually and that only happens the first time that the game runs.As for the game itself if you've played USFIV then it will all look and feel very familiar.  Everything feels a bit louder and flashier with the soundtrack and the added effects and some of the backgrounds are a bit distracting at first because there's a lot going on back there but it's a fun twist on what you are used to from USFIV.  The feel of the game is also a little bit more jokey and fun between the characters.The game plays on a tag team system so you can switch between your two chosen characters on the fly or wait until your health is low on one and switch out to the other to finish the job.  When you do this the benched character will start regaining some of their health bar back at a slow rate so if you are having trouble that may help squeeze a little bit more life out of them.  Once you are knocked out though you are out, the other character will not run in so you have to make sure to switch before that happens.There are some differences with the moves both in what is available and how they are executed but again you will see a lot of similarities with USFIV.  There also appears to be a way to simplify the motions needed to perform a move but I haven't messed around with that but that may be a useful feature for younger players who are having trouble.  There is also the gem system which can make special moves and cancels easier to perform but again I haven't messed around with this and have just left it on the defaults for now as I'm not really one for tweaking settings and just like to dive in and play but the system is there if you want to mess around with it.I'm having great fun with it so far and I'm looking forward to messing around with the Tekken characters as I've never played the Tekken series so they should be fun to explore.  I would suggest getting the complete pack when it's on sale because it includes the 12 extra character DLC which includes Blanka who for reasons unknown is not in the base game and the 2 costume packs which even when they are on sale themselves it works out a lot cheaper to buy the whole lot in one go. So if you think you would eventually end up buyng them save a few pounds and buy the complete pack from the start."

,Recommended,209120,29001567,Posted: 4 January,all,PayShayCarl,"1989 to 2017, Street Fighter has danced along the top echelons of innovative gaming, riddled with confusing name swaps and a dedicated fan base sprawling in the competitive scene for over 20 years, known as one of the first fighting games to feature a memorable art style and one of the first to push fight sticks from the arcade onto the home market, Street Fighter has a past comparable to few others in its genre.But with all of this raises the question, where does SFXT stand among the many great titles from Capcom's senior Takashi Nishiyama, and does it deserve to hold the same name? Street Fighter X Tekken is a fun mashup title featuring the same menu and art style as SFIV, and with both the afformentioned and tight controls it would seem as if this game was to be placed near the top but that thought is squandered for two major reasons, support and multiplayer. Online fighting in this game could only be described as a chore, using the archeic Windows Live and riddled with problems after download for many users, including myself. Windows live was trying to be something it wasn't almost 10 years ago and it astonishes me that a game made in 2012 would attempt to use this buggy relic of the past and this is made even worse when trying to join a friend, having to exit out of arcade mode because someone else in your area entered it, only to wait for confirmation of it being your friend(s), or remaining in frustration at someone knocking you out of Arcade mode. This feature nearly cripples the games usability and should've featured lobbies through Steam seeing as said previously, it was created in 2012.Unless you can get the game for under 10 dollars and are willing to put up with its aggrivating set-up and multiplayer, then do not purchase. Your money would be better spent on SFIV or the 2014 title, SkullGirls, but I'm stubborn and so I'll say that even with all of this, it's still an enjoyable purchase with a solid set of mechanics and a beautiful art style that meshes well between both games cast of great characters."

But not only that, I had to install extra programs to get it to work. The saddest part is that this game really is fun, it had so much potential to be a great game. I got this game with all dlc for 10 bucks, and I wouldn't buy it for more than that. If you like fighting games, grab it when its on sale.♥♥♥♥ you Capcom, you piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥"
,Not Recommended,209120,35192064,Posted: 24 September,all,♥モノクマ♥,its taken me over a year to get this game to just run. and ive only gotten to kinda play it once and i say kinda meaning i got it to go past the title screen once now every time i try to load into the game theres a window the steam makes first that is a first time loading the game setting thing then the game loads it goes though all the title stuff and get to the title screen it says press start and i do but once i do the sound completely stops and the press start just flashes rapidly and won't do anything more. I've tried to get a refund of $5.00 butsteam says that i cant because i bought it more than 2 weeks ago even tho i have less than 1 hour of playtime on the F*¢#Ing game sometimes i really hate steam . also it's still on GFWL for some reason
