,Not Recommended,209160,7753904,"Posted: 25 November, 2013",all,Shiro,"Well, here we are again: another year, anotherCall of Duty, as the saying goes.This franchise has grown incredibly stale in the past five years or so. Infinity Ward has stuck to the same formula sinceCall of Duty 4: Modern Warfare, and as a result, almost everything inGhostsfeels dated and unimaginative.Not that some widely acclaimed aspects of said formula needed any change. For instance, the core gameplay mechanics, such as theshootingitself, still feel slick and polished.But how do you justify a 50-gigabyte installation size and the “next-gen” marketing this game received, when it looks barely nicer than stuff that was released in 2007? It’s not an ugly-looking game, sure, and the textures do look pretty good, despite what some people may say. But comparisons withBattlefield 4,Metro: Last Lightand other recent titles are inevitable, and the fact remains that everything else inGhosts, graphics-wise (lighting, particle effects, physics, etc.), is subpar.I am not one to judge a game solely on its graphical fidelity, however. The problem withGhostsis that, sans the welcome addition of the ability to practice against bots, it has no redeeming qualities to speak of.The single-player campaign is short, cliché-ridden and does not give the player any freedom. You just follow scripted orders from your “A.I.” companions, moving forward when told to and shooting enemies that pop out of hiding (when told to). It doesn’t help that the story is entirely predictable and that the voice-acting is abysmal (and since we're on the subject of audio, what can I say about the game's single, useless ""master volume"" slider in the settings menu?).But most people seem to buyCall of Dutygames for its multiplayer portion. And it too is a colossal failure. Maps are poorly designed and don’t support more than 18 players (most matches have 12 or less players). The matchmaking system is terrible: teams are completely unbalanced more often than not. There are no dedicated servers, despite Mark Rubin’s (Infinity Ward’s Executive Producer) promises prior to the game’s release. Teamwork is non-existent, as people just run in circles and shoot each other in the back to get the best possible kill-to-death ratio and unlock ridiculous, balance-breaking “killstreak” bonuses.Then there is the fact that once again, Activision will charge a good deal of money for upcoming map-packs, since not only is modding unsupported, but frowned upon.The ""new"" Extinction Mode is not even worth discussing. It is basically an uninspired rehash of Treyarch's far superior ""Zombies"" horde-mode (fromWorld at Warand theBlack Opsseries).To top it all,Ghostssuffers from a myriad of technical issues, such as glitches, crashes and framerate drops. And as a sign of Infinity Ward's everlasting ""love"" for the PC audience, there is no field-of-view slider of any kind, and a single slider for audio. Individual sliders for music, sound effects and voice communication would be too much to ask, apparently.The bottom line: don’t buy it.UPDATE (07/31/2014): I should add that, at this point (almost a year after release), the game has become nothing but a glorified DLC-selling platform, and there's effectively nothing to differentiate it from the dozens of low-quality free-to-play games on the market... except for, you know, the full entry price."

Using one of many f.o.v. changers solved this problem but, now that vac is in place, no more using it under the possibility of being banned for using something the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ devs should have put in to begin with.-Valve anti cheat. Too little, too late. This should have been implemented right from the start as many legit players left the game after nothing was being done about the rampant cheaters.Infinity Ward and Activision are content with making subpar s..t because it keeps selling. I had the chance to speak with a few of the testers for this game and asked them ""What the f..k happened?"" Their response was, ""We brought up all of the problems that we knew everyone would see and were told by the leads, ""We don't care what others will think about it. We only care that it sells.""That alone is why I will never buy another game from this scumbag of a studio and why this game gets a big ""No"" vote.Save your money. There are games several years older that are technically superior in every way to this game. Call of Duty is dead on the pc."

This is the worst CoD to date.  My experience has been nothing but continuous crashing and lagging. The patch helped a little bit but the damage was already done.  Launch day there were 35K people playing this game. Now most nights only 4K people will be on. Most of the new game type lobbies are empty and no one to play with, like Hunted.Removing the most beloved objective game modes from the game was just plain dumb. I blame Mark Rubin for creating a mess of a game. Where are the dedicated servers? Oh there arent any, they are hybrid servers supposedly but still P2P. Which means  if you have a SSD, you will more than likely be host and get shot up by those who are lagging before you see them.The leveling system is ridiculous, YOU DONT EVEN HAVE TO PLAY MP to get tokens to buy all the best weapons and perks. Simply play some Squad matches and get the tokens you need to get your Character the best weapons, perks, and attachements before even playing online versus. The leveling system should have been kept seperate from Squads and MP.The amount of hackers playing the game killed it entirely. I have given this game enough chance to know it is ruined. I do enjoy the map sizes. The maps are really incredible but the color palette  sucks.One last note. NVIDIA Geforce Experience says I can play this game on the highest settings. COD tells me to set everything to the lowest settings. This tells you there is some very poor optimization for this  game to run on PC.I give this game 2/10"

,Recommended,209160,18120811,"Posted: 20 September, 2015",all,Tom,"Okay, I'm preparing my self for this being a very unpopular review; but here goes.  Please also bare in mind that this review is purely and solely based on the single player side of the game - I will touch on the multiplayer side but only briefly.Call of Duty: Ghost is the tenth game in the COD series, and was released in 2013 on PC, PS3, Xbox 360 and Wii U, and then re-released on launch of PS4 and Xbox One.This was my first COD game that I had played in a while, so the problems people have had with the gameplay becoming stale and lack of innovation didn't effect me so much. Yes the gameplay is very much the same as all of the other Call of Duty games, however I still had fun whilst playing it. I have yet to play the multiplayer, and to be honest, I probably won't. The single player campaign follows the character of Logan Walker. You also play as Baker, Elias Walker (your father) and a new addition of playing as a combat dog, Riley.  There are no new elements to be seen in the gameplay, its very ""Call of Duty"", aim and shoot is pretty much the whole game with the odd quick time event thrown in. There are some really interesting levels when you are in space and underwater, however my favorite levels were the vehicle based ones; where you take control over tanks and helicopters - they add a little something extra to the game in my opinion, breaking up the monotony of the classic ground troop fights.Graphically, Ghosts is very dated; I was playing on 4K resolution, and it still looked very poor. Textures when close up are so low res it's hard to imagine this is a game which was released in 2013. The game uses an engine which was used in previous COD releases, but with apparent ""significant upgrades"", however I don't really see a difference in graphic fidelity in Ghosts and any of the other ""recent"" COD games.Ghost had a story which kept me interested right until the end, however I felt that the game's ending really did not do the game any justice. I really felt like I was getting a big two fingers up to me when it happened. Not sure whether people will class it as a spoiler, but the cliffhanger at the end really relies on there being a sequel in the Ghost franchise, however unlikely that will be. Up until the end though, it is a compelling story - maybe if you quit just before the end credits you'll enjoy it more!This is another game where you will not die or fail on the single player mode; you are with a squad of other characters for the majority of the game; and you could very easily just sit back and watch the fire fights if you were so inclined and you would still not fail. Even when playing on higher difficulties, there is no real ramp in the challenges on show.With the games extremely linear level design, it leaves you very little time to explore the world in front of you, that being said, there is no reason to want to either though. There are one set of ""collectibles"" to be on the look out for, and that's it - I guess it is to be expected from a COD game though. It would of been nice to maybe find little bits of extra plot and story through hacking computers, finding files etc.The single player mode took me just about seven hours to finish - I thought that was an OK length for the game;  I wasn't growing tired of the gameplay by the end of the game but there is no reason at all to play it through for a second time - expect of course if you want to play on a higher difficulty; but even then, I wouldn't say it's worth it.  Where you are going to get your mileage out of any COD game is the multiplayer - however I still don't plan on playing it simply because I am not interested in the multiplayer side of many games.Technically I didn't have any bugs or issues whilst playing. I was able to play on a steady 60 fps on 4k resolution the whole play through. At times the frame rate was even in the 100s. It certainly looks like the PC version of the game came out on top of the consoles on the technical side of things, since the consoles could barely even achieve 60 fps on lower resolutions, Xbox could only handle 720p. This game is better off being played with a keyboard and mouse, however the lack of FOV sliders did make me feel a little bit nauseous with the camera swaying around all of the time when moving. You can change this in .ini settings but in this day in age, PC games need a FOV slider as compulsory in my opinion.In conclusion, whilst there may seem to be more negatives than positives in my review for Ghosts, I did have a lot of fun whilst playing it, however the price of £39,99 is absolutely ridiculously especially for a game which has been out almost two years now.  If like me you are just going to play the single player mode, wait for the game to be around £10, but if you are going to be jumping into the multiplayer side of things (there is still a very active community out there too!) I would happily say you can pick this up for anything below £15 - since you will get the seven hour single player as well as many many hours of CODs core element, multiplayer.Tom's Score Card1) Stay away2) Only recommended when on sale3) Recommended4) Highly recommended5) This is a must playIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

,Not Recommended,209160,7754899,"Posted: 25 November, 2013",all,lehighsucks,Game is not optimized for high powered gaming rigs.  I can not even finish campaign do to the stutter. Multiplayer gameplay also suffers from framerate stutter and menu lag.  It is almost impossible to create your class in between matches dealing with  the lag in the menus.  There is no connection preferences so you will be playing with people on other continents. They even removed your ping status in match so there are no more bars or numbers telling you your latency (connection) to the server.  You can turn on the lag-o-meter in your config but that will only show the quality of the connection and not the latency.  Oh yeah and in typical IW fashion they kept the FOV option out of the game.  The only upside to this game was the bigger maps and the removal of the dual weilding machine pistols.

Now dont get my wrong there were some fun moments in the single player campain but overall it seemed to lack something that im not quite sure what is it but im sure most would agree. As for the multiplayer its fun at first with the new things to play with but it gets pretty damn boring after the first week or so because your generally doing the same thing over and over and this includes the extinction game mode, as i said at first its pretty fun but then your just doing the same thing over and over.

Cut in shortening, using pastry blender (or pulling 2 table knives through ingredients in opposite directions), until particles are size of small peas. Sprinkle with cold water, 1 tablespoon at a time, tossing with fork until all flour is moistened and pastry almost cleans side of bowl (1 to 2 teaspoons more water can be added if necessary).2) Gather pastry into a ball. Divide in half; shape into 2 flattened rounds on lightly floured surface. Wrap in plastic wrap; refrigerate about 45 minutes or until dough is firm and cold, yet pliable. This allows the shortening to become slightly firm, which helps make the baked pastry more flaky. If refrigerated longer, let pastry soften slightly before rolling.3) Heat oven to 425°F. With floured rolling pin, roll one pastry round into round 2 inches larger than upside-down 9-inch glass pie plate. Fold pastry into fourths; place in pie plate. Unfold and ease into plate, pressing firmly against bottom and side.4) In large bowl, mix sugar, 1/4 cup flour, the cinnamon, nutmeg and 1/8 teaspoon salt. Stir in apples until well mixed. Spoon into pastry-lined pie plate. Cut butter into small pieces; sprinkle over filling. Trim overhanging edge of pastry 1/2 inch from rim of plate.5) Roll other round of pastry into 10-inch round. Fold into fourths and cut slits so steam can escape. Unfold top pastry over filling; trim overhanging edge 1 inch from rim of plate. Fold and roll top edge under lower edge, pressing on rim to seal; flute as desired. Cover edge with 2- to 3-inch strip of foil to prevent excessive browning.6) Bake 40 to 50 minutes or until crust is brown and juice begins to bubble through slits in crust, removing foil for last 15 minutes of baking. Serve warm if desired."

If mouse sensitivity was consistently over/under sensitive, it's not a problem, but a couple missions it will change mid-mission, making this an annoying problem but nothing terrible.But the story and events... whew!

This review does not touch on the competitive multiplayer component.Single Player: In the fashion of the later Call of Duty games, there are incredibly long portions of each mission during which you have no control of your character, and are forced to listen to dialogue or look at scenery.The portions that you actually DO get to control your character are so narrow, linear, and short, that they are hardly worth mentioning. While there are some neat moments, they only appear once, briefly during the campaign, making it feel like a string of set pieces.As for the story, it is laughable and unbelievable. I'd say it breaks the immersion, but the game never even lets you get immersed in the first place. I found myself not being able to relate to any of the characters, or finding any of them sympathetic. I'm also not sure if anyone vetted the absurd dialogue before recording it.Extinction: Aliens made it into Call of Duty! This mode can be fun, if you have a competent team. There is no tutorial on the mechanics of this mode, so seeing new people running around, making things harder, can be difficult to watch sometimes. It can be brutally hard for new players, or teams with new players. It is nice in that it does not have the completely random feel of the competitive multiplayer, but is not just a string of set pieces and cutscenes like the campaign.Overall: Ghosts plays like a bad action movie, and there is even less gameplay here than previous installments."

The main menu/options screen freezes randomly and has happened to many peoples systems, both Intel and AMD, no matter how good your hardware may be it doesn't seem to matter. While I haven't had the issue, I know many others have crashing/stuttering issues in-game as well.Well lets get into some pros & cons about the game.Campaign:+Pros:-Cons:- Story is possibly the weakest of all Call of Duty's- Voice acting is god awful and cringeworthy- Slow and dull, the 4 hour campaign makes it feel twice as long with half the fun as the older usual campaigns in comparison- A step backwards from Black Ops II, no custom loadouts, no side missions, no choices to be made.- Fish A.I doesn't seem to work all the time :/- The dog 'Riley' they advertised so much is hardly in the campaign. Maybe 3-4 levels total and completely irrelevant.Multiplayer+Pros:+ Gunplay is good as usual+ Plenty of soldier customization this time around, including female soldiers.+ A far better gun and attachment unlock system+ Improved prestige system+ Kill time is faster which I enjoy a lot more.+ Larger maps which I liked but some may not+ New game modes are fun but unpopulated-Cons:- Rank grindings take much longer- Unlocking soldier customization can be a pain-Spawn system is terrible- Less than a month after release and Multiplayer lobbies are nearly empty- New game modes are fun but unpopulatedOverall:+Pros:+ Graphics look fairly nice on ultra, a bit better than Black Ops II but nothing too amazing+ Gun sounds are good+ Gamepad support-Cons:- Volume options lacking- Lack of dedicated servers- No FoV slider or mouse smoothing on/off- Extinction game mode is rather boring (I don't like horde game modes usually including nazi zombies)Game is rather average a 6.5/10 rating seems accurate for this title.You may have fun with this game but be weary you may end up wasting money."
,Not Recommended,209160,9776408,"Posted: 9 April, 2014",all,Vesmight,"The most recent installment of the Call of Duty franchise, and without a doubt, the greatest farce offered up by Activision in this series yet. This was the first Call of Duty I ever played on PC and seeing how it played out, there was no reason to buy it when I did (or for that matter, ever). I can say for certain that following this, I willnoteven do so much as consider purchasing another Call of Duty title on PC developed by Infinity Ward. Some games as well as previous Call of Duty titles are meant to be more user friendly and developed around  lower end systems to pass on on graphical fidelity and instead aim for a more mechanics driven experience. Call of Duty Ghosts delivers neither of those two and instead falls on its stupid masked face.Upon launch of the game back in 2013, it was a poor excuse for a console port to PC. No FoV options, pitiful graphics while consuming obscene amounts of system horsepower while running terribly, ridiculous system requirements (seriously, you need 50GB of my disk space for this rubbish?), gun play that feels ""meh"" at best, and God awful multiplayer level design.I'll admit, there are some interesting aspects. It's nice to see the ""Pick 10"" system stillsomewhatin place, but not nearly as well designed as Treyarch's version. Certain weapons coming with integrated attachments is a neat thing, albeit with a rather narrow selection of weapons to choose from. Though this doesn't help that the aforementioned gun play is rather boring, and no gun I ever tried had significantoomphto it to make me feel as if I am using more than some dinky airsoft gun from a corner store.All that sounds bad for the most part, I know. But you know what sounds worse? The actual game. Call of Duty Ghosts has no doubt, the absoluteWORSTsound design in any shooter I have ever played. It's absolutely pathetic. Half the guns seem to sound the same, and I wouldn't mind that if they at least had some depth to the sound. But every gun sounds like you put a rock in a tin can and shook it around! In fact, that would sound BETTER than half the guns in this abysmal game.You know what else is bad? The level design for multiplayer. I don't know what they were thinking with the pacing of the maps, but I'm pretty sure their minds were obscured by a bit of LSD. The flow of combat in the maps is terrible, and movement feels sluggish and boring. Back in MW2, the movement speed was perfect for the map size and the maps were the right size to begin with. But now we're constantly being given tiny maps compared to what used to be the norm, and to make sure you can't do a lap of them in five seconds you now move painfully slow. Not to mention the maps are organized in a way that makes as much logical sense as using molasses as libricant in your car's engine. And I hope you don't mind respawning within 15 meters of an enemy at all times thanks to the awful spawning system.Now, the Extinction mode. I'll admit, it looks kinda cool. One of the better co-op experiences done by Infinity Ward for sure, and for the Call of Duty franchise it's certainly something new. But is it a good new? Eh... I'll leave that up to the individual to decide. If I'm going into a co-op shooting gallery, aliens aren't high up on my list of preferred bullet pin cushions. Though I'll award a few pity points for trying to do something with this game in at least one category.On the subject of the Single Player... I'll admit, I didn't touch it. Let's face it, year after year, people buy into Call of Duty for the multiplayer. If I want a lush and deep single player game, I'll look to a game that is designed around the concept of a blissful single player experience. Knowing how this game is though, I can imagine that the campaign was rather lackluster at best if not a poor excuse for a tacked on side game mode for when you ragequit the online multiplayer. And Squads? I'm just gonna ignore that... It falls within the realm of the online multiplayer, and that mode is a joke in just about every regard.So in conclusion; this game is not worth your time or your dollars, euros, rubles, or freaking Dogecoins if you somehow managed to obtain this game using them. The game runs poorly, simple features that should have been present at launch were not to be seen, the game looks like a dated console port that has way too much brown in the colour pallete, the multiplayer is the worst experience to date, the sound in game is nearly gag worthy,and morewhile taking up FIFTY GIGABYTES of your monthly internet bandwidth and 50GB of space on your hard drive. It's a waste of space, a waste of time, and a waste of money. Want a good PvP shooter experience? Go buy Titanfall! If you don't want to use Origin's service (I don't blame you there), and you still want to go buy something... Go buy six copies of Goat Simulator and gift five of them to your friends. They will love you for it. Otherwise, avoid this game like the bubonic plague.Game Rating: 3.5/10"

Graphically, Ghosts looks on par if not worse than Modern Warfare 3 and somehow manages to run terribly. And why can I play the campaign on near max settings but have to revert to the lowest in the multiplayer? I don't know and I don't think IW does either.The singeplayer campaign is nothing special, a mish-mash of the worst parts of Modern Warfare and Black Ops 2 with a healthy dose of even less ""innovation"" and proper storytelling and emotion than any Call of Duty game before it. The only new things this game even manages to bring to the table are the contextual lean (something not even needed on the PC version) and the freakin' dog they hyped up so much that proves to be just as much of a lame gimmick pre as post-release.And the multiplayer - the one aspect that convinced most to crack open their wallets every year - is HORRENDOUS.Aside from the aforementioned oddity with the online portion's graphics, all the maps save one or two are ill-designed and way too big for this kind of multiplayer game, you'll find yourself spawning amongst enemy teammates more than once a match, as of two weeks ago (when I stopped playing altogether) IW had yet to nail down hacks and exploits, the kill streak system feels gutted and useless, and the ranking/unlock system is so unnecessarily convoluted that even Call of Duty veterans will have to fumble around the menus, within menus, within menus before figuring it out.Call of Duty: Ghosts is just a less than mediocre showing from the series and unless you absolutely, positively need your new COD fix take a pass on this one and see if next year's installment looks or is any better."

Less than 10 hours of game play is not an experienced opinion. At 110 hours, expectations that I had for the improvement of this game have all but evaporated. After noticing that my submissions for major improvements over hacking, a failed Clan War system, and more were answered on average 10+ days later, I was compelled to write this review.Game Balance = FailClan Wars = FailGraphics = FailAdministration = FailSingle Player = WinExtinction = WinSquad = WinTranslation: Co-op and single player modes are awesome. Multiplayer plays like it was developed by the same contractors that were building the building that collapsed in advance of the Brazil Olympics.CLAN WARS:Clan Wars should have saved this game, and in fact, there was an uptick in players logging in. But as soon as the boosting and the exploiting started, despite the many posts, the admins failed to respond.OVERALL MAJOR BUGS:In addition to the terrible balancing of games, the FPS and Memory for PC is all over the place. There is a huge mem leak at this time of my review, and how many weeks after release is this?  How things like these made it into a tested game is unacceptable, and people should be accountable/lose their jobs.Ping balance- you will play against people from the farthest reaches of the world, with both of you changing places for smooth to sloggy game play. There seems to be a problem with the way the game throttles and balances individual connectivity. Along with that, I dont understand how it makes sense to pair your lobby in the US with FR, Poland, and etc...unless they are just having a really hard time matching games....because...at 9pm PST the other night the entire system had less than 5,000 players.....RAMPANT CHEATINGA poorly admined game that requires you to play on their servers means that they will fix what they want when they want. Call of Duty will never be free of hacking and cheats, but this is by far the worst administered game ever.From my experience and for my opinion, this is the worst online game I have ever bought. I wish refunds were possible."

This game overall is spectacular. I own it on PS4 and I love it especially the extinction mode. Campaign was phenomenal, the new extinction mode was so addicting and awesome. Multiplayer was decent and fun with the dlc's such as becoming Michael Myers and the Predator by doing the field order challenges. I still enjoy this game to this day on the PS4 and wanted to carry on the same experience to the PC to play with my PC buds.Unfortunately this is such a terrible PC port. It's performance overall is mediocre. It runs good for me but lacks gamepad overall even with keybinding since it moves completely slow and the same to look around. I tried using my wired 360 xbox controller which works like a charm on my other games and it seems like the game has partial support for gamepads overall. I even tried using my PS4 and Xbox controller on ScpServer and Xpadder and none of these seemed to work. I know I have no issues with Xpadder cause I can play CoD4 with my controller without a problem. A great game overall and great development for the consoles, but poor development for the PC. I also tried to verify integrity of the game's cache and optimizing it on my nvidia geforce experience as my last resort to see if that would improve it's performance and nothing. It's quite a shocker cause I have games like Battlefield 4 and Titanfall both with higher specs and works flawlessly and I even had Advanced Warfare at one point and was running very well. However, I do recommend the game for the console versions only. DO NOT waste your money for the PC version. You've been WARNED!! They would need to come up with a major update for the PC to fix the whole game to bring it back to life and to fully operate how it should to be able to recommend it. Otherwise, it's just NOT worth it. I'm so upset and I want my money back."

The amount of detail that went into the levels was staggering, and the large maps in multiplayer cater to new gameplay styles.

I have purchased virtually every new release--whether from Treyarch or IW--with the almost sole intention of playing multiplayer. Sadly, Ghosts is where I stop; this is indisputably the last COD I will ever purchase.Why? It's simple: the developers' blatant disregard for online playability, neglect (or perhaps unwillingess) to ramp up anti-hack measures/ban cheaters, and complete inability to optimize the game for computers of varying capabilities all serve to undermine the integrity of the entire COD franchise.First, in online multiplayer on PC, there are hardly ANY players online. The only two game modes you're guaranteed to find matches in are TDM and Domination. What's the point in having all the cool niche game modes if there aren't enough players online using them?Okay, so let's look at the cause-effect: why aren't there any players online? It really comes down to two main reasons. The first is that the game is poorly optimized, and is consequently only playable by those with top-tier PCs. ""Just decrease the visual settings"", you suggest? Ah, if we purchase a game for $60, should we really have to downgrade the quality settings to play it? No. The developers are generating millions of profit at significant margins; why should WE have to compromise game quality when they have the means and resources to optimize the game to ensure playability for a diversity of consumers?Fortunately, I have a high-performing PC and do not experience (the majority) of the lag/fps issues that most complain about. Instead, my biggest issue and disappointment is the ridiculous prevalance of hackers. There are AT LEAST 2-3 hackers in almost every single online match. If you take the time to watch killcams of many top-scoring players, a pathetically high number of them are, quite conspicuously, aiming at you through walls/map barriers. Some are even stupid enough to SHOOT you through walls, even regardless of whether you have all stealth perks active or not (i.e. blind eye, incog, off the grid).I understand COD is a franchise especially prone to hacking--that's fine, that's to be expected. However, the sheer influx of hackers in COD: Ghosts is just completely sad. Of the 5-6 different COD chapters I've played, this is bar-none the worst for hacking. It is quite evident that Activision/IW/whoever's responsible for anti-hack measures have completely floundered. Until cheaters begin to get caught and banned (which likely won't be for a LONG while), I assuredly will not be playing much. In its current state, the quality of online gameplay is shameful, and yields a considerably frustrating experience for those who want to play fairly and legitimately."

This game is the worst creation known to man, it's been moved from the consoles to pc, and they've done such a terrible job. They can't even optimize it so a menu doesn't have fps lag, even on the lowest settings. Let alone have a good fps in a match. The Call of Duty series has yet again been proved to be a cash cow and nothing else, these games should be a peice of art, not something that is unplayable. The single player campaign was just the same as all of the other Call of Duty's, just run and pull the trigger at anything that moves, some may find this bareable, and this is not the main flaw in this game. The main flaw is the multiplayer,I've spent more time trying to connect to the online serices than I have actually played on mulitplayer, and i'm sure it's not my interent as Black ops 2 works straight away. Once I do manage to get online, I can't bare to play more than five minutes, bullets don't seem to hit people, there's a lot of fps lag and all of the features such as dynamic maps just aren't really there.To conclude I feel that this is the biggest waste of money ever, if you want a Call of Duty game, I would suggest Black Ops 2 or MW2, DO NOT WASTE MONEY ON GHOSTS.I would rate this game 1/10, it's barely playable."

I should be using the ""I'm not even mad, that's amazing"" meme here, but the problem is i'm both really frustrated and amazed. What is amazing is also what's frustrating, and it is how a team as large as Infinity Ward, with as much money as Activision gives them, can produce a game that just plainly sucks so bad. I mean, its incredible, really. When a game is unplayable at launch, unplayable a week after launch, and just barely playable (but still not fun) almost a half year after launch, you are doing something wrong. People saying it doesn't feel like Call of Duty are right, because CoD is a game. This doesn't feel like a game, it feels like an infinite rage generator. </rant>Graphics:-Nothing special, especially considering its optimized so poorly that you would need a titan just to run it at medium settings. -It literally runs worse than crysis, but without coming near the same graphics level.Gameplay:-Such lag, much delay, so teleport-That is all-Well, no, that is not all:-You die too fast, why does every gun have the damage of a Barret the recoil of the MW3 ACR?-IED, its like a claymore fused with a bouncing betty, then given steroids, and its anoying for everyone.-UAV, you broke it, nuff said-Don't ever make people rely on a mobile app to do stuff you otherwise can't do in-game. The whole clan wars thing is kinda cool, but to everyone who doesn't have one of the few phones your app supports, it's rubbish. Also, the app is just as poorly optimized as the game, it runs like crap, lags a lot, and bugs all over the place.-KEM in a care package? Who decided that was a good idea? My guess is some 12 year old kid who doesn't know how to play and just wants some easy kills...-The new prestieging system is a nice try, but a miss in my opinion. I like the Black Ops 2 system a lot more.-Squad points, you just get them here and there, there is no acomplishment in unlocking anything.-You added the 3-way split killstreak system back:D But you broke specialist, since the last killstreak is no longer all of them-Talking about specialist, why are there so many perks? More =/= betterSound:-Finally something slightly positive, kinda, maybe, not really-The sound whoring (positional sound, for those who don't know) works, really well, but that doesn't matter because the game is already lagging so much it doesn't matter if you know someone is behind a corner. Its kinda like having nice wheels on a car, but the car is missing its engine.-The guns all sound like nailguns....DLC:-Really?-Wow-That is just asking for it. Why the heck would anyone want to throw away more money at a game that is already broken. Wolf skin, Cpt. Price skin, and so on, maybe you should have focused on fixing the game insteaf of making an extra 10 bucks off the 5 people acually buying it.-Can't speak for the map pack DLC's as i have not wasted my precious money on them, but they are most likely alright. What bugs me about the DLC's is how they focused on DLC instead of fixing the broken game. (you don't spend your money adding a new TV to your house, if the roof is missing do you?)Enjoyment:-None to be found-Like, at all-Even getting a kill or a killstreak just feels random and unrewardingAll in all:1/10 I mean, at least the game starts up, that all it gets a point for, being able to start.PS.

Crashes, FPS drops, bugs and laggs arent rare at all...4.The System Requirements are insane and indefensible5.There are not enough people in the un-popular modes, so you will have to play TeamDeathMatch or Domination most of the time.

The gamestyle is good.2. If you havent played CoD before, buy it now! You are missing the best FPS experience at all times!3.This game goes good with friends: You play, you laugh, you enjoy.

The Extinction mode is unique, you wont find it anywhere else.

Jumping around and knifing everyone, using choices of weapons and attachments that don't make the game enjoyable for you, and people overall just ruin the game experience for you. The graphics are unmatched compared to what Battlefield 4 has to offer. Unfortunately, Battlefield 4 isn't avaliable on Steam , and I wish it was. The graphics in this game are absolutely horrible, unless you are on the highest setting. If you are on a lower setting than 'Extra' when it comes to texture quality, the game doesn't look good and the camos won't even look like camos! It still locks you at 30 FPS too! In conclusion, never buy an Infinity Ward Call of Duty, and wait for Treyarch or Sledgehammer to make a game that will actually be good.

But I do not recommend this game to those who don't have it yet.Paradoxal, isn't it ? Let me explain why :I was a fan of MW3 and, of course, I decided to buy this game, specially for clan wars. Now that I have it, I play it. It would be a waste of money not to play and I want to achieve all the goals in clan war before i quit playing this game. But for those who don't have it yet, I want to inform them about all the things that could disapoint them.1) You need a very good PC to run it : I mean, even Battlefield 4 runs better than Ghosts ! And... it is not more beautiful than other COD games. Battlefield 3 or Crysis 1 's graphics are still better ! This is not my own opinion, this is the opinion of many players. So, if you want to play this game, prepare yourself to pay a lot for a new graphic card, etc.2) map packs are not worth it : they are expensive and nobody plays it. Specially because new maps are not mixed with old ones. Because everyone is playing the old ones, it's getting harder and harder to find people to play on the new maps. For example : the free fall map was exclusively reserved for players who pre-ordered the game. ""They"" finally had to make it free and playable for everyone because ABSOLUTELY NOBODY was playing it ! Season pass is not worth it too, because it does not even include coolest stuffs (and sometimes very useful ones) such as extra slots for loadouts, wolf skin for the dog, or captain price skin.3) because fewer and fewer players are playing it, it is already more and more difficult to find players to play with. Only TDM and Domination are still played enough. Specially for clan wars, this lack of players will be a big problem.4) clan war is a total failure. Because I was getting bored shooting on noobs when I was playing MW3, I got very excited when I heard about clan wars coming on Ghosts. I thought it would be a good occasion to meet and fight against best players, to participate to some kind of online competition. Good thing when you don't have the occasion to play in LAN or in real LAN tournaments. But Clan war is nothing like that. You don't fight other clans, you play as usual and the competition only counts the number of victories. The clan that gets the most victories during a certain time wins. So, clan war is just a ""who will kill the most noobs"" competition. Except for diamond division, it is even a "" who will not sleep "" competition (because clans who sleep the less will, of course, play more and get more victories. Clan war is the most disapointing part of this game.5) Hackers were a big problem. Every day, every night, there was at least one hacker every 4 or 5 matches. ""They"" finally reacted and banned tons of them. But it was too late. Now, because of those massive bans, it's even more difficult to find players to play with. They should have made a system like : warnings first, then punitions like stats reset, and then Ban.Morality : For those who have this game already, let's continue to enjoy playing it. The community is small on Steam, but we can still have fun. But for those who don't have it yet, please think twice. specially about the cost of this game, because it will include the upgrade of your PC (if you don't have a decent and very recent one). And, as mentionned above, the second biggest problem is the fact that less and less players are playing it, for all the reasons I explained : tons of good players who quit playing because of the cheaters, then, tons of cheaters who got banned, technical needs : not everyone can afford a so good PC for the moment, map packs that are dividing the community even more, and, last but not least : many players who leave for other good games such as BF4, Titan Fall,... and even old cod like MW3 (many of my friends went back to mw3) etc.Best regards.(Post Scriptum : I had a GTX 580, and I had to upgrado to GTX 780 to run it fully)"

I also like the special events and how clanwars work. It is just sad that it only works with an app and that there is no other solution to it. But these are just small issues I have. A big downside is: It is full of hackers and it feels like nothing has been done about it. There is no real Anti-Cheat solution right now and that influences the game experience heavily. It is a fact that nowadays a lot of people try to break games to make it easier to achieve things and brag about it.

I have a pretty powerful gaming rig that can run almost anything maxed out at 60+ FPS. This game, however, brings it down to its knees. Its unbelievable !!! Even the MAIN MENU stutters!!!! Even at 1280 x 720 medium settings, frame rate will sometimes drop below 40, leading to many unfair deaths. And dont get me started on graphics quality. Even at 1080p with all the bells and whistles turned on, the game looks like♥♥♥♥♥♥ Everything is colorless, washed out and textures lack detail. A game with such outdated graphics should frankly be able to run at 120 FPS -  on your laptop's integrated graphics ... LMFAO!! IW didnt seem put any effort into optimizing this junk.Aside from horrible graphics and lag issues, multiplayer gameplay itself has taken a turn for the worse. Maps are gigantic with little thought given to design and actually polishing them for competitive/objective gameplay. You can get shot from hundred different directions at any time..and the color scheme makes it difficult to spot enemies.... its a total mess. ARs dominate every other category due their good hipfire spread coupled with map size and insanely fast times to kill. In Previous COD games, skilled players had time to react and find cover and actually fight back after getting shot first. NOT HERE. If enemies see you first and start shooting .. YOU WILL DIE!! AND THERES NOTHING YOU CAN DO ABOUT IT.! In terms of Game modes, I actually like the fact that domination Capture points are set-up in a triangular fashion on most maps. Makes it harder to spawn trap. TDM and Domination are in fact the only game types worth playing, because they got rid of many of the classic games modes !!! Where is Demolition ?? Where is Hardpoint ? And What on earth happened to Capture the Flag ( my personal favorite) ?They have somehow managed to suck every last bit of fun out of this once great franchise. And I'm saying this as someone who has played and loved every COD game since COD4:Modern Warfare. Heck , even put in nearly 1000 hours in MW3 and Blops2, both of which I thoroughly enjoyed. After playing blops2, i was actually rather excited for Ghosts. But 30 hours in, and man am I disappointed! .....I am angry at myself for falling for the hype. Angry for spending $119.99 on the hardened edition pre-order. Should have known better."

The singleplayer is bad, but the multiplayer is fun to jump into now and then and doesn't require much thought or strategy. It's the kind of game that you can jump into for a short amount of time and stop playing whenever you want. Camping is a big problem in this game however, which might ruin some players' experiences. You might encounter some hackers but it's quite easy to report them.Back to the campaign, the story is ridiculous and is hard to follow (not really worth it anyway). Basically all of South America invades the US by shooting it with giant missiles from space... you get the point. That being said, it is still fun to occasionally control some ridiculous weapon attached to a helicopter to mow down tons of enemies.The real reason I wouldn't recommend this game on PC is the how bad the port is. The graphics don't look much better than the console version. Framerates aren't good either. It dips below 30 fps on my rig (which gets around 50 fps in Battlefield 4, a far better looking game). There's one attachable sight that makes the game go to around 5 fps (not intentionally). To conclude, if you do want to get this game, get it on a console."

The single player is 4-7 hours long, depending on your skill level, and is full of the same trite bull.  It's a glorified shooter-on-rails.  Put, click, and shoot.The multiplayer portion of the game is what really ruins the game, in my opinion, however.  It's buggy as hell, for starters, and lag seems to be an issue no matter how decent a connection every player in a given lobby has.  To boot, as with every CoD game in the last decade, hackers make their appearances in droves.  The difference with Ghosts, however, is that no one is doing a damn thing about it.  Within the first three months of Ghosts, it's already as shabby and hacked-apart as MW3 was in it's last months.  Steam doesn't do anything about it (and why should they, it's not their game), and Activision has, once again, put aside the pleas of its fans and left out any sort of hacker control.  No votekick, no PunkBuster, nothing.  For any legitimate players, your choices soon dwindle down to playing against Bots, which have neither skill nor allows for any real EXP gain.The most frustrating factor to me, however, is how terribly the servers are.  First, we never really got those dedicated servers that were promised before launch, did we? No, all we got was this terrible hybrid system that disallows for any control over who and where you play.  Even worse, though, is that, because you have no way to look for servers, you're stuck, just as in MW3, waiting for a lobby to find enough players to launch.  For sometimes as much as half an hour at a time.Ultimately, Ghosts is a tired and vain game, with nothing new or fun to offer its players.  Don't make the mistake that I made: don't buy Ghosts."

Yes, they've made a few cool changes to the perk-system but honestly once you get used to that, you realize that the perks you can choose are pretty much the same.The second largest problem is their way of designing maps in multiplayer. In the older games (here I think mainly of MW1 and MW2) the multiplayer maps were taken right out of the campaign and put into multiplayer to be used in different game-types. For players like myself, who loved playing both the campaign and the multiplayer that gave the maps a kind of ""homely"" feeling. The maps back then had better design and felt more intuitive.As I see it they've run out of ideas and have begun running in circles instead, just destroying a once good formula for a game."

At least not at the price they are asking since this COD has been the biggest failure for PC ever. I pre ordered this game and have tried playing both single and multi players. I liked the single player but the multiplayer is a piece of crap. The maps on the highest settings are not really graphic at all, Frame rates drop on you all the time, Ping bar is missing so you can't even tell if you are lagging because of your connection to ping due to it not even being there, Spawns are horrible, and i mean horrible i have had soo many times where my enemy spawns no more than 2 feet beside me, i am not joking. Map layouts are horrible and i still have not even had a mp match on the supposed free fall map which i did try out by myself in private match and found that map not to even be half what was promised. There are no servers at all only quickmatches by activision. Also when you try to find a match you are lucky to even find 15 lobbies on a good day in TDM. I am serious, i rememeber MW3 BO2 all of these had 60+ lobbies to join well into their life. Even now i can open MW3 and find more quickmatch lobbies for TDM then i can find in COD Ghost. Ghost was a joke, They have fixed ram issues and several boot up issues but the gameplay issues are still the same.If any of you were expecting the gameplay to be anything like the modern warfare series, then you are in for a surprise. It is what i would call a half breed between the MW series and the BO series. People bought this because they wanted MW series type of gameplay. Others buy BO series because they like that better. Well this one mixed both and it is rotton horrible. If Infinity ward doesn't fix this game then i will skip CODs from here on till i find another proven good one. I am looking forward to ""Enemy Front"" and ""Homefront 2"" by Crytek. Well this is the end of my review of this game and i really hope they fix these issues because i paid $60 pre order for nothing. I still play more MW3 than i do in this game."

But it is unfortunate that a company on the level of Infinity Ward can mess up so much on a PC port of their game, the platform that their foundation is built on. I am somewhat sympathetic for them since they did have to create next gen versions of the game as well, on a two year development time, but I draw the line when they make a PC version that is sometimes almost unplayable, in multiplayer atleast. The single player portion runs great for me, all of my setting can be put at the highest, and the game truely looks good. I really enjoyed the single player, I liked the new characters and the whole concept of this small team of so called Ghosts. The storyline was also a refreshing break from the last 3 Modern Warfare games, which is nice. Unfortunately, multiplayer is a different story. The framerate and stuttering are ridiculous at times, leaving the game virtually unplayable at times, forcing you to lower your settings and possibly even the resolution to smooth out the gameplay experience. It feels like a mediocre company ported the multiplayer, while IW did the single player, they almost feel like to completely different games from a graphical and technical standpoint. This is a shame considering that the engine this game runs on is 10 years old, and they make these high requirements for this game that could easily be run on a decently powered PC. Although I do have fun with the multiplayer, and Extinction mode is all kinds of fun, I would say that you should wait to see if Infinity Ward patches things in the near future, or wait for the price to go down drastically.-Brandon"

I am a Call of Duty fan. I have been a fan since Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare, but this game may be the game that stops me from purchasing another Call of Duty. This game's PC version was poorly executed, and if this is the treatment I expect to get with future titles, you can forget it Activision. To start with, I have a fairly nice machine. I can run Skyrim on the highest graphical settings with HD graphical mods with excellent FPS, but I have to run Call of Duty: Ghosts at a medium setting because of how utterly poorly optimized this game is. Graphics are not everything, but they are an important part and in this respect Call of Duty fails. It's ""revolutionary graphics"" looks pretty much the same as other titles in the franchise. On to the gameplay (when the game decides to let your machine play), it's not bad. It's a pretty decent ARCADE SHOOTER. This game is not in any way meant to be realistic, and if you come into the franchise on that assumption you are wrong. The upgrading and leveling system is pretty nice, but nothing spectacular. The game hardly improves from it's predecessors. Not the mention, Activision insists on its horrible ""Hardened Editions"" or DLC models.

Oh, and not to mention getting eaten by a damn shark!I found Black Ops 2 single player experience a better one overall, but if you like CoD you'll enjoy this well enough.  Ghosts took me about 6 hours to complete.  That's about the norm for CoD games.  The main villain of this game was boring and nothing ever made you care about saving the day, but instead just saving some HDD space.I did run into a few crashes during my playthrough.  Most of which took place while in the jungle.  Not sure if it was my rig not being all juiced up on steroids or the games crappy optimization for PC's.  Cutscenes tend to skip in audio ALL the time.  This was not due to my PC.  I've seen many newer rigs having this issue as well.  Then finally, the game crashed at the very end of the game after I beat it for no reason.  Had to reboot so I could get the beat the game achievement.  Silly.Want more CoD action then here you go.  More of the same as always though.  Buy on discount of course.  Stay Frosty."

I may not have very many hours in single player as you can tell, but I have 430+ hours in multiplayer. This game was the first CoD I ever owned, and I was impressed. The graphics are honestly the best in a CoD game I have ever seen, and the maps are highly detailed. There is quite a nice variety of weapons, and I like the perk system for how unique it is. If you want a more battlefield-like experience with much bigger maps and high detail, this is the CoD for you. It is too bad that not that many people play it anymore, however."

Not that it's praise-worthy, but still, such bashing.Well, it's Call of Duty - whaddya expect ? If you've played any title since the first Modern Warfare, you already know what you're getting into. In the end, it's a pretty refined (gameplay-wise) MP experience, and not much else.On MultiplayerStill that crappy matchmaking, but some of the larger maps I've seen in CoD's history with smaller teams creates a better experience than tight arenas full of people. I've been spending a lot more time skulking around looking for people, and I'm pretty mobile. Nothing much new with the guns except for more balance than previous titles - you no longer see everyone running the same OP setup.I liked the new customization system better than BO 2 Pick Ten - you can remove secondaries to have more perks, and you're free to mix and match the perks to your liking, with the potential to create unique classes. Of course that potential is hindered by the fact that it's mostly perks you've seen before, and that a lot of them are pretty useless (Takedown removes the symbol that hangs in the air for the enemy team where you got a kill, which is meaningless in hardcore, Resilience removes fall damage which seems a bit random anyways, with not a lot of high drops ingame ANYWAY, Extra Lethal or Tactical - Scavenger should allow you to replenish grenades. But I digress.)The maps are pretty boring, I can't say that I really enjoy any of them, while I do hate the verticality and openness of some. But that's probably 'cause I'm a stoner that doesn't think. That ''dynamic map'' map thing, could've been a lot more interesting. One map can be radically transformed, another can be filled with smoke for 30 seconds, one has occasional earthquakes, but other than that ? It's pretty much opening or closing doors. AMAZING !!! Not.The new lean ability is pretty cool, but seems a bit broken, not engaging when you'd think it would or vice-versa, sometimes exposing you too much automatically. But my mouse is old and abused, the clicks sometimes misfire, so maybe I'm just having more trouble there than most. The slide to crouch while sprinting, is a bit hard to control, sometimes taking you too far or not enough, but it can be useful.The new kill streak system though, is very balanced, and a lot less lethal then before. Well not really, but most of them do require tactical thinking and skill to use effectively, in the Assault class anyways. I'll say this though - I own an 60 pound husky, and it would definitely not take more than 10 bullets to put him down. The Support stuff is cute but most people will eventually resort to the 3-4 truly useful, like the Support Troop or the Oracle. I used to love Specialist in MW3 FFA, but somehow I don't feel like using it anymore, so I can't really comment on that, other than higher priced perks require more kills, so you'll find yourself using low-tier perks to get to your bonus. Which kinda sucks. It makes the difference between achieving the bonus at 8 kills (with a low-tier perk ladder) or 13-14-15 (with a better perk ladder). MehChallenges ! To unlock useless but pretty patchs and titles ! Unlike previous games, now there's only a handful of them active at a time. You may have gotten 1000 kills using the red dot sight, but if the challenge wasn't active, tough ♥♥♥♥♥♥s. It is possible to change active challenges by spending 1 squad point (the currency of MP, of which you'll earn a handful per game) but since it's randomized ... It's not great. In my opinion all challenges should be active at all time. This is just an artificial way of lenghtening the unlocking process. Booo !On SquadsDo you enjoy camping ? Good. The terrible AI constantly swarming you will make sure you can sit in a corner, sights trained on the door, shooting baddies as they come in. Until they start becoming total bullet sponges, needing more than what you have in a magazine to take down. I played a dozen games in different modes, with friends, random, and solo, and haven't been back.On SingleplayerWait. Wait ... waaaaaaaaait ... Ok, go here. Kill (again, terrible AI). Ok, go there. Sit through an incredibly bombastic, over the top action sequence. Go there. Waaaaaaaaaait ... Kill. I might be stoned outta my mind, but this is incredibly boring. I got through the middle of the campaign in about 3 hours and haven't been back. Btw, I've finished EVERY CoD on Veteran except BO 2. And I couldn't finish the campaigne here.On ExtinctionMOOOOOOOO !!! MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO !!!Zombies worked out great. This is a copy paste but with aliens. Then why is it so freakin boring ? Hives are take forever to destroy (again, artificial lengthening). Enemies are TOTAL bullet sponges especially end-game. Guns are totally boring - you just need high damage output with the less reloading possible, so LMG it is. Maybe AR if you're feeling brave. Upgrading them is a cool idea - but totally luck based. This needs a lot of teamwork - maybe including a chat box in the lobby would help making sure everyone has complementary equipment. You complete challenges to get bonus skill points - but randoms will more often than not completely ignore them or actively fail at them, leaving you underpowered at end game. Speaking of which, there isn't much ways to complete it except deploying automated sentries everywhere and that kind of game mechanic abuse. Oh yeah, reloading - you're ALWAYS reloading. Have a full clip of armor-piercing round and refill your inventory from a dropped box ? RELOAD. ALL YOUR GUNS. You're shooting so much, quasi non stop in fact, that you run out pretty quickly. Better hope the guy with the armor-percing rounds drops some eh ? You get the idea.PerformanceSurprisingly, the game runs flawlessly on my system, and has since day 1.i7-2670QMGT 555M8 GB RAMI do play it windowed (no borders) at 1366x768 instead of my usual 1920x1080, but that's just my mid-to-high gaming laptop from 2011 showing it's age. Still, no downscaling and extra textures, though I do turn the anti-aliasing to a minimum and cut most effects. Which are pretty ugly anyways. Motion blur ? Bloom ? Nvidia special hair ? Please. I enjoy games, and this one runs consistenly at a good FPS, does not crash, and alt-tab's without a hitch."

,Not Recommended,209160,8031151,"Posted: 13 December, 2013",all,Humblebee,"(I apologize in advance for spelling and grammar mistakes, english is not my first language)When it comes to Call of Duty, I kinda lost interest after Modern Warfare 3. Black Ops 2 still held up and I thought to myself that let's see if IW can top Treyarch with the latest CoD. As it turns out, Call of Duty: Ghosts may be the worst purchase I have made this year.Let's start off with 6-7 hour single player. The story itself is ridiculous. It barely makes any sense and a majority of the characters are bland and completely forgettable. It's usually a bad sign when I actually want most of the good guys to die a horrible painful death. On top of the story and lame characters the game is littered with quick time events, a game concept I absolutely hate if used in the wrong way. I can understand a QTE every now and then and if they're done well. In this game, they slow the game down and it feels like a chore every time one pops up. If we need to jump out of a helicopter to start the stage, the game can do it for us. If we need to rappel up onto a catwalk, I don't want to hold 'F' to do it. It breaks the immersion from the game and you don't feel accomplished when it's done. It's literally ""Push button, you are winner!"". No thought and very boring. And where did the branching storyline from Black Ops 2 go? It may have not been anything new in games, but it was new and interesting in CoD as a series. But nope, IW needs to be as arrogant as possible when it comes to expanding upon things made by Treyarch. IW, you can advertise your single player for having a writer who has won multiple awards writing your game, it's not gonna change the fact that this story is crap, and it's only made worse by the lack of enjoyable gameplay. (And that twist ending... With that scene alone you just made a majority of the CoD: Ghosts campaign null and void and are already sequel baiting for CoD: Ghosts 2)Multiplayer, on the other hand, is the same as ever, if not a little worse. If you like IW CoD multiplayer before, you'll probably like it now. If you liked Black Ops 2 (I admit, I feel it's on par with CoD4), then you will be disappointed. Most of the new good features that Treyarch implimented into BO2 are nowhere to be seen. I think the only feature that survived was a strange version of the loadout points, except now they determine the amount of perks. There's a few new gamemodes that I find interesting and such. I don't know how many of them are original ideas and how many of them have been done before, but new gamemodes are always fun. But with the game as is, it's the same old CoD on the same old downward slope as the series has been on since MW2 (or what I think at least)... And where's theater mode!?The only gamemodes left to talk about are Squad mode and Extinction mode. To be honest I hadn't tried Squad mode, but I probably won't either, due to lack of overall interest in the game already. I tried Extinction mode, and to be honest, it's not that bad. As horde modes go, I liked it and it is on par with Treyarchs Zombie mode. However, it's nothing game changing. It doesn't help the game in any way really. I think the only reason they did it is because Treyarchs Zombie mode was popular and Activision just wanted to milk some more money out of another horde mode. Extinction isn't bad, but it doesn't save the game either.On top of all of these things, the PC port just seems dreadful. Plenty of FPS drops all around, and I've heard that the PC version might be locked at a low framerate. I haven't even really checked for my max FPS, but I've heard others have had a problem like this before. Also, this might be a problem on my end, but I can't seem to get the game to run on my native resolution (1920x1080), which does bug me a lot. It often opens in a borderless window instead of the fullscreen I wanted. IW, do you just hate PC gamers?Now I'm almost always on the line that graphics don't make a good game, but I think it needs to be mentioned: for a ""Next Gen CoD"" the graphics are far from impressive. It still looks pretty much the same as MW2 or MW3. If this is what it's like to step into the next gen of CoD, then please count me out.Overall, both this game and this port are terrible. The single player is forgettable, the multiplayer is less impressive and the extra modes are not a selling point. I think I used about 50-60€ on this game when I bought it and I feel that this is the worst thing I have spent it on this year. Just do yourself a favour and don't buy this game. Or if you really feel the need to buy this game, if you absolutely positively have to get this game, then I suppose you could buy it on a console. But honestly, I still wouldn't recommend this game. It's bad."

76561198007354760,Not Recommended,209160,7790565,"Posted: 27 November, 2013",all,Griffin,"Call of Duty Ghosts comes out as the weakest installment to the series.  If you were hoping to get a new Call of Duty drug fix for the year, Call of Duty Ghosts isn't gonna do it for you.  On max settings there are some spots here and there where you will see some beautiful hi res textures. Unfortunately, that's only on some cases.  Most of the times this ""next-gen"" game pulls out muddy textures lathered in feces throwing it at your face like it's all that.  In the campaign, the levels play out as highly choreographed cutscenes of some of the most common hollywood action movie cutscenes.  They can be really cool at times, but have no lasting power and end way too fast (really short levels).  The campaign for any experienced fps player will take less than 6 hours to beat, considering that some time is placed on setting up the game first.  You'll forget about the campaign the moment you beat it, because it took so little time with uninspired levels.By now this game is notorious for being a poorly implemented console port thrown together by a small team of rotting zombie brains.  Some people simply can't start the game; most have constant stuttering issues.  Those with SLI/Crossfire have graphical distortion, flickering, and major stuttering, which also occurs for single graphics card users.  Random fps drops occur for many people.  The game also has a memory leak where if it doesn't load in another level after a certain amount of time, it'll crash.  Of course that is after a very long time (several hours) before it decides to go hay-wire.  Character models have puddy ugly faces and an ominous glow around them for some nonapparent reason. A developer choice to make it easier to spot players?Everyone on the forums seems to have the mindset that the game doesn't run as well as it should, being a call of duty game.  People with monster rigs of a Titan or even SLI Titans get stuttering and random fps drops too.  Graphical anomoles are present in many places in the campaign, especially the jungle escape level with the river and water causing a massive blue glow pixallation all over the screen making it hard to see anything.  After a certain amount of time playing in the campaign (again a couple of hours), the game will fail to load textures causing everything to be black with grey flickering geometry.  It's like the characters are in the dark.  It takes a restart of the game to fix it, implying that the game isn't utilizing resources correctly.Multiplayer is severely underpopulated making it hard to get a game of for instance search and destroy/rescue.  That makes it uneasy on the mind on how long this game may last on pc.  Some modes such as Capture the Flag failed to make an appearance this time around for no apparent reason at all.  Field of View is locked at 60-65 just like MW3 and there is no official word on if it'll change or if using the FoV unlocker is allowed.  Frames per Second is locked at 91 fps again with no word on whether IW/Activision will change it or allow for the FPS unlocker.  If you have a fancy 120hz or 144hz monitor, there's little use for it in this game.  Nearly every gun in the game takes 3 bullets to kill someone giving no differences between one gun to another causing the guns to have little ""personality"" to them.  They don't really stick out to me.  Couple the fact that it only takes about 3 bullets to kill and the massive lag that everyone experiences, you most often die instantly upon seeing another player, because that player saw you a second or two ago and already shot and killed you before the game even shows it to you.  The lag is preposterous happening in all games to varying  degrees of extreme to minor and unfortunately mostly moderate to extreme.  Multiplayer literally has no anticheat program in it.  The only thing that can barely be considered an anticheat is the submit a player as cheating button, which is like Treyarch's player submission except your submission goes into a pile of crap to be burned as there seems to be no one at the other end that cares to review them.  There is no VAC protection, because of IW/Activision's choice to turn the game into 64bit.exe.  VAC works only with 32bit.  So, there is essentially no anti-cheat.  Cheaters publically mock players over their defenselessness doing whatever they please.  Cheaters are in every other lobby and sometimes in groups or clans together.  Literal actual cheaters using blatant wallhacks and super aimbots among several other cheats like lobby manipulation, not just a suspicion of a good player in-game.  All the ""next-gen"" Dx11 features seem to be poorly implemented and combined with the transition to turning the game into 64bit is probably a lot of the reason for all the performance problems of the game.  Also, the game required at least 6 gigs of RAM despite really only using around 2 gigs and used to lock people from launching the game that had <6gigs of RAM.  The game requires over 40 gigs of HD space despite having such little content and many bland textures making you wonder why the hell the game requires so much damn space, like giving a basket ball stadium to a damn mouse.The gun sounds are thankfully nice and powerful sounding.  The multiplayer maps however are very boring.  They're too large for a small 6 vs 6 game causing a lot of just wandering around with your♥♥♥♥♥♥in your hand before you stumble upon another player wandering around with their♥♥♥♥♥♥in their hand.  IW/Activision also didn't take into account that they should've added a lot more stuff into the very large maps causing a lot of the maps to have large barren areas of nothing.  leading players to constantly follow the edges of the map.  The ""destructable"" environment is really not destructible with only a few or single pre-defined set piece(s) being allowed to fall down in a pre-defined animated way the same way each and every single time.  There are no dedicated servers, which IW/Activision lied so damn hard about.  So, every match you join is a peer to peer match with a person from Uganda.  The game doesn't match players closely together.  So, you're always matched with someone half way around the world.  Considering that there are so few players in this CoD on PC, it's no surprise.  So, super lag for everyone!  Patches role out like snails and for most do nothing, for some do very little improvements, and others actually makes it worse.This game was a disappointment, and the only fun I have now is from playing squads with bots as multiplayer is infested with horrendous lag and cheaters.  I recommend those who haven't bought the game to save their money for Treyarch's rendition of Call of Duty as they place some effort into catering to PC players.Almost forgot, my hardware:i7 3770k oc 4.2ghzGTX 680 FTW 4GB1866Mhz 8GB RAM144Hz Monitor"

The singleplayer is OK, and extintion is quite fun. However the multiplayer was a real let-down. For me, Ghosts multiplayer keeps crashing and during the middle of games, i loose the connection to the host (it isn't my connection, its the game servers). It also lacks in features that games like Black Ops 2 and other Call of Duty games strived. For example, they made quickscoping much harder in ghosts, by removing crosshairs and extending ADS time. Also, as it is designed for a console, it restricts the ability to play in 1080p, and restricts your FOV to 65. IW also restrict the ability to view your ping during a game, and the create-a-class system is terrible. They also made shotguns so OP, more so than Black Ops 2. The squads and safeguard mode in multiplayer is fun thought, and I enjoyed singleplayer. I would recommend buying Battlefield 4 instead, as I have played both games, as in comparison, Battlefield 4 is a much better game, with much higher quality graphics and features."

It feels like you are playing Hardcore mode all the time and for some reason, the dogs in MP take more hits than people. Either the guns are overpowered or you dont not get enough health. Campers are a HUGE problem in this game. The new silde thing in this game is pretty cool though. Also, I have heard there are a lot of hackers and I have run into about 3 since ive been playing. Moving on to creating a class: It's annoying. You have to hog ""squad points"" and it gets boring sometimes. Lastly, still waiting for dedicated servers and hopefully rentable, dedicated servers.SP- There still is a little lag here, but I really enjoyed the story. Really keeps you on the edge and makes you want to keep playing.Bottom line: This game is not bad, but it is far from the best.

That being said, I just can't. The singleplayer campaign is mediocre. There's no emotional buildup, but the game asks you to feel badly when bad things happen to your 'family' and your AI-controlled dog. The plot makes some sense, but it's not coherent - the singleplayer feels like a series of setpieces strung together with an afterthought of a story. At this point I can hear the clamor of fans claiming that ""No one plays CoD for the singleplayer!"" but even the most hard core of fans will see that the campaign was phoned in. As for the multiplayer, it's not bad. I've played a fair amount of it on PC and PS3, and it's enjoyable. That being said, it's not as fun as Black Ops 2's multiplayer (or MW3's, my current favorite) and the maps are ok but nothing to write home about.Technically speaking, the game (before the patches started!) ran great on my computer, except for the graphics settings. With everything maxed out, the game looked terrible! I had to set certain settings on 'High' and others on 'Extra,' otherwise the game looked like I was running it in 'Extra Extra Extra Low and Pixelated' graphics quality. After the patches, the game crashes every few minutes for me. The screen locks up and the game won't quit, even by forcing an end to the process tree. I have to manually restart my computer.Is this game worth the investment? To me, no. It's not bad, but it's not great, and the technical issues have bothered me so much that I've uninstalled it from my library for good. If Steam offered refunds, this would be the first game in line for one, right ahead of Duke Nukem Forever."

Okay, let's start with everything positive I can say about Ghosts:+The Campaign has a somewhat interesting story behind it (kinda)+Well designed missions+Rorke is an entertaining villanNegatives:-Non-memorable characters-Logan has no voice actor-poor optimization-M-27 Thermal-long loading times-low multiplayer populationIt'l be easier just to explain the rest.yes, the campaign is alright, but the characters just aren't as good or memorable as others like Captain Price, Soap Mactavish, or Alex Mason. The fact that your character Logan is silent, it hurts the aspect character than it does to help itExtinction is kinda fun I guess, but due to multiplayer being practically dead, it's hardly fun at all. But hey I guess that's why this game is called 'Ghosts', because this game is dead and it's not worth the DLC at all; do not buy it.For some reason when you zoom in with a sniper rifle, the entire game lags, this is in both campaign and multiplayer. I haave checked the system requirements... My PC meets all the criteria. It makes me not want to use a sniper at all, which is too bad because I love snipers.The multiplayer maps are ginormous, the largest I've seen in any Call of Duty ever. Running into an enemy is uncommon on theses maps, and since the only game mode that's still barely populated is Team Deathmatch, the most players you can find in a game is 12.I can tell you right now that Call of Duty: Ghosts is not worth $60. Not $50, not $40, not $30. I do not recommend this game in general, but if you do want to buy it, only get it when it's on sale. I repeat, do not pay full price for Call of Duty: Ghosts, you will hate yourself if you do.I rate Call of Duty: Ghosts with a 4/10Thank you for reading my review and I'll see you guys on the next one.Let's form up! ~Stealth 1548"

Upon buying Ghosts, I felt like a complete idiot for purchasing such a terrible game that was very unoptimized.Gameplay+Campaign: 6/10The Gameplay of this game is obviously the same as all the other titles aside from the fact that we get sliding, new arm motiong, hurtling, etc. The Gameplay is nothing ""game-changing"" and the Campaign is fairly decent.  It sets you off in a near-future, crippled America and you *SURPRISE, SURPRISE* are a part of the military.  You go to ridiculous ends to stop one man who practically has South America by the balls (Also reminescent of Black Ops 2). Campaign is nothing memorable and you play as a mute. You never talk the whole game EVER...Graphics: 1/10The reason I give this an incredibly low score is due to the fact that even the most power hungry, beastly PCs, cannot run this game better than Battlefield 4.  The game looks the same as MW3 but this game is horribly optimized to the point where I cannot run this game adeptly on my gaming rig...

No matter how much someone wishes to defend this point, the guns have the same characteristics and even share the same stats as previous guns. The servers are laggy, only 3,000 people online, and stuttering due to poor optimization.Overall: 3/10You already know the result, same game every year, so why do we buy it?!

Multiplayer also had me hooked, and even with some niggling complaints from some of the previous games (such as quickscoping), they were still enjoyable and soaked up untold hours of my life.After the launch of MW3, Infinity Ward’s Creative Strategist resigned, the following year Ghosts emerged.Like a lot of other people, I was also led into a false sense of security and invested good money on this game. Only to find out that it would not even be worth the money at a quarter of the price. And instead of fixing al of the bugs, unbalanced multiplayer, ridiculous perks and booting hackers, they would much rather release $130 worth of DLC (to date).The only positive thing that I can say about this game is that Alt+F4 still works.….. No more COD games for me, I’m now put off the franchise."

Decided to play the campaign after a while. It's probably about even with B4 for story so not really worth the play through. Extinction is alright but I really don't even like it as much as zombies or IWs other game (seriously can't remember the name at all). Honestly if you get a next gen console maybe buy this, if you like COD that is, but on PC, avoid it... at all costs... even on Steam sales for that matter.(update:) Worst thing of all the see through walls perks and killstreaks make this game absolutely terrible.

The good: Speaking of multi-player, I do like the new maps, although some are large for the amount of players (6v6 in regular TDM) in the game.  The customizations on your load-outs are decent, not as diverse as Black Ops 2, but I thought that game went overboard with equip set-ups.  It also offers a variety of game modes for different tastes.Now for the bad: The game is almost a month old, and after two patches, the game is still somewhat broken.  My multi-player locks up frequently and I haven't tried to play the single-player after the first week and a half due to it crashing.  On-screen artifacts, stuttering, and possible lag have plagued my GTX 670s in SLI, so I disabled one of the cards to play the game more fluidly.  I think AMD crossfire users have had similar problems.  At this time, there are no dedicated servers and we are playing P2P.  There will likely never be rentable servers for this mess.  In prior COD titles, MW2 and MW3, you at least had the bar displays to tell you what type of connection you had with the host.  In Ghosts, there is nothing to indicate what type of connection you or others have.  FPS are currently capped at around 90 FPS.  FOV is locked at a nauseating and headache inducing level of 65, but at least there are third-party programs available to help in this area.  Some of the game modes are virtually empty and the game is not even a month old.  I think the total players fell to between 2000-3000 people this evening.  Check for yourself how the community is supporting this game athttp://steamgraph.net/.In summary, I think Activision and Infinity Ward have abandoned PC gamers where COD is concerned.  This game was originally touted as next-gen, but in my opinion, they have actually gone backwards.  If this is next-gen, then we are in serious trouble.  COD: Black Ops is a helluva lot better than this steaming pile and that game is now three years old, plus it had dedis.  I doubt I am alone in thinking that we paid full price to be beta-testers.  They should have paid us to play this jewel."

The multiplayer is dead on PC and for a good reason so if you're dying to play this online you're way better off playing this on consoles just becuase you can actually play any game mode without having to worry about the lobby being an empty.

Buying the game on PC near release I was dissapointed to find I had trouble enjoying every aspect of the game without having my own friends to play the game with me. I believe CoD is a Unique franchise that more PC gamers would enjoy if it lost some of its publishing steampower (for starters maybe not have a CoD released before EVERY holiday season making a community nearly impossible to develop.) i know this is an extremely powerful marketing stratedgy that excels on console game sales but i also know there are many heavy PC gamers that purposely wait for good games they want to come down in price before they buy simply because of the economic situation that hovers over the video game industry and every person involved in it. More people would give the franchise a chance, if it were able to come down in retail price after a year of its release date when sales have plateued and enable retailers to put the game on promotional sales which would in turn sell more copies enabling much larger communities to arouse on PC"

This game has serious performance issues.  A game like this should be running at 60fps with max settings easily.  But instead, it's performance is so completely bonkers that you are forced to dial down the graphical settings in order to get a steady framerate.  Oh, and if you have an SLI or CFX rig, then you'll need to disable one of your GPUs in order for this game to run.  There's also no FOV setting in order to alleviate the default tunnel vision, and the mouse acceleration is so bad that you WILL miss your shots by overreaching the mouse cursor.It's sad, too, because this could have been one of the better entries to this franchise.  The new maps are large, and with more vertical design.  Long sightlines and less cramped corridors.  The class system is very flexible in creating your own unique soldier.  Extinction Mode is better than Zombies, in my opinion, because you have an actual endgame to work towards.  Unlike in Zombies, where even the best laid plans are eventually fruitless to the invincible hordes of the undead that keep coming round after round.But none of these things can be enjoyed to their full extent with a game that performs this poorly.  Infinity Ward needs to address these issues with a serious update.  Everyday I see less and less players in every game mode at every time of the day and night.  Players are migrating away from this game, and it's understandable why.Not recommended as a purchase until these problems are fixed.

,Not Recommended,209160,8324826,"Posted: 26 December, 2013",all,Couch Ornament,"What a dismal excuse for a game. The engine is so unoptimised that it runs poorly on dual 7950s, no FOV adjustments so it looks horrible on multi monitor. Further the game is so bloated, needing almost 40GB for a game with such bland textures and crappy AI is a joke, further, the 6GB RAM requirement is insane for this game (though I have 16GB) This is the same engine it was 5 years ago, with a few tweaks, there is no reason for it to be so unoptimised. The jittery framerates, and poor FOV has made it hard for me to play much of it, but what I have played is so bland and basic that I really am not interested in playing more. COD had its time in the sun... 7 years ago, now it is just rehashed garbage that seems to be declining in quality with every release. Will never purchase again. Hell I should have been smart and got a ""trial"" of this first before spending my hard earned money on it. STAY AWAY FROM THIS JOKE OF A GAME!!!Now that I have finished the game. I stand by my original opinion. The single player feels like it was stiched together from cutting room floor cast offs from previous titles and glued together with a weak story. By this I mean, you are supposed to be playing as a Ghost, a stealthy, covert, deadly force, for 3/4 of the game you aren't even a Ghost, nothing is stealthy nor are you a force to be reckoned with. After you do become a Ghost you are slapped around like a little ♥♥♥♥♥, the missions are all about running and hiding and don't fit with the Ghost story told at the beginning. Further there is far too many resources squandered on the dog, Riley, whom you can control through a computer system (but only when scripted) somehow this huge German Shephard is so stealthy he can crawl right past enemies unseen, he is taken from you on the beach mission and then randomly reappears near the end of the game *spoilers* when you have to carry the poor pup to safety. This part feels like it was tacked on when they realised the game was far too short. (As it was, on hard I finished in 7 hours, this is with all the dying I was doing due to the sudden and random frame drops, had I not had to redo so many sections I am confident I could have finished in under 6 hours) Even without Riley on screen if you've turned the dog effects up, you will have random and sudden framedrops. While playing you are so forced where to go, the game may as well have been on rails. You cannot even choose a path through a fountain, you have to go around it, funnelled down a road where the crappy enemy AI can shoot you. They do not aim, the bullets just magically find you if you are to the remotely in front of the enemy. I had one facing almost totally away from me, only to have him suddenly facing me as I crept closer, I am not saying he turned, or moved to be facing me... he was just suddenly facing me gun up and firing as if he had been the whole time. Rarely do you actually get to make a choice or go off on your own and when you do it is all too brief. Your teammates take priority forcing you out of the way through doors, or pushing you out of cover if they are scripted to be there. But all for not as they couldn't hit the broadside of a barn. Back to the performance issues from my original post, with third party hacks and some doctoring of the game I was able to get a playable (solid) framerate, decent FOV and proper multi monitor support, however I CANNOT use this in multiplayer, so the game is still broken. PC Gamer reports having it run great (100fps) on dual TITANS (single monitor), however, this is stupid for this engine, dual 650's or dual 6850's should run this engine that fast. Dual Titans, 780ti, 290X's etc should run this game well over 100fps solid on nVidia Surround or AMD Eyefinity, dual 7950 should be able to get a solid 60fps. As I said in my original post, this game bites... CoD is all but dead and hopefully it finds its way to the grave soon. I will no longer be purchasing any CoD title (on PC or Consoles) even if this was in the bargin bin I would tell you to steer clear."

This game was released long ago and Infinity Ward has ignored the PC gaming community completely due to lack of patches and fixes for their broken release. The game is a waste of internet download time, since the game is around 40 GB, but the game itself doesn't look any more grahpically intensive. The FOV is locked at a nauseous 65, though the gaming community has unofficial FOV changers.In Ghosts Multiplayer, IW tried to copy Black Ops 2 style of weapon loadouts and class editing, but instead made a huge mess with too many split up perks and guns with forced attachments (like a silencer). Customization was thought to be increased with the new player editor, but this game has far less customization than before. Each Soldier can only carry six different loadouts and you can't customize them much more than their skin color until you play Multiplayer and complete certain objectives to gain clothing. You are only able to change the soldier's outfit as a whole, except for the headpiece. There are no more custom emblem editors in the game, you now have to use premade patches created by IW.Multiplayer itself could have been a fun experience, but I wouldn't be able to tell you since the game is broken and not playable for me. Multiplayer is locked at 91 FPS while I have a 144hz screen and a more than capable GPU of running this game. As of 12/21/2013 I have only put around 30 hours into this game and have uninstalled it due to it wasting space on my hard drive.Avoid this game."

The multiplayer is subpar, at best.  Hacks present themselves every couple of weeks, though they are quickly remedied.  The real issue, I have found, is the random crashes.I am playing CoD: Ghosts running 3.4gig 8core ,4gig ATI card, 24gig RAM.  The game crashes, consistantly.  I'm not the only one having these problems.  Anyone who runs significantly over the minimum will find that their multiplayer game will be cut short, with frequency.

Yes, you her me, a Thousand player playing the whole game, several game modes are ghost town with 0 to 5 players in the whole world, the only game mode you may find people is Team Deathmatch, and not much, maybe 500 people and if you leave one server that's waiting for more people to search for another server, well you'll end up in the same one.This game is a huge step back from CoD Franchise, which already had bad reputation among hardcores, but now more than ever this game has went downhill."

Sadly after CoD4 it seems that this franchise has started to die off, but I don't mean that their games don't sell - They do.What I mean is that from a gamers perspective, each game seems to be getting worse as they get pushed out. This is the first CoD title I have bought on my PC as I originally played on Xbox. I feel that, most developers these days seem to be under the impression we want a high tech. loadout system. I'm not saying that the loadouts are a bad idea, however, what happened to the sdays when everyone spawned with the same weapon and it became more about controlling key areas and weapon respawn points than someone being rank 60 with every perk/attachment on their gun going up against someone significantly lower? This is the case for most games these days, as every FPS uses this system now.In regards to this game specifically, it will be the last CoD title I buy at this point. The campaign has it's merits, though copied cutscenes from previous games probably aren't the best idea, but I managed to complete it on VETERAN in a matter of 5.6 hours. CoD 2 I may have finished on Veteran in 5.6 days... It wasn't a challenge at all - simplified for the kids, made easier, is this what games have become?Multiplayer - On Steam, launch day had 24k players online... Peak now is 10k (and these figures aren't exactly amazing), off peak you're looking at roughly 3k-5k. I noticed some of the cut corners in certain maps, square wheels for example. It hasn't been polished at all. Maybe the Xbox version is different in some respects, but from a PC POV it's not great.Ultimately my Not Recommended comes from the rinse and repeat effect most AAA titles have these days, gaming is just not what it used to be - Maybe I'm just getting old :3"

The controls are sluggish and it feels like you are moving through molasses. Sounds are terrible.

The campaign was okay, but nothing compared to Black Ops 2's story where they actually tried new things. The main issue is the multiplayer. The key selling factor of the game (I barely know anyone who plays CoD for the story). The singleplayer and Extinction mode's work fine, until you play the multiplayer aspect of the game. You'll be getting constant FPS drops and will run into hackers A LOT (granted the FPS drops will vary but majority of players are still having these issues including me w/ my AMD FX-8120 and GTX 760) I usually have to play on everything low at 720p to get a steady framerate, but some maps STILL cause you to drop frames constantly. Not only that, but they promised dedicated servers but I keep getting P2P connections. I'd say pick up Black Ops 2 if you want a good experience on PC, I sadly don't own it on PC (I have it on PS3) but that games WAY better than Ghosts. Avoid this title unless you're REALLY wanting this game. It had potential to be a different CoD experience, and it failed on every level."

Probably the best part of the game. Previous Call of Duty games have not impressed me the way Ghosts did. New storyline, new characters, new feel. When it comes down to the effort the developers put into the single player campaign, they blew the roof off. And might I say, the ending was impressive, leaving behind a hint of a sequel.Multiplayer, on the other hand, does feel a little bit repetitive compared to Infinity Ward's previous installments in the CoD franchise such as Modern Warfare 2 or Modern Warfare 3. I have been a fan of Infinity Ward's development of multiplayer since MW2, so I don't expect Ghosts multiplayer to disappoint me as time goes on. The upcoming map packs do seem promising as well.I haven't spent too much time in Squads, so I can't really give a fully constructed review on it, but the one or two games that I did play were - let's say - interesting.And as for Extinction, I have not played any of it at all yet. But based on reviews I've read about it, I would safely assume that it's different from Treyarch's Zombies, but familiar. Like Apple's iOS 7.In short, Infinity Ward has not disappointed me yet, even in past Call of Duty games. I don't expect them to let me down any time soon. I recommend this for those who have a powerful computer. If you don't have a reliablly powerful computer, invest your money elsewhere.EDIT 22 September 2015: Yeah... this is a sh*tty game. In fact, calling it a piece of sh*t would be a compliment. Save yourself from heartache and wallet-ache and don't buy this abomination of a digital pile of sh*t."

This game was not yet fit for the PC form factor and alas, after 60+ hours spread over several years, waiting . . . . hoping, that the next time I drop into the game there will be some kind of optimisation for modern hardware, some kind of SSAO that worked or for that matter any aspect of this games visuals.Without going into too much detail, using either one graphics card or two, performance is still bad. Using six - eight core cpu's intel or amd  . . . poor performance and utilisation, game data files loaded on ssd's in raid 0 almost 1gb/s read write?You guessed it, poor performance.Now the Call Of Duty series was always drama done badly, this was it's charm, how absurd and unrealisitc it was and how you could call in a tactical nuke after your kill streak, shooting someone with an rpg after spinning aroung in the air like a tweaking meth addict at a disco and scoring a headshot with a ballistic knife afterwards at range.There were some fun times, but that was when I was at the age of 17 - 18. I am 25 now and nothing has changed in those years, nothing has improved, sales of this game are obviously dropping to better more refined titles,Put simply IW. After MW2 you should have stopped and let it die.Stop reanimating this corpse, let it rest. Come up with some new ideas?  I Mean it's not like you don't have the financial power to do so. reinvent something different or perhaps go back to your roots, when you made games WORTH buying.Games that people used to sit up all night playing and turn up late for work or school.Honestly I can never see this happening and if there is one thing that anyone takes from this.Look at indie sales of classic genre games, look at terreria, look at the roguelikes, consider those classic shooters like Killing Floor2 starting out as a mod and making it to early access, being barely half finished and playing 100x better than this drivel you persist on regurgitating, year on year on our gaming networks, You are no better than apple.The company as a whole has become a laughing stock among the gaming community and shall remain that way as long as you continue to churn out this 'standard' of game and until that changes this will only continue to decline for IW and TA.Ask yourself why these indie titles are doing so well, and why re releases of classic are destroying AAA's right now.Figure that one simple question out . . . and you've got yourself a game."

First of, i really don´t enjoy palying shooter games on Consoles, because i don´t like the handling and aiming, and if you feel the same way, don´t buy this game.As the most other CoD Games, this Game is very Console orientated (Field of View locked on 65, normal PC-shooters should at least support 90; max fps Cap of 90fps; only a Volume-Changer in the Audio Menu, so there is no adjust for your Gear (5.1, Stereo, Headphones); and the list goes on, but you can read about this on the internet as well).The second big flaw in this game are the maps. They are way to big for 12 Players (which is the most common in the CoD: Ghosts Playlists). I mean on the most Maps you can run 3 miuntes staright and if you are lucky/unlucky you don´t see one enemy during this time.But the worst thing, in my opinion, is the Promised ""Next Gen"" Graphic.Compared to MW 3 it just looks the same, until you go to your settings and set Textures, etc.. to Extra, and even if you do so, the game looks like MW 3 with a little bit a Graphic update.So if you are a hardcore fan, you mostlikely bought the game already, but if you are a Casualplayer looking for a good Shooter, then wait until ""Titanfall"" is released, because in my opinion, and a few others, this is going to be far better then Ghosts.All in all, this game can be fun at stages, but compared to MW 2 it is a big step back (not the graphics, but the gameplay and some other game aspects).Overall it´s still in my top 10 CoD Games :)Hope i could help with this review.Best regardesACE"

I was like, ""Damn, a Call of Duty game is actually 50% off? You don't see that every day.""I heard a LOT of bad things about this game, but people can be heavily opinionated against Call of Duty for its lackluster multiplayer, its way-too-over-the-top campaign and its pathetic rehash of the same♥♥♥♥♥♥over and over again. But, after what seemed to be a revitalization of the series (Black Ops II), I thought, ""Well, Infinity Ward is doing something different, and they made COD4, so this game has to be at least decent, right?""I was wrong. And I regret everything I've ever done.This game is not onlyWORSEthan Modern Warfare 3 (and I say thatverypainfully, because I thought that would be theworstCall of Duty game), but it actually astounds me on how not only it's a bad game, but it's also aterrible ♥♥♥♥ing PC port.Let's start off with the campaign, which is...lackluster, to say the least, in a lot of departments. So, we start off our ""campaign"" with backstory (usual for any game). And this is when my problems with this game begin. If you turn on captions in the game, not only are they not Modern Warfare-styled in the PC version while they are on consoles (I would be fine with this if theydidn'tchoose text that's worse than Comic Sans), but the size of it is so damn big that it takes up nearly a fourth of the screen. I didn't think much of it, so I just moved along, because captions are something that's not really important to make a good game (TF2 doesn't have (working) captions, and it's amazing). Immediately when the campaign was interactive, the game took ahugeframe drop for no reason. Granted, I was recording with FRAPS, and when I paused the recording, the game ran perfectly fine. But what bothered me was thatI was getting 30 frames per second onnormalsettings on this game. I run Battlefield 4 perfectly fine, 60 FPS, high settings, no frame drops or crashes. Why the ♥♥♥♥ is this game lagging for me onnormalsettings?Anyway, I progressed on with the game, and by the time I got to the point where♥♥♥♥♥♥was exploding and we had to push open a door (which you literally press a button and win the fight, apparently), a white light appeared and...The game crashed.I'm not ♥♥♥♥ing kidding, the game crashed on a scripted sequence. And it never does that on console. Why the ♥♥♥♥ does it do it here.I rebooted the game, and (thankfully) my progress was where it was at last time. So, now I find myself at a space station. I explore for a bit, and then some bad guys show up, and I shoot them, and I realize they aren't Russians. Okay, cool, something new for once (even though Battlefield 4 kind of did that with the Chinese and♥♥♥♥♥♥ but Russia was still there, so whatever). You go to blow up this intergalactic space station sort of thing and then you die. No, seriously, you die within, like, 10 minutes of taking control of the character, and that's if you go really,reallyslow. Good job, game, I certainly feel the emotion of dying.BECAUSE THAT EXISTS.So, more backstory, apparently the bad guys were a troupe called the ""Federation"", which consisted of all South American countries. There's no reason as to why they banded together, they just did. Okay, so this is like, what, did someone just invade all the South American countries and the leaders were like, ""♥♥♥♥, you got me red-handed, take over my country""? Are you ♥♥♥♥ing kidding me? Explain this♥♥♥♥♥♥ god dammit, it's driving me nuts finding a plot hole within thefirst thirty minutes of the game.Back to controlling some guy named Logan on the ground (oh yeah, his name is Logan Walker). More explosions, Michael Bay apparently directed this game or some♥♥♥♥♥♥ you jump onto a house that nearly collapses on you, and you nearly die, but then your father comes and picks you up in his truck while ♥♥♥♥ing explosions and fire iseverywhere around him. Realism, ladies and gentlemen. It's just amazingly stellar in a game that prides itself on its realism. /sarcasmSome more♥♥♥♥♥♥happens, you take control of a dog--oh yeah, I completely forgot about the dog!So, yeah, apparently, when this game was still in development, Infinity Ward and Activision were making a big deal out of two things in particular: realistic dogs andfish AI. I wish I was joking, but I'm not, they ♥♥♥♥ing made a big deal out of something that wasIN VIDEO GAMES SINCE SUPER MARIO 64, and acting like it was new. And I'm gonna be honest, I never ♥♥♥♥ing saw the fish AI in this game. At all. There's no sequence where you get to see it, to show you ""Hey, look what we did"", they just added it in there for people looking for easter eggs or some♥♥♥♥♥♥ Also, the dogs aren't realistic. They ♥♥♥♥ing move like a walrus and their fur is textured so badly that I'm pretty sure I can actually see some white, untextured spots on their fur. Good job, Infinity Ward, you made two broken features that you praised so immensely. You should feel proud.Anyway,♥♥♥♥♥♥happens, and you apparently become a part of this squad called Ghosts that your dad was secretly a part of this entire time (wow, thanks for telling me, Dad) and then you gotta do some missions for them. At this point, I kind of just zoned out throughout the entire campaign because I already knew how this campaign was going to be within the first thirty minutes. ""It's just going to be nonsensical shooting at bad guys, more explosions and stupid scripted sequences that make you want to facepalm because the actions of the characters are so dumb in them"", I thought to myself. And sadly, I was right. And not only was I right on that, but I was also right on another thing.This game crashes.A LOT. I experienced at the veryleast, 10 crashes. There were no error messages prior to those crashes. And I'd also like to point out that when the game crashed,my graphics driver crashed with it. A game playing on normal settings crashes for no reason, and crashes my graphics driver, when Battlefield 4 does literally none of that on high settings.♥♥♥♥ing. Amazing. Optimization.I (somehow) managed to finish the game in under 7 hours, and I slowly put my hand over my face, and quietly said to myself, ""I just wasted 30 dollars"". Because that's all this game is. Quite honestly, I wasluckyto get this game for 30 dollars. I actually feel bad for the people that spent 60 dollars on this game, because, the sad fact is, Big Rigs: Over the Road Racing, Superman 64 and♥♥♥♥ing SONIC THE HEDGEHOG (2006)areallbetter than this game. And unlike those games,this game had two years to be good and had a multi-million dollar budget. There's literally no excuse to making a game like this with all those resources.They couldn't even be bothered to make proper credit music. They stole off of Eminem for their credit music. After a dramatic ending, they stole off a♥♥♥♥ing RAP SONG.. Good job, Infinity Ward.This game is♥♥♥♥♥♥ It's that simple. I wasted 14 hours of my life for nothing. I didn't play Extinction mode because, despite the praise of being the only good aspect of this game, I just didn't want to play this game anymore. I didn't even get to level 20 in Ghosts because I just gave up trying with this game. It's a complete and utter mess, and this something I don't expect from an AAA-title made by a corporation that makes good games every now and then, and developed by a company thatmade two ♥♥♥♥ing good games in the first place.Infinity Ward, you're ♥♥♥♥ing stupid.

They seem to be either hit or miss with most people though. Anyway... I've had the game for a while now and have a couple things to note.1- The campaign is extremely short. If you're buying this for the single player, don't waste your money. Less than 8 hours to get through it start to finish and none of the levels really have any replay value.2- When I first got it I had a ton of problems with it running smoothly. I don't have the best gaming rig out there but it's no store bought piece either. i5 with 16gb memory and a gtx760. Nothing fancy but should definitely be able to run without any issues and yet it was almost unplayable at first. Not as big of an issue now after updates and all but still.3- My final and biggest complaint. I got perminently banned from the multiplayer. why? no idea. I was playing a squads game and all the sudden a message came up saying that I was banned for violating some policy. After looking up the policy I see that it's all about cheating or hacking or modding or stealing the game... None of which I did or would even know how to if I wanted to. Then when I get ahols of them to see what going on they pretty much tell me that the ban is final and aren't going to do anything about it. So now i'm out the $120 I spent for the game with all the DLC. I've never been more dissapointed in a company and they way the handled issues. I'm all for people being perminently banned for anything within that policy. But the fact they won't even tell me how I got banned is completely ridiculous. Its things like this that make me (a long time fan of the game and studio) want to completely stop buying their products, especially if this is how they treat people.PS. from what I can tell, it seems that I'm not the only one who has had this happen to them. a quick look at their forum and it's pretty obvious they have screwed over quite a few people.

I revelled in the graphic delight of the game though, throughout; maybe even more when I played it on VETERAN difficulty!I understand Rorke, wasn't ""eliminated"", made me think of his future in upcoming games, even searching wiki's in Advanced Warfare for his name without success! The experience was so intense, at times I felt from my inner-most a deep desire for the possibility of more interaction possibilities (something like wanting a little Watch_dogs here :-), don't you want that sometimes?The story was satisfying with a definite longing for more, but how this Episode of COD, starts & ends it's own story unlike MODERN WARFARE 1,2 & 3 (which are continuations of each other) leaves me with a void! I want more of this!! The idea of a fight that ultimately leads to a stalemate is what the plot here is about! Everytime on edge! There's no ""Soap"" Mctavish, and it's entirely fiction (unlike Black ops). The story was about GOOD soldiers & I wanted them to win in the end-not a draw!

Even with the game on an SSD the missions loaded very slowly. Did the devs use PSD files instead of JPGs?There were glitches that prevented me from completing the mission. Restarting the mission and trying again fixed it. AI would block other AI. There was this glitch that prevented a mission from advancing forward because I had the game installed on an external USB 3 device. This has been the only game I have heard of that required faster the USB 3 speeds to load game files.The story was also not really enjoyable. The space and underwater fighting was cool.

Also I have played 4hrs of singleplayer and 10 hours of Multiplayer.I was excited to finally buy a COD game which I thought would (since it was the latest at the time of writing) be bustling with players and features. All my friends recommended I should buy it, So I did... and I was wrong. After some time with the game, I regret buying it.Single player is great!And if thats what matters to you then this game is a thumbs up! I recommend the singleplayer portion. The story is brilliant and full of amazing locations, the voice acting is terrific and the end left me wanting more. No problems here.Multiplayer is a different story... No matter what time of day I decide to play, I cannot find ANY games on any gamemode except Domination. Yes my NAT is open but the game just doesn't locate a match. I can easily connect to AUS/NZ servers on any other game. And I thought new games were active, I am clearly mistaken. Secondly, after a match is over, instead of returning to lobby, I get a black screen. Minimising the game and Maximising seems to fix this, so i'd say its a nVidia bug that only affects COD:Ghosts.Multiplayer too, refuses to startup in most cases without hanging, I have to force close and relaunch.In conclusion, for a game that is the latest in the franchise, with all the issues of Mulitplayer, which is a key component to the game, I am left regretting my descision to buy, and I see why it's cheaper than the older Black Ops: 2. That is enough to give this review a thumbs down, even if the singleplayer was AMAZING."

Ghosts is a very big game, and will require a very good computer to play. But if you are one of those people you have really bad fps. go to this link and scroll down until it says fps unlocker. Its by infinity ward so no virus. when u open it. make sure u have ghosts open. and it will say. succesfully set fps to 250. Now when u get in a game. you will have 5 seconds of lag. After that.

I didn't even buy Advanced Warfighter and I won't, I won't buy Black Ops 3, I won't buy World At War 2, I won't buy any Call of Duty games to come, I'm done, I like to collect games and to also play them, I like to hav the whole series but I seriously don't think I want to waste my money on this one, PC storage and to spoil my Steam library for any of their games, I don't wanna spoil my gray matter either and If I do buy their games then that's what gonna happen.Call of Duty 1 and 2 are still 21.99 CAD 14 years later.The so called ""DLCs"" and ""expansions"" are way too overpriced, they'll say that It's worth that much but for real, all the DLCs in this game are not even worth 1$ put together.Just face it, making maps aren't hard especially once you have the engine and stuff to make them, making stupid skins isn't hard either, so selling 1 skin for 2$ is pure ******** so is selling a déjà vu expansion pack of 4 maps for 16.99 CAD.It's the same thing every years!Wake up, do not give those clowns your money, they do not deserve it even if you were rich, they don't deserve anything but to fail, everyone that helps them with those ideas should just be fired and work at McDonald's and the rights should go to another developer that knows how to get it done.Look at The Witcher made by CD Projekt, they give us DLCs for free each week (except when there are updates which are real great anyway) and we pay for the expansions but the expansions are true expansions, they stay true to their name because they add stuff, a lot of stuff, so much more playtimeTheir games are great, even better after each one, they don't release a new game each year, we wouldn't need to anyway because there's a lot of replay ability.Let's not forget that they sell their games for 59.99$, of course, 59.99$ is too much for a game but at least, it's good, it's not 110$ and In 3, 4 years It wil be 19.99$.In 6, 8 years It will be 9.99$ and they wouldn't even need to do that, the game is and will still be totally worth it unlike some **** called Call of Duty maded by a bunch of clowns who doesn't knows anything about coding and that do not know how the gaming industry works, they don't care at all about their fans, that's if they do still have some but people are so stupid nowadays so of course they probably do.Seriously, this should be a crime, this developer/publisher should be considered as a crime to all what's good on Earth.Come people, wake up, go buy yourself some food, buy another game on steam and play it or you could even get outside, go to the cinema with your wife/girlfriend if you have one and watch a girly movie with her just for her, It would still be better than playing this **** so called game.As an hardcore gamer, this is just outreagous, even for casual gamers. It just doesn't make sense.There are so many great games on the PC, just look on Steam but please, just do not give them your money, do not pre-purchase their games, do not even buy their games even if 90% (which will never happen, 50% is too much for them, they'll lose money you know, anything but that).What you do with your money is up to you but I'm trying to help you and the gaming industry, save your money, buy great games, support the music you like by buying it, support movies you love, buy weed, give your money to someone who needs it, buy food for the hopeless, do anything you want with it but do not give it to Activison, Treyarch or Infinity Ward.This game and I'm being honest deserves a -5/10, It's really pathetic, good job Activision, good job Infinity Ward and good job Treyarch."

This is major fail. I got 1Gig ATI 5850 and framerate at low settings where textures look like those seen in Might and Magic 3 is like 20 fps.Gameplay....so-so.If you want to enjoy long time spent on a great shoot out game, go for Bad Company 2, now sold for like 5 bucks. You will do much better. If you pick up the Vietnam datadisc and also MoH Tier 1, you spend around 12€ and get 50x longer gameplay and experience.Or buy just anything else.

Ok, I thought, I'll just get more RAM. Ordered 4 more gigs, went to install it and the new RAM sticks (with identical part #'s) blew out three of the four DIMM slots on my mobo. Now what? I paid $60 for the game, another $70 for the new RAM, which I had to RMA with a 15% restocking fee. I still wasn't able to play Ghosts, so: I bought a new PC. Guess what? Ghosts ran the first time without a single hiccup.This configuration runs the game on ultra settings for me at a solid 60 FPS, GPU never goes above 62C at load, CPU has never gone above 42C at load (all air-cooled) :Intel Core i5-4670 Haswell 3.4 GHz 84 Watt CPU BX80646I54670PNY VCGGTX7702XPB GeForce GTX 770 2GB 256-bit GDDR5 PCI Express 3.0 x16 SLI Support Video Card (with triple fan cooling)Team Vulcan 8GB (2 x 4GB) 240-Pin DDR3 SDRAM DDR3 2133 (PC3 17000) Desktop Memory Model TLD38G2133HC11ADC01Thermaltake TR2 TR-500 500W ATX12V v2.3 SLI Ready CrossFire Ready Power SupplyASUS B85-G LGA 1150 Intel B85 HDMI SATA 6Gb/s USB 3.0 Micro ATX Intel Motherboard (Only stereo, will need to add a sound card to get my 5.1 speakers working with it.)**see update belowZALMAN CNPS8000B 92mm FSB (Fluid Shield Bearing) CPU Coolerx5 MASSCOOL FD12025S1L3/4 120mm Case Cooling Fans all aroundThermaltake Commander MS-I Epic Edition Black / Red SECC ATX Mid Tower Computer CaseWindows 8.1 Update 1 64-bitSeagate Barracuda ST500DM002 500GB 7200 RPM 16MB Cache SATA 6.0Gb/s 3.5"" Internal Hard DriveLG Internal Super Multi Drive 24X DVD+R 8X DVD+RW 8X DVD+R DL 24X DVD-R 6X DVD-RW 16X DVD-ROM 48X CD-R 24X CD-RW 48X CD-ROM SATA Model GH24NSB0Seagate Expansion 3TB USB 3.0 3.5"" Desktop External Hard Drive STBV3000100.I got that for around $1200, all because I was out $80 on the game and the restock fee for the RAM.So, no need to break the bank, and CoD Ghosts runs amazingly well and is graphically stunning.

Every game I get into, if I can get into a game, takes a long time to load and is ridiculously unplayable. The PC community months after the game launched has less than a few players evidenced by the ""number of players"" info when perusing the game types, only a few people playing on only a couple of game modes, most game modes have zero (0) players so you cant play them at all, this doesnt change - ever, everytime you look, it's the same story, only the punished few. The PC community is being ignored by Activision. We dont have the simplest of options in the game, there are no separate controls for volume, no options to pick a server with a good ""ping"". We have no dedicated servers (if there were, why does the server freeze then toss you mid-game when a player quits?), we have to join, if we can at all, whatever map / server the system picks for you. There are no options for map type, ping, number of players, etc ...  most of the convenient choices in previous versions of this game are gone. If the system puts you in a map you dont want to play or its so laggy you cant play, you can not get out right away, you have to wait and wait and wait, then when you finally have the chance to go back to the main menu and try a different ""map/server ""  you find yourself waiting in que for the same map you just left, then you have to waste your time trying to get out all over again! This process of trying to find a mediocre at best map to play can waste up to 5 minutes or more of your time. Lately (Feb 2014) even though there seems to be players (1000) in a couple game modes, I can't join at all even though I honestly waited 20-30 minutes, just to see how long it would take. GAMEPLAY (when you are fortunite enough to get into a game) -  When I die the killcam shows something completely different than what I experienced while dying. Its as if the player that killed me and I are a second or two apart in the timing of the game. This is not an isolated event, it happens everytime I play. I hear other players complaining about the same experience, constantly, every game! Players accusing other of cheating when its the game  programmers code that must be allowing this strange behavior, I hear accusations between players constantly. There always seems to be one player without the problem, he's usually top of the leader board. This phenomenom nessesitates the need to play only the servers/games that you dont crash/freeze/lag immediatly until the game picks you as host, then you can improve your K/D ratio, until then you have to get out quick because it's impossible to play. I have read countless reviews, seen countless YouTube videos, and talked with other players who have relentlously reported these problems to Activision. These problems are global and have been proclamed by all who play whether its Xbox, or PC (PC wholly the worst). The support from Activision or Infinity Ward whomever handles problems reported by players, is unresponsive. They already made their money, they're probably laughing all the way to the bank. I have a 75M up/ 35M down fiber connection and an Alienware ""built for speed, I7 6860HQ 3.6Ghz., 8 gig Ram, Nvidea GTX 780, etc... computer. I feel like I am being punished for investing in equipment for gaming. I dont nessesarily want an advantage (of course I do) over others just a fair gaming experience. I die in the game from players that arent on my screen yet, nobody is there, in an empty room, but the killcam showed him shooting me for seconds right in front of me, or I shoot him first, empty my gun into him, before he even sees me, then I die, the killcam shows him shooting me for 2 sec and my back was turned because he was 2 sec ahead in the game and I hadnt turned to shoot him yet, we were not even in the same game. I don't have this problem with other FPS games such as BattleField 4, Titan Fall (new) or Crysis. I also turn all the video options to their lowest settings but it doesnt matter even with a $600 GTX 780 card. I also see cheaters running rampant in way too many games, I finally found out that leaving the game an using ""F1"" to look at ""friends"" allows you to report the person, most people like me, for months, dont know how to report anyone. The cheats know this so they feel free. If you report them either nothing is done or the guy gets his Steam account reset then he goes back into the game and resumes cheating, these guys laugh at Activision and are open about the fact that they cant be stopped. You see people at presique 1 level 30 with a ""custom name"" mopping everyone, obviously a reset player. Over and Over! How much can even a dedicated COD player endure? It's ridiculous. I hear many players talking about leaving COD for good and I am probably going to join them. This is what happens when a Company like Activision allows players to believe they don't care, maybe they became corrupt and greedy and started publishing unfinished games to the public. You cant convince me Activision couldnt fix these problems if they wanted to invest the time, they are capable, the answer must be they just don't care about us! The game is sold, it's over, time to move on and make more money. Don't get me wrong I like money too, Problem is.... I really loved this game! Perfect in fit for the player that wants a challenge. But not anymore! What a waste of a formerly capable game concept."

Simply because the Maps were a Cluster♥♥♥♥, some of them were just to Small and annoying.But i actually loved the Idea the Developers were going for, what you are noticing in this game is that Footsteps, Team Callouts are a big part of this Multiplayer, it was supposed to be a Shooter where you need to pay attention to your Surroundings because each step could be your last one.Character Customization:Ghosts is the first COD that lets you change the appearance of your Soldier/Soldiers, thats right, you can have more then one Character to play and each one Levels Up separately, but why would you want more Characters to LVL Up of you can have a♥♥♥♥♥♥ton of loadouts on only 1 ?For the part i enjoyed the most the : Squad ModeIn this Additional Gamemode you can create a Squad out of all your Soldiers.This allows you to compete against Squads of other Players and earn additional XP Boosts if your squad manages to pull over a fight while you are not even there to help it.I actually like that System, creating your own Characters and play with them on your side on the Battlefield.Extinction :The new ""Zombie Mode"" of COD now features Aliens and it is realy fun to play, thats actually all i can say about it i mean there are different Abilities you can choose from and its actually disapointing that for more Missions you need to buy the DLCs but all around ... the gamemode is fun.The Community: Well its obvious that the COD Community is the worst and in a game that is called ""The worst of the series""it also is obvious that everyone is being a♥♥♥♥♥♥about everything but that is not the Point iam going for.I know that as a Player you want to go for the Stuff that is hard to get and take the best weapon in the game all over again but JESUS CHRIST !The Usual squad you will come across is a Army of Bushes and everyone is using the AK-12 with the same Mods on each of them and its just ... realy annoying that no one wants Variation in their Squad, nope lets give everyone the same Equipment and Perks so they will have no variation, no balancing and so on.It is not like that they are OP it is just annoying to see that in a game with so much Weapons ... everyone is using the same weapon and perks because it is ""The Best"".But all around ... COD Ghosts wasnt that bad of a game ...It is totally not worth its Money and plays like a F2P Shooter but it can be entertaining.It shows what it wanted to be in the first place and it couldnt get out its full Potential but the Singleplayer,and we are talking about COD, the Singleplayer the ""Zombie Mode"" and the new Squadmode were fun to play (Well for me, this is still my opinion)The game had a good amount of potential but well ... this came out.Again:Totally not worth its Money if it would be a 29,99€ Game it would be acceptable.It felt like a new COD like it or not it had aspects that other CODs didnt have.I had my fun with it and the little DLCs are actually quite worth their money.I give a Call of Duty Ghosts a 6/10.It was toootally not the worst game of 2013 and iam actually excited for a Sequel of this ""Timeline"""

On one of the first trailers for Ghosts, it said from 'the creators of the Modern Warfare series'... that alone really hyped me up. And then when I found out that the writer of Traffic (Stephen Gaghan) wrote this, that also drew more of my  excitement.When it finally got released, I finished the game in 6 hours. I then played it again to achieve all 40 in-game achievements. After that, I moved on to Mulitplayer. My favorite feature is Extinction. I maxed out my rank in that, and now aiming to get all achievements. Then going to go for the rest of the Muliplayer features.I'm 20, a university student in York University, Canada.I study Computer Science, Digital Media, and FIlm.I love this game. I honestly don't see why there is so much hate going on.I have fast internet and don't get any lag. As for Visuals, I play on a laptop, with low settings, and I still don't complain. I don't know why the critics are so harsh. This game blew my mind. The campaign story was great, the improved engine and visuals are second to none.

It is poorly optimized (the 6 GB of RAM fiasco was just the start of things) and does not even look that spectacular. The one redeeming quality of the game is its single-player campaign, which I found to be rather interesting and offering a new perspective of the typically hard-hitting US military force we have come to expect from Call of Duty titles. If you actually play the single-player campaigns of Call of Duty games, then Ghosts might be a decent addition to your collection, but for those who only play multiplayer, there is absolutely no point of buying this game. 10/10 would not buy."

,Not Recommended,209160,30163203,Posted: 25 February,all,Neutron John,"Call of Duty Ghosts Campaign ReviewI think for most people Call of Duty Ghosts was the breaking point. Some of the first fans jumped ship after Modern Warfare and some others were tired by Modern Warfare 3, but Ghosts is probably the first time that collectively as a whole people were just like enough is enough. I think for the most part I agree, but out of the context of it being the umpteenth COD game and in the context where you are going to choose which COD to buy without having any significant bias besides value proposition overall gameplay, I’ll try to explain where I stand.On the technical side of things COD Ghosts is definitely the most realistic looking COD game from the old COD engine, which seems like it was used since COD 2 and wasn’t significantly changed until Advanced Warfare. Does it mean it look’s pretty? Sure, in some places, the environments and set pieces as always are beautifully rendered, but that’s probably where I would stop. Because it’s definitely one the most disappointing games graphically in recent memory. There are many telltale signs that this engine was creaking by this go around. It’s lighting and effect, while great looking are really outdated looking compared to any of it’s contemporaries or even games that were released at the same time. To top it off I would assume that it runs like crap. I had drops in my framerate when things got really crazy, which is disappointing on a GTX 970. Overall, the graphics don’t hold up at all for the most part.Going into the story itself is quite honestly pointless. For one the game ends on a cliffhanger and so becomes one of the COD’s to not have a definitive ending to it’s story, which makes it pointless, and not only that, but rips too many things wholesale from better written and told stories in Hollywood. For one, halfway through the game, the main villain gives himself up in what I shall now call “The Joker cliche” (For reference, look at how easily Joker gives himself up to Batman in Dark Knight and just see how much have tried and failed to copy it into their stories.) Then he proceeds to do something that is very much in the vein of Bane from the intro of The Dark Knight Rises and from then on it feels as if COD Ghosts doesn’t have an wholly original idea for the most part. The game starts in a mostly post-apocalyptic setting, but soon forgets about it and never returns to it or says anything meaningful with it. For half the game it feels like you’re just playing a typical modern shooter and not some post-apocalyptic shooter. To top all this off, the main villain’s motivation never seems to go past, “I must repay what you did to me.” It ends up being shallow and quite boring.All of this isn’t to say that the campaign itself isn’t entertaining. It is for the most part and in some ways better than Modern Warfare 2 or 3, but in the end the game can’t seem to choose what it wants to be or say. It makes it feel like a thoroughly useless entry that although is not as bad as Modern Warfare 2 or 3 it’s pretty darn close. I have to say that at this point, if it wasn’t clear to you that Infinity Ward was a shell of it’s former self, then this games slaps you across the face with it. So it goes to say that when counting value proposition, performance, replayability and other things, I really can’t recommend COD: Ghost to anybody, but the most ardent of fans."

Now to the review.Graphics/OptimizationThis is a decent looking game, personally i find Black Ops 2 better looking but thats just my opion. This game is poorly optimized, FPS is locked, FOV is locked and must be modififed, graphics look great but if you have a low end card and have to play the game on LOW.Don't play it. On low settings, its very blurry and looks like a PS2 game.Overall: 5/10GameplayGameplay plays like any COD. Basic fast action shooting. The guns don't seem very balanced. The shot guns are very powerful, while the machine guns can take up to a full clip. They added a new slider feature which is nice, but you can't shoot while sliding making it pointless. Snipers have a new scope, which is ok. but i prefer the old ones better.  It now has a new point system where you earn squad points which result in buying guns and attachment. I feel like earning squad points is hard and takes too long. The Maps are now Battlefield TDM Sized which feels too big for 12 people. Alien mode takes over zombies, but it slow and repetative with only one map.Overall:7/10In the end, this is a game you can pass on. The new features are not worth it and the new Alien mode is less then steller.Plus it runs terribly, even on 2 Titans."

East apparently being totally wasted, this game revolvers around North America versus South America (The Federation). The protagonist is totally silent again and has no personality beyond simply being badass, which allows any player to relate themselves with him. His brother has two voice modes: non-emotional silent   droning (phrase ""All this time you've been a Ghost"" is the hit) and non-emotional yelling. The sole black Ghost dies first. The Ghosts themselves are described as supernaturally silent warriors, whose tactics involve blowing stuff up and ramming the front gates with their vehicle. The mosquito buzz is FRIGHTENINGLY REALISTIC. The dog is undoubtedly the most charismatic and well-written character. And may gods have mercy on you in case you FORGET RILEY! Also, the campaign mode has no FoV slider, which keeps you stuck in ""couch"" mode at 65, and zero-tolerance policy for the external FoV changers.Multiplayer has quite a wide array of customizing your character. It has a free option to make you char female, with a selection of uniforms (no revealing sexy ones, thankfully) and hats/helmets, most of which are acquired through completing the usual grinding challenges, and of course the DLC ones. You can also buy more DLCs to customize your playercard, change the announcer to Snoop Dogg, and morph your overpowered killer dog into an overpowered killer wolf. You can also buy even more DLCs to gain access to exclusive overpowered weapons, and get more map packs. At the first sight, it is the same Call of Duty gameplay with random explosives, one-hit knife kills, one-shot-to-the-body sniper kills, dropshots (spot an enemy, lie down, shoot them in the legs), and SMG dominance. This includes the usual questionable balance decisions: Bizon has 36 rounds instead of 53/64, while Vepr - which isn't even an SMG - has 40 in its 30-round magazine, Beretta has 12 rounds instead of 15, Grach has 10 instead of 18 AND is underpowered, the marksman rifle mags are the worst offenders. Oh, and at this time, only 150-250 players are active, and ONLY in team deathmatch. As a bonus, you can set the FoV to a maximum of 80, because anything higher apparently makes your high-end machine stutter even MORE.This Call of Duty entry demonstrates that terrible game dev decisions can, in fact, kill the franchise. The biggest bonus in this game? When you remove it, you free up almost 40 GB of space."

I refused to buy CoD: Ghosts, until it went on sale and a friend recomended it...I played the multi player awile: same. Few changes, you still have the l33ts runnin around killing expertly. Then the hackerbabies cheating to kill everyone... along with the game.You win killstreaks and slaughter the other team. And you get a dog after 5 kills.The Extinction game is really fun co-op. You and up to 3 friends must fight through waves of creatures to a nuke you must set off then get to the choppa! It is a flurry of action! You upgrade one of your character 's loadouts- 4 available- weapon specialist- tank- engineer and medic. they all have specialties to upgrade in game to boost you and your team while fighting. You all unlock options to your loadout through ranking up... and they help alot!!You must place a drill machine on large plant like creatures that kills them in a few minutes time but other very mobile creatures try to stop it. You have to fight off these monsters. I don't think they are aliens but things from deep underground that the rods from the single player's space based weapons unearthed. Anyway its good shooty fun.The single player returns to the epic stoytelling I missed in Black Ops- and didn't buy with Black Ops 2.You are one of two brothers that must fight to survive after the main bad guy attacks... everyone. The South American countries unite to wage all out war on the U.S.A.Your father was in an elite unit called the Ghosts... how did I know that? And now they are tasked with stopping the evil doer's plans.The game travels from small town U.S.A. through jungles, cities and into space with every set stage expertly created. Infinity Ward does an great job making the stages ""feel"" real. You must fight while fixed to a rope on the side of a skyscraper, under water in a sunken ship with sharks swimming around you, on the back of a semi raceing over frozen water, on the deck of a listing air craft carrier, in a space suit assulting an orbiting satilite and on the top of a fast moving mag train.I am a huge fan of this series I realized after the credits rolled... Only if Infinity Ward is at the helm.I recommend this game for the single player and co-op.The multi-player is fun too but it is the same hacker infested fragfest as ALL the others before it- just new maps.-GrAnD"

But after a lot of hate did they  step up with Ghosts ? In Call Of Duty Ghosts you play as Logan. America is caught in a middle of war which is staged by one man named Rourke who was a former Ghost gone rogue. So how is this game ? Overall this is game is not good. Now overall COD has been know for over the top action sequence that make you feel like youre in a movie. But ghosts feels almost like Infinity ward was tired and didnt even bother making it any good. So the game is excatly the same as previous COD games so you know the not much diffrent. Overall there are a few problems that i have with this game in particular. The game is sloppy. The Pc port is garbage, the textures are garbage and dont look anything like next gen and they barely look last gen. The games combat feels slopier while it feels more fast paced. The game adds a slide mechanic which doesnt do all that much just lets you get to cover quicker. The game has a few plusses but nothing too much. The sound quality is great and it has a few fun missions. But lets cover the reason why people play Call of Duty the multiplayer. The multiplayer is probably the worst one yet. The server issues occur often and really just draw you out of the game. boring maps. broken spawn system as always and extinction mode which is Blops zombies with aliens instead. Overall i didnt enjoy Call Of Duty Ghosts at all. I really suggest you stay away from COD in general because this franchise is dead and we all know it. I give Call Of Duty Ghosts a 4,5/10"
,Not Recommended,209160,26510338,"Posted: 9 November, 2016",all,SPi,"The hate on this game is understandable in the aspect of Multiplayer.Singleplayer:But in the aspect of Singleplayer I can say it was a decent enough try.The Campaign resembled Modern Warfare serries in many aspects as it was inspired from them in the first place. Missions were cool, Music was amazing, characters were not great but okay, story was a bit fantacy but it was okay, weapons were cool, the space element was not realistic which looked a bit off but it was a bit fun. I really liked the campaign. Not loving it like MW2 but liked it a lot.Multiplayer:Why? Just why? So many bright ideas about customization, innovations and awesome fun game changing rules. All done wrong. It feels off. Bad balance, bad optimization. Game takes 30 secons to launch. Maps are boring. Free Fall was innovative but not great. Uniforms were so limited and boring. Nothing really attractive. Customization lacks a lot of stuff and should be a lot different.Squads:Squads was okay, safeguard is a cheap copy of MW3 survival which means that the devs are out of ideas. Squads matches were cool, making your own soldiers the way you want and make them fight with you. That's cool. Nice. But other than that, not much to say on Squads.Extinction:The gameplay setup has so many potentials. Clearing nests/hives to move to the next area. Good idea for gameplay. But I hate to see in my realism-wannabe game aliens and stupid unreasonable creatures. This ruhined the extinction gameplay feel for me. Totally sucks to see stupid unreasonable creatures/aliens fight you. And let's try to find some logic. So some extraterrestrial creatures, are NAKED and they travel noumerous light years into space in the form they are shown in the game... Just think about it. How did an organic creature survive outter space without technological protection? I think this covers everything.A Point:Now here is a question that will prove how Call of Duty developers HATE their game.Call of Duty Ghosts was out in 2013. The First Call of Duty was released in 2003.So COD Ghosts was released in the 10th anniversary of COD. WHY did developers bother to do stupid aliens and unreasonable♥♥♥♥♥♥instead ofCALL OF DUTY 1 REMASTERED???I'll tell you why:Because they are out of ideas and they hate their own game.That's all I had to say.

I've tried multiplayer too (usually my highlight of CoD games) and it is completely dead. There is nothing good about this title. It's almost as though Roland Emmerich or Michael Bay directed this game.The game is full of AWFUL low-res textures that would look at home on a PS1 game (I'm not kidding here, they're everywhere too, and very noticable, view my screenshots if you do not believe me). Dull gameplay, not fun at all. There were no great or thrilling set-pieces, just constant drudgery through endlessly-respawning enemies. Ridiculous setting and story. Constant cheesy dialogue and ludicrous plotlines. The campaign isn't fun at all and the story is totally stupid. You'd think it was written by a teenager as CoD fan-fiction.Multiplayer is totally dead. I wouldn't even recommend this on a sale, because it's really that bad.

A near-future setting, futuristic weapons, decent maps and a fun and interesting Pick 10 system combined to create a game that I lost over a hundred hours in. Something that absolutely made this experience is that Black Ops II's PC port was handled MARVELOUSLY. Treyarch did an excellent job of porting it, with an FOV slider up to 90 FOV, decent-good textures, and tight controls.Call of Duty: Ghosts, is objectively inferior in a number of ways. The FOV is hardlocked at 65,  menus are insanely slow, people are having trouble running the game at 60 on a GTX TITAN, they've removed Theatre Mode, and, most important of all, the game feels absolutely horrible. In BO2, if you were being shot at, you had a chance to turn around, or outmaneuver your opponent, and shoot back to get a fair fight. In Ghosts, you are downed almost immediately after your opponent starts firing.Throughout all this, Ghosts still manages to have SOME decent ideas. The gun sounds are just as good as in Black Ops II, the maps are the biggest in the series (for better or worse), and there are some interesting gamemodes that help shake things up.For the love of Zeus, do not buy this game. I thought that the PC port would be decent-good; but this port is honestly WORSE than Modern Warfare 3's. In fact, when Black Ops II goes on sale for thirty dollars, you go ahead and buy it. Seriously, it's a good game. If you ever do get it, send me a message. I'll play some games with you and try to get the shame of spending sixty dollars on this absolute trash. Don't make the same mistake I did."

The online was plagued by frame-rate stuttering  and other problems. Since then, however, the game has been updated and most of the framereate issues have been esolved. Unfortunately, the online play is still plagued by lag and other network issues.Further, the ""innovations"" that were promised are either so negligible that they are pointless, or they damage the online play. For example, one of the kill streaks gives you a dog as your companion who rushes players and kills them. Unfortunately, these dogs rule the gameplay for the most part and you will find yourself dying by dogs way too frequently.While camping has always plagued FPSs, COD: Ghosts brings it to a new level; Where in past games campers were usually easy to detect, the new enviroments in this new installment are seemingly designed with camping in mind. There are bushes, coves, cubbies, windows, holes, and sniper roosts to an absurd level. To make matters worse, Ghosts even goes as far as to offer dedicated campers ghilie suits to better camp out. To compound all of the above, silencers' usual negative consequences have been removed which has caused the prolieration of their use. It is not uncommon to have a match where upwards of 75% of the players are using silenced weapons."

After playing this game for some months now I am going to recommend this game despite the many negative reviews and publicity it got. If you are true Call of Duty fan I would recommend this game to players. Now looking at the system requirements I would STRONGLY ADVISED that you pay attention to the RECOMMENDED SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS if you want the best gameplay experience. Let's face it you cannot expect to run a ""NexGen Game"" on ""LastGen"" hardware: it just would not work. Now let's look at the pros and cons of this game.Pros.1. Solid Single Campaign. Good Storyline.2. Various game modes to play in multiplayer.3. Various customization on guns, loadouts, characters etc.4. New gameplay mechanic in multiplayer for example  fewer shots to kill your opponents online.5. New game modes added such as SafeGuard, Squads & Extinction which is really fun.6. A lot Of Downloadable Content  especially for Season Pass holders allowing for more longevity of the game.7. Stellar Graphics providing that you meet the below Recommended system requirements.8. A Clan mode feature which is a Call of Duty first. Ideally for competitive players.Cons.1. The system requirements can be a huge barrier to most PC owners seeing that they may not have the budget to meet those system requirements.2. An Unoptimized game. Based on the COD community it is said that people who have average to high end systems they reported that their game was giving problems on max settings.3. Hackers still exists in this game. Probably one of main reasons why the community doesn't have much players. Which leads to point...4. Hard to find players on all game modes. You find players on TDM, Domination, Kill Confirm and S & D5. Surprisely this game doesn't have a ""Ping indicator"" like its predecessors.I know a lot of people might disagree with this recommendation but I am personally having fun with this game especially the DLC and its customization. I personally believe that this game is a great game and it would have been better if weren't for hackers destroying the COD community gameplay experience."

And the second time you run it, and the third. For me it took about 20 times and now the game is running perfectly, and I mean it. It just took a while to get there. I  don't play multiplayer so I cant tell you about that, but the campaign runs like a perfected cod campaign a good combination of everything, Sometimes you feel like you are playing a world war 2 campaign, the next you are in the movie gravity combined with the action from transformers and war of the worlds. This is what I play games for. Not to long, doesn't suck you in, in an unhealthy way, but still provides you with a blast of an experience.

It's not the gameplay, but the technical problems that are killing this game for me. For one, the lag (or is it the lag compensation) is truly unacceptable. You might expect to see some tiny differences between what you experience in game and what you get back from the kill cam, but in Ghosts I often experience quite significant differences. For instance when sneaking up on an enemy from behind, shooting at him as he turns, in the kill cam shot my opponent has already turned completely and was able to shoot me down without showing any shots fired from my side. The second problem are spawn points. Even after the patch I often find myself only a few feet away from an enemy as you spawn. I know Infinity Ward and Treyarch are not sharing the same bed, but maybe they should team up to fix these kind of problems once and for all, because now I feel like they are trying to reinvent solutions to the same problem with each release. For now I'm back to Black Ops 2. This game might not be free of technical problems as well, but it is way better than with Ghosts. Good luck out there and game on!!!"

This is a polished game with very few bugs, one of the best CoD games they've put together.  The multiplayer is just what CoD is known for, smaller maps with consistant action and good objective based team play on game modes like Blitz and Domination.  There's some great new game modes like Search and Rescue (think of Search and Destroy only you can revive your teammates), Bliz (which is like a CTF mode but you only need to make it to the enemy base), and they've added all the old favorites like TDM and even Gun game.  There's also a few squad based co-op modes worth checking out, and a pretty decent singleplayer, with over the top Michael Bay explosions, overly dramatic world ending storyline, and playable dogs!It's worth checking out.  To be completely objective, the one problem the game has it that it does suffer from hackers, there' quite a few in multiplayer.  While outright hacking like aimbots and shooting through walls is exceedingly rare, wall hacking is pretty common.  Fortunately most of these people are terrible even if they're wall hacking and you can frag them all the same, so it's typically not completely gamebreaking, but can be frustrating."

They attempted to make it more realistic like Battlefield, but I liked the non-realism that was given in Black Ops 2. I do not recommend buying this. In fact, you should just buy Black Ops 2 with the money that you saved towards this game, or wait for the upcoming one made by Treyarch. Infinity Ward also had terrible quality and support for PC players in comparison to the PS3, PS4, Xbox360 and Xbox One. There are a lot less players on the PC version of Ghosts than others."

,Recommended,209160,9350220,"Posted: 5 March, 2014",all,Tyler Abbott,"I don't mind this game. Personally, the reviews are very misleading in terms of being generically 'bad'. However, even though I'm relatively new to PC gaming still, I do notice the poor optimization for PC gamers. The story is worth playing and the multiplayer has plenty of potential for being a source of hours entertainment. The reason I say 'potential' is because the player base is God awful as your only going to find matches in 'Team Deathmatch' and whatever other mode is flavourful at the moment. I really wish the 'Infected' mode had more players, or if there were just more players playing this game in general so I would be able to truly experience the multiplayer has to offer. All in all, I believe Call of Duty: Ghosts is a fine game, and I can see myself playing the Singleplayer through for the storyline and fun missions. I DO NOT THINK THIS GAME IS WORTH $59.99 THOUGH. From taking a sneak peek at the new DLC 'Onslaught', I don't think that's worth $14.99 either."

I upgraded my machine to try to get better performance out of the game still all in all it has bad coding. MW3 IMO is a better looking game. As for Valves Anti Cheat Software the hole that was used for MW3 hacks has been implemented in this game as well I'm sure all the hackers from MW3 migrated to Ghost and are not shy about being caught. Why? Good question I suppose nothing is ever done to those who cheat. This is just from what I have seen maybe the cheaters are being removed and they are coming back again and again with new steam accounts I don't know for sure, but I see them the same ones over and over. Unless you want to run a private match and just play with a group of friends who you know don't cheat then you will enjoy the multiplayer part of the game. The game shutters in the lobby and isn't constant some days its fine and others are real bad. Certain video card drivers are know for their display drivers to crash. So my rating for this game is a negative rating. This maybe my last Call of Duty game I'll buy unless I see a change in the fanchise. Dedicated Servers ! Punkbuster Anticheat Software !"

The language during the credits were especially foul, however, but easy enough to simply turn it off if you're like me and prefer actual maturity over ""mature"" content. The audio was a bit of a problem during cut scenes/loading. It would chop in and out and requires Vertical Sync to be turned off to fix it. I'm rather disappointed that they didn't catch and fix that bug. All in all, I think it was very well done and worth the play if you like FPS games and quality realism of environment."

The Single Player Campaign can be a little cliché at times but it is still pretty engaging as the characters develop. The Extinction mode is fun too as it is a different experience to Zombies and deginately much better than the survival modes they had in MW3/MW2. Multiplayer is where the problems start to show. This game is meant to be a fast paced arcade style shooter but since there are only 6 vs 6 on PC and the maps are huge, it is slow paced. The high end PC statement I said earlier really shows on the MP modes as this game is unoptimized and with a middle tier PC you will find yourself having extremely unbareable framerates and you will find yourself getting killed around corners or from people who aren't even on your screen. It is a nice change to the franchise and it is a superior game compared to the recent Black Ops 2 and Modern Warfare 3. The only thing that is a set back to the PC version is mainly the unoptimization but it can be solved by having a high end graphics card such as a Titan or a GeForce GTX760."

This game is good in it's own way but everyones negativity turned it into a flop, sure the game isnt perfect but its alright. I enjoy extinction mode which is not the same as zombies, its very interesting to play through. The campaign was kinda dragged out but some parts I loved, multiplayer wasn't very good.. Mainly the bad weapon damage scales.. But! The introduction of dynamic environments in the maps (thats a difference in this cod game) giving players new strategies to kill their enemy. The next gen engine (another difference) is amazing yet badly optimized to make people think it actually does require a gtx760+, i ran this fine, med-hi settings, 35fps on my 2yr old 650ti which crashes alot.In conclusion: I wouldnt buy this until its on sale, its not good enough for its price.

Although Ghosts is a somewhat decent game, there is a lack of support on the PC side of things. Sometimes you will get into hacked lobbies, no FOV slider, poor optimization, and just a lack of fixed makes this game a pretty bad port. If you have a console too and are debating on which platform to get Ghosts on go with your console, but if you only play PC and still want to experience CoD, there is a FOV mod out there which I'm almost positive won't get you banned and if you lower some settings or have some pretty decent hardware the game still runs fluidly. So in all, it's not a must have addicting game, but generally not too bad either. The campaign was very good as well. It took me 6 hours to complete, but if you're better than I am you can probably finish in 4.

This one included. The Campaign mode is just like every other CoD since the first one. It just feels like a expansion for Black Ops though. Yes there are some space and underwater battle scenes, building rappelling, tank, helicopter, a remote-control dog scene, and a monorail scene complete with shaky ground that breaks up the typical formula's poke-your-head-out-and-get-shot-dead-from-out-of-nowhere monotony that you've all come to know. I just don't think the mixed gameplay is enough to save it however. Graphically, the game looks amazing... but it's the SAME GAME and with the gaming graphics plateauing across the industry, this is just not good enough any more. I'm just too old for this now.The campaign plot itself is a new low for incredibly B-movie styled hokey, with no self-effacing gag to at least give a knowing wink to the silliness. The plot only feels tacked on to give some measure of weak cohesion with all the set-pieces. I have to wonder with the billions in sales why Activision can't afford to bother some best-selling military fiction writers to pen something with some more thematic substance and maturity... something that gets me thinking about things more than ""war is bad"". At least with the early Call of Duty games, I got to learn about the battles of WW2. Now? ...I just learn about some futuristic wank.However, we all know that most CoD players come for the multiplayer, right? Well, this is always the game's saving grace because it's pretty much the only thing people buy the game for. There are some interesting modes here. Extinction is a kind of mash up of what make CoD Zombies good, except that the aliens are not scary and just annoying. For more 4 player fun, try the squads Safeguard mode. This proves to be similar to MW2's enjoyable survival modes, and is a lot of fun, with my only complaint that you can't play solo with AI like you can with extinction.In short... Activition is just going to keep making these games because they make a boatload of money with each generation of new players. I waited until I got this on steam discount because I no longer believe that it's worth the silly dollars they're asking at launch.... but having said that, if you're a CoD junkie it's pretty much an essential purchase. You'll buy it anyway... just like the next installment, and even if they replace all the guns with poo-flingers for the inevitable sequel."

There are limited video options and inconsistant settings where on one extra is the max and on another high is. There is no FOV (field of view) slider so a 3rd party program is needed to get more than a 65FOV. The audio options are one slider, no seperate options for Music, game, voices ect. No FPS shower to see fps, Dedicated servers are hit and miss sometimes you are on them but mostly you end up on p2p servers. The game itself looks terrible considering the strain it puts on my hardware, BF4 on ultra 1920x1080 which looks incredible i get 90FPS+ but on this the max settings still have really low resolution and looks terrible as well as the terrible performance. There have been 2 patches that have done nothing really the game still isn't smooth to play, FPS is not consistant and all round isn't a Call of Duty experience.

It attempts to portray the USA as a fallen power, but can't bring itself to actually disempower the player. So you're still the most powerful faction in all the battles, with the USA showing off its massive air power and tank force all over the game, despite the story hammering you over the head with how weak the USA is now and how all-powerful the enemy coalition is.The story is actually pretty decent in the first half, but gets mind-numbingly stupid towards the end, with a frankly insulting ending. Also includes some horribly racist plot points, including a white American supervillain who's the *real* mind behind the Latin American superpower, which is actually only strong because they hijacked a US superweapon."

But saying that many have left because Infinity Ward/Activision have not patched the PC version to a level of quality expected by a large percentage of players.Myself, I have played to Presetige 3 now (180+ levels) and have a pretty good idea of the maps and playstyles.  The secret spots, how to appraoch a camper without getting shot again, the loadouts I like etc.  I still play every night with clan members since launch and we all have fun.But there are two things you have to ignore in the game.1. Hackers.  You WILL see them, they are very obvious after a few presteiges under your belt as you know what is possible and what is not.  Do not cry hacker until you understand every perk in the game as it is usually a false claim.  If you see one, and I am starting to know them all by name now!  Say in chat ""Enjoy an empty game because of hacker xyz"" then leave taking your clan (6 people) with you and report them (again).2. Cry babies and there are lots of them, take it with a pinch of salt and play  how you like (camping, run, spray whatever wins the match for your team).  You will get called names, you will be accused of everything under the sun and you will get reported even if your innocent.  Just ignore em.The only other thing I would say is that some lobbies are very far away and you get a terrrible ping.  You only find this out halfway through a map as there is no ping indicator.  This can lead to a frustrating game where you can't seem to kill anybody.  So, pull out the lobby after the game ends and search again.But, get in a good clan and have fun.  It is there."

The story was terribly bland, there was no special feature or change about it from other Call of Duties, and it’s multiplayer is pretty much dead. Usually when I write a review, I can make a pretty good arguments for how it is good or bad, and add my personal 2 cents for the verdict to let you know if I think others should play it or not.

It's not due to the game's difficulty, but part of it is the programming.  Twice the game crashed, loading screen froze three times in a row that prompted me to restart my computer, frame rate drops, idiotic AI that stop in front of you and you can't go around them, and enemy AI that focus all their fire on you and can hit you while only a portion of your body is exposed from 50 yards away while your partner AI is 25 yards away and firing at them as they stand in the open and can't hit them.What's worse, the campaign is boring and predictable.  There's not real engaging characters and those that might become interesting, like Astronaut Mosley, are killed off in just a few minutes.  Having a portion of the campaign in Space would have made things interesting.  Not just a run and gun, but trying to figure out things in a 3D and weightless enviroment while watching the world below descend into chaos, listening to the radio chatter as frantic people either encourage you or explain what's happening around them.  That would have been a good injection of fun, but instead we have a linear run-and-gun campaign with a few different gadgets attached.  I mean, after so many games in this franchise, we still can't even take enemy prisoners.  No.  We just have to kill everyone!  That gets dull for me.I know how the game ends, I know who Rourke is and how it all ties together even though I only have a few hours playing it and I know what happens at the end.

Most of the DLC maps however get rid of this and look and play absolutely fantastic.For a traditional and modern CoD it has the by far best weapon selection and overall the loadouts that you can create are great. They added and refined a lot of great things to what is essentially MW3.Exodus is really fun and good. The bots are really fun and good. Its the last CoD before supply drops and the coins to unlock thigns are great.If you can get it cheap in a local store its definitely worth it. The campaign was ok for an interactive action movie and was fun at times. The campaign never got bad but yeah its certainly not as good as the Modern Warfare ones.The DLC maps are absolutely worth it and they come with new guns and new Exodus levels as well.The bots are really well done and feel very much like humans so technically you really don't need others to enjoy this game.

But there is only one level and it looks like a new level will come out for extinction with ever round of DLC, which means three or four more DLC's at 14.99, which would bring this game to a total cost of $60 + (4 x $15) = $120.I can tell you right now, it is not worth it."

However, after REMOVING old video drivers and installing the newest, then setting the game to run at normal priority I habve played many hours lag free and at the highest settings. My computer is not a late and great. I have an AMD 6 core at 3.0 Mhz and 2 HD-6850's and 6 Gigs ram on Win 7 x64. Not to much above minimum specs.The Game:SP - I only have a few hours logged in SP but so far the story line is IMHO pretty decent. I have had no bugs (others have reported bugs) and the missions have gone smoothly other than my own mistakes.MP - Maps are a variety of CQB and large sniper maps. Have not seen nearly as many hackers as others have been complaining about, but I have seen less than a handful. I am enjoying the maps. I however wish that dedicated servers would be in the next patch, but I doubt we will ever get them.Kits - Soldier and kit building is far superior to previous titles allowing for full customization of your soldier. The ability to create multiple soldiers and level them up for squad play is interesting and something I am just now starting.GraphicsMeh. When at full settings the graphics are decent but not worthy of next-gen branding. Destructible enviroments could be described as a very few destructible objects. BF3 even had almost full destructable environments (buildings, etc.) Do not expect this in Ghosts. For a ""next-gen"" game I expected more, way more...I'ld give this game 7/10.

,Recommended,209160,7750275,"Posted: 25 November, 2013",all,Ferrum Chiroptera,"A great entry to the Call of Duty series.  Updated graphics, an improved sound engine, reworked character creation,  larger maps,  and a return to old school gameplay make this title a winner.The graphics have seen some pretty serious improvements, especially in single player.  They're not the earth shattering improvements that many expected with the announcement of a ""new engine"" but obvious improvements nonetheless.  Better lighting engine, improved particles, tessellation, sub-d enhancements that are especially evident in character models all bring something more to the table.  Ignore those who claim that the engine has remained unchanged.  They literally have no idea what they're talking about.The sound engine has especially been upgraded.  Enemy footsteps are clear as a bell, without any sort of enhancements.  With just about any headset, it's easy to tell when a heavy-footed enemy is sprinting towards your location.  More experienced players will crouch walk or use dead silence to approach undetected.  This effect is really enhanced when the amplify perk is equipped.Character creation has been completely retooled.  Everything is customizable from gender, race, uniforms, patches, headgear, you name it.  Along with this the new perk system is much more dynamic than previous entries in the series.  Gone are the days of 3 (comparatively) powerful perks, and in their place are a multitude of perks that while alone do less, but when combined offer countless permutations.A welcome change, or rather a welcome return for the Call of Duty series.  Much less emphasis on run'n'gun and more emphasis on  tactical game play on much larger maps.  Gone is the Treyarch 3 route map making paradigm, and in it's place is a multitude of flanking routes on large, much more open maps.  Fans of lightweight SMG play are likely to be disappointed, but fans of just about everything else will be thrilled to death.What makes this game really shine though is the return of gun play.  Killstreaks have been seriously nerfed across the board. Rather than the killer airs support that has marked the series since MW2, this game offers lethal kill streaks more along the lines of the Cobra or Hind from MW1.  While they still get a few kills, they're not same rewards as in later games.  Explosives are less powerful, with absolutely no way to replenish during a life.  Instead, this game has returned to gun play, and not pray and spray SMG or shotgun play, but a return of the assault rifle as the dominant weapon, with plenty of room for snipers and marksman rifles as well.  Those looking for cheap exploits like the grenade launcher + OMA from MW2 should look elsewhere.."

The game runs smoothly at 60 FPS with all settings at high / ultra in both single player and multiplayer.The single player campaign, though short, goes a long way towards putting you into the feel of a special operations team member with missions ranging from underwater combat to base infiltration to space combat. While the story itself is fairly straightfoward and reminiscint of a hollywood summer action flick, it's still enjoyable.The multiplayer is where the game stands out compared to previous call of duty titles. The level designs are larger and much more complete in terms of accessibility and realism of buildings as well as other objects. Firing through cracks in objects will not cause bullet collision with invisible walls which is quite nice. Another major bonus is the removal of a large portion of the aerial kill streak rewards, bringing the fight back down to a groundwar rather than constant map bombardments by overpowered rewards.The people who are complaining about the performance of this game are putting on display a fault of their own machine hardware rather than a fault with the game itself. Because this game was designed for so-called ""next generation"" hardware, it is odd to expect it to still run smoothly on outdated setups.While the game is not extreme in it's innovations within multiplayer, the addition of more movement possibilities such as sliding and vaulting allows for a deeper level of immersion as the usual bunny hop and run and gun mentality which is too often seen in CoD titles has been all but eliminated. In it's place are players willing to take a more serious tactical approach to gun combat. While this does lead to a slower pace in matches, it also adds a better sense of realism and immersion which is seriously lacking in previous Call of Duty titles."

This allows people who haven't played the game, to make a review of it after watching a trailer.Now onto the game. It has an OK story. Lackluster at points. Very fun at others. Kind of an enjoyable story. Then theres multiplayer. Multiplayer is suprisingly good this time. This is the first time I've played on PC only, compared to all other CoD's where I've played on console. The community is rather nice, and very competetive. Not full of 9 year olds like everyone says. A new addition, more of a zombies clone is Extinction. I haven't played much Extinction, but it is really fun. Different than zombies enough, but still feels like it.Overall, I'd give this game a 7.5/10. It could of been 9, but bad pricing.Buy it if you want or have the money. Worth more like 40 dollars, but still a very fun game."

The bottom like here is that this is an IW Call of Duty game. If you've played one in the past, you preeeety much know what you're getting into. If you've enjoyed their previous games, you'll likely enjoy this one too. It's nothing groundbreaking, but like a summer blockbuster, it has a few enjoyable set-pieces and the action is tight and satisfying as always. I for one had a lot of fun with the single player campaign, which is usually my main reason for getting these games. I experienced none of the bugs and glitches everyone else seemed to be complaining about, so either they've patched these up or it was never all that bad in the first place. My guess is a little of both.So, bottom line, let the haters hate. If you like CoD, this will be right up your alley. Just don't pay full price, wait for the next Steam sale to pick it up."

I have played through most of the single player campaign and found it runs perfectly on my gaming computer. I do not have some 3000$ computer... in fact I did not pay over 650 USD for the computer I have now. You could consider it a mid-level gaming computer. I do not run into lag spikes, or have a low frame rate. I can honestly say that I have no complaints about performance. I mostly play in extinction mode, but have tinkered in the other multiplayer modes. Extinction gets a 8/10 from me. It is unlike any other player vs AI experience that I have encountered in my ten years of PC gaming.

,Recommended,209160,8913786,"Posted: 30 January, 2014",all,Fraggenstein,This is a great game with many facets of gameplay. The campaign is great and adventurous. The graphics of the game are epic. The Multiplayer is as usual with enemy players spawning behind opponents which is the same classic flaw in game design as always was in the Call of Duty series as well as the allowance of a multitude of hackers inserting their hack codes into the game without reproach. The Multiplayer as well is the usual Run and Gun Nadefest and air attack/hackfest as usual and to me is not enjoyable for honest players. However their is a breath of fresh air in the other venues of the game. Squad Assault and especially Wargame is great co-op gaming except the rotating game thing. I would think you could specify if you wanted t play a particular game such as Team Deathmatch as opposed to be unwillingly shifted from game mode to game mode and as well the long waiting for the idiotic server rotation which is not working for anybody I've talked to. Not to mention that Steam downloaded some kind of update for online play and everytime it updates your stats the game locks up and quits. Then you have to reboot again and go through the long waiting process to  get into another server. They dropped the ball when they stopped the dedicated server option for this game. I like the game and I like the graphics but the above mentoned issues put a huge thorn into the side of a great game.  SOK Fraggenstein said it.  Spec Op Killers Elitewww.sok.spruz.com

I didn't get jack♥♥♥♥♥♥what was going on from the start. As a matter of fact, the SP campaign is pretty weird all the way through. It's all over the place, but still not in a terrible way. You are in space, you are in dense jungles, crawling around avoiding detection (just like the classic ""All ghillied up"" from CoD:MW), you are on high-speed-derailing trains, you drive tanks and helicopters and so on. Turns me off a little. Infinity Ward could have worked a bit harder on a proper story that follow a less rough path.I got the feeling that they just cherry-picked the most memorable pieces from their previous games and slapped a new skin over it and shipped the new Ghosts. This time you are in some kind of alternative future, like 70 years from now, but without the gadget-♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t from Black Ops 3 that I found somewhat questionable...So what saves CoD:Ghosts from falling short then? The gameplay. It's fun, it's tight, the difficulty is just right (on normal) They introduce the mechanics in a nice tempo. I played it on normal and it offered somewhat of a challange. Not like BO3, but I thought it was perfect since I'm not HaRDcoRe. I just wanna have fun.And the game looks really good for a CoD that is 4 years old. Decent amount of detail in the levels, decent amount of polys used, but the textures is to low res for my liking.TL;DR...- Solid gameplay.- Well balanced.- Tight controls.- Variety in the SP campaign. For good or bad...- Sluggish weapon handling and ""tame"" impact from them. For some reason, in this CoD, the weapons felt a bit like pee-shooters. I want more ""oomph"" in my guns when I murder bad guys all willie-nillie. (The rest of your actions suffers from the same weird behavior - throwing frags and so on - is sluggish... Really strange. What works tho - as it always has - is the movement. It's tight CoD-style.- I would prefer higher resolution textures tho. After playing BO3 or DOOM2016 this feels like a trip back in time. (which it is but anyway...)- ""Perfect length"" according to me, it did not overstay it's welcome, but I did NOT like the horrible cliffhanger that they leave you with at the end.- Imho, Ghosts is better then BO3 and maybe even BO2.Final verdict....Around 7.5/10 I would say, even if it has flaws like the (mostly) unsatisfying gunplay. The reason is simple. It was really fun to blast through the campaign. However, at it's current pricepoint of $50-60, I would recommend that you do some research of your own before pressing that Buy-button."
,Recommended,209160,22600385,"Posted: 23 April, 2016",all,lockmatt10101℠ 0R10N™,"To start the campaign. For a game ported to 5 different platforms two of which are running on very old tech, it's a great game that runs well on last gen and great on next. I saw many connections to the Modern Warfare series and other games, movies, etc while it still maintained originality. Almost like deja-vu the links to the old games created by Infinity Ward made the experience 10x better. While there are some things I don't like (like having the greatest villain from the show ""Chuck"" (aka Brandon Routh) be the brother of the protag Logan Walker.) it boiled down the a campaign that drew out the same feeling I had playing the MW series. I hope 2016 either ends or continues the storyline. Next, mulitplayer. Aas mostly a CS, TF2, Unturned, GMod gamer the big maps that all of these fams complained about made the game more enjoyable for a guy like me who can't win without having some breathing room and time between gunfights. The bot optimization in private matches, and the feature of being able to rank up with out going head to head with players who are masters at COD. Givng me time with my friends to hold the tide free from the typical ""COD kid"" group. With Extinction it brings a mulitplayer system breaks from the run-and-gun of the base game or any other COD game or gamemode. I advise for anyone who is considering buying AW or BO3 to buy this game instead. This is the true latest installment of COD till we see this year what IW has in store."

However, most of the campaign is repetitive - they just throw tons of enemies at you who stand behind cover and keep shooting at you like dumb AI. There is no intelligent AI like Last of Us which requires you to think - all you need to do is aim & shoot.Extinction is really fun though and is a great co-op mode.

I contacted Activiton and went on the community hum on Steam and all I am told is it's irreversable and they say I have breached one of their t&c's for fair play. What the actual f*ck?? Why would I rack up nearly 1000 hours to then decide to cheat?! Are they F*cking stupid? I think this is absolutely disgusting and I am totally enraged by this because they have given me no explanation whatsoever other than a link to their policy agreement which is total BS. I am so enraged I am now refusing to buy anything from these c*nts ever again.

76561197994194929,Recommended,209160,8937000,"Posted: 1 February, 2014",all,TheMadBlimper,"I'm going to admit that my kneejerk reaction to this game when it first came out was something less than positive. That being said, I gave it a few months, and I sat down and digested what occurred in the single player game itself. In addition, I took a closer look at how the game engine performs, and reached a few conclusions that weren't immediately apparent or obvious.I'll start with the game engine and the graphics overhaul that Ghosts brought to the CoD franchise. A lot of people are complaining that the game doesn't run that well in terms of frame rate. The reason for this is because they've set their graphics settings way too high. The console version certainly doesn't run the game in 1080p at max settings. Personally, I set the resolution lower (1440x900) and the graphics settings to ""high"" and the game runs a lot smoother (and looks much better) than it did at 1920x1200 with graphics at ""normal"". I'll post my PC build at the end of the review. Long story short, this game looks absolutely stunning at max graphics, but you need a top of the line video card with a lot of built-in RAM to run it well.And now for the single player campaign. At first, like many other people, I was disappointed in how generic the story seemed, and with how absurd the plot was at times. Then I actually started looking into all of the cute things IW put into the game, and I came to the conclusion that IW actually did their homework. Without spoiling anything, those crazy satellites in the game actually exist, along with a majority of the hardware presented in the game, heartbeat monitor notwithstanding. The story, on the other hand... at first glance, it seems like IW just threw something together with no idea where it was heading. Looking back on it, after having seen the extra cutscene you get after you beat the game on veteran, and taking it into context with the backstory we were presented with.... all I can say is, ""Wow."" Assuming IW doesn't chicken out of the next logical step in terms of plot, the next installment in the series is going to *completely* change the way you look at games. Allow me to explain:a large portion of the plot in single player is spent fighting the antagonist of the game, Rorke, who used to be a Ghost, himself. It is explained that he was *completely* devoted to fighting the Federation [the bad guys], but was captured, and vigorously tortured; he was tossed into a hole in the jungles of South America and fed food laced with various poisons. This completely destroyed him in every aspect, and when this was accomplished, the enemy (brainwashed) put him back together in their own image to go after the very people he used to work with. He also just so happens to do this extremely well. If you beat the game, you know that after the credits start to roll, you wind up back on the beach where the game ended, which promptly leads to Rorke showing up, beating the living daylights out of you, and dragging you off telling you that you're going to help him kill your friends. Now, the next bit only happens if you beat the game on veteran: there's an extra scene where you're the player again, and you're in a hole... in the middle of the jungle. So here's the kicker: IW may very well be leading up to a HUGE meta mind-@$%! showing you that *choice* in video games is an illusion, and you're forced to play the next installment fightingforthe bad guys.If IW manage to pull this off properly, well.... we'll see.No, the game didn't add anything really substantial as far as innovation goes, but the graphics overhaul does make the game look very pretty. If you enjoyed the Modern Warfare series and its gameplay, you'll enjoy this game. Is it a cinematic masterpiece? No. Is it entertaining? Yes. All in all, I feel that this game was deliberately generic because IW needed filler to properly setup the next game, which, if my guess is correct, should beextremelyentertaining. Do I recommend this game? Yes, but only if you've already played Modern Warfare 1, 2, and 3 and enjoyed them. If you haven't played those, go buy Modern Warfare and see what you think. If you enjoy it, move on up the ladder.PC build:AMD Phenom II 1100T Thuban O.C.'d @ 3.8GHzGigabyte GA-990FXA-UD7 motherboard16 GB of 1800MHz DDR3 RAMeVGA nVidia GTX 460 w/1GB of GDDR5 RAM4x 6.0GB/s SATA Raptor HDDs in a RAID 0 array"

Can't really say, I had alot of the issues other people had, myself. Purchasing this game is a very personal decision and you've got to ask yourself if you're willing to pay for more of the same, just slightly new/changed features. I did and I have quite some fun with it. Extended thoughts below!The PastThe CoD series will never return to their full glory. CoD 2 MP was incredibly well done and the game offered a nice single player campaign back then. When Modern Warfare came out, it boosted the series and it became even more popular due to the modern combat, at least it was more appealing to me after all the years of WW2 shooters. MW2 slightly topped it's predecessor, as it added more to the already awesome game that was Modern Warfare. It went downhill from there..BlackOps was okay but didn't nearly excite me as much as the MW did, MW3 was just a moneygrab and it all became more of the same.The PresentI was skeptical about the CoD:Ghosts release, expecting more of the same and even though this is probably also true, one way or another this games makes me feel alot like back when I played MW and MW2. What I like about Ghosts is the customization, the way it's done with the perks and attachments being unlocked with squadpoints regardless of your level, enables you to play with your favorite weapons, perks and attachments right from the start (pretty much). Operations and Clanwars are things that keep you playing, given you are in a clan (of at least 3 people) and actively participate in the weekly clan wars. Group up with some people if you want to get more satisfaction out of playing the game.What's a bit crappy about Ghosts is the optimization, even though I didn't have alot of the issues people encountered, I still feel the game doesn't run smooth, 60fps, but with occasional stutters or a screenfreeze, usually right at the moment you are trying to kill someone. Could get annoying and might get under your skin but it's just a minor annoyance, at least on my part. The hackers on the other hand (that recently started coming in) are quite annoying and reporting them is/feels useless.If you've been a fan of the CoD series in the past this game is certainly one to pick up (during a sale). Singleplayer is fastpaced and quite short, but that doesn't matter, it's really actionpacked and keeps you entertained the entire way. Multiplayer feels like MW2 to me but alot of 'new' or rather changed features make it a better version of MW2. The addition of integrated clans and clanwars makes the replayvalue slightly higher."

This games graphics are atrocious. Makes the minecraft look like the mona lisa. Story isnt that bad and I have no lag or freezing whatsoever. Guns feel bland and dull, every gun feels the same and shoots the same really. AI is a joke with 3 methods: 1) Be in the open and die. 2) Throw a grenade which btw, the grenade indicator looks like it came from CoD 1, and yes the explosion is very little and it does instant kill. 3) Bash you 2 times quickly killing you.

Most reviews are published by the community, who show to be seriously disabled of making a decent review with their ""COD is bad"" and their angry mob of weak-minded followers. I for one will be one of the first ones to shine a decent review on COD Ghosts into detail other than ""Ghosts sux, best uninstall simulator"" and all that BuIIshi†.You see, I love COD and I was loyal to it since the first Call of Duty was released. But I'm afraid, that this is the last COD I will have bought because Advanced Warfare seems to be... not anymore Call-of-Duty like and has proven to have countless amount of bugging bugs.Let me show you my rig and my performance first:OS:Windows 8.1 Pro 64-bitMotherboard:ASUS M4N78 ProCPU:AMD Phenom 2 X 4 945 Processor (4*3 GHz)RAM:6 GB @ 800 MHzGPU:Gigabyte Geforce 670 GTX WF3 with 2GB VRAMPSU:920W MS-TechI had no performance issues. I constantly had solid 60 FPS during the campaign on very high settings!!!Main review textCall of Duty: Ghosts was somewhat fun for me. The graphics as usual are improved with every COD being released. The story was OK. But the sound design didn't quite satisfy me. Some missions in the campaign are extremely fun to play at. Hover mouse over Spoilers to view which and why. Note, I can't recall them all at once.*The jungle, where you are on your own without guidance and must navigate to your squad while ghosting through enemies with a heartbeat sensor. Stealthy*Space warfare and Underwater adventures*Take control of that Predator Pony (Riley) and scout ahead in stealth. Kill a few enemies if you want to :D*Be spiderman on a skyscraper building, invade it, hack the systems and find information about Rorke's whereabouts.Pro's:+ As usual, better graphics with each release of COD. No performance issues, stable 60 FPS.+ Action-Adventure in a different way to play this COD title instead of more shooting. Missions are actually more fun.+ Cut-Scenes! Interaction!Con's:- Sound design mostly doesn't experience real or at least decent. I'm talking about music, gunfire and if I remember correctly, I didn't get to hear footsteps much.- DLC's again? Very nice towards us, trying to suck our money!- COD has the tradition of overpricing their games. This does not step in to effect when it has a discount on.- Region-locked on Steam!General info:Worth playing but not at full price! I had an issue during a mission, where COD Ghosts stopped working. This was due to my videocard driver being out of date (Nvidia v.344 >>> Nvidia v.347) so DO UPDATE your driver upon playing COD Ghosts. Also COD Ghosts decided to crash once after I shot a teammate of mine, who ran past my line of fire... Would bang my teammates again if my team loses on online matches ;)TL;DRNot a spoiler below but behold upon reading it.It's still far better than Minecraft!"

I'm not really sure why they bothered with a single player mode here.  It is too short (3-4 hours with a lot of cutscenes), too predictable (yes, you do have to fend off enemy vehicles from the back of a truck)  and they copied whole scenes from past games...It feels like an afterthought.I really want to like this game.  The multiplayer is fun, but it  was clearly designed for platform gaming.  The PC release is horrendous, plagued by lag, bad optimization and massive stuttering.  Getting better, but for weeks it was completely unplayable...The squads mode is a nice touch if you like playing with bots.  In fact, this is one of the few modes that is currently playable if you don't mind the game crashing every 4 or 5 maps.They relegated clans to 4x4 games.  Not implemented well.  It is so cumbersome to sign people up and there are rarely people playing that mode so you can't find a game.Rarely can you find more than a few hundred playing any particular mode.  The only modes that seem popular are team deathmatch (normal) and Domination (hotpoint)  If you are more of a lone wolf, you will have a hard time finding a game.The less popular modes are often less than 100 players while some of the big team modes have a few thousand.I think the PC version was released far too soon, a lot of players who were excited about the release just stopped playing a week after the release because of the bugs and failed implementation.What I really wanted out of this game was a way I could play with my friends and the closest this comes is you forming a squad with your friends and playing against bots, or you can form a party and join a team match...There are some things I really like about this game, some of the maps are fairly large for COD, the perks and loadout customization are interesting.  Allowing you to purchase multiple squad members to load each one differently is a nice change of pace.  It plays a lot more like Battlefield 3 than COD.I think the game is getting more stable and more playable with each patch.  I would recommend it, it is fun, but given all that went wrong with this releaseI would only have given it 2 out of 5 stars at release.  I will bump it up a star because it is more playable.  I would give another star if they would implement dedicated (ranked) servers."

It is by far my most favourite COD game:Singleplayer has many fun elements to it - Multiplayer is amazing: Some maps like Strikezone are really fun to play in and customisation has reached a new level, with the new ability to also change your squad's looks. It is annoying how you have to 'activate' challenges to complete them (to unlock customisation and stuff). Titles and emblems have now been converted into patches and backgrounds, which is nice. I also love how some guns have integrated attachments - and it is so satisfying to be rid of overpowered machine pistols. There are now Marksman and Sniper Rifles: Marksman rifles are basically semi automatic, while Sniper rifles are the hardcore bolt-action types. This is nice, for people who aren't that good with sniping, while the hardcore snipers can still bust their moves (personally, I prefer the bolt action Sniper Rifles).However, if everyone is put off by the other reviews, then I would advise one to wait for a sale, or at least try to find a way to try it out, but trust me, if you have a deep wallet - like me ;) - then it is a great game.P.S. the playtime is for singleplayer only, I've played multiplayer a lot more ;)"

And no, I'm not an Expert Reviewer. As a writer of this review, I'm ready to see any Comments, Negative, or Positive about this review, anything. I'm ready. so I Try to Review this game the best I Can. If you Want to give a Critics, Please Leave it the Comments :)Idk why, so much hate on this game, I Mean, It's Call of Duty, It's a Great Game btw. I know I Just played this Game not more than 100 Hours, but at Least I've been Try the Single Player, and Multiplayer. The Singleplayer storyline actually Pretty Good, Not That Bad. It's Fun, I Mean it tooks 6 Hours for me to Complete it. And Technically I didn't have any bugs or issues whilst playing. I was able to play on a steady 60 fps on my Laptop which has an i7 CPU and GTX 950M.Multiplayer. Most of the People give it Negative about it, Bugs, issues with connection, or FPS drops, or Anythings. I Never experience any of That, even on my laptop, It's Smooth. Took so Long to Find Match? Well, Most people are already leave the Game, and Not so Much People playing it again. I still Play the Multiplayer with BOTs, Since this Game features a Bot Match that can Give you XP to Rank Up, for ME It's Fun Honestly, Even with BOTs it still Playable on 60 FPS, no Bugs, and Other.Ok, In Conclusion. I did have a lot of fun whilst playing it, however the price of $35 is a Bit Expensive especially for a game which has been out almost three years now.If You a guy just like me, who Like to Just Play the Game, and Play Multiplayer for Fun, I Would Recommend it when The Price is drop about $10 since The Multiplayer almost dead Now. I'm Not saying that This Game is SO Good, and Not saying This Game is BAD, I Mean this Game is Okay and Fun to Play, But get it, If You Really want to Having fun, and Play the Game, and don't Care about Multiplayer. But if You a Gamer who likes to Play the Multiplayer, I Wouldn't suggest you This Game, Since The Community of this Game is Almost dead, No Newer Updates, no More Double XP Event.So I Recommend this Game when On SALE. It's a Fun Game to Play, and It's Call of Duty.That's my Review, If You Have and Opinion, or Critics, Please Leave it in The Comment :)"

Batman - Dark Knight Rises opening scene... tanks falling from planes I’m quite sure that was the A-Team film!Campaign... well worth it, multiplayer... playable on a high end card and system but I wouldn't expect the world from it yet, many hacks already present in online play which does spoil it but if you have a good set of friends who have emptied their pockets on a powerful rig you will enjoy multiplayer just fine.

Though I notice a lot of players with older, mid-range GPUs complain of FPS lag, the graphics is definitely a step up from its DX9 predecessor, Black Ops 2.Gameplay and feel is similar to MW3, but with Squad and Extinction mode. So really you get more for your buck than previous IW games. As an aside, I truly enjoyed the Single Player campaign, it's pretty immersive and much better made than Black Ops 2 SP.Quite upsetting however is the lack of dedicated servers, which enables cheaters to roam freely in any game lobby without swift repurcussions. It will be up to every other player in the lobby to back out and find another lobby, in hopes not to land in another lobby with a cheater, rather than kick the offending player; it's seriously quite aggravating at times.Overall, I'm having loads of fun in this game, and because of its stunning visuals, immersive SP and added Squad/Extinction content, I recommend this game.A brief of my rig which runs the game @ 55-75 FPS:i5 760 @ 4.0ghzNvidia GTX 670Settings you should have to enjoy stunning visuals:Image quality: ExtraTexture, Specular, and Map Resolution: Extra"

However, this game is graphically not made any progress since black ops 2 and in fact may have gotten worse. The game is extremely buggy and glitchy. What I mean by this is fram rates vary from 190 FPS to 17 FPS on my computer. Scoping in with the weapons (particularly sniper rifles) causes my frame rates to cut in half. I can run games of better graphics quality with a higher and ALOT more consistant FPS and its just frustrating. I ended up unintalling before completing the campaign. If the game gets patched to fix bugs and glitches, while still being inferior to previous call of duty's, would make the game at least a 7/10."

,Recommended,209160,8928437,"Posted: 31 January, 2014",all,Greg,"I will base this review on 2 different sections: Single Player and Multi-player.SP: It is absolutely amazing. With the introduction to Riley (THE DOG!!) and many other new aspects it brings a whole new experience when compared to previous Call of Duty titles. Throughout the campaign you experience new, creative objectives such as travelling through space, or even walking down a skyscraper. I have never enjoyed a campaign as much as this one in a long time!M-P: I feel in a way a little disappointed in the way MP is laid out this year. It has a slower pace when compared to previous Call of Duty's and feels in a way like one of it's main rivals, Battlefield 4.. Although the Prestige system is still in place, it is brought to you by buying and playing as individual squad members, meaning that you go through ranks 1-60 on one character then buy the next one and do this so on and fourth until reaching the maximum rank. This is completely different as to what it is usually like and I feel that it hasn't got the same appeal to stay hooked to proceed through the ranks.. Squad points (the currency) are used to buy these squad members and within each individual you need to buy the weapons, perks, attachments etc. Everything bought only sticks to one member so playing within 2 or more members can be difficult as you are always short for points. I think that this system is poor and does not have any advantages over the previous ways of unlocking unlocks."

I have all the settings set to extra, and I have no lag what so ever.  I live in North America and i think I've only been in one game where i suffered from severe lag.  I know a lot of people complain about lag, but I'm just not seeing it.The single player game is just like every other call of duty game.  Don't expect much and you wont be disappointed it.  It's a slight let down after BO2 had alternate endings that was determined by your actions and how well you did on certain levels.  That didn't happen in Ghosts, so thats a dissapointment.  But lets be honest...who really plays call of duty just for the single player?Multiplayer is a lot of the same.  If you've played all the other call of duty games, then you can expect alot of the same.  Sure there are some changes with the kill streaks, but not much has changed with the series over the years.If you have played COD over the years and like the multiplayer game, then you know what to exepect, alot of the same with some minor changes with kill streaks.  A lot of people will complain about lag, but I have to wonder what kind of hardware they are running, because I don't have a system that cutting edge, and it runs great for me on extra settings.  If you have a decent system, dont let all the haters scare you off."

You have to realize that upon release a lot of multiplayer games have bugs and the game's going to get hacked a lot at the beginning. That being said a lot of people simply dislike this game because they aren't good at it. Some people were great at bo2, come to this game with a lot of enthusiasm expecting to pick up where they left off, and it doesn't always happen that way. It's a different game entirely. The maps are a lot bigger and though I hated them at first I like them now because I know them. You have to take the time to learn the maps, how the guns feel, what loadouts and routes to use. You will pick up on where people camp and it will become predictable honestly. I actually haven't seen a wall hack or aimbot in a single lobby the past 2 weeks. Since the more recent patches even I haven't experienced much lag at all and I play on a laptop at a high resolution. They've patched it a few times and will patch it more. The game will become more balanced though honestly it's not that unbalanced as it is. Lets be real, if you aren't hitting that first shot with the msbs you're losing that gun fight, I don't feel it's that op. Once the dlc begins to drop and people see different maps that maybe more suit their taste, as well as the gun dlc that's been confirmed, they will have a different outlook. If you're a cod fan you will like this game! I will say I like the small fast paced action with lanes and♥♥♥♥♥♥that treyarch does and it's great for competitive, but those games were also flawed. You always joined games late and the other team had lode stars, vsats, warthogs, dogs, and god knows what else already in play. There were usually nasty spawn traps set up too, making it even more lame. Every cod has pros and cons remember that when playing this game."

I think it's because the maps are to big for the boots on ground. It feels like this was a ""beta"" for Advanced Warfare. The way the maps are designed feels like there should be Exo Suit movement like in Black Ops III / Infinite Warfare. (Not Advanced Warfare because that was just way to fast.) If there's enough players on at prime time [around 250] you can play the 24/7 Strikezone playlist and have fun.

I was mortified that I might not be able to get the framerates necessary to be competitive. I felt betrayed, but went ahead and bought the game anyway.After some tweaking and major assistance from Nvidia and their driver updates, however, the game is all it is meant to be. Plays well, runs smooth. I have been on top of the leaderboards numerous times, just not consistently. My machine runs an Intel-Core i7-4770 @ 340 mhz. 16 gb ram. 2tb hard drive. Nvidia 1.5 gb GeForce 760 GTX.I do agree with others in the fact that Infinity Ward should have delayed debut until after the bugs were worked out, but I think that was Activision pushing the envelop. I own all of the COD series, play the last five from steam, I have enjoyed them, but will probably be looking in another direction after this one is finished."

And I mean 50 FPS stable, 30 in huge vistas, after just a few minutes of tweaking the many options in the graphics menu and shutting down the physics-heavy fur, you would need some serious power to run that just like anything with nVidia Phsyx or anything similar. The new graphics are very well implemented IMHO, they don't block at any time your ability to see your target with flashy cinema-camera-like features that don't even seem like a soldier's eye at all, all the while being pretty nice to your human, real world eyes.When I bought Black Ops 1 some years ago my processor didn't run it, but I stayed shut and bought a newer one instead of complaining to the devs about their attempt to improve the game. The game even had a graphical glitch that used to crash the game once every while, but I just waited and after a month they fixed that. People just need to get used to tweaking the options in the menus to fit your machine. You can't max everything forever.People say they have no creativity, but I disagree. They are being very creative with what they have and they have to remain true to what their game is, otherwise it's not going to be CoD any longer. They don't have to and shouldn't be trying to be like any other game. There are so many cool games out there, each one has their own approach to FPS. This is CoD's. If you don't like it, good (or bad) for you, go play some other game, nobody is forcing you, dear example of hater, to stay here, even less to complain about it.From what I saw, the whole campaign and a bit of MP, the game is sweet.Epic, unrealistic, Hollywood-like scenes just as every CoD since the fourth. I never before had paused a game because of a para-drop, but for heaven sakes I was not expecting that! It does not try to say at any time it's being realistic, and it's great that way. You embrace the epicness just like you would embrace Halo's sci-fi epicness or any Hollywood action movie's epicness. And yes, it is the same on-the-rails shooter just like most others around. If you don't like this kind of SP gaming, go search something else in the not-so-long list of (mostly great as well) open-worlders.Since i've been bogged into finals and stuff, I couldn't play MP properly, against players. But the AI MP I tried was great. The bots are smart, much better than the CSS stuff I've got used to. I was actually surprised when one of them jumped to dodge my rounds. All other MP features felt like improvements over the last few games, such as cool maps that embrace the best of CoD's frantic CQB combat, an easily accessible scoreboard that doesn't crash my keyboard for pressing too many buttons, cool new balance/usefulness-focused weapons (rather than a huge rooster of rifles of which only 2 are good due to little care for balancing), interesting point reward system, and, for me, the list goes on and on.People that compare this game to BF4 are crazy IMO. They are different games with different ideas and very different graphical engines. You can't just create an BF4 engine in the span of a year to add to your game. They needed at least 3 years of work together with several studious to make the first frostbite in 2008, more five years of improvements and investment got them their engine's third iteration, which is great. Yet, their engine is carefully tailored not to require any graphical options that might be too heavy on any machine, they save on textures and occlusion and exaggerate the lightning to mask  that. In a certain way, Ghosts' engine is technically heavier than BF4's. Just look at the requirements: CoD's minimal asks for double (1024 Mb)the VRAM and 6 Gbs of RAM next to BF4's 512 Mb VRAM-4Gb Ram minimum. People often don't understand that kind of thing and start jumping to conclusions.Every game comes out with a few bugs. If the guys from other companies had the idea of making open-betas, great. But if there where none, for whichever reasons, don't expect a perfect game right off the bat.From what I could see, this game is a logical improvement over the last. When you go to the cinema to see LOTR 2 some years after you saw the first, you have to expect what's obvious: the continuation of what they promised you with some Visual FX improvements. The game delivers much more than a disguised launcher update and a map pack, it's a whole new piece of juicy shoot-em-up impressiveness. I don't know what all those hater-commenters where expecting when they bought the game, but it delivered just what I've got used to expect from a CoD, and it was GREAT!"

There is so much new to examine while you still have the gameplay COD is known for. I like the features of “Squads” and find the multiplayer to work rather well even without dedicated servers. I would rather see dedicated servers to be honest, they should never had been moved to an after thought for PC players. Biggest mistake the franchise chose to do. Anyways.. The soldier build up is all new and works rather well. You now have a squad worth of soldiers that can also be leveled up and designed as you wish. Very interesting and look forward to more. Graphics are stunning when set to “Extra” and all seems to run pretty smooth for “me”. I didn’t buy the expansion pack “yet”.. but most likely will.I played Battlefield 4 for 5 days straight before this release. I have yet to load Battlefield since. People keep comparing the two titles although they do not play the same at all. Let us be honest here, they are both same old same old but refined for the better(we hope) each year. There are many ways to play these titles with known winning abilities in execution. I like ground pounding and COD offers that in spades. Battlefield is more of a Vehicle play although to me a bit arcadish in execution BF4 “defuse mode” is interesting and a take on Search and Destroy, my favorite type of play in these games. Ghost still has S&D buried inside, however they are toting a new twist with Search and Rescue which allows the possibility of revival from a team mate. I never warmed to Blackops or Blackops 2 nor would I suggest them to others. This title though? Single player and Multiplayer get my nod.. nicely done with no patches yet.. can only get better.Remember the minimum requirements folks.. you will need 6 gig of Memory (update: now 4) to get this running on the PC.. I would also suggest a 660 or better graphics card.. don’t hate the game for this.. The bugs for “some” seem to do with graphics and the minimum ram requirement. I have neither or any bug that can relate to my system. The “only” bug I have seen is no mouse control left or right to change players you are spectating when dead in Search and Rescue games. I am sure they will fix that in a patch and does not really effect gameplay. I don’t really have an Uber system either. I5 2500k, 16 gig ram, GTX670 card and RAID HD to SSD. I call it a basic medium system and specs.Plenty of MP maps right at release and many ways to play. I have no choice but to like this game for what it is.. a winner. [GS] 8/10"

Otherwise fairly standard Call of Duty experience with no noticeable update to the graphics or gameplay though it doesn't really need it. The level design is interesting with more verticality than has been utilised in the past. As with the previous titles this installment has obviously been developed for Xbox and then ported over to PC, poorly at that.

They are getting fixed, also, the next gen was right on the gaming community's neck, and the game was made for consoles rather than PC.The story:The Campaign is Very good, the cinematics just BEATIFUL, and sometimes the audio lags for me (I don't know what happens with others) the game runs at a smooth 60 fps, the story telling is excellent. The space mission is AMAZING, very detailed, and very fun. The twist at the ending comes like a suprise, and I was not disappointed.The Rorke files put little pieces to the campaign, so you might wanna collect them.The multiplayer/Extinction/Squads:The multiplayer is changed in a good way. You can select the head, the gender, the body and literally EVERYTHING. Squad points is a great feature, and the weapons are great.Extinction is a 4 player co-op mode, and it's same as Treyarch zombies, but better. Four classes, the weapon specialist, the tank, the engineer, and the medic. They are all important for survival. 6000 is the maximum cash you get, and there are challenges for each hive that can be completed and also failed (except the barrier hives). It's a fun gamemode. Squads is  very good. You can also level up there, you can play Safeguard and etc.This game deserves a 9/10.Pros:-A very good storyline-Great storytellling-Descructible enviroment-Customizeble characters-Exctinction-Squads-Rorke files-Beatiful CutscenesCons:-Bad Graphics on Multiplayer-Crashes (Rarely happens for me)"

FYI I am a COD fan and as such perhaps too forgiving of what some people hate about the series.So, if you hate COD Ghosts is not going to win you over. However, having said that I still think its a very solid entry into the series. It has its up and downs, but I would give a very solid 8.5/10.It has an innovative story of a potential future.  It is interesting to play the SP. The characters are still generic or atleast over-used cliche. And the plot device of the single ueber-villian who won't die is really starting to get on my nerves. They come up with a super Tom Clancy-esqe story and then they have to ram in mr-sobstory, evil guy who seems to out-whit you at every turn. I hated that in previous games, here too.MP is ok this time around. I like how at launch the assault rifles seem to trump smgs. So its pretty much curtains for the run-and-gun players. You have to move slowly and watch your angles. CQ maps are still ruled by the smg though. Overall, I prefered Black Ops 2's MP to ghosts. It just felt meatier.Now, the best part IMO. The extinction mode. This time around, no zombies, just aliens. Its a ton of fun to play, almost like its own game. Plenty of people playing, not like zombies which was too hard and lost 90% of players.Final verdict. All pc players should play it. In the end, if you Ignore a juggernaut like COD just out of spite, you are the only one loosing out. IMHO. there is no monthly fee (yet) like on an mmorpg so its super value for your buck."

(8/10)Singleplayer is playable with a somewhat strange storyline which didn't get me bored. (9/10)Sure copying scenes is really unprofessional but let's hope they hear our comments and make the game better for the PC.Overall (8/10), due to lack of optimization for pc."

Also extremely balanced gameplay, and great ideas. Optimizations definitely need to keep coming because its not very stable (as opposed to being a smooth trouble free game). The lack of both an effective anti-cheat system and dedicated servers is frustrating.  The population is small because of this. Youll spend most of your time in lobbies waiting for people to join. The new Search and Rescue gametype is awesome and I'll never go back to regular hardcore Search and Destroy, which says alot because thats all I've played since COD4.Kudos for the good game, and a Go ♥♥♥♥ Yourself for not making it as playable and cheat free as it should be. -kRoOkEd"

Yes, you may have to turn the settings down, but the graphics are slightly on the s**t side anyway and you really dont notice as this game is so fast paced. That is only for the multiplayer however. On the Campaign, it runs smoothly at 60+ FPS on my Nvidia GTX 760 and AMD Quad Core CPU with the settings turned up to max. Im thoroughly enjoying the Multiplayer with my Xbox 360 controller as the Gamepad is integrated seamlessly. Extinction seems like a bit of a gimmick, but after a couple of rounds, I even found that to be quite ejoyable.

SURPRISED FACE""One of the most disappointing Call of Duty games to date. Frequent crashes, poor framerate issues in a graphically unimpressive game, and weird mouse smoothing issues are just a few problems I've encountered within a few minutes of gameplay. Aside from the (extremely) poor optimization for PC, the storyline is dull and the voice acting will often make you cringe at how cheesy it is. Overall the campaign feels rushed, and absolutely nothing about it feels original or new. If you've played Battlefield 3 or 4's singleplayer, you might catch yourself noticing that most of the missions feel like dumbed down versions of that games' campaign missions.Multiplayer isn't necessarily bad as it is literally nothing new from previous entries. Once again they reorganized the class and leveling system, but the gameplay hasn't changed at all. The maps aren't very good, and most games will consist of you getting shot in the back from someone who just spawned behind you. That's for Team Deathmatch. I would comment on other gametypes, but there never seems to very many people on any other playlist. Multiplayer basically feels like MW3 with better graphics and ""different"" weapons.Don't get me wrong, I'm not a stereotypical anti-CoD pc gamer. I was actually really looking forward to ghosts as I was hoping that IW would've learned from their mistakes with MW3 and improve upon their system. Sadly, since West and Zampella got fired it seems Infinity Ward is just a shell of what it used to be, and the IW-made CoD games, which used to be the best ones, are now turning out to be worse than Treyarch's entries.Unless you are a die-hard CoD fan who isn't interested at all in the story mode or any noticeable changes in gameplay, you'd be better off spending your money on Battlefield 4, a game that actually improved and innovated on its previous entry. Or at least wait for IW to come out with a patch that fixes the frequent crashes and poor graphics optimization. Be careful, though, since IW's focus is on consoles you might be waiting for a very long time."

,Recommended,209160,8403943,"Posted: 29 December, 2013",all,Scarmax,"I don't know why this game got such a low user score on Metacritic because I really enjoyed it.  Sure, it's classic CoD and the gameplay feels much the same as previous CoD games, but that doesn't mean it isn't a fun experience.  Yes, it's mostly linear, but it wasn't advertised as anything else, so it's not like I didn't know that was coming.  My only issue is that it sucks up 30GB of HDD space!There are complaints about the graphics, but that must be the console people because it looksgorgeouson my PC, and I play pretty much every new shooter or action game that comes out.  CoD: Ghosts easily ranks up there with any other current or next-gen graphics engine, with realistic shaders and lighting, and there's an underwater sequence that is nothing short of breathtaking.  There are complaints about stuttering framerates, but I didn't seeanyof that, so I really don't know where that's coming from, even with nearly all details cranked to maximum at 1920x1080.  There are a few options that I don't have set to max because they don't really make much difference that you can see.  I also never experienced any lockups or crashes, period.  The game runs flawlessly every time.  No drops in framerate at any time either, so again... no idea what people are talking about.  I guess there are still quite a few people out there that just don't know how to set up a gaming PC?  (Not that it's difficult, of course.)I can't rate the multiplayer because I didn't try it, simply because online shooters like this have become boring the point of being a crime, so I already know what to expect, not to mention that they are flooded with cheaters and hackers only days after release, so there's really no point.  So if the MP component is unbalanced, or has lame maps... okay, fine, whatever.  Let the multiplayer ""child minds"" rub thier va-jay-jays with glee as they ""own"" people online with headshots, and complain about whatever they want, but I don't give a crap.  It's also really sad when someone gives a game a poor review based entirely off the multiplayer and never even tried the single-player campaign.I liked the single-player part, and if you want a good single-player shooter experience, CoD: Ghosts is a fine addition to the franchise."

Deep emotional connection with the characters including Riley the K-9 dog. Equally captivating storyline as the Call of Duty Black Ops franchise was. Great work. However one really annoying issue that seems to be a major bug or systematic error in the game, is the sniper rifle scope FPS drop. When I look (aim) with the sniper rifle scope at any given circumstance the FPS (and therefore my ability to accurately aim) goes from my solid 60FPS down by avg. 15-20 to somewhere around 45 FPS. The stutter that this causes, especially compared to when I do not look down on the scope, makes it impossible to perform well as a sharpshooter. My squad and I lost multiple battle rounds in multiplayer because I was unable to support them as a sniper. Any updates or bug fix that will help this very troubling issue? It is obviously not my computer hardware (as you will see my specs at the end of this note), I also saw other users complaining about it. Please save the game for poor PC owners and do not do the same mistake as Ubisoft or other companies are doing by abandoning the PC game market with badly optimized PC versions.

Really, I would comfortably say I'm well above average in knowing how to configure a computer to run a video game. That being said, I know when something is poorly optimized. This game is not optimized for AMD hardware. If you have a higher-end intel chip, and a really decent graphics card, then you should be fine. This is dissapointing, as the game isn't all that impressive graphically, so it goes to show that the dev's simply aren't interested in providing a better experience across all platforms. AMD does everything I want it to at a fraction of the price, and the only time performance is poor, is in games where dev's won't take the time to better optimize their games for a wider range of hardware.So, my experience will be vastly different than someone who can play the game without issues.

The ""horde"" mode they used to compete with Nazi Zombies is boring and doesnt appeal to me and I am sure nobody else finds it interesting.The game runs smooth on my AMD build have had no crashes or loss of frames so I'd say for me the game is optimized to my approval.However, the multiplayer is absolute trash. The number one reason why it is trash is because the Multiplayer is region locked. I could find a match faster and with more people in it while playing Modern Warfare 2 then I could with Call of Duty: Ghost. Let me just remind you that Modern Warfare 2 is a few years old.Also this game has too much needless DLC. Marijuana skins, a dog skin and paying 5 ♥♥♥♥ing dollars to be an astronaught in multiplayer? This almost makes Oblivion's Armored Horse DLC look worth it.In Summary.....- Fix multiplayer matchmaking- Stop with all of the needless DLC- Make the Horde mode appealingDo those three things and I will give a thumbs up."

Hands down. The detail and love on every conceivable level that had been poured into the game from a relatively small, unknown studio was immense, all of it with the goal of making the MoH series look bad. It worked. Maybe a little too well.From the original CoD to where we are now, the games have been gradually getting worse. There have been up points, WaW and MW2 had their moments, but aside from that it's been pretty crap. The CoD series has become a series of games to be aimed at people who don't play games. It is now a franchise for bros.Too many ideas people saying 'lets do this!' 'what a good idea!' have killed CoD. Too much money has been poured into the franchise for CoD to be about being a decent game - nowadays you're just paying for the label - seriously - and Ghosts is ♥♥♥♥ing awful.-Graphics/lighting/models - Nothing special, in fact some times quite disappointing. Battefield 3 is prettier...and older, think about that.-Gameplay - Nothing special. It's CoD, so pretty unimaginative. A couple of new features like controlling a dog. Huzzah...-Sounds/Soundtrack/Voiceacting - Nothing special, save the voice acting. They managed to get genuine actors for a lot of the voices, including that awesome Colonel bloke from Avatar. Mint.-Characters - Riley the Dog is by far the best. Everyone else is forgetable and terrible.-Campaign/plot  - It's like a bad Michael Bay movie. Sorry, I mean, it's like a Michael Bay movie. Lot's of explosions, people shouting ""OHMIGAWD!"" ""RANGEEERS!"" ""SHIIIIII-!"" ""MARIIIINES!"". Plot wise, CoD was kind of losing the plot around MW2, going a little nuts with BO2, but in Ghosts they've gone completely off the reservation. It's laughably bad. All of it. And then you stop laughing. Because it's bad.-Multiplayer - The new custom soldier features are quite cool and the money system is one I've always liked. Sadly, like all CoD games on PC the multiplayer is easily and frequently hacked by people who have just bought CoD to♥♥♥♥♥♥people off. The Infection mode? Nazi Zombies without the Nazis or zombies and so ♥♥♥♥ing ridiculous it's barely believable - then you remember that Ghosts was conceived by a four year old and all makes sense. Oh yeah, it's CoD, so every lobby will be filled with prepubescent tw@s.All in all, Ghosts is decidedly average; nothing sepearting it from anything else except the CoD badge. Compare it to big name games that came out around the same time and it scores below average. Take that into consideration and then think about all the hype, all the promotions, all the money and all the people who worked on this game and their years of experience to give you the final product. Shameful.Stood next to it's ancestors like CoD 1 and CoD 2, Ghosts is appalling - stood next to it's primary competitors like Battlefield (Both BF3 and BF4 with their fair share of problems), it is incomprehensibly bad for all the resources that it had while in development.And then there was the initial 6GB RAM requirement for PC users...when the game uses 2GB at a push. Just bone idleness during the port process? Possible, or trying to mislead PC gamers into thinking that CoD Ghosts was pushing the envelope? Let's hope it's the former. But judging by the finished product I'm not sure the devs would be stupid enough to say that Ghosts pushes any envelopes. Not even a nudge - the envelopes remain stationary. Hah. Stationary.And the to have the audacity - the bare faced cheekery to (still!) charge full price for this dry turd on a plate? Save your money. If you want to play a good CoD game, don't buy anything after the first Black Ops, they were really phoning it in by that time.CoD is well past it's peak and needs a fall from grace. After that they might make a decent game again - like MoH managed to...until they messed it up again..."

Character development is hit and miss and dialogue ranges from average to down right awful. The ending also leaves a lot to be desired. I really wish either Treyarch or IW would make a co-op campaign for these games as I think that might add some fun. Either way SP COD is really showing it's age both graphically and mechanically.

Be warned Steam community, Ghosts is poorly optimized, looks exactly the same as MW3, is stripped of all its fun add-ons like: Zombies, Horde-Mode, or even a half-a$$ campaigne! Multiplayer is buggy, unreliable, and laggy to all hell! Stay away from Ghosts like its the ♥♥♥♥ing plague! Get Black Ops 2 if you want a functional COD game. Simply the worst COD ever made, I am foolish for throwing away 60$ on such a poor title. Good-bye COD, you deserve to be shut down!Concept: A very convoluted storyline with no characters you ever care about, makes the campaigne dull. Multiplayer is a major downgrade from previous COD games and is unacceptable. 40/100Graphics: Everything looks very grey and dull, nothing looks like it has any life, very low detail in just about everything and low resolution textures are at an all time bad.

The framerate is all over the place, the graphics are simply uprezed textures from the console version with nearly no support for things like DX11. The campaign is boring, predictable, and the only CoD single-player that was so uninteresting I didn't even finish it. The multiplayer from what I was able to play was the same old song and dance as usual. The problem is, I was having some fun with it until the game decided to constantly crash from an extremely obnoxious memory leak crashing issue. I have an fx 8350 and 2 gtx 770s in sli, and this game lags and crashes more than extremely demanding next gen titles like BF4, Crysis 3, and the Witcher 2. It is horribly optimized and won't even launch unless the person playing has at least 6gb of RAM, which means anyone with an older, midrange, or laptop PC won't even be able to play the game. And they have the gall to not only relase DLC but buy out Nvidia to sponsor this peice of crap. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. As a CoD fan for many years I can tell you that your money will be much better spent of Black Ops II, which is a great port and has the best campaign the series has seen in years. It is a much better game and you can run it on anything. CoD: Ghosts is one of the worst FPS games I've played and as a PC port it is a disaster. Stay away and spend your money elsewhere."

I bought into the pre-release hype and purchased copies for myself and a buddy. The day of the release, the reviews looked amazing; Ghosts had scored an aggregate of ~90%. From the minute I first launched the game (PC platform) the gameplay was terrible - the interface screens all stuttered (most online user reviews will point this out), even eight months later no smoothness is in sight. The spawns are designed to keep your deaths as high as possible. The guns are breathtakingly weak, put a silencer on them and you have cool looking backscratchers. Motion in this game is anything but smooth. The one thing that really bothers me is how the game reacts rigidly when you are turning corners, passing through doorways - you will run into and be blocked by these things, along with pebbles, boxes and anything that occupies space in the gameworld. This makes the game feel like a product from 2004 and earlier. How the game scored such rave reviews on day 1 is a mystery; luckily the true game reviews are in place now. Even 68% is an overestimmation. Poorly designed game - poor game engine for 2014 - poor support (they still haven't fixed most of these things for PC) - false advertisement. This was a robbery of loyal CoD fans. Do not waste your time and money with Ghosts. I have a bad feeling for the next game as well."

After only recording 8/9 hours on Black Ops 2 I have fallen in love with Ghosts and COD multiplayer again. However it is not without its criticisms - mainly the poor optimisation; the games runs heavy and suffers FPS issues causing me for the first time to drop down to 720 resolution. Not even Crysis 3 made me do that!However this is my sole criticism and if I focus on gameplay I would go as far as to say this is the best COD (certainly for multiplayer) since MW2. The class building system has been substantially revamped and to a COD veteran, like myself, it was actually a bit confusing to start with but once I understood it I appreciated the greater flexibility on offer. Class building is much less limited and you can really build a class to your strengths whether that be a speed running hip firing class or a full on stealthy slow class.The maps are a bit inconsistent. Some maps are a bit large and overly complicated with the action being focussed in only a small section of the map but some maps are fantastically layered providing interesting horizontal and vertical sight lines. Not to mention destroyable scenery (e.g. on Octane blowing holes you can aim through on the roof of one building) and interactive objects. All in all the ratio of good maps to bad maps is weighted towards more good maps - another plus!Extinction too is a nice addition. Its something fresh (sort of BO Zombie style) for the COD franchise and is actually really done well. Makes for a fun break from standard multiplayer.Overall if you can deal with playing at lower settings and care more about gameplay then Ghosts:Multiplayer is definitely the best COD for a long time and is worth the time and money."

Now if you try to get into a game with more than 2 people squaded up, good luck.  Usually two of us have to go into a game and third person will have to join after and hope he gets on our team which most of the time does not happen.  I do like the bigger maps and the graphics look better.  New game modes are really nice too but i never get to play them because not enough people play them.  If we had true dedicated servers with a server browser like COD 4 it would make joining games so much easier.  There would be servers dedicated for the less popular game modes that you can always join and actually play.  This would also bring down the ridiculous amount of cheaters in this game.  I never seen a game with more cheaters that go unpunished and actually brag about it in the game.  If you NEED to play a COD game while your waiting for Treyarchs usual better game (BO 2 has more people playing than Ghosts) then go ahead and get this game.

Additionally, the game hasen't even been out too long now and almost always half of the game types, with the exception of the hated TDM, are always empty. How on earth am I supposed to enjoy a game that I paid over $60.00 for if I can never play the game type I enjoy (S&D). There are way too many options to choose from which dilutes the gameplay. This game sucks....don't waste your money.Here's an idea for the next release, try re-inventing the game from scratch. As a pc gamer I would love to see a modern warfare game that plays like old school CODUO (and yes there is a very loyal fan base that keeps that one alive for more than 10 years for a reason...jeeps, tanks, etc.). Plain and simple and where it actually took talent to win. Oh but wait...that would involve more effort than just slapping a new skin on dated material. Unfortunetly, we all know that any real talent in producing this game has long left the franchise. It's sad.You have truely lost my business at this point. I'm going to BF4!"

Zombies mode has now changed to Extinction mode (zombies are now aliens), the way to play this mode is totally renewed, you will not die so easily and you will be able to improve your character on the go like in a RPG. Customization has been improved too, allowing to choose clothes, face, hat, cammo... you can even select a wolf skin to your dog companion (DLC purchase) As many other games, there will be DLCs that are not included in the game and you have to pay for them. These include new maps, weapons, skins, chapters for extinction mode and some more stuff yet to know. As you may guess, these packages are optional and add new features to the game just in case that you agree to pay.Amazing game, unlimited hours of multiplayer, brand new extinction mode and customization options, clan wars accesible to all players wether you are a pro player or not, companion app available for tablets and smartphones.

,Recommended,209160,7965222,"Posted: 7 December, 2013",all,LIKEUCARE,"Call of Duty: Ghosts isn't a reinvention of the franchise. Ghosts is a new CoD franchise. It is a copy paste of previous Call of Duty games and the franchise fatigue could be felt throughout the whole game. Whether you are a fan or not of the CoD franchise, you can always expect a working game, that can offer you the same kind of fun you had on earlier games. In my opinion, even if the game didn't innovate much, the campaign kept me interested with its varied missions till the end. It might not be the best CoD game but I wouldn't call it the worst.PROS+Engaging campaign with fun but improbable story (variety in missions, space, underwater, etc; compared to Battlefield 4).+Serviceable game (""Works out of the box"", unlike BF4 that's just way too buggy to play both Campaign and especially Online).+Riley, the German Sheperd dog, is actually fun to control once given the control. But, that rarely happen.+Decent voice acting (Stephen Lang!).CONS:-Dated engine (Might be heavily modified and a proven engine, but that Quake 3 engine is way too old in today's gaming)-Weapons sounds are bad.-No volume options (Can't tone down the music and tone up the voice sound, i.e.).-""Railroad missions"", Extremely linear, no place for exploration, Obey game scripts or die and repeat until you do.-Bland multiplayer. Doesn't innovate much on that aspect. Same Call of Duty vibe from past CoD games.-No notable innovation in this game. I felt the CoD fatigue while playing Ghosts but you do know what you're expecting though.-Running speed is so damn slow, same with reload; unlike BF4 that do have these fast enough.OVERALL:I actually liked the campaign mode, albeit being extremely linear and like the Modern Warfare series, very improbable. The story mode is long enough for a war game and also, the missions are quite different from each others. Compared to Battlefield 4, Call of Duty Ghosts is way better, varied and actually engaging. But the multiplayer has little to offer on Ghosts.RECOMMEND:As a new franchise, I'd recommend for the campaign mode, if you do seek a fun war game, with interesting ""improbable"" story. But I wouldn't recommend this game for the multiplayer if you already have a previous Call of Duty game since this one have little new to offer you. Better yet, stick with Battlefield 3 for multiplayer gameplay... and BF4 once it gets fixed down the road.Best recommendation: Get this game on a deal. 60$ for the campaign is expensive and I should have waited for Steam holiday sales to get this game.RATING:7.0 / 10"

76561198023431074,Recommended,209160,7986683,"Posted: 9 December, 2013",all,MARVELMAZ,"This review is based on my 10 hour run of the single player campaign; I will not be looking into the multiplayer aspect.Gameplay: Call of Duty: Ghosts, gameplay wise is a lot like past Call of Duty games that are post Modern Warfare. The game has smooth controls and adds a few extra gameplay elements for us to use during the campaign, in other words, unlike what the mass might say, Call of Duty: Ghosts is actually trying new things compared to past Call of Duty titles.One of the new gameplay elemets include being able to see the game from the perspective of an army K9; I believed that the addition of the gameplay element was original for the series and added some freshness. Besides controlling the army K9 at some levels of the game, we also get to have gun fights in Space at some points of the game. The zero gravity gun play element felt fun and responsive.If anything, I would have liked it if these new elements that have been implemented in the game could have been used more. Unfortunately we do not spend a satisfying amount of time exploring new gameplay ideas, but besides the lack of length, the gameplay is solid, responsive, dynamic and most importantly, fun.Graphics: Unfortuantely my hardware does not allow me to play using all the settings at their highest, so I have been playing with no Vsync and with Low ambient occlusion, the rest of the settings are all cranked up to their highest and I can honestly say that Call of Duty has finally decided to take a step forward in visuals.The character models are detailed with great textures, there are great looking particle effects, some fancy reflection and beam effects have been added to the game that were not present in the series before. Now, is this the best looking game I have seen? No, but it is definitely an improvement for the Call of Duty franchise. The game looks quite beautiful at times when the greatly detailed models move around with their smooth animation; it certainly makes the game look a lot more dynamic. Also the realistic Fur tech for Nvidia users will provide great detail when they look at their K9 companion, which makes me believe that the use of that tech might bring about a lot more realism to other character models as well in the future.Story: The plot of Call of Duty: Ghosts is not the most original one, it is nothing we might have not seen before one way or another. Yet even though the plot is not original, it is executed very well. From start to end you almost never feel disconnected from experience and the use of short events for story telling makes the experience a lot more immersive. While on an infiltration mission, or conflict with the enemy, the game always treats you as an important part of what is going on. While the game interacts with us, the story telling becomes personal as we are basically living the moment inside the game, and progress with the story telling as we follow the plot. Basically, even though the plot may not be too creative, it is well executed and a joy to part take in with acknowledgement from the characters around us.Criticism: There aren't a lot of bashing that I am planning to do as the game most certainly gave me a great experience, but there are always rough edges in any game that needs to be looked at.My first criticism would be the length of gameplay, it is too short and the single player campaign ends under 10 hours. For such an expensive game I would have at least expected the developer to go the extra mile and give the player more to enjoy so that the game might have been more satisfying. As an old school gamer I usually do not go for games under 12 hours when it comes to first person shooters, unless of course, as I have pruchased this game, the game is at a discount. So note that the game might be rather short for people who like lengthy experiences.My second cricism is that some parts of the game feel very familiar. In fact so familiar that I could swear that I have seen those parts either in other games, or in past Call of Duty games. Either way, I did not like the fact that some parts felt like copy and paste work, which made those particular parts of the game feel cheap for me.Verdict: The criticism aside, this is a very good game with smooth gameplay, interactive story telling and nice visuals that deserve to be bought at a price of 60$ or under. I recommend this to people who like action games that can immerse them in a very short period of time and will give them a single player campaign experience of 8-9 hours."

Leave the Call of Duty games scheduled for PC to Treyarch, who knows how to please the PC community and knows what they require in order to play properly.

,Recommended,209160,18118248,"Posted: 20 September, 2015",all,Knoxville,"This review focuses primarily on the singleplayer aspects of Ghosts; I realize many enjoy the multiplayer aspect, and it is indeed good but I'm much too old to be berated by 12 year olds so I tend to avoid the multiplayer, likewise it's something that seems to get largely overlooked in the reviews. ;-DThe campaign is the usual CoD fodder: a Michael Bay movie with more explosions but dialogue that usually doesn't make you cringe. Essentially it follows the tried and true angry arch nemesis from the past route that every CoD game since Modern Warfare has done. While it certainly isn't horrible, it isn't spectacular either; unfortunately the first mission fills you with hope that everything is going to be a bit different from previous campaigns, perhaps you will be fighting predominantly locally as a guerilla fighter and being challenged with weaponry that doesn't completely trump your opposition, particularly since they portray a fascinating scenario in which the front lines have stagnated much like world war 1 with a no-mans land between the sides... no such luck. You go from guarding the wall with your awesome dog and Superman (your brother) to becoming a scuba diving, globe trotting, ninja in the blink of an eye with a bunch of indistinguishable and forgettable spec ops.Overall, every level is decent in and of itself and the setpieces are spectacular, albeit sometimes the plans are more absurd than an A-Team episode (i.e. instead of destroying the pylons of an oil rig while you are already scuba diving below it, sabotaging said oil rig to explode while you're on it). Unfortunately just as soon as you begin to understand a mechanic it's gone forever. Riley your lovable and homicidal dog is only in the first few missions so just as soon as you get the gist of using him to attack he's no longer available. Similarly gadgets like thermal vision, tear gas, or strobe lights that blind and disorient the enemy are only utilized for a minute at most in the campaign leaving you thinking ""that was fun, can't wait to try that again"" only to eventually realize you won't ever get to try that mechanic again unless you reload that level.In summary, the single player of Ghosts is overall enjoyable but it would have been a considerably stronger gameplay experience if they had focused more on a few mechanics such as fighting alongside Riley and done less globe trotting, basing the majority of the story in Southern California instead. Buy it on sale when it's about the price of going to a movie and you'll likely enjoy the singleplayer. Of course after the campaign you can always jump into the multiplayer and be berated by 12 year olds extending the value of the title considerably if that's your thing."

The single player campaign is every bit as intense as other Call of Dutys and has elements from the classic World War 2 titles like Tank battles and modern titles like Helicopter battles and even Under Water and Space battles.  It's a fun campaign.Are there technical issues?  Yes but the game is still playable and fun.  I recommend it for fans of the series but wait for a sale.  Activision charges too much for older Call of Dutys.

Além dos terríveis LAG’S e sem saber que cada jogador PC tem suas configurações um tanto limitadas a cada lançamento do CoD (qual vai ser o próximo mesmo?) a cada ano o jogador que acompanha a série tem que montar ou adquiri um PC novo ou sonha com um desses da NASA! faça-me um favor. O jogo perdeu a sua essência CoD Ghost, decepção terrível. E quem teve a infeliz ideia de colocar esse cão que sobrevive mais que o player no jogo?. Adoro os cães mais no seu abitar natural não no jogo. Nesse caso viva a “DICE” com Battlefield 3, 4 e o que vem por ai pois só lança o jogo quando finalmente está completo e polido.

I have been trying to find the good in this game but, it comes up completely short of the great gaming experience promised. The graphics are not what I expected, especially considering all the hype from the developers. The gameplay, well it doesn’t exist. The maps are far to large for the amount of players and spawn points are rediculous. The frame rates drop at the worst times and the mouse input feels like I have tourette’s. This probably part due to the fact, there are no dedicated servers and we are on some weird console port.Considering that this is one of the biggest game franchises out there, it seems that the testing of this game in different environments didn’t happen or that they just could have care less of the gamer’s experience. I will say it is slightly better now than at release but, I still could not suggest this game as a purchase until they address some major concerns."

People if you buy this game, you either are a blind fanboy, or for some reason didn't know what they were in for. This game is the epitome of the cancer of the industry, a bloated lump filled with nothing but hatred and loating for those that play it. This game adds nothing new at all, all the modes and way the games have been havent changed at all. The whole ""THIS IS NEXT GEN, BUY THIS BECAUSE NEXT GEN"" is nothing at all. This game runs horridly, it dosent matter if it's maxed out, or on the lowest settings. It will crash, the textures will get stretched to the point where they take the whole screen up rendering the game unplayble, and the loading screens between missions will stutter and their audio will cut with it.The single player campaign is nothing speacial at all. The same thing as always, but much shorter. This is also playing on veteran, which is unreal the way they do it. A good example is the last mission. Your on a train, it's swaying and going up and down since it's on a track that's above it and just hanging. You can't aim at all, the enemies though? they must have been hitting some slo mo for dredd, because they never miss no matter how much the train is shaking. Speaking of the last mission, it ends on a cliff hanger, that's after they play some credits the main baddy kicks both of you in the face and drags you away. We're going to get a sequel to this pile, and it's going to be just as bad.Pass on this bloat ware and save the harddrive space. The mulitiplayer is same with no changes except the scoreboard, which I actually like. The only resaon to get this is extinction mode, and even then you would be better to get this on one of the consoles seeing as this is going to be dead within a few months."

They have moved from 12 man teams to 6 man teams which I believe is them attempting to go towards an esport route rather than competing against bf4.   Understanding the loadout system took a while to learn as well as it is not user friendly, the grenades and tatical items will also take some getting used to as they do not conform to realism i.e. motion detector which you start with does not show them on your mini map but instead will explode like a mine and then allow you to see them through walls for a brief period of time.  Killstreaks have also changed in this game some for the better and some for the worse but this will be more of a personal opinion.  Game requirements have recently been lowered so that is a major improvement.  Maps while it was said they were larger in reality they are still the size best suited for run and gun playstyle than sniper nests and the enviroment is more suited for constant movement rather than ""camping"" an area or section of the map.  However on the other hand the maps have several layers to them 2-3 most of the time so they have more depth and passageways to areas so creating a choke point is much more difficult.  In this respect the maps could be considered larger.Overall this game feels like more of an updated version of counter-strike where you have a small team to complete your objective.  The responsiveness of the game is still very good but suffers from the lack of a server it still uses the p2p system."

Well bought this in the Steam Sale. Well, i'm really glad i bought this game. Check your pc can run it. (i only say that because it was in the top10 of graphics intensive pc games in a list i saw). The graphics are brilliant. i'm enjoying the Single Player storyline and is very forgiving on low difficulty so if you're rusty or just don't play many fps and want to give one a shot i'd definitely recommend this. Many different side elements have you in space floating and jetpacking around shooting enemies, repelling down buildings, controlling your attack dog to stealthily attack enemies, flying helicopter gunships to take out targets, using long range sniper rifle, using a silenced pistol with movement locator to take out enemies, aswell as normal assault rifle stuff in different stages of the sp storyline. still playing through the sp storyline so probably a lot more. All i can say is it's fun and coupled with the forgiving aspect, i'd definitely give it 10/10. If you're an experienced fpser i'd probably suggest you read another review for a more relevant opinion on the higher difficulty settings. I normally prefer multiplayer aspect of games (theres something sterile to me playing against bots but being a story its different) and have only tried the extinction mode mp with bots and for a very short time so cant really comment on the mp apart from saying its frenetic-i'll get round to playing mp with other players when ive finished sp storyline(campaign) i expect.. if i'd known the game was like this i'd have bought it full price earlier. there's lots of dlc mp i believe but not bought any yet. only had this game a relatively short period but loving it. jfi i'm using a 360 controller on my pc. it's a great, fun game."

Sin embargo, hay algunos elementos que han sido ""refinados"". En multiplayer, los killstreaks no son tan predominantes ni le dan tanto la ventaja al equipo ganador, haciendolo más balanceado. Los mapas son más grandes y predomina el elemento sorpresa y saber camuflarse. La campaña es corta y la historia no es muy inspirada, pero da inicio a lo que parece ser una nueva saga y te introduce de manera adecuada al multiplayer. Continúa siendo menos táctico que Battlefield, pero eso no es necesariamente un punto en contra pues no es lo que el juego busca.No es una joya, pero entretenido."

I see so many bad reviews on this game, and so many of them say things like ""same old game re-hashed"".Well, just how many things can you do in a FPS?  The Ghosts campaign takes you underwater to fight sharks, in space, in cities, in the countryside, etc.  Just how many localities are there anyway?Here is my take on the game:Campaign is about what I expected.  Yeah it's cut and paste, but like I said, there are only so many things you can do in a FPS campaign.  I enjoyed it for what it is to me - a small part of a game that I really bought for multiplayer.The game does have 2 major flaws, no dedicated servers and poor optimization.  I have a good computer, so the second is not a problem.  So my only beef is the no dedicated server part.I have several hundred hours in the game, and look forward to playing it. Here is my recipe for enjoying the game:I have 3 friends that play this game.  We hook up every Friday night and skype each other.  Then one of us creates a game, and the others join.  Sometimes we fight each other, some times we team up and fight bots.  The other night, we played a game of domination (3 of us that night) against, I think, 15 or so bots on hard.  Now that's a tough game.  Search and destroy against a bunch of bots, or maybe one of us and some bots (we bid on the number) against the rest of us.  Sometimes we do knife only fights, or one of us will camp, while the others try to dig him out. I could go on, but you can see the possibilites are almost endless.We have a ton of fun."

Many have begun ripping into the Call of Duty franchise for their lack of originality.  I suppose one could make that argument, but I think they would be missing the point.I've never looked upon the Call of Duty franchise as a game, at least not a regular FPS.  I enjoy Call of Duty for one simple reason, it's an experience.  Period.  It's about 6 to 8 hours of interactive movie making whereby you are along for the ride in typically fantastic, far from reality, scenes of epics battles where even the action will slow down and wait for you should you decide to stroll off to the side somewhere.  Not to worry, they'll call you back soon enough.I had some optimisation issues, but my rig has begun showing its age, so maybe just me.  Otherwise, graphics - solid, controls - solid, sound - fantastic, voice - good.In the end, if you're in the mood for an intereactive cinematic gameplay rush.  This game is for you.

I also dont buy into the campaign storyline. If they could have shot the train in the first place they should have. Revenge is not a compelling story.  Finally, the game engine needs work -- there needs to be a better cover system, less lag, etc to make gameplay really improve.  It hasnt changed for like 5 games now.Matchmaking system is terrible.  Most of the better game types dont have enough people playing, -- unless you have bought all the DLC.I liked the dog though.  Maybe the next one should just be a dude and his dog in a postapocalyptic wasteland.  No heavy weapons.  Just rifles and tactics.Disclaimer: I do still play a fair amount.

It might be time we apologized to all those IW employees who were sacked after Modern Warfare 2 because what is clear now is that the fault lay with the management. And, sorry to say, most of them are still here.Much like MW3, gamers were promised servers and bought the game with that in mind only to find out that that was not the case. Then, some time later, they tried to backpedal and suggest that the system that runs matchmaking was actually what they were talking about when they said ""server"". This, of course, entirely ignores the fact that one of their executive producers had already claimed that servers would be rolling out over time.Short version: they lied. Again. Just like they did with MW3 which they claimed would have servers and then flat out told us that we weren't going to get them, regardless of what they had previously said. There are no servers and there never will be.The resulting game (which another of their employees intimated was only crap because it was never designed to matchmaker based - guess IW don't care who knows they're talking crap) is baaaaaaad to the very nth degree. Lag is a HUGE decider in this game. Have a slow or outdated machine, then the game will either pick you to host or favour your data over that of people who were foolish enough to put their hard-earned cash into their PCs. So it doesn't matter how fast or skilled you are, you will lose to an outdated machine.Snipers: the vast majority of the time, your shots, whether on target or not, will not register. You WILL get angry when you shoot someone several times and they still have time to have coffee, get their nails done and light a cigarette before turning around to shoot you. You're also only given semi-auto pistols as a backup weapon so get used to dying in close quarters. You will have no decent defense.The alternative -> Marksman Rifles (where they have dumped anything that resembles a useful semi-auto rifle): here you will discover a new type of crap, something we haven't seen since the sniper-hating exec that was in charge of Black Ops 1 and openly admitted to nerfing and hindering their capabilities. In short: You can use red-dot sights and the like on them or acog and thermals. The thermals (more accurate here and on assault rifles than on snipers) kick like crazy, so landing more than one shot is time-consuming. The red-dots are good, but reek of an effort to hinder you from a decent magnification with something that would actually snipe well. There IS a sight in game that bridges that gap - the VMR sight - but, of course, they don't let you have that on Marksman Rifles.VAC is almost as non-existent here as in MW2, prepare to see hacker after hacker after hacker. And thanks to lag, that can make killcams appear as if something turned and shot you with unnatural agility, you will be freaking out over who is actually hacking and who isn't.If a match is running slowly and you wanna know who has the bad ping that's dragging you down? Tough crap, they removed ping meters so you couldn't see how badly everyone is running.Expect to have enemies appear to kill you with a single shot, only to watch the kill cam and have it show you that you never even opened fire and your killer was shooting you for flipping years.Expect to regret it if you purchase this game.Expect to wonder where IW get off lying and prejudicing the game against your machine, that you have been pooring your hard-earned money into.Expect to feel stupid for having trusted IW a third time - only to realize that they weren't exactly screaming the name of the development team from the highest mountains and expect to know exactly why that was.Expect to laugh incredulously when you realise that one guy working on his own can give you a program that makes CoD Ghosts' FOV 100 but IW either don't know how to get it above 80 or refuse to. Oh, they ask for more money to get new maps and weapons (weapons that will change the way you have to play if you don't have them) but ask them for something, since you paid for the game, and you can expect to be let down.Expect... Expect to start wondering what method is strong enough and permanent enough to record your decision to never EVER purchase a game made by IW again, after this pathetic excuse for a game that they had no right to charge you for.Still, if you're very, VERY lucky, and your friends make the same mistake you do in buying this game, there's a chance you can have some fun screaming at each other about this mess. But that's as far as it will go."

This game brings with it the spirit of the previous Call of Duty games, along with a whole new set of options to make it more versatile to deal with.  The storyline is just as action-packed as ever despite the long whines of those who believe they've seen it all.  This game is graphic, lengthy, and fast paced. Just what I would expect from a good COD game, and others would B*TCH about worse if it were any different. I'm not even a diehard, I would go play battlefield or planetside just as soon as I would play a COD game. My last COD purchase was MW4. Please do some digging before you let a children turned critics make your decison for ya.  Thirty bucks is VERY reasonable for a game this thick, and despite much of the content being DLCs, they are cheap in comparison to what other game customization markets can be. I would actually take the spam (*cough*) I mean, negative reviews as a good thing. Most of these irrational thinkers wouldn't hesitate to use an exploit with the game, gives us more room to play like adults.

Hit-reg is a joke, suffering the same epidemic as BF4 where what you see on screen isn't actually what is happening in-game, causing you to fire at nothing, take fire from nowhere, and just generally die in multiple BS ways.  Even the 'perks', which have been the CoD staple since the game hit mainstream, are broken and abused nonstop, with specific ones such as the Guard Dog allowing the mutt to not only to through walls to kill, run across the entire map at random to kill, but also to kill multiple times without going away.  It's one of the cheapest perks to get, and also the most deadly.  Nonstop care package and airstrike glitches, ones we have seen since the early life of the series, are still in full-effect as well.The single-player campaign is fun, at least telling a good story, but the real reason people buy and play these games is for multiplayer.  If you are a PC gamer, I could not recommend this at ALL.  Activision just straight-up doesn't give a♥♥♥♥♥♥about your gaming experience, and pretty much used the money they got to further-fund next-year's disappointment.  One I will NOT be buying.

Even if your rig meets (or exceeds) the recommended system requirements, you will experience FPS drops and will not not be able to play the game on decent settings.-No anti-cheat in multiplayer. Roughly 30% of the games I've played online have been totally unplayable due to hackers. Wallhacks, aimbots, hacked prestige lobbies, you name it. Infinity Ward has remained silent on this issue, so it's likely they have no plans to implement any sort of anti-cheat.-The single player is awful. I mean, I wasn't expecting Schindler's List out of a Call of Duty game, but if you actually care about that kind of thing, the plot is nonsensical and the gameplay is boring from beginning to end.-Poor balance in multiplayer. IEDs, Attack Dogs, and the Bulldog shotgun are clearly better than any other lethal/killstreak/weapon.

The almost 30GB storage made me think it was a large game (implying long) but nope, that's for all the damned textures and cutscenes.  The story was good, but the epic moments came when you breach a door and the whole game slows.  Why?  Because the main storyline is horrible.  Ghosts refers to special ops people that are really the best-of-the-best (I'll stick with vagueries so I don't spoil it) and you *shocker* are on your way to becoming one.  As for being the baddest cat around, you sure do suck.  What's that?  An explosion, let me fall down and need someone else to help me up.

Story in the single player is short (Took me 4-5 hours to complete it) and awful, and they throw something in last minute just to create a cliff hanger for the next game. Multiplayer matchmaking is awful as well, they don't even tell you what your PING is believe it or not, and since there's barley anyone playing there's no justification to playing the multiplayer.

The worst Call of Duty game in the franchise and I'm certain the entire community would agree with me (which is rare.) The worst part about this game is how fast the multiplayer died which was around a month or two after launch. If you were to play multiplayer right now, you'd, at most, see 500-2,000 people on globally and you'd sit in a matchmaking queue indefinitely while it searched for non-existent games. CoD has absolutely no following on PC and I will never purchase another CoD game because I am a PC fanatic and Infinity Ward, (who I staunchly supported after they sued themselves for royalties in which case Treyarch took over), simply does not care about the PC population. After Modern Warfare 2, the franchise fell to shambles and hasn't recovered. I'll wait for the next big FPS, however long that may take; anything is better than this garbage.Also, standard military issue weapons in space that ignore gravity and discharge bullets that travel at maximum velocity and have sound?No. L2PHYSICSPLEASE.There's no sound in space, bullets would not travel at maximum velocity in space and bullets would be greatly affected by gravitational forces in...space.

I have a Lenovo Y510p laptop, with two NVidia GT 755M in SLI configuration (not an impressive hardware configuration, but quite respectable). I've managed to play ""Wolfenstein: The New Order"" on it's highest settings (on 1920x1080) which is an amazing game by today's standards, but ""Call of Duty: Ghosts"" pretty much dies/crashes if I try to do the same. This is, of course, because the game is poorly optimized. I contacted support (btw, amazing support team, Activision) and they asked me to downgrade the resolution until the game would stop crashing, which I found (after a couple of tries) was around 1366x768 (which I later confirmed with NVidia's GeForce Experience tool): This is almost 720p, which makes the game horrible to play due to heavy pixelation. On the other hand, the latest Wolfenstein incarnation was incredibly well optimized, so well that it takes a trained eye to realize where optimization happens (e.g., loading and adapting textures on-the-fly as the player scans the scene).For a game on this price range, I would have expected a bit more attention to detail: Since not everybody updates their rig every year, optimization should be a non-brainer for developers such as Activision to reach more end users, who would happily pay for a game that works on a decent piece of hardware. It doesn't take a product manager or marketing person, nor an epiphany, to realize this is important.It's not all the game's fault though: I hope Steam had offered a demo of the game, so that I would have realized about this before buying it (and don't tell me to read the “Game hardware requirements”... they are worthless when there are a gazillion combinations of hardware components in a PC that can alter the performance of a rig)"

Here is my first and most important dislike with Ghosts, FOV.  Field of View (FOV) in Ghosts is set to 65 and there is not a way to change that.  The problem with the FOV being set to 65 means the game is so narrow that the game feels that it is taped to your head, and after prolong exposure one can start to feel sick.Second issue with Ghosts is the graphics and the so called ""new graphics engine"".  The color and graphics seem very outdated.  Some maps are simply grey all over and no life.  Third issue with Ghosts is lack or equal game type amongst server types, hardcore and softcore.  That brings me to number four.  The forth issue is game modes.  Game modes in this game lack in fun and competitiveness.  Instead of making game modes team based like CTF, TKOTH and so on, they made mostly single player style game modes.Lastly, game performance.  Game performance in the new Call of Duty Ghosts is surprisingly weak considering the game graphics seem so flat.  There seems to be only two graphic settings and everything between does not make an impact.  I find setting the graphics quality to Extra then everything else on low or off gives the best image quality and performance, setting everything to ultra still looks identical but with extreme lag to accompany it.So, all of those issues listed and described above makes the game unplayable in my opinion.  I am really sadden because now I have to spend the next two years not playing a FPS game."

This is the first time I've played a CoD game on PC and I wish I got Battlefield 4 instead, The first day I started playing this sorry excuse for a game Half of the lobbies where hacked, I enjoy the challang of getting from rank/level 1 to 60 but when I enter the game at a mere level 15 and I leave lvl 60? Thats bull. I hate that it has come to this but I think im done with CoD as a whole, Except the blackops series, they havnt betrayed me. Im sick of entering a lobby, going into the game and waiting to be teleported into the air and dieing over and over agian like a crazy form of PingPong and Im the ball. Other hacks include aimbotters, God modders, Infinite Chain Gun, Infinite Ammo, Exploding Land, Speed Hacks, Teleport Hacks, Invisible Hacks, and many other, I played less then 2 days of multiplayer and experienced all of these.Enough with the ranting on hacks though, The way they set up prestige is horrible. Traditional CoD Games made it so that you go to lvl 60, restart with a shiny new emblem. Now you need to create a new character, Wtf? There was NOTHING wrong with the prestige mode. You lost your gear but atleast you didnt need to select you character before loading CoD Ghosts up every time. They also decreased your maximum health now so snipers can almost instant kill (which is good because if you need 3 shots from a sniper to kill 1 target, thats pathetic) but since they decreased the health now every one runs around with a submachine gun and 3 bullets from it is a kill. Return the health the the max please and just increase the sniper and pistol damage.You need a map to navigate this game. If you want to set up a clan tag you would assume it would be next to the clan things right? No.The clan tag set up is some where else, I've seen video's where its apparently under customization of one of you toons but who can say? Why is it there?

I will however get CoD Advanced Warfare on PC because I think this one will be better optimized because its made FOR next gen and PC where as ghosts was developed for the 360 and ported to the rest of the platforms.

Ya, the population on PC is horrible... well of course it is when you have people saying what ♥♥♥♥♥♥ graphics it has or it's the same stuff bla bla bla. Bull. The game is fun, it is playable and it is a bit more realistic even with all the fancy kill streaks (which are not half- bad). Is it diffrent that previous cods? Well of course it is! If you just gave it a shot and play the damn thing you will see my point. I watched a vid that was uploaded a week ago of some dudes game play for 42 minutes. All he keeps saying was ""look, see, its still all ♥♥♥♥ed up! oh dear god, kill this peice of crap game now and kill me!""Really? I saw 42 min of nothing wrong. He ♥♥♥♥♥ed and complained for 42 munutes! Its complete tripe that people crap on this version of the game. There was nothing wrong with the game play in that vid besides the dude sucking so much because it was not ""arcady"" enough. Sure he had a few good games, so why was he complaining? Becuase of the elitest trolls that ruin games like this. Don't be one of those people and learn to judge and think for yourself. Ghost is more realistic in terms of taking more cover. You have to work as a team and move like real units are supposed to move (breaching streets, smoke, frags, move in etc). And before you start in with the ""thats not how they do it argument in real life,"" argument... just shut up. I know that.Look. Before I end this rant, I just want you to know that Call of Duty may have a re-branding problem, it may change here and there and you have to adapt, but to out and out hate somthing in which you ""used"" to be great at and now you suck because you dont understand concepts and adaptions and tacticts, give the damn game a fair try with fresh eyes and learn. It's no big deal. Thats all, just try it. It is a fun game and if you don't like it, fine. Don't play it then.END RANT AND REVIEW.(this was more directed to the elitest who hate this game when, in fact, they are crying for help on the inside.

This game is totally not optmised for PC gameplay. Mouse movements are also having some issues, look is only smooth when you use an xbox remote, but you plays using the xbox remote on the PC anyways. Features such as FOV adjustment are just not there. You can change settings in the config files to make your gameplay more enjoyable, but are we, as consumers, even suppose to be messing with those stuff.Multiplayer is terrible. Maps are designed badly, times where you can't find anyone to kill, and end up dead is more frequent. This game seems to be full of hackers in the multiplayer and reporting them doesn't really do anything. Just goes to show that the devs don't really care about PC. Campaign is awsome! However, that alone is not worth the 60 bucks you pay on this game. In the config files, the game is set to search for servers with high ping. This brings laggy gameplay due to internet connection and also you often search games with high ping.Therefore, I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS GAME. This game does not deserve the Call of Duty title."

,Recommended,209160,7787033,"Posted: 27 November, 2013",all,Hobbzillian,"I will be the first to admit that the PC port of this game was a mess when it first launched. However, the recent patches have improved my experience substantially.As for the game itself, I am going to post my review I did for the Murfreesboro Pulse as I write their video game reviews for them. It should be visible by the first week of December as the next issue has not been published yet.""It is that time of year again for gamers. With November comes another Call of Duty, and with it, all the scorn, vitriol, and downright mind boggling hate toward it. Call of Duty Ghosts will not change that. If you hated this series before, there really is nothing here that is going to change that. If you like it, you will more than likely like this one, though I would not be surprised if quite a few were underwhelmed, and even disappointed.At least for this reviewer, the most disappointing aspect of Ghosts is its campaign. The story goes that you are part of an elite squad known as the Ghosts who are fighting back against the Federation. The Federation is an alliance of South American countries, who have managed to significantly weaken the United States to the point where they have a strong foothold in the south. While the premise may seem odd or even ridiculous, my hopes were pinned on the writer, Stephen Gaghan, who did one of my favorite political thrillers Syriana and who had also won an academy award for Traffic. Unfortunately those hopes were dashed.As a fan of the Call of Duty campaigns, this iteration falls surprisingly short from the standards set by previous games. The writing is lackluster at best. The story gets you where you need to go, but does not compel you to care. It is predictable without being engaging, in large part due to the lack of character in this story. Case in point, there is hardly any character in Ghosts.  The people you meet and fight with are, at least for the most part, stoic to the point of boredom. Even the voice acting is mostly bland and lacks passion, almost like they phoned it in at points, which surprising considering that Call of Duty usually nails that aspect of itself. Ironically, the non-human in the game, Riley the dog, ends up being more engaging and worthy of your attachment than the humans.On the flipside, though hardly compelling, the campaign itself is still entertaining enough to compel you to finish it. The set pieces continue to amaze and it provides a good variety of different sequences to keep you engaged. In fact, some of the more creative level designs of this franchise can be found here, from gun battles in space, battles under the sea, to very smooth tank battles, and even a stealth sequence in a bog that this reviewer found very engaging. Oh, and you get to sick the dog on soldiers. It never gets old!Whereas the campaign falls short, the multiplayer portion is where Ghosts stands back up and delivers in spades. Ghosts is probably the most refined Call of Duty experience yet. The overhauled engine looks very good and shows off much improved animations.  An optional contextual lean element allows you to lean from cover whenever they aim down the sights, and a slide mechanism lets players slide when they are sprinting. While these may seem like gimmicks, they are actually clever gameplay elements that will force players to learn and master if they want to be among the better rankers. This reviewer had a first-hand account of such mastery. Upon dying, I saw my killer’s killcam: he was coming up the stairs, sprinted to the window, slid to the side and then leaned down his sights and shot me. His/her timing was impeccable.The multiplayer itself is brimming with a stunning amount of content, refinements, and additions. While I cannot talk about all of them for the sake of brevity, I can rundown the major points that shine in this iteration.New modes such as Cranked and Blitz bring some unique variety. In Cranked, when you kill someone, you get bonuses to your character that last for 30 seconds. If you do not kill someone in that time frame, you die. This is great for discouraging camping. In Blitz, it is almost like a soccer match where you have to get to your opponents’ goal line to score while stopping them from getting to yours. I have found this mode to be quite fun. In-game there are field orders that you can grab upon an enemy’s death that offer you a challenge such as getting a certain number of headshots or melee kills. Upon completion of such challenge, you receive an award in the form of replenished ammo and a care package.  New and modified killstreaks along with surprisingly large and varied maps help to differentiate Ghosts from the pack. Those expecting the close quarters combat of previous titles are in for a surprise.One of the biggest overhauls though is the character customization and squads mode. You can now create your own solider down to their gender. It is not Skyrim level, but it at least allows for players to input their own personalities into the characters.Squads mode is where I will be finding myself spending the most time. The major draw point here is that you can now customize and build your own squad to take on other players’ squads. There is almost a simulation feel to the whole thing, though not quite at that point yet. For this reviewer though, the best thing about this mode is Safeguard. Building on one of my favorite modes in Modern Warfare 3, Survival, Safeguard is a horde mode where you hold out against increasing waves of enemies. Up to four players (up from two in MW3) must hold out as long as set, using guns, knives, care packages, and pretty much everything at your disposal. It is a lot of fun, though admittedly tough.The final and most unique addition to Ghosts has to be Extinction mode. Piggy backing off Nazi Zombies in previous games, you and up to three others must destroy alien hives while also holding off waves of alien foes. It may sound like another horde mode and in a sense it is, but it is more hectic and has its own style of play that will require multiple attempts and experimentation to master.A final note on multiplayer, thank you for bots! If you want to hone your skills or just do not care for playing against real players, this option is a godsend.In the end, Call of Duty Ghosts comes down to, what are you looking for? A compelling campaign like the previous titles? Look elsewhere. Major shakeups to the Call of Duty formula? Nope. However, if you are looking for content and refinement in a slick package, you need not look further.  Call of Duty Ghosts is the game for you.4/5""If you want to see more of my reviews, and with pictures, feel free to drop by the Pulse's video game page:http://boropulse.com/category/movies-games/video-game-reviews/"

The campaign is amazing and very well developed. Not in a long time, since Call of Duty Black Ops, have I received such an epic feel when playing through the missions and experiencing the epic cut-scenes. It feels great to start a Call of Duty campaign with a different and fresh plot, along with new characters, much like the story from Call of Duty 4 Modern Wafare. The Multiplayer is excellent! The character customization is the best part for people like me, and the squad concept makes it better! The maps are good and the weapons and perk system is great and well balanced.The game deserves great attention, and fans like me, honestly appreciate this game and the developers for their hard work. Again, this game is amazing and the campaign of the game is my favorite aspect. I am very much excited and looking foward to the sequel!""Legends Never Die. The Ghosts are real.""   9.5/10"

The multiplayer gameplay feels fantastic and the equipment you are given at the start is actually useful so higher ranking players are not overkill against new players. Hip firing also seems to result in much more missing so you actually have to aim to be accurate rather than people running around constantly shooting.overall really good game and may finally be a CoD game I enjoy as much as CoD4

It lacks the story or the amazing multiplayer to even come close to deserving that kind of pay.

I won't completely bash the game. It was fun and I did enjoy playing. The story line wasn't bad and the end shocked me.. then kept me wondering whats next. I sat threw the credits and to my surprise there was a 10-30sec game play that makes you think.. ""humm"". Over all I would recommend the game to play. I do like the online play. Even tho it took the COD series countless games to start to figure out what the player wants. I also think the different game modes (Squads, Common Multi-player, and Extinction) are a good add to the game. I enjoy Extinction, even tho its not Zombies from Black Ops. It certainly has a feel like that. The set up for the players is good better then most of the last's. But as everything it has flaws. I do recommend the game and give it a go. What the worst that could happen?"

Could be a bit better optimized for PC but still delivers the goods.. Found this game to be much more enjoyable with a lobby of good friend/players...Be careful though..A few ""hacked lobbies"" have created false VAC bans on some players that do not cheat and Activision and infinity ward won't do♥♥♥♥♥♥about it, or state why, or give proof of the infraction. Although I know many have cheated and been caught, which we do applaud, some players have been thrown in hacked lobbies and paid the price later with a Ban..beware.."

I went in and could comment on my case, but it was already marked ""RESOLVED"" - When I phone in and try to enter the case # to speak to a Customer Service Rep, the Case # is now invalid, due to being resolved.Way to go, Activision!
