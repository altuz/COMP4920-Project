It has some humor, a nice art style, and solid gameplay. I barely paid anything for it, and that’s really a shame. With all this fuss over engines and production values, it’s a shame that very few developers actually work towards making a substantial game that is more flesh than flash.Stealth Edmund from Shakespeare's King Lear is a mix of puzzle, platforming, and stealth (of course) that takes cues from greats like the Portal series. Though there are definite shades of Glad0s written on the walls, Stealth Fitzroy manages to carve out its own identity. This game relies more on hasty stealth rather than the slow sneaking that other games of the genre tend to have. However, despite how much speed is required and encouraged, it is all still just as calculated as any other stealth game: there all kinds of hazards, patrolling guards, and time sensitive obstacles that will kill your clone over and over again.There is lots of replay in the form of unlocks and leaderboards. Meeting certain goals, finding helices, and so on determine the gear that you can unlock to replay a level. The gear changes gameplay a bit, and making a top score might be a reward in itself if you so with it.It is interesting that I finished this game after The Swapper. Both deal with similar subject matter and share at least one gameplay aspect (puzzle platforming), but they seem to handle it in a different way. Whereas The Swapper focused on the self and what it is to be, Stealth Son of Henry I has its own message delivered in a less subtle way. The game, while humorous, is quite dark. The sparse narration, wall writing, and gameplay all have some heavy implications.It was my mistake not to play this game sooner: it’s a delightful challenge with character at a great value.*The DLC: I will leave the soundtrack up to the individual to decide, but The Teleporter Chambers are a must buy for fans: the freedom and strategy are raised along with the challenge."

Even at full price.Yes, unfortunately the gadgets are only unlocked after finishing the game and therefore mostly reserved for speed runs or acquiring the helix.  They would however have made the game too easy the first time around and are there for exactly that: people who want to do speed runs and acquire every helix.This game gets reviewed as a ""fast platformer"" quite a lot.  Most of the time you can pause, stand around, contemplate your next move, take a breather, push a block at your own place etc.  Then when you are ready to go you need to be quick but shortly afterwards you can relax again.  There are however a couple of levels/instances where you have to constantly move or perform a series of fast actions in succesion.  Overall however I experienced the game to be more of a contemplative nature.The community levels are also great.Worth the money. Even at full price."

It has a great asthetic with interestingly designed levels. It just doesn't hold my interest. One big reason is that the gadgets in the trailers are only available for speed runs and even then, thats only after grinding. Additionally the game kind of ran a little long for me, I wasn't invested in finishing the story because I didn't feel drawn in by it. Just occaisionally amused.Again though. It's well design and if you like puzzle platformers, it will probably be fun for you."

With charming graphics, some elements of stealth, Portal-esque humour, genuinely interesting puzzles, AND A LEVEL EDITOR, I recommend you get this game, sale or no sale.Be warned, though, that this is not a stealth game like Thief or Dishonored are.

,Not Recommended,209190,14617108,"Posted: 23 February, 2015",all,"""Bob"" the Space Cadet","Stealth ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Deluxe is a stealth based puzzle platformer, and it's pretty damn good when it comes to meeting those basic criteria. You need to hide in darkness and pick your moments to leave cover so that you don't get detected. You have to solve a bunch of puzzles like moving blocks around through teleporters to put them onto switches so you can move through gates or deactivate lasers and that sort of thing. Lastly there's lots of carefully timed jumps to make so that you can get over lasers, saw-blades and robots. Some of the levels can be quite tricky, which makes it very rewarding to finally figure out a solution.Despite being a great stealth puzzle platformer I still felt that my time hadn't been that well spent. The game is technically very good, but it's just not that enjoyable. When shadows are so important to a game, they somehow made them emanate at some really weird angles. It would have been nice if they made clear light sources so you could more easily see the platforms and predict the shadow that would appear behind them. I want to get caught and die because I'm bad at a game, not because of faulty physics making objects cast shadows at weird angles from no clear light source.While playing this game, I kept feeling that I was a minion from the animated film ""Dispicable Me"", who had been thrust into a cheesy ""Portal"" knock-off. Why did it feel like a ""Portal"" knock-off? Stealth ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ is based on testing chambers through which you are guided by condescending text projections (lets not even mention the blue/orange teleporters) which were supposed to provide instruction and humour, but just came across as being pretentious. I know I should have expected some lame smack-talking humour from a game with a name like ""Stealth ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥"", but still, this game left me disappointed because the gameplay was pretty much spot on, but the style and mood was lacking and abrasive.The bottom line? If you want a great stealth based puzzle platformer, then this game is for you, but only if you can get past being a minion in a poorly lit, and slightly Portal flavoured (though somewhat sour) testing facility.5/10 would not test.Please note: I played this entirely on my laptop on the train so due to poor mobile internet connections my play time might not be accurate. I played the game from start to finish."

It always felt like it was right in front of my face.Great game, and I can't wait to see what the devs cook up in the future!"
,Recommended,209190,24032954,"Posted: 2 July, 2016",all,YellowLab,"This game is an action platform stealth game. The game is divided into eight levels with seven stages on each that must be finished in order (you do get three skips - I didn't use any). The last (eighth) stage is a boss level containing an ""all-seeing"" eye that you must avoid detection or be nearly instantly lasered to death.You must hide in the dark to avoid detection by robots, drones, cameras and such. Most exits require terminals to be hacked to unlock the door. Hacking the terminals may also change features in the levels. Each level contains a hidden (sometimes in plain sight) helix. Grab that an exit the stage on all the stages to unlock a secret stage (number 10). Also, each stage will grade you S-D. Get an S mark on all stages and unlock secret stage number 9.The pacing for the game is very good. Each new level adds new elements and combines them with the old. The last level (8) was a bear because it introduced an alternate clone running through the level. You need to keep him alive to access other areas, but clones are expendable. After you conquer a stage you unlock equipment that you can use in the level. Beating a level unlocks equipment for that stage. Acquiring three of the same equipments unlocks that equipment for all stages in that level. You can not use the equipment to acquire ""S"" marks for the secret stage, but you can use the equipment to snag helices. Equipment includes things such as a camo clock, noise maker, or teleporters. These are not necessary except to add different ways to play with the levels.The techno music fits the theme and is great. The ending is perfect and had me laughing.This game gets a 9/10 in my book. Gets knocked a point for locking resolution at 640 by 360 (does scale), a couple of levels that were timed, several of the helices that were damn near impossible to get, a couple of the timings to get ""S"" without being detected, and the entire level 8 to try and get ""S"" marks. Other than that - awesome game."

However, like many games that present stealth as a feature it ends up being more aboutsneaking quicklyrather than some of the more methodical incarnations of stealth that the player might have in mind when they purchase the game. That being said I don't feel like the game's creators advertise the game as something other than what it is and I knew what I was getting when I picked it up.ProsNice pixel art graphics (with an unobtrusive scanline filter that looks decent and doesn't detract).Responsive controls.Decent music which although repetitive isn't actually obnoxious.Game is presented with a good ""personality"" and sense of humor.Ranking system that feels at least somewhat worthwhile (i.e. redoing stages and perfecting your performance to get and ""S"" rank).ConsNot much to say here. The game is what it is and I knew what it was before I bought it. What it does, it does well.SubjectiveActual stealth (i.e. cloaking yourself) only exists as a suit which unlocks on a per-stage basis but only after completing the stage and additional time.Game focuses a bit too much on ragey insta-death-centric game play where redoing stages many times (and dyinga lot) is necessary to receive the best rank. Since the game doesn't have extensive progression goals or rewards, rank seems more important.Takes a page from retro gaming's reward dynamic and emphasizes getting the high score (best time, etc.) but doesn't do much else to compel you to keep playing. Fortunately the game play is solid enough to carry the experience.Overall I had fun with this game. It's one of those games that's good but not great and could easily be great with a few tweaks and perhaps a bit more content. It could easily be anotherGunpointif the developers would find a way to impart a greater sense of purpose to the player and (since I'm being honest) if it didn't occasionally make me want to smash my keyboard. I only played for just under 7 hours and I could definitely see others playing it more (a lot more). For me though the experience ofStealth B@stardwas only pretty good though and I'm going to recommend it based in the idea that I feel strongly that others will enjoy it as much if not (much) more than I did since it is a solidly built game that plays well and has an endearing style."

I found the puzzles to be inventive, the controls are fluid and reactive, and the graphics are quite aesthetically pleasing.

You know those stealth games where you spend up to 5 minutes waiting until you get a clear path? Right, in this game, try five seconds. The game doesn't offer just that, though. With it's mechanics, it ends up offering an experience that kind of resembles a fast-paced puzzler.The game has a big focus on staying in the shadow and not making noise. Most enemies can't see you if you aren't doing any of these things. However, puzzle elements also enter the mix and things just get amazing when you get on a platform with a laser coming in from above and the only way out is doing some amazing stunt.The campaign has 8 chapters (more if you buy the teleporter chambers dlc) with 10 levels each: 7 main levels, 1 boss and two secret levels unlocked by uncovering secrets and doing amazing in levels. These secret levels and also characters unlocked by completing the levels add up to plenty of replay value.Finally, the big epic: the level editor. This nifty tool is amazing. It allows you to create levels, like you'd expect. But the amazing thing is, it's the EXACT SAME TOOL used to create the actual game levels. As you might guess, this gives you a LOT of freedom. I myself have made two levels so far. It's actually pretty nifty and not as hard to use as one might think. Sadly, most users make dumb levels with close to no challenge and simply don't bother putting effort into making them look good. Still, occasionally you might run into a good level. Occasionally.Anyway, that's my recommendation. Get this game, trust me. You won't regret it."

It advertises itself as a stealth game, but to be sure, it's definitely a piece of a larger puzzle. Like many other platformers, it includes multiple types of enemies, multiple ""worlds"" with different mechanics prevalent in each, and pressing A to jump.I liked it! I'm a fan of platformers, so that definitely hit the spot. However, the cool part was the puzzle solving. It wasn't anything as strenuous as the talos principle or more dedicated puzzle games, but there were definitely some sweet ""ah-ha!"" moments that are the appeal of puzzle games in general. That being said, the game took 3 hours to complete (the basics, without even trying to get good scores or find pickups) so there weren't as many of those moments as I would have liked.Ultimately, I'd recommend stealth ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. It just might be a tiny bit too expensive for my tastes, but it was definitely fun, and definitely engaging while I played it. It's the kind of game that I'll have to go back and play again to really get the full experience of.EDIT: I forgot to mention that on the first startup, there was a pretty significant graphical glitch where the screen wasn't being displayed.

It's been said that it's aiming towards being the Super Meat Boy of stealth and that makes a certain kind of sense. It's fast, it's brutal and it has no qualms in killing you over and over and over again. The art of something like this is, of course, is that the deaths feel fair and they're never anything but. It is death as learning experience but not death as rote learning experience. It's teaching you each time to be better equipped against whatever thing that crops up next and then, for good measure, combining it with something else you've come across because that's the art of a tremendously good arcade game.And I guess that's what Stealth ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ is, really.

However, it also feels good when you finally nail a level. There are frequent checkpoints, so when you die, you wont lose too much progress. There are eight sectors, each with eight maps, and each new sector introduces a new type of hazard which keeps the game fresh. Theres alot of scope for replayability, unlocking gadgets, trying for a better rank by getting fast times and low number of deaths, and community created maps.

It needs a 'sort by top' system similar to websites like reddit.Good thing: Different abilities mean different ways to solve maps.Bad thing: Each level has to be played with the preceding ability to unlock it. This has to be done at least three times per 'world'. You'll end up playing the same levels over and over again.Sketchy thing: Unlockable levels, based on your score and if you've found all the little unlocking items respectively.Bad things: Often, these items are hidden in false walls and under deathtraps, meaning that you need either extreme luck to find them or you have to intentionally suck at a level.

I love it!"
,Recommended,209190,8950418,"Posted: 2 February, 2014",all,Muscle Moose,"8/10Just a fantastic, charming, and addictive stealth-action-puzzle game. This was way too fun!Each world introduced one new aspect of the game, which, due to the nature of the game's great puzzles, introduced much more with each level. These new game mechanics never get repetitive, as the game keeps everything fresh all the time. Furthermore, by the end of the game, it didn't feel like the game was just dragging on, ya know? It felt like a complete game with just the right length.The story is, of course, very minimal, but absolutely charming :P.Now, to the two points that were taken away. The checkpoint system was sometimes annoying. The game has a lot of timing, and at times the checkpoint system will really mess you over. I mean, the game isn't so hard that you'd not consider restarting the level, but when you're in the flow, you just wanna keep going, right? That's a point off for me.The other point is for performance. There were times where I'd respawn and all of a sudden the game fastforwarded or something? it felt like a bad V-sync or something. Really distraughting. The game would also slowdown at random seemingly.Anyway, game's a lot of fun. I really didn't think I'd get this much enjoyment out of it, but hell yeh, it was great. I definitely recommend it if you're into puzzlers and stealth games. Just too much fun :)"

However due to the time pressure it feels more of a platformer than a stealth infiltration game. So this might not be to anyone taste.This is a mix of platform/puzzle/stealth games. With simple but  serviceable gfx.The first time you play a level it is more like a steatlth and puzzle, as you try to figure how you can reach the exit avoiding all security systems and opening doors. Your receive a letter grade (A-D) for your performance which takes into account time/death/# times spotted. This part of the game is thoroughly enjoyable. Taking your time to explore the level and solve the puzzles is atmospheric and challenging.Then the PROBLEM is that in order to achieve the best grade S (for stealth) you should complete the puzzle in a very short time without being spotted at all. And now  the game turn into a very tight timed platformer, where you must be very precise in your moves and jump. Hopefully the controls are quite good and the character is very agile and capable of changing direction in mid air. Yet getting a S grade on some level can be very hard and you may have to repeat the level many times to get a perfect result. BE WARNED that this part can be really nerves wrecking, and you'll realize why there is the B.....D word in the game title.Note that each stage is mad of 8 levels and getting a S grade on the 8 level is not necessary to move to the next stage, it merely unlock a bonus 9th level on each stage."

Stealth ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ has so far been quite a treat for me. The title stars clones, who resemble them minions of Dispicable Me. A bit kiddy, if you think about it, but you soon forget it once you get mangled in so many different ways if you fail to deliver skillwise. It's pretty straight forward - you traverse through a clone facility ulitlizing stealth and unlocked gadgetry along the way. If you're no achievement ♥♥♥♥♥ it might end pretty quick. But the lifespan of a level is usually three rounds if you want to get the Secrets and a S Rank.I've just finished the first sector, and it's pretty good.
