However, I will warn the Sherlock purists that this game has only a very passing relationship to the book so if you're looking for a HO-version of the classic, you very well might hate this.  The story is really very different.In terms of general gameplay this is a pretty standard game for the genre, with HO scenes mixed with minigame puzzles and the usual inventory-based puzzles.  Where it departs from the norm is with a handful of special ""powers"" unlocked throughout the game that add to the puzzles; while in some cases it's apparent what you have to use and when, other times it took some thought and I appreciated that.Puzzles and minigames themselves are average difficulty, not hard but not too easy, with the exception of one or two of the minigames that were just obnoxious; however there is a skip button or if you're intent on getting a no-skip achievement, there are solutions online (I confess to being guilty of looking up one or two solutions for that reason).Sound and voice acting is nothing stellar but definitely better than the average, if you consider that most HO games have extremely poor voice acting.All in all, a great game with some unique aspects that make it stand out.  Worth it if you're a fan of this style of game."

No wonder they have an achievement just to watch the whole thing without skipping. No one would watch them otherwise...Nice game to get 100% achievements on and not too much work getting either."

This time Frogware is just a publisher not the developer and this choice is evident in many ways inside the game.This short adventure starts With Henry Baskerville asking Sherlock Holmes to help him to break the curse of his family which involves a big Hound that brutally kills all of the Baskerville family members from generations. Now, for those who are familiar with Sherlock Holmes and the original novel, yes: this is not exactly a faithful transposition but it's more like an interpretation... Which works good and bad at the same time. Good beccause the adventure in a big mansion where a Demonic dog is supposed to be is quite a good idea giving the game a good dark atmosphere. Bad because this interpretation involves magic and time travel (without any particular consequence, so it's just an excuse to have another room with riddles with a few minor graphic differences), which really don't belong in a Sherlock Holmes adventure.As a Hidden Object game The gameplay doesn't need much explanation. You need to explore rooms or other ambiences, pick up items, interact with various objects and when you focus on determined zones you will be requested to find a long list of items very well hidden in the screen. Besides that you can find a very long list of puzzles and riddels, some of them are quite easy, but there are few VERY TOUGHT ones that forced me to get some help to deal with them.This title can count on a good soundtrack most of the times trying to give a tense atmosphere, maybe even more than necessary. Besides that Holmes, Watson and Henry Baskerville will often talk during the adventure and not just with captions as already happened with the persian carpet, but we can hear the original voice cast for our two protagonist, which is really appreciated.The worst side of this title I believe is the menu and game system, where you don't save because it's an automatic progress but you can't start a new game befor you completely finish it first unless you erase and create a new game profile... An operation that will delete your (ingame) achievements, which is the reason that took me 5 runs instead of just 2 to fully achieve the game.+++PROs+++GOOD ADVENTURE.All in all this title represent a good adventure, with tough Hidden Object sections, Some very Hard Puzzles and Riddles, with easier ones, various dialogues with characters and a nice soundtrack.---CONs---MAGIC.Actually This version of the Hound of the Baskervilles doesn't really suit a Sherlock Adventuremostly because it doesn't give an explanation at the end even though for all the time Sherlock says there Must be an explanation.SAVE SYSTEM AND MENU.This game doesn't have a way to restart the game unless you finish it first and the only way to do that is to erase your ingame profile and make a new one. But this way you will lose all your ingame achievements, and I don't recall being informed of this at the moment."

,Recommended,209230,21374328,"Posted: 21 February, 2016",all,HimeJezabel,"Unlike most of the other Sherlock Holmes games on Steam, this is more a classic Hidden Object type game rather than Point & Click or FMV. It's a perfectly good game for its genre with good HO scenes and logic in puzzles. The puzzle type and difficulty varies greatly throughout the game; most are doable without guide or hints.The story follows Sherlock Holmes and Doctor Watson as they go with Lord Baskerville to his mansion to find out why his bloodline has apparently been cursed and his ancestors all died to this curse by being attacked by the creature known as the Hound of the Baskerville.As a Sherlock story it's a bit... blasphemous; the story has heavy focus on supernatural theme and there no logical solution is found (this is not really a spoiler),The game has good visual progress with throughout the game you complete ""badges"" to unlock powers to get into new rooms. Not really sure if this is good or not as it reminded me a bit too much of the much more child-friendly Princess Isabella games.All achievements are easily earned; the one it says you get for ""completing the game"" is actually earned for Easy mode only, and as it has an achievement for completing Hard mode, you'll have to play it through twice to get all achievements. All dialogues can be skipped and as I accidentally clicked away a sentence said by a character, I can only assume that the ""do not skip"" achievement is only messed up if you click ""skip"" on dialogues entirely and not for normal left-click for skipping the sayings individually.I didn't have too much problem with the voice-acting; Sherlock is a bit more enthusiastic in this game than he is in the later P&C games Testament and Crimes and Punishment. The sound effects and music is pretty good, but if you play League of Legends it might annoy you that in one musictrack there are sounds almost identical to ""found a game"" and ""game invite"" in LoL.Buy more for the Hidden Object genre than for it being a Sherlock Holmes game. You may wanna buy it on a discount as it's getting a bit old, but it's a very enjoyable game."

There is a nice story, lots of achievements and great atmosphere. Some hidden object scenes are rather easy, but mostly the difficulty is average and most of the objects can be found (even if some are very well hidden).There are a lot of puzzles from easy to average, only one that is really tough - but you can always skip.So if you like HO games, this is definitely one of the good ones."

However, as a point-and-click puzzle game, I think it works very well. There's a variety of puzzles in addition to the hidden object games, and although most aren't too difficult, there are some challenging ones. Additionally, one thing I appreciated about this game was the map interface, which not only showed you which rooms still had tasks to do in them but also allowed you to teleport there by clicking on the room. Overall, I'd say that this game is a jaunt into a far more mysticized Sherlock Holmes story, complete with an interesting plot and a few fun moments with the characters. If you like hidden object games or puzzle games in general, I would recommend it."

,Recommended,209230,9669279,"Posted: 29 March, 2014",all,Ron AF Greve,"Normally I am not much into hidden object games. More an Adventure/RPG type of gamer. But this game is done very well. It is very loosely based on 'The Hound of the Baskervilles' (actually so loosely that it has little to do with it ), however the creators just made a game that is fun to play and that is more important than trying to make a game realistic or following some story.Contrary to most adventure/casual games this has quite a lot of different kind of puzzles. For instance, one based on planar graphs, a puzzle based on rotating groups of tiles (which I found the most difficult yet solvable after a little thought), a few about identifying objects in a scene etc. It is nice to see a game with such a variety. The renderings are awesome. Don't expect much animation though the game is mainly still pictures with some animation happening when you solve a puzzle but the game still looks gorgeous.Another thing is that the game isn't too easy yet can be solved without a walkthrough. There are also buttons that let you skip a puzzle when you are stuck or ask for help. I skipped one puzzle ( the one where you have to compare, the painting of a vase, to the 'real thing' and find the differences) because I needed to quit).I clocked in about 16 hours."

Although I actually hoped it would meet the standard for the other Sherlock Holmes games. If you want to feel the real deal of the experience, this game won't satisfy the craving. The show is more engaging or the source material. It is a good hidden object game, just not a good Sherlock Holmes game."

Unlike the terrible Sherlock Holmes: Mystery of Persian Carpet, this game is vastly improved in every way. Story is without a doubt the weakest link, but would you really expect a respectful interpretation of the original story in hidden objects game? It's fine and if you accept it for what it is, it's really not that bad, just think of it as a non-canon supernatural tour through the Baskerville manor.Gameplay is great, difficulty is quite low, which is fine by me, I don't want to be stuck for too long on strange puzzles or impossible to see objects. Achievements are nice as well, motivates you to do them, since they're not too hard. Overall I've thoroughly enjoyed playing it."

It takes the basic plot of the novel (demonic dog targets family) and then goes batshit crazy with it. Fortunately, they do it in such a fun way that I don't think it detracts from the game at all.It's a very good-looking point-and-click game with some pretty good puzzles and very good pacing. Sure, there are too many Hidden Objects puzzles, but those are so easy and short that I was never annoyed by it. Puzzles vary in difficulty and there are a few types of puzzles that make a second appearance, but there's still a lot of variation.The music is a bit overly dramatic, but certainly not bad. Not memorable either, though. Controls and the map work really well and the whole thing is well executed, although the dialogue and cinematics are mediocre.Still, all the parts you actually play are a lot of fun, provided you don't worry about canon or taking things too seriously."

It does have a couple interesting tack-ons, such as the Elements, and a couple tough puzzles, particularly towards the end.Art is decent and I didn't find the HO scenes too dark, which can absolutely ruin a HO game.There are only two difficulty levels - Easy and Hard.  Hard is more like Casual in other HO games.  Hints are available, and without penalty, an auto-hint will alert your next move if you take too long in a room, and the map notates rooms that have a current puzzle or object available.As a couple others have stated, the story is rather ludicrous, but worst is the voice acting.  Now, Frogwares, I'm sure you didn't have a large budget for the voice acting, but you could have at least had the actors slow down a little and use the punctuation properly when they were speaking.  It was like they were speed reading the script.Lastly, I was very disappointed with the end.  It just kind of...ended."
