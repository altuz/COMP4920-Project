76561198019205444,Not Recommended,209270,3228720,"Posted: 12 August, 2012",all,sitebender,"DO NOT buy this game. It is a multi-player game that claims to have a solo campaign. The solo campaign are challenges like an extended tutorial. So what is this game? A turn based strategy like a complex game of chess with a board where you either destroy crystals or the other players to win the match.Why is multiplayer bad? Because it is turn based, you finish your turn and then wait for the other person to complete their turn. How long does that take? Could be one minute, or it could be hours or days. In fact there is an achievement if you take 24 hours to make a turn. Rewarding someone for wasting someone else's time is never a good thing. To compensate for this, you can play a lot of games at once. Like chess via mail. I was so bored playing this game that I literally opened up another game to play it as I waited for people to perform their turns and get back to me.When you start a match, you select from one of your owned factions. You start with humans and TF2 factions when you own the game. Then if you want the other races like Elves, Dwarves, Shaolin and Tribes, its $5 each. Each faction has its own characters that play differently."

It is NOT pay to win as another reviewer has written. Strategy is key to victory here, not cash.  If you think this game is pay to win then you obviously haven't put in the patience required to learn each team's strengths and weaknesses and adjust your strategy accordingly.  There are additional teams that one CAN purchase if they wish, it doesn't matter if you choose not to though, as all of the teams (although quite unique) are exceptionally well balanced.The game can be a bit buggy.. eg. Sometimes you're greeted with a blank board and it's neccessary to refresh the game state before the pieces appear.  The strategy involved is on par with chess, perhaps not as rich as some players would like (It's no Magic The Gathering). Some people complain that players are not forced to move within a time limit. I happen to like this feature of the game as I can leave the game minimized while I am working and take my turn when I am ready.In spite of it's minor short comings, Hero Academy succeeds in providing interesting and engaging turn-based strategy game play, which if you're a fan of such games you know there are far too few of them on the market."

It's just different from what I expected.When I bought this game I was expecting some cool things like missions, custom games, and multiplayer.  Heck, maybe a couple different game modes.  Instead, I opened the game and the first thing I get is a tutorial shoved in my face that explains everything I could have figured out in two seconds.  Then it gives me a multiplayer option and a customization option.  Of course, I want to see what I can customize.Originally, you can change your avatar and not much else.  Everything else is DLC.  Actually, everything in GENERAL is DLC.  You want to change your team color? DLC!  You want to play the other three team options?  DLC!  You want to play the mission mode I was ever so hoping for?  DLC!  You want to play the other game modes?  Well there arent any other game modes but if there was that would probably be DLC as well.  So after I realize that I can't play mission mode, I sigh and try to play multiplayer.  Since I enjoy TF2 quite a bit, I decide to go with that team instead of the other one that I have.Well I start playing for like 30 minutes or so and I'm enjoying it.  There is a door at the bottom left with a turn number counting down.  I thought that was the amount of turns you had left before the game ended.  Nope.  It's how many turns you have left before you can surrender.  That's when I realize how LONG these games are.  They are like, really, really long.  Like, REALLY long.  Also, the learning curve is freaking gigantic.  90 minutes in I still don't know what in the heck half of my characters do.  And it seems like the teams you can buy are EXTREMELY overpowered.  I swarmed the guy with soldiers, demos a scout and a medic and in one turn one of his characters walked up and killed 3 of the 5.  It took me 3 turns to kill the character that did the deed.But in the end, if you have the attention span of a goldfish like me and don't like having to buy DLC to get everything that the game promised I really don't recommend this.  Although if you like games like this, have patience and don't care about money, this game is for you.Oh and one more thing: This game is an iPhone port and feels like an iPhone port.  Fair warning."

I played a solid 10 hours on release and had a pretty good time battling with my friends.Even if you aren't playing with your friends, the internet multiplayer option allows for quick and seamless matchmaking, meaning you can play as and when you want.However, a few specificities of the game kind of ruin it. By default, the opening ""move allowance"" is set to be unfair against the person who creates the game, meaning that very very option (unless manually de-selected) your opponent (or you) will have a +3 or -3 move advantage, which very much affects the late stages of the game when every move counts.This, for me, tilted the tables. I no longer felt I was playing a game, I felt I was inadvertantly cheating. Since then, I haven't played anymore.A good game, but tweaking required for it to be fair. But, if you tweak your settings, you need to rely on your opponent doing so as well (which, by the way, they wont).Nilesy"

The things that work for a game on the mobile platform do not translate 1:1 to the PC world, and most of the flaws I found when playing Hero Academy were due to wanting it to be something it is not, and probably never intended to be.

76561198021174209,Recommended,209270,33888214,Posted: 29 July,all,Darkever,"Hero Academy is an amazing strategic multiplayer game. I played it for two years and truly enjoyed it thoroughly!!! (WOW, 179 hours!? I noticed only now!)In a sense, it feels like chess, with fantasy characters and many many many more units. You choose one among the 6 available teams and are paired against a random opponent (or a friend) in a random arena. Your objective is to destroy all opponent's crystals or kill all of their units.All teams are very different between each other and all units are useful in their own way (except you Windblade, you just suck). This opens up nearly endless strategies, depending on the units you get at start - the only RNG part of the game - the team you are facing, the map chosen, and so many other factors.Since it's turn-based and you have to wait for your opponents to respond, it's perfect to play in short burst; I often played it on my phone during breaks at work and then on my PC when I got home. I usually had 10-20 games open, so I there was always at least one ready.Pro:- Cute character design- Extremely tactical, with very little RNG- Tons of replayability (I played it 179+ hours, no jokes)- Great to play on your phone when you have only 5-10 minutes free- Teams are unique and have very different units and strategies- Teams are very very balanced- You have all the time you want toCons:- You typically can't play it for long sessions- I'm not sure how many people still play this game. Still, I bet you can still find opponents!- You get only two teams with the basic game, so you'll have to buy the rest. But they are worth it! (I think they are much cheaper on mobile shops, so better to buy them there)- In high level games, you may have to resort to some basic math pretty often- In high level games, ""standstill"" situations may happen, where the board is very balanced. They often take some time to break... like chess.Hero Academy is easily the best turn-based strategy game I ever player, and one of the best games in my list overall! I wholeheartedly recommend it! 9/10"

You play the game with a lot of players making choices before ending their turn giving you plenty of time to face other oppenets at the same time while waiting for them to make a move which can make the game extremly active worldwide. As of for the support team, they are very active as of 2015 and seem to be hardly busy at times when you are trying to contact them. When I requested an email and in-game nickname change, they respounded very fast til the end of my needs were over.Great game, fun with or without friends, and highly active all times.

I hear complaints about slow games, because it was originally developed for mobile devices; but if you get passed that(and there are some steam groups for faster games), it's a blast. I just treat it like a slow moving game I come back to and every now and then you get a few good plays back to back before you or your opponent quit playing again.It's like some weird version of chess that just comes out fun. I like the TF2 team exclusive to steam players too.The price of the game is a little much IMO, especially as it's free to IOS users(with one team to play), the DLC is also over priced in my opinion, but I got this on sale for 0.99 and should've gotten the extra teams too, but I didn't(wasn't thinking and kinda broke).

Its hard to really get into it when you want to sit down and play it for more than 10 minutes. They should have added some kind of campaign for the PC release. The other paid classes seem to be unbalanced with the original free class as well. You wont run into very many people with those classes but if you do you might as well quit.

I've seen reviews giving it a thumbs down after only 10 or so hours of gameplay saying that it has no depth...they are very mistaken. This is a game that is quite easy to start playing, still quite easy to become rather good at but there are always another level of strategy for you to explore. This is the kind of game where you can't do it all by math and you can't do it all by gut feeling, you have to have a combination of both to be a successful player. Weigh your aggression with your analytic skills and you'll soon be a worthy opponent.Something that I do feel is annoying is that you have to buy the different teams one by one, but on the other hand you can pick the game up for free for your android or ios pad or phone with one of the teams available and the games constantly comes up for sales. You don't need to have many teams to become a good player or enjoy the game.The different teams are very different from eachother but still very balanced. There are some combinations where you feel that one of the teams have an advantage but you don't know what team the other guy is going to choose so you can't really plan for that.All in all, this game is worth your time if you want a relaxing game that require you to think while playing rather than react to what is blinking on the screen."

The object is to destroy either the enemy team, or their two crystals which generally spawn fairly close to the unit spawn tiles.  Each race has different funtions, the Orcs seem to excell at causing large ammounts of damage with combat units but don't have many damaging ability cards, whereas the Team Fortress team relies on using support units to buff the damage dealing units.All in all the base game at $5 is well worth it, the DLC expansion races seem a little high in price to me, but once they drop to 50% off I'll definitely be grabbing them."

It's a flash based game which you play with iOS gamers, which means the community is softcore.  You can expect to play a couple of not very fun turns before your trash opponent loses interest and wanders off.  If you start wining forget about it.  Worse you can't set up any turn rules to force the oponent to play.  I've finished play by mail campaigns faster than I got through my first battle in this game.  The only positive is that the gameplay is tedious enough that you won't care when your opponent quits part way through."

It's online player verus player only, with no skirmish mode, and I hate that.  Buying it on steam gives you access to two teams, the humans and the Team Fortress 2 team, but there are three others.  Just pray you don't get matched against someone who's paid to unlock the dark elves, you'll lose.That's part of the problem with the game, the racial abilities for some teams are radically overpowered.  Teamfortress2 team has the ability to gain an extra move every time they 'kill' a unit by stomping.  Since each round has 5 moves, adding a 6th is pretty huge.   But the dark elves ability to heal EVERY TIME THEY DO DAMAGE is ridiculously overpowered.  I have played over 30 games so far and I haven't been able to beat the dark elves even once.For $5, if you like strategy games like this, it's definitly fun.  Maybe if you buy the 2 pack and play with a friend, it would be better."
