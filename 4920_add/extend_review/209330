,Not Recommended,209330,9368243,"Posted: 6 March, 2014",all,PFC Hauger [29ID],"Greetings, comrades! I really, REALLY wanted to like this game. I mean, who wouldn't? A randomly generated ""Metroid-vania"" style game with RPG-heavy gameplay, what more could you want? Well, the answer lies below, if you dare to enter the rabbit hole.Pros:As I already stated, the concept is amazing, and the RPG elements are simple yet complete. Unlike most RPGs, this one gives you a very strong weapon right off the bat. Not the best, but good enough to be a constant companion throughout the game.I found the graphics to be a refreshing change from the standard ""drab-&-dull"" that older Indie games are known for (not all Indie games, calm down fan-people). The world is bright and sharp, with clean angles and stunning detail.The custom difficulty is nice, allowing you to set your own pace.The controls, while a bit quirky, are responsive and imaginative.Cons:While the RPG elements are all there, there really isn't a temptation to level up. I mean, my character could ""tank"" all of the early bosses with ease, the only challenge being when a boss is resistant to a certain elemental-type weapon, and you have to use another element to kill it. Even then, the challenge rests not in the boss itself, but rather in finding the new element required to kill it.While I like quick weapon progression, as it allows you to do other stuff instead of trying to get a new weapon, this game suffers from a lack of other stuff to do. The quests are the same, the enemies are the same, the graphics are the same, and the gameplay style is the same. All the same. All the same. Did I ever tell you the definition of insanity? (Heh, see what I did there? Ha ha! No? Ah, forget it.)As I said, the world is very realistic, but the characters are not. It's almost like playing one of those old CD drive games in which the people look like cut-outs pasted onto a background. This is actually a fatal flaw, as it throws off jumping in an odd way. It makes you unsure of what is in the background, or what you can jump on. I really can't describe it, but if you play it, you should see what I mean.I really hate to say it, but this game's lack of creativity and excess of imagination bring this game down from the heights it could have achieved. It's almost like they were so focused on the imaginative idea of the game that they forgot to flesh it out into something workable. Plenty of people like the game, and I can see why, however I just couldn't bring myself to do the same.Thanks for reading and have an awesome day!"

The combination of randomly-generated levels and metroidvania-style platforming gives it a great deal of replayability. Something that I find interesting, however, is the game's emotional impact. While the game's story isn't particularily impressive, the combination of easily-learned gameplay, beautiful graphics, and incredibly memoriable music give a profound sense of solitude and loneliness. As a Glyphbearer, you are one of the only people in the now-shattered world who can survive outside the scant few villages spread across the continents, and the loneliness and sense of hopelessness that accompany sich a role are palpable. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, though. Personally, the mood of the game feels very quiet and reserved. Unlike many other games, A Valley Without Wind truly gives the feeling of being a wanderer, passing through dead towns and snowy forests with nowhere to truly call home.  If you're familiar with the concept of Catharsis, then this game is a brilliant example of it in action. The game provides a memoriable experience that I have never found in any other game, and I would heartily reccomend it."

A mashup of numerous ideas, art styles, and gameplay mechanics.Let's start with the first and most easily noticed one, the look of the game. It's fairly inconsistant. This is compounded by the gameplay, too. At times it's trying to be Terraria where you're gathering resources like wood to make platforms, at others it's trying to be Diablo with a Mana Pool for spells and skills and exploring buildings you come across. There's blocky, almost placebo-esque objects, but they're mixed in with lumpy, mishapen boulders.. slender trees.. and even animated portals.You start off with four randomly generated and barely customizable characters, and there's a very limited number of character designs to boot. This means when Sykdemo Thargbiscuit dies, there's a very good chance that Archibald Roundabout will take their place and look exactly the same. Except their stats may be slighty different, and depending on how far you were before you died, a lot worse. This also means you may have to go from playing a ranged mage to a melee meathead with little say in the matter.Unlike, say, Rogue Legacy which does this with a charming upgrade system and consistant, yet progressive stats, A Valley Without Wind just kinda.. well, tosses the player into the wind. Oh, and you'll die a lot, to be sure. If not from actual mobs (which is very likely as you have no clue what you're doing, and the User Interface is clunky and unhelpful), then you're sure to die of boredom as you repeat the same handful of tasks over and over again.I got the game ages ago as part of a bundle because I thought it'd be a fun Metroidvania sort of title, and at first glance it definitely seemed like it might be. Unfortunately, the other thing AVWW reeks of is the feeling that it's unfinished. It's pretty clear the developers got partway through progress of making the game, given it's bizarre title screen which features ""asking for your key"", a blurb about the aforementioned progress which hasn't updated in forever, and a scrolling storyline summary which is about as much as I ever got for plot.Even free it didn't feel worth it. I just hope the bundle came with other games I actually enjoyed, but it was so long ago I have no idea anymore. I can definitely tell you that unless the sequel is made out of ♥♥♥♥♥♥s and maybe chocolate, it probably isn't worth the $15 it's currently sitting at, either.As an aside, I've read that there is eventually city building. Sadly, the game just couldn't keep my interest long enough to actually make it that far. From what I understand from a friend who has played it, and a few other reviews.. you don't get the sense of progression you ought to in a game like this. Once you ""complete"" an island with rebuilding, bosses, and so forth, you just go off and repeat it and this happens ad nauseum. Given how the general gameplay was so unpolished, I can't imagine the rebuilding stage of it to be any better."

It mocks you a little bit for going into caves without much in them and suggests that you made a mistake going in them.If you're like me, this isn't going to stop you either way, but there is a good reason for why the game does this and I will elaborate on why.I started playing this game again the other day after a 3 year break. I did the tutorial, messed around in my settlement and decided to go and do my very first mission. There was a grid square with a mission very close by on the world map so that's where I headed.The area where the mission start was located had a cave connected to it which I decided to check out, on the off chance that I could nab some resources before doing the mission. This cave ended up being massive, and I went into every. Single. Room. The game gives you a rough idea on what kinds of things you can find in each room by simply hovering over the dungeon map but I didn't care, I thought I'd explore the cave and move on.Here's the kicker, this cave had 3 sub-dungeons in it. All of them put together made up about the same room space as the entirety of the cave itself. Furthermore, at the lowest point of the cave was a passage into a LOWER cave, which housed higher level enemies.I wasn't too sure about going lower but I did it anyway. This cave was about half the size of the previous one, but it ALSO  housed another lower passage. The lower passage seemed smaller still, but at this point Level 3 enemies were far from merciful to me and I decided to back out. Not without noticing however, that there was another passage to a lower cave that I could take. This doesn't account of course for any sub-dungeons that could exist in the Level 3/4 cave, since I didn't explore that far.In total, my venture in this cave and its sub dungeons took almost two hours. Once I finally scrambled my way out of it, I started the mission. That took just 4 minutes.I like this game."

It has some fun elements, things I usually enjoy in games, such as random loot, directed character development, and procedurally generated levels. Problem is, it's wrapped in a package that obscures it all, and a control scheme that's clunky at best, maddeningly frusrating at worst. I never felt as though I had complete control over my actions due to this. The art style isn't my taste, and seems a bit hodge-podge. Sounds are nice and satisfying for the most part. You might find some entertainment here if you can get past the control scheme and visuals, but I'd recommend spending your money elsewhere."

The game's marketing cites a level of depth and challenge that is absent. Enemies have simple patterns that are easily exploited. I killed half the bosses while they were offscreen. Player customization is nice but isn't anything new or unique. Platforming is made completely trivial by the ability to place platforms anywhere.Visually the game is unclear, muddy, and unattractive. Characters are stiltedly animated. Enemies, pickups, background objects, and projectiles all look similar and the only way to differentiate them is by what color they are on the minimap.The game's music is decent, with a nice main menu theme. The sound effects are inoffensive.The whole time there is this feeling that ""it gets better later"". Maybe it does. But it starts terribly and doesn't get any better after 4 hours."

It is kind of complicated but doesn't take too long to figure out (plus there are some good wikis for it.) also buying the first game gets you the second game for free.  The biggest problem with this game though is the graphics and art work are really really cheesy.  Movement on guys looks like the first episode of south park.  I wasn't too phased by the graphics, but most of the really low reviews the game got were because of it.

For graphics, a solid ""meh"".As a developer, if I put a program like this together, it would honestly be as an experiment, not as a release. However, it would be a successful experiment. The game procedurally generates everything, and well; it shows the power of sandbox environments that don't rely directly on player input. However, the AI is pretty clunky and the graphics are just blocky, so if you're overly concerned about that, I would skip this one or buy its sequel instead (which largely fixed the graphics issue).Generally I enjoy this game.

Although I have enjoyed the game for many hours it's mainly to finish up some achievements. The game starts off as a confusing mess but it becomes enjoyable once you've figured out how to play it.  However, playing it involves a lot of grinding. Grinding for money, grinding for survivors, grinding for buoys and windmills, grinding for trinkets to make survivors happy, etc....I personally found the game much more enjoyable in the easiest settings. That way I didn't have to worry about babysitting the survivors and their dispositions for missions. Fall damage is significantly reduced and you will fall a lot!  Money is still fairly tight so there's no getting away from grinding to find  missions that drop the rewards you need.Still, I've often found myself enjoying the game so much that I play for a couple of hours at a time trying to reach the next continent.   However, after fifteen continents and no new gameplay mechanics or biomes, the game has becomes incredibly repetitive -  kill the lieutenants, kill the overlord, find/buy buoys or windmills as needed and move to the next continent.There's barely any difference in the gameplay when your character is Level 80 versus Level 20.  All the continents start to look the same and the biomes are identical to each other, there's nothing new and little reason to keep playing.....except for those last few achievements."

So instead of a great game that can be played endlessly we get a game that's good for a while but runs out of steam once you've seen everything it has to offer. The tragedy is that it was clearly aiming to be played endlessly with it's endless ocean and bottomless caves, and people clearly put a lot of work into creating a wide variety of weapons, enemies, and mini-games, but they were putting their effort in the wrong direction.When exploration is done right in a game, it can keep you busy for as long as you care to spend exploring. In principle it's not complicated to do it right. Just look at Minecraft or Terraria and do something like that; give people a huge and varied world, scatter prizes around like Easter eggs, and let people wander. The hard part is generating the world. It seems that A Valley Without Wind wanted to be an exploration game, but couldn't figure out how to generate a world so they took a shortcut and generated a endless web of interconnected rooms instead. They worked so hard to build a good game around that web of rooms and they succeeded, but it's still no substitute for an actual explorable world.The saddest thing of all is when this game shoots itself in the foot because of its own good intentions. They have a map, but the web of rooms is too complicated to represent literally on a flat map, so you get an abstract view that shows only the connections and doesn't show relative positions or sizes. The game explains this very carefully because it could easily be confusing. They explain that to represent the rooms with size and relative position you would need a 3D map, which would be difficult to read, which is very true. The map they give is very easy to read and an excellent tool for figuring out where you are and where you want to go. It's so good that it shows you explicitly the real truth of what you are doing. You're not exploring a cave or a dungeon; you're exploring a graph, a set of nodes connected by edges. The rooms aren't parts of a larger building; they are just mini platforming challenges that you overcome to get to the next room, and the map makes this so very obvious.I usually find myself wanting to get through a room rather than wanting to explore it. Why explore a room when I know it's just a meaningless node in a graph that I will never have reason to return to? No room has anything that I can't find somewhere else. As soon as you find yourself skipping rooms that you know won't lead anywhere instead of going in to every room just for the fun of it, you've realized that this game is not an exploration game.There is no RPG in this game and there is no strategy. The exploration is very week. It may be technically a sandbox, but it's a sandbox where all you can do is run, jump, and shoot. What is good in this game is pure platformer with mouse-aimed shooting, and it's strength is in the wide variety of weapons and enemies. It also has tons of stuff to collect and several mini-games where you have do to things like get down a long hallway of monsters without taking damage or protect a village from a meteor storm by knocking the meteors off coarse.This game is probably worth its price, but that's hard to judge. You might be best to wait for a sale. It's not one of those priceless games that you'll keep playing forever. It should be very entertaining for quite a few hours, but once you've done everything you're going to want to stop. The game won't tell you when to stop since it is endless, so eventually you'll stop because you've stopped finding new things and you're bored, but that doesn't mean it wasn't really fun in the beginning."
,Recommended,209330,11802526,"Posted: 20 August, 2014",all,AsuraBlade,"An excellent game once you get in there and really dig into the game's many mechanics. Lots to explore, fight and build. The graphics are generic looking, yet crisp and clear at the same time. The game is polished for the most part and the general controls are good, controller support is definitely a plus for a Metroidvania game such as this (and customizable support at that). The soundtrack is one of the best game soundtracks I've heard in recent years with lots of the tracks occasionally getting stuck in your head. As for the in-game mechanics, there are A LOT of them surprisingly for a game in the Metroidvania genre. It's highly frustrating at first having all these mechanics thrown in your face (crafting, building, etc.) and with a literally endless world to explore (you simply will never completely explore your world, it's that large). Yet once you get a grasp of them (took me a long while), they all turn out to be welcome additions to a game with otherwise simple core gameplay.A big one for me is modding. You can do everything from literally changing the character sprites themselves, to designing your own levels and so on. Although, unfortunately the modding community never really hit it off, so there isn't much pre-made mods to choose from. Yet if your like me and your fine with making your own, then your golden.In short, this is basically one of those games where either your the kind of gamer who just wants to sit down and enjoy a game, and that's it. Else your the kind of gamer who doesn't mind doing a little work to really learn a game. So if your part of the latter who likes to learn, experiment and most importantly loves Metroidvania-style gameplay, then definitely pick this game up. Highly recommended."

Yet, even though all of these elements don't blend together into a focused gameplay experience, I would say AVWW is greater than the sum of its parts. It's a game best played when you don't want massive amounts of stimulation or tough decisions to make. It's slow. Peaceful. Bizarre. Simple. Deep. Calming. Additting. Demanding. and totally hands off at the same time.Serveral points:Graphics:For many people this ruins the game for them. While I do acknowledge the stiff animations and strange blend of styles I find thay they add to the game more than it distracts from it. This uniquely strange artstyle helps instill the player with the game's mood- mystery and wonder. The setting of the game takes place in a fractured reality where all times and places converge (think Land of the Lost 2009) the juxtaposed visuals help with this suspension of disbelief.My one complant with the graphics is that some of the backgrounds in indoor areas don't mesh well with the indoor patforms, causing confusion.Music: Arcen Games always has good music and this game is no exception.Gameplay:Platforming- Excellent controls and physics make jumping around a joy and an ease.Combat- It's repeatitive yet satisfing. There are many different missions which help shake things up a bit.Exploration- Strangely mystical... The proceedurally generated worlds seem souless yet full of mystery, terror, and quiet beauty at the same time. It reminds me of playing Dwarf Fortress survival mode.Progression- In my eyes, this game is less of a Metriodvania as it is a Dungeon Crawl. It's as if Diablo or Fate had a child with a proceedurally generated Metriod. It is satisfing to level up and improve one's inventory in this game.Final WordsI disagree with the assertion that AVWW is an experiment gone wrong. It's an unpolished gem, sure. Yet its beauty comes with its strange lumps and bumps. It's polished, but not for an museum or a lab.I'll be coming back to AVWW from time to time to feed my imagination, but also to feed my desire to float above a pack of velociraptors in ancient Egypt on a carpet of air bubbles whilst bombarding them with boulders and summoned rhinoceroses."

AVWW is almost like several games that I love, it is a little Metroid like, a little Castlevania like, a little Terraria like, and a little (very little) Shining Force EXA like. The controls are a bit awkward at first (do not even bother with attempting to use a controler even though the game is technicaly compatible with one) and there is a very steep learning curve.  Just understanding how to efficiently and properly use the warps located in the game, and to fully understand the map took me several hours of play.  Tutorial boxes do pop up but they are not even close to adequate in their explanations.  Case and point in order to make my life easier when I started the game I felt the need to create my own manual cut together from bits and pieces I could find on their web page.  By the time I was done it was nearly 50 PAGES LONG I KID YOU NOT!  Once you understand the mechanics and how to best do what you need to do you can have fun with it, but it is very rarely satisfying.You could easily spend hours looking for one particular item to do one particular thing, and that thing almost never feels like a true reward for your efforts.  Hard earned spells need to be replaced near constantly as your world gains levels, and you need a huge (really huge, you have near zero control over this) bit of luck to aquire the spells you want with decent modifiers.  Again as soon as the world levels up your previous spells that you worked so hard to get are one step closer to obsolete, and the process repeats itself.  The other issue I take with the luck factor in the game is that a huge number of the achievments come down to just dumb, blind luck.  I am refering to a set of at least 15 or so goals that are simply ""get a legendary this,"" followed by another ""get a legendary that,"" then ""get a legendary one of those.""  The only way to get a legendary anything (as far as the enchants the acivement wants goes) is by sheer luck.  the only control you have over this is in leveling up your world via defeating certain ""luitenants."" I have heard tell that the higher level your word is the better chance you have of getting legenary things, but this like so many other parts of this game, is not clearly explained or stated anywhere so I am not 100% on this and could be mistaken.  Even if that is the case though that only gives you some controll over the legendary part of the requirement and not the item part of the requirement so you could easily just keep getting a ""Legendary not what you needed"" over and over and over...and over and over...and over.The last issue I take with AVWW is that it just goes on forever, like litteraly...forever.  Some people may see this as a plus and to them I say ""go you, purchase this game ASAP,"" but I am a person who likes a degree of finality in my games, and this unfortunately doesn't have any.  After several hours of play I found myself asking why am I still playing this? If I beat this continent I am just going to do the same exact thing on the next one, then the next one, then the next one, etc. etc. and none of them change enough to make you feel like you are truly progessing, it feels more like you are stuck in the gaming equivalent of Groundhog Day.Play this game if you like: Randomly generated maps and dungeons, hack n' slash style gameplay, games that you can put 1000's of hours into.Don't play this game if you like: Truly finishing a game, being a completionist, power leveling, milestones, a high degree of control over your equipment and spells."

There is plenty of more content like better items and spells and also enemies on the next continents but i think that is it for me now.

It has a nonlinear plot, an infinite number of worlds, a complex magic system, and dynamic enemies. Highly recommended to anyone who likes platformers, and retrogamers in particular."

The shortest, and yet unjust, description is that it's a Metroidvania with strategy, RPG, and action elements. A damn deep and complex one.You're dropped in a massive world, given a few points on the map that represent bosses, and have to get ready to go tackle them. You build buildings that buff you. you gather components to write spells, and you gather gear. When you feel buff and badass, you go kill a boss, and everything gets harder. With each boss, more stuff to do is introduced, and you learn more about the story.Most of AVWW is exploration. You enter a landmark on the map and begin exploring, looking for loot to make you more powerful. Completionists will go insane: you have to identify what's worth your time exploring and what's not. In that way the experience is clean and streamlined. You see on your map a room that has stuff worth your time in it and go; otherwise you move on.All in all, damn addictive and engagin"

,Recommended,209330,4000153,"Posted: 14 January, 2013",all,Some Guy,"Procedurally generated platformer with loadsa projectiles. Lots of emphasis on free roaming and item collecting. Pretty easy to load up on powerful spells and become a virtual god, but the second continent will kick your♥♥♥♥♥♥with no mercy. Pretty solid in that it makes you feel in control of your character and customizationThe game is pretty obtuse in a lot of its mechanics, relying on a giant in game encyclopedia to give most of its info as to how the game works, although there is a tutorial that invovles some mechanics. There is also a heavy, HEAVY emphasis on using the minimaps, which sometimes subtracts from the experience of platforming. WIthout extensive use of them, you will find yourself going to pointless areas all the time.Overall, a good platformer with a steep learning curve and potentially a lot of replay value"

Part hybrid RPG, part Castlevania SoN, part Super Marior World, part Metroid, part Contra, and part every other cool side scrolling game you have ever played from the 90's.  It doesn't look like much, but damn.  WHAT A GAME!!!  I have not had this much fun playing a side scroll since Metroid was remade on the SNES.  Very well worth your $14.99."

This game has the graphics and enemies of a web browser game, and a sound track thats worse than listening to celine dions ""I will always love you"" titanic song for 50 hours straight.  I would rather get food poisoning than buy this game again.  I was expecting so much from this game after reading the reviews.  Im a sucker for buying this game.  WORST DECISION EVER!"
