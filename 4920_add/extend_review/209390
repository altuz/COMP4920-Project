IF SOMEBODY GIVES YOU A COPY, IT STILL ISN'T WORTH IT!The main problem with this game is that it is a multi-player only game with dead servers. Which means that people paid money to sit in a lobby waiting for somebody to show up. They never do. Save your money and buy Blood Bowl instead, a game with a solid single-player mode AND a healthy multiplayer community.Add into the mix how many teams have been cut out just so they can be sold back to you at a stupid rate, and you have the worst purchase ever on SteamEDIT: This review was written before the ""Knockout"" edition came out ""too little, too late""I haven't seen the new version because the DRM only allows limited downloads, and since I replaced my PC I've not been able to activate it. Take from that what you will."

I will admit I am glad they got rid of the outrageous dlc and added some ai, but the has changed very little.  The single player is shallow with only allowing the player to choose pre-selected teams with no team custimization of any kind.  The multiplayer online for all intensive purposes is still dead, and the online ai teams kinda break the whole purpose of online multiplayer.  Glad it changed but still not worth it."

Purchasing it I was initially impressed with the game play but frustrated with the difficulties in finding an opponent.  I made teams to match my tabletop ones which won consistently but here this was not the case.  I pressed on assuming that I did not have the skill and it took me time to get used to the interface.  I eventually realized that my gameplay had little to do with it: the rules were subtlety different and at times broken, such as game duration limit and no blitzing off a teleport.  The final blow for me was the Dwarven Deathroller which in my opinion is so broken that I have caught myself swearing at my monitor at least forty times.  All other ""big guys"" have a detriment skill like take root, really dumb, etc. but not this beast.  I calculated that teams I played against that did not have a Deathroller, I won >65% of games while if they did have one, I would win less than 20% of the time.Why not make a team with a Deathroller, Trou?  My answer: why not make a game that is at least reasonably balanced?I am able to look passed a lot of this game's flaws that are stated here in these accurate reviews but combined together with this diarrhea on top, I would not recommend this game even if you love the table top version like I do.Jepumk said it best: it is a poorly realized version of the table top game."

As a fan of the Bloodbowl Game, I thought this couldn't be too bad despite the the negative reviews, right?  I won't regurgitate the comments already posted in the negative reviews, but I will add that once installed, it will not uninstall correctly, just launches the game every time you try to delete local content."

It lacks polish. It lacks flair. It lacks a decent AI, UI and single player campaign. Seeing how the campaign works in regular BB, I don't see why Cyanide couldn't let the player make a single player team. Instead you can only play offline with premade teams. Kinda missed the mark, by a mile or two..."

76561198027196791,Not Recommended,209390,30107889,Posted: 22 February,all,IM Yuzu,Got this on sale so I figured it would at least be worth the sale price but I was wrong. It takes about 10 minutes to load even the smallest match and then the AI just stopped working halfway through the match. Had to just sit and wait for it to run out of time each turn... so broken.So sad this has so much potential to be a faster paced take on BB.

ONE: You can play mixed race teams base on which college you choose. TWO: I also like the level editor to make custom playing fields. Unfortunately no one to play against except the CPU.

What really grated me was the misleading comment about playing against the computer ai.  That is total bulls**t.  The only option to playing against the ai is a lame exhibition mode, unlike the bloodbowl series where you have proper single player campaigns.Don't waste your money on this one."

Lots of Fun when you can find a match wich is almost never.realisticaly dungeonbowl should be a game option included in the more popular blood bowl games and not a stand alone game on its own. so unfortunately as much as i actualy like this game i cannot continue to recomend it.
