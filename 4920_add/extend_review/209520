There is also an ingame editor linked to the Steam Workshop to create, share and download other tracks which is very simple to do.While enjoyable to zip around the tracks and drift around corners, the AI opposition rarely put up any challenge at all (the exception being a couple of maps where you could do with a speed upgrade, that is easily passed the moment you have acquired it or a higher top speed vehicle). It also appears the AI Drivers have been drinking...while it's nice that they don't always perform the perfect lap, they will frequently slam into corners or boost directly into a wall.The physics in the game can cause frustration, as you slap to a halt after performing a jump or snag on a slightly uphill piece of track.  There is also an oddity that before a race gets underway you get a glimpse of the tablet UI for the game, but that doesn't impact the experience in any meaningful way.At the time of writing, there were no active multiplayer servers.It's very hard to recommend Mini Motor Racing EVO except for the extremely casual gamer who's unfamiliar with racing titles and just wants a little fun zipping around a track."
,Recommended,209520,9916078,"Posted: 23 April, 2014",all,Raphael,"This is a cute little racer, reminiscent of the Amiga racer All Terrain Racing, that will hit both your pleasure and frustration buttons.  The two major frustrating elements are the collisions that almost always favour the AI racers, and also the lack of progress syncing in between races.  You'd better quit and restart on your own every few races to save your races and your money, because a game or a system crash will obliterate any progress from that session.As for the game itself, it is a satisfying combination of good driving, tactics, and upgrades that will see you to the finish line.  You'll need more than just a couple of afternoons to make it to the end, and every time you make it past that one difficult course, it feels just great.  A worthwhile purchase if you like small, classic racers."

This game makes pretty much every mistake an arcade racer can make. The first couple of races are just fine, but later on the issues this game has start ruining it to such an extend it is no longer fun to play.The AI: Probably the biggest issue. They are not on the track to win. They are there to make sure you don't win. Without hesitation they will boost into you from every possible angle in order to slow you down or flip you over. When the best strategy in a racing game involves restarting the race so many times until you manage to make a clean getaway instead of actually racing your opponents, you know things are not as they should be.Wonky car handling: It's an arcade racer, so realistic car handling is not to be expected. But the cars in this game behave very vague and inconsistent, making for a very frustrating experience. Good examples of the weird car physics are slopes or ramps. You can drive onto them in the exact same spot for 5 laps and everything's just fine and on lap 6 it suddenly spins your car around on the spot and brings you to a dead stop (after which 9 times out of 10 an AI boosts into you to finish the job). And don't even think about driving off or onto a slope while steering as it will make you spin out of control instantly.Invisible objects: A lot of the tracks are plagued with invisible objects and walls on the corners. In some corners the cars can pretty much clip through objects without issue, and on other corners you find yourself smashing into an invisible wall that is sticking out into the track.Prize money too low: With the very low amounts of prize money you get, it becomes a real grind in order to fully upgrade a 2nd, let alone a 3rd car. And you absolutely want multiple cars in the later cups in order to use their individual strengths and weaknesses for different tracks.It's a shame really, as the general design of this game is very good. Graphics, track design, music and car design are all very nicely done, but it's the actual gameplay that ruins it. If you're looking for a good micro machines-style racer, then look at Bang Bang Racing instead. While that game also has it's issues it is much more enjoyable then this one."

Because it looks cute and is fun occasionally, when you manage to take lead. But.. physics are just outrages. Your car bumps on many invisible bumps on the road. If you improve handling it starts making circles if you turn a little bit harder. You can make you car fast and leap far ahead, but then you will chase the last ones and they will DEVASTATE you and make you lose the race. Yes, AI is stupidly aggressive, just going straight ahead to kill you, no matter what, on turns on long straights, etc."

The AI drivers behave like they're alone on track, constantly bumping into each other and the player. And as if that's not enough the smallest collisions slow you down to a crawl, spin your car around and thus make you vulnerable for yet more AI drivers to crash into you, repeating the cycle. But if you manage to get a good start and survive the first 10 seconds the AI drivers will take each other out every too often and it's too easy to drive home a win. Unless you get screwed by lapped cars, of which there are way too many for these small grids and 1-2 minute races.A lot of good games lack the polish. This nicely polished game lacks functioning game mechanics.Don't buy this game!"
,Not Recommended,209520,22065231,"Posted: 26 March, 2016",all,stubar,"It pains me to say this but I'm not going to recommend Mini Motor Racing EVO basically down to the game having really bad physics.  Most of my play time was spent racing with a friend in 1v1 races which were generally decided by how the physics treated the player.  In some occasions a vehicle could get flipped on its side seemingly randomly and on a lot  of occasions an agressive side-swipe at my opponent would leave me in a worse off situation than him!  There seemed to be no realism or accuracy in the physics therefore removing any type of skill factor in the driving and racing.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PBu8tufUp4Now the game looks really nice and fun.  It almost seems criminal to me to make a top-down racing game appear so nice and colorful to look at but then get let down by such a major game-breaking factor!There's a large array of cars to choose from and an even more impressive track selection with day and night variants.  I learned today that the game also has Steam Workshop for creating and sharing your own track designs!!You have an option of two different systems to control your vehicle.  The first type is the more conventional method of rotate/steer the car clockwise/anti-clockwise and the second type is to push in the direction you want to travel.  Now the second method of pusing in the desired direction of travel sounds awful to me but I actually found it a more efficient way to play this game.  You still have to accelerate and brake the same with both methods.  It's worth testing them both out with an open mind and seeing which works best for you.There is no local co-op feature but the online multiplayer works fine.  I'm not sure about the playerbase but I managed to find my steam friend to play with without any problems and our games ran smoothly.So many positive points about this game let down by a lack of fine-tuning in the physics.  The game boasts ""cross-platform multiplayer"" so possibly the physics were acceptable on a mobile platform.  I think on the PC platform we expect a bit more from our game.If you can put up with the clunky physics and have a friend or three to play with then you could have some fun for sure.  For me though, it removed almost all competiveness and thus removed the fun and motivation to race further."

Restart until you get lucky enough for those idiots to crash into each other instead of you. That works well until you start to lap them and they all try to sabotage you. Feels more like a 1v5 race instead of a 6 person race.2. Repetitive maps. They re-use the same maps over and over, putting different spins on them (race backwards! now race at night!) and some of the camera angles cause you to completely not be able to see your car. Here's the #1 thing I want from a racing game: TO BE ABLE TO SEE MY CAR3. A bunch of cars with little difference between them. Just take the starting car and use it until you unlock the car you get for finishing the beginner cup and then upgrade that and you win the game.On the bright side, it has some cool TF2 and Portal 2 levels and it has Workshop support. I can't help but to think the Workshop support is just there because the developers didn't feel like making many tracks of their own."

The difficulty is insane. This certainly ain't a game for the kiddies, I'll tell ya' that now. There are two problems that factor in together for this.The first is that the physics are very aggravating at times. It is borderline inconceivable to maintain any sort of speed when attempting to corner. You will either end up having to slow down to a crawl or letting off the acceleration for a brief second and doing subtle taps in order to turn but that still annihiliates your speed. It may be easier with an analog control such as a joystick, wheel or a game pad but I haven't tried this.The second is that the AI opponents are EXTREMELY brutal and relentless. They WILL shunt you at any opportunity they get and you WILL eventually get spun out and there is nothing you can do. Simple as that. If you do get spun out, you lose, good luck catching up afterwards. Get used to it. You could still try by saving your nitros but I wouldn't count on it.This game is actually quite a lot of fun but you'd either have to be extremely lucky, have a lot of patience or just like losing races every now and then in order to enjoy this. For a game that you would play for about 20 minutes each time, it shouldn't be this difficult."

The cars themselves are cute and some of the paint schemes and models are references to pop culture (like the Scooby van and DeLorean look-alikes).The level editor is ultimately disappointing, because you can only buld flat tracks.

You can make good races against faster cars on harder cups - if you are a good driver -  later buying upgrades ensures that you will eventualy start to catch up AI opponents if you dont make it in the races with a inferior car.. i.e. the game is tilted in the beginning so that your car is slow but as you become beter driver and get more upgrades you start to own the opposition one way or the other. 'No driver left behind' -policy i guess you can call it. :)d) related to part c. there will always be a challenge left for you. tons of races and cups and AI will (literaly) push you hard around.And should you think that races get too easy? well you can switch the car but the catch is that upgrades are always tied to certain cars so if you want something else or unlock a new car then you need to start over.

Unfortunately, looks can be deceiving.Also, despite my low hours I did complete this game. Its very short.Gameplay:The biggest flaw with this game is the gameplay. Its not particularly bad. Its just incredibly dull. The level layouts aren't interesting and not much of anything happens throughout the races.Its not really bad, its just boring and almost a drag to play through. This isn't me disliking this style of racing games either as I've played others that were much better.Another issue I have with the game is while there are plenty of cars to choose from, some of them are much better than others. I found myself having to play with vehicles I didn't like in order to win the races. You also need to keep upgrading them constantly which can be a bit obnoxious.By the time I finished the game I had no real desire to ever touch it again.Story, Visuals, & Music:The game looks pretty decent. Some of the levels have interesting themes so I can't complain much about that. The music was okay. It was mixed well enough to sound professional, but the tracks were incredibly lacking in terms of the compositions. Nothing stood out at all - it was just a bunch of dull backing tracks basically.PC Version:I don't recall any issues with how the game ran itself.Conclusion:Its really not a bad game, but its uninteresting and a bore to play.If online multiplayer isn't very important to you and you want to play a game like this, check out Bang Bang Racing.It may not have as much flashy features, but its actually a fun game.Give that one go. As for Mini Motor Racing EVO? Pass."

It has repetitive maps, bad AI, also, the game gets boring very quickly and it has ZERO replay value.  The developers could of added more achievements to this game. For example Finish first by being ahead on every lap or dead last as another achievement. There is no multiplayer for this game. No one is ever online. The only positives about this game is that the graphics are nice and that the achievements are all attainable,  Otherwise if you like being tortured playing this game I strongly do not recommend it.4.5/10"

It doesn't feel like a micromachines / childhood mini cars experience. I rushed to buy the game but then I was dissapointed (there were no steam refunds at the time, 2013).I have had controller issues since day one. Have tried with different controllers and all of them feels different, work or don't and have to configure them every time. Even when controls are mapped, the game plays awful. Physics will make sure you get in the last place. Forget about using turbo, you'll ruin your hard earned place. If you manage to be in 1st place for the first 15 seconds then you have a chance of winning the race but if your opponent is 10 seconds away from you in a better place then just restart the race, it is impossible to catch up.I did however managed to run the game when I recently purchased it with one controller (it worked and felt really well) and this is when I could play the game (and used to recommend it as a casual racer) but very little time then the controller died on me and had to rely on mouse or keyboard (mouse is the best alternative so far but keyboard is too laggy). I've been struggling with the game ever since, trying different controllers every now and then but none of them seem to work like the first one, maybe it is the latest patch that brought like a new controller backend but instead it messed it up.The level editor is really good though, have spent many hours building custom tracks.In conclusion, it is a good casual racing game if you are tolerant to frustration but it is not a game for you if you do not like to lose."

Then you get the whole Nitro mechanic that can make or break a race if you know when and where to fire one of those off.Second, the graphics are actually quite good, with reflections, dynamic lights and some nice textures for the most part. Some tracks look damn nifty.The tracks combine fun themes, good looks, and good racing gamplay which is pretty much the holy grail. Around 20 tracks with day/night variants as well as backwards/forwards runs. Got a good mix of real fast, short tracks and some longer ones where skillful steering adds up. Really are some pretty cool and fun tracks like Turnpike, Cliffs, Fortress, Aperture Labs, Alpine and Downtown - my favs.I do have to say that'd I'd appreciate some more loooonger tracks as well as off road ones. Think Turnpike but with mud puddles, ramps... like WARIOS STADIUM from Mario Kart 64, hahaThe cars are simple in appearance but that more or less fits the game - not super silly but not realistic either. Cars have 4 stats that you can upgrade and each car has a different distribution when fully maxed out so they perform differently as well. Some might have really high top speed and nitros but lack in the handleing and acceleration department as an example.Multiplayer works well as I've played a good 40 races that were smooth and fun. There are a few kinks to work out but an actual Developer was racing with us from time to time and he said there was gonna be a patch soon that'll help smooth a lot of it out. Could use a few more features like a 5-6 track points tally game where after the cup is over the player with the most points wins, though.All in all defs worth the 8 bucks I paid for it!"

I've lost track of how many times I had to restart a race due to a single pileup being the difference between first and last.Some might call it part of the game, but it just makes me want to throw my controller through the monitor."

,Recommended,209520,29784401,Posted: 8 February,all,Eloines ʕ•ᴥ•ʔ,"It's just an awesome little game. I played it on Android for a while before I found it on Steam. All normal cars are unlocked from the beginning as opposed to having to buy like the mobile app. There are still unlockable cars for completing each championship and there are some cross overs with TF2 & Portal and Fruit Ninja by Halfbrick.What I like the most is how car upgrades make a noticeable difference in performance. I would strongly suggest sticking with one or two cars that match your driving style. One for the beginner championship and about halfway intermediate, and a better one for Expert and Master. At least for me that's all I needed. The $16,000 upgrades are worth it, trust me.One of the downsides to this game is that the AI doesn't actually get ""tougher"" with higher difficulties. They are significantly faster, but that's it. They still make the same stupid mistakes, bump into walls and each other, use nitro when they approach corners etc. Cars are VERY easy to push away, no matter the size or ""weight"" (realistically, how could a Ferrari push away a truck).It also gets a bit repetitive once you reach Master, because then they'll unlock 20 pages of tracks for you to finish instead of individual cups. Found that very demotivating.Overall a great little game, fun tracks, fun music, dumb and annoying AI, reasonably priced car upgrades and enough variety."

It dose not make me want to come back but thats just me."
