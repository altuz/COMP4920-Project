If you dislike games with very clunky controls that makes it impossible to play; you'll hate this game. The utter freedom in creating any coaster design you want is great; even if you create physically impossible coasters that would rip it's riders apart; and the fast action makes it addictive. But, still, those controls. They make absolutely no sense; they're hard to get to when you need them and you'll find yourself spending more time crashing your coaster becuase you weren't able to get turned quick enough.It's a fun game, it's a *really* fun game; but the controls aren't suited for the kind of fast paced action this game throws at you. They're clunky, they're cumbersome, and they're just in no way suited for this game. If you find it on sale; it's worth about 2 bucks; but I wouldn't give any more for this game. It's a game you'll play; you'll probably never actually advance."

Its not a theme park came, but very much a build as you ride coaster generator. The concept is nice and create an easy pick up and play format. However, I find there is one main flaw in this game and that is the lack of a rewind feature.  It is quite frustrating to build a really long coaster and have it crash right at the end and have to start all over.  Either restarting 10 seconds before the crash or just a simple rewind feature to be able to go back to any point in your build and deviate from your original plan.  I would invest a lot more time in this game if this was the case. Otherwise, I see myself playing it seldomly."

,Recommended,209610,10057824,"Posted: 8 May, 2014",all,BridgetFisher,"This plays kind of like a magic carpet ride.  Wasnt sure what I was expecting from a 3d roller coaster, but in this game you just kind of move around and it lays track as you go.  You dont plan it out as in other tycoon type games.  In this game you need to collect gems adn do stunts.  The controller support is ok but the game is very picky if a jump says 50 mph, and your at 51 or 49 you crash.  Crashing would be more fun if people were on the roller coaster screaming, but the game is mostly silent minus a muted background track.  Meh, woulda been more fun to build a wild ride like Mr.Bones but there is no real building in this game just as you go.  Kind of like stearing a plane but it lays roller coaster track.Rating:  2/10  Value:  $1.99"

,Not Recommended,209610,16268640,"Posted: 8 June, 2015",all,BBSpeed26,"Literally the worst game I have ever played. It's broken, it's buggy, the controls are horrific. It presents itself as a roller coaster ""game""... but it's more of an awkward physics-less flight sim that draws a roller coaster track behind you... poorly... as you go.Every time I think about that I gave this developer money, I cringe and get irrationally angry. It is a complete disgrace of a game, and a shameless money grab. If Steam had their current review policy back when I bought this, rest assured that I would have returned it.Do not, under any circumstances, waste your money on this garbage."

Powerd by blood, the rollercoaster builds itself as it rides whilst feeding on its RAMPAGING destruction. Though beware! A lone monk has randomly blessed some nondestinct objects making them indestrucble, but which ones? Thats for you to find out!All in all, one big thrill ride of non consquential faffing about featuring both reflection and refraction.3/10"

Visually the game looks at first glance like an improved version of Rollercoaster Tycoon 3, and some care and attention has gone into creating a single park and a single design of coaster. Do not be decived by these superficial similarities.You build the track by piloting the first car through the air like a flight simulator, aiming for the next section of pre-built track, and hitting the space bar in a kind of quicktime event to try to connect to it.This is NOT a rollercoaster building game, it is not a park management game, I'm not sure what exactly it is if I'm honest. The closest thing I can compare it to is something like Temple Run, only with rollercoasters and a first person perspective.Each level, you are given a few segments of rollercoaster pre-built. Your job is to link them together, in the pre-set (but not shown) order, and that is it. You are asked to add various elements such as barel rolls or corkscrews in between each element, and there are gems to collect which basically show you exactly where your track should go (except not every section has gems, and then you're left circling round looking for the next segment of track). This all sounds quite fun so far, and would be a good game mechanic in a game like Rollercoaster Tycoon any of its rivals. But this game doesn't share any of those games mechanics.You cannot place track with any kind of sensible interface. You cannot undo your track except by restarting the level. You cannot see your ride from any perspective other than first person, riding in the front seat. I don't just mean when riding it, I mean all the time. You build the track by piloting the first car through the air like a flight simulator, aiming for the next section of pre-built track, and hitting the space bar in a kind of quicktime event to try to connect to it. This really isn't much fun at all, and leads to hilariously awful coasters with curves that would be impossible in real life and really not fun. Then by the time you get to level three, the game starts to feature pre-built segments that involve jumps and you realise that not even it takes itself seriously any more.Couple this awful gameplay and lack of realism with a terrible interface, bad colision detection (most of the time if your track collides with things the cars fly through the air and disintegrate, but sometimes they don't, and then you can have coasters going right through trees, buildings, and other bits of track), and you end up with a truely awful game.Run, run far away from this awful thing and never look back."

To be honest, it really isn't the best.The trailer is one of the reasons I bought this game (And it was half off). It really overhypes the gameplay. There is only one map, and some limitation to what you can do (I initally thought you could crash and destroy EVERYTHING from the ground to trees and certain buildlings).I haven't played all the levels and havent done much free mode so maybe I can't post a real review, but this is what I have experienced so far.I would reccomend it if it was on sale and you needed a quick little game to pass time or have some fun with something different (Just like buying DLC Quest).(Another quick thing is that it doesn't full screen at its start menu but changes when ingame. It can be a bit of a hassle at times :P)"

If you're looking for a rollercoaster simulation game where you get to painstakingly create and ride an awesome rollercoaster, this is not the game for you.  You play it in first person and ""build"" the roller coaster as you ride it.  It's awkward to control and frustrating to try to make a neat coaster without running into something and being forced to start over again."

There are fixed ""joints"" around the park, but you basically build the track in real time as you are collecting diamonds and trying to do corkscrews etc.Very arcadey, and loads of fun.There are a few bugs which are especially noticable when you go back to ride the track you just made, but ultimately they're forgivable. The option to play in 3d just adds to it. Rollercoasters + 3d are a winning combination.It's cheap and well worth a look if you can overlook some of the bugs."
