It has other more important flaws, yet still I had fun playing it for the first few hours, but it got old very fast. While playing I thought that some small things could've been added to make the player care more. For a ""war"" game, there's actually no deaths, no characters. Everyone is a robot, nobody seems to care, so why should the player care for casualties, losses or individual unit? I enjoyed the idea of the gameplay, but I think that story and world immersion matters the most in games. I think a story mode should be added, because no matter how good or bad the gameplay is, as long as there are characters/people for who the player starts to care for, the game will be loved. There are games out there that have basically no gameplay at all, but just a very good story ... and those games are a success!http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=584283212http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=923672691Unlocked all achievements!"

You can also put it in patroll mode to guard your base, sentry mode to guard a specific area and brain hunt where it will go towards the enemy's bunker and find its way to the brain. And if needed, call down a V2 rocket piloted by a drunk pilot who will probably crash, but still deliver your fully-outfitted troops roughly where you wanted them (or you just lob them from space in a box and let it crash a few metres deep in the sand, forcing them to crawl out of the gaping hole while hostiles throw molotov cocktail inside, fun times!)I must say, this game is very fun to play, Its simple, creative and action packed!Hell, i had a soldier once who faced off agains three other robots, his legs got shot of and his rifle got destroyed, so he switched to his pistol and killed all three of them before bleeding out.It's these awesome moments that make this game so great! Shooting down a dropship and witnessing the soldiers under it getting flattend by it or a squad heroicly fighting off hordes of crash-test dummies while trying to block their entrypoint with a concrete launcher, and all of this happened in those few hours i've played!Worshop makes it even better, adding in units from other games like Warhammer 40K or Halo makes it much more interessting, even adding in a few new maps is always fun!The only downsides i've encountered is the clunky menu, the poor UI, lacking tutorial and the fact that there is no Free camera mode.There barely is a UI besides the circular hold-the-right-mousebutton one which is a little confusing at first, the tutorial is very minimum, but you learn the basics of the game pretty fast anyways. And the camera, well, thats permanently focussed on the unit you are using, so no looking around the place, which is annoying if you hear a dropship nearby, but you can't see it.But for my final verdict, this game is a must-buy for people who like customising their own troops individualy, who like games that tell stories about how badass the units were in that one battle against those 100 crabs and for those who just like building giant, trap-filled bunkers for the CPU to breach (which it will, he'll just dig into the brain's bunker right away)I give it a score of 8.5/10, take that Metacritic!"

As for gameplay, it's interesting to say the least. The game is definitely not a realistic combat simulation, but it definitely uses jetpacks in ways they've never been used before. Keep the throttle on for too long and you'll find yourself zooming across the map at the speed of sound. As for actual combat, it's thought out and entertaining. Things such as bullet weight and velocity play a good part in battle; a pistol's bullets will literally bounce off enemies if they're too far away, while a sniper rifle is heavy to carry but can penetrate armor from a good distance. You'll soon find that when you build your base you'll be putting down heavily armored juggernauts with rocket launchers and LMGs since you don't need them to move much (you'll also find weight is a real hinderance since jetpacks are the only real way to move) while your assault troops will probably just have that one remote-detonation-grenade launcher you think is really cool. While most battles have the simple objective ""kill the enemy brain"", there are alternative game modes available in the base game, like surviving with one troop for a set amount of time or holding down a base being attacked by dummies.Cortex Command isn't for everyone, but if you don't mind a random decapitation becuase you hit the roof from time to time and you're not super serious about realism then this game will be worth the money."

I've sent many troops to their untimely demise, won wars, lost some, found true love (Dummy Expansion mod), and mercilessly and slowly killed an unarmed enemy troop with a weak pistol, just to see him suffer. In all my playtime is probably double what it says it is, due to me playing the **** out of my brother's copy before I got the game myself.The physics are quite pleasing, as is seeing an exploding drop ship door take out one of my men on the other side of the map (Fun fact! The doors are actually programmed to have a small chance toaim for your men... Scary.). The pixel art is superb, not to mention how pleasing it is to kill someone. And the mods will probably entertain you for many more hours. In all- in my opinion anyways, this is a pretty damn good game.Shame that the developers seem to be a bunch of jerks who made a bunch of empty promises and then left this game to slowly die with the only thing it has to look forward to is a couple of 'okay' mods due to the legendary modders leaving with the developers.

I think the first thing to make clear is the game is not fun without mods.  The vanilla factions, whilst fun for a while are lacking in many ways and the stuff the community comes up with is much more interesting.The game has some great unique gameplay though. You control a brain, your brain and can use it to control bodies and craft that are called in from space. The game is a weird hybrid of RTS, Side scrolling shooter and Physics puzzler. Each body you control has physics and weight (giving them more weapons makes em heavier) lighter bodies can fly easier but will also die when colliding with concrete at high speed. Heavier bodies can't fly as well but the concrete will get smashed before their faces. The game also has a base building aspect (in some modes) where you put together a 'brain bunker' from various bits and pieces and defend it from people who do not like your brain. Throw in a few mods and the strange physics and unique gameplay make for a highly entertaining experiance....until it crashes.Cortex command is far from stable. It'll crash regularly once you get a few mods going and the loading time when booting up the game does make every crash a tragedy.All things said though I reccomend the game if you can get it on sale. Grab a few mods (I reccomend void wanderers and a few compatible factions to go with it) and have fun shouting at a crash test dummy to stop shooting the doors."

I had watched videos and done a little bit of research, and the game simply looked amazing for what it was. A unique side scrolling take on RTS.When I actually got to hop in the game however, things went bad fast.First off, learning the controls, even with the assistance of the tutorial was a pain. They only explain the bare minimum in how you can switch out to other units under your influence, and how to control them on a basic level. They tell you nothing of how you're supposed to actually use the unit, or how to activate its various AI scripts and what they actually do. The UI is bare minimum, you have to dig and test everything out on your own just to figure out things that should be presented directly, or have better in game descriptions.While actually controlling your units, you'll find they are slow and terribly clunky. Even the faster/lighter units feel that way, and there's simply no way around. Heavy units are a literal nightmare to move around the map. With heavier units you'll find it almost impossible to reach certain areas, forcing you to use easily killed light units for everything, and only equipping them with the absolute bare minimum to assault the enemy. Attempting to use the AI scripts usually just forces them to saunter off to their deaths, they end up firing into the air blindly or never returning fire, while the enemy computer controlled units decimate your forces from half a mile away with a pistol.While all the equipment and units you can call down are interesting, you'll find yourself most times just calling down basic units due to the cost to protect yourself, while the opponent seems to have near infinite resources he can call on. Even when you have a ton of money it seems to run out in seconds, where there's seem to have no end, even on the easier settings. That and the fact you'll notice the enemy AI is quite crafty in going after your controller unit/brain. Assassinating him from impossible angles, or simply just scuicide bum rushing you, while your idiot AI forces stand there and watch slack jawed, even is they are on sentry/defense mode.There are a number of mods out there that can expand the gameplay, adding modes, areas, new factions and weapons and other things. Some of them are quite excellent, and it's to bad there was such a great modding community for this game, but the developer half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥it for about 10 years. Yep, that's right. This game was 10 years in development before seeing a ""full"" version launch. Looking at the game now you'd probably be wondering where the full version is. It feels much more like a late alpha build, or very early beta.Like I said, it's such a shame there was such a passionate modding community, their talents and time went to waste on a devolper and his half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥game, when the modders could have put their attentions elsewhere and made something amazing in a game people actually care about.If you can get the game for dirt cheap on sale for like 90% off go for it. Simply to check it out, and see ""what could have been"". The potential you can see in videos and in the game itself is amazing. But, the deveolper simply never capitilized on it, and now it sits as pretty much abandonware, festering here on Steam, where the deveolper is still asking money for a dead and rotting corpse of a product he will never patch, update, touch, or even look at again.If the source code gets released, and others pick it up and do something with it, the results might just be amazing. So keep your eyes open if or when that happens.Until then, stay away from this festering pile of abandonware garbage."

Yea that sounds right. So, (at least for me) a game against ""inferior AI"" Is difficult. Because the control scheme is so wonky and odd.Okay dont get me wrong, the concept is cool as hell, but the AI is 10 times quicker than you. So lets say you order units and the AI orders units. Okay you order units, have to group them up (or just go one by one) and tell them to go Brain hunting. 9 times out of 10, your AI team will ATTEMPT to brain hunt, then get stuck on a pile of corpses from prior versions of its squad. Oh well.However the AI player? It's able to control its units with Ease, Call down a carrier, Then instantly brain hunt for your base. Even seperatly control the units and get past a pile of corpses.The factions are nice. The concept is cool as all hell, but it'd be much better with Friends or online multiplayer. Sadly the game doesnt support, online multiplayer only local multiplayer. Which is a tad ridiculous in my opinion but hey, whatever they want to do.You see, I got the game for 1.99 and not the full price of 19.99. At 19.99 I feel it would be hard to give this a positive review. However At 1.99 (It should honestly be $10) the game feels well. What I paid for. It's like a Newgrounds Flash game, just done much better.The factions are interesting, I like the concept, Everything about this game is interesting. But I have 0 clue how to play, Because the tutorial didnt go over that well. And even so, the AI is 10 times better than me. Overall I recommend it at its current summer sale price but I must say my overrall review of this is Neutral. There's not even a Borderless option and the game likes to act just. Wonky.

The biggest draw of CC is it's sandbox like nature, allowing you to play around, or give yourself a challenge. The biggest flaw with CC is that it really doesn't have much to do in it, it's more of a game that you'll pick up and play from time to time than a deep game you'll spend hours with. That said, it never really gets old unless you play really often, it has dedicated mod support to keep things interesting, and a great multiplayer mode.

I believed the latest vid from the developer, stating that a lot of previous issues have been fixed etc, and so picked it up for $6 in a steam sale, but to be honest it must have been pretty bad before if this is supposed to be significantly improved.It definitely has potential: the combat could be fun if it wasn't so unbalanced, and the destruction/debris is nice.The split-screen mode is one of the main reasons I picked it up.  A friend of mine who loves quirky indie games was coming over for the evening and this looked perfect.  We're used to playing a fair share of alpha/beta/unfinished Public Domain games where bugs are often part of the charm, but even this was too much for us and we gave up after about an hour.  I've since played it a little more on my own to see if we missed something, but as hard as I tried I couldn't feel anything but frsutration when playing this.If you can figure out how to work around the weird bugs, the swampy controls, and the terrible GUI, then you might like it.  In the interest of fairness, I should say that I haven't tried any of the mods.

If I recall back when I played on Build 23 the game itself was like 50-60 MB in size and the mods were nearly 3 GB. That's like playing Skyrim with 700 GB worth of mods. This is an Indie game that has it's own standards and priorities that diverge, tremendously, from that of AAA titles.

The downside was that it was not enough to satisfy the audience.When BUILD 30 came out last year, the game basically added the best feature (so far). Steam Workshop, which includes mods so strange and epic, has filled those ""missing"" gaps. The mods can range to a crab army to a super smart computer that can rupture brains, build structures, and more.Also, the physics are another thing people don't look at. Some moments in the game are like movie moments and that they are NON SCRIPTED. Now that just blew me away when I first played it.Now, if I had to have one downside to this game, it would be that if you install TOO many mods, the game will take forever to load.You should take my word instead of others and get this game, you will not be dissapointed and if you are...

Cortex Command is an incredibly depressing game. It's a beautiful brainchild of a passionate person or people who just did not want to polish their ideas. They game has been in development about eight years now, and it's still in a miserable state. It's horribly bug ridden, there are amazingly careless and obvious mistakes and errors, there's huge balance issues and very little depth, and it's stagnated for a ridiculous amount of time. This game is going nowhere. It's a perpetual prototype, seemingly never to be fixed or improved. A prototype with game-breaking bugs, including the overworld map not fitting on the screen, or fullscreen causing immense lag, or you just getting stuck in a wall all the time. Not to mention the game has prolonged lagging episodes constantly.But what a fun prototype it can be. The game is at times incredibly tense as you try to find an opening to shoot while desperately trying to avoid having any bit of you out in the open, and the game is at times hilarious as drop pods go astray and crash into a squad of troops. It is perfectly viable to win by dropping a crate of crabs on the enemy brain's head. They game is incredibly silly, but also extremely engaging. It takes a lot of effort to take down some of the enemies, and it feels very rewarding when you manage to do so. The base game has incredibly potential.Let's talk about the actual game for a second. It's a 2D shooter with strategy elements. It's very hard to compare, there's really nothing like it. You have your typical base building aspects; you want a unit or two mining for gold, yet you also want a few armed units hanging around defending your brain/HQ. Most of the time you're be controlling a single offensive unit of some sort, kitted out to your liking. You have to make sure your brain lives, and the enemy's brain dies.It's set in multiple scenarios. There are a few separate missions, including a horde/defense mode and a few assualt based modes. There's also a campaign mode, where you will capture points and build bases on them, then try to take over the opponent's bases. Although, that mode suffers from the previously mentioned glitch concerning the overworld map, making it so you cannot see and select some of the base building points, making it impossible to win. And that's it. You got about five missions and a frankly boring and repetitive campaign mode and that's it. There are a few nice mods that add some, but it's just a bit more icing atop an inch-tall cake. You ought experience everything the base game in about four hours, you can add probably add another four to six with mods. It depends how much you can stomach before getting bored.The game has a very robust physics engine which allows you to contort into all sorts of hilarious positions, but it is also incredibly clunky. The menues are a mess, the characters are extremely slow, and you will accidentally kill yourself in hysterical yet infuriating ways. This is a good and bad thing. At first it's novel and interesting, then it's incredibly frustrating. Then it's a bit easier, then it grows fairly boring. There is a huge arsenal of weapons, but a lot of them feel the same, and a lot of them are somewhat disinteresting. Again, the base game is there, and it's great, but there is absolutely no filling, and there is bare minimum content. Your enjoyment of the game will depend entirely on how much you can put up with repitition and how far the bare basics of the gameplay can carry you.In the end, I cannot recommend Cortex Command at the asking price of twenty dollars. That's simply too expensive for so little content and polish. It's also a game that I don't entirely feel comfortable supporting, as it's eight years in development yet still contains crippling bugs. It really feels like the developers just didn't want to bother polishing their initial ideas, they didn't want to do the boring parts. It's like an unedited paper, they just wanted to jolt down all their interesting thoughts and conclusions but they didn't want to spend time making it presentable to an audience. Such a shame.On sale, you might want to consider it. It's got a few laughs and fun moments between the frustration of the brief experience, and it has a lot of toys for the more imaginative players. If you like weird 2D shooters with comically spasmic physics engines with some resource management, wait for a fifty percent sale bringing it down to ten dollars. If you're not interested in that or you can't stand major bugs or you need significant motivation besides gameplay, avoid it like the plague. Also, don't bet on this game ever being finished, or even improving significantly. Eight years of dead air does not bode well."

Maybe both.It's true what they say, the game is dead or sure as hell as close to dead as possible, but there's just something that keeps bringing me back from time to time.  No, I did not own the game during a more livelier time of development, the only one that I've ever received my time being here was the last one.  The one that fixed performance, which I was indeed thankful for.For some reason, I can't help but recommend it.  I wouldn't say it's worth twenty dollars, unless you're easily entertained by something that's consistant of the same thing (shooting your opponent in the brain and his pawns in the brainless heads) or something that can be used to waste time in a humorous or even entertaining manner.The game itself is simple, mostly comprised of building a base strong enough to protect your brain in a jar, much like a skull would, if a skull could endure bombs and such.  You bring in mindless clones, controlled manually or with basic AI, to defend your base.  This main concept is build upon with multiple gamemodes such as the campaign, in which you assault other bases and try to take over the planet for that sweet gold income.  The major flaw is that this game itself relies a lot on the community, as it'll easily get boring with just the same few factions you're given in the base game, often requiring you to grab mods.  If you don't like repetition, even though it can be amusing at times, or dev abandonment, this probably isn't the game for you.I have not, however, tried out multiplayer seeing as I'm a loser with no friends in my close area.  If you want a game to hotseat and probably die laughing with a companion as the two of you crab bomb the hell out of eachother, maybe this is for you as well.Just be sure not to add too many crabs, you might die from hyper-accelerated crab particles or other deadly crab-related radiation."

It's almost to a point where it is unplayble.  Unfortunately, it does not matter what type of rig you have,  because this game only utlizes 1 cpu core and limited GPU as far as i know.  Either way the lag always creeps up and ruins the experience.    I don't know if there is a fix for this because the engine it was built on is old.I don't see how they can recommend playing this with 4 friends, when the lag crushes the experience with just two people.

While I don't know if that's the bast analogy, this game certainly brings the best of both genres to the table.  There is a constantly changing battlefield that doesn't reset all the holes and debris just because the fight ends for the day.  There's also an element of creating a safe shelter to direct the operation from, as the whole fight hinges on success or failure in keeping safe one particular member of your forces.I should also point out that in my opinion, CC is not a game about tactical fighting.  Yes, you did just read me deny the majority of standing opinion.  AI can be used for most battle functions that the player can direct, granted not as efficiently as a skilled cortex operator - but no AI can manage your funds.  This game is about war economy.  Deciding what's necessary for an attack and implementing those choices, while keeping back enough money to create a defense.  Bring your management skills: all transactions may just be gold dust but you have to operate a stable system of income and expense to dominate the resource race."

It's fully destructable, being able to shoot through scenery & dig/explode a new path, or it can hinder you as when the bodies & debris pile up, they become part of the scenery & will hinder movement & bullets.There's alot of physics involved in the game, so movement takes ALOT of getting used to, & the game is still buggy, but so far it's been extremely fun to play, hope the developers keep supporting it!Overall, if you're looking for a game that lets you fully customise your base, soldiers & gameplay, THIS is the game you are looking for!"

You have a lot of weapons to choose from, alot of equipment and a lot of gear to arm your robot avatars with, and the particle and physics effects are very neat to see. Unfortunately it only takes about an hour of play to exhaust all the fun you could have with this game. Every thing becomes to repetative. Small skirmeshes that range from to easy to almost impossible if you miss manage what little resources you have, and an overall unfocused set of game types thrown in almost as an afterthought. The multiple weapon types offer a bit of strategy to an otherwise mindless game, but once you become adept with some of the more exotic guns the game has to offer, you can abandon any strategy the game has in favor of brute strength.Playing against a human oppenent makes things far more interesting, but having only local multiplayer in this type of game seems like a rather silly design choice by the developer. If this game really took a decade to make, perhaps another year on the design table would have done this game wonders."

It's great because it has a unique gameplay system, random terrain generation, and a decently fun campaign mode. The bad side is actually playing the game can be difficult and it's tricky to make wise decisions to stay ahead of the AI and be successful. I mostly view this as an extra challenge, but the heavy difficulty has lead to me not playing this game too much. Overall it's a good game and it's a fun to play. I do enjoy how open-ended it is and how you can be creative with equipment and various purchases you made."

Usually, as an extended demo, so I can really see if I like a game or not.If I like it, I buy it. If I don't, I don't buy it, and since I don't like it, get rid of it.I liked this game enough to wait for it to be max price before buying it; mainly to support the dev.But that's saying something.(This'll be primarily based off of the metagame, which is, in this game, a randomly generated sandbox campaign.)Anyways, this game is basically a 2-D construction and combat sandbox, in a more literal sense of the word.You basically have these things called 'brains' which are essentially command units. How you have more than one, I don't know, but you don't have an actual body because humanity 'evolved' past it.So, you have to protect these brain units, while killing the enemy brain, in order to win.Then you dig in, build your base/bunker, and wait for them to attack.However, to win, you need the most gold. In order to get gold, you need 'sites.'You need to manage between these, bulding, attacking, defending, etc.If you're not Control+R (ing) each mission, it's somewhat difficult, because anything can happen. You can either die upon entering, or a random explosion may occur above your brain, or you may get attacked and realize all too late.The only issue is performance, but it's better now. Better...The only other downside other than that, I think, is the lack to choose what you attack with. It randomly assigns weapons and troops on either rocket type and I often find myself annoyed with what I get. I often send my rockets back before they even land, if I can.I don't think changing difficulty does much, though. I know changing 'actor' skill changes accuracy but that's it.It also has a very unique setting, and the lore is pretty interesting if you read up on it."

For a while it's fun to fly around with your jetpacks, shoot stuff, and try things from the workshop, but at the end it's not much more than the rather unsatisfying slashing of the dumb enemy horde-AI.If you are looking for a combat sandbox, try the Men of War series in singleplayer, where you can command EVERY unit with WASD (like in Cortex Command), but actually need a strategy (unlike in Cortex Command). If you are looking for a 2D combat sandbox, try King Arthur's Gold (Multiplayer).

,Recommended,209670,9924890,"Posted: 24 April, 2014",all,aceunknown,"Back in my young college days there was a downloaded version of this game going around amongst my friends (I really wanted to buy it but couldn't spare even the small amount of money required). At the time it was an unfinished sandbox where you basically downloaded mods and shoot crazy guns and stuff at terrible AI that practically just stood there.Now there's actually a game here. The campaign consists of taking and defending territories while competing with up to 3 othere AI players. You pick a place and if anyone challenges you for it you fight for it. Once you take it you can either design your own base within it, or pick a budget and let the game build one for you.I found designing things to be a little unfriendly because i wasn't sure what everything was, and it can take a lot of time depending on how crazy you want to get. Considering that at the moment the campaign doesn't usually last a long time depending on how good you are and the settings you choose I didn't feel compelled to do it. Additionally you'll be taking over several bases over the course of the game and it would be insane to manually build each one unless you were really quick. However, the autobuilding feature of the game tends to build some pretty decent looking bases. The problem is that each day you give the computer a budget for your base and then it decides how to spend the money and in what order. This means over time the base will get better but at the beginning you might have a pretty incomplete base. When you get attacked and you have an incomplete base, it can be nearly impossible to protect.The actual battles are where the game shines. You start with a brainbot or if you have a base he might just be a brain in a jar. He's basically your commander and if his fragile brain jar gets destroyed then its game over. I usually send him down to dig for gold while i let my other units guard him.This game is a physics based game where each pixel acually has its own properties. Units are actually made up of connected parts that move and interact based on their physics. This means that every part of a character can be blown off and every spec of dirt or other material has its own properties that can be deformed. Bullets go through softer objects and ricochet off harder ones. Rockets all have their own forces and when they explode they shred into pieces that can effect characters around the environment.This game is run by gold and every unit is bought and dropped into your scene through the buy menu that will let you customize the unit and what it's carrying. generally they all have jetpacks, and weight matters so you dont want to bog a guy down too much otherwise he'll get stuck a lot and won't be able to jetpack too high.Once a unit is called down you can take control of him and use his arsenal to take out other units and hopefully their brain. This is the part thats both amazingly fun, hilarious, and sometimes frustrating. The AI has gotten pretty smart at navigating around the levels and everyone is so fragile it can get pretty difficult, but in a good way. Especially when you're outnumbered and units are getting close to your brain. Having to fend off guys while simultaneously trying to buy and call down more units can be really tense. Especially because you're always working within a changing budget. Juggling shooting things, buying things, and budgetting can be pretty crazy at times.But the real craziness comes from the Cortex Command moments you'll experience. Blowing up dropships and having them rollover and land on top of the guys they just dropped off, then exploding is always awesome. Jetpacking out of control and then smashing into 3 enemy NPCs and watching everyone explode is hilarious. Sniping a guy from long range and watching his parts just fly off is super satifying, and if you get your hands on a rocket launcher, you're in for some serious entertainment. These moments almost never get old, and will keep you playing this game for hours on end. Even when you totally fail the simplest task and all these things happen to you, its still hilarious.And when you get bored? There are a bunch of great secenarios and community made mods on the steam workshop that will keep the game fresh. weegee's unmapped lands 2 mod is a really great conversion of the campaign and probably more fun than the vanilla game itself. He even has his own interpretation of FTL in the CC world that's worth checking out.I'll be honest, this game has a bit of a learning curve. In the current state I'm reviewing this game it's unfinished. The developer has admitted that all the features are in the game, they just arent polished, and thats true. There is a tutorial that does an okay job of teaching you the basics of combat and mining gold, but as far as the campaign part of the game goes, there's basically no guidance at all. The community has made up for this though.In it's current state it's a game you can sit down and play for 15mins or 5 hours. However, you can really see the potential of the game, and it can really only get better from here on out. It's a great game to add to your collection, play until your burnt out, forget about it for a year or two, and then play it until your burnt out again. It's that solid and that evergreen. You'll never get tired of blowing things up.Like the developer says in the video on the Store page. This game reviewed several years ago by alot of major sites in was was obviously an unfinished state. I'm not sure of the specific circumstances behind that, but this isnt the same game it was then. I'd argue it wasn't even a game then. Now it is, but still unfinished.The message here is, don't believe the major reviews or metacritic score. Read the reviews on steam. Everyone is recommending it, just like myself."

The entire game is physics based. The walking, flying, climbing, and crawling, is done with your own characters 2 hands and 2 feet. Also, the plethora of mods, secenarios, and minigames make this game fun as hell even if you exhausted the vanilla game. Most of the major problems this game had before (Stupid AIs couldn't follow through with orders, Glitches, and movement errors) have been fixed. The new squad system has made the AI competent at organizing troops. You can create a squad to attack the enemy base, and turn around and focus protecting your own.  Just bringing down soldiers is awesome. Nothing is as beautiful as several dropships floating down from the sky, with AA missiles rising up to meet them. The game is just so versatile. Need to clear an enemy bunker? Send in masses of cheap robots, clones, or zombies, or send in a heavily armed squad of tough elite units, or fricking have crash test dummies go the long way around dig through the walls to eliminate their defenseless commander.This game is special.

I've always been fascinated in the intricate physics system, and how literally every single pixel has it's own properties outside of being purely visual.I feel like this isn't as appreciated as it should be, but really, the fact that Cortex Command has split screen local multiplayer is SO GREAT. Just as the intro screen says, just grab some buddies and controllers, and you've got yourself a mighty fine party game.While there are bits about it that are ridiculously unstable, there's always so much going on in any game that I can't help but to laugh whenever characters randomly explode into bits for absolutely no reason.

That one review that flashes by in his video is still relevant: ""less than the sum of its parts"", this means it is an AWESOME game... in theory... lol. So what the game should be is so unique and fun, but it needs more than polishing, still. The AI is still buggy, if thats what it is, specifically: when I was building my own base i noticed the AI getting stuck in a spot that was obviously a glitch, whatever mechanic that may be. The only other complaint I have is this game needs a better tutorial. The tutorial gave me an idea of how to play, but when I started a campain, I was completley lost. Still, with all that, this is an extremely unique game and I will still recomend it in the hope that it will be patched up."

Figure it out guys.-Get some procedural generation code in there for the maps. Right now you tend to play on the same maps.

If you get this game, get the mods. (Some will crash or conflict with each other. Early 2000's am I right?) Just make sure they are for the right build. Too many mods will also make the start up time take several minutes.I have never had so much fun getting mods than with this game. Really cool stuff. Most of my time consisted of spawning tons of units, dropping bombs on them to gib. This was MY early 2D Garry's Mod. The combat was fun. I never really got too into the ""Team Tactics"" of the game as it was pretty broken, but I've heard since then they fixed it, and by fixed it, I mean they don't dig a hole by walking back and fourth over your brain before finally tunneling straight to it.EVERYTHING but the base pieces gib. Ships, units, guns, it all gibs. Huge selection of units, guns, anything really. Workshop makes the whole mod installation a lot easier. Digging is an option too, if you wanted to get to a base from below, you can get there. Low on gold? Just go mining.It also lets you build your own base at the start of each round. You can choose from: modules, bits and pieces, doors, and your brain room. It was pretty good.The graphics were a lovable detailed pixel style that had me at hello, The sprites, the ground, and the units were incredibly charming to me.If you like destroying things, or are a big sandbox guy, I'd say this game is totally worth your buy.It's got it's bugs but I can safely say it was worth my buy.My total non-biased rating would finalize at an 8/10"
,Recommended,209670,33324654,Posted: 6 July,all,Whac-A-Mole Jutsu,"Cortex Command is a game that has the player as a disembodied brain that can take control of units dropped from space in order to complete numerous tasks, such as destroying an enemy brain, defending a base, or playing a game of Keepie-Uppie with a rocket. The game is coded in Lua, and the developers encourage modding, and mods are what make this game shine. Even though the community is slowly releasing few mods, the older, bigger mods might as well be a part of the game, as they have few bugs, and are massive in scope.One of the biggest things that sets this apart from other games like it is the complete lack of online multiplayer, yet with four player local multiplayer, and it works perfectly. The game can be played with a keyboard and mouse, the numberpad, and two controllers.The other big thing that sets it apart from all games is... Crab Bombs. A magical weapon of mass destruction that can do anything from killing everything (including you) to crashing the game, as well as your computer.TL;DR: 8/10, modding is easy and encouraged, local multiplayer instead of online, Crab Bombs are fun."

These can be found on the workshop.GAMEPLAYYou play on a 2D sideview map usually with your brain and the enemy's brain having to dig gold and purchase different 'actors' to be delivered from orbit for you to use to attempt to destroy the enemy brain.The physics in this game are very detailed and very important to winning. However, it may also be the thing that turns some people off. It makes movement feel somewhat 'heavy' and can be frustrating to get the hang of. But once you figure it out you'll be flying (yes everyone gets a jet pack) the body of your recently de-limbed trooper into the face of the enemy, hopefully decapitating them with the force... or maybe knocking the gun out of their hand... or the enemy might just laugh and shoot your face off.All in all this style is easy to understand and very fun to execute due to the large amount of actors and equipment you can choose from. However some things like the grappling gun and repeller gun are not very useful or practical in normal games.STORYNot much here. We're a bunch of space brains with unlimited armies at our backs that are ready and willing to blast each other for gold.GRAPHICSThe graphical style is wonderfuly done pixel art that isn't to pixely and is pixely enough it doesn't look cheap. It has just the right amount of detail to fantasticaly render every body part and machine piece as they explode and pile up on the map.CONCLUSIONThis is definently THE funnest game I have ever played in my life. The entertainment value is endless due to the active modding community and making mods yourself isn't that hard. It certainly won't disappoint if you can get used to the controls."

The graphics are fine, but not overly complicated.It's mostly focused on physics than graphics. Which, in my personal opinion, is so much more fun.You can quite literally move, create and destroy every single pixel in the game.Don't let my hours of game-time fool you. It's a great game.If you're still not convinced though, let me talk about the story/gameplay options.You take the role of one (or more) brains, and in the metagame, your mission is to take over areas, and defeat the enemies. All in the meantime, you have to manage your money (gold) to not run out, because then you're basicallyscrewed.Actually, you can dig out gold ores in certain areas to immediately gain some money.However, a Metagame can take a long time. Considering if you're building your own bases (which you can do), grinding up money from areas, taking your time in battles.. you get the idea. It's a long time.If you're not into that, or perhaps you are a busy person, you can easily go into a scenario battle, and mess around.Make small battles, or gigantic wars at your heart's desire.. and i still haven't mentioned the mods!Boy would i go on forever.The modding community in this game is amazing. Starting from the half-life combine tech, all the way to the Gears of War weapons. Guess what? Even YOU can make mods! It ain't that difficult if you look into it a bit more.Though i must warn you, too many actors; or older PCs may lag, as this is a heavily physics & AI based game. Just throwin' it out there.Honestly, it's worth your money, as long you're into 2D Chaos & Strategy, and you're not looking for realistic graphics, but rather, for hella fun gameplay.In conclusion, give this game a 10/10.

Where the game really shines is its modding community, if you go to its modding page you will find a hundred or so mods which get updated every so often and sometimes new ones are added as well, for me that made it worth it to play the game for more than 100 hundred hours with friends, the only down sides are that each loaded mod increases loading times by a lot, I have to wait 5 minutes for my game to start and hope I had enabled/disabled the mods I wanted, the other downside is that it can only be played on the same computer or with LAN, no online multiplayer, overall I think this game, its developers and the modding community are awesome."

Everything about it screams retro side scroller, however I was pleasantly suprized to see alot of interesting gameplay mechanics. It's part castle defense, part RTS, part contra style shootem up. If any of these things sound appealing to you this may just be your game: building the most inpenitrable base, sending waves of units to take out an enemy base, or Running around blowing limbs of scores of baddies, Resourse management and development, or sitting back and letting the computer do it for you.The game is based in a very distant future where people's brains controll robotic legions to fight over resources. Everything about the game can be found in its opening cutscene (which might i add is freaken awsome) The core gameplay revolves around you Brain... both literally and virturally represented. The brain is either a moving robot or a static part of your defense that controlls all other actors and units. Its pretty simple kill the Brain, win the game. Initially when you occupy a planet at the same time as an opponet your brain will be air assaulted in with a few minor units ( In most cases a mobile sentry with anti arcraft rocket) From there you can call in additional units expending a gold resource that can be mined. Once a plannet is in your controll you can put your gold into building your dream base or have the computer do it for you. In the campain you set the number of factions and faction types along with the number of brains they have. Once all the brains are gone you win... or loose. Lets move on to the actors/units you can rain firery death with.There are a few tarting factions in the game ( which can be expanded with player made mods) Each faction has a pool of troops (actors) weapons, tools, and aircraft to choose from. In the campaing by selecting a certain faction gives you a discount towards thier troops and gear, however you are not constrained to just that faction type. When your brain calls up troops you'll have a window that you may select the troops and thier eqipment. You start of with how they get thier, what troop type, and eqipment thier carrying. The initial equipment and weapons is expansive, with every weapon and tool verying greatly between eachother. A unit can hold many weapons and tools and freely switch between them on the fly, however if you load up on to much you cant fly... This brings me to another point. All your units are equiped with jet packs. This is both awesome and fustrationg as menuvering your flyboys and girls cand take some practice; and will most likely end up with your trooper splattered against a wall or something. Its almost like Tribes meets Contra.The combat in this game can be pretty intertaining. All troops have body parts that can be blown off with well aimed shots; can make them beguin to bleed out or not. Another option is shooting the weapons out of enemies hands. The RTS aspect lets you select a groop of actors and set them on a patroll, Guard, Brain hunt mode, or designated points. You can also form a squad and have them move together and/or follow you. This is a pretty interesting aspect and gives the game some depth and versitility. If you feel like being rambo you can,  want to dropp in with an expensive hit team into the heart of the enemy defenses you can, or if You just want to send wave after wave of troops while you mine for gold Terraria style to fund it YOU CAN!This is a very enjoyable game and has many interesting elements not utilized by other games. It is however not without its faults. The AI can be less desirable at times, as in getting stuck or just flat out non responsive. The game has a tendency to crash when overloaded with actors in the campain feature. The campain is very easy even on hard difficulty and there are many ways of rigging your planet to be niegh impenitrable. It would be a great improvement if you could choose to drop a couple bombs on key locations before your very vulnerable brain drops from the heavens just to get shot down my spammed rocket infantry.All in all this is a great indi game and well worth a few bucks just to experience an outside the box game. It didnt have the backing of a AAA design team, yet still happens to pack some oomph."

This is because the developer has a great game on his hands here but he does not update frequently (its been in development for 11 years) and bugs and crashes run rampant.It is unpolished and by far perfect but you will get some good laughs and carnage out of it.I recomend buy it on sale.

(would only get maybe a couple hours out of it wihtout the mods)Cons:-Performance-Crashes, Bugs, etc.-Few  updates. Last one came about a month ago, but a year after the one before it...-In general unpolished (Ex: walking sucks, terrain doesnt always get dug up properly, little stuff like that)These cons can easily be fixed so if they do i will delete all of them and give a purely positive review on the game, because thats all there will be left to say.PLEASE FIX PERFORMANCE!

I have had moments where I've been winning a battle by a landslide and they send in troops that absolutely wreck me. I'd then push foreword and get pushed back again and again. the difficulty slider being seperate from the A.I. intelligence slider is also incredibly fun. You can set the enemies to be bullet sponges, sure, but you can also get them to be intelligent and capable of taking you down. the campaign mode is fun at the higher difficulties, but I do feel that some more content and game modes would be fun. All in all, the game is fantastic and I highly recommend it. 11/10 it has eaten my life.Also, I recommend modding this game.

That, and the very fun elements of the game that I have enjoyed have permitted me to enjoy what I got so far, and hope for more. The game is inventive and seems to be a great piece of work. The problems it has fall into three major categories.1) Streamlining.Its pretty self explanatory here, but when I'm trying to build bases or order soldiers / guns, it takes forever to navigate back and forth between the menus. You'll know how to get from place to place after one good attempt, but the actual act of manuevering is never easy.2) Polish.AI needs some work. The bots are at the same time both lethal to enemies and themselves. They're bad at following you,  but sometimes highly skilled at it. They can't hit anything for♥♥♥♥♥♥ one half of the time, and they're Rambo the other half. Some refinement would be much appreciated.3) Glitches and Freezing.I played this game happily with both previous problems until I was no longer able to enjoy it because the game stopped working. It would freeze during loading for around 5 minutes, then load the menu, freeze for a few minutes loading a game, and then again during play. This is a problem for any game, especially ones that aren't finished, but it needs work.Still, after all of this, you should buy this game. Its hilarious and wonky, and sometimes a little unweildy, but its a great game and its worth your time and hard earned cash."

But so what? I can literally spend hours on this game lag or no lag.I see people complaining about strategy?Ramp the diffiulty up to nuts the enemy A.I. up to unfair and give about 10,000 funds and now you're gonna need some strategy. I've spent ages simply designing and redesigning bases to find the best way to stop myself getting destroyed by the enemy.The only downside I can find in this game is the lack of multiplayer. If it was implemented my hours in this game would probably be much much higher. But unfortunately as far as I can gather due to the way the engine is multiplayer seems impossible. But if it is the last thing that the devs ever did for this game I would be so happy.So,Cortex Command.

The game is NOT worth 20$. The game has many options to build your base, one can potentially create a large labryninth of corridors and rooms with intricate turrets and defendable positions. This isn't a positive though, as the annoying mobility of the game renders complex bases too clumsy to traverse through. The controls are bad and the game does not take it into account. THere are about seven scenarios to play on, as the multiplayer function does not function. The economics of the game do not balance well with the game. One ALWAYS has enough money to just create the essential unit to win. You don't feel any difference between units or weapons (of course there are the obvious assualt rifles and shotguns, etc.). The game is really repetitive. In a few reviews of the game on Steam and on Youtube, there were mods in the workshop to fix all the above problems, however the only mods are extra factions, maps, or items. You can download all the mods you'd like, however, the vanilla game's loading times are already terrible, and are made significantly worse with mods."

If you are successful in combat, holding the breach from waves of enemies, do not be surprised when the climb the mountain of corpses and attack from above, or mine below the surface, digging the ground from underneath you.What makes this game even better are the loads of mods found on theDATAREALMS.COMforums, adding factions and hilarious weapons to the gameplay.Catch it on sale and do not miss this.

Somehow Nod had been able to kill off the Imperium of Man relatively early, although a contributing factor to their defeat was their strange compulsion to defend the tactically useless desert where their heavy units simply fell into the sand and were unable to retaliate.Playing as the United Aerospace Corporation I had the unique ability to deploy all troops and supplies to the field instantly through teleportation. This had worked in my favor until I found myself caught in between a firefight between Black Hand confessors and Combine Elites backed by several Hunters. The instant my forces were on the ground they were incinerated. My stubborness to admit defeat and simply wait for another opportunity to take the site got the best of me and my defenses were spread ridiculously thin. I had ended up taking the cliffsides but it was not even remotely worth the effort. I had an ample supply of brains to reclaim any territory that would be lost to the enemy, but no funds to supply them with backup and the ability to purchase new recruits. At the same time it was plain to see that with the Brotherhood of Nod sweeping across Combine territory and emerging victorious, they had no plans to halt their advance and give me time to save up the cash to produce an army powerful enough to turn the coming red tide. I had no choice but to perform an extremely stupid and desperate attack utilizing all the resources I had at that point against a single stronghold that Nod had dumped most of its cash in. If I could capture this territory I would kill off almost 50% of their units occupying the planet and also maybe gain the use of some Nod units as well.It was not going well at first, but then I massed a large group of minigunners and rifleman together on a high ground overlooking their main fortress. It was crawling with infantry and surrounded by turrets, but due to the sheer number of rounds I was throwing at them everything above the surface was slowly obliterated by an advancing swarm of lead death.Finally I was able to send in a modest amount of men armed with shotguns, chainguns and plasma rifles. I was slowly pushing their troops deeper and deeper into a retreat, forcing them to fall further back to the depths of their fortress, bottlenecking them. I had them. My initial strike force was getting weak, so I ordered them to continue onward without my direct interference. I produced another marine, this time armed with a BFG9000 and sent him in to finish the job. My men had managed to corner their brain at the very bottom of the base, but they were missing most of their legs and arms and couldn't land a shot. Their death would not be in vain. I fired the BFG directly at their brain and one second before it reached its target the game crashed.War is hell."

If some of the major issues get addressed, I'd be really excited to play, but at the moment I'm spending most of my time wanting to rip my hair out.  The idea of the game is REALLY cool, and yes, I had fun playing, but mostly it was an exercise in frustration.These are the major issues that I encountered:1. Broken 360 controller support. Buttons work, but not the sticks.2. Godawful frame rate at any resolution.3. Screen resolution options are terrible with anything other than native screen res. Smaller resolution in a window is very tiny, and going full-screen doesn't actually fill the screen, it just makes the same size ""window"" in a full-screen. That means lots of black with a still-tiny game in the middle.4. Fonts - anything smaller than native resolution (1680x1050 in my case) is unreadable.5. The aiming system is very difficult. Sometimes I get an aiming ""reticle"" so I can see where I'm aiming across the screen, but other times (even with the same gun) it's not there, which means you can't tell where you're aiming except to carefully watch the bullets.6. The jet-packs - after 2 hours of play-time, I still can't get my soldiers around using the jet-packs. Most of the time, they seem to barely budge my soldier off the ground. If a soldier gets stuck down a mine-shaft (or whatever), it takes so much time to get them back out that the rest of my squad is usually wiped out. Consequently, I end up leaving many squad members in useless positions and buying more."

You have no warning when you're being attacked at the other side of the map, you have no way of knowing which weapon you have equipped unless you know the ammo quantities and which weapon ""model"" is which. The tutorial is a single level with a half a dozen sign posts to tell you how to play on a game with considerable depth as this, that is not enough. The floor seems to melt away as you're walking on it resulting in getting stuck in the floor. There is no progression to show you which weapons are better than other or which bodies are more capable than others. You get given a list of several hundred buyable items and get no indication on which ones are worth buying. The campaign is simply a series of skirmishes with a shared resource pool. The graphics are mediocre, looking almost as though the whole game and all the assets are developed to play in 640 X 480, aiming is terrible and unintuitive, sometimes working and sometimes not, can we have an Aim button so we know when we're aiming or otherwise. Why can I not see any range of distance when aiming, often having to approximate the thing I'm aiming at but I can somehow see anywhere on the map when I'm choosing my delivery locations?Personally I think the game would have had a lot of potential, but in it's current state it almost seems like the thing is having an identity crisis, it's like the game doesn't know if it want's to be a strategy game or a 2d action platformer. I think I would prefer it if it was played entirely like an RTS game and I could just pause the action issue commands to my troops where to move and which direction to cover etc. For a game which has been in development for such a long time, it seems that the developers have had no clear direction and rather than ending up with a solid game, have instead ended up with a digital identity crisis."

Enviroment is completley destructable. Eventually some corridors will become to packed full of bodies and debris you need to send a skeleton with a light digger to let your troops advance.If a drop ship come in with fresh supplies, there is potential that if it's shot down, the flying debris will decapitate or just crush your men.

It has the tactical feel of  ""Should i send a squad of riflemen, or a All in One solution thats fragile?"", but when enemy drop pods start crushing your people and when one of your allies ""accidentaly"" shoots a RPG at a friendly dropship you know you are playing this the right way.But what makes it so great?Well then, sit down and let me tell you about the magic of a PHYSICS ENGINE in a 2D enviroment that is always fresh. You can literally use soldiers as a ballistic missile with C4 stuck on them, you can use a super heavy soldier withRocket Propelled Chainsawsto annihilate a squad of enemies while a dismembered, bleeding enemy with a pistol shoots at your back. You can not decline the satisfaction of firing grenades into a bunker and remotely detonating it.Anything else?Well of course. You have the steam workshop with many GREAT mods like Void Wanderer which entirely change the entire point of the game, some mods with OP factions like DsTech with flashy weaponry and high cost. Or maybe if you just wanna mess around Hueg pack of mods with quality content like a nuclear fridge or a walking gas canister.Pros:Provides endless funThe workshop provides quality contentThe physics engine keeps everything fresh and unpredictableFor the amount of particle movement and physics the optimitisation is EXTRAORDINARY goodEasy to mod, create content and overall costumisableIs even more fun in front of a TV with friendsCons:The AI isn`t anything special but can be challengingThe developers are a small, slow team but they still updateThe game is still a bit rough around the edges.All in all. This is one of the most under-rated games on steam that deserves more attention as it is unique and fun as hell.Really, if you can afford a couple of quid, pick this up right away."

,Not Recommended,209670,19444014,"Posted: 2 December, 2015",all,Nephilim,"I'm trying really hard to like this game, because it combines so many elements that I usually love: it's a sandbox (or rather box of toy soldiers) full of cool stuff with crazy physics, ragdoll soldiers, a totally destructible envirnoment... and yet somehow it seems to add up to less than the sum of its parts. Here are a list of some of my grievances:1) The controls, UI, menus etc are all very ropey and unintuitive. It takes a long time to get a basic grasp on stuff like the RMB command dial and the jetpacks for moving around, and the worst thing is almost nothing is explained to you, so you just have to persevere and figure it out. Now, I'm old enough that I grew up with games that were like this by deafault, but I think most modern gamers would find the lack of a proper tutorial inexcusable and annoying.2) The load time for the game is ridiculous; it's literally the longest-loading game I own by some distance. This game is a 90Mb download... how can it take longer to load than massive, graphics-intensive games? I feel like I haven't waited this long for a game to load since the days when I owned an Amiga 500!3) So many crashes, so much lag caused by too much stuff happening on screen. It crashes enough without mods, but with mods I can barely finish a scenario without an unexplained CTD or hang. Given the game's modding community is one of the things people praise about it, this seems prety unforgivable.4) Absolutely no story, nothing to work for, no progression. It even has a paltry 11 Steam achievements! I know it's a sandbox, but I feel like a structured campaign where you were slowly immersed in the game, unlocking weapons etc as you went, would make it a lot less overwhelming and keep you engaged for longer.5) Starts to feel very samey very quickly, despite the obvious diversity of units and weapons on offer.I'm only 7 hours in an debating whether I will put much more time into this, if I'm honest. I got it at 80% off and I guess I've had my £3 worth of entertainment from it already, but there's absolutely no way I could recommend this at full price. Pick it up on sale if you fancy messing around with it for a few hours, but don't expect a game that you'll love. It's a shame, as I really wanted to love it!"

I love the concept that combines real time strategy, shooting, and finance management. However, everything feels poorly executed.You move your units in the game using walking, which is painfully slow and a jetpack which has very little thrust and makes your character flop around like a piece of paper and get stuck on everything he touches, making it feel very awkward to move. Several times I've been powerless to defend my base because I couldn't move my units over a hill or wall to confront the enemy.The shooting is pretty well done, and I really like how your units' parts can be destroyed, leaving him disarmed, without legs, or blown apart across a large distance.The place where the game makes me feel most handicapped is when I am trying to order units. The menu UI works well enough, but selecting your units, their weapons, and the craft their delivered in takes too much time in the heat of battle, and there's no way to pause while doing it. Even when selecting preset units I feel much to slow, and usually you don't even get a chance to enforce your base with units before it gets attacked. So many times I've failed battles because I couldn't order units fast enough and was wiped off the planet by the AI without a fighting chance. Sometimes the unit delivery doesn't even work. For example, I ordered three preset units in a drop pod, the drop pod fell, broke through the ground and got stuck, and when it opened all my units' parts exploded out of it with their guns, the soldiers having been crushed to death.Overall the game feels very awkward and unfinished, but it can still be enjoyable. However, it is definitely not worth $20."

I really enjoyed this game a lot so far and pretty much love everything about it.  Definitely not the sort of gameplay for everyone, there is a blend of action and strategy.  The physics engine in this game is like nothing I have ever really seen before, and it is rather impressive.  Even more impressive is the devs next game engine already in the works.   You can make modifications for this game, and even your own totally custom levels with some additional programs.  The built in editor lets you easily remake the inlcuded maps.  I just wish it would not depend so heavily on the CPU because when action gets heavy this game can slow down quite a bit.  There are ways of getting around this though, tweaks to settings files and even the possibility to make modifications.  For me these tweaks seem to have fixed the issues mostly.Update:  This game still rocks IMO..  I'm really surprised it has such a low meta score, and that more people aren't digging it.  It has a ton of replayability, especially with all the awesome mods.  The ONLY thing I don't like about this game is that it runs poorly on my quad core because it isn't multithreaded, but the core engine was built a long time ago and would probably be a pain in the butt to redo.  So I can accept that, especially because it is still a lot of fun."

Updates are very infrequent, so despite it being early access, don't count on it becoming a finished game any time soon.Despite that, it's areally fun game.I can, and have, played the Bunker Breach game mode all day long.It's sort of like those classic tank games, where the terrain is made of little individual particles. However, in this game, everything is made of those little particles. For example, if you got a headshot on one of those orange Dummy robots, their head would fly off of their body. Depending on what you shot them with, it might stay intact and land on the ground, where it is now considered part of the terrain and can be further destroyed. Or, it might land on a rock and shatter into pieces. Or, you might have shot them with something like a giant laser, in which case you probably won't find any part of it at all.It's really in-depth with it's carnage and destruction, is what I'm getting at. Even the bullets are actual projectiles affected by physics- impact strength, ricochets, drop off. This is more noticeable in some weapons, like the Revolver Cannon, which fires chunks of metal a little smaller than a unit's head."

It most certainly has its problems and is generally still unpolished, but it is very playable and has taken a good chunk out of my life.It is however an incredibly hard to master game, you will spend alot of time trying to figure out certain things before actually being able to play it remotely well. This isn't nessicarly a bad thing because the complexity greatly makes up for it once you find out what kind of crazy things you can do, like loading up a crate with molotovs, just to hurl it from deepspace in order to completely incinerate your enemies.this game also has split screen multiplayer, which should be noted, sadly I however didn't really have the ability to try this out, mainly because I haven't been able to get my hands on another controller just yet.Take a good look at the game, and if this seems like your cup of tea, then go for it."

So I'm playing a game mode where I can only use one soldier. Said soldier is facing a swarming army of badies armed with only space mining tool things. Badie happens to drill half of my body off. However the loss of half my torso would not stop revenge from being mine. As a final act of protest I activate my jetpack to full power and slam myself into the engine of an enemy drop ship. This causes the ship to spin wildly out of control and slam into a huge group of badies on the ground. So in conclusion Cortex Command gives me chubs."

,Recommended,209670,28835733,"Posted: 30 December, 2016",all,Dave.,"I bought this game on September 30th, 2012, 2 days after it released on Steam, for $17.99.  Since then, I have watched the rating of it drop and watch as the game was dragged through the mud.  I have a tendancy to leave games for a while (especially early access), and try to finish all the games I have that are 'finished', so I can play through everything being complete.  Over the years as well, I have watched as it seemed this game was lost in the void of the oh so many games never coming to fruition for whatever reasons (owning some as well, of course).  It's pretty frustrating, however I played this game once, yup, One time, foralmostan hour, that's my actual playtime.  Yet after all the complaining, and the Steam refund system coming into full effect (which I have used), after thinking this game was lost, and such a small amount of time played, the time I did play, through all the rough edges, I could tell that I would enjoy this game, someday, when I got around to it.  It was only when I left another game today, December 30th, 2016, and became really confused to see Cortex Command at the bottom of my update list, I was happy to see they are not gone.  So here we are, 4 years later, sure it may be some time before I really sit down and get into it, I will say, it does have a certain charm about it, that I could not abandon after all that time, ..is the point.  *To be updated*"

,Recommended,209670,28828862,"Posted: 30 December, 2016",all,Corban,"Overall a kind of ""meh"" game. It has a lot of potential to be fun, but the issue is how opaque a lot of the features are. The tutorial covers the absolute bare minimum of moving around and shooting, and the basic objectives, but does not cover anything regarding the career mode such as base building or even turn structure. Get it while it's on sale. At $3, I definitely feel I got my money's worth, but it's not quite got enough polish to shell out the full asking price."

From the sheer insanity of large scale battles to the tactical precision of small engagements, the game is incredibly fun. While it is not complete, it is updated (sporadically) and each update adds content and enhancements that just make the game more and more worth it to buy. I absolutely recommend buying the game, and can see it becoming a cult classic in a few years."

Worth every penny and great fun with a few friends and some controllers - I'd even go as far as to say this is the best local multiplayer game available for PC and I own Crawl, Nidhog, and others. If you've ever played with army men, legos, and action figures when you were young and imagined massive, brutal, battles this game brings it to life. Build and defend massive underground bases with traps and fortified rooms or storm someone else's creation while they defend. The community mod list is massive and always growing. I actually find myself removing some from time to time because the amount of choices can be overwhelming."

There is a lot of potential for a game like this, will that ever be met I have no idea, but it's still amazing. This game can really become one of the only games you play. It's actually pretty ridiculous how much fun you can have. I assure you that this is an amazing investment. You'll play this game and say, ""Wow that's pretty neat. Kinda wish there was more to it though."" Guess what buddy. It has a brilliant community to and not to mention that community is a modding one.

,Recommended,209670,35489757,Posted: 5 October,all,Liquid Mantis,"Cortex Command is the equivelant of that game you used to play as kid with action figures. The sort of one where you mash two things together and one was ""defeated"". It's good fun, the modding scene is fairly strong and pretty much makes this game even though the Default units are still pretty good. Wanna see the imperium of man go up against the Combine Overwatch? This is your game. Want to drop giant mechs with mixed results onto a heavily fortified base? This is your game. The AI is fairly competent although you'll get the occassional ""DUHHHHH"" from any of the AI trying to mine or brain hunt.It's alot of fun besieging or being sieged, economically dumping crab bombs onto the surface to try and survive and killing yourself in process. It's a great game. I got this back when this was in the humble bundle but i still think the price point applies, it's good fun and i don't think you'll be disappointed.The jank on the controls is there and you need to circumvent it but it was never so much of a problem that it irritated me. It only really annoyed me when units didn't climb stairs or i needed to rely on the jetpack for any form of vertical movement. However, i managed to look past it but others haven't quite clearly."

Every time I remember this game I want to sit down and play with it but every time I find new bugs and it is really frustrating to play. Controllers sometimes work, I have no idea why they wont work but i have perfectly functional xbox controllers that the game simply doesnt recognise. The game says the right resolution but the resolution obviously isnt right because I am zoomed in to the op left corner of the screen. The Steam Workshop content is pretty good, I just wish I could get this game to work straight away when my friends come over.Personally the only fun gamemodes are wave defence and brain vs brain, but I wish I could save bases Ive built so I can re-use them (and not rebuild them every time)Overall ive probably spent more time searching forums and fiddling with settings and third party programs trying to get this game to work and getting frustrated over glitches than actually playing the game."
