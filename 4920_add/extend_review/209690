Compared to other tower defense games, Fieldrunners lacks a lot of depth. However, the main reason I cannot recommend this game is because it is just a lousy and lazy port from their mobile version. This game will not support 99.9% of today's widescreen monitors. If you do have a large monitor, the game will look pixelated and blurry. The developers will not fix this so please avoid at all costs!"

You have a field crossed by minions and must kill them all before they reach the other side of the map. You have diferent kind of towers (slow, rockets, laser, etc) and can block them so they have to go through the path you make.A really simple to learn game and quite fun if you like this kind of game. Worth the money."

76561198056049695,Recommended,209690,8207962,"Posted: 22 December, 2013",all,Penfold,I quite enjoy this simple tower defence game.  There is not a whole lot to this game but some of the levels are a lot of fun and the game gets difficult enough to keep you going for a little while.  I don't think this game will be to everyone's taste due to its simplicity but the graphics are fun and it makes for a fun break from playing more intense and complex games.

,Recommended,209690,8242876,"Posted: 23 December, 2013",all,Whiskey,"Fieldrunners is a no b.s tower defense game. Fieldrunners is ported from mobile devices which may turn off some but regardless of the platform there is fun to be had.Fieldrunners does well at respecting the player's time and ability. There is no tutorial to suffer though, there's no two hours of tedious ""intro levels"" to endure; you click ""start game"" and you better be prepared to play. Playing through on medium difficulty will provide the player with a respectable challenge.Fieldrunners is a bit simplistic and if you are expecting an experience like Defense Grid you will be disappointed, however if you generally enjoy tower defense games you will likely enjoy FieldrunnersScore: 7/10"

,Not Recommended,209690,8450510,"Posted: 30 December, 2013",all,StanleyPain,"Fieldrunners was a great iOS tower defense game (although probably the difficulty could use tweaking on some of the later maps), but it's hard to recommend the Steam version for the following reasons:1. The price was always ridiculed on iOS, especially when the devs refused to ever bring it down, even during holiday sales, despite the fact the extra maps were actually at one point DLC that had to be purchased.  Even including the DLC levels, $10 seems a bit off for a bare-bones PC version that doesn't function properly (more on that later) and has been a mega-success for going on 4 years or so now.   This barely rose to the $10 level on iOS, and it's not remotely a $10 on PC in this condition.2. The Steam version has a horrendous bug/glitch that the developers have yet to fix where mouse input becomes severely lagged after the second time you play it.  In other words, the first time you play it's fine, but after that the game is unplayable with virtually any form of mouse.  Touchpads on laptops tend to work, but some bizarre problem with the port causes serious issues with mice.  As of my writing this, this is not fixed.  The glitch does not seem to effect everyone, but it effects enough people that it's unfortunate it is not mentioned in the game description.Fieldrunners is a great, basic tower defense game, but this port is really shoddy and the shoulder shrugging response on fixing the bugs frankly makes me regret ever supporting these devs back before they made their fortunes on the Fieldrunners IP."

,Recommended,209690,16953391,"Posted: 8 July, 2015",all,Linguine,"I grabbed this game on sale for a dollar. After playing it for a while, I say it's worth it.It's a simple tower defense game. Build your towers, upgrade your defenses and make sure the enemys don't get through.Simple right? In a way, no. The game gets very difficult (at least for me) up to a certain point. Your game might start with some really strong guys running towards your base when you only have a couple of towers that don't do that much damage. Yet this usually depends on the difficulty you decide to play it on. The levels also look pretty nice too. Sometimes you might have to defend only one side and sometimes you have to defend 4 corners of the map. The game is mainly in 2D (Except the enemys) but looks quite nice. Each level feels different from the other one. One level you defend on a field, or you defend inside a large factory.The design of the enemys are interesting. I like the design of the characters. They remind me of the Soldier and the Heavy from Team Fortress 2. Sometimes I don't take the game seriously because I keep thinking a bunch of Heavys are trying to destroy my base.Overall, I give the game a 7/10 Mainly because I am not a big fan of tower defense games, but if you like tower defense games, then you might like it better than I do.They also have a mobile version of this game for the IOS and Android last time I checked."
