I do not understand why everyone seems to put this game down. If you configure the game (Not a separate program like someone stated) and set the controls correctly it works just great. It doesn’t crash, it doesn’t lag and it plays on windows 10 just fine. So, make this my first review, the games fine to play. So, go and Hack and Slash till you’re feeling good or bad or whatever."

,Not Recommended,209730,9670132,"Posted: 29 March, 2014",all,Daze The Bear Chieftain,"R.A.W. is a hack’n’slash RPG where you choose from the standard characters of warrior, dark sorcerer, or rogue. The four kings met in the North to fight back an ancient evil which is trying to come back. Only three made it out beaten and worn and the North King was frozen in crystal. This is where you come in and find the North King and he speaks to you telepathically asking for your help. He melds with your body and sets you on a task to open the four portals of north, south, east, and west lands.Playing the game isn’t bad it’s just not great. There isn’t much variety in enemies as you’ll fight mostly the same ones over and over which will become monotonous over time. Your weapons and armor don’t really make much of a difference in what you use. Basically you find a better one and it gives you a higher damage or defense. You can also have elemental damage of fire or poison to your weapons but those didn’t seem to add anything noticeable. Skills get added each level but none of them were that great or make me excited to level them up or unlock them.The story is pretty weak and didn’t really hold me or make me want to pay attention much. You’ll fight through the same levels or what seems like the same levels many times. Make it halfway through the game and then go back and do it all over again. Not too exciting if you ask me.Overall R.A.W. is a mediocre game which wasn’t bad to play but not worth playing more than once. Co-op may add a little fun to it but since I played it already by myself I don’t see the real reason to play it again unless you want all the achievements.Bear Rating: 6/10"
,Recommended,209730,2053423,"Posted: 6 September, 2013",all,Two Clicks,"BITESIZE:SIMILAR TO:Sacred, Paths of Exile, Titans Quest, Grim Dawn, Van HelsingWHAT TO EXPECT:Pretty graphics.  Linear but replayable levels.  Solid, if repetitive gameplay.  Limited character creation.  Decent range of skills.  Decent range of equippable items.ACHIEVEMENTS:ONE BROKEN. ONE GLITCHED.STATUS:COMPLETED.WHEN TO BUY:ONLY ON SALE.More info below....THE LOWDOWN:Realms of Ancient War is a solid if average ARPG set in a familiar style fantasy world.  Choose a character from: Warrior, Mage & Rogue.  Move through 26 or so replayable levels killing a variety of animal, humanoid and etheral/undead enemy types.  Face a few bosses and demi-bosses.  Perform limited sub-quests.  Gain experience to spend on a variety of unique upgradeable skills.  Equip characters with a variety of armor, weapons and jewelry.  Open chests.  Trade with a vendors for unwanted items to buy ones you do.  Get to the end of the level to make the next one available.  Rinse and repeat.THE GOOD:+ Solid KB/M controls.+ Simple well designed interface shows everything perfectly from quick slots and their associated hotkeys.+ Good inventory design with equipment slots and general area for other carried items.+ Use of Soul gemstones provide player lives.  Are great for average ARPGs like me.+ Levels can be replayed in any order to grind gold, experience and or items and purchase unique items at traders.THE BAD:- No manual saves.  Checkpoint locations and frequency is good though only reusable at certain times.- One broken achievement - Eternal Hero.  One glitched achievement - Critical Hit, requires Rogue character.- Coop achievement requires an Xbox compatible controller to gain.- Trader interface has no mass-sell option and is devoid of hotkeys making it tedious to use.- Only local coop is available but its stable.- Must be replayed 3 times; once with each class to get the final achievement.- No camera controls means fixed view.- Experience is limited to one character level per game level.  So once you get it dont expect to be able to farm xp on the same level.AND THE ORDINARY:* 3 standard archtype characters to play: Warrior, Rogue & Wizard.* Very basic level design.  Almost all maps are overly linear though.* 12 or so skill types for each character.  Can be upgrades three times each.  Pre-requistes required.* Pretty above average graphics.  But present a dark, sombre ambience which is perfect for the setting.* Okay selection of sounds gives action the proper audio impact.* Solid background music track that changes depending on the gameplay taking place.* Small but significant item economy with sporadic traders allows unique items and potions to be purchased.* Solid model animations.  Pretty and unique spell animations.* Stable on Win 7 Pro & Win 10.VERDICT:When compared against other games of its type, Realms of War is a solid if average to above-average ARPG.  Its gameplay feels very arcadey and repetitious but there is some tactical value in position, and repositioning your character and choosing the right ability at the right time.Its probably more suited to hardcore fans of the genre that dont mind taking a drop down from quality titles such as Grim Dawn, Titans Quest or the like.  In addition its virtially linear gameplay is perfect for casual players if played on easier difficulties especially given the simplisitic quest system.  Though the ability to replay levels over and over any time is great for grinding out extra gold and items if you need them.All aspects of game production are solid when evaluted together but overall the game is an unremarkable experience.  Note that the one broken achievement requires three playthroughs; one with each character type.  Its not the sort of game that I would want to play three times in a row.  My second playthrough as thief waited 4 years to be started.  However given the decent range of individual character abilities there is some scope for replayability.  Unfortunately the game is limited to local coop. I would imagine this game would be much more enjoyable played with a friend, sitting on a couch with some munchies nearby.You probably noticed that I used ""solid"" alot to describe many aspects of this title because all-in-all Realms of Ancient War is to generic for my liking.  Though it did kind of grow on me during my second playthrough when I wanted a brainless ARPG that wasnt too taxing.  I expect most gamers would find it quite bland and boring.  Which is why I would prefer to neither recommend or not recommend it.  If you are still interested I would suggest only getting it on sale and only if you really, really dont mind playing what is an average if well-made game.  If thats the case then dont expect too much and you wont be disappointed.  If you are a completionist stay away as you wont be able to complete achievement.  No support will be forthcoming as the developer is defunct.EDIT: Broken - Eternal Hero achievement may be glitched rather than broken.  Unverifed."

It has many flaws but it is not a bad game. The levels are mostly linear but the atmosphere is good. I finished the game with all 3 classes. The mage is way overpowered because you can win the game by spamming the fireball spell. It has the longest range, the highest damage, fastest attack rate and also area damage. I found the rogue to be the most challenging and fun to play. It is just mindless action. You can play a couple of levels per session because it becomes tedious.

,Not Recommended,209730,30564637,Posted: 17 March,all,jims9350,"The game looks quite nice, but that is it. I could not even make it to 90 minutes of play. It's just that bad. I played as the archer, though 90% of the time, I used her daggers. Mobs bum-rushing you makes the bow rather pointless. There seems to be little use for gold, except to buy health potions. It looked like I could get all the weapons and armor needed from drops. The two merchants I found had crap for sale. And the drops themselves made little sense. Five different sets of daggers had five different sets of stats - though the name of the daggers was exactly the same. Likewise with the training bow - same name, different stats. Armor had the most unispiring names I have seen in a game - ""blue leggings"", ""white leggings"", etc. Wow, I am excited to try all these colours! But wait, none of them actually changes the look of your character.Attacking is random and frustrating. At times I could hit the enemy with ease, and at other times, I had the cursor above the enemy and nothing was happening. Then suddenly, the game registered that I was doing something and I exploded with a huge strike, hitting every enemy around me.The AI is also pretty random. Most enemies will attack right away and, as other reviewers pointed out, from way off screen. Dwarves, however, seem to be particularly stupid. I could walk right up to them and they didn't notice me until I attacked.Finally, hilariously, I tried to attack spiders and dwarves from the opposite side of a gate from them. A gate with large gaps between the bars. My character turned to the side and shot arrows into thin air, never once aiming at the enemies. With that, I was done. Uninstalling and removing from my account. I wish to have no memory of this terrible game."

You actually control your character instead of pointing and clicking.  Much like Diablo 3, R.A.W suffers from it's genre more then it's quality.  These games have not advanced in over 10 years and all the hype in the world isn't going to fix that.  When a game stands out for not being a point and click in 2013....you know the genre is dead."

Otherwise, I wouldn't pay more than a couple bucks for it.I played on the top difficulty setting, and it really doesn't make the game ""difficult"".  The beginning is annoying because you get swarmed by immense amounts of enemies before you get crowd control abilities, but once you do, it's a piece of cake (even though they literally pop out of thin air which is a stupid spawn mechanic).The possession ability is keyed to wheel-click which is stupid.  A lot of mice don't even have good wheel clicking.Focus skills don't seem to work.Leveling up is basically capped to one character level per game level.  You still gain experience, but it's not at the same pace as the first level you gain.Story is dry and typical.  Game length is short.Outrightly plagarizes from other series such as Lord of the Rings with Legolas and Ents, and Baldur's Gate.All and all... meh out of 10."

It may not be the next Diablo, but so what? It's still very enjoyable! In my opoinion, the experience is much better with a controller (I use an Xbox 360), movement is smooth and combat responsive in a way the keyboard & mouse can't quite match. This is definitely an action-oriented game, not a more literary or strategy-minded RPG - and that's one of the things I like about it. Sometimes you just want to bash hell out of stuff! The graphics are better than many of the other reviews here indicate, but anyway these days the graphical presentation of any one game is such an incredibly subjective thing that as long as a game runs smooth visually, that's what is really important. And RAW does. The environments are detailed, the atmosphere is well-crafted, and the overall look of the world is consistent. Oh, and the lighting is very nicely done as well!

Though i cannot say its a great game... its not horrible either. Its worth buying on sale when it goes really cheap and will give a bit of intertainment.I find the enviromental graphics quite nice and appealing, nice landscapes/dungeons. And its not buggy or anything; just not well designed in some places (like no tooltips on items; you have to click on the item to have info show up in a section at the bottom). These missing UI features are a little anoying because they usualy aren't the most complex thing to code, but at the same time, they aren't bugs or issues."

,Recommended,209730,8180311,"Posted: 21 December, 2013",all,svorenson,"This is a rather basic action RPG, which I enjoyed playing with a gamepad (I have no idea how it plays with a keyboard and mouse.) The actions map very well to the controller, and auto targetting of ranged attacks avoids frustration. As a matter of fact, general combat and maneuvering are what kept me playing. If you need to have deep customizable builds on your action RPGs (e.g. Torchlight II), you may want to pass on this one. The skill trees do not allow for really varied builds and the random items are uninspired (yay, an item called 'purple hat' or 'orange chain mail' with minor bonuses to stats...)It seems that this game was designed to be played co-op, and in my opinion the Wizard is the most viable if playing solo. Still, you have to be very careful of the frequent ambushes of mobs that spawn out of nowhere, often surrounding your character. By the middle of the game I had configured a ""panic mode"" alternate set of skills just to handle these situations.The 'possession' mechanic adds some novelty, effectively allowing the character to change into a monster for a while. I wish it was explored as a general mechanic throughout the game, rather than used mostly in specific spots.Visually, I found the game to be satisfactory, with varied environments, and decent visual effects and animations. The background music did not draw my attention, for better or worse.To sum it up: I would recommend this for someone looking for a quick fix of action-RPG (mostly action) that can be played with a gamepad, preferably if it can be picked up on a sale."

The combat was endless button mashing, no combos or anything out of the ordinary to make it intersting. Just the same taping of the same damn button i found it to be very dull combat wise. A lot of endless taping. The story line was by far the lamest thing ive ever seen. Mobs and sounds were over used. No voice acting. Music was not vibrant enough for the areas. Gear skins were horrible and basic, changes were very small in appearnce. Storylines per character didn't differ at all, so over all No replay value... So Why play more then once? Oh and Co-op split screen blows.. You can't save in Co-op and theres no online services. The only thing positive i will say is the graphics were ""fair""."

,Recommended,209730,10986699,"Posted: 30 June, 2014",all,CaptnPanda,"R.A.W is a very simplistic version of popular hack/slash action RPGS like Diablo.It's simple, the skills are nothing to get exicted about and the gamplay is literally click and kite as much as the game alows. Mobs will body block you resulting in some "" really? "" deaths. Cleared out a room to prepare for a elite or boss? The mobs will spawn behind you so hopefully you can hack/slash through those so they don't body block you while you kite the elite mob.What's the story? Oh right four guys got together and somehow three of them escaped easily while they tripped and left behind the fourth guy so he ended up traped in crystal. Don't worry though he's speaking to you telepathically randomly to inform you that "" Oh that's a dead end better go around into more mobs "" You have to fight through the other three realms to free him in the fourth. Enjoy your quest Hero.Joking aside I actually really enjoyed this game. It's simplicity and clunky game mechanics made it so I was always trying the kite huge mobs under the worst circumstances and I didn't have to spend hours reading up on skills or stats on armor in order to midmax. I just played it put on whatever upped my damage minimally. Buy it on sale. Worth the $3 and enjoy that every chest spawns a huge mob right on top of you!"

It comes down to what you are looking for.  I was looking for a fun hack'n'slash style game with rpg elements.  There is a ton of loot to collect and I almost always had some awesome piece of armor or an amazing weapon that I was waiting to be able to use in my inventory.  This makes you want to level up more so you can use the equipment you've been gathering.  The skills are really fun too!  Other reviews stated that there is no real strategy, just mashing buttons.  For me, I would disagree.  There is some strategy here, but not so much as to frustrate you.  Overall, I really enjoyed the game and look forward to another playthrough with a different character."

I personally have nothing good to say at all about this game.1: There was no option for me to select the other chracters besides the wizard. A bug, glitch, whatever... Restarting the game didn't even fix the problem. Only solution to this is finishing the game to find out, but that isn't going to happen.2: I'm playing on the keyboard, and my Left-mouse button is my ranged attack as defult... Why the hell is my character just running up to the enemy to shoot it at point blank? Most of the time, my guy would just walk to the enemy and do nothing! I'm not even going to give a controller a chance.3: Only 1 level gain per level?! Bull crap...4: Hit boxes... for the love of god this game has horrible hit boxes! Main issue is with targeting enemies and projectiles from enemies.5: The UI is horrible. If I'm using a mouse to move in this game, the UI needs to be disabled from accidental clicks with the mouse.6: Side quests are a bit pointless when it felt like you had to do them just to finish the level. It might just be me, but it felt that way.7: Equipment... If I'm playing the wizard class, why am I getting gear for other classes?8: Sound clips: I don't know what the heck was making the sound, but I had to take my headset off because of the constant sounds of ""slurping/sucking"" sounds during the forest levels. Headset: PX4 Turtle Beach.Go play, ""The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing."" I don't care if Van Helsing was made after R.A.W."
