,Recommended,209790,24033019,"Posted: 2 July, 2016",all,YellowLab,"Splice is an interesting puzzle game. It isn't groundbreaking; however, everything about it screams original. Without giving too much away (there is not an instruction manual - part of the joy is discovering how it works), the game is to arrange cell parts (?) into a set orientation by moving the pieces. Each puzzle has a set number of moves (splices) that you can make. Then to top it off, there are some puzzles that have ""angelic"" solutions. These are denoted by a ""jingle"" playing when you open them and the ""Splice"" logo flashing in the corner. These puzzles can be solved in less than the given number of moves for an ""angelic"" solution.The first part of the game has seven sequences, with each sequence having seven strands. Forty-nine puzzles; twenty-five have angelic solutions. Then the fun really begins. There are four epilogue sequences with seven strands each. Twenty-eight more puzzles; eighteen of them angelic. These are much more complex and almost seemingly not possible. But they all can be done, and all the angelic solutions do exist.As I said, the game is not groundbreaking but screams originality. The interface is extremely elegant and functional. It does yell out for a tablet conversion. The ambient music is fantastic. This is a great game to check out if you love puzzle games."

,Recommended,209790,13955058,"Posted: 12 January, 2015",all,Tentacle-Kitty,"Splice is definitely a braintease of a game. It will require you to think hard about how to solve the strands presented, and if you want to really get to the full potential of the angelic strands, you'll have to think even more about it.The biggest challenge about Splice is the way the strands change appearance by just changing one litte aspect. You'll have to watch out for how you will change the appearance of the strand, and how the special parts of the strand will change with a right click.This is definitely a puzzle game with quite a bit of a challenge. I recommend getting this game if you're really into trying to find the optimal solution for every single puzzle encountered."

You go through strands in various sequences, starting from forgivingly easy to mindwreckingly hard.Secrets inclusive! Do you have what it takes to push the boundaries even more? Angelic splicing is the key!GraphicsThe visual design of the game is surprisingly astonishing with awesome animations and an overall beautiful visual design.Sound & MusicThe piano soundtrack of the game fittingly underlines the beauty of the game, even if it can get repetitive, if you play for too long (which you will, this is a puzzle game, duh).WeakpointsI deemed some of the puzzles way harder than others, some are simple realignments, some felt like thinking around 4 corners ahead (given the same difficulty level). Mixed difficulty is ok, but some puzzles who were not far away from each other, in terms of sequence, really made my head spin.No Options within the game. You cannot turn down the volume in the game.The tutorial section of the game falls really short and is pretty shallow, I got the hang of the game after the first sequence. If you still need help even after trying everything you could, seek help in the forums.Concluding ThoughtsBeautiful game, both visually and auditory. Mixed difficulty on puzzles. Secrets and extra content inclusive. Garanteed Content for over 6 hours.Modern DNA-Testing? 149€.

The concept is relatively simple, fill in the outline of each cell line with your individual cells which propogate either 1 or 2 children.  The game has very attractive graphics and an average ambient piano music to complement it.  Both the Steam Overlay and widescreen modes are also natively supported.  Unfortunately, Splice is marred by the lack of a tutorial, presenting you with new cell types without telling you how to interact with them or what they do.  The result is a frustrating experience of trial and error with a difficulty level that has sharp peaks and valleys.  While I was able to easily complete the first stage, by the second stage I was presented with puzzles that I absolutely could not figure out.  Had the game done a better job of explaining how to  play I probably would have gotten more enjoyment out of it.  As it stands, Splice is an attractive but flawed title."

The rules made no sense until at least two sequences in, when I finally begin to suss out how things work.  As a result, what could have been an interesting and beautiful puzzle game is instead a brutal, frustrating slog.  Imademyself play. By the time I finally found myself with a solid grasp of the mechanics, any puzzle that took me more than a couple tries to finish would end in either a ragequit or a solutions guide.When this game is good it's very good, but I'm so soured on it I can't even bring myself to create a ""Beginner's Guide to Splice."""

The concept is interesting, the graphics and music are lovely, and once you've figured out what the goal is, the puzzles can be a little challenging.  My biggest complaint is that the game seems to short, and, as other have said, the bonus levels feel like where the real game begins, as most of the other levels are building up to one large puzzle, teaching you each step one at a time.  Other than the shortness, I really enjoyed playing through.  A good one to save for a sale day.Recommended for:  casual puzzle gamers, especially those who want to try something a little outside the usual format.Don't do it if:  you really want a brain-wracker of a puzzle (Splice's are usually pretty straightforward, once you figure out the basic moves), you need more than an hour or two of gameplay to justify paying for a game (as there's not yet a randomly generated puzzle feature, so once you've done all the puzzles there's not any ongoing challenge to come back to)."

Toggling full-screen via the window manager should cause it to adjust accordingly, but no, it ignores window resizing (despite the window being resized as a result)…There does appear to be a built-in full-screen toggle (I usually just use the toggle provided by the window manager), but even with the game ‘properly’ in windowed mode, it doesn't even allow me to resize the window so that it actually fits on one monitor.This is utterly broken behaviour.(They know about the problem now; it may yet be fixed.)"

Aside from the few ""potential angelic"" levels (ones where it's possible to solve with less than the allocated splices, which may take redoing that specific level a time or two), and a few sticky ones that can be frustrating, you'll just blitz through in a few hours and shelve it. That said, it's engrossing, and you will easily lose those few hours in one sitting before wondering who fiddled with your clock.It does have a tendency to dump you in the deep end: there's no tutorial, and new specials are simply dropped on the first strand of each sequence so it can be frustrating simply not knowing the tools to solve it rather than due to the puzzle's difficulty. That's especially true with the first special where you're not told to right-click to activate when you've been drag-dropping before, or when you first get two specials at once and have to intuit that the slightly shinier one will go first regardless of where you click. However, there's a finite number of specials, and only drag-drop and right-click as controls, so it's doable, just would be nicer with a wee pop-up first time to say ""hey, do X and Y happens!"" to make it a little smoother.The graphics are pretty, and incredibly smooth for what it is. I do also like how uncluttered the screen is so there's nothing to distract from the puzzle at hand. The music and effects sounds, similarly, are non-invasive: nothing spectacular, but they're inoffensive and relaxing - and if I'm honest a little bit hypnotic, which feeds into the ""I can't leave my chair until I do just one more strand"" aspect of it - without being too elevator-muzak-y. Suits the game perfectly.Only glitch I've found is that it does not like windowed mode, in fact none of the graphics show up so you just get a background, tinkly music, and bloops as you click blindly at the ninja-genes. Annoying, but not game-breaking, as long as you, y'know, play in not-windowed mode. To be honest, it's that enthralling that you won't really want to be tabbing out, it really is, despite those few niggles, a one-sitting-playthrough kind of addictive."
