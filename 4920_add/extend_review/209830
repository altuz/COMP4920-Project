Although the pacing can be a little slow at times when you're trying to discover what to do next, the game offers interesting puzzles and combat that requires you to be tactical, in a sense.The music for the game is incredibly catchy, but also quite dark, and goes perfectly with the game's dark theme and humour.Despite being only 8-bit, this game could be considered better than some big-budget that currently exist.I'd recommend this game to anyone who is in the mood for a retro psychological horror, or loves games that carry dark-underlying themes and immersive storylines."

I also do not want to disregard the writing in this game either. The creator managed to meaningful dialogue within the game without over doing it and without being corny.The retro pixel art is outstanding. The pacing can suffer a little from time to time as you wander around looking for what to do next. But aside from that, I enjoyed gradually making my way through the 7 hour campaign. The enemies are not found in abundance or varied but all placed with thought behind the room design. That and other attention to detail show me the the developer who made this game truely cared about what he was making.If you are in the mood for a retro survival horror game you probably won't do better than this."

The Lone Survivor.'You__________________________________________Introduction'Lone Survivor: The Director’s Cut' is one of these little games that shows how good indie titles can be.This little pixelated horror adventure suceeds where many huge (Horror-)AAA-titles fail nowadays: Creating a deep and atmospheric experience full of creepy and mysterious situations without relying too much on (cheap) tricks like e.g. jumps scares behind every corner.After the outbreak of an unknown disease the nameless protagonist – only called 'You' – tries to survive in this harsh and cruel world. He lives withdrawn in a lost apartment building, unsure if he is still sane or if everything he sees is only a hallucination. Due to the questionable mental stability and the omnipresent problem of starvation he doesn't know how long he may be able to stay alive. First of alll 'You' doesn’t want to die alone – therefore he starts exploring the apartments and looking for other survivors of the catastrophe.While exploring the remnants of the 'good old times', 'You' will be confrontend with deep fears and mysterious situations, monsters and hallucinations, unsure what is real and what is just a trick of his own mind. Armed with a flaslight, batteries and a gun with very limited ammunition he makes his way into the unknown depths of the apartments, facing mysterious horrors while trying to keep the rest of his sanity and finding enough food to eat and time to sleep. The only 'true‘ friends he has in this apocalyptic world are a plant and a plush doll – but is it really a sign of sanity to talk to them? Who knows…The story is short but well done and the dialogues make you actually care about the characters, their well-being and their behavior, questioning the situations that 'You' has to face in and what’s really happening in front of him as everything may change in the blink of an eye. And in the end every step and decision you‘ve taken may affect him.Until 'You' will see the end of his journey it will take approximately four up to maybe five hours (I finished the game already two times outside of Steam, therefore my short gaming time is no sign of lacking experience). Fortunately the replay value is quite high due to many different endings based on your choices during 'You‘s' journey and a NG+ Mode with some additional content.__________________________________________Graphics and AudioTo cut it short: It’s a pixelated game based on Flash Engine so you shouldn’t expect toomuch – but for this it does quite a good job. The games‘ soundtrack is fantastic and fits most of the times absolutely perfect. It’s creepy and catchy at the same time, giving you the chills in the right moments.The pixelated graphics are well done and you can see that the different appartmens, rooms and scenes were crafted carefully and with a love for details. The game feels like a great trip in good old 2D-Horror Games and has a deeper atmosphere than many huge titles nowadays.__________________________________________ConsUnfortunately 'Lone Survivor' somehow feels bulky and using the inventory or selecting items can be quite annoying from time to time (just as using your gun in my opinion). The controls aren’t very comfortable despite some hotkeys, remapping them isn‘t possible and due to the restrictions of flash games there is no easy solution for controller support aside from third party software – a fact where the game would benefit from heavily. That’s kind of sad as the PS3-version has both controller support and achievements (that are somehow missing in the PC version).__________________________________________ConclusionThis game may give you the chills while taking you on a little journey about sanity, surviving and the horrors that are hiding either in the shadows or in your own mind. Sure, it has some flaws and edges but the overall experience is intense and it suceeds in creating a deep and nice atmosphere when 'You' tries to hide from the strange creatures or faces them – realizing that he’s actually out of ammunition. Moreover it has a brilliant soundtrack. Seriously.I’d rate it 9 out of 10 points and definitely recommend the game - it's worth the money, even without a sale.This endorsement approved byThe Reviewers' Union, providing better standards for reviews and reviewers."
,Not Recommended,209830,8629083,"Posted: 8 January, 2014",all,OZWA,"Lone Survivor is a difficult game to reccommend.  I've been hearing good things about it from friends and various sources since its release, and I tried to play it when the Director's Cut edition first came out -- but it did little to hold my attention and subsequently collected pixelated dust for months and months. A few days ago, I forced myself to play it again at the behest of a friend who was convinced I was robbing myself of an amazing experience.  While I wouldn't call the experience 'amazing', I don't consider it a terrible one.  Lone Survivor is a game that has its moments of brilliance, but all too often this brilliance is marred by mechanics, lazy dialogue, and design theory.The GoodWe'll begin with what Lone Survivor has in its favor. Lone Survivor features a cohesive aesthetic, a persistent, chilling atmosphere, an engaging, apposite soundtrack and good pacing/length.The Aesthetic:The aesthetic design in this game is tight, cohesive, and remains this way throughout the entire playthrough.  Environments are detailed and fit nicely next to character models.  Characters are semi-detailed sprites, and all are animated well.  The Man Who Wears a Box was especially well rendered.  Enemies and corrupted environments are visceral and exploding with gore. There's nothing that stood out as exceptional to me in Lone Survivor's aesthetic, except for one: The text is presented in absurdly low-quality.  Reading it was a bit of a struggle at first, and even when I was used to it it was still ugly and strained my eyes.  I understand the intention behind the font, but readability need not be sacrificed in a retro font.Sound DesignLone Survivor's sound design is possibly its best feature.  Sound effects are harsh, untempered, and low quality, which help augment the visceral nature of the environment around the player.  Monster screeches sound more like white noise and synthetically generated wave forms rather than actual grunts and gutteral groans, and I believe this helps add to Lone Survivor's unique atmosphere.Lone Survivor also has an apposite soundtrack that enhances the gameplay and conflates with the environment and atmosphere.  I find that many sountracks either don't do enough to augment the atmosphere of a game, or they are too zealous and begin to drown out other elements.  This one fits nicely somewhere in the middle.Pacing // Game Length:The game's pacing is quite good as well -- things develop at a satisfying rate, and the game doesn't hang on one section too long nor fill itself with useless padding; while at the same time still offering those who wish for an extended stay side-quests and multiple endings.The BadLone Survivor seems to work hard to make itself a very neutral experience -- for every good design decision or execution, there seems to be a poor one following closely in its wake.  Lone Suvivor suffers from sluggish mechanics, a rather banal pool of enemies, a narrative that is just a little too self-conscious of its esoteric nature, uninspired dialogue, and an underdeveloped character cast.Mechanics:Perhaps the most crucial flaw in Lone Survivor lies within its game mechanics.  Controls are clunky and there seems to be a slight input delay for most actions -- for instance, many times I would take an extra, undeserved hit from an enemy when using the flare hotkey due to the delay.  Combat is simple, basic, and unengaging.  Players are given the option to avoid combat using the stealth 'system' (if you can call it a system -- hit X to hide in pre-designated spaces, then hit X to unhide), but this is equally dull and boring.  There's an elaborate cooking system, but I also found this to be unengaging.  Food heals the protagonist as well as boosts his mental health, one of the metrics used to determine which ending you get.  Nothing's broken, but it's not ideal either.  Everything works and functions at an acceptable level, but nothing is compelling.  Because the game's mechanics were so prosaic, I felt absolutely no want nor desire to play the game based on them alone.  That meant that the narrative and characters had to do some heavy lifting -- which they didn't quite do, as we'll discuss in a moment.  To summarize:  Aside from the frustrating input delay and clunky controls, the mechanics work in this game.  They're just too basic or too dull to make for a fun or engaging experience.  I think many might argue that these clunky controls build tension in the game , as many other survival horror games have similar setups.  Yet that's an argument without weight, and one that excuses lazy or lackluster development strategies.  Tension could (or should) still be maintained regardless of the control setup.  Limiting a player's options is an acceptable strategy to build tension, but the options that remain available should be fluid, entertaining, and satisfying.Narrative, Dialogue, and the Cast:Lone Survivor thrusts you into its narrativein media res, but then does very little to supply the player with the backstory.  There are a few mentions by characters that hint at the past, but specifics are almost non-existent.  In fact, vague ambiguity is the main problem with the narrative: It's presented to the player as a large mystery to be solved, yet frustratingly little is resolved in the end.  It's a narrative that seems rife with potential and one that, unfortunately, instead only delivers minimal emotional impact.  Characters aren't given enough time nor dialogue to develop into something the player will actually care about.  And about the dialogue -- it's very hit or miss.  Sometimes it's fitting and poignant and interesting.  Other times it's tacky, too colloquial, or entirely too self-aware of its attempts to unsettle the player.  Many of the character developments and dialogue just feel like cheap, thoughtless shots that are meant to add tension.  For some, this might work.  For me, this only served to pull me further out of the world.Lack of Motivation:Tying all of these other issues together severly limited my motivation to finish the game.  There are mysteries (in theory) to discover, but there's so little information given to the player that I had little interest in solving them.  There are characters with which to interact, but I had no reason to care about them and felt no connection.  I felt rather insulted by the cheap shots in the dialogue with regards to generating 'tension' or 'suspense'.  I felt bored with the fact that there were only a couple of enemies that appeared throughout the entire game, and that all of them featured very predictable AI patterns.  There were only a couple of bosses, and both of those fights were inane and unimaginative.  In short, I had to force myself to finish the game. There are multiple endings, but I felt no want or desire to put the effort in to see the others (I did research them, however).The GestaltThose who enjoyed the game and reccommended it to me argued against my complaints and averred that it was the gestalt of Lone Survivor and its experience that caused it to transcend its flaws.  From my perspective, this isn't a valid argument.  Something must carry the weight in order to deliver an excellent experience, and I don't see any element doing this in Lone Survivor. Lone Survivor isn't a terrible game, it's just a boring, unresolved one.So there it is. If you feel that Lone Survivor is still something that interests you after reading my complaints, pick it up and form your own opinions about it.  However, if you want a truly compelling survival horror game that delivers both stellar gameplay and a fascinating, coherent narrative -- look elsewhere."

Its strength lies in its ability to make you wonder just what the hell is going on. It plays on the fear of the unknown, I'd say.

It got the thing that made Silent Hill 2 and IMSCARED Great.The main character is a nameless person and seems like he doesn't care for anything, not even his life. But he have a past and through the game you might get an idea of what the story is about if you took a close look. you will start to wonder if anything is real or if he just imagining everything because of his loneliness and depression, he's not crazy by any means but I think the game is symbolic for how he feel inside.There is a lot of optional quests to do in the game, but by the time you beat the game you will realise you haven't done a single quest, you will be lucky if you at least finished one quest. You will eventually know about the thing you missed after you finished your first run.The game is difficult because of the rarity of the bullets and batterys. I had to start the game from the beginning multiple times because I lost a lot of them and they are necessary to progress through the game.The Atmosphere in the game is one of the strongest in any video game I've ever played in my life. the soundtrack alone will give you the scares. I'll say the OST alone is enough reason to play the game. The game has one of the best soundtrack in all of video game history, It's not a surprise since the Composer/Designer is Jaspert Byrne, the same guy who made some of the music in Hotline Miami 1&2.The pixel art in the game is foggy and gloomy in the best possible way which helps the atmosphere and make it stronger.The game has ZERO Jumpscare which make the horror real and much more effective.You also have a sanity and a hunger meter that you can't see it but you can take care of it by taking care of the Lone Survivor by giving him food and letting him sleep when it's nesasary, but be careful for the food is rare and sleeping (or the lack of it) will have an effect on the ending you will get.There is Multiple Endings to the game but there is no Good or Bad ending, it's all about the things you see and how you take care of The Lone survivor.I won't spoile to much of the game I already said enough.All in All, the game is nothing short of a masterpiece and you can tell it was made with love and Jasper really loved survivor Horror games. It's heavily inspired by Silent Hill 2 and that's not a bad thing at all, the game gose for the old school survivor Horror rots and that's the best thing about it. You will enjoy the game especially if you like horror games or games that tells a surreal story in general.Definitely Play it       10/10"

,Recommended,209830,14024920,"Posted: 16 January, 2015",all,Big Gulp,"This is still one of my favorite games ever. Is it sometimes reminiscent of Silent Hill? Absolutely. Does it feel like a clone? Not in the slightest. Does asking rhetorical questions make me feel like a phony? You betcha.Those looking to get the game for action-packed fights, or even more than one weapon, are going to be disappointed. The game is more about exploration and, in later playthroughs, taking care of yourself.The game sort of draws you in initially by seeming like your typical survival horror game, only pixelated and with really cool atmosphere. While it still does have really cool atmosphere, it becomes obvious very quickly that the story of this game is about more than just a zombie outbreak or whatever. In lots of ways, you could argue that all of that side of the game is just metaphorical anyway. While I wouldn't be able to confidently explain all aspects of the story, I can see some pretty touching themes about coping with loss, as well as free will vs. fate: Do you have the courage to keep moving on after loss, or will you just stagnate? Will you take your future into your own hands, or will you give in to what you believe is your ""true"" nature?The choices you make affect the ending of the game, and if you're anything like most people who have spent their lives being conditioned by videogames, you will get a pretty bad ending on your first try, which is in part due to the fact that killing enemies counts against your mental score. The idea of NOT killing living things in a survival horror game is going to feel very foreign, and sometimes, you're going to need to really work your brain to figure ways around conflict. It's really neat trying to find the ""good"" way to handle enemies rather than taking a gun to them, which the game clearly implicates as being the easy way out. It wants you to show some of the most powerful traits that human beings possess: resilience and compassion.In more direct terms of things, the game's just fun to look at, play, and listen to. Most of the time any item you pick up is going to be something unique. There are so many food items, and it's fun to try them out and see how the main character likes them. There's even some stuff with cooking later on, or other things you can do with the food. Sprites are all really well done. Music (or atmospheric sound) is always spot on. The game also keeps tossing in new twists or things to do and it never really gets old, despite never giving you more than one kind of gun (WHOA!).I guess that's about it. Some say the main character is kind of whiny, but I don't think those people really fully appreciate the kind of situation this guy is in, or for how long he's been in it. It's a cool game with a cool story and if you've gone through some kind of painful loss, there are definitely things that you could relate to in it. The creator, Jasper Byrne, is also a super cool guy who has even responded to emails I've sent him. Mr. Byrne, if for some reason you read this, hello, and I have bought three versions of this game. I'd love to see more like it."

And while the idea of a lone guy in an apocalyptic world with zombie-like-monsters is seen too many times already, I would like to point out that that is not the highlight of the game. The highlight of the game is the sanity of our character, and thereby your sanity. The things that happen in this game are illogical (even by psychological game standards), and it hints at the story outside of our character's head. You will find yourself questioning most of what happens in this game like:Is there really an apocalypse?Is the characters you stumble across people from our protagonist's life or just reflections of his own mind?And what is up with that ending? (No matter what ending you get, this one counts).To top that off I think that the art style is wonderful, the controls are nice and the soundtrack is plain up amazing.I will say that your hunger and sleep meter could have been presented better than just the game spamming you with messages, but all in all I love this game.

But it's also got an adolescent bent to it, and as with Silent Hill 2, its fear comes from the psychological underpinnings of its protagonist.Extraordinarily tense and beautiful to look at, Lone Survivor is at times alternately terrifying, puzzling and touching, and above all else it's fun. It's a game that's fun to play, fun to talk about, fun to figure out.You won't always know what's going on, even after the credits roll, but you get the idea that the creator and characters do. You get a sense of complete world, much of it outside the frame. So I call it a success. Play this."

Than you will love that game.It's very clear, that the game was highly inspired by the Silent Hill series. Setting, monsters, atmosphere, - all that has definitely come from there, You might say, that it was a bad decision, just to take the idea from one game and to apply it in another, but it was not the case, really. Because this time it was not about to take and to apply, it was about adding something very new in genre.GraphicsThere is nothing special about the graphics here. A very popular way of decorating - 2D-pixel one was used here. If you are not a huge indie-game fan, that might be a little problem at first, but then you will get used to it and realise that this was the best type of graphic that could be used in the game - because there are a few details in the game that your imagination creates, your own vision of the protagonist, the people he contacts with, the monsters - just as book does.Sound and musicEven here it is easy to identify that the game was inspired by Silent Hill. Some in-game sounds are very similar to the ones you have heard in the SIlent Hill series. However, sounds here are great and it is impossible to say that they are bad or too cheap.The music here is a pure masterpiece. Inspired by Akira Yamaoki's guitars and synths, that multi-genre soundtrack will stuck on your MP3-player for the next 2 months. From melancholic guitar to a disturbing noise - you can find here everything you loved in Akira Yamaoka's soundtrack.Gameplay""Lone Survivor"" is a 2D-survival horror. You have to move from left side of screen to the right one and back. There will be monsters so you have to face and shoot them or just go behind them. You can pass the game without even shooting to monsters. However, gameplay is not something revolutionary here, but, in this case, it is an advantage, because it helps you to concentrate on setting and on storyline.Setting and storylineAs I have said it above, the setting is truly inspired by Silent Hill, and here it seems as a briliant idea. All the details from there are realised well. In fact, they were set in the game as the creator of it had worked on a original Silent Hill game. There is nothing that might be unnecessary, every detail, every word, every event - all these are truly on its places.The storyline is good too. All the human characters are very interesting and it is exciting to see how they react on the protagonist and how protagonist reacts on them. There are 3 endings depend on the way you play, so it is more interesting to complete the game again in order to see the rest endings after you finished ""Lone Survivor"" once.ConclusionThe game creates a very special effect on you. After the game, you would feel yourself as you've just finished one of the Silent Hill games. Was it a hero's dream? Or was it for real there? The answer is up to you, because there are a lot of facts for and against it.All in all, the game is worth its money. If you are still thinking whether you should buy it, I would say: buy it. ""Lone Survivor"" is not a very long game, so you do not have to play in it for days, but the time you spend here will be unforgetable."

My curiosity got the best of me and decided to give it a shot because the game claims to be a survival horror. But in 2D? That’s just crazy.After playing and completing the game, I can officially say that Lone Survivor is nothing short of a masterpiece and I don’t use that term lightly especially when it comes to a survival horror/adventure game. The game can be easily summed up as a Silent Hill 2 2D side scrolling game. So does that mean is it scary? I wouldn’t go down that line but more like psychology creepy. Because you don’t know what is real or not and yet you have to deal with weird looking monster by either shooting them, distracting them or hide out of plain sight just to pass by them.The game creator Jasper Byrne has really put a lot of effort by taking the 16 bit graphics and turning it into something special. The added mosaic textures and grainy effects makes this game visually stunning. Not to mention that he has created an original soundtrack specifically for this game that will sink into your ear holes and brain waves as soon as you run the game. Its games like this make me appreciate Indie games a lot more than big publisher companies that make AAA games like Capcom or Konami who have completely lost their roots to what made their own original survival horror  games a legend.If you're a true survivor horror adventure fan, give this game a go. You will not be disappointed.*TRVIA*--- Jasper Byrne also has some of his original soundtracks in Hotline Miami which was nominated as Game Of The Year of 2012."

""You,"" as the game refers to the player character, wake up in your apartment and seek a way out into the surrounding city streets. The problem is the apartment building You are in is in shambles, leaving doors locked, hallways in ruins, and more than a few monsters running around.Right from the get go, this feels like an early Silent Hill game. Despite the very simple pixel based graphics and the side scrolling perspective, the game manages to hav a good atmosphere of tension and dread. It uses its limited perspective to its advantage, leading to a lot of atmospheric touches.It's a good thing that it has atmosphere, too, because the story is a bit all over the place. You run across a few different characters throughout your journey, and they usually serve as some sort of source of goods and supplies, while also asking You cryptic questions that don't make a whole lot of sense. Unfortunately, this is one of those games that, I have a feeling, needs to be played through numerous times in order to fully grasp what's going on, because the ending I got was anticlimactic at best and confusing at worst. I'm not someone who needs everything spelled out for me, but the vague nature of the game is a tad frustrating.Still, this is a worthwhile survival horror game. As mentioned above, it's very creepy and manages to feel old school thanks to its hunger and ammo systems. You must constantly explore to find more supplies and ammo, meaning conservation and planning are a must. Give this game a shot if you like games such as Silent Hill or are itching for something highly atmospheric."

Much like James Sutherland, Lone Survivor's protagonist searches an apartment complex that's overrun with zombies while a noise layer obscures vision. Also, much like Silent Hill 2, the threat may possibly be more psychological in origin than real.The game has multiple endings, and if you play it like you would an action game - shooting everything in sight while not caring much about the actual ""survival"" elements, you'll likely end up with one of the ""bad"" endings. This left a sour impression on my first play because of the character's constant nagging for food and sleep, and the ending I got seemed nonsensical.But if you play the game more how it's meant to be played, the hero bothers you less, and you could put yourself on a path to one of the better endings, which reveals more what the story is really about. You'll probably also pay more attention to the clues here and there and get a better sense of everything on a replay. So, those extra endings are really worth going for, though it probably won't hurt to look at a FAQ to be sure you'll get them. I ended up coming to appreciate the game much more as a result, and it certainly doesn't hurt that the soundtrack is excellent, too.And one of the things you can do is adopt a kitty!

Considering how many recent survival horror titles try to involve different, more ""realistic"" mechanics and graphics to immerse the player, ""Lone Survivor"" takes a step back, to an older, seamingly more simple style, 2D pixel graphics and a set of few, but crucial mechanics.It may seem too simple at first: No big story, it's the end of the world and you have to survive, only a few objectives to look after, get food, consider how to defend yourself, don't waste to much bullets, run, hide if you must, scavange food, don't forget to rest and maybe try to find out, what is going on in the first place. But, if you try to commit to the game and it's setting, the simplicity itself may be the key, to what really makes this game so exciting: Your mind! You start to wonder, ""what is actually going on here?"", start to think about the few decisions you have to make ""shoot, run, hide? should i eat the last scraps i got now, or should i wait a little longer?"" and you realise how the atmosphere of the game is changing, shifting according to the state the character is in, if you don't eat or sleep, the screen starts to become blurry, it may show things which might or might not be there and all the rest is up to what your fantasy is constructing around the frame the game is providing you with.And then, after a few hours, the game is over. If you just didn't like the style, maybe you'll shrug it off as not very interesting. But if you liked it, this short game will still stick to you for a while longer, as it should be the case with good games. Maybe you'll want to play it again in a few years, the graphics are ""old"" already anways, or show it to someone else, because it doesn't take much to get through anyways.However, i think it's a small, but very exciting gem of a game and definetly worth the time and money invested."

Putting those influences through a retro filter creates a pretty unique and interesting horror experience.Let's talk about the graphics.  The retro style can certainly work for a game like this, and I think it's a decent style.  It's heavy pixellated, even more so than most retro inspired games.  It's a bit of a peculiar look, but the abstraction works pretty well to create atmosphere.  The music is uncommonly good for an indie game... I would go as far as to say that this is the best soundtrack in any indie horror game, excepting maybe Corpse Party.  This is important, because a good soundtrack is vital to creating atmosphere, and Lone Survivor is much better at creating atmosphere than just about any other indie horror game.The gameplay is very good for this style of game.  It has combat and stealth elements, both of which is very simple, while at the same time always presenting the player with choices.  A lot of the game is just exploration, monsters aren't all that common.  There's also some fun survival mechanics, as you have to collect food and manage your hunger and sleep levels.  There's a huge amount of food, all of which has different effects, and you can also cook meals if you can find cooking implements.  There's also drugs you can take, with various effects.  I like that these various systems add depth to this game without feeling out of place, or distracting from the atmosphere.The story is very much in the mold of David Lynch / Silent Hill.  It works pretty well, and there's some pretty good set pieces and imagery.  You're never quite sure exactly what is going on, but you know enough to stay involved.Negatives: While the graphical style is decent and works for the game, I think it could have been done better.  Sometimes the game's art can border on amateurish.  This is obscured by the heavily pixelated graphics, but I still noticed.  While I like the gameplay in general, one thing I felt that was a little lacking was the monster variety.  There could have easily been a greater variety of monsters, and it would have added more depth to exploration as well as keeping more surprises for the player.About my rating system: I have two things I rate on.  The first is the overall score, and the second is soundtrack.  The reason why is because I feel like soundtrack is tremendously undervalued; to me, it's a tremendously important factor in whether I like a game.  For the score, I grade on a scale of 1-10, and I try to grade in such a way that each number has a meaning and each has equal importance.  The numbers have the following meanings:0: Garbage, 1: Awful, 2: Poor, 3: Underwhelming, 4: Mediocre, 5: Decent, 6: Good, 7: Great, 8: Excellent, 9: Phenomenal, 10: MasterpieceLone Survivor's score:Game Rating: 8 (Excellent)Soundtrack Rating: 8 (Excellent)"

Como bien dice la descripción, el juego trata con el genero ""psychological survivor horror"". La verdad es que te compadeces del protagonista, realmente si te pones en sus zapatos tienes una perspectiva increible del juego. El protagonista está solo en la ciudad sin saber mucho los motivos, entonces el tiene que buscar pistas e información que lo lleven a encontrar las respuestas a sus cuestionamientos; sin embargo, lo que se encontrará durante su recorrido pondrá a prueba su estado animico así como su toma de decisiones. Es un juego que bien vale la pena los 150 pesos que pagué. Muy recomendable!"

With that said, there shouldn't be any hesitation about entering the dark corridors.And yet, it's still one of the most terrifying things I've ever played.You'll always know where the hazards are. You'll always know how badly things will go if you make a mistake. You'll always have more than enough time to let the dread settle in as you step out into the next area only to find that things have gone much darker, and the infected are practically everywhere.This isn't a game that is meant to make you rush things. You'll revisit areas over a course of several in-game days, having to ration your food and knowing when to sleep, and figuring out how to slow your descent into madness.If you're rushing things, it probably means that you're panicking. But you might be doing a lot of that.If you're not into horror because you're sick of the same formula being followed every time, then consider giving Lone Survivor a try."

,Recommended,209830,13750036,"Posted: 31 December, 2014",all,Dravvad,"It's odd, this game. It is relatively minimalistic in many ways, but it turned out to be a lot better of a game than I expected. I do not mean to say that I thought the game would be bad; but I just had no idea what it would really be like, even after watching videos and seeing some photos.Lone Survivor starts off and you have no real direction. You are stuck in this weird, apocalyptic area, beginning in your apartment building. You find maps around the game with some places or rooms marked, which is helpful, but getting to the places and finding other necessary rooms or items is just random on your first playthrough. The world isn't that large, in the long run, but it is not easy to simply explore everything.The game really is a survival game. You have to make sure that your character eats healthy food, to both restore health as well as simply feed yourself and prevent death. You have to make sure you sleep regularly, which is bad if your character is starving, and getting back to your room is very difficult in some scenarios. You are very limited in what you can acquire, in terms of ammo and food, and it is relatively difficult to get around enemies your first run-through, as most do not have hiding spots near them.To be honest, this game actually scared me, and I did not expect that. The sound effects are really good, despite how simple they are, like the monster scream. I also enjoyed the pieces of music here and there throughout the game, especially the beginning/ending song. As far as graphics, again, simple, but effective. My only complaint in the aspect ratio and not really having a different resolution. At the beginning, text was taking up nearly 1/3 of my screen and I had to move back to read it. After adjusting, the whole game screen only took up like 1/4 of its available space. I understand not wanting to have some crazily detailed game (in some senses), but there could have been a better way of doing that. Either way, the graphics were mostly fine, though too fuzzy in many places.The monsters creeped me out and I often ran away as expected, and I died quite a few times. In most horror games, after I lose a few times, the monsters wear off on me. Not here. I was still creeped out by the end, mostly because the game doesn't let you get any real ""safety."" You have to make it through chunks of the world before getting back to your apartment, and there's no other way than to push on through. That gives the game a good atmosphere, as does the exploration and lack of direction. Lack of direction is not always a good thing, but it is fine in this game, as the world is not ""too big"" to explore.Story-wise, there really isn't much on your first playthrough, very likely. I made many guesses about what was going on, but by the end, I still don't know, though I have more information. I got the ""bad"" ending of the game. There are multiple endings, and it seems intentional that you need to play the game multiple times to get other endings. Many actions in the game influence your ending, and some things (like avoiding killing enemies) are really hard to do on the first playthrough because of your limitations.Despite not getting a fulfilling ending (although that's not really that rare anymore), I was still happy by the game's end. If I get into the mood again, I will try another playthrough and work harder for a better ending. One of the reasons I don't really want to do so now is because the game will play the same. I will have more items and know where to go, but nothing will really change other than some of my actions and getting a slightly different ending.I already did all of the side quests, such as visiting The Director all the time, helping Hank, and adopting the cat (which was actually a lot more enjoyable and fun than I expected). I loved the cat. Oh, and I loved the fact that Lone Survivor has a mentality system. Little cheesy actions help your character keep collected, such as talking to a plush toy, playing a handheld game system, adopting the cat, reading comics, etc. They're small things, but in such a simple game, everything comes together in a nice form.But at the same time, that is pretty much why I don't want to play again right away. I looked into the actions that influence your ending, and I pretty much did the majority of ""good"" actions to influence towards the positive ending. The only thing that mainly influenced my ending then, was that I had to kill a lot of the enemies because they were unavoidable and you do not get items like flares until late in the game. So basically, I would have to replay the game, changing nothing but using extra flares instead of firing my gun. If I hadn't done the side quests and other things, then I would replay immediately.All in all, everything was put together very well, besides the graphical sizing. I think that this game surprised me a lot, and will probably surprise others who don't know what to expect of it. I suggest playing the game, to delve into its little (rather creepy) world. Fight through, but enjoy, the atmosphere. Try to put the story together. I will return to it again, once I feel like it, and if you play it, you should return later as well."

A very long play for me, and my go to for any kind of good horror game I have, disincluding Silent Hill.GameplaySpeaking of Silent Hill, while the storyline of Lone Survivor is not as detailed, the storyline of Lone Survivor relies on a similar gameplay mechanic of Silent Hill, rather than relying on jumpscares. For the majority of the game, it's only going to be you and your gun. The gameplay itself when it comes to shooting is simple and easy to use. However some parts of the gameplay is definitely lacking. You'll find yourself using lures that barely work at times, and as the game progresses, you find yourself stuck with that one weapon. The pacing is slow, and good for a person who likes slow paced and Silent-Esque games.When it comes to the Protaganist, a gameplay mechanic known as mental health that uses several enviormental things that serve slim to nil importance to the game itself. It is not explained in full and is weirdly shoved without much explanation to determine the ending. There are barely any useful and credible ways to find out your mental health.StorylineThe storyline however, is somewhat awkward and fails to fully establish itself. The storyline jumps all over the place and gets hard to understand from a person who picks up the game. There's no distinction on what is and isn't real, or what is good and bad to the survivor. There are few things clear at what happens, and who is and isn't real. There's not as much to say about the storyline, as it is lacking at best, however there are certain parts that exceeded lacking.SoundtrackThe soundtrack is extremely good. Made also by Jasper Bryne, the soundtrack is absolutely stunning, and really helps immerse the player at points. However, despite the soundtrack being amazing, there are parts where the soundtrack fails to really immerse, and sometimes seems out of place at some points. The sound effects are very well made and placed perfectly. There's not a lot to complain about the soundtrack or sound effects, only that songs from the soundtrack sometimes feels out of place.Other Points and Final RecommendationsThe graphics, despite looking pixelated, exceeded my expectations, and really killed it in that department. It really shines in this department, and sometimes doesn't even feel as if it's pixelated, and more of a more detailed game.Overall, if you're looking for a game that has pixel-graphics, a Silent-Hill esque game, or a game with a good soundtrack and some good gameplay, I'd recommend this. However if you're looking for a linear story that isn't vague or doesn't really jump around, I'd recommend passing up on this."

A chilling and down right creepy horror game with an interesting story to the likes of the actual Silent Hill games...I got an ""Eh"" title that tries to do that with muddy graphics and some form of a narrative, but fails to captivate me enough to actually care.Lone Survivor is the 2D, pixelated SIlent Hill, that just isn't. Sure, the monsters creep you out at first, mostly due to the noise they produce then the stickman figure they happen to look like. But they just tend to be more of an annoying blockade in the hallway than something you should fear.This game also brings up some annoying mechanics like an invisible sleeping and eating meter. Cause God knows we need that much ""realism"" to a game so that people get so ""immersed"" in it! It's not at all an annoying and unnecesary mechanic, especially when the character ♥♥♥♥♥es and moans about it every 5 minutes.This game also brings back the clunky aiming mechanics of the old Resident Evil. It kinda works for it since it's used in a 2D setting. Though you'll mostly want to avoid confrontation since the enemies  tend to be really bullet absorbent. Which is a plus considering it's a survival horror game.As for the story...I'll be honest, I lost interest in this game after getting to the basement. And I really just did not care what was going on in the appartment. Who that lady in the cage was. If the monsters were actually people and the protagonist was just delusional this whole time. I just didn't give a damn.Why didn't I give a damn. The narrative felt a bit lifeless. I didn't feel like I should actually care what was going on in this world. The fact that most of dialouge amounts to the damn hunger/sleeping meter prompts whenever the protag feels hungry and/or tired may have added to that.Pros:-It's, kind of an interesting take on a Horror game. (Though I wasn't impressed.)-Some of the puzzles were actually kinda clever, like luring a monster to another room by placing meat near it.-You can kinda mix and match items to make new ones, sorta. (From what I experienced, it was mostly to cook food.)Cons:-Hunger and Sleep meter...oh joy.-Muddy pixel graphics (The filter made it seem nice, but it really just adds to it.)-I didn't care for the story or mystery of the game.(Which is a big con considering that's an important motivator to play these types of games.)In short:If you're interested in a 2D, sidescrolling horror game. Try something else.You don't wanna take my word on it and wanna jump into the game anyway? It's your money. Do with it what wish.I recommend you to get it on sale."

This leads to the complete inability to be scared.However, there are other issues abound:- opening the inventory screen does not pause the game,- the mental health system the game gives almost no clues about and which is the main factor for the ending the player receives,- navigating the basement of the apartment building is a complete chore,- the chase sequence in this basement is a case of the main character going full retard and conveniently forgetting about the shortcuts (or, to be more precise, not allowing the player to use them) just for the sake of the chase,- the constant need to eat and sleep every 10 minutes just to pad out the length of the game,and last but not least,- the fact that the whole game is a tribute to Silent Hill without a sliver of its own identity; it even follows the same story cliches.The whole time through I was thinking how much I would prefer to play an actual Silent Hill game over this.At least the music's nice."

The game is more ""survival"" than ""horror"" as I wound up trying to keep myself alive rather than soaking in the atmosphere and as a result, made me just stop playing the game.Atmosphere: 4/10While the atmosphere does give off an eerie feeling at times and give off the feeling that everything is dead, I wasn't really scared or even creeped and I didn't feel very threatened.  You can tell when standard monsters are around only because they create what sounds like radio static, you can easily outrun them, and they won't follow you to another screen.Story: 2/10The story was not very interesting and sometimes hard to follow.  The basic plot is that you are believed to be the last man alive but leaves his appartment to try and find if there are any other survivors.  It's a good setup, but the pacing is so slow that it doesn't seem in any rush to progress past the ""escape the apartment"" portion which takes a long time to actually do and has the character go through multiple halucinations and black-outs instead of moving forward.  Taking bule or green pills before sleeping will put you in a dream state where two different characters bring up psychological topics to ask you.  As much as I like this idea though, it distracts from the main story and just took me out of the game.Graphics: 6/10I have to be honest and i don't mean to offend anyone, but the characters in this game look pretty ugly.  I am not expecting them to look like something out of a AAA title so I do cut it some slack, but they still look unappealing.  The monsters look basic and the ""walkers"" as I will call them do not look very threatening.  The graphics' saving grace is the backgrounds as they do look dead and abandoned giving the game a sense of dread.Gameplay: 3/10Surviving is a challenge itself as you WILL be dying more times than you can count.  When encountering monsters, you are mostly given items such as rotten meat or flares that will only distract enemies and the only thing you have to kill them with and defend yourself is a shoddy pistol with VERY scarce ammo.  More often than not, you will wind up running out of ammo as monsters take quite a few hits to kill and the later monsters take even more hits to kill, so you will be constantly backtracking looking for blue pills or ammo you hope you had missed; and you'll be lucky if you can find them.  This could have easily been fixed if a better gun was available or at the very least a melee weapon, but the protagonist says he would rather keep his weak pistol.  If you want the player to stick with one gun, don't throw in something that will make us want something different.There is a hunger mechanic that seems to just be there and didn't really affect my survival.  The game just seemed to nag me when I got hungry or got sleepy to make me eat some food I had found or go back to my room and sleep to the point where it felt more like a chore.Replay Value: 2/10I honestly, can't see myself replaying this game anytime soon.  There is not a lot of things I understood even looking back at them and it will just be the same repetitive gameplay that gets boring after a while.Final Verdict: This game has potential and so do the developers.

(go see it, it's worth a look)i think it's not definitely worth the price; the developers should have put really much effort and improvements to justify it.so basically, in front of the price, i'm forced to underlight the CONS of this game. a buyer must know what he's buying:*an horror game that is not really scaring. no old jumpscares, nothing unexpected, nothing made me feel any fear.*a game with repetitive atmosphere, that gives no real contribute to the horror component; the music too is not worth a particular mention, for what i remember.*a game with hunger and sleepness to deal with, but in a way that becomes frustrating: your character needs to sleep or eat every 3 seconds, and believe me, this becomes boring after 15 minutes of play.*a game whit a confusing story, really hard to understand, or maybe with no sense at all.*a game with at maximun 10 chars to encounter and to talk/interact with.*a game with a quite confusing map.*a game with multiple endings, one less rewarding than the others. you won't have the will to finish the game more than 1 time to see them, i believe.that's my opinion, i really don't understand all the positive comments i red about this game....graphic 10/10?music 10/10?atmosphere 10/10?....story 10/10 ...??men, were you drunk  when you wrote them?"

I was not scared for a moment. Survival? Perhaps an excuse to give you limited items to get past monsters so that you get stuck if you do not manage to use them right. Adventure? More like a walk in your apartment building and city with a lot of meat and weird gurgling. 2D and Indie? .... I guess I'll give it that.Pros;-Intruiging start and 'hub' to come back to.-Nice and simple graphics that play around with the pixels on occasionCons;-Story is 'interpretable'. I dislike this, but for others it might be fun to theorise what is going on and what the significance is of random bathroom tiles or meat growths in specific rooms.-Controls are cumbersome-Items appear necessary to progress, but are limited. There is no easy way to revisit a previous part to check if you missed out on a puzzle item or something of the like.I bought this game out of my love for horror games, pixel graphics, and puzzles, but I was let down. The puzzles have, in classic point-and-click fashion, insane solutions. Solving a problem does not so much depend on figuring out a solution as it depends on scouring all the pixels and places for the items you need.The story is what seems to be the most important part of this game, but it is thoroughly incoherent. Told purely from our main character and whatever he sees, there is never a sense that there is a world outside of him. Perhaps intentional, perhaps not. Who knows? Certainly not me, because this story is interpretational and has different endings based on some things you need to do/not do. ( Kill all the monsters, don't kill all the monsters, make a choice in a hospital or something...)All the horror classics are here, with none of the refinement or horror. Spooky girl who may or may not be part of your past. Clear signals that not-all-is-right and that your main character might be in a coma/delusion/dream/death. Monsters whose existence are never explained...Perhaps if the sound design had been better, and the gameplay smoother and more refined, I could have loved this game. As it was, it failed to be scary. It also failed to be fun to play, or intruiging. I do not understand the positive reviews at all - for a horror indie-title with more atmosphere, better monsters, and similarly awkward controls, just download Cry of Fear."

I believe there's been some kind of nuclear fallout, and the only few people alive are your character and some shady dealer who lives in the basement.Regardless, it's challenging because you have to figure out where you need to go, what to do, and what to get all based on context. It's a good throw back in the way where it would be nostalgic, but enough of current technology to have the wonky controls of games back then."

The atmosphere was dark and foreboding, pretty much making me summon courage every time I had to take a step foward. The monsters, while nothing to look at, did creep me out and want to stay away, but they got kind of boring after a while. Things did eventually get repetitious, but what kept me going was the music, the atmosphere and helping the main character survive. It is short, however, and I wished it could have gone on just a bit longer, but I enjoyed my playthrough. The ending I got kind of sucked, but that's what I get for killing everything.

As you can see, I didn't get too far. I really liked the lighting in Lone Survivor, but that was about it. I wanted to like the game, but it was difficult to navigate a 2D game with a 3D map (maybe that's just me). I know the creator wanted to pay homage to Silent Hill, but he really didn't need to use the same map to do it. There are good 2D maps out there. Take Mercenary Kings, for example. You can see where you are on the map and it's easy to direct yourself based on lines connecting rooms.I will give the game props for its creepy atmosphere and art, but the main character looked like he had a♥♥♥♥♥♥eating grin and it was really distracting when I was exploring the environment.

,Recommended,209830,18722568,"Posted: 27 October, 2015",all,Bobblehead,"Jasper Byrne has created a pixellated game so immersive that 8-bit monsters become absolutely terrifying. The several mysterious personalities of Lone Survivor represent the different pieces of your character's psyche, and as the journey goes on you begin to make decisions with a certain sense of mortal and personal albatross. At no point does the game feel like a toy to be played with or a skill to be mastered. There is only survival by any means, and as a player you feel every hit taken, every shot fired, every gruesome corpse as a grave reminder of your own mortality.This is a truly rare game. It has chilling aesthetics, tense gameplay, and an immersive plot with several endings. Lone Survivor is not a scary game with cheesy jump-scares. It's a true horror survival game with an immersive environment. You won't be able to play this game in one sitting or even a couple days; the human body isn't meant to handle the stress this game imparts for more than a few hours at a time."

,Recommended,209830,3340464,"Posted: 2 May, 2013",all,SneakAttack!,"A survival horror game which is ACTUALLY SCARY!? We haven't had one of those in a while. The game is one of the few survival horror games where surviving is actually difficult, as food and ammo is scarce, and your character is pretty useless at aiming at anything more than 2 meters away. Even your flashlight runs on batteries which you need to scavange for. You will spend a lot of the time making sure that your character is well rested and fed properly, as well as scavenging for ammo and later in the game flairs. The sheer tension created by the game is becoming rare in horror games in general nowadays, and it's nice to see a ruturn to psychological horror, instead of just jump scares and easily killable enemies. The main way this game does this isn't actually the surrealism of the story or the environment, or even the demonic, faceless monsters that you'll be facing, but the sound. Static starts playing whenever you're seen by an enemy, prompting you to run away or shoot it, and the little ambient sounds of the environment serve to make sure that you are fearing your next step. There are a lot of clever little things done with the music and sound which make the game a far better experience. The open eneded story is very enjoyable to play through, and many little things that you do in the game change the way it plays out. The only part I felt was out of place was a chase sequence in the middle which was mostly just memorizing paths, and the end boss, which was fairly dull and unimaginative, but other than that the enemies were terrifying and the story interesting and surreal. It's quite short, but you probably won't be able to do everything in your first playthrough, and maybe not even your second, so you won't be compeltly done with it for a while. All in all, it's an amazing game, and I would definitely reccomend it to anyone who likes survival horror games, or just games in general. I'm pretty sure it's also the first survival horror game in which you can adopt a cat. Get it."

The pixel graphics really improve upon the game since it allows the developer to create creepy and shocking monsters without crossing the boarder of horrific and the look also adds to the narrative because it adds the sense that everything isn't real for the protaginst which only makes the plot more gripping. This games has multiple endings and all the endings are achieve through your choices in the game which makes playing the game intense and makes it feel as though your choices truly do matter which some games fail to do. I would recommend Lone Survivor to most people however keep in mind that some may find this game more difficult than others and this isn't the type of game that you can play casually.

Draws strong influence from Silent Hill series (no secret that the game's creator, Jasper Byrne, is a fan).  It feels like a 16-bit version of Silent Hill with a dash of Eternal Darkness thrown in.  You are a survivor of an outbreak that has devastated your city.  You awake in your apartment alone, supplies nearly exhausted and find yourself forced to confront the horrors outside to both gather life-sustaining supplies and perhaps find a way to escape the decaying city.  Along the way you will encounter mysterious figures and come to question which, if any, of these encounters even happened.  Unlike many run n' gun action survival horror games. Combat is not something encouraged and you must also take care of your basic biological needs such as eating and sleeping lest your mental health deteriorate and cause you to descend into madness.
