,Not Recommended,209870,29980555,Posted: 17 February,all,Dexter,"This game was absolutely incredible when I first started playing it in July of 2013. At first it seemed like just another Call of Duty ripoff that decided to take the free-to-play route, but as I invested more time into the game, I began realizing how distinct this game is from others. Just pressing the V key is enough to see that.In all honesty I don't know where to begin. The weapon balancing was pretty good, but that kinda changed later. The customization options were, and still are, broad and lets you really personalize your character. The community was fantastic for the most part, and as time went on, the playerbase decreased, which led to each lobby being like those old towns you hear about where everyone knows each other.There was a time for about a year and a half where the developers did not update the game due to internal problems, and the game's functionality certainly reflected that. The servers didn't work too well, constantly crashed, were rather laggy, ect. A lot of the playerbase died out at this point since the game was having these problems, but it just made the loyal parts of the community closer.Then they updated it after all that time with the Parity patch. They took all of the new content from the PS4 version and brought it to PC, which everyone was excited for at first. What ended up happening was we got a game that felt really strange and unlike what we were used to. Recoil was reduced greatly, which limited the viable builds to be damage-focused builds for the weapons. The question for moving further into the game changed from ""how can I build this gun to fit my playstyle and comfort?"" to ""how can I build this gun to do more damage?"". To me, this lack of diversity ruins the fun for me, especially considering the amount of diversity before the Parity patch.If I were to have written this three years ago, I would have said that this was the best multiplayer FPS game available and that if you are willing to grind a bit to find equipment that matches your playstyle, you will enjoy this game greatly. But sadly I can't say that anymore. I would not recommend this game to anyone looking for a fresh FPS experience."

,Not Recommended,209870,29699757,Posted: 4 February,all,Brownninja97,"One of the most painful downvotes for me, some of my best gaming memories were with blacklight in 2013-2015 i was honestly addicted and managed to even pull my friends into playing it, blacklight was seriously one of the best balanced and well playing f2p fps games out there and it was a game that people kept coming to, that is not an easy feat in the f2p fps market sadly the devs just randomly left it to die, they also released patches which activatly made just about everything worse and they never did fix that, there is so much money left that could have been made, this was a great game in its haydays, it still looks fantastic as well which is such a shame. This was one of the games that made me move to pc gaming exclusively and now its dead all because the developers randomly abandoned it when it was going strong when there was an active scene surrounding it, it is a shame because it could have been so much more however good things must come to an end and this has met its end just slowly being starved of servers and players until it is no more.I met a lot of friends because of this, found a new platform and so many options, it will be sad when the servers ultimately shut down but this is an example of how you can screw up even when you were doing everything correctly, this is what happens when you forget who your true audience is.hardsuit labs made a fantastic game and perfect world destroyed it."

Grinding on money is quite hard but thats not the main point here. The servers are dead, not many players online. To be honest I have waited for this game since it was released. I only got on it at the end of 2016 as my internet before was horrible. But after a few weeks of playing i realise that the servers are getting really empty. For some reason also my ping is very high even though my internet is working just fine. Basically in summary, The servers are not well maintained. If that is fix i do not mind jumping back into the game."

As far as gameplay goes its par to none but the recent changes have made it unenjoyable to new players who iether do not want to or cannot afford to pay into it. starting off with a fresh account you will find that each half-hour match, even a good one, you only make about 150 GP. well, any gun costs about 25k GP to perm it and add it to a loadout. For players who have the cash to buy ""zen"" (the ingame pay for currency) they can buy a ""GP duplicator"" and have half the grind you will have. It use to be that zen was used for purely cosmetic changes but now the gameplay is dependant on it if u dont want too loose ur mind playing the default weapon loadouts for days on end."

While it does have a shadow of a pay-to-win ethos, the guns are all reliable enough to do sufficient damage that teamplay will overwhelm one Rambo with the best gun.  That's what I enjoy about this: people are happy to work as a team!The down side, I must say, is I cannot now find anyone else online :( it is as if the game has died.  However, with 11,000+ positive reviews, I'm LFG for some great rounds!Even if the devs have gone to Xbox support, this has plenty of replayability with the right teammates.  Try it out.   Get some friends in on it too as it's a proper LAN party game!"

This game is like a fps mmo its online and has many modes to pick. the way you get iterms is sick and you get moeny to buy guns and other stuff through killing other people in game. overall the graphhics are insane and i did not belive you only need a 1gb GPU so i was mo0re than up to the job it looks like the latest COD but not quite battlefield one. over all this should be a AAA title avlibel over all systems and you can this on allmost any laptop and pc with a 512mb GPU so yes AMD Radeon R5 users there is a game you can play!!!

You are set against other players that have a better advantage with one hit weapons and better gear. the currency system is meh. And the dreded ""oh here is some gear that costs 100 in game currency or 250 currence that you can get with real money. SIKE! its actually 1608900 to keep, its only 100 for a day."" its dumb. I know you are supposed to get money some how but even so...From the small time i have been playing it would appear that the playerbase is dead. literaly only 3 servers with people playing on with a combined player count of 34 people on. I was hopping from one server to the next with myself being the only one on it. it was only when i filtered the servers i actuallt found people.the tutorial is ok I guess, it tells you what you need to know.Testing yourself against bots it pointles as they are about as dificult as taking a♥♥♥♥♥♥ The controlls seem a bit sluggish for me. I dont know what is it, the movement seems great but when ever I click to aim or use me detective vision (its not called that but still, you can probably see where i'm coming from) it takes a moment for my character to actually register what is going on.Overall.... do what you want, you might like this game, you might not, if you are looking for an online fps where you have to pay to get good stuff with a wider range of movement and 'character customisation' just get the new call of duty game, they are about that same and youd probably spend the same amount on them.

The graphics in the pictures looked nice, and I thought I finally found a futuristic tactital shooter. Turns out I was wrong.- The gameplay is COD: IW, basiclly, running around with no coordination, and no cool double-jumps and wall-runs and sliding. (The parkour was the only thing I liked about COD: AW) Remember the system in most FPS nowadays where you opened up chest and got rare and cool loot? Sometimes? Well, this game has something else: Real money. This game is the definition of a Pay 2 Play. You won't last out there without at least 1.00$ spent on this game. If you manage to stay with this game for a day, you'd play all day, rack up what it looks like to be enough cash to buy a gun or something, and then it's like x10 the amount, just to rent it for 1 FREAKING day.- Now to customization, or the HORRID customization! Want to look cool?! Spend 10.00$ on this game to look like a person with only two skins. It makes you look cool, but when you start out, you want to customize your character and feel different. The first time you join a game, you realize everyone else is wearing the excact same thing.Stay away from this game. Looks cool, but it's a waste of Disk space. Just my opinion (and Facts)Pay 20.00$ To get this new cool DLC! Jeez, at least COD: IW gave you something cool you'll actually play with."

So, what may have been a good game at one time, is no longer. I can't recommend the game. i just can't i mean,its free so you can give it a shot. but don't expect much."

I played back in 2012-2014, when the competitive scene was booming and the game itself was great. I remember picking up back the game and fixing my K.D. because when i was a kid it was .6 but I raised it all the way back to 1.6, and I remember becoming so good at the game I would go 50-0 in some matches and even started to become recognized by some competitive players during the time. This game has fallen and is no longer a game worth playing anymore. The developers have completely abandoned this game, and the only reason I would ever return is if the game is finally given to a company more willing to devote some type into making this game what it should have been. The current and pass developers show that they don't care what so ever for the players of their game, and if there is one thing that is important in making a product its ensuring that the consumer enjoys the content. This game may be free to play but there are many more great free to play games that are much more enjoyable than this game. It really did have potential and the only thing I am hoping for is that a company can dust this game off and make it what I always hoped to be. The game itself had great game mechanics in it that other first person shooters didn't have at the time, although some do now, the game itself still to me has some potential to return to glory, but not with its current developers. For now I wouldn't recommend this game for the time being."

Obviously I've sunk way too many hours of my life into this game and unfortunately I'm done with it.I enjoyed the game far more before the parity patch when the second company bought it and took over.My biggest gripe with the game is that most of the weapons feel way too samey.  While I understand there are inherant differences between an Sub Machine Gun, a Heavy Assault Rifle, and a Full Auto Bullpup, they are so miniscule today versus what they used to be that it may as well not matter.I build for accuracy and low recoil on my weapons, and I don't tend to play at the breakneck speeds that some folks like to.  When a Heavy Assault Rifle, on full auto, can kill me across a map in one or two shots, it pisses me off based on the fact that my Burst Rifle (3 round burst marksman style rifle) or even a Bolt Action Rifle loses, when at those ranges I shouldn't even be hit on a regular basis.I used to like the game, I've put money into it, but I'm done with it.  It is free, so I'd recommend giving it a shot, but I can't recommend it as any sort of a fun game anymore."

Sure the unlocks can be somewhat of a grind, but the starting weapons are satisfying enough to keep you coming back (I personally loved the bolt action rifle). And if things are going too slow in game purchases really aren't that expensive for what you get. Would 100% recommend as I have play played a shooter this satisfying in a while."

I recently revisited the game and was grossly disappointed.This game is still good, don't get me wrong, but it is infested with anti-player microtransactions, paywalls and bugs.Many people cannot play the game due to unknown bugs that the developers refuse to fix.If you enjoy the game, I will not take that away from you, but if you're considering downloading it. Don't. There are better games out there and this game is not worth your time anymore. I am a level 100 player with almost every item in the game and yet this game brings me no joy to play it anymore. This game I used to love is no longer on my computer. I detest it.Hear the word of someone who has watched the rise and fall of this game first hand:Do not play this game."
