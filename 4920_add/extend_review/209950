But sadly I could never get my last 3 achievements. Been a while since I played this game, and well it was the only game I had at the time to play for well over a month until I found another game that got my interest, then I got more and now I just drown in them.I really am reminded to get back and play this game some more, should I or should'nt I is the question, as I DO REMEMBER enjoying this game ever so much. While I can't discribe the game as such, I am more a visual person anyway so my explanations are not so great, but the store page does do a great job visually, so as I always say what you see, hear and read is what you get.Price wise well at 80% off why complain I got this game for 50% off with a coupon when those trading cards first got introduced and so I was a gluten for punishment and or MORE FUN. ;)Look this is a fun little game, never the  less give it a go, what do you have to loose a dime in a dozen. ;DForgot it has Trading cards and I already mentioned Achievements somewhere, or am I missing something ?I Understand if my review is lousy ok, but thank you for taking the time to look and read anyway. You all have a right to your opinions, thats why we need a thumb in the middle, to show people have looked and  given it some time and thought. We need the traffic light thumbs. Anyway thank you. This game to me was worth the time i spent on it, maybe I will go back 1 day, and try for the last 3 acheviements that I have missed :)"

,Recommended,209950,23728371,"Posted: 23 June, 2016",all,Audish,"What is with our predisposition for match 3? What purpose does it serve our primordial lizard brains to delight us when we put three of something together and watch it disappear? Whatever the reason may be, the game industry has seized upon this weakness with terrible force, compelling us to crush candies and swap orbs and do all sorts of ridiculous things to rack up points. Triple Town would be no different, save for one additional level of complexity that adds a unique hint of progression to the formula.Rounds in Triple Town take place on small islands, gridded off for you to set your plants and buildings on. You're given something to place, anything from a tuft of grass to a sturdy oak to an entire house, which you can put on any open square. If three of the same thing end up adjacent to each other, such as three bushes, they combine on the spot of the last one placed into the next level of thing, such as a tree. In this way you can work your way up from grass to bush to tree to house to mansion to castle and on. Most of the time you'll be placing grass but you occasionally get higher-level objects straightaway, which you can use to your advantage or store in your single storage spot for later.There are other factors at play, such as bears you must place that move about and block your construction, or crystals that act as wildcards, combining with any two other things to complete the set. Your goal is to amass points and reach certain milestones like Settlement and City, and the simple challenge of trying to finagle everything into place is honestly enough to keep you going. You'll slowly start puzzling out how to plan your grasses ahead to get the bushes in the right places to get trees where you want, and then realize you need to plan even further for the houses that the trees become. There's a remarkable amount of planning and strategizing involved, as well as the challenges of unexpected bear or crystal appearances.All this would make for a fine coffee-break puzzle game, at least for awhile, but there's thankfully more to it than that. As you play, you obtain special items like farms and ores that cannot be used in normal maps. In between rounds, you travel to your capital city where you can place these to grant you additional resources periodically. These resources come in the form of items that can be used during rounds to place certain clutch objects when you need them most. The capital follows the same match-3 rules as well, meaning placing your special items intelligently can yield much greater returns. Triple Town basically gives you a hub city to develop which provides resources that makes the individual puzzles easier, allowing you to earn more items to develop your hub. It's a brilliant little gameplay loop that can keep you hooked for want of one more upgrade to your city.It's almost a perfect package, but I must admit the presentation drags it down a little. The actual feel of Triple Town is like that of a Flash game, trapped in a static windowed mode with simple vector graphics and animation. There's almost no polish to the menus or buttons, either, which makes them feel more like developer placeholders than finished products. The sound is adequate for what it is but does nothing to alleviate the otherwise cheap feel of the game. Coming off of titles like Mini Metro that manage to be simple AND stylish, Triple Town can feel a bit disappointing. Still, the core mechanics are plenty solid and the progression systems are very addictive, so if you can look past the presentation you'll have a lovely little timesink to enjoy here.Did you enjoy this review? I certainly hope so, and I certainly hope you'll check out more of them athttps://goldplatedgames.com/or on mycuration page!"

Pretty much the same thing can be said about the game's audio. The visual and audio can be adjusted in the game's option menu.Gameplay""Triple Town"" is your typical match 3 game by Spry Fox. Instead of match like tokens to clear the board. The individual is tasked to match building structure and plant foliage to build a town from scratch. Most of the matches that are made is rewarded with  two or five coins. In most cases there are treasure chests with random resources.The coins that are earned from the gameplay are used to make purchases in the main island area. The items are very expensive it will require the individual to save up enough coins to purchase that particular item. Since there is no option of selling off extra resources. Saving up coins can turn into a mundane task to complete.The main island, building structures only available to make, they give out certain amount of resources for earning certain amount of points during gameplay. And their max upgrade is tier ten.MiscellaneousThere are total of twelve different trading cards. You only get the six of those cards from the game. There are several ways to get the rest of the trading card: Purchased from Steam's Market; Trade with friends; Booster Packs and it's Booster Pack Creator.Final thoughts, the game it's enjoyable to certain extent, even though it comes with a mundane task to complete. As for the game's replay value it's low. I would recommend this game but not at the full price.http://store.steampowered.com/app/209950"

76561198064050389,Recommended,209950,20236294,"Posted: 2 January, 2016",all,Jxt09,"There's a tl;dr at the end for those who just want a quick synopsis.Games like this make me wish Steam had a number system for reviews, like 1-10, instead of just positive or negative.  Because I do like this game but it does have some limitations which make it difficult to make a positive review.  Especially since this was originally a mobile phone game with microtransactions.  No, don't stop reading!  It's not as bad as the typical phone game ported to Steam.From the screenshots you might think this is a typical match 3 casual game.  And it is, but not like Bejeweled or other games like that.  Triple Town is all about the strategy of placement.   The main playing field (there are several variations, not just one field) is a big grid with some items already placed.  Each turn you get an item like grass or bush and you have to place it somewhere on the grid.  When you place a grass next to two other grasses they instantly combine to form a bush.  Get three bushes together and they form a tree.  Three trees form a small red house.  Three red houses form a bigger house.  3 of those form a mansion.  3 mansions form a castle.  3 castles form a sky castle.  So you can see how you can quickly run out of room.  The items you get are not totally random, there must be a variable to give a greater chance for grass and bushes since you get those the most.You do get random items to help, like the blue crystal which acts like a wild card to instantly make a match of any 2 items you already have on the grid.  And you can buy items with the gold coins you get (this is where the microtransactions were in the mobile version).  Like buy a bush or tree for a few coins.  But I like to save my coins for the other part of the game: your town.When you run out of room on the game field you go back to your town.  It's actually an island.  You build items here that use the same match 3 thing as the field but for buildings.  Like, 3 fields make a big field, 3 of those make a bale of wheat (or whatever it is), 3 of those make a store house, 3 of those make something else (I've forgotten).  There's farming, gold mining, and defense (cannons, towers, etc), Though you don't get attacked, it's just for show.  This is where I choose to use the coins I earn in the matching fields.  You can buy extra squares of land to add on to your island, extra matching items like fields or fences.  Or even a crane to move an item to a different location.  And once you're rolling in the dough (have lots of coins to spare) you can even buy decorations like letters, statues, and stuff like that to personalize your town.I'm sure by now you can imagine the microtransactions and how much money could be spent (wasted!) on stuff in this game.  Which brings me to my point in the beginning, why I hesitate to write a positive review.  Normally I am against microtransactions.  But I love the cute graphics in this game and the strategy involved.  The bears are especially cute and the way the villagers go ""eek"" and run when the bears growl.tldr:Ported mobile game that had microtransactionsCute graphicsDeep strategy in placing itemsBuild your town, lots of personalization availableBut it takes forever to get enough coinsGet it on sale"

I don't really think of it as a ""match 3"" game, because even though you do match 3 things to create a better a thing that takes up less space so that you can create more bigger things, there is more strategy than luck involved, since you choose where to place each thing. It's simple to understand and get into, and I find it pretty soothing. I enjoy it, and at the same time, it's something I can sort of mindlessly play while I'm on the phone, or while I'm getting ready to go to sleep, etc. I'm not especially good at it, mind you, but I do enjoy it a lot. It's currently my go-to game when I'm not sure what I really want to do, and I wind up sticking with it longer than planned every time, but it's also fine for when I'm only going to have a very few minutes to play, because I can exit the game super quickly and it's saved automatically."

It takes a bit too long to progress but if you get into it you start to devise great little strategies to build the biggest city you can. If the meta-game was better and there were more levels I would recommend this game to everyone, but the content does fall a bit short. So be advised. All this game really has to offer is a solid core mechanic.So, if you are the type of person who likes to play Tetris constantly trying to beat your own high score (like me) then this game is for you.

To be honest I  purchased it over the Christmas period  (I think it may have been in  one of the Flash Sales)  without even  bothering to  read the   description;  relying instead  on  its looks.  I scanned the  piccies and thought it looked interesting in a cute sort of way.I don't play that many match three games nowaday's; perhaps  the odd level of Puzzle Quest for the RPG elements and  maybe one of the Atlantis  games (e.g. Call of Atlantis), Bejewelled, Zuma or 4 Elements for more basic game play.  I really didn't expect another   original take on  a casual Match 3,  with city building  elements and   strategy included,.  This  game  turned out to be a  nice little brain teaser  as well and   kept my attention  far longer than most  casual arcade games do these days.I usually play these games as fillers in between  the big boys or if I need a break  from shooting zombies or digital  OpFor but I can see myself spending hours playing this game.I highly recommend Triple Town,  especially if you like casual   games with  a pitch of originality  sprinkled in.  :)"

I was also disappointed to learn the mobile version didn't have a Capital City to build between rounds. After spending so much time working on my Capital City in the PC version, I felt like the mobile game was only half-finished without it.

,Recommended,209950,811519,"Posted: 20 December, 2012",all,mark | dj.,"Triple Town is an excellent match-3+ game with a small twist. Combine three bushes and they'll turn into a tree. Create and match three trees and it'll become a house and so on and so forth. It's all about the points and the coins. It's quite addictive, trust me.The coins can be used to upgrade your hub, a place where you can pick a gameplay mode (sort of) before playing/ Or it can be used to buy items, like extra houses or bushes. Unfortunately, items are limited so you have to choose wisely. The items are also quite expensive, so buying an item isn't always a good choice.The hub is all about creating farms, mines and other buildings. See it as some sort of mini-game. Except you can't really mess things up here. You'll be able to collect rewards from your buildings every couple of hours. Rewards that'll help you when playing the 'real' game. The developers haven't thought things through with the time limit though, because earning coins is kind of slow and tedious and waiting for several hours before being able to collect a reward could make people lose interest (more quickly than intended).But I heard it might be changed in the near future, so let's just hope for the best.Anyway, Triple Town is easily one of the my favorite casual games.[Rating: 79/100]"

76561198025378723,Recommended,209950,3627541,"Posted: 7 June, 2013",all,StarryMight,"""Triple Town"" is a unique Match 3 game where you build as big a colony town as possible by matching three or more objects. These objects can evolve into others by making appropriate matches (e.g. three Grasses make a Bush, three Bushes make a Tree...three Trees make a Hut...and there's more after that! ;-D). Matching more than three items, or mathcing certain high-end items will gift you different goodies that improve your score or other parts of the game! What you're given to place each time is random, but you can place these objects in any free space you want (with the objects melding where you place the last item in the cluster), so there's more strategy involved than the average Match 3.Besides building materials, there are helpful items, like the Crystal, which is a wild card that completes matches (often important for much easier matching of high-end items!), but placing them without a Match makes a Boulder. Match three Boulders with the Crystals, however, and you'll get a Mountain that contains a Treasure Chest that contains a random prize. To get the Chest you need the Imperial Robot, which also lets you get rid of an unwanted item (most items penalize your score when destroyed, though...keep that in mind).But watch out, there are Bears and Ninja Bears who'll try to impede your building! If you can trap a Bear or use an Imperial Robot on him, he turns into a Tombstone, and if you can trap three or more bears, the resulting Tombstones turn into a Church, and three of those make a Cathedral, and three of those make a Treasure Chest. Ninja Bears jump around and mostly can only be stopped by the Imperial Robot.There are more items such as Fortune Cookies (which tell you the next five items that you'll be given to use), and Crates (which let you temporarily stash an item on the map), but these are gotten through the Shop and the Captiol City (more on those later!).If you can't place something in a good spot right away, there's a little space set aside on each level where you can save an item, hopefully for a better use later in your game.When you do run out of space (hopefully later rather than sooner!), your score is finalized, and you win some Coins and Capitol City materials (more on those in a bit!). If you need to stop playing a level, you can pick up where you left off later. There is no limit to how many times you can play a level; if you start a new level after finishing one, a new one is rolled for you!There are six different kinds of levels: ""Standard colony"" (self-explainitory), ""City on a lake"" (actually, it's a ""Standard colony"" with a small lake in the center), ""Peaceful Valley"" (island with no Bears!), ""A dangerous forest"" (island with lots of Bears!), ""City on an island"" (small island). You can also revisit the Tutorials that you play the first time you launch the game, if you wish. You visit these from the Capitol City hub, which you build and improve mainly by making matches, too! You'll mainly get the materials from playing the game. The highest level buildings in your town will gift you materials and items everytime you earn so many points at a time in levels!There is also a shop system that lets you buy building objects and helpful items with coins that you win in-game, mainly by completing levels. There are two different shops; one for the colonies, and one for the Capitol City. The colony shop lets you buy materials and items, but they're limited in supply, and replenish after so many turns. But if you've got the money, they can help you keep building for longer! The Capitol Shop lets you buy materials, Decorations, Expansion Tiles, and a Crane that lets you pick up and move an item to a better spot. These will cost you, though, so build some colonies!There are personal High Score lists for each level, and 10 Achievements to earn. Recently, support for Steam's new Trading Card program has been added, too.Overall, this is a great and different Match 3 game! Definitely check it out! :-D"

Very clean art design, great thematic flavour all added in with ""just one more round"" gameplay.  The dual layered nature of the game with your home island (persistant and generates resources for use in the colony games and building the main island) and with the colony games (the main tile laying match puzzle strategy portion) leads to a much greater depth of play than is first apparent.Yes, in the beginning the rewards seem paltry compared to the prices at the store.  However, I found that with proper planning you will use very little of the items in the store.  On your home island you will most often use the crane to move a mistakenly places merged level 3 or 4 tile.  Get to planning ahead to avoid this!  Save the 20K gold for the 5 tile expansion.Do not be afraid to spend gold on the colony boards!!  Bushes are cheap at 150 gold and get you out of a pile of trouble.

No sense of progression whatsoever, no story, no new levels, zones and themes\settings to aim for. The mobile version had themes, by the way.

The only reward for that grinding are the extra tiles for the 'permanent city', grind for 3 woods - get a tile of fence, or go for 'aesthetics' and put yourself a giant(=tile-sized) bear statue or a 'F'-shaped bush.Don't get me wrong, I was not expecting  miracles from a match3 mobile port.

It really is one of those one more turn games - easy to pick up from where you left off and leaves you with an overwhelming desire to beat your best score.It is a match 3 game at it's core, but with a very clever aspect to it. You match 3 building blocks to create a single block that is ""one up"". For example combine 3 grass tiles to make a bush and then combine 3 bushes to make a tree and so on. There is also the added difficulty of bears spawning on your grid which, put simply you need to kill. That's right, a cutesy game where you need to block in animals, which converts them to gravestones, which, staying with the theme of the game can be combined into a church.The only downside of this game is that it is probably more suited to a mobile platform as a bit of the ""pick up and play"" aspect is lost on PC. That's not to say that you won't sink hours into it, just simply that your gaming sessions will likely be a bit longer (which is no bad thing) and you won't be sat on the toilet as you match 3.Definitely a game I'd recommend but watch out for the ninja bears."

That said, I'd say that since buying it, I've probably sunk 10-15 hours into actually playing this game. I played for a good 5-10 hours after purchasing it two and a half years ago. Got caught up in a bunch of other games, and came back to it last week, determined to get the last 2 or 3 achievements, and put in at least another 5 hours.That might seem like a lot for what deceptively looks like such a simple game, but the crux of the matter is as follows: 1) I was determined to beat it. For neurotic achievement hunter me, that meant, another perfect game. 2) It takes a lot of planning, like playing a chess game and trying to think a dozen moves ahead. I sometimes found a scratch pad and pencil helpful for planning things out. 3) The effing bears! And lastly, 4) This game is more than a little bit addictive. You tell yourself, nope, just going to finish this building and I'm done for the night. And some bear gets in the way of a building you've been working on for the past 5 minutes, and somehow, you've got a new game going because you know you can beat it this time.I don't know that it's something that I would have shelled out $10 for. But I'm stingy like that. Having paid 3.99 for it, I find I'm okay with the price to time played/enjoyment ratio. The last couple of achievments are hard, but there's a pretty great guide in the community hub for it. In the end, I probably won't play this game again, or at least not any time soon, but I don't by any means regret the purchase."

,Recommended,209950,3976646,"Posted: 19 June, 2013",all,Mivo,"Triple Town is a match-three game paired with simplistic city building elements that requires more strategic thinking than games in this genre usually do.The game is easy to learn and pretty hard to put away. The premise is simple: You start with a somewhat empty board, the ""city"", and then receive one component per turn, which you need to place on the board. Three of the same kind result in one piece of the next higher tier. For example, three bunches of grass give you a bush, and three (or more) bushes connected horizontally or vertically give you a tree.The tricky part is that the resulting item appears in the spot where you put the previous item, and this is where the strategy originates from. Not only do you need to create matches on a small board, you also need to plan ahead so that future pieces fit together and you can upgrade to, say, a castle. Matching the highest tiers will grant you a treasure chest. with random loot.Depending on the mode you play in (the game offers several with individual rulesets), there will also be bears. Bears wander around the board and turn into tombstones when you trap them. Three tombstones can be matched for a church (which does give you points) and three churches give you a cathedral. Building those is extra hard because the bears move around  and trapping them may require you to clutter the board.To make it easier, you are given a storage spot where you can swap and keep one item, and there are special components such as the bot (that removes any item from the board) and the gem (which works like a joker). There is also a shop where you can purchase items and components with gold that you get by making larger matches. This is strictly in the game, there are no in-app purchases or DLC.The other element of the game is your permanent capital city where you can place grain fields, military buildings, etc. which yield resources. These, too, can be matched and thus upgraded. If you play well, the game gives you rewards that can be put down in your capital.Overall, Triple Town is a deeper-than-it-looks match-3 game that gets quite addictive (further made ""worse"" by there being achievements!). It's a friendly game that does not get stressful (it's all turn-based). Sadly, while the iOS version got ratings in the 80s and 90s, the identical PC version scored much lower. Different audiences, I guess.I enjoy it, but I do like match-3 ganes, turn-based strategy and puzzlers. :)"

On a 6x6 board, you lay out tiles that merge into a ""better piece"" when three or more same pieces are matched. Since you build a city, this means you upgrade grass to bushes, bushes to trees, and then merge those into more and more advanced houses. Positioning your pieces is crucial because the upgraded piece appear on the tile you made the match, and with the very small board, you're constantly fighting for space. As if this wasn't enough, occasionally wandering bears will appear- you match those for cathedrals. A variant, the ninja bear, is even more distracting as it teleports around the board, and it can never be matched.A game ends when the board is filled, so each round is an attempt to beat your highest score- and earn resources for your ""main city"", which is a separate, larger map where you can match the earned resources into facilities and decorations.As simple as the idea sounds (you match... grass), the game is pretty good! Once you've got the mechanics down, a round may well last a while before you succumb to bears or that One Bad Match. The ""main city"" is a nice addition, too, gicing you something larger to work for. You need special tiles to create the main city elements, wich are earned in the actual levels, or you can just spend some (in-game) money to buy your next upgrade... or something that gives you an edge during a level.TT is not flashy. The music is minimal, the graphics are clean but rather functional, and apart from some ""Simlish"" mumble and bear growls you won't hear very much. It feels a bit barebones, really. You also only get four different board layouts, and since all game elements are revealed you don't have any reason to hunt for unlocks.But the fun thing is, it doesn't matter. Triple Towns is a great idea in a very slim, clean package. It plays really well and that's all that matters for me.For 10 Euros, TT is hard to recommend. There are more varied, more exiting, and more varied Match 3 games on Steam for that money.But! Keep it on your wishlish, wait for a sale or daily deal- and then get it. You won't regret your purchase."

It rewards you for getting better at it, with achievements and in-game rewards for scoring higher points. It makes you want to get good at it, because everything is easier: you get more points, more money, more assets and so forth. And sure, it's a Match 3 but you have an open grid to do whatever you want. Pretty neat. There are even little enemy bears (adorable mean fluffballs) to give you some amount of challenge.The cons: It's likely never going to see another update again, so this is the final product - and it's kind of a small shell and a basic game. Is there a quirk of the gameplay you dislike? Too bad. My personal axe to grind, is that it takes wayyy too long to feel like you're making progress in the game. There's a little map you can customize as you earn more points: you build things, and those little buildings generate rewards and points for you. The map is its own ongoing mini-game, the actual 'objective' of Triple Town. It's a neat little system: if it didn't take a thousand years to earn enough money to buy and build anything. I'm at over 100 hours on this thing (don't judge me). I'd expect to be rolling in dough right now, but I'm lucky if I can save up to 10K before having to spend it on something for my little map. So sometimes this map's progress feels like watching paint dry.It's a really cute game, though.

I always spend hours and hours on it and have a hard time stopping.It's really simple, but since the ""matches"" are generated randomly, it doesn't get boring, since the difficulty can really range. I feel like it absolutely challenges your brain, since sometimes arranging things can be tricky as Hell.I usually play this together with Slimmie in a call, and we have tons of fun, whenever I yell at the bears for being jerks. xDIf you see it reduced, you should get it. =)"

There are actually two modes of play - ""colonies"" where you attempt to make as many high-tier buildings as possible, which end when you run out of space, and a persistent ""mainland"" where you develop your Farm, Industry and Military using the earnings form the colonies. The interplay between the two modes keeps the game fresh for much longer.Out of all the puzzle games I've lost countless hours to, this one gets me ""just 5 more minutes"" nomination in the steam Awards."

I will eat your little peoples and so they run away screaming!Triple Town is the game I play when my mind needs a break. It's adorable and mindless and still puzzletastic. I love the different options of games. I also have this game on my mobile phone and tablet.Overall a fantastic waste of time, but not that horrible waste of time like Titanic. I'll never get those four hours back."

,Recommended,209950,28576209,"Posted: 23 December, 2016",all,Introverted Giant,"Triple town is a unique Match 3 puzzle game that requires use of spatial awareness and planning. Each turn you get a random item to place in your city, when three or more items connect they fuze into a new thing. You go from planting lowly grass to making houses and even castles which improve your score and provide a visual asthetic of people running around and talking gibberish. You also have bears and ninja bears that will block your progress and make things difficult for you. Managing all this is the key to victory, you will eventually fill your city and the game will end, but how you do will give you more things to improve your island which is a hub world you visit in between games. The game is cute and challanging and before you know it you will rack up a bunch of hours after thinking ""just one more game""."

You can buy items for your in between level map, but they're pretty expensive so you have to be careful what you pick.  One mistake placing something and you have to buy a crane to remove it with another item."

,Not Recommended,209950,34241483,Posted: 14 August,all,Kit,Merge 3 game - building up houses and getting points.  The graphics are nice and gameplay is reasonable - but they haven't thought out the progression system well at all.  You are simply given a base and access to all map types.  There is a money system but you earn so slowly it isn't really much use (as if it was built for mobile to get people to pay extra).I did have some enjoyable hours and it was almost a thumbs up from me until I played Merge Dragons on mobile which is 10 times better merge 3 game - great progression system with lots of lovely surprises.  Merge Dragons is freemium but I have played 30+ hours without any nagging for money/ads - so very subtle freemium.
