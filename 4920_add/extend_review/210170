76561197971948490,Not Recommended,210170,7940530,"Posted: 6 December, 2013",all,Wraith_Magus,"A game in the same vein as Lemmings, Spirits notably has far fewer powers to give your spirits.  This is because, unlike Lemmings, Spirits relies upon a sort of physics engine where windspeed is the most important factor, capable of replacing most of those mobility-boosting skills in Lemmings.  In theory, by using the capacity to shape windspeed by adding new currents to the mix, you can achieve subtle solutions to a wider range of problems with a smaller number of tools.... Too bad it doesn't work out.The main problem is that the game focuses heavily upon ""perfection"" in getting your spirits out, and that means you can't miss.  Unfortunately, the power you have to block wind flows through some areas are a total roll of the dice as to what they will actually do - sometimes, they block a passage you need blocked, other times, they bounce off some miniscule glitch in the geometry, and go flying into some random spot that winds up ruining your whole map, forcing you to reset.  Again.  And Again.  And Again.  Because, through no fault of your own, the game bugs up in specific spots, but you get punished for those things beyond your control.Then, there are missions where you have to blow spirits up and over spikes on the ground, but where there are also spikes on the ceiling - you need to carefully change the airflow to miss both... but then, there's really no means of judging where a spirit will go in those wind streams but for trial and error.  And if you mess up, start again.Did I mention that some of the later stages are quite long, and restarting restarts the whole level, where you can again be forced to reset due to geography glitches because those are, again, not under your control?  Yeah.Which brings me to what I ultimately have to rate the entire concept behind Spirits upon - Lemmings was a game about precision, which is why having very precise, very predictable effects worked for it.  Spirits adds in this system that demands precision randomness and a cloudiness where there's really no way to foresee what exact positioning of powers will just barely dodge the traps without trial-and-error gameplay.The original Lemmings was frustrating but fair.Spirits is just frustrating."

I mean kudos to the developers (if this was what they were trying to achieve) because this game seriously grinds your brain and will really test your patience and make you pay some serious attention to detail. I honestly can't tell if it's creative or if it just got lucky with how nit-picky the spirits are on the ground and how randomly they seem to move in the air.If you just want a puzzle game to relax with and casually play and aren't super concerned with perfect completion then sure, I'll recommend this game (do aim for the sale price).PS I am ashamed of how long it took me to realize something useful happens if you click on the spirits while they're in midair."
,Not Recommended,210170,29913420,Posted: 13 February,all,Maghook,"Spirits is very reminiscent of Lemmings. The little spirits can be inconsistent in their movement; sometimes one may land in a place that the others weren't able to, or they will walk through a blowing spirit - off a ledge - ruining the perfect score for that level. It's odd. I have to play in windowed mode as the game does not support my common multi-monitor setup; one corner of the game screen is blocking my mouse from accessing it, and one corner is stretched onto my second monitor. There are no graphic options. I just don't have the patience for games like this any more, especially with the little irritating issues that persist throughout the game."

If you prefer a more relaxed style of play, this would be right up your alley.Peaceful colors, peaceful music, cheerful little leaves waking up and walking in a most determined fashion towards certain doom, or possibly just a dead end that will make them knock into each other like they're in a zen mosh pit. Each of the spirits can be used in different ways to assist their fellows in escaping each level, a relatively stressless sacrifice unless you use too many of them and lose.I LIKE."

Its not a complete hassel if you have to start over for the sake of spirit saving. Good atmosphere and music. Simple but enjoyable game."
,Recommended,210170,21728594,"Posted: 9 March, 2016",all,Tamoose Aruse,"Spirits incites feelings of calmness, relaxation and fun as equally as it does frustration. ~7/10The beautiful glow effects and music give the game a sense of tranquility. However, you'll find if you don't enjoy trial & error, this sense of tranquility is quickly lost. Knowing the correct solution to a problem isn't always good enough, as the game demands a certain amount of perfection in execution. Despite this, I found myself striving to achieve perfect scores on each stage, motivated to increase my World Rank which is a great feature of this game. The later stages being as difficult and sometimes unforgiving as they are makes completing them all the more satisfying. Overall, I'd recommend this if you enjoy a game that is visually/musically rich and you enjoy problem-solving/trial & error."
,Not Recommended,210170,13443407,"Posted: 18 December, 2014",all,Vero,"This game has very little predictability, little visual interest, and repetitive music. I wanted to like it, but it was too unpredictable. I couldn't enjoy constantly restarting and constantly being told ""not enough spirits to complete level"" when the little guys would get stuck or act weird near a ledge or any other sharp angle.Not a game for completionists. Not a game for anyone."

It has a nice look and sound design but at it's core it's just Lemmings. if you liked Lemmings, then you'll like this, becasue it's Lemmings. For those of you who don't know what Lemmings is, I'll explain Spirits (and by extention lemmings) gameplay. There is a constant precesion of forward marching forest sprites who will walk straight into certain death if you let them. Your job is to undermind natural selection and save as many sprites as possible. You do this by killing certain sprites at the right time to cercumvent obsticals and create a path.So, yeah, it's alright. I liked it. it's nifty. fun even. There's just not a lot to say about it."

And Lemmings is not a game that needs to be non-deterministic at all.Ok, I want to blow spirits to that platform over there. I don't know where exactly to put my blowing spirit, nor what exact path the flying spirits will follow. That's fine with me. Guesscalculating, trial and error. What's not fine with me is that I finally figure it out and manage to send one spirit to that platform, then two... then the third, from exactly the same place and with the same direction, will hit the platform and fall down. Then some will get it, some will fail. Some will start moving in circles, some will break the loop, and so on...If this is already happening in the easy levels, I'm sorry, but I don't even want to try the difficult ones."
,Recommended,210170,2380037,"Posted: 4 September, 2012",all,Rascilon,"Spirits recalls the 90's classic Lemmings as you guide your wistful creations to the glowing vortex across landscapes filled with obstacles and dangers.  The game succeeds narratively and visually and does a superb job of introducing the player gradually to increasing complexity and difficulty.  The Steam Overlay and widescreen modes are supported, as are Steam Achievements.  Altogether Spirits is an attractive, polished Indie puzzle game that is both nostalgic, minimalist and innovative.  The developers should be congratulated for designing such a well rounded title.  Spirits should appeal to any indie gamers, and for the bargain price should have mainstream appeal as well."
,Recommended,210170,811520,"Posted: 6 September, 2012",all,mark | dj.,"Beautiful game with shallow Lemmings-like gameplay. Let the little buggers blow air, block air, build staircases or dig around, while you try and collect flowers, too.It's not as easy as you might think. But it isn't deep either.The current price is a bit steep, so my suggestion is to wait for a daily deal or something.[Rating: 71/100]"

Looks and feels like something you would find for free on a site with flash games. Definately don't buy unless it is on sale.
