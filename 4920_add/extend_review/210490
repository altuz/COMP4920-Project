The devs used an always-on DRM, and they dissolved without removing it. This is the sort of dickbag move that drives people to pirate games with such DRM instead of buying them."

I wanted to think that they'd got over the nags, but it really hasn't.4>  Not as pretty on second inspection - it looked too grainy, the movement was very forced and the environmentals got in the way of actually seeing character design.5> Intro sound / music... bleeerggghh...6> An engine that chuntered and spat like wet wood on a fire.I could go on, but I just don't want to anymore.  Frankly, this was my first real disappointment on Steam and I will be incredibly cautious around this developer from here on in.AVOID!!!"

This game was definitely not ready for release, and I would not even consider it ready for beta testing, yet here it is. It lacks simple UI and social features that one would expect within a modern game of this type (friends list, private matches, matchmaking) and its ""co-op"" listing is entirely PvP. They also require you to use a secondary login system in order to play, and registering at their site tells you the game is still in Alpha and that you should receive a second key soon. Unfortunately this is both true and false. The game IS very much in alpha state but they are not providing second copies of the game. I do not advise buying it, though I do hope it can recover from it's pre-mature release and bounce back with some enjoyable gameplay. Someday. But it has been over a week now and there is little word on how they plan to resolve this.Purchase Frozen Synapse instead."
