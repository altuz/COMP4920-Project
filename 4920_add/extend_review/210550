And there's these space piggies, like mean green little space piggies up in the sky.  And these birds, the birds in space, the angry ones, they see these mean green piggies, and I kid you not, I see them fling themselves as the piggies.  It's the most goshdarned thing I've ever seen through my telescope.  And that's not the crazy part.  The crazy part is, I don't think they're just in space.  I think they're on other planets, too.  And these birds, they can fly.  No, I mean, really, really fly.  Not like birds down here, the ones that flap around like la la la la la, or just soar around, you know the eagles and falcons and the like.  No, these birds, they don't seem to like gravity.  They just kind of float and bounce.  But the planets, see, they like the planets, and they fly down to them.  Sometimes it makes them miss the piggies, and they gotta send more birds in.  And sometimes, the birds smash into blocks of ice and wood and stone and stuff, and I swear I saw one fly itself into an asteroid, and it broke into a million jillion like bits, good gravy!  Now, now, I mean the space rocks, not the birds, no.  Never seen a bird in space blow up, before.  Until I saw this one bird...naw, shouldn't talk about that.  You might be eatin' your supper.So, thought I should tell you.  There's birds up there, you know in the Good Lord's heavens.  And they're angry.  Not sure what they're angry about, but you outta know about it, in case you go sticking your head up in the clouds or flying in one of the danged Virgin Galactic deathtraps or whatever.  And warn those NASA fellas, if you can.  Don't want no space shuttle runnin' into no birds on the way to Venus or something."

I also like it because there isn't any power ups (believe it or not) because I always feel bad when I acidently press a power up button and waste a power up, and it makes more of a challenge. I also like it that the restart button is close to the pause button so I can quick and easily restart the level. I also like it that there is no adds in the pause menu so I don't have to look at adds about breakfest.also NitroWombat reported me when I was asking him a question about his review, he said I insulted a fact, and blocked me so I couldn't talk back, so NitroWombat, I'm sorry for whatever I did wrong."

It seems to work well on the PC, but it's just this style of Angry Birds I don't like. I enjoyed the original on my iPhone and wanted to idley sling birds into things and smash them up. Sadly this is not possible with this version of the game because it's all about solving (sometimes tricky) puzzles. If you like that sort of thing I see nothing wrong with the game though. I realised it was set in space but (perhaps naively) didn't realise there'd be all this no gravity meaning you have to work out where to aim (no where near what you want to smash) with complex gravitational effects."

Angry Birds Space is a brilliant adaptation to the Angry birds franchise, bringing new gameplay elements and tons of fun. I love the new Ice Bird and how all the Original Birds have been given superpowers to fit the Sci-Fi theme. It does certainly bring new life to the franchise and is very fun almost better than the other games."
