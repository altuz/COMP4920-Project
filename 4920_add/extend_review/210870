I did (and still am) and so far it's really fun. I thought, if they could beat the game, so could I. Challenge accepted. I always love to subject myself to side-scrolling-platformer (and in a sense, occasionally puzzle) games, because I'm usually not that good at them. You want to stop playing the game, but every level you beat makes you want to keep playing. It's so entertaining!"

Before the review starts, I would like to say YES do buy this game, it is so much fun. Anyways, onto the review!Cloudberry Kingdom is a game with infinitely generated levels. Every single level is possible to beat, no matter the challenge. The AI can show you the path through the level, if you're not so sure. There is a story line, but I don't really pay much attention to it. Mostly what matters are the levels themselves. There are quite a few power-ups you can be, which affect the gameplay in big ways. Most notable is the spaceship power-up, which I quite dislike. All the others are pretty fun to play with, such as the double jump, jetpack, hero-in-a-box, and a few more. Most of the powerups are quite enjoyable, but still, that ship power-up? No thanks. The graphics are nothing to write home about, just a cartoony style perfect for a game like this. Overall, I'd rate this game 8/10, mostly for it's replayablility. But, the spaceship, I HATE THE SPACESHIP LEVELS UGG- Anyways, yea, buy this game, it is gr8!"

It can be played both casual or intensely with an assortment of different ways of playing the game. My favourite so far has been the arcade mode.

Now that I can play it here, I am still loving it.Review time.The game is randomly generated, I don't know about most people but I have no need for progression, the free-play mode is more than enough to keep me coming back to it. And as I play in spurts, I have to start over at training difficulty each time I start playing intensively, and the game adapts and gives you more of a challenge as it goes on. With that said, it is extremely rewarding when you finish a brutal level. The game is very challenging and has endless replay value to me as the game is different every time I play."

These levels get harder and harder as you go on. While you're in these levels, you can collect gems that allows you to slow down time, be shown where to go, and see a bot do it.The story mode has you go through these levels with different twists like double jumping, being big or small, and being stuck in a wheel. It also has a pretty cool intro animation.The Arcade Mode has you go against everyone's score. You can chooses to do it with only double jumps or only being big or having nothing. Score is based on all the gems you get. If you get all the gems in the level, your score multiplier will go up. If you die or don't collect all the gems, this will go down. Currently, I'm addicted to this mode.Marathon Mode lets you go through a long level after level where you choose the difficulty based on all the monsters in there.Overall, the idea of improving your skill by upping the difficulty really makes you want to play the game again and again, especially with a high score. If you want a game with tons of replayability, get this!"

It’s fun but eventually wears on you as all you really have to do to pass any level is just run and time your jumps accordingly. There is really no challenge to be had other than memorizing a particular levels jump patterns. As for the randomly generated levels, unlike a game like Rogue Legacy, the randomization hurts the overall experience. If it were designed with a more careful hand the game would have been much better as each level could have presented something unique. As you advance further you will continually see the same type of level over and over again. I would recommend only for the hardcore platformer crowd and even then I would say wait for the inevitable sale price."

Although the controls and hitboxes are not as spot on as Super Meat Boy, and every now and then you'll be hating the game for cheap deaths (saws that miss you as model but do hit your hitbox etc). When you think of it this game for a large part is a rythem game, there is one way to solve a level, and in most cases waiting to analyse and obstacle isn't an option, you just have to flow through. The soundtrack is killer, different hero's provide variation. Overall I'd say a solid 7/10, it's good, but just not as tight in controls as Super Meat Boy."

It is a platformer with different versions or modes of the hero with distinct abilities. The levels always generate as you play so you won't get the same level twice in arcade mode. The only complaint I have is the graphics for the game/hero could be a little better. Some of the levels are so tight with where you need to be it puts the original NES platformers to shame!

,Recommended,210870,811523,"Posted: 4 August, 2013",all,mark | dj.,"A game that is pretty similar to Super Meat Boy. It's uglier and allows you to use power-ups though, so it's also, in a way, easier. Power-ups like slowing down time or letting the computer show you the way to proceed will help you get through the many, many levels.I think there are about 240 levels in total, but each level can usually be finished within 30 seconds (if you don't die, that is, which doesn't happen all that often).The levels get trickier the further you get and you are introduced to new game mechanics along the game. All these things ease you into the game, and by the time you're playing level 160 or so you probably know how to work your way around the levels. No, it doesn't make it any easier, on the contrary, but I salute the developers for not throwing you into the deep right away. It makes the game more accessible for anyone who wants to give it a go. And since the levels are short, it hardly ever becomes frustrating. But if it keeps you interested for that long, that's an entirely different story.In all honesty though, I still prefer Super Meat Boy because of the better visuals and tighter controls but Cloudberry Kingdom is a fine runner-up. I like you sadistic platformers add this one to your wishlist.[Rating: 72/100]"

This is a very simple, fun and challenging game that doesn't need a plot. The techno music is catchy while the difficult levels abuse you and there are different modes other than just 'make you very angry'. You can customize your character,  The story mode is fun to see how far you can absolutely make it, there's an arcade mode that's like a marathon, and many different types at that, like trying to speed through the level as a timer constantly goes down. And my favorite of all is the custom mode where you can set the degree of difficulty with different obstacles to the point where your entire screen is moving with some sort of hazard. And to top it all off, different ways you can play as your character, like a mini or giant mode, a space ship, or even bouncing. If you like wasting away hours on challenging platformers, this is certainly for you."

I think I know why it hasnt done to well though.Ive just played again after over a year away from the game, and I played super meat boy last night, and ther just isnt any flow in the platforming here. Actually there is the complete oposite. with the levels being random, there are multiple times per level where you may have to hop on the spot, or completely stop and take a step backwards to get where you need to go.This completely takes away the flowing nature of super tight platformers, which i think is THE core mechanic.Its a shame really.

Tutorial completed, now get out and die. A lot.When the mechanics are so simple, the quality of the game is only determined by the maniability and the level design. Both are gems.Level are so well made, platforms and swinging spiked blocks are are put together with a millimetric precision so you can run through the entire level without pausing, but a millisecond of hesitation will mean your death. While playing this game, it reminded me of Rayman Legends/Origins. That's the biggest compliment a platformer could dream of.This game is never unfair, there is always an evident way to maneuver through all the hazards and your character responds well, so stop accusing the game and try again. Then when you manage that perfect run through the 50 blocks, spikes and flamethrowers... that's just so satisfying you can't stop.Levels are extremely short, and that makes the game really addictive. Wow, already 50 levels ? ok, 10 more levels and I stop. Then 10 more. Then 10 more...Only nitpick, on some levels you will get a new gimmick, like a wheel or a pogo.

It is well worth the millions of times you will die to experience. One of, if not the best 2D platformer for the last 10 - 15 years."

The game is great and much more enjoyable playing with a bunch of friends (capable of 4 player co-op), it really lends itself to local multiplayer.I would recommend this game 40% casual and 60% intense - it's fun to pick up n play with friends."

Take on the role of Bob, a retired hero, as you run, duck, jump, double jump, jetpack, fly, bounce, pogo, gravity flip, roll, and rocket your way through story mode, or try your hand at one of the 4 arcade modes that will test your ability to adapt and react to any situation.  Whatever you do, be prepared to die, for once you have begun your journey, there is no mercy to be found.Plus, one of the outfit color options is ""invisible""."

Because the levels are dseigned to be speed-run, sometimes they feel a little. . . too perfect. But overall defenitely enjoyed my time, even if I never broke top 100 of the leaderboard I was gunning for."
