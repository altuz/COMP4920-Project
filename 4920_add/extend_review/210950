The gameplay remains solid even compared to newer games of the same genre.  There are 15 weapons to use.  There's puzzles to solve.  Then there's food to eat and ale to guzzle when you're wonded from the slaughtering.  The multiplayer still works, though there are a few tweaks and quirks to fiddle with depending on whether or not you use a router or have custom firewall settings in order to play with others on Steam version servers.  There are a number of older version servers running and active that Steam users can join and play on.I recommend this game to anyone that likes full 360 degree splatterhouse games."

,Recommended,210950,17118490,"Posted: 18 July, 2015",all,ThatDarnOwl,"Looking back on the early 2000s, there was usually one thing that most 3D games of the time had in common. The gameplay was occasionally very awkward, and for the most part they didn't age all that well.Rune is one of the few exceptions to the rule. And it's almost fascinating how it's still a very playable and enjoyable experience today. Rune takes place in a fantasy world inspired by Norse mythology. What impresses me about this game is how interactive the levels are. It's a very immersive game filled with things like trees that react to the player running by them, bushes that move as you walk through them. All done before physics middleware like Havok, when everything needed to be hand animated in the Unreal 1 engine.While the storyline is pretty goofy, the combat is still very fast and viceral. It is a brutally simple hack and slash and this contributed to how well this game aged, and fits in very nicely with the Viking motifs that run throughout the game.This re-release of Rune on Steam comes with a fix for the multiplayer, enhanced resolution support, and Steamworks achievements. In many ways Rune is the definition of a hidden gem, a diamond in the rough. One you discover one day, and wonder why you never noticed it before.http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=484569919"

,Recommended,210950,12457735,"Posted: 11 October, 2014",all,Murikov,"Rune is definitely a hidden gem from the early 2000s, a must-play for fans of Norse Mythology. It's basically a 3rd person hack 'n slay title garnished with some interesting jumping/crawling sections, here and there even with some simple puzzles. The action is raw and gory, decapitated enemies are a common sight too. Expect some pixel blood to flow.The level design is pretty decent as well, ranging from mysterious, creature-infected dungeons over to goblin working settlements or viking-populated fortresses. Again, expect many severed limbs and other body parts on those premises.The only downside in my opinion is the more or less unspectacular final section of the game and the ending. The developers could have done a better job, but some other players may have a different view on this one.The Good:+ Decent story and level design+ Graphics (they were good at the time)+ Authentic Viking setting and atmosphere+ Fast-paced and uncomplicated gameplay+ Gore and Blood+ MultiplayerThe Bad:- The latest sections in the game feel quite unpolished and rushedThe Ugly:- Some issues on modern systems like sudden freezes. But I blame Steam for this, not the developers.Overall a truly pleasant hackfest experience, you'll definitely enjoy it.8/10"

So, what did I think?I freaking LOVE this game! It reminds me of Severance: Blade of Darkness/Enclave, which I enjoyed in my youth. Graphically it holds up all right and you can still make out what is what. The story is good and works to motivate you to continue, even if it is rather simple. The Norse setting and theme is good even if certain structures and characters don't always portray that. When facing other Vikings you get taunted with things like, 'I'm going to drink mead from your skull' and 'Look, a troll has wandered in from the cold', which adds to the immersion and causes me to smile.There is much plat-forming in this game, with ledge climbing/jumping and rope/chain climbing. Some can be tricky but enjoyable.Combat is, well ok. Not brilliant but it gets the job done; satisfying when you hack/slice limbs and heads off. Enemy AI is quite shocking and sometimes they just stand still and let you kill them. This just makes me laugh, it was made in 2000 after all.Overall a great plat-forming, hack 'n' slash action-adventure game. It has its flaws yet I cannot get enough of it. Make sure to grab the mod that adds back the missing levels that were cut from the Gold version. Makes sense to play the full game.8/10"
,Recommended,210950,9768147,"Posted: 8 April, 2014",all,George A.,"As I kick off my slightly longer, more detailed reviews on some of my Steam games, it's only appropriate that I start with a game that was part of my youth.Rune is, surprisingly enough, one of the few games focusing on Norse mythology that made it into history. Not many good and consistent ones out there, and this one brings its own identity in terms of gameplay, aesthetics, and character development. It creates its own accounting of Norse cultural and religious topoi in fiction, and that does more good than harm as far as the storyline progression is concerned. You play as Ragnar, a young man whose responsibilities escalate with the killing of his kinsfolk and the dooming of his birthplace, Wotankeld. Simple name for a protagonist, simple purpose for his endeavour. Vengeance couldn't be bitterer and more predictable.But that's where things get sharp in Rune. You're introduced to fluent combat mechanics, advanced graphics for the time (the first Unreal Engine was just starting its brilliant run), and the grandeur of the game's environmental variety. This is a videogame epic tale, with all its classic characteristics, as the protagonist rises through the image of the savior and avenger of his clan and descends into the dark realms of Helgrind, imprisoned, assuming the figure of bare life and shamanistic sacrifice - true to the Norse notion of the Cosmogonic death in order to attain the knowledge of the Runes; Wotan speared onto Yggdrasil -, to then rise again as the ultimate Berserkr who transcends revenge and defies material existence. Ragnar is ready to put it on the line at every moment. And that motif is auxiliary to the development of the game's combat system, a hack-n'-slash which is as smooth as it gets, and a map configuration that challenges the player's reasoning as well as it puts them under the pressure of claustrophobia and constant darkness.This is an atmospheric game, and a grim one as it is. The double ending is up to you, and that's a bonus coming from an action game with tacit storytelling elements. Rune scores high in both single-player and multiplayer - which is still active, and resembles heavily the fun and flow of the Unreal deathmatches -, and the variety of weapons, as well as the distinct styles and contrast in movement swiftness that each one of them brings up, enrich the game even further.A must-have for hack-n'-slash fans, as well as fans of games that dialogue with the epic genre."

I havn't seen that in games before, and its AWESOME. The game is pretty cheap on steam too, and it can run on low end computers as well, so everyone can have fun! The multiplayer is great as well, although all the american servers are dead, there is a small european community that welcomes newcomers. I'm from Texas, and i was able to play in the european servers without lagging at all!   Also did i say that the multiplayer loading screen is really cool?

Depending on player actions at the end of the game it offers two possible endings.Graphical it's dated game but some locations still have nice design. Audio is done ok with average voice acting and some good backround music that is played in key moments of the game.Combat is probably the best part of the game with quite demanding skirmishes, often with multiple enemies. Even on normal mode you can easily and literally lost your head.Ragnar the main hero of the game can use four types  of weapons: swords,axes,hammers and maces.He can also use shields and rune power that each weapon has. But if you are bored of fighting with normal gear you can always grab a limb or head that your dead opponent have lost in the duel and use it against other enemies!There's also multiplayer mode where you can prove your skills in the combat against other players. It's challenging but at the same time quite fun to play.If you are a fan of tpp action games and like Norse mythogy then it's in my opinion a must have in your Steam library."

The fact that this game is so old makes it even more fun for me to play even now. It's hilarious when you chop your enemy's weapon arm off, because now thay have no arm, so all they can do is run! In a multiplayer match you can start to feel super awesome as you find things on the map with high damage and other items that increase your health, and so on and so forth.The game's graphics and animations aren't what this game is good for. Its great because the combat is so simple, yet so hard and complicated to use at times.Even though the game still has open online servers, no one really plays on them anymore. The people who actually play this game online is more like a community of 10-20 people who all know eachother because they met online in Rune.Even though the servers aren't really populated anyomre, it means that you can usually find a server and play it with your friends usually without the worry of anyone else joining it.Even if you don't like the multiplayer there's still an AMAZING storyline with a very awesome Norse setting, and it really does make you feel like an epic viking warrior. I won't spoil any of the actual storyline, but the story itself is very epic.The story mode is also great because the difficulty of the campaign does start to get increaseingly difficult, but how does your character level up? Its simple. He doesn't.You never level up with skill points, and you don't have an inventory, its just a hack and slash adventure going through the game. You get tougher by finding slightly better weapons slowly throughout the game, as well as items that increase your health a tiny bit and what not. But, even with those better weapons, enemies are still always gaining in difficulty, as they could still kill you in only a few hits. In the beginning of the game, enemies are no real threat and are killed easilly with your weak starting weapons. But near the end of the game, even though you have the best weapons that you can get, enemies are extremely difficult to kill sometimes and can take you out easilly if your not careful.Overall, I highly recommend this game to anyone, especially if you like games based on a Norse setting."

A brutal, fun and unique hack n slash game with great enemy and level variety with a awesome soundtrack that just sets the mood so well. The levels are done in a old school shooter way, which means they are big and there's a lot of them! You have several types of weapons and multiple different tiers within those types. You also have  powers by collecting Runes which depending on the weapon do certain magical abilities. The voice acting works, sort of a cheesy action movie style, the art direction and armor designs are a sort of gothic meets viking style which is pretty awesome and memorable. There's even a awesome mod that allows you to play the campaign in coop or even download some of the custom campaigns to play together. This game truly is a hidden gem within the genre, something if you're a fan of action and adventure games or Hack n Slash you shouldn't miss it. There's also a fun multiplayer mode and the game runs great on modern systems.All in all, a lot of fun, exciting and easily replayable.

76561198115503354,Recommended,210950,10725167,"Posted: 23 June, 2014",all,Green Eggs and Lamb (Peter),"So after playing this for a couple days I think this game deserves some attention. And I used to play this a long time ago in 2002 at it's time this game was considered ""advanced"" it's basically 2001's version of Skyrim (the only problem is there is no free roam,) but now things these days look close to real life I highly doubt this will compete with the other games you might consider getting. Now before I get into detail no not the kind of attention Halo: CE and Half Life get, this game is fun but that's about it there isn't a HUGE deep story behind this game so don't expect something like Halo or Half Life just expect the typical 1990 ""kill everything in your path"" kind of game.Story/plot: The story begins with an introduction saying Odin the all father gave humanity great powerful lucky charms--*Ahem!* I mean rune stones to hold Ragnarock at bay. However the evil god Loki has attempted many times to unleash Ragnarock by destroying these runes.So instead of constantly fighting him every generation Odin had enough of his ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t so he ended up tearing Loki's heart out and banished him into a dungeon like hell. But even with his magic power stripped away and imprisoned he managed to corrupt a handful of mortals to join his wicked demonic army. This then leads to a showdown between the corrupt and evil vikings, and a village's chief and son Ragnar (you the player are Ragnar) so the village's best warriors were all slaughtered in merely seconds by magic bolts of lightning summoned by Loki's herald (I know I'm writing a review but there are no characters in this game besides Loki Ragnar and Odin so I can't remember his name currently) everyone dies including Ragnar's father.However Odin revives Ragnar and says that he is giving Ragnar a chance at revenge if he can save the rune stones and stop Loki's return. Ragnar of course without a moment of thought accepts the offer and fights his way through monsters, demons, undead, to hell and back all the way into the mountains fighting vikings, dwarves, giants, and the list goes on! you eventually become a war lord through your journey and now you must travel to Loki's dungeon and finish the fight the gods started.I won't spoil the rest but there is a lot to fight in this game which makes me disappointed that at the time we didn't have the proper technology to make a free roaming game. Because this universe has tons of potential! this is REAL norse mythology! not like Skyrim where everyone worships made up half naked bikini models that enjoy watching people bang. I would love to see more of this but in a free roaming world or at least an anniversary edition with new graphics and textures along with a lot of polishing.This game may end on the very first installment but it deserves a modern RPG sequel (or prequel) anything can be done in this universe the IP is there we just need a new developer building or re-building this universe.Multiplayer: it's fun but very competitive, there is no ""help me"" or ""power upgrades"" or tanks, there is nothing to give you an edge over everyone else in the match. It's classic skill vs skill who is the better man? (or woman) basically multiplayer is thunder dome ""two men enter, one man leaves...And respawns again to get his♥♥♥♥♥kicked"" so it's fun but it's not the best multiplayer I've seen in early 2000 games. The other question you might ask is: ""is there customization?"" yes, and a bit of no, there are skins/playermodels (however you want to call it) you can change into but there is no armor customization you can unlock and dress up in, or mix and match pieces of sets. (I think there are skin mods but I'm not too sure they're safe to download) but if you want to mod in your own skin I support the idea 100% the game could use a fix here and there.Final verdict: I'm giving the game a 7/10 now if this was 2004 or something I would have given it an 8 but this game is extremely outdated and old. So, does it belong in your library? yes and no, it depends what your computer can run. And there are better games out there that you can spend 10$ or less on. It's still a great game though, believe me I still love this game to this very day! but it's not a perfect game, as far as modern preferences go. I would love to see more, a complete free roaming RPG could be adapted into this universe giving a new fresh nordic IP, hell if it has Co-op mode, free roaming, and competitive multiplayer, it might even beat Skyrim! but until then we have to wait and see."

,Recommended,210950,14674303,"Posted: 27 February, 2015",all,Hans Brotmeister,"This review contains events of the very beginning of the game and names a few enemy types. Other than that it is spoiler-free.Rune Classic is a re-release of the original hack&slash game called Rune. You play as the young Viking Ragnar who just gets into the status of a warrior as the story begins. Ragnar's village is one of the villages that are built around special rune stones. Those stones were created by the god Odin to keep his son Loki in his prison and thus preventing the great cataclysm that would follow if Loki was to be released. The warriors of Ragnar's village belong to an order called the Odinsblade. It is their duty to protect the rune stones from all harm. When Ragnar is just accepted into the Odinsblade the people of Ragnar's village learn that an allied village guarding on of the rune stones is being attacked and immediately set out to intervene. On their way they run into the viking Conrack who was responsible for the attack. Conrack is in league with Loki and is hellbent on destroying every single rune stone to release him into the world. Due to the powers that were granted to Conrack by Loki the people of Ragnar's village are no match for him and he sinks their ship. Ragnar gets rescued by Odin and makes it to an undersea cave. With nobody else having survived the battle it's on Ragnar to keep Conrack from destroying the stones. But to do that he has to make his way back to the surface.Rune Classic is played in the third person perspective. There are various weapons to be found. They are separated into three classes: swords, maces/hammers and axes. There are five weapons in each class, three being one-handed and two of them being two-handed. One-handed weapons can be used alongside with a shield. You can hold shields in front of you to block incoming damage but they also offer passive protection if you are hit on the side where you are carrying the shield. Shields' stability decreases as they are hit and they are eventually destroyed. Most weapons have different attack animations depending on the direction Ragnar is moving while executing the attack. Some of the heavier weapons like two-handed hammers are restricted to overhead strikes only though. If you have ever played Jedi Knight 2: Jedi Outcast you have a basic understanding how the combat in Rune Classic plays out. In addition to different speed, damage and attack animations every weapon has a unique rune power that can be activated using rune energy. Rune powers ranger can be offensive, defensive or utility oriented. The combat in Rune Classic also features dismemberment. If aimed well it is possible to cut off enemies heads or limbs. Those can be picked up and be used as weapons. While there are no ranged weapons in the game Ragnar is able to throw his weapon. Luckily Ragnar is able to carry one of each weapon in the game, so he is able to draw a replacement after having thrown his initial weapon.Ragnar has two resources: health and rune energy. While he is carrying a shield the shield's stability is also represented by a bar making it kind of a third resource. Health can be replenished by eating fruit, lizards or meat or by drinking mead. Rune energy is replenished by picking up energy runes that are scattered throughout the levels. Different weapons' rune powers have different energy costs ranging from energy cost equal to one rune pickup to emptying the complete energy bar. Shield stability is replenished by picking up additional shields what is not very realistic but quite comfortable. The maximum shield stability is dependent on the type of shield Ragnar picks up with heavier shields obviously having more stability. Ragnar can increase his maximum health by picking up health runes which he can find from time to time. Some of the health runes are placed in obvious places while some of them are missable when not paying attention. If you find all health runes in the game Ragnar's maximum health is twice as as high as the initial value.The enemies in Rune Classic features a variety of enemies. There are fairly weak ones like crabs or goblins but also stronger ones like undead, vikings, ice giants and dwarves. Even the weaker enemies are able to drain Ragnar's health pretty quickly if they land an attack combination though. Thus it is only advisable to stay next to an enemy if you know you can kill them before they can retaliate. Most of the time it is better to stick with hit-and-run tactics, going in for one or two quick attacks before retreating again. Alternatively it is possible to circle a single enemy to permanently stay out of their attack range. Depending on the enemy type this can be rather difficult though. Ragnar's life is not only threatened by enemies though since some of the levels are littered with traps. Some traps can be activated manually and used against enemies. However, the enemies can and will do the same if given the chance.Being mostly about combat Rune Classic features some platforming elements. Those are fairly easy though because Ragnar can hang on to ledges an pull himself up. There are also minor puzzle elements like flipping switches or creating a path by destroying the environment. Ragnar is able to destroy certain doors and weakened walls or supports. If you find yourself in a place where you don't know where to go it is advisable to first look for something to climb, then for something to destroy.The multiplayer is fairly straight forward. There are four modes: Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, Arena and Headball.  While the first three modes are fairly self-explanatory headball revolves around trying to cut off the opponents' heads and then throwing it into the goal to score. While the game can be played online Rune Classic also features LAN functionality.As opposed to the original version some changes have been made in Rune Classic. Some levels have received are slight redesign while some others have been cut out to improve the pacing and make the game less grindy. I can see why this was done since the game is fairly long and especially the beginning tended to drag. If you want to play the missing levels there is a fully compatible mod out there that restores them. Further Rune Classic introduced some new enemies into the game that before were only featured in the later released Playstation version. Additionally this version has gamepad support although in my opinion it is played better with mouse and keyboard.Despite being an older game Rune Classic pretty much runs out of the box. There are two oversights though. First depending on your operation system there may be problems with sound positioning. It is a shame since Rune Classic's sound design is even today very atmospheric. There has been an unofficial fix for this but that got lost after the shutdown of the site that featured it. If it re-appears this guide will be updated to include a link. The second oversight is a certain section very far into game where entering a cutscene makes the game crash, at least on certain systems. This can be circumvented by switching the game sound off until after the cutscene. Luckily this is a cutscene in which nobody is talking anyway.There is on other minor gripe I have with the game. Sometimes triggering a certain event is required to progress. This is not an issue in most cases but some triggers are placed a little awkwardly. So if you don't know how to progress make sure you have actually been everywhere.In summary Rune Classic still holds up pretty well. It is an enjoyable mix of visceral third person combat with a huge variety of weapons and powers and some platforming and puzzle elements. If you like hack&slash games or action adventures you should definitely give it a try.More reviewshere"

Gameplay is very similar to the original; however, there are a few noticeable changes.- In the single player campaign, many of the levels have been shortened and some have been removed completely.  This does help keep the game moving along (especially in the first cavern areas); though, fans of the original game will likely notice a few memorable areas missing.- A few new enemies have been added: skeletons, hellhounds, and frost giants.- Some of the weapon rune powers have been swapped.  For example, the viking short sword now has the vampire rune power, and the viking broad sword now has the befriend rune power.Overall, I still like the game.  The only complaint I have is that a couple bugs have not yet been fixed (as of version 1.10).- In the cave area just after Ragnar gets off the large beetle, there is a cliff area that will kill Ragnar if any items (weapons, shields, body parts, etc.) fall into it.- Near the end of the game, there is a cinema scene where the sarks are breaking through a wall with hammers.

Now pop the res up to 1600x1200 and let the dismemberment begin !!!  I don't think there has ever been another game quite like this. The level design is very diverse and the mechanics for knocking out supports, climbing, smashing doors, swimming, and even trampolines were quite innovative for their time and are still great fun today. It still boggles sometimes on how to progress through certain areas. You need to really concentrate on EVERY part of the environment to progress. The sense of exploration is almost like early Tomb Raider games. AND you get to drink mead and eat lizards  . . ... mmm-mmmm good !  Worth every penny, especially if you get it on sale. Pure hack-n-slash goodness."

Funnily enough, it's still just as fun and captivating as the first time I played it years ago. This is one of the best Viking games there is.It has action combat and platforming puzzles. Sometimes it can be quite difficult, as health pick ups are limited and scattered. Exploration is rewarded sometimes with rare runes that increase your health or rune power permenantly. Othertimes you might find much needed simple health and rune pickups and weapons you don't have yet.The story by now is a bit cliche but it holds true to Norse mythology rather well. I wish more games were developed like this one."

No magical lightning or Spawn-like chain attacks, your manly biceps and massive id are all the magic you need to cut a bloody swath through your enemies. Oh, and you can jump *any time you want*. No carebear invisible walls keeping you from falling off a cliff into lava so hot it would burn your unmatched viking beard down to a Kratos-size stub before you even hit it.

However, I felt lost in a few of the levels. I couldn't figure out where to go and went in circles for a few minutes. One level was literally a corner you'd never check, but it isn't too terrible.Also, the engine REQUIRES some tweaking. Modern hardware will cause this game to act very strange.

The combat is chancy at times, but if you pay attention to its mechanics you can start using each detail to your advantage.Rune includes magnificent storytelling, superb voiceacting, exploration-based linear maps and a fairly significant amount of clean platforming.But Be Warned: If you're a graphics-nut, this game might be hard on the eyes.To me, it's beautiful and everything it should be, but I am aware that some people aren't fond of such... classic graphic representations.Vikings, Swords, Runepowers, Gods, More swords, and some hellish enemy creatures that you'll surely come to love/hate.
