However, for chess players everywhere who wants a game to compete in then please stay away from this game, stay farrrrrr away.Newbies in the game will have a fairly challenging time playing against the AI but for veterans in the art the AI will look like the ultimate morron you don't wat to play with. The game will be decepting initially as dozens of openings have been loaded in the program to make it look like the game actually knows how to play. Indeed if chess simply consisted of knowing how to move each piece and a set of opening move lists then it's a good game but sadly chess is not such a simple game. After the opening sequences the AI just fumbles about and you will later realize that the only real good thing in this game is its graphics.No multiplayer in this game. I'm sure someone would defend it and say that there is but let's face the fact that without a lobby and a working matchmaking feature it might as well not have any. For something that's so dependent on multiplayer it's outstanding that the team that created this game greatly neglected the multiplayer interface. The only way you can connect with someone is by knowing their IP which means you can only play with friends and the truth is if you're here on steam playing chess, it pretty much means you're alone in that circle of friends with that same taste in board games. This means for most of the game you will be playing alone and you will get bored... a lot.While playing alone there are mini games you can play. The classic chess, and other challenges like giving a checkmate with only a king and a rook. This is good practice for beginners while a good laugh for seasoned players. However, other than that, the other minigames are just bad. Other than the challenges I suggest you stay far away from the other minigames cause it will not help you get better at the game called chess and instead help you get better at mashing your head with your keyboard.So for who can I recommend this game? If you liked the brutal chess matches shown in Harry Potter Sorcerer's Stone then you might want to try this one. If not, and you're just looking for a program to hook up with friends and strangers and play the game then please do yourself a favor and close this page because this game is not for you."

The graphics were already very outdated when it was made, the animations are dull and ugly, the ""kills"" aren't funny, the camera interface isn't very interactive and it moves in a rough way and the CPU thinking is very slow.

Dà seri problemi durante l'avvio a numerose persone, è privo di un vero multiplayer e combattere contro la CPU di massimo livello ( 9 ) in schermaglia vi costerà 4 ore reali di tempo per singola mossa ( è il tempo dato alla CPU per pensare con una profondità di 15 mosse ).

,Recommended,211050,9952355,"Posted: 27 April, 2014",all,Karnovo,"IntroductionThe ancient game of chess has many forms. It was one of the first board games in the world and almost everyone is familiar with it's rules. Because of the game's fame, it would come to no surprise that there has been many chessgames since the existence of the game industry. In 1998 the first Battle Chess appeared, a game in which chess pieces were brought to life and fought fiercefully against each other.Now the developer TopWare Interactive brings us Battle vs. Chess, which takes this principle of alive slaughtering pieces to a whole new level by delivering better animations, tons of game modes and online gameplay.StorylineYou might not think it would, but Battle vs. Chess has indeed a storyline. The campagin tells the story of the eternal battle between good and evil. The white pieces are members of 'Order' alias Heaven and the black pieces are members of 'Chaos' alias Hell. Both sides have their own campaign which is explained by means of voice acting and occasionally some animations. Let me also add that you shouldn't expect any thought-through cutscenes.Each mission starts the same. After a brief intro is shown, which for example tells you that your troops are being attacked in the middle of the night, the chess game can begin. Every time you'll get a limited number of pieces to work with, for example, a king and five pawns. With these pieces you will have to defeat the opponent's pieces, which vary as well. The variation of chess pieces and win conditions will challenge even the most insightful. So a warning seems to be in place. The difficulty is in fact pretty high.Learning ChessDespite it's high difficulty newcomers to chess should not worry. There is a surprisingly comprehensive tutorial available that explains all the rules of the game. Through all kinds of diagrams and illustrations you can find out how each chess piece moves on the board. There are also some mini games that will help you with understanding the rules of chess. There is for example a game where you only control one horse and the goal is to get to a certain point on the board in as few moves as possible. After learning how each seperate chess piece behaves it's recommended to start using the whole set of pieces. You will again be faced with certain situations you need to solve in just one or more rounds. This whole setup is ideal beginners to understand the game on a different level. Let me also add that experencied players will surely benefit from this  interactive way of learning, because after a while you will be confronted with some tremendously tricky puzzles.Game ModesIn all modes, you will see a brief fight animation between the conflicting chess pieces. The camera will zoom in on the violence that is taking place and it will trigger the start of a short minigame. In this mini game you will see a real battle between the two pieces in question, but how you win it can vary greatly. It all depends on which fighting style you picked.In the beginning of a game of Battleground you get to pick which type of fighting style you prefer. It can either be Duel or Slasher.The Duel fighting style is similar to Guitar Hero, where you'll have to push the buttons that appear on your screen. The course of the fight animation is completely dependent on the number of correct buttons that you press. If you go on the attack and win, the other pieces disappears. If you lose, both pieces remain standing.The Slasher fighting style is without a doubt one of the most elaborate modes. If you or your opponent hits a piece, a war breaks out on your board. For example, if a pawn hits a horse, five pawns and horses appear. All of them will now enter a battle in a hack-and-slash style. In this mode you have a lot of freedom when it comes down to how and who you want to attack. You can pick the heavier attack where you will hit several pieces at once.Every chesspiece has a healthbar, which will force you to think about a strategy. The reason why you need a strategy is quite clear, because after the battle is won and the losing pieces disappear, the winners will continue with a health bar that is narrowed.SettingGraphically there's very little to criticize in Battle vs. Chess. The game is beatiful and it's, especially in the beginning, pretty cool how the fights are animated. There are several options when it comes down to the board itself. There are levels where the skies are cheerfully green and some where everything is ablaze. Sometimes the beautiful animations and scenery takes your attention away from the game. You'll see lava flowing, rocks crumbling beneath the board, skies filled with birds and all of that is being supported by smooth and easy going instrumental music which really compliments the whole setting in itself.ConclusionAll in all, it's a magnificent game. Battle vs. Chess is probably the most comprehensive chess game you'll find anywhere. There are plenty of modes that will entertain you. Either alone or with a friend. The animations of the fighting chess pieces are keeping the whole game alive and interesting. Although I do have to admit that there's one small problem. The camera. It's far away and even when you zoom in you still can not distinguish some pieces quickly. Despite this easily ignorable problem, this is probably the best chess game you will ever play and certainly a must-have for both novice and experienced players chess players."

It is full of superb modes that give the classic game a ""twist"", and an A.I. based on the Fritz engine that will give a good challenge to new and experienced gamers alike.Technically neat, but the problem lies within the nature of 3D chess games: It's confusing at times, and the mini games pretty much alienate the original game. Chess fans, however, will find long lasting appeal and a lot of challenges to take on.Do you want to play chess with action-elements? Then Battle vs. Chess is your game."

It's local lan/wan or same pc only, with options for X-Box controller or Keyboard use.That aside, the game is great, except that the AI takes ages to move when they are losing. I mean ages. Hour per turn isn't really exciting, and being a steam game means you can't play something else in the mean time if you're running it through steam. There is no setting to play classic as a speed match that I saw.AI needs a boost, online play would be awesome.Pretty good game... but the key parts are missing for me.5/10 - 8/10 if you want to play with someone at your residence."

In this its just boring and slow. The animation for moving a king is about 8 seconds, he spins in circles on the square zzz. The campaign is weak and provides little entertainment. The game was most likely designed for console therefore making the controls a complete mess and painful to use. Definitly a regretable perchase."
,Recommended,211050,10029002,"Posted: 5 May, 2014",all,Jendar,"This is one of the few chess games where you have animated people instead of usual pieces. Well, not exactly people, these are rather Forces of Light against Demons, that sort of things. No need to tell you which side stands for black pieces, I guess. Each time a piece is taken, a brief battle is played between the figurines. (Hint: you can turn on a mode in which the result of the battle depends on how fiercely you fight, not on the rules of chess game.)It happened so, that back in 1990s one of my very first computer games wasBattle Chess. In this game, I found a new and refined version of it. Name similarity is not a coincidence, be sure.Back to business, though. There are several reasons why you might like this game, in addition to the ones I've just mentioned.- It has fine graphics. Pieces and their fights look good and bright. You can also choose the way your board and its surroundings would look like. There are several variations of it, starting deep in the hell itself and ending with heavenly castle. Classical board and pieces are available too, in case you're not a fan of animation.- It's not all about fancy exterior: there's a solid chess-playing algorithm behind it. It's called Fritz, I think, and it's a rather known award-winning chess AI with loads of matches and combinations in its memory. You'll certainly like it if you are tired of chess applications which always try to play one and the same matchgame with you. AI mastery level is adjustable.- It can serve as a training simulator. There is a bunch of chess lessons inside, as well as challenges to solve. You can either learn the basics of chess or improve your skills. (I believe it even has chess-themed minigames.)- There are several non-standard game modes. One of such is mentioned in the first paragraph. They can offer considerable change to traditional gameplay, if you seek for some new experience.- You can play with a friend on the Internet or LAN. I should mention, though, that establishing connection might sometimes be tricky. When I tried to make a match with some of my friends, we could only play after telling each other exact IP addresses of our machines.So this is it. To sum it all up - it is a nice game, and it has my support; I recommend it to your attention. With a proper discount, it's even nicer."

As of the current state it appears to be bug-free and working well.- Has a good campaign. (And an evil one too. lol)- Imaginative gameplay and variety in ways to play without departing from chess.- Has animated pieces.- Has a 'Combat' type gameplay which is fun to try out, but it is seperate, so you can still enjoy proper chess without loss to strategy from poor fighting.Cons:- The interface is a little slow despite lacking depth.- Animated pieces lack character. This game could be SO much better in that regard. A rook that teleport slams every single unit just doesn't give the fun or enjoyment of a rook that pancakes a pawn and the eats the queen.Would be nice if something similar could be done with this game. would buy copies for friends and promote it as the long sought next gen battle chess if it did...- The combat mode is a refreshing addition to the game, however it lacks depth."

Stay away.The game is essentially a chess game with fighting animations, so in my opinion the main question is, how good a chess game it really is, as the graphics are essentially only nice the first times you see them. As a chess game, I think it is a rather bad one.It is  a console port that does not support normal mouse controls, ie picking up a figure by clicking on it using  a pointer. Instead you need to move the cursor through the squares of the board. (edit: This apparently has changed and it is possible to move the cursor in a normal way).The angle and way the board is presented makes it very hard to properly see things, and this cannot be changed if you want to keep the animations.The AI is soso and the game does not give you an ELO rating to select, just some ambiguous lvl of the opponent.There are plenty of free chess games available on the internet, and I think it's hard to find a worse one than this!Clearly, don't buy!"

I liked how the black force have that demonish look & white force look like some heaven guardians.You also have variety of maps to play on.Chilling sound on the menus & overall sound effects are well done.Game Modes:This game offers you many ways to play a chess game (see below) so if you're THAT intrested in chess games (or to play against your friends in Lan) I recommend this game to you.1) Classic matches against the A.I (skirmish) & other minigames.2) Battlegrounds - A whole different vibe to each battle. I recommend trying this game mode I just didn't try it because I quitted on this game early so don't make the same stupid move as I did.3) The Campaign itself (2 campaigns actually for white & dark forces).4) Multiplayer (which has none but if you fancy you can play with your friends via Lan).Gameplay:1) Controls are basic & easy to use.2) Guides - Explains about the basics of a chess game. So if you are dumb like me who never really playing or got into chess games, this guide will help you to get used to this game.3) Gameplay itself - Now this part is tricky because personally I tried to really like this game but it got on my nerves because it is challenging (even on easy difficulty).I can't simply play a single chess game that will take around half a hour of my time.For some reason I thought it would be more easy to win a chess game.. I mean what could possibly go wrong by making moves & defeating the enemy units. But no, it's not.So after around 3 hours of game time (1 hour is me learning how to play) I decided to give up on this game.Conclusion:So as you see I'm neutral on this game. I would recommend it only to those who played chess games before and liked it, or those who willing to pay few bucks to get a computer beat-down. Otherwise, skip it.If you think about ever playing a chess game.. You can start with this but don't say I didn't warn you.Overall Score: 5/10* Skip it.** Not Recommended.*** Give It A Try.**** Recommended On Sale (Wouldn't buy it more than 5-10$)****** Recommended On Full Price."

,Recommended,211050,11345803,"Posted: 21 July, 2014",all,DarnWolf,"Love this game; it is a cool representation of chess as a 3D animated battlefield. It more than holds it own against other games such as Battle Chess and Lego Chess. It really brings chess to the mainstream, rather than just to geeks. I would really recommend this game to anyone of any age and level, because it's especially great for story-mode/campaigns and for multi-player mode (LAN, direction connection - can use a VPN - and local).The campaigns (Order/White + Chaos/Black) give you a lot of surprises, either in formations, restrictions and other twists (I have yet to finish both campaigns). It's got tutorials, skirmishes and ""battlegrounds"" (an added variation where you can literally fight pieces).You can't save, and at least on a Mac OS X you can't see hints, but that's ok because it forces you to learn and play better. The animations are fun, but sometimes I got too distracted and lost important pieces, so I changed to 2D or standard 3D pieces.As of yet, the Mac OS X version isn't quite optimised for the keyboard because I don't have a PAGE UP nor a PAGE DOWN button, and the CTRL button doesn't work - for potential purchasers, don't worry, but it would be great if we could customise the keys so we can get just that little bit extra out of the game. The only other thing I can suggest is allow players to increase or decrease the AI difficulty level in campaigns.Thanks for developing this game!PS. Please can you fix the limited activations for Steam, because I regularly change my laptop every year or two."

The duel and slasher modes are a lot of fun, and honestly what I play most.

I love animated chess over 2d chess.The sound fx are fine.The music is a bit poor and could do with some more customisation options.I picked it up for 3 pounds in a sale and really happy with it.I would recommend this, especially for getting people interested in chess.I think much more could be done with it, but its still a very solid game imho.I would love to see other chess sets and more animations.  Not tried the multiplayerthe level 9 computer ai takes way to long to make any decisions I think its bugged.i have tested up to level 6 ai ok atm.The registration for this game is a bit painful,  you have to copy the code shown at the startup of steam and register."

Es muy completo tanto para nuevos (contiene tutoriales detallados) como para gente experimentada. La IA es muy buena y te hace sudar incluso en niveles bajos. Y respecto al contenido:-2 campañas (una de orden y otra del caos-2 Modos de juegos alternativos (juegas al ajedrez pero, cada vez que quieras capturar/defender una casilla tienes que luchar en un mini juego de ack and slash o poner a prueba tus reflejos haciendo QTE)- Minijuegos del tipo ""1 movimiento para hacer Jaque"" y ""1 Movimiento para capturar una unidad desprotegida""-Minijuego para entrenar tu habilidad de hacer tenedores (bastant entretenido).- Modo Battleground (a.k.a partidas normales)  con muchas posibilidades (aparte de  poder jugar en clasico o 2 modos de juegos alternativos, tambien hay 5 o 6 modalidades parala disposicion de tus fichas, desde el clasico hasta un modo tactico donde las pones donde quieres, aleatorio y mas modos)Despues de todo esto recomiendo el juego 100% muy completo, muy rejugable y con muchas opciones para no aburrirte y para que no se te haga repetitivo. Ademas ver como las fichas se matan entre ellas en 3D no tiene precio."

Não funciona online (exceto em Lan). É um jogo de Xadrez comum...Só custa muito caro, talvez se fosse mais barato seria melhor."
,Recommended,211050,28205533,"Posted: 5 December, 2016",all,★ Danceman ★,This game is beautiful. One of the best or maybe the best chess game for none chess players or perhaps even pro chess players. It has so many game modes and it's graphics is excellent. They even now just supported Linux.
