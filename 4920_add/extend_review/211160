76561197960956046,Recommended,211160,12748449,"Posted: 2 November, 2014",all,Kaizer,"When I first saw this game, I thought it would be a lot of fun: massive battles, chopping up minions, being a big damn nordic hero. I wasn't entirely wrong, but I wasn't right either. Viking: Battle for Asgard is a 3rd person hack and slash action adventure game. You play as Skarin, a Viking warrior blessed by Freya, tasked with saving Midgard (yet it's called battle for Asgard..). It takes place on 3 different islands of various sizes. It contains zero notable RPG elements, no loot, no stats, and no detailed information at all. You buy skills (moves) before really knowing much about it, you buy upgrades but don't really know how it differs from the previous one, besides it'sbetter. It is straight forward and fairly linear. Occasionally you have multiple tasks that can be completed in any order, but they all must be completed before progressing to the next area so there really is no choice involved.There are also some strange stealth sections that just feel thrown in. Maybe they were trying to break up the hack and slash monotony, which is successful, but because it varies so much from the rest of the gameplay, you really never feel equipped correctly to do them. Those sections feel very out of place, especially when they also have a collecting bit thrown in to them (for a few achievements only) but are never explained whatsoever as to why you would be collecting the things in the first place unless you read the achievements ahead of time. Youmaystumble across one of the skulls, but would never know what the heck you had collected unless you read the achievements. Just seems poorly implemented.Aside from those skulls, there really aren't any secrets to be found. I like to thoroughly explore areas looking for hidden objects or areas, but there are none to be found. You may occassionally come across a random sack of gold or chest (which only contain gold or a quest item), but that's about it. Because of this, there doesn't feel like much of a reason to explore (even when you're on a rather linear path).Visuals:Because this is a console port from Xbox 360/PS3, its graphics are similar to that generation of game. As with a lot of ports, the game is very poorly optimized for PC. It lags pretty noticibly in large battles, it has no Field of View slider, very few graphics options, and the FPS is locked at 30. There is a guide on Steam that will help get the game looking better, but it still cannot unlock the FPS but will change the FOV. Before changing it, there were times when moving the camera made my eyes hurt but even then, turning the camera seemed to blur the screen in a nauseating manner.All that said, I enjoyed the visuals. There were times when things looked really impressive, scenery looked gorgeous, and combat felt visceral. I think the Creative Assembly did a great job crafting a believable world. It felt consistant and nothing really felt out of place. Small details like fences looked like they really tried to make it fit and appear to belong there. Area layouts made sense.One of the worst things to me were the animations. Some were just straight strange (dragon summoning looks like your character just collapses and goes ragdoll) and others were just lazy. Every time you fight a Giant, the 3 different Quick Time Events are animated exactly the same, every single time. The first time you see it, you think, wow, that's pretty cool; But after seeing the same thing 9 times, it gets boring and you're just waiting for it to end. Even the dismemberment kills start to get boring after a while as there only appears to be 5 or so different variations.I think had they actually put in effort on optimization and unlocking the FPS; This game would have been recieved much better on PC.Controls:I played it with a wireless Xbox 360 controller and it felt pretty good. I did not try it with keyboard/mouse at all so I cannot say how those were, but right when you load up the game, it specifically says it was designed for a controller. The controls are rather simple to understand and build slowly in complexity. The combat does get rather repetative as you end up using the same few moves as you progress. As mentioned above, the game  has Quick Time Events when fighting tough enemies. They're not particulary hard the first time you do them, and then shift into mind numbingly easy as you progress because the patterndoes not change. There's only one kill animation for giants, so there's only one pattern to use every time you kill one. It's repetative and lacks any excitement.As mentioned above the camera was a problem. It seemed to have a habit of working against you any chance it got, allowing for a sword to your backside. Targeting was also rather strange and likes to work against you. Targeting in Viking seems to rely on auto locking on the target nearest to you, that's fine except when you're getting attacked from multiple sides and are trying to attack a specific enemy before they stike you, only to lunge at a different enemy and get hit multiple times in the back. What makes it worse is that even though you are swinging a sword and axe, you can only seem to hit one target at a time (unless using a special attack). Sure, your swing may go through multiple enemies (especially when they're clipping inside one another) but the same will only register a hit on one, which one can be hard to determine ahead of time.All said, I still recommend the game but not at full price. If it's under $5 and you like action adventure, hack and slash, or vikings, it's worth it. It's fun enough, the achievements are quite achieveable, and has a run time of 15-20 hours. There are worse ways to spend a weekend. 6/10"

Epic battles with magic, special enemys and dragons under your command. You can upgrade your magic, buy some weapons or potions and penetrate islands to release vikings. Now disadventages. There were moments when game was slowling and it was like fighting in slow motion. I heard that many people had the same problem. Second thing, on all islands you make almost the same (for me it wasnt a big problem but i have to say it) make army, find dragon, release something. And at the end dragons animations and last boss (it was the biggest disappointment for me). Just think before buying it.MaxGregor"

It wasn't set up great, but there is a lack of Viking games in the gaming community. They do bring out the aspect of Vikings well in this game, its a hack n slash where you recruit hundreds of vikings to your army and every now and then get into huge battles where its like something out of the Lord of The Rings. You can use dragons to decimate the enemys, and  chop the Legions filthy limbs off at your leisure. Overall, it's ok, it's worth a play through."

It still holds up and is just a really fun game that takes bits from all genres and puts them into a hybrid rpg action adventure. My only one complaint is the controls are pretty wonky (due to no lock on), otherwise you cant really go wrong with Viking: Battle for Asgard. Give it a chance, you wont be dissapointed.update:After 100% the game, there are a couple things I'll add.There is a glitch on the second island that makes the game seem unplayable. You will know it when it happens... No hard reset needed though. Just pause, even during the bug, window the game and come right back into it. Very strange bug, but its more an annoyance (not game breaking) than anything. This also happened two times on the third island, still not a big deal.If you are trying to 100% the game(everything is doable in one run) there is really only four missable ones and thats Skullbagger 1,2,3 and not starting the game in hard mode. Youtube it before you wage your first war campaign.Viking is still as awesome as I remember all those years ago. Happy hunting."

Some have iffy controls, others have lame stories, and a few just have weak enemies, but even with these natural foibles, glitches and hang-ups, a videogame can transcend its limitations and be heralded as a title where the sum is greater than the parts.That isn't the case with Viking: Battle for Asgard.Set in the time when the Norse Gods ruled and people hid gold in glowing urns for some inexplicable reason, Viking, the latest from SEGA and Creative Assembly, tosses you into the massive boots of Skarin, a shirtless warrior who packs a sword and battleaxe. The game opens with Skarin mortally wounded and about to take a one-way trip to Valhalla, but Freya -- Odin's daughter -- steps in to save the Schwarzenegger-like brute as long as he pledges allegiance to her and promises to go after Hel, queen of the Underworld. Skarin agrees, gets this glowing amulet from Freya, and we're off!Now, taking on the queen of the damned isn't a one-man gig. The problem is, Hel's Legion -- an army of blue-skinned, undead bad guys -- is roaming the countryside and has imprisoned the very Vikings who would be willing to fight alongside Skarin. This means that the majority of your time in Viking is spent scouring the mountain tops and grassy plains looking for men who are usually locked in giant ribcage prisons or tethered to skull poles. Find the camps, kill the Legion, and free the men. From there, the troops usually give you some task to complete such as gathering a healing honey or eliminating a traitor, and once the odd job is complete, they join your team.See, you're freeing all of these soldiers for the massive battles that Viking revolves around. When you tap Select and bring up your map, you'll find it covered with various icons indicating enemy encampments, friendly bases and more. Of the enemy kind, you'll see some that have conditions -- free X number of troops, find the battle horn, etc. -- that must be met before you can complete the task. Usually, these are the massive battles that act as a middle and end to the level.Once you meet the battle conditions, you can select the icon on the map and jump straight into the war. Here's where all of the troops you've saved march into battle with you. If you haven't seen these skirmishes in action, they can be pretty impressive. Each one starts with a cutscene depicting a sea of your men marching toward a sea of enemies. Dragons fly overhead, Shaman are casting ominous spells in the distance, and giants wait at the ready. When the scene ends, you're thrust into the battle the imagery just set up. You and hundreds of your men move towards hundreds of enemies.Although there's no way to control what your men are doing, they're generally pretty good about following you and helping the best they can -- that is by beating the living hell out of all the blue-skinned freaks that get in their way. While your boys on the ground tend to the Legion horde, you're pretty much on your own as far as ending the battle. Each scenario has win conditions such as eliminating two of the three Shamans or taking care of a few giants. Once you've completed the tasks, your troops can move deeper into the base, you'll get a new set of objectives, and the beat goes on. In the end, you have to call your Shaman to the base's heart and have her switch it to good"

However it does get repetitive after a while, they keep recycles gameplay mechanics. To win each battle you do the exact same thing every time and the way they did the end boss is extremely lazy! so i can't recommend it"
,Recommended,211160,9591697,"Posted: 22 March, 2014",all,EternalLimner,"This game got mediocre reviews at best, but the video still caught my attention and I decided to give it a try. I was pretty pleasantly surprised.To start, this is not a deep game. There are next to no RPG elements. Think of it as a GoW type game. The animations are a little clunky and a controller is crucial. It is definitely a console port. Many people also complained about it being grindy. There are only 3 islands, and completing them really is much the same. However, I didn't mind because I enjoyed the gameplay.That being said, this was a great game to come home to and just mindlessly kill. For much of the game, you're running solo and taking on small groups of enemies with your typical combat. Explore areas and delve into caves. Free guard towers and small forts. It's all typical stuff. However, the game shines in the variety of battles.To take back control of an important area, you must clear that area of enemies. Sometimes this is easier said than done. Luckily, there is usually a prison full of captured comrades nearby. Just sneak in and free them and they help in the fight! This type of battle changes the game into a small melee.Then you have ambushes. On certain areas of the map, the bad guys have patrols running around. These things are big (20-30+ troops( so you aren't going to be attacking them solo. Get enough allies and prepare an ambush. These battles are slightly bigger than he melees but fast paced and action packed.You can also do stealth missions in an enemy occupied city. Again, you run around solo, but you're in the middle of the enemy control zone. This means anything less than perfect stealth will result in death. You sneak by most opponents but occasionally stop to assassinate a guard or five.Finally is the big daddy... the city seiges. They come in various sizes and complexities, but each of them needs you to persuade an entire army to join you. And believe me... you take an army. This part of the game almost reminds me of DotA. Enemies constantly respawn from their Shamen and you have to influence the outcome of the battle by taking on the Shamen as well as other important commanders and troops. You also bring dragons with you after you unlock them (3 in all). They fly around and pretend to fight until you give them commands. Basically you just tell them a target to kill (strategic targets or the mini bosses mentioned above). Using the dragons doesn't get too detailed, but it adds great atmosphere to the battles. These things are chaotic!All in all, it isn't going to win Game of the Year or anything, but I had a ton of fun. It was one of the few games that I played right through without getting bored."

The art and music are fairly good, graphics are surprisingly still passable, if a bit bright. Buy this game only if it's on sale, and only if you like lot's of hack n' slash fighting mixed with the occasional battle set piece. QTEs are sins I don't often forgive, and niether is being a lazy port, but, this game is alright with me, regardless. If you've played Brutal Legend, and enjoyed it, but wanted a more serious attempt at a similar style game, you'll probably like this. Probably."
,Not Recommended,211160,14511012,"Posted: 16 February, 2015",all,Drakevarg,"Viking: Battle for Asgard is, at first glance, an inoffensively mediocre hack and slasher that's a bit like God of War if it was set in Magic Scandinavia and featured a mute meat freezer disguised as a man instead of a screaming psychotic ballerina dancer. And for the most part, it's exactly that. Slower, heavier combat, magic limited to spicing up your sword blows, and all the platforming and puzzles replaced with incredibly basic stealth mechanics.The game is so utterly devoid of original thought that it's hard to give it a proper review. While this isn't in and of itself worthy of a negative recommendation, this incredibly formulaic game falls apart on the eve of the giant battles that end each level. Before you can summon your ever growing army and your small collection of dragons and just drop them on the enemy's head, you always are made to sneak through your enemy's base to accomplish one task or the other, while snatching up the stores of gold they have scattered 'round.Its these parts where the game screeches to a halt, because the method of enforcing stealth basically consists of placing ten times the normal density of enemies in an area and telling you to sneak around assassinating exactly the right ones, because if even one of them spots you, you have about six seconds before every enemy within a hundred feet dogpiles you, and unlike say Assassin's Creed, the enemies here have zero concept of Mook Chivalry, and will happily stunlock you to death, dumping you back at your base to start the entire process over from scratch.I've personally made it a little over halfway through the game, but after repeating the exact same scenario about three dozen times, the game's sluggish combat loses its charm and I can't say I care how the game ends anymore. Probably predictably, given the flow of every other aspect of the story."

It feels like a watered down version of Dragon Age: Inquisition but with a weak story and less immersion. However, I found this game to be rather enjoyable once I got the hang of the combat ( Which isn't really explained too well) and spent a few hours slaughtering foes for fun. Another issue was the accessibility of the option menus which required you to reboot the game every time you wanted to tweak a performance setting so I spent the first 30 minutes trying to get the performance to balance with what my PC can run, as there is no auto setting.While the gameplay is a bit blunt and combat eventually repetitive, it does remain a pretty consistent challenge which allows a feeling of accomplishment upon completing each segment. If on special, worth giving it a shot for sure."

Plus, this game does what more should, focus on having a simple goal and then have a world that allows the player to choose what and when they do things. It feels organic, and less restrictive than most modern games. Developers need to lean gamers do not like they're hands being held all the time. Plus, how can you not love the massive siege sections? HOW?! Now, the game is definitely not perfect. First off, I'd recommend straight away playing with a controller. They keyboard just doesn't suit it. Secondly, the boss fights are awful. Including the last boss AND as much as I said developers should focus on simple stories/goals I think the games plot could of done with a bit more exposition."

There are so many open-world games today that may overshadow it.  Still, Viking is a solid game that sticks to it's formula and executes it very well.  Like I said, it is simple but it is good.The fighting is a minimalistic Light and heavy attacks and jumps. Several modifiers, however, such as pressing a shoulder button to change the attacks into trowables or into majic spells or double tapping buttons make it much more fun and satisfying.Unlike, say: a God Of War, this game is much slower and less flashy but in a good way.  You really get to see and almost ''feel'' the rib-crushing strikes done onto your opponents without all kinds of sprites blocking the view.  The game also shares God of War's Quick Time Event button pressing to a much more annoying and unnessessary extent.Overall, the game is a must buy whenever it is on a steam sale and I reccomend the gamepad when playing it."
,Recommended,211160,4319659,"Posted: 24 September, 2013",all,Ult,"My first Creative Assembly product was Spartan: Total Warrior back on the PlayStation 2. Despite all the mediocre press attention, I personally believe it was a remarkable title and an extremely good contender against well established franchises such as God of War or even games of similar scale such as Dynasty Warriors.Viking on the other hand doesn't quite live up to the same standards, but isn't all that bad once you get into grips with how the gameplay works and familiarise yourself with the core mechanics. Your main objective is to pretty much assembe an army big enough to reclaim the lands. More or less Lord of the Rings, but with vikings. You need to complete favours for individual clans/groups in order to gain their trust and expertise. All in all there's three islands to conquer with the first island serving more as a tutorial and introduction to how everything works. At the beginning controls may feel a bit tedious but that's something you'll get used to by the time you complete the first island. Although I felt the main protagonist was uninspiring and quite simply dull, he manages to pull his own in combat once you acquire special attacks from spirits of Valhalla at arenas; and magical skills from the Blacksmith which promote magical skills - fire, ice and lightning. Major boss encounters are also on the underwhelming side as they fail to display any real challenge, although the battle leading up to the final encounter is far more challenging . There's a lot of running around between objectives which may become a drag at later stages where the landscape is remarkably bigger. Overall I was personally satisfied with the product to some extent, but wish it were similar to that of Spartan where the player could somewhat relate to a speaking protagonist in a brutal and relentless title."

Wandering around to find a hidden heap of gold behind a barn when there is little to buy is not that interesting.

After reaching mid-game, I had  hoped to find out how to skip the largely boring slo-mo executions.There's Quick Time Events, oh joy!The mass combat looks interesting at first but is garbage - basically the player is forced to ignore it as good he can.etc etc.If you're into vikings and the thought of slaughtering hundreds of undead baddies makes your inner berserk grin red, check it out.All others, pass.Only 2,5 blooddrenched axes out of 5 hit a gut-smeared bullseye - Passable for fans."

And seeing this game was published by Sega I expected a lot of bugs, but didn't really experience any. Exept for one. Going to the dragon's eye view the screen can go ""tilt"". Going to desktop and back into the game through alt-tab fixed it every time.Other then that this game was enjoyable even though it has many rough edges. You start in a small settlement and have to build up an army. The game was pretty lineair and walked you straight from point A to B in a logical and cleanly designed fashion. This makes the experience quite relaxing, but also predictable and repetitive. You go around freeing settlements and tied up vikings in order to increase your army. The culmination at the end of completing each map makes it all worth while however.As a reward for the grind you can see it was all worth something. The battles feel big and need some patience. You can see catapuls and summoned dragons in action. When you take over the city it is your turn to occupy and use it as the next forward base of operations. This too will show that your army and support from people is growing as your progress.Still the battles themselves are not challenging in the least and functions very roughly. Having to gather rage in order to perform combo's takes away the flow of battle at times. While in the combo you can't stop it and use a block/evasive action resulting in the occasion stunlock by opponents.It is a rough. mediocre game with some interesting ideas. People looking for a challenge won't find it here. The story is fairly standard. Still worth a try for a casual entertaining walktrhough. If you take your time this game is finished entirely in about 15hours of play."

I played on hard and the first difficult fight took me a few times to overcome, but once I got a hang of the combat dynamics it was definitely worth playing on a higher difficulty.

Sure, it's a fun hack and slash game based off of Viking mythology (although I don't think Hel ever tried to invade Midgard) with fun ways to kill your enemies, but it gets... Old. And the frame rate and character design isn't the greatest in the world (minus some of the monsters you kill. Kinda remind me of the draugar (that's plural for draugr, by the way) from Skyrim). The controls are hard to get used to (hell, this is a console game). From what I've heard and seen, there are some RTS strategies and you get to fight dragons, giants, and a whole bunch of other baddies, so there are some redeeming factors.However, that's not enought to save this game from being a ""game-to-pass-the-time-with"" thing. So, if you're looking for a game with a gripping story with a bunch of drama, I wouldn't recommend this (or Skyrim. Skyrim has the gripping story but no drama thankfully). But, if you're looking for a fun way to pass the time while getting rid of your bloodlust, I'd say give it a shot. It's not the greatest, but it's entertaining when taken in small amounts."

However those are really the only massive down-fall the game has, the combat is tough and skillfull, not unfair mind you. The animations of characters; specifically Skarin; the protagonist moves and plays beautifully, even the platforming parts of the game are well-done and a joy to play as it's all animated greatly and implimented skillfully. But to be honest, the best part of Viking is the all-out wars that are featured within the game, and there's alot! And surprisingly, the game doesn't tank then, where at least at some points 1000's of characters are shown on screen. This game is great ofr those looking for a hack and slash experience and don't want a story bugging you along the way and this is one of the only games that I can name that let you wage war and personally let you get involved in them.

However, w/o youtube I would have rage quit long time ago.  There are at least 3 missions that left too much to the imagination and you need to use stealth.  There was no guidance on where to go and what to do and there is no guidance when stealth is warranted.   The game is broken down to three islands.The middle island was too long and the last island was lots of fun but too short.  The graphics were good, the ocean, smoke, fog  and heat effects were particularly great  The story line didn't particularly end in any meaningful or satisfactorily way.  Some action keys are not accurately described.   For example combo moves.  I smashed to key board enough but still couldm't master all the attackes and dodges in the game.  Sometimes the 'x' key is described but it is the LMB.I had the hardest time in dropping while hanging from a ledge.  In the last mission I found out it is the 'R' key, otherwise I just smashed bunch key until I dropped.  Looking at the key bindings doesn't help.The game was much fun given the price.  The graphics ranged from good to great but the camera positioning was cumbersome and choppy during fights.   Aiming on which one opponent of many to strike was cumbersome or in-effective.  The keyboard is buffered too much so queued character actions could led to death or much damage.Hope this is helpful."

With a check point system there's infinite respawn making it a very casual game but also tedious as everything is reset until an area is completed in one run through. There are aspects of rpg... collect cash to unlock new moves, increase special powers and health but its all very superficial and lite and actually gives the game a reverse difficulty curve as no new enemy are introduced after the second island. There is also an inventory of sorts - 3 consumables, 3 powers and a repeatable passive buff.The game isn't really open world but more 3 large islands with progression related restrictions in place making each island effectively 2 parts. Quests/missions are either kill everything here (primary), kill everything and bring back item(secondary), stealth for item/assination.(once per island).The Grand battles break up the flow and usually consist of several stages each with a set goal - kill 1 shamen, kill 2 shamen kill 3 shamen... etc... this can either be done directly or by killing optional targets to charge up the dragons and then watching them via cutscene fullfil the primary objectives.Although for the most part an enjoyable game if somewhat repetative this suffers from being a console port and having some particularly annoying features all of which are showcased to a high degree in the final mission/bossfight.Tight POV with overly large player character dominating the screen.Nasty camera with impeded vision from environment/sfx. The camera also has an auto-return function making it difficult to handle while getting smacked around or travelling uphill.semi-auto target lock - can get real annoying at times when the combo switches target mid sequence or doesn't lock.Gamepad orientated controls with repeat tap action for environment interaction and bossess.30fps cap - any framerate dips lead to sluggish controls (Reported - Nvidia issues).halfscreen draw distance for grass etc very noticable in snow environments.No real graphics customisation beyond low/medium/high defaults... although the game directory can be directly editted.Does what is does farily well - could have been so much better."

Second, it gets rather repetitive after an hour or so because it's all basically the same: go save bunch of viking friends of yours and kill everything on the way. Third, the plot is just horrible. Well, to be honest there isn't any plot, besides the: ""Save Asgård!"". Fourth, the protagonist Skarin is one boring viking. Huge, muscular, blessed by a god herself so you'd think he is an exciting one? Again sadly not. He doesn't make any sound, voice, or noice at all (besides couple of screams) and just marches forward killing 'em all.If you want an aimless hack 'n slash where you just go in and kill everything on your way - this one's for you.

I think that the mass battles and special buffs the hero can give his soldiers are an interesting touch, but don't do enough to make the game stand apart from its AAA predecessors.The environments are well made and pleasant, but lack the grandness that I feel a Viking Epic deserves; and frankly what I've come to expect from these kinds of games after GoW and DS.At the end of the day, its plenty fun and challenging enough to warrant the price, especially if you catch it on sale."

My only grievance (which I might still figure out) is that I cannot find any place to go back and change the controls. You can play Vikings: Battle for Asgard via keyboard or consol, but it was originally made for consol. Some of the keyboard buttons chosen to stand in for the controler buttons are a bit wonky, which you don't find out until you're playing the game. I would like to go back and change them, but so far I've had no luck. Which means I don't get to use fancy skills...but! Even without said fancy skills, this game is still awesome.

RPG elements are in the game as well, though could've been better and more varied in skills/moves. There's 3 open-world maps to fight on where you undertake missions to gather your army, which culminates into some epic battles. The story (from what I recall) is kind of a typical ""Chosen One hero fends off the evil and unites all the people to fight the evil!"" with Vikings//Norse mythology. That's not to knock it too harshly in that aspect, as it would be an interesting read if it was fleshed out in a book. The game itself doesn't feel incredibly deep, you can blaze through it pretty quickly. However, if you're a completionist it'll take a bit longer, but not much. Once the campaign is over, that's pretty much it.Considering the age of the game, it was alright for it's time and still stands at an alright level. To me, this game had a lot of potential that it didn't quite live up to. Never did capture the magic that Spartan: Total Warrior had back on the PS2/Xbox. Grab it on a sale, and have a 360 controller on hand since the KB&M controls are relatively terrible in my opinion. If you still have a copy of Spartan: Total Warrior or have that game in some way, I'd play that instead and grab this when it's $1."

As to be expected it's do this quest and you get one step closer to getting this power.It's not a bad game, I think I got it for a couple of dollars and it killed a few hours, but I lost interest in the game quickly between the game play and the story. If you have something else to play you are going to explore the game and prolly get bored."

I'm going to be honest with you the port could be a lot better. It's capped at 30FPS, there is a lot of stuttering and dropping belove 30, especially large battles which are cool lag a lot. You also need a controller to play this game adequatly. Behind all those negatives there is a wonderful large scale hack and slash game that looks pretty good even today."

You have a diety come to you and tell you you must save the lands. It has dragons. It has fighting. It has a farily large world.What it also has is mash F to open a chest.Mash F to open the cage to save the vikingsMash F to do this.It also has kill moves for everything. Hit E to kill, or let them die anyway at that point.The AI is easy to fool, you can get through the game only attacking once, shileding, repeat. I took out the Eliete traveling hoarde with that in about 5 min.It is a very quest driven game which is not bad, but you have to update teh quests on your map yourself.Overall a game trying to be skyrim and feels more like a very bad Xbox port.Easily a 3/10"

You literally do the same things on three different island i.e. collecting Kegs for an Inn-Keeper. Furthermore the level design dull and you had to run way too long trough a lifeless environment. Above that the story was cheese and I couldn't really feel it. The game seemed a little like a boring brother of god of war.

I got it with a bundle of total war games, and after the 7-10 hours it takes to beat it, I can say that it was a good way to waste time. Get it on sale, not worth more than 5$. And if you play the game, try to level up at the arena ASAP, because the game suffers from the fact that you don't have enough moves at the beginning for the combat to  feel slick and fun."
