,Recommended,211180,17570108,"Posted: 16 August, 2015",all,Tom,"Unmechanical is a puzzle based game, released in August 2012. The game was also later ported to the iOS due to it's popularity on the PC platform.I am normally not a massive fan of puzzle type games like this as I just find my self aimlessly trying to figure out what to do for hours on end. Thankfully Unmechanical offers puzzles whilst challenging, but also offer a logical resolution to them unlike other games in this genre. You can often work out what you need to do on each puzzle within a few minutes of analyzing the surrounding scene. The puzzles can range from light reflecting puzzles, to memory puzzles. In fact, I have to say, I can't remember (ironic) the last game I played which had memory puzzles in, this game actually made me write notes down on a piece of paper in order for me to progress which again, is something which is commonly not needed in this day and age.The graphics and art style in Unmechanical are lovely. It has that mechanical look to it, with some really nice looking textures in the environment, and the animation of everything is just so smooth and faultless.Unmechanical also offers various endings to the game; which is something I only found out after I had finished the game. Thankfully you can easily access the other endings of the game due to the last save point being just before you make the choice so, allowing you to see them all if you so please.I wouldn't say Unmechanical is a difficult game as such, you can work out all of the puzzles if you think about it for a few moments, none of them have crazy resolutions that make no sense, and a couple of them are only skill based too.A playthrough from beginning to end of Unmechanical took me about five hours which is exactly the sort of length I look for in this type of game. I think anymore and it would start to feel drawn out more than it should. However there is no replay ability to it, as I said, you can easily access the other endings, and once you have done all the puzzles once, there is no need to play it again. Thankfully though, the prices reflects this, sitting nicely at £6,99 - which is just the right cost for a game of this length.I didn't have any technical issues whilst playing. Whilst the graphics look really nice, this game will be able to be played on pretty much any setup.I'll certainly recommend Unmechanical, if you aren't normally a fan of puzzle based games I would still recommend it, because I'm not normally a fan, but I had a really good time whilst playing. Hardcore puzzle fanatics may well find the puzzles to be a little too easy, but it's still worth the couple of hours of your time to experience this awesome game.Tom's Score Card1) Stay away2) Only recommended when on sale3) Recommended4) Highly recommended5) This is a must playIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

Achievements can be near impossible to get and some can't be gone back to once passed. Overall, a lovely game with just enough of a storyline to keep you hooked and make the choice at the end a tough one. I recommend using a gamepad, it makes all of the difference on puzzles requiring precision."

It's short, about 2,5 hours long, but that's not a dealbreaker. I do wish it was a bit longer though, because the world it is set in is just wonderfully crafted and the puzzles are logical. You won't ever die in this game and the puzzles can be solved without (too much) trial-and-error which makes the whole experience so much better.That and the game actually has 2 endings. Which I both love (though I prefer the ending with the scene after the credits). The backstory is done in such a way that it can be interpreted in your own way. Love it !So, this comes highly recommended ![Rating: 77/100]"
,Recommended,211180,17531919,"Posted: 14 August, 2015",all,Biodegradable,"Unmechanical is a charming and endearing little puzzle/exploration game that started off as a student project before a development team caught eye of the group of students and teamed up to make a full-fledged game. It's built on the Unreal engine, once again proving to still be one of the most superior as the graphics are top-notch and the mechanics are simple and fluid. Not jutters, not frame-rate issues,  just smoooooooooooooooooooooooooooth.You play as an adorable little flying robot, who I nicknamed ""Ohm"" (based on the small noise it makes when it bumps into things), and one day as you're flying about with your family, an odd-looking pipe sprouts out of the ground and sucks you in. After a very long ride down a very long pipe, you wake up in a very strange underground bio-mechanical nexus, and you need to find your way out and reunite with your loved ones. As you venture forth, solving puzzles to pass through obstacles, you will find this place to have a dark and sinister secret.Unmechanical encourages exploration and outside-the-box thinking as it challenges you with a combination of traditional and environmental puzzles that test your memory and reflexes. Anyone who has ever played games such as Portal, Machinarium or Limbo will feel right at home with this one. It's not very long, though that can depend on your puzzle-solving skills. The game is solely based on its puzzles, so there aren't any enemies to stop you. Much like Portal, you either solve it, or be trapped.If you're like me and like a challenge with environmental puzzles like those in Oddworld, Limbo or Portal, you'll love it. If you're more of a traditional puzzler who often plays Sudoku and puzzles those of the likes of Machinarium, there's plenty for you as well. If you consider yourself an expert puzzler who utterly destroys puzzle games though, Unmechanical will probably be pretty easy and you'll breeze through it in an hour. It really depends.I suppose the only fair criticism that can be thrown at this game is its lack of narrative. The description I gave at the beginning is really just my own interpretation. It's rather ambiguous and interestingly enough, the game has two endings depending on this one action you may or may not decide to do near the very end of the game. Otherwise, you can simply consider it a story about escape. It's kind of like Limbo but you have a clearer idea of what your ultimate goal actually is.If you're into any of the games I mentioned above, I recommend this one. Especially to fans of Limbo who enjoy a forboding atmosphere and visuals that'll make them drool with delight."

,Recommended,211180,24172232,"Posted: 7 July, 2016",all,genoforprez,"Very short game. I beat it in about 2 hours. So length is a factor you'll probably want to consider. That being said, it's a great puzzle game and the length is just about right. With a game like this, I could maybe see it becoming tedious if it dragged on for 20 hours. Sometimes it's better when a game knows just how long is long enough, and I think Unmechanical  knows perfectly well.There is no combat or action in the game to speak of. It is 100% a puzzle game. The gameplay reminds me a little bit of Insanely Twisted Shadow Planet, but minus the combat, much more emphasis on puzzles, and MUCH more atmospheric. The lighting is excellent and there are some complex and gorgeous backgrounds as well.The only controls you have in the game are directional movement and the ability to lift / carry light objects using a tiny magnet beam. You wouldn't think much interesting variety would come out of just that, but the puzzles actually stay pretty fresh and interesting all the way through.I'll admit there were one or two puzzles that I managed to solve, but I'm not entirely sure what the logic of the puzzle was or why the thing I did worked, but you are probably smarter than me. ;-)It is a very short game, which may give you pause at the $10 price tag, but if the game is on sale or if you want atmospheric puzzlers badly enough, you really can't go wrong with Unmechanical.On the scale below, despite whatever doubts I might have about the price-to-length ratio, I'm gonna say that Unmechanical just barely scrapes its way into a 6 for me.7) A classic, essential, and/or must-buy game that is worth full price.6) A good game that is worth the full price.5) A pretty good game worth checking out--especially if discounted.4) A fairly good game, but I'd recommend buying it discounted.3) Not great, but a few redeeming qualities. Only buy if heavily discounted.2) Only worth checking out if you are dangerously curious.1) Avoid at all costs."

At times the puzzles can be very challenging but are in no way unsolvable. Also, there is a clue system build in so they will never get in your way. The world around them is beautifully crafted and fits in the style and story. The achievements are a joy to get and actually contribute to the game in a fun way because they encourage you to experiment with the puzzles and physics. As a indie game this is really impressive. What you get here is a complete product that must have been made with a lot of patience and love and for that the makers deserve all credit. For those interested in the play time, you should be able to get at least 4 hours out of this title. Make no mistake though, those are 4 perfectly enjoyable hours for a good price! Also, I would recommend playing with a (Xbox) controller for more precision, but a keyboard should work just fine.I can't wait for more from these makers. Maybe a prequel, sequel or a new game entirely!"

Reason why I played it more than once and on separate systems is to get all the achievements/trophies. If you're an achievement/trophy hunter this game, setting aside on how awesome of a story that it tells, has very achievable achievements. I did not finish the game on Steam though and that's probably because playing it on the ps3, ps4 and xbone got me burnt out on it.Other than that the game is wonderful to play. Just a little similar romance-ish story, like Machinarium, of a lost robot that needs help finding his way to his significant other, saving her and escaping together. It's also a pretty fun puzzle solving game. The puzzle solving isn't all that hard I will spoil that. Well actually it depends on how fast you can pick up what's going and how certain parts work really. I'd suggest it. It's definitely worth the play."

The graphics are nice and you will want to stay in one spot just to look at the backgrounds. It's also fun to just poke around and play with the puzzles, some of which will almost solve themselves which is a rare find (but nice for the kids).Beware though - programming errors may stand in your way. On two occasions some needed objects logded themselves in a way where I couldn't move them. Had to quit to main menu, load up the game again and thankfully was kicked back to last checkpoint, making me able to complete the puzzles. Another time the game simply switched off. As I reloaded the game, it put me in a place where I was stuck beneath an elevator that couldn't be moved. I quit and reloaded and this time the game put me back a ways, making me able to progress past the elevator as needed.I played this with my daughter age 6, and as much as we really liked the graphics and the puzzles - only one time needing to consult online help - the ending was a huge disappointment to us.  The ending feels like the devs ran out of money or some deadline just came way too close. Either way, it was a complete letdown. If you have an intro, have an outro as well guys."
76561198040466770,Recommended,211180,12689795,"Posted: 29 October, 2014",all,abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz,"The following is from:http://ricepixel.blogspot.jp/2014/10/unmechanical-is-not-word.htmlUnmechanical is not a wordBut environmental is.  And this is exactly what the game designers for Unmechanical did unbelievably right with how they designed their puzzles.  I have been developing this theory about puzzles in games as having a line dividing them: on the one side are inductive puzzles (puzzles that implicitly communicate their parameters to the player via the environment and leave the player to discover the solution) and deductive puzzles (puzzles that explicitly communicate to the player the rules that govern the parameters of the puzzle and leave the player to deduce the solution).  Now why did I use the word discover with inductive puzzles yet deduce with deductive puzzles?  Could I have used induce instead of discover?  Yes I could have.  Should have I?  No.  Why?  Because discover is much more engaging of a word.  That is exactly the attitude you need when attempting to solve inductive puzzles.  You need to engage every....... single...... goddamn...... object......... because sometimes you never know which one will lead to the solution.  Now I must admit that this strategy is used predominately in adventure games with what I call pixel treasure hunt.  But Unmechanical did an ""amazing"" job at implicitly communicating the expectations of its puzzles using solely elements from the game.  (If it weren't for this puzzle I would be able to take that amazing out of the parenthesis but leaving the player to figure out how to solve a puzzle can have some backdraft if not properly designed into the environment, as I will now address.)The only issue I have seen with the inductive form of puzzle design is that heavy reliance on the environment to communicate the parameters of a puzzle means the designers have to heavily rely on solid environmental design.  It is very easy to make mistakes here simply because humans are not accustomed to this form of communication.  Imagine this: You need to tell your GF that you are going to be late from work.  You can either call her and tell her directly (deductive) or devise a way for her to figure it out as she interacts with her environment (inductive).  The latter is MUCH MUCH MUCH more enjoyable from a game design point of view...IF DONE CORRECTLY!!!!!  However, nothing is more frustrating than knowing the game wants you to do something before progression in the story in allowed yet having no clue what to do.In the end though, I applaud the design team behind Unmechanical for taking the inductive route of puzzle design simply because I don't see it often.  Don't get me wrong, both forms of puzzles are wonderfully fun in their own right but too many developers take the easy route of writing a story for a game, then jerking the gamer out of that story every time a puzzle is introduced to explain the rules behind it.  The rule of thumb I would have towards whether a game should have inductive vs deductive puzzles would be - respect the gamer's expectations.  If you have inductive puzzles put every single drop of design juice into the environment to ensure that the gamer is communicated clearly what is expected of him to solve the puzzle without ever being jerked from the story.  If you have deductive puzzles then take advantage of them by making puzzles with interesting rules that require back door logic, or crossword thinking to solve.  DO NOT make a game that doesn't know what it is because the gamer will immediately know it and hate you forever for it.Here is my Playalyzation of this game:https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYBJxdpXNnt6LMk0EpgQ2gitOjWTd-jXm"

And even though such a comparison falls short, I enjoyed it as much as the latter. But what is it all about? Unmechanical is a physics-puzzle game, which means your missions are mostly related to lifting some stones here, dropping some stones there. Good news is that the puzzles are really well-crafted, diverse and entertaining. The game's level design is terrific, and the gameplay is praiseworthy: both keybord and joystick work fine. Perhaps the storyline was the only thing that needed some improvement: we don't know who we are or why we are where we are; and the ending was also a letdown because it came too abruptly.

It is not a long game and can probably be finished in a couple of hours - there's no chance for getting stuck and doing something wrong that can't be reversed. Most of the time it is pretty obvious where next to go and what to do - a few of the puzzles and routes are pretty confusing, though.Cons are that the environments in game are similar enough that it can be hard to remember where to go (though it must be said that they are pretty and very atmospheric) - especially when you take a break from the game, which can feel a little 'same-same' in a longer sitting. There were some parts where timing was crucial, which was a little annoying as the controls feel quite heavy and dense making fine maneuvering quite difficult - fortunately they were few and not too frustrating so it ended up only taking a few tries for each.All in all, it's a nice little game for taking a break and worth a few Euro, though I would definitely wait for a sale to pick this title up."

Super short (finished it end to end in 2h play time).2. Since there is no map to traverse levels, it can get very confusing (and annoying) figuring out where to go next. More than once I had to find a trap door which should have been immediately obvious but was not, time was wasted looking for it.3. Slightly buggy as you can get stuck particularly when carrying objects but meh, nothing a quick reload can't fix without losing pretty much anything.4. Felt most of the puzzles were too easy. Many puzzles are impossible to solve until you come back later but nothing tells you that is the case which is frustrating.2.5/5 Get it only if its on a large discount and you want a quick brain teaser."

Charming visuals and simple, good controls make this a solid and enjoyable game.As a puzzler, the most important part of the game is, well, the puzzles, and Unmechanical does it well with a variety of different kinds, including pattern recognition, memory, physics-based, and a few arcade-y bits. The difficulty is on the easy side, but not annoyingly so--I would make steady progress until I would get stuck, exit, and the next time I played I would generally solve it right away.  There are no in-game instructions, but they aren't needed; just go and explore, observe your surroundings, and you'll figure out what to do.  (There is an in-game hint system, but I never used it so I can't comment on its helpfulness).  It took me just under 4 hours to finish, but would be quicker for some folks.But why rush through the world? Unmechanical has a cool visuals, including rundown industrial areas mixed with oddly organic environments, not to mention the previously noted adorable main character. The simple controls also let you relax and enjoy the atmosphere: use arrows to fly, and hold down one button to use your tractor beam. I found the controls worked very well, and when picking up objects they felt appropriately ""weighty"".My only complaints are that controllers are not fully supported--they can be used in-game, but the menus require a mouse--not a big deal, but a little annoying as I usually use a tablet and so my mouse isn't always handy. I would also have liked to see more of the underground robots to make the world a bit more alive, but that's just my own personal preference.Overall, I recommend this game if you're not looking for a big challenge, but rather a nice world to explore while putting on your thinking cap :)"

Worth every cent despite the criticisms I'm about to level.  Firstly, the game has a very annoying tendancy to make you complete the same puzzle several times before allowing you to continue (eg. making you carry five rocks to a button when one or two will do). This tends to undermine the puzzle aspect and replace it with useless tedium at times. Secondly, it is far to easy to make a mistake and lodge a physics object in a place where it is impossible to recover it. In Portal, for example, you had to put in some serious effort to actually lose a cube because, in most cases, the dispenser would simply provide a replacement; this is not the case in Unmechanical. This issue is compounded by the fact that there is no manual save system, and no way to restart a level from a particular point. It is therefore, very easy to create a situation in which you will be forced to start again from the begining because a rock has landed itself in fron of a door or gotten stuck underwater.Despite these issues, do yourself a favor and buy this game. It is worth the $10 for the visuals alone."
