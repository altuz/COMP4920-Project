Your travels will take you through 7 different levels and can be played on 4 different difficulties. It can also be played with up to 4 friends which makes it even better. After you go through the campaign mode you can't keep racking up your score by playing the arena matches they have.Now I know this game got horrible reviews and the metacritic rating sits at 39 but you know after playing it for a good 10hrs, I've come to believe the critics don't know crap. Yes the game has some flaws but I didn't find anything that made this game unplayable. It's action packed, has many weapons to buy and upgrade, 4 levels of difficulty, and is just fun as hell to play with friends.There are about 9 different enemies types in the game. They range between regular enemies, mini bosses, and big bosses. Further in the game you will get a mixture of them all at any time. Design and graphics are subpar and don't really seemed polished but this doesn't break you away from the gameplay. I used a controller playing it as it was a little easier for me but you can use mouse and keyboard. Every once and a while when I hit reload it would make the sound but wouldn't actually do it. This really didn't bother me to much when playing.There isn't a story to follow so if that's what you're looking for you won't find it here. It has a few glitches I've seen like characters weapons floating behind or next to them, It froze up on me once and I had to restart my PC because it wouldn't close. It also dropped to like 1 fps on me at the end of one level which I just restarted at the checkpoint and it never did it again. These minor issues never made me want to stop playing and never ruined the fun for me.If you own this game or have been thinking about getting it don't believe the metacritic avg. score and play it. It has it's flaws but overall a great game for you and some friends to burn some time on.Bear rating 7.5/10"

Primal Fears is apparently from the same people, but lo and behold, this one is actually playable!I'm not yet sure just how much LONG-TERM playability it's going to have for me - I suspect it'll get repetitious in no time - but thus far it's simple, dumb fun, and even a teeny tiny bit atmospheric to boot. Far from the best game I've ever played, but far from the worst.Heck, so far I'm enjoying it way more than Killing Floor, which is just mindless shooting followed by mindless purchasing followed by more mindless shooting. Sure this one is much the same deal, but at least it has enough pretence to attempt the semblance of a plot, however slight it may be. And that's all I ask for in a game: the slightest semblance of a plot. And a bucket-load or two of hefty violence never hurts, either.1.4 hours up on the clock already, I reckon I'll manage at least 5 or 10 before this game runs its course for me. Definitely worth the $2.49, though they're surely taking the♥♥♥♥♥♥with the normal price tag of $9.99. Get it on sale! Kill giant insectoid things rather than the usual boring zombies!! Keep your expectations low, and you may actually have a passably good time!!!Verdict: 6.5/10."
,Not Recommended,211280,13678547,"Posted: 28 December, 2014",all,OH PREAZE,"Primal Fears looks like an alright game in the screenshots but when playing it you realise you made a terrible mistake in buying this. Especially if you brought a 4 pack and gave the 3 copies to friends who were in game with you to witness the horrors.The game itself is a great idea but the execution of its creation went horribly wrong. You start out with an assault rifle with loads of ammo! (20/700) then as you encounter the weakest enemies in the game you realise it takes 1-2 magazines to kill them and that is with others shooting it. You also get a shotgun! which I found out later in the game because it is automaticly set the key to change weapon as T and even then the shotgun is stupidly weak like the assault rifle.The chat in game is easy to find and use but the colour the text is displayed is horrible for this game, if 99% of the game was bright yellow it would fit in but when it's all dark and you have light grey text you can barely read it. Also the amount of time the text stays on the screen is horrible, you send a message to your friends and it is gone in 1.5-2 seconds (Literally!)The game has no real story or a plot line to lose yourself in. The closest thing you get to a story is by finding paper on the floor to read and when you read it you don't feel like you're having fun learning the story you feel depressed (Out of the 3 of us I was the most depressed since I brought the 4 pack and asked my friends to play, If my friends are reading this, guys/gals i'm sorry I asked you to join me in playing this game)The game has no minimap or little arrow at the top of your screen pointing to the place you need to be (Like other games like this do) making it really easy to get lost and walk around in circles allowing more of the mutant things to spawn which take ages to be killed.When joining a friends game when they start the game you are stuck in a little area with red circles and only one of them let everyone use it and that was the shop, the rest of the red circles did nothing (Even for the host) it took us 5 minutes to start the first mission and when we started it none of us knew how any of us did it.I recommend not getting this game since the development of it was horrible. Add me if you have anymore questions about the game itself or anything else."

I could see a bit more if you buy it with friends.Very good game with a odd story, its similar to How to Survive with a bit of dead space? For 4 bucks I would totally say get this game, although I am unsure just how much replayability there is, if any.The story is hectic and would make no sense, its good writing but what government lets a third party spray ""Gas"" all over the city, without testing it on humans? Not the worst thing in the world but deffinately not something to scoff at either, do your writing better!I really like the controls and was surprised at how fluid they were, and how you had to be facing a direction to move faster, otherwise you walk. Makes for nice ""Back up to wall and shoot everything epicly"" scenes. Using the E and Q buttons you can change the direction of the camera, and while the camera is very high up and sometimes very restricting, it was well done and made me feel like any time I tapped E or Q by accident that it was a whole new experience, which it wasent but feels that way.The monsters got annoying a big part of the issue for the game for me. Half the guns are useless, as the only ones I used were the M4 and the Launcher, an entire clip kills two basic guys... normal difficulty. It was crazy because if 6 guys came up to you, then you spent 5 minutes trying to run back and shoot then run and shoot. Not much strategy.Also you knew every trap, almost every secret is hidden by a onslaught of enemies waiting for you to pass the invisible line. It was annoying because it was expected everytime.Id say 7/10 for the type of game its meant to be, and the price of 4 dollars. Any cheaper and id rate it .5 higher for every buck less."

76561198093253279,Recommended,211280,21803896,"Posted: 12 March, 2016",all,clocutron,"EDIT 1: See below for updated reviewEDIT 2: See below that for final reviewSEE END FOR TL;DROriginal Review:There's a lot here that could make this a great game but, sadly, it just doesn't fulfill its potential.  The environments look cool but the level design is poor.  The variety of weapons seems great but the ones I've tried so far are severely underpowered, even with some upgrades applied, not to mention you have to buy ammo at shops throughout the levels or at base camp - there are no pickups besides health and money.I had to lower some graphics settings but gameplay seems fairly smooth with those changes.  You can rotate the camera, which is important since there is no dithering allowing you to see your character behind obstacles.  The addition of moveable objects seems cool at first until you get stuck by these items when trying to escape a fight.There's no map of any kind and no indication of where you're supposed to go or what you're supposed to do to progress.  This can be very frustrating, especially given the aforementioned poor level design.  The story is beyond basic, told through a series of newspapers you find throughout.  Important to note that reading a newspaper, as well as using the shop, doesn't pause the game and leaves you vulnerable to attack.Overall, I really want to like this game because it has a huge amount of potential but the truth is there are a ton of games that do this genre better.  At this point, I'm not sure I'll bother trying to finish the game, though I may come back to it at some point to give it another try.  Sorry DnS Development - not recommended.Update 1:So, I decided to give this game another shot and now I've played a bit over 11 hours total.  Sadly, my initial assessment stands and I still cannot give it a thumbs up.I've tried every weapon and all of them have some problem limiting their effectiveness.  Not enough ammo (e.g. Nailgun, Flamethrower, Shotgun), too long to wind up (e.g. Minigun), too slow (e.g. Shotgun), etc.  Even with most/all available upgrades, none of the weapons are particularly effective.  In the end, I keep falling back on the Assault Rifle - the first weapon you start with - which, in many situations, is simply not powerful enough.  Also of note is the totally useless melee attack which is very slow and your endurance bar only allows three swings before having to rest for it to refill.The level design is often frustrating, forcing you to (very slowly) rotate the camera to be able to see.  There are a number of places - locks, switches, etc. - where you have to hold down ""F"" and wait for a progress bar while you inevitably get attacked and have to start over.  The same endurance bar that affects melee combat also limits your ability to run to about 2-3 seconds before having to wait for it to refill.  This makes it difficult if not impossible to escape a hoard of enemies while you reload your weapon.I had really hoped I was being overly negative with my earlier review but I quickly became frustrated by all of the same issues I had before.  I just can't recmmend this game when there are so many better games in the top-down shooter genre.Update 2: Final ReviewYeah, so something made me decide to come back to this game yet again and, while there's still a great deal about this game that I think could easily have been done better, I'm cautiously changing my review to a thumbs up.  For some reason, I really felt the need to come back and finish this game, whether simple completionism or what, I'm not sure but I just don't like leaving games unfinished.  I will now say that this game is not absolutely terrible.  Yes, there are many games that do the genre better and yes, if you haven't played a lot of them, there are others you should buy first.However, some of my problems diminished as I continued through the game.  For one, the level design improves to some extent in later levels.  Also, getting used to rotating the camera as well as avoiding moveable objects makes levels easier to navigate, though it can still be frustrating to get stuck on objects when trying to flee from the center of a battle.  As for my complaints about the weapons, as I learned to more effectively use some of them and switch between various weapons, it definitely made combat easier.  I was still unable to ever effectively use melee combat and I believe that ability could just as well have been left out as made so useless.  The admittedly sparse plotline is fleshed out just enough by the scattered newspapers to drive the game to the end, just don't expect anything too engrossing.TL;DRWhile this game suffers from many issues that prevent it from filling its potential, I still found it worth playing through to the end.  There are certainly better games out there in this genre but, if you've played most of them and are looking for something different, you may find enough here to keep you interested for a short time.  It's not a long game and doesn't really have any replayability (short of higher difficulties) so pick it up for a couple bucks on sale if you can - it's simply not worth $10.  I'll give it a cautious thumbs up but read through the whole review if you'd like to know some of the issues the game has."

There is also co-op support and achievements.  The graphics are good, the action is intense and the music is exceptional (creepy when need be and 'gets you pumped' caliber when it has to be!!).

The graphics are decent but with collision bugs: the foes can pass and to attack through walls and doors. No zoom camera. The mechanics is optimized to cooperation and solo mode is frustrating: ammo recharge and the melee attack are too slow and the sprint too short. There are few types of monsters and ever make ambushes in the same places. In highs difficulty levels the success depends on reserves of turrets and mines, weapons do an exagerated lesser damage and the explosives are very dangerous at close range. The inventory space is not logical: you can carry really big guns but few of other items more needed as ammo and no portable medkits. With a turn based system and skills or perks would be better. The campaign is short, with few maps and arenas; buy only with a huge discount."
,Recommended,211280,31306007,Posted: 22 April,all,Verdantil,"Tags : Topdown ShooterTLDR: Exploration based. Solid entry in the genre. Limited ambitions but concentrates featureset on solid Xbox360 pad support, atmospheric environments and unlockable upgrades.Good core elements of the genre, co-op, not too frustrating, decent level design, some gamepad support, does not overuse zombie style enemies, and better than average visuals and sound for games of this genre and price tier. A central hub area to go from level to level, a large enough supply of stuff to buy with the money you gather, and a thin yet servicable plot. All these combined together allow this game to leave flash games territory and enter proper gaming territory. The game is not trash, and it is not a chore or feels like an utter waste of time to play. As far the money is concerned I would track down a bundle copy or buy 90% off however as this game is still severely lacking in many departments, it has unpolished edges, it does not  do anything new or interesting and does not have a ton of content."

The map builds were good, and there's plenty of different weapons, original picks, to go around. Nothing to complain there, nor with graphic and sound nor what you can enjoy from in the trailer.So why I feel this wasn't worth 18€? Because it's playability is horrible, to me at least. Maybe it's my old computer but I'd wager it's a bit more than that. It has a noticeable bug or two, definetely. This is a problem when the game progress is dependant on how well you can react. I swear the controls are a bit delayed, maybe to add realism, I dont know. But they are. You'd think it's better control-wise if you look at the video but be warned, it's not, especially if your computer lags behind. Modern titles like Diablo 3 may work on your computer with no problem at all, but even with the lowest performance settings this one will not.So, if you dont mind the ""hard"" controls and got a top-notch computer, and feel you must buy this, go for it. Other than that, I'd recommend you pass this."

76561197980884019,Not Recommended,211280,9830077,"Posted: 15 April, 2014",all,Cpt. Thought Process,"This mediocre game deserves its mediocre title. A rather one-track minded, repetitive top-down shooter in which your nameless character - or more accurately, your device for eliminating - shoot everything that moves without the slightest piece of narrative and were strategy is pretty much non-existent. Unless running backwards from hordes of foes while stamina decrease rapidly is considered a strategy.After a devastating chemical outbreak the world is infected by… no, not zombies, but mutated insects, refreshingly enough. You inexplicably start off by a helicopter (are you a pilot, a pilot/soldier, or are you simply a civilian admiring it?) and immediately within the next ten seconds the constant slaughter begin through seven levels providing one hour respectively.Store devices are (due to that missing strategy thing?) sporadically stationed across the levels. Through a fairly awkward menu, the game offers a nice variety of weapons in which you in all probability will be able to try out before completing the game. Purchasing these weapons as well as upgrading them obviously requires money which is earned by killing the abominations and by picking up money packs, encouraging you to explore every room and alley. To assist in acquiring these items, camera angles are adjustable to your advantage; however, every once and a while during heavy attacks these angles become a disadvantage.Shooting the low variety of second-rate designed insects that include giant ticks is repetitive and wooden with the occasional somewhat cool splashing effect. Evading hordes of enemies equal child’s play, because (unless you get stuck in a horde) you simply shoot and push the backwards button while observing that short amount of stamina. Unfortunately, they mysteriously tend to hit and charge at you from distance; in addition, the clumsy physics can block your way and disable your defense.The presentation of a fallen world is solid. Graphics are average, the sound is okay and the soundtrack is decent enough, though on several occasions the music tend to stop. The story on the other hand is downright thin and unessential, simply unfolded through identical looking newspapers that not only feel amateurish, but also suffers from a number of misspells. The atmosphere is quite insignificant and relatively easy-going; the suspense can be described as scary sweet as opposed to actually conveying the scary thrills, but it does pick up the pace of danger at least once on each level.Although Primal Fears has potential and is capable to bring a bunch of decent features, the rather dull, faulty and strikingly predictable gameplay is just as undeniable as the tiring title. Unless a major discount appears, this mediocrity is not a recommendation.5 / 10"

I got it on sale for about 69p and it really is not worth the full price. Its ok for a little while but id not pay anything over £2 for it. Game looks nice but every level is just the same old thing and it got boring. Worth a look on a sale price but not full. 5/10

I really feel stupid for buying this game. It's also very boring and very easy to get lost.Please download this or play a demo BEFORE buying this, and don't spend 8.99 on this crap."

You need to defend against a type of insect that comes to attack you. They can come in dozens. NOT CLEAR OBJECTIVES. Technically you just need to chill around and find what to do.Very complicated way to aim things. I would highly suggest making it a first person shooter. It would make it more exciting. It needs more improvements though.IT IS NOT A HORROR GAME. DONT SPECT A SCARY JUMP. NOT SCARY. All predictable, which is not a problem in many horror games, but it is only that they dont try to scare you.Didnt make it through hospital mission. Got to bored to finish it.FOR THE PRICE IS NOT WORFIT AT ALL!I would pay 2.50$ for this game. Not recommended at all if you are a single player guy. Not interactive, not attractive, not innovative and most of all, NOT FUN."
