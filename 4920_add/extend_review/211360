Lots of minor optimizations and hidden tricks that mean you can do a lot more than you initially thought, and do it much faster. It opens up every level to be re-analyzed again, this time looking for optimal strategies.I recommend this game regardless of which kind of game you prefer."

76561198173899526,Recommended,211360,33311336,Posted: 6 July,all,Groove Wizard,"I had an amazing time playing Offspring Fling.I dare say it's the best time-attack/puzzle platformer I've ever played. Yup, I do think it's better than Super Meat Boy.Why ? First, it's got nothing less, artistically-speaking. The universe, cutscenes and music are wonderful, and give the game a genuine, cutesy atmosphere which I find really enjoyable.Besides, the controls are irreproachable, and allow/reward pixel and frame-perfect action, for the most hardcore players.The level design is awesome too. Even among the hidden levels, which are diabolically difficult, none is unreasonably long, like in most SMB-like games, which makes the die-and-retry experience a lot less painful and frustrating, while still as rewarding.Finally, you can really play the game two ways. If you don't care about beating the best times on each level, you should find the game quite easy and refreshing, and you can enjoy the various changes of atmosphere as you make your way through the 100 first levels. Hence this game is perfect for kids and people who enjoy themselves some relaxed, casual playtime. It succeeds where most games fail miserably.Or you can try to beat all the dev times to unlock everything. It's a total new experience, and oh boy, that guy's serious. But I can tell you it's definitely worth it in the end.Plus you get to throw cute animals in the face of a dinosaur."

You can breeze through the entire game in about 3 hours if you're going for a gold flower on each level and a few more minutes if you want to beat the 10 postgame levels.Apparently, there are 10 more levels you can unlock past that, but it requires beating the staff times for the initial 110 levels. And honestly, I don't think that would be worth the trouble. Wrestling with the game's slippery controls to get the initial 100 gold flowers was already infuriating.If you're looking for a difficult platformer with much tighter controls, I'd reccomend Super Meat Boy. And if you want a puzzle platformer with some more content, give Toki Tori a try. Really, anything but this game."

You can stack them up and carry them, but it slows you down and you can't jump as high.

Mastering all the movement techs and improving your times to unlock the late game content takes quite a bit of effort, and beating the last stages feels really rewarding.

But, because of this, you'll need to be patient. There's a lot of levels to play, with 3 different grades defined by the time you spent to beat the level (blue = normal time; gold = good time; rainbow = excelent time).It may look simple, but it's not. There are some techniques that are necessary to learn in order to beat some levels.Although it's very hard, it's still very fun!

If you finnished over the par time you get a blue star or if you get par or under you get a golden flower. If you choose to replay the leavel you get to see a gost image of yourseld from the last play through you did to help better and improve yourself.If you got a gold star you see a gost image of the dev playing the leavel. The deve has a time lower then the par time but i dont know if something special happens if you pet the devs time because i havent been able to do it it.I have only played it at this stage on the keyboard and the controlls fell a bit slugish so you are proble better off using a controller but i cant confrem that.The menu is basic and apart from the level selection the it doesnt explain that well what the other selections are so it is trail and error. The option menu is basic and nnot much to speak of although it doent need much but would be nice if there was diffrent resuloution options.Over all it is fub and enjoubale and at times addictive. If you enjou pazzle platfomers and or like speed running games and enjoy challange your self to constle improve at leaves to see how fas you can do it then i recoment itEven if you not into the speed running part it is still a fun game to play or have a look you do get a sence of aclopshment and pride when you figure out a level.
