Smudged Cat Games have created a game with heart, intelligence and a mansion-load of well-applied ideas.You'll get their money's worth and more with this game. A puzzle/platformer that's not only challenging and addicting, but also adorable, Adventures of Shuggy is a title that gamers of any age and ability are sure to enjoy.If you're a fan of games like Super Meat Boy and you're looking for some interesting twists to the platforming genre, The Adventures of Shuggy is worth checking out. Smudged Cat's first entry in the big leagues is a promising start, and has me excited for the studio's next project.A short campaign is the only downside of this otherwise amazing platformer."
,Recommended,211440,7747413,"Posted: 25 November, 2013",all,Elleander,"A nice teleportation 2D puzzle platformer. A fair bit of levels, with nice, but not amazing graphics style. The game respects your intelligence in later levels well enough, but it's not crazy hard at the end. The co-op being local only really detracts from it, as it's a neat little addition to the game(Although it's really short). TL;DR Pick this up for a good ~5-6 hours of fun(A must-have if it's on sale)."

It's not that it's a bad game, just that it's an average game in a sea of much better games.  Shuggy is a platformer with a couple of unique tricks.  Unfortunately, it's marred by terrible controls that just feel off/ slippery.  The number of times that I died not because I did something wrong but because the controls failed me added up to a lot of frustration.  While the teleporter levels were fun, the timer levels were like pulling teeth.  Add in the resolution problems that this game has, and I was already on the fence.  The tiebreaker for me though was the fact that every single time you exit this game, you are presented with an ad for one of the developer's other games.  If you hit the wrong button, rather than exiting the game you are taken to the website for the game in the ad.  I'd just like to point out that a game I paid money for in Steam acts like a game I got on mobile for free :S  Not cool.  This game is a middle of the road 5/10."

The premise is to solve the puzzle of collecting all the gems in the individual rooms of a castle inherited by Shuggy using the different mechanics built into the game.As someone lacking the dexterity to play the super difficult platform style games of late, I really appreciate the fact that the mechanics are simple to understand and use, but at the same time offer some challenge.The challenge is in thinking through just exactly how to approach each room so you can move on.And the keyboard worked just fine for me.The graphics are cartoon style and very well done ---- clear and bright in every level. The music is really good keeping the mood bright.One of those games that you can get involved with for hours, and not be aware of the time that has gone by. All ages will enjoy this one."

Adorable little bat...thing Shuggy inherited a mansion from his uncle, but it's all haunted and stuff. To get the place in order he has to collect gems (it is ALWAYS gems) through more than 100 puzzle rooms and beat up some equally adorable bosses along the way. It's standard fare for a puzzle platformer, but what makes Shuggy shine is the variety in the puzzles. The devs took every gimmick they could think of short of an actual portal gun and mixed them up to round out the rooms. There are rooms with low gravity, reversed gravity, rotating gravity, rooms where you can fly, clones you can switch between, time travel, a personal teleporter, and my favorite, the magic rope. The rope trails out from a box in the room and you can use it to tangle up machinery, swing around like a monkey, and other neat tricks.In addition to the 100+ puzzles in the base game, there's also a fully separate co-op campaign and an additional level set that gives you an extra teleporter on top of the other gimmicks. All this comes in a charming package with sharp, colorful graphics and some sweet jazz accompaniment. It hooked me hard enough to finish all the levels in the base game and try my hand at the achievements, some of which are surprisingly challenging. For the money, it's well worth your time if you love adorable platformers at least half as much as I do."

It's just forgettable. The game has bite-sized levels ala Super Meat Boy, but where Meat Boy rewards a continual progression of skill Shuggy throws a lot of new gimmicks at you and never devlops any of them. Some levels require platforming, some are puzzly, and while that sounds good on paper most are so simple you just pass right through them first try. You don't need to play most levels to beat the game so realistically you can finish off the final boss by the hour mark. There are 100+ levels and I cleared them all (barring the local only co-op) in roughly four hours. I rarely felt like I was being asked to explore the mechanics in a meaningful way. So while the game technically isn't bad it's hard to tell people to get it when there are so many better platformers out there."

,Recommended,211440,8909116,"Posted: 30 January, 2014",all,Selenography,"A puzzle/platformer with a surprising amount of depth to it. There's plenty of challenge here, in the mould of some of the older NES games - albeit not quite as tough - with the most fragile vampire outside of Twilight. Shuggy has a variety of tricks at his disposal to help negotiate through the levels, and these assists change depending on the level. Teleportation, rotating the level itself, ropes, multiple Shuggys and even time travel are options open to you throughout the game.The genius of the game is that it challenges casual players, but is also designed around making life difficult for speedrunners. Many of the hazards seem to clog the optimal quickest route through a level, so if you want to replay levels and go for your best times, you'll appreciate the quality of the level design on display here. Throw in a very fun local co-op mode and a bunch of additional teleportation levels, and you have a game that can certainly keep you occupied.Smudged Cat have made a bit of a gem. Well worth your time if you enjoy reasonably difficult platformers."

,Not Recommended,211440,30111878,Posted: 22 February,all,winterpast,"Intro:Adventures of Shuggy isn't a bad game, but is it something I can really recommend?not really.I played through the game and while it gave me a decent time, it was pretty short and didn't offer anything unique. I won't have too much to say about this one.Gameplay:Adventures of Shuggy is a puzzle game with quite a lot of variety. It can be fun for a playthrough, but the real problem with the game is it completely lacks originality.There's so little to say. Its not really designed poorly at all. Its just a game that can't come close to standing out amongst the thousands of indie titles on Steam.It was updated to have a bunch more levels (free) so that's nice, but I don't care enough to re-install it.There is a co-op mode that could possibly be fun enough to make me recommend this game, but I've never played it considering its local only. Its also not very high on the list of local co-op games to play. If I'm gaming with a friend we have so many better options.Story, Visuals, & Music:I can't remember the story at all. I know it had one, but it was so bland that I've forgotten it. The visuals are just okay. It almost has that cheesy flash style, but I've seen worse. Its enough to not be an eyesore, but I can't say anything positive about the artstyle. I didn't like the music at all. I have nothing against the genre of music they use, but it just isn't very good. Its really cheesy and composed poorly at times. Not a pleasant game to listen to.PC Version:The game runs fine and all that. The only thing I can really say is the co-op mode is local only. This game came out 5 years ago, but really - get with the times. I find it lazy at this point for indie developers to have local co-op only. The developer went to the trouble of making a separate campaign mode, but didn't make it playable over the net? May as well spent that time adding more singleplayer content.Conclusion:I'll say it again - this game isn't bad at all. Its just incredibly mediocre.If you can get it for under a dollar or so then it might be worth it, but I see no reason to pick this game out of everything on Steam."
76561197983662248,Recommended,211440,12573296,"Posted: 19 October, 2014",all,TechieRefugee,"To start: I used to add a header to these reviews, but since it often made the review too long to submit, I've opted to leave it on my Backloggery.Gameplay: oh boy another puzzle platformer brought from XBLA time to not recommend it- Wait what? It's actually not half bad? ...you sure? Huh, so it is. Adventures of Shuggy is a puzzle platformer whose main attraction is many stage gimmicks. One stage may have you rotating the entire stage, another one may have you teleporting all over the place, another may have you be zombified so that you can jump and only jump... there's a lot of gimmicks. There's a lot of stages as well; 112 stages in the main game and 40 extra in the teleporter-focused mode. Out of all these levels, there were only seven or eight that I felt were legitimately kinda terrible. Fortunately, there's a lot more than that for levels that are really quite clever with, y'know, actual puzzles.The platforming itself isn't bad, and in fact there's really only one complaint I have about the platforming, and that is inertia. Shuggy actually has a lot of inertia, meaning that you can very easily end up falling off of a ledge due to your own inertia. You can kinda deal with it after a while, but it's still kinda obnoxious even once you get used to it. Another thing that could be a problem for some is that Shuggy is actually pretty dang fast. There is a bit of precise platforming here and there that could prove tricky for some due to how fast and how inertia-laden Shuggy is, but it never was the top speed that gave me any problems.There's also boss battles in the game, although they're more akin to boss battles from a game like Donkey Kong '94. I did quite like all of the bosses, and they all took at least some thought and careful planning to defeat. Again, they're, y'know, actual puzzles. It's hard really to talk too much more about this game's gameplay, as the core mechanics are quite simple, and the complexity of the game comes from these gimmicks. There was one gimmick that I enjoyed only about half of the implementations of (Shuggy temporal cloning) and one gimmick that I didn't like at all (wall-crawling Lemming carting around). Apart from those two gimmicks - and they're largely toward the beginning, so if that's causing you duress, just push through; it gets better - I had a great deal of fun with this game. Some other reviewers mentioned a lot of waiting around, but honestly; it's not all that bad. Unless you have super-ADHD, it's really not going to ruin your day. Unlike a lot of puzzle platformers, I can see myself coming back to this game in the future. For $5, it's a great deal. For the $0.49 I picked it up for during the Winter 2013 sale... that's highway robbery. 8/10.Story: There's not much, really. It's all told through a faux-comic book style presentation. It's honestly not worth rating, as it for the most part stays on the backburner for the gameplay to shine through.Graphics: It takes a bit of a hit here for two reasons. Reason one is that this game either windows in 720p or fullscreens in 720p. The portiness of this game is quite obvious here, since the 360's maximum resolution for gameplay was 720p. As for the art style... it's alright, but it really does have that ""XBLA-look"" to it. I'm not the best at pinning this sort of thing down, but I think it has to do with how the XNA kit handles gradients and sprites in general. It's not bad, but once again, it shows that this was once an XBLA game. Kinda disappointing, honestly. 2/5.Sound: Sound design isn't the biggest deal for this game; it's mainly some obvious sound effects and that's about it. As for the OST, it's not a thing that I'd get to listen to on my own time, but it's good enough in the context of the game. It's a decidedly jazzy OST which is partly why I'm not too keen on it, but that's because I'm 2dumb2jazz or something. If you're into that kind of thing, maybe you'll want the OST for yourself. 3/5.Overall scores are: 8/0/2/3; 6.5/10. A game with great gameplay design that is unfortunately hindered by some less-than-amazing AV stuffs. Again though, for $5 (and especially for $0.49), this game is a great deal, and will provide you with a day or two of mostly good times."

Maybe it gets better later, but I felt like I had had enough from the first half hour and did have the desire to play any more. Obviously this is not a full review, but just meant to share an experience of someone who played the game until they no longer wanted to play it and quit playing it.The controls felt a bit off to me, making me feel like I'd rather play Mario or some other platformer instead. Getting nearly all the crystals in a level and dying is frustrating in a bad way (as opposed to something like Bloodborne). What made me quit was a level where the character stands sideways and gravity is flipped 90 degrees, but you have to press up and down to control him rather than left and right. Usually I like flipping levels like this, but just found it disorienting.Not a bad game, but didn't find it to be a good one, either."
,Not Recommended,211440,33088117,Posted: 1 July,all,DisasterMo,"This is not a horrible game, but it's still hard to recommend.Adventures of Shuggy is an unremarkable puzzle platformer with a story so generic it might as well not exist.The premise is simple: find all the gems in each level with the help of a given level's mechanic, while avoiding any source of danger.Most levels have one (rarely more) of several quirks: infinite jumps, super high jumps and gliding, rotating levels, a rope to hang on to and activate mechanisms with, etc.Sounds like a diverse experience, and at first it is! So, what is wrong with it?Level designThe further you get into a game, the more challenging it should become, that's what we are all familiar with. Unfortunately, ""more challenging"" means ""with more stuff on screen with seemingly random movesets for the player to keep an eye on and avoid in even larger levels"" in this game.This approach is just not fitting for a puzzle platformer. Simply using more enemies to obstruct the player's way is not good level design. As for the level size, did I mention that you die in one hit, and when you do, you have to redo the entire level? Thus a level becomes more frustrating the larger it gets.But this would not be a big problem if not for the...Controls and Hit DetectionThe Controls are a little too floaty and unruly for this kind of game: You accelerate too fast, even in midair, and you never stop exactly when you let go of the directional button, which is crucial in a game where the hit-box detection is so unforgiving.Countless times have I fallen to my virtual doom because Shuggy would not jump off a ledge properly or hit his... eye (or something, since I am certain it could not have been the top of his head) on one while trying to jump onto it.ConclusionI dunno.I wouldn't recommend this game purely because I find that there are games that do everything, the puzzles, the platforming and the presentation, way better and are more deserving of your time. If you feel otherwise or really want to try this game out, then that's fine. Like I said, it's not a horrible game. Just seems frustrating, unfulfilling and kind of boring to me."

,Recommended,211440,2020555,"Posted: 20 August, 2013",all,Twistor,"Casual puzzle-platformer with very simple yet diverse puzzles. Take time travel, switching characters, rotating levels or only parts thereof, teleportation, Worms (tm) rope mechanics and alternating gravity (and associated weird controls), put them in a blender, add instadeath and puzzles. Serve as platformer. The result is Adventures of Shuggy. Funny, yet at times frustrating. Every level has its own special ability/limitation that you have to exploit to complete it. Some of the puzzles are very intriguing and the game's physics engine has been used extensively. Only thing I didn't like was the mozzie, a wasp that flew seemingly randomly and was therefore difficult to dodge.Simple, yet not too easy, a hardcore gamer will find challenge at least in trying to complete the cooperative levels as a single player. There are also a couple of difficult teleportation and time travel levels that need lots of planning. You will need a really good coordination (or lots of practice) to survive some levels. Playing this game cooperative might be fun as well, the challenges of coordination changing to lesser challenges of communication.If you like puzzle games and you're fine with platforming, this one is a very good game for its price. You'll get some 3 to 6 hours of fun out of it, more if you go by my ""single player cooperative challenge""."

It has a bunch of interesting mechanics ranging from fairly standard tried and tested ideas like rope swinging or a super jump to more unique mechanics such as the time travel levels in which an echo of your past self follows along your exact path and kills you upon contact, forcing you to consider your steps so that you can come back later without bumping into yourself, normally with multiple past Shuggys running around at once making it fairly hectic. New mechanics are introduced at a healthy pace rather than throwing them all at the player at once, allowing for a fairly intuitive game experience. Boss levels are also mostly well designed with only minimal exceptions. You will die repeatedly and frequently but rather than cheap, frustrating deaths they can normally be learned from and then avoided. The soundtrack and art style especially give it a lot of character too, and you are not required to 100% the game in order to complete the main story which given the difficulty of some of its hardest levels is a blessing.

This puzzler pits you as a young vampire who has just inherited his grandfather's problem riddled mansion and it is up to you to fix it.The graphics of this game seem reasonably polished although there is not much that's animated besides the main character.Unlike VVVVV with a driving soundtrack that kept you playing, the music feels like a bland set of fill tracks that do little for the ears.I'd like a brief description of the gameplay but I can't get more specific than saying it's a puzzle-platformer because I feel this game suffers from the ADHD of gameplay. There are a lot of mechanics in this game, I mean a lot, and they vary per level and there doesn't seem to be much of a logical progression. More doesn't always mean better and in my opinion this game would be better if it focused on a limited number of mechanics and developed them better. The vast amount of mechanics in this game made the experience feel disjointed. It didn't seem like the levels were too carefully designed as many of them were unsatisfying and some even boring.In a level in the third area I found an obvious bug that was very easily reproducable. This bug ended my time with this game.This game does feature controller support and local coop with levels especially designed for two players.If you are a huge fan of these types of games, and you've exhausted all your other options, you may derive some amusement from this.

Each level is a different room. Sort of like Bubble Bobble (not Puzzle Bobble lol).It looks good. I liked the player character. There are cutscenes (graphic stills).Every level has it’s own twist e.g. you might have access to three separate player characters which you can alternate between, you might be able rotate the entire room and so on. The game has a lot of variety because of this I don’t think I played the more than two levels with the same characteristics. Precise movements were sometimes a little tricky with the keyboard.It was fun. Easy to get the hang of. The rooms became increasingly complex and challenging. I just wish I could have encountered a boss in the time that I played.Probably worth the full price on steam of $4.99 when you are looking for something new to play.

However, there are enough elements constantly changing within each and every level that it will keep you on your toes.

You collect gems to clear levels, and are obstructed by the usual suspects. Shuggy dies in one hit, but the level restarts instantly.You get a jump button, and an action button that sometimes gives you a unique ability. There are some great mechanics, like time-traveling clones (death to meet yourself), a rope for spelunking, level rotation, size changing, multiple Shuggys... and one that made me ROFL. Mechanic introductions and combinations are paced well.Once you've beaten a level, you can replay it in time attack mode, with your best time counting down. There are also leaderboards.The platforming controls are a little finicky. It is hard to hit the key lightly enough to make small jumps.That's a pretty small quibble with a very solid game.

The story is simple, but is animated nicely through several comics. In addition to the story mode, there are dozens of co-op and extra teleporting levels for added challenge and fun.Unlike many puzzlers, I found the difficulty curve for the main campaign fairly nice and not overly difficult, but still presenting a decent challenge. You do not have to complete all of the levels in a certain order -- you only have to unlock and beat the boss level in each of the five-ish rooms, as well as beating a certain amount of levels total. Of course, its more fun to beat them all. You can try levels again for a better time and to compete against players on a leaderboard, which for the most part doesn't seem hacked yet like many other games.Most levels after the first few have some sort of ""trick"" and/or puzzle elements with switches you have to activate in a certain order. Some examples of the tricks are using a rope (sometimes with gears), getting little ball creatures to a certain point, rotating the whole or parts of the stage, and the enemies and a harmful version of you traveling back in time. Other tricks are infinite jumps and long jumps with a hover ability.Try it out!"

There is time travel, clones, rotating gravity and much more. The closest game would be Braid, but where Braid takes itself maybe too seriously, this game has a very cheerful, humorous approach. The graphics are cute, and the music is in ""feel-good"" style, reminding circus attractions and theme parks.The only thing I really didn't like is the platformer-typical challenge to manual dexterity such games usually present atop their puzzles. Namely, even if you already guessed how a puzzle level needs to be solved, it still can take many frustrating attempts to execute the solution without a mistake to the very end, especially with this game's 1-hp instant death rule. Also the character here has this annoying ""sliding animation"" which makes him slide for a while after landing on a platform. This may make the simplest task of jumping across a series of small platforms surprisingly difficult to perform for a new player. You either slide over the platform after landing and end up on spikes below, or you try to slow down while in mid-air, press the button to move in the opposite direction, but hold it for just a fraction of a second too long, and end up falling straight down, not reaching the platform you wanted to land on. This inertia is actually not very typical for 2D platformer games and probably shouldn't be in this game at all."
