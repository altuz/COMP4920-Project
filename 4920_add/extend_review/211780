,Recommended,211780,28250792,"Posted: 8 December, 2016",all,✿ Blinky ♥,"Conflict: Desert Storm is a personal childhood favourite. I put many hours into the PlayStation 2 version of this title in the early 00's. Therefore, I write this review with a nostalgic bias, however I hope it can prove useful to anyone not yet familiar with the game :)Pros:Control up to 4 characters at once.Multiple character control allows for entertaining tactical approach to missions.Each character represents a specialist class, featuring different weapon types.Decent campaign length, promising multiple hours of playtime.Controllable vehicles in certain missions.Training mode with three levels to introduce game mechanics effectively.Choose between a British or US squad. This affects their appearance and accents.Competitive local multiplayer mode.Save whenever you want during a mission, up to twice per mission.Cons:NO COOP MULTIPLAYER, like that of the console version. I was disappointed to discover this ommission in the PC release.Dated graphics (PlayStation 2 era), but it retains its own charm, and isn't harsh to look at.Long loading times (I assume the loading bar's programmed to run for a predetermined time, because of how predictable the load time was on the PlayStation 2. So an SSD won't help with this).Game and control options are only saved to individual savegames, and not to a global setting file. You will need to load a save to restore any changed settings.The lower a vehicle's health, the lower its maximum movement speed gets, so your vehicle can become useless well before it is destroyed. The Humvee is particularly susceptible to this.Some weapons, especially pistols, feel way too inaccurate. Point-blank misses are possible.Predictable enemy AI, and spawn pattern, however this can add to the fun depending on your style. Mow them down in practically single-file.Despite the game's legitimate short-comings, I still recommend it as a worthwhile military gaming experience. Each mission is a good length, and well designed. I still have my fun with this title, and maybe you could too :D"

Gameplay mostly consists of completing multiple objectives in a non-linear level, with some missions involving the use of vehicles. Along with a minor empthais on stealth.Each member of the squad has their own specialization and equipment. Though, the skill system is mostly the soldier's familiarity with their own unique primary weapon, pistol, and a special item (ie: medkit, rocket launcer).Even though I've enjoyed this game and have done multiple playthroughs, it does have some slight issues, but most of these can be overlooked."

Don't get me started on the sound.To anyone who stumbles over this the for first time, drop it unless you're interested in a semi-decent co-op game, which might last you a weekend or two.If you're a veteran of the series and looking to get back into it, I say drop this one and get Desert Storm II: Back to Baghdad (or get this one and then get Back to Baghdad).At the end of the day, however, I must still recommend it, because I would be doing a disservice to all the fun memories I had with this game back when it first came out. It's a lacking game, but anyone who played this on the consoles either loved it or is a bunch of negativity I don't need in my life."

No.TL:DRPC PortPros:- Nostalgia- Very difficult on Hard Setting. (Good for those that enjoy a challenge)Cons:- Many, many, many, many game breaking glitches.- Old school clunky controls and aiming.Full Review:While Conflict is an awesome series that I highly recommend people to play, even though it is dated, I do not recommend playing this PC Ported version. It's rife with glitches and bugs which are glaringly apparent from the start.From the first training mission I found my character unable to drop down off of a ledge. Instead, he continued to bug out and ""float"" accross the map as I moved him in different directions. In doing so I was able to go behind the railing where the staff sergeant stood and poke around ""behind the scenes"" a bit.However, this didn't stop me from pushing forward into the game. ""So,"" I said to myself, ""I'll just say forget the training missions and try to play the actual campaign."" This also, did not end well. I decided to play it on hard mode as I always enjoy a good challenge. I died a lot, but I'm not one to complain, just learn from it and learn the game mechanics (or in this case, remember, as it's been many years since I last played).As I continued further into the map I got myself cornered inside of a building with 1 way in, 1 way out. The enemies kept coming, but I kept putting them down, shooting them before they had the chance to shoot me. Finally I take a peek around the corner to see if there's more. Yup, there's roughly 3 more. So I fall back into the room and let them continue towards me. Kill the first two... Waiting for that third one. I see him come around the corner, and BAM BAM BAM! Wait... I missed? How is he 5 feet in the air!?!? And I die.I can deal with the occasional glitch/bug here and there. But from the 55 minutes I played, I ran into approximately 5 or more, most being identical glitches that were reaccuring. I figured that maybe I was the only one having issues, but I've read quite a few reviews stating as such.No matter how high your nostalgia level is, please, for your own safety, and so you don't get any heartbreak, do not purchase this until it's been probably ported for the PC."

The graphics are actually very good, considering how long ago this was made. The actual gameplay is just brilliant and provides a good challenge. The AI is way better than I thought it would be. Just to give you an example, I entered this small cabin and about three enemies came running in and I shot them down. They fell just outside the doorway. I waited for a while and assumed all was good. As I stepped foot outside, I was raked down by four guys waiting for me to leave, presumable after seeing the dead bodies. Even today, games don't have that kind of complexity to their AI. Granted it could have been coincidence. Nevertheless, this is a solid game and great fun. I'm suprised that the Conflict games didn't go on to become what arma is now. Definitely worth a buy, especially if you played this when you were younger. You will love it."

I played this so much when I was still a console gamer. I played countless hours of this game with my brothers. I remember how intense it got when we got in a firefight. Throughout the missions you add a few more guys to your squad. Sending commands were very easy and made sense. You can play this on your PC but the controls are just awful. I love this game, but the controls are just so awful it ruins it. If I was writing this review for PS2 I would recommend this, but for PC I can't recommend this.

,Recommended,211780,11941690,"Posted: 31 August, 2014",all,PRC - 319,"Oh the greatest war game I've ever played. I've played tons but this just made all war games for me on the old PS2.On a more serious note...This game features 15 not very diverse missions that can make a lot of gamers (new and experienced) want to throw their keyboard out the window. CDS is difficult. But once you get used to the controls (and have beaten the game more than once), it becomes a cakewalk. This game lasts roughly 5 hours playing through missions in a tactical not-quite-run-n-gun playstyle.As for the PC-Port, well, it's a 2002 game, so I won't be as harsh. The port for this game onto PC is quite inferior to that of the PS2 or Orig. Xbox. It does feature graphical options like switching displays before launch (for those with multiple monitor setups), extrended draw distance, texture quality, and runs in a stunning DirectX 8.0! Though, with all these considered, the control-scheme and technical side of the game is a bit lacking. The save-game system can stop working if you perform a factory refresh or something like that. The control-scheme, like skill, is heavily based off of experience. It is going to be very difficult to control everything in the game for a newbie. CDS has a very wonky control-scheme that can throw off one who is used to newer and more polished PC games. Though, these criticisms should be taken with a grain of salt, as this is still a 14 year old game that is from a time where PC-gaming was still somewhat primative comparatively to now.As for the missions...The majority of the game will take place in a desert scene, some with overtaking sandstorms present. Difficulty curve seems normal, with the exception being the first mission. You'll occasionally find missions taking place during nighttime, and usually these missions involve some slight stealth aspects to them (though not many). By the 3rd mission, you will be playing with all 4 characters Bradley, Foley, Connors, and Jones. Respectively, these are your squad leader, marksman, heavy weapons specialist, and demolitions/infiltration specialist. They each earn their own rank and can level up certain skills for sniping, rocket launcher, combat engineering, medic, etc.Because this review is getting quite long, I'll cut it here with the conclusion: This game is great for those nostalgic and wanting a tactical 3rd person shooter to play."

Desert Storm has cars, tanks, explosives, and guns. The PC version has a legitimate multiplayer mode, not just co-op like the console version (which kinda freaked me out). This is not one of those pesky run and gun shooters, this game requires legitimate strategy and cooperation. Did I meation that this game is awesome yet? Because it is.

I played this game over multiple times back when I owned a PS2 and it never got old. After playing it again on PC, it's just as fun as when I first played it on PS2, but compared to a lot of newer squad-based shooters, it definitely shows its age. The PC port is almost identical to the PS2 version (can't compare it to the Xbox version, since I never played it on Xbox), however there are a few small issues with the PC version.I've noticed that there are some sound glitches when firing in single shot mode quickly. Some of the gun sound fx don't play with each mouse press, but this isn't a huge issue. The other PC-specific issue I've noticed is that custom key bindings don't seem to function, however, I don't know if this functionality was ever implemented in the first place. The default key bindings work okay, but I found myself in several situations where I needed to both move and access my inventory or give a squadmate an order. When opening up either the inventory or the squad menu, my character would stop moving, and in quite a few cases, that opened me up to enemy fire. Not good.The pluses far outweigh the few with Conflict Desert Storm. The missions are solid and some can take multiple attempts to ""get right"" if I try to go for a stealth playthrough. The game mechanics are well-thought out, and include things like fire options (ie semi, burst, and full auto), issuing squad commands and being able to give or take items from teammates inventories. If you're looking to take a trip down memory lane or want to experience a unique squad-based shooter, I definitely recommend it."

Sadly, there is none in this version.Still a recommended game if you can get around the control scheme.PS - Foley is the best."

But now im flying through each mission understanding all everything now. 10/10 one of the best army games. Older than SOCOM, but SOCOM too is even better."
