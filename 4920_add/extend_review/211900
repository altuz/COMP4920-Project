76561198042281318,Recommended,211900,17074041,"Posted: 16 July, 2015",all,Sairvell,"This game has such primitive graphics that I think I would have turned my nose up at it were I to load it onto my Amiga 500, circa 1987. The sounds are atrocious, though the operatic soundtrack isn't bad. Combat just runs without any input from you. Your units hop up and down in clumsy drawn-out All-my-guys-go then all-your-guys-go rounds. It's impossible to recommened this game based on the way it looks or sounds. If you crave lots of colorful, well executed feedback and fireworks then this game isn't for you.If, however, you enjoy truly diverse factions, random maps, tons of monsters, spells and items, executable at a reasonably fast pace, then you will find much to like about Conquest of Elysium.Rather than attempting to describe the many factions or the different eras that you can play in, as well as the many ways to go about engineering total domination, I'd rather relate an impromptu story that I discovered while playing.I'd started as the Troll King for no other reason than that I relish having a giant with which to roam the landscape from the very first turn of the game.Well into the run I'd developed a sizable squad of armored, regenerating trolls that had been the front line for a vast army of goblin archers. While there were enough trolls with enough hit points and armor to absorb serious frontal assaults, they couldn't protect my numerous, but vulnerable, archers from the spells of an enemy Pyromancer that I'd stumbled into.My trolls didn't care for immolation but they were tough enough to survive the blaze. All my goblin archers, except one lone fellow, were incinerated.I was momentarily amused by my single tiny camp follower for my troll army and figured I'd eventually make it back to a city where I could recruit more archers. It was not to be, however, because I found myself pushing farther and farther into enemy territory: even without the support of sixty screaming goblin sharpshooters, my trolls were laying waste.Fight after fight, I marched across the map, more than a dozen armored trolls accompanying the Troll King with this one goblin who hung around in the back.Perhaps an hour into this Sherman's March, I began noticing that the goblin was comically ineffective. All the trolls would attack and then this one sad goblin would shoot a single arrow, never hitting anything.After several battles, I finally clicked on the little guy and was amazed by what I saw.This one goblin had maxed out his level, lost both eyes (which explained all the missing), lost one arm (which doesn't explain how he still managed to shoot his bow), was lamed and had a chest injury that reduced his hit points to the level that a fairy farting at him would have put him in the ground.I was astounded at how this guy kept kicking along in the company of a massive troll army, fighting devils and hordes of undead, dragons and wizards. Not only had he survived, but he'd become the ultimate veteran. I couldn't help but to imagine this poor wrecked creature and wonder: how does he manage?I decided that he was sort of a mascot to the trolls, a seemingly immortal mystery that they largely ignored. They allowed him to follow along as a curiosity, feeding him tidbits and saving him from wandering into holes and what not, if only to see how many more battles he could survive, one-armed, lamed and blind.My imagination went so far as to picture some of his stray shots hitting his troll allies in the back, but that they were so ineffective that the only response to getting shot by the goblin was the laughter and pointing of your troll comrades-in-slaughter.I'd never have made up that little story if there weren't so many status effects, magic items, buffs and curses and so very many enemy types available to mix and match. By keeping track of individual unit's injuries in such detail and allowing them to accumulate scars and  skills makes them into characters.If you can look past the presentational limitations, there is a ton of content and gameplay, supporting many different styles, for anyone looking for a fast-paced turn-based (is that even possible?) strategy game. Should the high fantasy genre appeal, then this one provides all the grist a fertile imagination requires."

76561198001807171,Recommended,211900,13655561,"Posted: 27 December, 2014",all,Starner,"Intro:Conquest of Elysium 3 is the latest in the CoE series made by Illwinter, who are also the designers of the Dominions series. In simple terms the game is about raising armies to defeat your opponenets. At the start of each game you select a class to play which determines how you go about raising your armies or what your fighting style is. An example is the enchanter class, at the start most of your army is composed of generic soldiers until you get resources to summon powerful constructs and golems in the mid to late game.Pros:-There are 18 different classes to pick from each having cool special abilities and playstyles unique to them.-There are many cool units and magic spells to mess with.-Games play quickly and end faster than most strategy games.-Random generated maps allow for endless play.Cons:-The graphics are rather lacking.-The unit animations are also rather lacking.-Lots of unit stats to sift through.-Some matches are doomed from the start due to bad spawn areas.Bottom Line:If you enjoy a strategy game where everytime you play you learn something new this game is for you. If you are short on time a lot but you love to play complex strategy games this is for you as well. If you are a person who cares about graphics do not pick this up, likewise if you are not willing to (possibly) read a manual sometimes then do not pick this up either. Illwinter has made many improvements from Conquest of Elysium 2 and at the cheap price of ten dollars it could be argued that this game beats many modern strategy games in terms of features and replayability."

In lieu of a review, here's some very early impressions:- ♥♥♥♥. Why did i buy this?- I SO don't want to play this game.- I don't even. All these stats... And the clunky menus.- Allright lets get her holy high highnessness out there a-conquering. A cannibal camp... Oh well, gets me a ritual sacrifice bonus.- Crap, you front line spearmen need to stay alive.- Hahaha, suck on 3rd degree incineration spells hob.. er, half.. er. gn... whatever the hell you are, hahaha!- Damn you and the planes you spawned on, and all other untis that show up to be recruited for 50 gold when i have 49! Still, with cheap summoning i get lots of fresh units. Mostly tiny rats and spiders. :\ Ooh o.O Giant Spider! That's more like it!- Aw, crapdamn! Lost a town to 4 wolves. 4. Wolves. 4! C'mon town! Mmkay whatever, i'll just have this caster with leadership take a few archers and summoned monsters go and take it back. They can stop by the capital to pick up new recruits as well.- Wait did my rookie summonamancer just blindly luck into summoning a demigod stronker than 3-4 of my combined armies???! Oooh, and he's a front row melee attacker, sweet!- Damn these cheap summoning rituals, i'm up to my ascots in rats and scorpions. At least they soak damage really well.- That... that giant moose is honestly too big. I heard of not seeing the forest from the trees but never a forest from a moose. Seriously.At this point i have 4 stacks of mixed melee/archers/casters stomping things, leveling up, collecting shiny swords and boots of flight, and generally spreading peace, love and understanding of the Cult of the mad blood god whose return shall end the world in pools of pizza sauce.The game is relatively straightforwad even if it takes a bit of figuring out. Time wasting features are thrown right out and all that is left aims to streamline fantasy flavored, turn based conquering. Might sound featureless but the unit type and terrain diversity, not to mention hosts of spells and artifacts, season changes and random events all keep your campaign interesting. Plus even mooks get item slots, so you will find plenty of uses for shiny loot.I can't accurately appraise this game. Not at this time. Ok maybe i can. It's a victory of substance over generic shinied sparkly baubleness. You might wonder why a prettier game wouldn't ever have decent, simple and honest fun mechanics, but the anwser is in the question. If you have a VERY shiny wrapper, then you'd be a fool to put anything better than a turd in it.

It reminds me a lot of Master of Magic.  There is no control in combat, and the game does not focus on research or city building, but instead, the acquisition of units and capture of cities/towns/villages/mines/outposts/towers/etc.  With each capture, you increase your income, build your army, and set out to explore the map and find and conquer your enemies.There are numberous races in this game, and most of them play differently.  It's enough to keep me interested to keep playing and learning how they each work.  There are a massive number of unique units, there are magic items you can find and equip, and random world events which can be good or bad... losing a town due to a meteor is never fun, but it sure keeps it interesting!The game has multiplayer as well.  My friend and I play all the time, and I can say after numerous games, that this is a stable, polished, and enjoyable game to play, either single-player or multiplayer.  If you are into the turn-based world domination, my army is bigger than yours but not necessarily better type games, which offer randomly generated maps, exploration, and a whole bunch of other cool stuff, I'd highly recommend this one.The learning curve for CoE3 is a bit steep, but most of the information you can find in the games manual.  The graphics are not top-notch, but if you grew up on 90's gaming, the nostalgia is great!"

The graphics are very simple (think Civ 2), but gameplay is excellent, with many interesting choices to make and no obvious dominant strategy. Each of the 18 classes plays very differently from the others. It is not a pure strategy game as there elements of random chance in certain actions, most prominently in combat.

There is a great variety of races to play with heaps of interesting and different units.  It is more strategy than tactics: you choose your army composition but the computer plays out battles automatically.  You need to pay attention to ensure your heroes don't kill your own army with their spells, a creeping doom will single-handedly destroy your huge army of recruited units and the RNG will sometimes make you cry, but overcoming the challenges and emerging victorious is extremely satisfying."

There is a hypnotic rhythm to the turns, and 60 turns in you can still process a turn in just a couple of minutes, letting you avoid the bogged down feeling you get with so many similar games in the mid-late game.  Given, there are warts galore and lots of areas for improvement with the interface and AI, but it's such an elegant concept. The factions really play differently from each other and it is well worth your time spending a few games with each.  Give it a go, or try COE 4 due out mid-November. It's also a great introduction to Illwinter's Dominions 4 which is a crazy deep deep deep deep game that i'm still just scratching the surface of."

I might even enjoy this better, because it seems faster paced and less serious.  You don't need much time investment to the starting game settings like in Dominions.  Instead it's more of a rogue-like (I wanted to use this term rogue-like in an earlier review and thought ""no all the rogue-like fans will get all over me about that"" - but then saw another review using the term ""rogue-like 4x"" - yes that describes this game very well).It's a rogue-like 4x with game saves!  SAVES!  Okay?  All you rogue-like developer nutso's - think about adding game-saves to your rogue-likes - because I for one welcome our rogue-like game-saving not so much punsih the player when he makes a mistake overlords.Okay.. so what else can I tell you?The variety that's in Dominions still seems to be here - or most of it anyways.  It's just buried under the hood.  If I had a choice and could only buy one game between Dominions and Conquest of Elysium - I think I would pick this, just because it's a little more fun and not as taxing to play.The game is so fast-paced (for a 4x) that several games can be played in succession.  Yet it still has very much a Civilization 1 feeling to it.Lastly, the sound effects (I know.. right?) - the sound effects are pleasant and not overbearing, if simplistic.

It's a little gem, a modern Master of Magic, streamlined and simpler but with a richness that stems from the vast treasure-trove of creatures, spells and unique races already made by Illwinter. While you may be familiar with many creatures from playing Dominions, Conquest of Elysium builds on the familiar and adds twists that make it a very different experience. Dominions is for the grand strategy, long turns and slow pace with lots of planning even before the game begins. Elysium is fast, smooth, clean and streamlined. It has a lot of depth without ever overwhelming you with it. The creatures have a massive collection of traits (all with icons) that make them much more than cosmetically different. Your magical resources are only seen by those able to use them - so you're never overwhelmed by having to keep track of gems/herbs/weeds/hands of glory...etc. If you have someone who can use a new resource then you're able to see it on the map, if you don't then you can't see or claim it. It's one of the little things that helps new players. It's simple, elegant and eases you into the game gently.Simple, yes. But that isn't to say the game is easy. It's easy to lose and tricky to win. Early mistakes can end the game, losing all your commanders and castles ends the game so there's always some risk from stealthy bandits and animals capturing your castle or some invulnerable creeping doom rolling over your army. At the end of the game, the streamlined options makes the AI smarter and stronger than I've come to expect from many 'modern' games. Even on the default 'jester' difficulty setting the AI can have large armies that are quite happy to attack your towns and castles and use all the magic they have available.I've not played as every race yet, but I'm looking forward to doing so. I'm looking forward to team games, trying the different map sizes, the different ages of the world and to seeing what other hidden gems I'll find. I hope you get a chance to do all that too.So...

It's like what many reviewers are saying, that it is deeper than it first appears.  It's kind of like master of magic except you can't go into your town and build buildings and stuff.  It's more like Heroes of might and magic where you explore the map, fight battles, and gain control of strategic locations that increase your resources.  The resources are then used to increase your army strength.Be aware that the battles are automatic.  No battle tactics, only tactics on the strategic map.Keep in mind, there is no town/castle management.  Also it is not very pretty.  There is no tutorial or even anything to read on how to play.  There is a list of keyboard controls that you can bring up.  By continuously bringing that list up and experimenting I was able to figure out how to play after 3 or 4 little test games.There is 10 or so different leaders to start out with and they are pretty different.  Some use magic and can summon guys  to fight.  Others might only be able to recruit guys with money you earn.

The game is hilariously retro, it is basically the fantasy world conquest game that everyone would have made in 1978 if the technology had allowed it.The good news is that the gameplay itself is great, replayability is huge, and most of the possible sides differ greatly from one another in so far as the best ways to play them. They are also sometimes quite unexpected - for example, the Dwarves are some sort of bees, apparently? The AI is nothing special, but it's adequate.

The economy system is extremely innovative as different classes (armies) gather different types of resources from the same terrain.  For example, a Baron (the knightly themed army) gathers an increased amount of gold from his villages and towns but finds little of value on forest squares, while a Druid gathers plants from the wild to produce his special units.A very unique, yet nostalgic feel to this game.

The real work went into the Rule-set, Gameplay, and 17 different playable Races/Classes that each have unique strengths & weaknesses. Add to those 17 Classes the epic number & variety of wandering independent monsters and the fact that Maps are randomly generated (a Map Editor is included to create your own, as well) and the replayability value of the Game is pretty impressive!"

I'd be reluctant to call it 4x, though.  Although it has all aspects of it (eXplore, eXpand, eXploit, and eXterminate), it doesn't have any other characteristics associated with 4x genre - there is no micromanagement, you can't choose different strategies for a battle, and there are no multiple ways to win the game (you have to defeat all the other factions).  I'd be prone to add 'casual' tag to it, since you don't really need to dedicate much planning and thinking to it.The best thing about the game is it's high replay value.  There are many factions they play differently and there are multiple possibilities for the terrain.You can see from the screenshots that the graphics are no high tech, but suitable for the game.  Music is also not very exciting.The worst thing about the game is lack of any tutorial, and it's not very straight forward.  So I had to read the manual to figure out what to do.Score: 7.5 of 10"

If you like turn-based strategy games at all, this game will be very fun and addictive.(Some of it isnt very intuitive though, and there are no pop-up tips for new players. So either skim the manual, keep it open in a side window, or be patient until you figure the interface/mechanics out. Or catch a youtube getting started video) The other descriptions say it is very similar to the Civilization games, but it is far more similar to the Heroes of Might and Magic series. (there is no technology research or diplomacy or city/town improvements to build.) Armies can only move when a ""hero"" type unit is leading it. Heroes are the only way to claim the resource generating nodes on the map. The map is far more active than in Heroes of M&M though, with monsters being generated very frequently from ""neutral camps"" like ancient forests and brigand camps, until you take a hero and go clear them out and claim them, and there are random spawn events that happen to keep you from getting too comfortable. The animals will randomly wander and make you lose control of things they move over, while brigands are evil and smart and will go directly for capturing towns and villages away from you and will garrison them and they are stealthy about it.(essentially they are stealthed or cloaked and cant be seen except by running over them by accident or by bringing a stealth-detecting unit with your army, etc.)The game really shines in the strategy department. Unlike Civilization or Heroes of M&M, the class type you choose will have HUGE implications for how strategies will work (instead of minor differences), it decides what heroes you will have access to, what armies you will be able to create with heroes via magic(if any), what unit types you will be able to purchase at towns you control, bonuses with certain terrain types, weaknesses and strengths with the general types of units you have acess to, etc. Unlike most competivite strategy games the resources themselves are varied and can only be collected by the appropriate hero types. For instance a witch will claim forests and swamps to get an income of fungus to use for making magical brews to summon nature spirits for their armies. A demonologist will want to claim towns and villages in order to get an income of 'sacrifices' to summon demons for their armies. And this is just a piece of the differences.The combat itself is automated, which was annoying at first, but then I saw why later. You get so many random fights, and some fights with hero vs hero where both sides have 100+ units each, it would burn anyone out to try to control that turn by turn, unit by unit through a combat. In fact, dont miss out on the combat speed control in the upper gith hand corner of the battle screen. You will eventually tire of watching every combat play out at regular speed and will want to be able to speed it up using those controls. Also note that for your heroes and armies that can cast spells, you can inspect them outside combat to choose what spells they have ready for combat.(you dont want a frost demon to blast every creature on the battlefield with a frost attack if you have troops that could get hurt from it on your side, or you dont want to go into a fight with fire spells memorized if you know the enemy hero has tons of fire immune creatures, etc.) Also, it pays to take note of the magical items you find in your travels and from killing enemy heroes. You can trade them around between heroes, and even with your individual army members. (aka - one of your heroes finds a weapon but has one equipped already? if one of your armies he is leading could use it, they will pick it up and use it instead of it going to waste.)"

If you're curious but don't want to commit to cash quite yet I recommend you check out CoE2 available for free from Illwinter's site as a free download. It's a lot more limited than this version of the game, but will give you a pretty good feel for how it handles.On the good side, if you're looking for a streamlined fantasy 4X that offers a unique collection of races and play mechanics, this might be your games (I especially enjoyed Illwinter's take on why you never see any female dwarfs). It's really satisfying to finally round up enough innocents to summon demon lords, or to finally complete the necromantic ritual which will turn you into an immortal vampire in an old, abandoned castle.On the bad side, Illwinter doesn't really care that much about UI. In the Dominions series (which has gotten a lot better on this front) it was the price of admission for a really unique strategy game. With the stripped down CoE approach, the lapses in UI design feel a lot less forgivable. For example, there's no smooth way to start a new game without exiting and launching the game again. Unit moves can't be cued, so you spend a lot of time babysitting commanders on there way back to grab reinforcements.Past the interface, the abundance of unfriendly fauna can get rather obnoxious. While it's cool that you need to be careful early on, by mid game marauding bands of deer taking unprotected farms just gets annoying. Commanders are a limited resource in the game, so keeping them on hand for pest control can get frustrating. Plus I'm unaware of any kind of ""major events"" summary, so I spend a lot of time at the beginning of each turn checking my domain and making sure Bambi isn't stirring up any trouble. Then on larger maps you can have to cross fields covered with unthreatening but still annoying spawns.Finally, there's side balance. As is the case with any game that has 17 truly unique sides it's a nightmare. Necromancer's can be unstoppable in the Fallen Empire period, or they can get screwed by their early game position. Playing a side that relies on mines? Hope you start near some, because while your capital normally counts as one, there might not be any others nearby."

The factions are very different, but the ugly, automatic combat really drags down the game. You have NO control over combat. You don't even get to choose a basic strategy for the combat, like in King of Dragon Pass. And big fights can involve HUNDREDS of individual units! You can fast forward the fight or even just skip to the end, but it's jarring to be just presented with the end result (""Wait, how did Bob the Sorceror die???""). There isn't even a combat results screen listing deaths and injuries. About injuries - have you read the funny review for this game by the guy who was using goblin archers, and they all died except for one, who turned out to be missing all his shots because he was blind in both eyes? That's a funny story, but it's a HUGE nuisance that the game doesn't indicate that a unit has been crippled unless you manually check EACH one. (The developers are planning to add tactical combat to the next game in the series, but the early screenshots show that it's still an ugly mess with too many units).Resource management is also a pain, because there are WAY TOO MANY resource nodes. This is especially bad with classes such as the Troll King that can and should control EVERY SINGLE FOREST TILE, but every class has to capture tons of tiny little villages and such to get a coin or two of income. And because there's tons of random wildlife running around, you need to either leave a decent number of units behind at each resource node, or a rampaging deer will somehow ""conquer"" the town and make them stop sending tribute, so you'll have to send someone to RE-conquer it.I can deal with the graphics being worse than games from 20 years ago, but I can't tolerate that the GAMEPLAY is worse than ancient games like Master of Magic.The guys who make this game are like the Wachowskis - they've got some really great ideas, but they desperately need an editor, which in this case means selling out to a company who uses their creativity but doesn't tolerate bloated game design."

Made by the developers of Domnions, it's a different take on the genre from the Dominions series or anything else out there.  It is faster paced and more about combat than most games of this type.You choose from a roster of unique leaders (from Necromancers to Troll Kings to the CoE equivalent of Hobbits), and start on a single fortress unique to your leader.  You can capture farms, towns, cities, fortresses, and magical sites.  Each turn is a month and the seasons matter - winter will slow your troops to a crawl and cut your income.  Combat is non-interactive - you can set the spells you want your casters to draw from before battle but that's about it.  There is no diplomacy - everyone is at war unless they are on your team from the start.  The interface is quite intuitive and right-clicking on just about anything will bring up an explanation.The best part of this game is how uniquely each of the 18 leader classes plays.  They each have different magical resource requirements, spells, units, methods of recruiting units and progression paths.  For instance, as a Demonologist, you will need people to sacrifice to summon demons and upgrade your casters.  That makes controlling towns and cities important.  In contrast, the Witch powers her summoning spells and upgrades from fungi gathered in forests and swamps - settlements are far less important to her.  I think this is absolutely brilliant game design and the most fun in the game is had by learning each class and struggling to stay alive in the first 50 turns while fighting neutrals and other computer players.The game is not without its flaws and frustrations.  The graphics are charming but primitive.  The lack of control over combat can be frustrating - you can lose battles you should win because your idiot spellcasters won't pick the correct spell.  It is difficult to hold territory because your captured settlements don't generate any militia (except for a few leader classes).  You can and do often lose a key city or mine to a rampaging group of 3 small snakes.   The map generator tends to make somewhat wonky maps - each terrain tile seems to be independent of its neighbors so you are unlikely to see a large forest or mountain range.  Instead you'll find randomly clumped tiles that don't look like realistic geography.  And after you've survived the difficult but enjoyable early game, the mid and late game tend to drag on.  It's too bad you can't develop any of the settlements or fortresses (or even build roads to quicken the horrendously slow pace of your armies).  That might add an empire building aspect to the game that would keep it interesting beyond the first 50 turns.  More rituals for each class would also be nice.  As it stands, most classes basically have a weak summon, medium summon, and strong summon spell.  Rituals affecting the world would add a lot to the game.  For instance, if I could blast those aforementioned 3 snakes with a fireball or cast the world into eternal darkness, the mid and late-game would be a lot more fun.   Let's hope CoE 4 adds more depth to the mid and late game.However, as it stands the game's advantages heavily outweigh its shortcomings.  I found it to be a breath of fresh air and greatly enjoyed playing a game with each of the 18 leader classes.  If you like fantasy TBS games and are not turned off by the primitive graphics, you'll find it to be a treat."

Would a deer wandering into a village really bring production to a halt???I'd recommend ""lairs"", where a large concentration of one type of creature lives and which spawns mobs until cleared out. That way you could use these animals strategically - clear them out if you don't want them, or leave them active between you and your enemy so that he'll have to go through a bunch of moose or whatever to get to you."

First let me start off by saying, this game was NOT rushed in the development.  The developer accomplished a completely functional game that pulls off the hybrid mix of Turn-based strategy games like Civilization (very much like the original Sid Meir's Civilization), and many of your favorite old school role-playing games, without redundant menus, complicated interfaces and pointless cosmetic displays.  It's a simple game, that somehow manages to get it all right, perfectly!  Everything you need to know is right on the main window, or a couple of right and left mouse clicks away.  The factions are incredibly diverse, not like most games today, which is merely a ""re-skinning"" of a generic faction, but each faction seemlessly plays by its own ""logical"" rules in a fantasy world.  It plays like an adventure, set in a strategy fantasy world of conquest.   Non-linear, journey, exploring a constantly evolving world, and shaping it to your own character's specialized needs and strengths.  And the modding opportunities..."

I don't mind the retro style of programming and gaming, but the content should be contemporary, the mechanics should be modern.  I found the controls in this game to be unnecessarily clunky and burdensome.  I couldn't easily figure out how to check the statuses of various units and really couldn't understand.  The animations didn't just look old school  -- they WERE OLD.  Again, it seems as though I'm splitting hairs by saying this, but  there are plenthy of retro games out there that truly are innovative and cutting edge in the content they provide.One way I could express my experience with this game -- I always felt as though I was on the cusp of an enjoyable experience.  At times, I almost began enjoying what I was playing.  Almost.

This game is 10.99$ and let me tell you, this game is basically the overlord of strategy games; people always cry and moan and say ''boohoo I'm a little child, civilzation is the only good strategy game out there.''. You know what I say, I say screw those kids man, Conquest of elysium is the way to go if you aren't some meta slave underage pimple faced lesion upon the behind of the unholy dark king satan himself.Summary of the game: You play as some random race—well not exactly random, there are like nine thousand races to choose from— and the goal is simple, YOU CONQUER ELYSIUM, SIMPLE? IS IT NOT. HEHEHEHAHAHA. YEEHAW PARTNER. SEE YOU LATER ALIGATOR, IN A WHILE CROCODILE, THAT'S ALL SHE WROTE.Intermission: I wish there was a race that let me enslave other races and use their grinded up bones as some sort of gasoline fuel hybrid to power my war machines, but that aside, yes I do like Ice cream.The big cheese: It's very much a point and click game, but there is some depth to it. It is as they say, easy to play but difficult to master. You can have very much fun in this lovely game while being blissfully ingnorant to it's contents. Or you can really go deep into and penetrate the thin haze of confusion that is a new strategy game and really learn how to play this masterpiece.

At bargin price up to 7 dollars, (or full price if you go by the dollar per hour thing), it's a steal."

Not bad for a bit of a play around and certainly occupied my time pleasantly, but as I say - very limited - as it is, I would recommend the game, but don't break the bank over it"

To get to the point, I think it is definitely worth it, but not if it's for full price at $10. This game seems simple and dated at first, which is partially true. The interface isn't advanced at all, but it does give the game an overall classic vibe. Conquest of Elysium is a multifaceted game, with many different playstyles. There are truly numerous possibilities when playing this game, and if you like the genre, then I highly recomend it."

They have become more micromanaged, and these complexicites have provided more immerisive levels of game play.  However Conquest of Elysium 3 provides a simplified experience that is great in its own way.  Each class of hero (from which there are 16) the player has to choose from has a very different style of gameplay from the other classes.  This includes classes that are seeming similar, however you will find each play through, according to the class will be very different according to what could seem to be small nuiances.  If random maps and events are your thing there is no shortage here (not to mention moding options that can increase the factions and randomness).  Other than that you pick units to purchase with gold, and according to your class your unique resource (herbs, Sacrifices, Crystals; etc.) that allow you to purchase unique units or spells.  Combat is automatic; the only control you have is spells memorized by casters and the units entering the battle.  This is a great game and I caught it on a steam sale for a couple bucks, and I definitely recommend Conquest of Elysium 3 without reservations."

There is a map populated by a variety of strategic locations such as towns, farms, etc; and you roam around with your heroes and their armies, and conquer the world.There are something like 10 factions, hundreds of units, all kinds of spells and items, and everything else such a game should have. The gameplay is simple, quick, and fun.+ Relatively quick - you can finish a game in 2-3 hours.+ Complete - there is plenty of content.+ Reasonably balanced.+ Stable - I had no crashes.- Freezing lakes are a nasty trap for new players.= No other negatives, really; the game delivers what it promises. The graphics are nothing to shout about, but they do their job.9/10, excellent TBS, recommended."

It is all there - a customizable, randomly generated game world filled with interesting places scattered throughout a vast wilderness to explore; armies formed of a myriad of different creatures, led by powerful commanders; game mechanics straightforward enough to grasp for new players, yet hiding remarkable depth. Graphics are simple but completely adequate - again, contributing to the board game feel. Duly described as a ""fantasy roguelike"", Conquest of Elysium 3 plays quick and is great fun: with all its lovely details, it sparks the player's imagination and creates an immersion not often experienced. Give it a spin - it is well worth your time."

After I have learned to control my units, I have beaten up my 2 enemies which were 2 difficulty. There are maybe 10 difficulties. I tried the easy first to see what it does.You will get a leader and a town who can lead some units. In the beginning you have one farm or resource which gives you +1 gold. Accumulated gold is used for units. There are some special units offers during some months. Each turn is one month. The world changes depending on the seasons.During gameplay I got one special leader who was useful mage.Battles are simulations on screen, each unit takes its turn, you can speed it up or skip the battle.There are running creatures in the world which are neutral and can attack you as well as enemies.You can see by right-clicking on them what stats they have. If you remember old M&M right-clicking on opponents, it also stops the game during combat, but you can see all their abilities, buffs and damage.There are some hidden units and you uncover the world from fog of war.By losing your leader or killing the enemy leader, you eliminate the faction. Units, if not leaders, can not move on their own. They must be transfered to leaders. Otherwise they only defend current tile.Leaders can move from 1 to 3 tiles, maybe more...So far I like the game, it is a little challenging, you must accumulate enough units to defeat some enemies, but hard to say if it is challenging on higher difficulties as I only played the easy.Yeah, and graphics are not so good as you can see, units do a little animation and it has some music in background, sounds in battle are ridiculous. Overally, game is well-focused on tactics."
