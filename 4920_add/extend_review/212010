The graphics are good, combat is okay, and there's a fair variety of missions. I cannot recommend it, however, because the game was functionally abandoned by its creator. GOF2 started as a tablet game, and like many such games, the best and most interesting parts are available as DLC. But Fishlabs only ported the core game to Windows, and they've made it crystal clear that nothing more is forthcoming because the Windows port ""didn't make enough money"" to bother supporting any further. For what I paid, I assumed that content was already included, and after finding out that it's not only not included, but it will *never* be available, I feel ripped off. There is no way this game is worth anywhere close to the asking price. Fishlabs Entertainment doesn't deserve your money because they don't support and stand behind their products."

I originally baught it on sale for around $2 to $5 (US).   Because of the way I play games, usually not straight through, I have put 75+ hours on it by exploring every planet in every solar system available.  By the way, there are around 100+ planets. Galaxy on Fire 2 HD (GoF2) is with out question a good time killer, not very tasking, relaxing game.So, why the thumbs down?  Well, GoF2 was ported to the PC from the tablet/phone platform.  Personally, that is NOT a problem.  [1] However, the game storyline is VERY SHORT.  It is really easy to complete the story portion quickly.  When the game is done, you can continue to play by wandering aimlessly and doing the same basic odd jobs while jumping across the galaxy, accomplishing nothing. [2] The game is incomplete.  There are DLCs for the game that have more ships and weapons but, the PC platform version is not worth the DEVs time and effort to support.  [3]  This game is NOT worth more than $2.00 (US), in my opinion, if the DEVs are going to abandon it. Reference...https://steamcommunity.com/app/212010/discussions/0/846941710366069187/In short (I know, too late!), if you have to buy this for PC, do NOT pay full price.  If this is what the Devs, ""The Fishlab Team"", thinks of its' customers, I highly suggest you rethink buying ANY of their games.  Your money, your call!"

You will not have access to most of the great gear and interesting places you would find on mobiles.  Even that gear which *is* present in shops, though, is not something you will have access to if you follow the paper-thin plot - you will have to grind for many hours to afford it.  Even worse is that there are a few pieces of uberstoff in the game which you can only get by crafting it from blueprints, which you can only get at vanishingly infrequent occasions.Honestly, if this kind of game suits you (it does me), you are more likely to have fun playing Starpoint Gemini 2.

The story and dialog is pretty weak, but there's still enough here for a few hours of fun.While there are side missions, they consist of just a few ""canned"" missions like transport, attack pirates, trading goods, escort, etc. They're a quick way to make money and don't add to the story. There are a few npc's that will sell you charts to ""hidden"" systems or special items.For a game that tends to focus on trading, they didn't make it very intuitive. There's no way to store goods, so you either have to get a ship with LOTS of cargo space, or just sell anything you get right away. There's also no economy map. You can look at the highest\lowest known prices for each item; but prices change a lot, and so you have to constantly check which turns into a click-fest. If they just added an economy map all this could be remedied.AI is mediocre, usually the only challenge is being outnumbered 10-1. Fighting a couple ships at a time usually isn't a challenge once you get some better weapons and items. But watching AI battle each other can be painful.Graphics look decen't, but for some reason the background stars look blurry and washed out. Planets and special fx look really sharp and crisp, overall they get the job done.I'd highly recommend a controller, and to get the game on sale ($20 seems a little steep).5\10"

The combat itself is very simplistic and lacks depth/proper dogfighting. Enemies just charge straight at you and it's up to your gear and basic movement to decide the fight. It's obviously the result of this being a mobile port, but it takes away much of the potential fun and makes the game boring pretty fast, especially with side messions seriously lacking in variety and having a very predictable progression curve.2. The DLC that was released for iOS and gave the game some cool high-end modules and new objectives will never come to PC, making this to some extent an unfinished product.While I had some fun with this game, it's not really worth your time.

This might be a bitter decision, but it is a business decision we have to do as a independent development studio as well.

Took me 37 slow and semi-afk hours to collect every single achievement in this game, and most of them are a bit grindy, especially to visit exactly 100 of the game's 100 total stations. I did that while at work, and nobody even noticed I was gaming on my tablet pc (Dell Venue 8 Pro) because it was that uneventful. Of my time playing, a very small percentage of it was spent advancing the plot, and most of it being achievement-conscious and thoroughly visiting every station as I moved around the map and took on select non-story missions as they were offered. My method actually ended up quite well aligning with finishing top-equipment blueprints and having enough money to acquire an end-game hull right when the story completion wrapped up the checklist of gold medals still missing.I played through it all with a mouse. It was doable, but a whole line of ship upgrades, namely -maneuvering thrusters-, were completely useless because they only made it harder to keep the darn ship going where you want it to.Combat amounted to this order of events: Approach an enemy, they are already approaching you. See incoming fire that cannot really be dodged because all the ships you drive are sluggish (they do all have fast pitch/yaw control but are drifty with high inertia and low top speed). When you're close enough to start dishing your weapons out, you do, and the enemy and you neither fail to dodge this first volley. Then you pass by one another, and the enemy never fights back after that because all you have to do is make your 180 degree turn and then keep the enemy on your screen and he'll never get another attack angle on you. Some weapons auto-aim, which is frustrating when they lock on to something other than your intended target, flagging you as a traitor to friendlies. The only way combat in this game becomes hard is when there are potentially over a dozen ships all coming at you this same way.The game has [supposedly] more depth after DLC, better controls, and is generally just more appropriate on the iphone or android as a mobile game."

The ships don’t handle well, the controls are fixed to one uncomfortable mode, and it costs way too much for a game that works better on a cell phone.  Get the mobile version—this one isn’t up to par.I'm also not thrilled with the fact that there is almost no support from the company for the PC verson.  I don't think they've updated since a few months after the release."

I do believe this PC port was a last try to save the game but it seems like the game itself is no longer supported. Nonetheless, the game is still worth 20$ as you can easily spend a good 20 hours on this game and still feel the need to continue. The graphics were astonishing for a game back in 2011 and I still believe they are quite amazing in full HD nowadays. The story is easy to pick up and also easy to interrupt to do some side missions or make some money. The trading system while being limited is quite decent and you could easily make some money with it.Overall, this game would be a thousand times better with steam workshop and it would probably give the game a new start.Tl;dr : Buy the game if you enjoy playing space sims without having to spend 30000 hours in a crappy ship or grinding mats all day everyday."

That also marks the biggest flaw: The mobile variants have expansion packs, DLCs and ingame-shops, all of wich are missing completely from the Steam version, so you really buy half of the game.Another small flaw is the fact that you cannot lock-in a target lock, and also cannot except friendly units from being locked. Add to that the fact friendly targets are far easier to lock (i.e. in a quite bigger radius around the targeting reticle) and the property of any homing projectile to switch instantly to your current lock, and all homing weapons have something of a problem with friendly fire.If you can stand those small flaws though, it is all in all an enjoyable nugget for the casual game in between."

Definitely doesn't match the nostalgic brilliance of Freelancer.The visuals are as expected for a space sim, with beautiful planetary vistas and nebulae abundant.

Also there are issues with the  controller support. when exiting a space station or switching in and out of Auto pilot your controller may stop functioning...sometimes temporarilly  (20 sec) sometime you have to restart the game. Also i have had it crash a couple of time right after this has happened. In any case if you can get it for 5.00 like i did it is well worth that price and i am enjoying the game.

The standard price is $20, 4x the cost of both DLC's on the mobile game (excluding quick access to Kaamo).Currently, if Fishlabs (the devolpers) were to have some sort of massive problem and shut down all work on the PC version, I would go with the mobile version.  However, I don't see these guys pulling something like that, so I'm guessing they're working vigerously to port the DLC's over to us having the DLC's more than tripples the playtime.TLDR:  No, this is not $20 worth right now, but there's more to come and it is worth the sale price of $5"

Also liked that once the story is over, you can actually spend time exploring.Unfortunately, fairly boring and unengaging story. Lots of grinding to get decent gear. The usual ""we don't care if it's a space game, we're going to pretend we never heard of Newtonian physics"", but I'm getting used to the lack of phoques game developers give.It was vaguely amusing. But not great. Still, probably worth $2-$5 or so.Pet peeve: automatic targetting system. If you want to fire a guided weapon at an enemy (say, to not run the risk of hitting a friendly during a furball), you have to let the automatic system lock on. Unfortunately, if there's a friendly anywhere NEAR the enemy, even nowhere near the targetting circle, the system will lock on to the friendly, not the enemy. Even if the friendly is behind the enemy. Which is very annoying.  Also, if you try to use the automatic targetting system to lock onto the station (for docking), it's just as likely to lock onto an asteroid BEHIND the station.Other pet peeve: (slight spoiler)Other pet peeve: if you're anywhere NEAR the freighter, even behind it, when it's going through the worm hole you'll end up pulled in ahead of it and it's game over."

There are some parts of the game that are mediocre such as the graphics, which are dated and a bit glitchy.  The interface is useable, but not that good either, ie control icons on the screen are set too wide apart, which might be ideal for a phone but not for a 32"" screen!  The HD is good, but the graphics are jumpy and fractured at times; I'm running a top end system with a gtx 1080, so I'd expect smooth movement and graphics not tearing of the render on screen.Okay now the good points, the story is very retro (which I love) all-in-all good fun to follow, and has kept me interested.  I wish more games had decent stories....  I like the ships and upgarding system too; these are fairly stock for a game of this genre, but it adds a feeling of customsation, which players of this genre will enjoy.  I can't say I've seen much point in trading so far...  Mining is okay too, but slow going.  The freelance missions will help with your cash flow problems.

If you are familiar with the genreANDplayed Eve:Online a decent amount time, then Galaxy on Fire 2 willNOTadd anything groundbreaking or new to your previous experience and may even disappoint you because of its lack of complexity.tl;dr :Galaxy on Fire 2 is basically an Eve:""Offline"" with trainingwheels and without the importance of keybindings, less content and depth to get completely lost. Recommended for genre beginner and during a sale. One of the better mobile ports.Where to begin... the cons of course! :- the dialog is cheesy  (some lines are just ... *blergh*)- voiceacting is subpar  (mostly emotionless voiceacting reduced to a simple ""Read the lines and be done with it!"")- the story is cliché (good guy vs bad guys, good guy saves the galaxy and gets the grill, happy end)- integration of  the world is only an absolute minimum  (thus 80% of the world stays unexplored)- no motivation to do anything except the main story line  (tasks to keep you busy with low rewards)- no replayability  (even if you farm the very best ship with the very best equipment, the enemys do not scale with you)And now to the pros! :- a splendid port  (pretty textures,FXs and controls)- overall gameplay is acceptable  (aiming is a little off, hitboxes are too big for some objects)- a simpler version of Eve:Online and a good start into the genre  (simple mechanics, mostly explained)- you get your moneys worth of gameplay  (especially when you get this on sale)If you make the decision to purchase this game, finish it and it is to your liking, I'd recommend you test out the trial version of Eve:Online. There you can get a more in depth look at how complex the games of this genre can be. You will be overwhelmed by the sheer amount of information but if you preservere and get the hang of it, you will find joy in this genre./me shamelessly promotes Eve:Online even though he doesn't play it himself."

The controls are a little wonky at first - I recommend keyboard & mouse - and I miss the lack of an in-cockpit viewpoint, but the ships, stations, and other objects are beautifully rendered.  The plot isn't the most original ever devised, and the alien races could use a little more fleshing out IMO, but that doesn't detract greatly from my enjoyment of the game.

Targeting a planet for a jump while in an asteroid belt may prove a pain in the A as crosshair tend to lock nearest asteroid instead of a planet. The biggest dissapointment, of course, is that PC version of this game lacks both DLC's, which are otherwise available on consoles.This game provides several hours of enjoyable gameplay, but considering the PC version I would recommend to hold your money until it's available at a discount (which was the reason I originally bought it)."

Wouldnt recommend buying this on PC due to not having any of the DLC options that come with the Ipad version. Really disappointed about that. Other than that its a decent game, but i wont recommend it."
,Not Recommended,212010,14911257,"Posted: 15 March, 2015",all,TRR Vegeto247,"I find this game to be nothing more than a distraction. It's a mobile/tablet port that's just better off staying on that platform because the control interface suits it well than a mouse or joystick. I was really looking forward to another flight sim that has joystick capabilities. It works but it doesn't feel exactly right.What I didn't like about this game were the terrible reverse physics logic, voice acting, the characters, side missions on REPEAT just to continue to raise money, and Mission 11. What I mean when I say ""reverse physics logic"" is the sad idea that certain objects are not approachable and others are. If you approach a capital ship or a space station and you're too close it will auto redirect your flight path or simply PUSH you in another direction. Whereas, if you're NEAR an asteroid in passing, then it randomly explodes just because you're near it and you haven't really come in contact with it. It's terrible. Also, there's no such thing as collision with OTHER space craft! The voice acting and characters feel phoned in and hammy. As stated before, the side missions are only there to raise money and maybe raise your tech level but there's only a few types as they're constantly RECYCLED missions. Endlessly there to provide work for you so you can raise millions of dollars for the ships and equipment you'll use. Mission 11 is quite possibly the worst mission in this game because it revolves around mining. Anyone who's played this mission will say I'm whining because I suck yet something tells me they only had to deal with TWO enemy space craft whereas I had to fight against SIX. With superiror ships like the Veteran and Anaan (granted not THE best ship compared to others), I still got destroyed countless times trying to complete the most boring aspect of this game.What I liked about this game is simple. It looks great visually with all the graphics and designs along with the variety of space craft to offer. With each space craft, they have their own unique stats and equipment slots you can customize with. That's it. Pretty game with many space craft options and the abilities.I only recommend this when it goes on sale. If you feel like you wasted your money, even then, I can understand. See for yourself and come up with your own opinion."

Unfortunatly, the ""player"" station which is part of one of the expansions will never be available for this version which was a big part of the game for me.  With out extra personal goals to be achieved, the main storyline falls very flat and the expansions introduced some much needed side lines and post scenario content to work on.  I would heartily not recommend this game."

I hate when they leave out DLCs. This game is plain without it. And after a while boring. They need to bring back making NHL games on PC . Etc etc Someone out there if there smart would make alot of money if they did. Too bad i didnt have a company otherwise id make all sorts of PC games including NHL hockey and other things on PC. Sad to see when PC users get stiffed all the time. Ok game but could of been alot better with the DLCs

If you are going to immitate someone, immitate a master. It's not Freelancer, it's not as good or as interesting, but on it's own merits the game is pretty damn good anyway. There is decent ship variety, decent weapon variety, decent amount of locations, decent amount of trade to do. Basically - it's a decent game. It lacks in interesting side-missions, but overall - I have no complaints. The controlls are tight, the fights feel like you're fighting in space and the skyboxes are pretty. I'd buy it. And I did. And maybe you should too, if you like space sims that aren't focused on trade."

WTF?I found this game on the app store and played it obsessively on the iPad and have played it a little on the PC finding both games to be one in the same. Though the naff voice acting and throw-away storyline sounds like a real downer it actually adds the the retro and fun theme of the game. Its not a AAA title by any means but its one you could throw away a few precious hours just trying to find rare items so you can build that blueprint top end shield you bought from some dodgey trader in a bar on the other side of the system. Dog fights are fun and engaging and the controls are really easy to pick up in a second.I give this game a 7.5/10

That's the sum of what I feel about Galaxy on Fire 2. It's a better looking version of the much beloved Freelancer without the interesting story, characters, and overall sense immersion.As someone who likes space sims to a certain capacity, I liked playing this game on my first gen Nexus 7 tablet as a freebie. Like I said, it looks pretty, at least it sold me on Tegra 3 at the time. Plenty of well designed ships that can be outfitted with various weapons and equipment to choose from, and I thought it played well enough given that the touch controls didn't give me carpal tunnel during combat. It's a good, probably even a great game on the mobile platforms. But the standards on PC are a bit higher and I can't say that this game measures up.$20 is asking a bit too much considering the other options out there. I got my copy for $7 during a random sale, which I'll say is a good point of entry for a space sim that looks and plays well but lacks the depth of what other games of the genre can offer. But still, like the X games are way too complicated for me to get into, GoF2 is a little too simplistic."
