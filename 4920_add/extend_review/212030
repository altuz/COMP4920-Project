,Recommended,212030,11768396,"Posted: 18 August, 2014",all,Soldiershak,"This game is a very challenging game, the diffiulty may push players away, but it is also a very fun game once you get the hang of it. This game is not for those who like having ""the victory"" given to them.Here's some quick gameplay notes:Each enemy has something unique that requires a different approach.Levels have unique setups enemy setups and conditions, so the game never feels stale.Animations are well done. The staff wielding enemies are a prime example.Attacking an enemy is very satisfying because of the way they react to it.There are various power ups, attacks, abilities, and items that can be unlocked. One ability that you should focus on getting is Air Guard.The game supports local co-op (the entire campaign) via gamepad and KB. Both Xinput and Direct Input gamepads are supported (you'll have to configure Direct Input gamepads through the buggy config.exe. Xinput works by default). The game is difficult enough for you to ""take turns"" with 2 or more friends around.The combat is not broken as some say and the game does not break its own rules; the only attacks that are unblockable are ones with exclamation marks, it does not depend on the enemy using chi attacks (I do not recall the game ever saying that chi attacks are unblockable) there can be a combination of chi attacks and unblockable attacks which are indicated by an exclamation point.You have to use common sense when fighting some enemies. You can generally tell if an attack will cause you to stagger should you attempt to guard against it. Some enemies will try to land successive hits. Your first block requires less precision; subsequent blocks require greater precision. You can dodge/block mid-combo.The game's graphics remind me of the newer Street Fighter games and another game called Power Stone 2 (I'd love to see that on Steam some day).All in all the game is fun if you like a challenge, you'll have fun retrying over and over again by yourself or with a friend, if you know how to laugh at yourself."

It's frustrating and fun, and the gameplay is very satisfying. Playing this reminded me of the videogames I played as a kid: You will die. A lot. You will continously try to beat the same boss for an hour and when you finally do, you'll cheer. Some of the enemies fight extremely dirty, and there will come a point where you will all but have to look up combos and strategies to advance, but it's worth it. For $10, it's a lot of fun!"

I ended up getting, for the most part, rank Ds on Easy/Normal difficulties.Later levels seem almost impossible playing on singleplayer (THIS GAME IS MEANT TO BE PLAYED WITH SOMEONE ELSE).Sometimes the enemies get overwhelming, so you HAVE to get rid of them quickly.I luckily got this game for just $1, so in my opinion for that price is well worth it. I'd say for half the price or less this game is well worth it if you are into challenging games."
,Not Recommended,212030,14817842,"Posted: 9 March, 2015",all,Trappola,"Kung Fu Strike has great potential, but it's terribly unfair and unforgiving.Game is hard, but not extremely hard and it's quite enjoyable learning to master all moves, how to block and to evade, but eventually, at later stages, it becomes unfair and AI seems to get always the upper hand.A typical example is when enemies start performing special attacks repeatedly (while you have to accumulate KI for special moves) and start to gangbang main character with red attacks while still knocked down from previous attacks, leaving zero chance to block/escape and leading often to a premature death.From my point of view game has not been balanced very well and in some stages (or some bonus challenges) it leads to the frustrating sensation that you have to repeat the same stage several times, before winning for pure luck or because AI says so.This is the biggest flaw for which I don't feel to recommend this game and it's a pity because it is great for everything else:- game is very enjoyable to play before enemies become overpowered- graphic is beautiful, coloured and clean- there are different levels to play, each with its own style- local co-op- main character can be upgraded via new moves or items purchased- new moves are not just a cosmetic upgrade, but opens new fighting tactics- xbox controller is supported"

76561197999416373,Recommended,212030,29775504,Posted: 7 February,all,Daniel Powell,"I absolutely LOVE this game.Is it very deep? Not terribly so. Is there a huge amount of content? Eh, not really. Are all levels fun? Definitely not (bomb levels in specific). But, if the stars align, this is one of the most silly fun games i've ever played.The Swordsman is the absolute pinnacle of my enjoyment. I went from getting absolutely demolished the first 40-50 times, to being able to beat him with no health on the hardest difficulty. You will realize his script. You will know what he is doing, when, and how. And then you will beat him in your sleep. And you would think this is a bad thing, but it really isn't. Because you actually feel skillful when you get to that point. It won't be frustrating. It won't feel cheap.And the sheer number of moves and combo's that you have are ridiculous. Press X 4 times slowly and you'll get a powerful high damage slam combo. Press x 4 times and hit a twice and you'll get an aerial kick to follow it. Hold x and you will have a huge flurry of punches. Mix and match high's/ lows and you will get some new combos. And once you know all of them, how to do them, and can do them reliably, the game will go from impossible, to you giving the asking hand to the enemies, saying ""Bring it"".I look forward to any more content from these developers, and truly want to thank them for this incredibly fun game.2/21/2017-I'm a few more hours in at this point (by few I mean more than a few), and I want to reiterate how much fun, how much raw enjoyment I get from this game. I'm more of an ARPG fan, so to get such a fresh new lease on this genre after none of the other major AAA titles did anything for me has really broadened my scope of interest.When you first play this game, the sheer complexity can be overwhelming. This game doesn't cater to desperation combo's, and those will get you killed fast. You have to make all of your actions deliberate. The enemy AI is calibrated extremely well. So well, that even when you know their script,  it is still difficult. Grunts will rarely try to initiate attacks, but the moment you attack them, others will sieze a chance to strike. You cannot use the same combo or strategy everywhere.The animations are some of the best quality i've seen in a game, easily comparable to the biggest names.I've learned to time my attacks so that it's a fluid string of strikes, with very little delay between both. When I spin kick, I wait til my feet touch the ground before I keep going, I've learned to hit block if you've made an attack near a group. I can beat every boss (well, a few still destroy me, namely the final story mission bosses). I have played this for entire days, only to end up playing more the next.I have a couple of complaints, but they're so small, that the only one worth even mentioning is the lack of online matches. But that's more of a desire than it is a fault.And do you want to know the best part? The absolute best part of this game? When I think i've learned everything there is to offense, I always end up proving myself wrong with new tricks.I hope the developers make a sequel, because I would buy it in an instant.

76561197978525241,Recommended,212030,13709000,"Posted: 30 December, 2014",all,FreakeR,"Not a walk in the park, but even better than the Arkham series if you master everything and I LOVE the Arkham games (check my vids). This is not for the weak-willed. You must be Contra/Dark Souls experienced when coming into this. Definitely needs an online coop option. Mostly goes on sale for $2.50 (As of 2017 I've seen it for $.99). Overall underrated and it seems the company's webpage disappeared recently so we may not see a sequel :(Pros:There is a demo. If you enjoy the demo the game is 10x better. If not, no money wasted!The skill cap is very high in this game. As you unlock combos you can mix and match for really really fun results.Upgrades and items change the game significantly so strategy is enforced over button mashing as the game progresses.Load times are very fast. Any gold you earn is instantly saved whether you lose or quit the room (use this fact to farm). This game is best played in spurts which it does well especially if you get frustratedThe Music: check profile for complete soundtrack videoCons (with some upsides):Some levels are outright masochistic (poison ones especially). They're not impossible, but man these stages will make you want to to quit. Get through them and you'll get 10x better at the game though.The Learning curve for mechanics is steep. Examples: Sometimes you want to deflect and roll but end up doing a sweep. A few chi moves share similar commands so you will be autocorrected often. Being attacked by a low and high hit at the same time is impossible to avoid unless you have a very high deflect upgrade. Some moves unlocked are paramount to survivability and enjoyment of the game. Patience is really needed, but definitely pays off.Arena limitation = Not much replayability since it isn't open world. DLC challenges are for the masochists because they're harder than the regular game, but you can truly call yourself a Master (as the dlc is named) if you can do em.Upgrades/Items are a grind. There is no guide on how you actually accumulate items other than play alot and they pop out at the end of each stage and you must unlock before you can buy. I'm 130+ hours in and still haven't unlocked everything. Everything is super expensive, but it's very satisfying when you finally unlock them.No restart options, with a game that emphasizes score and performance this is a shame, but as mentioned the game loads fast so it's a minor annoyance.Camera angles go crazy in corners and will screw you alot. There's no fix for it but you can adapt with enough practice. This is THE worst part of the game IMO"
,Not Recommended,212030,32384660,Posted: 13 June,all,SanicDaHergedog,"I think this is a great game... well for the first hour. If you see a review with 0.5 hours or something? Disregard it really, it's not gonna tell you anything about the later game which posesses the issues to make it a not recommended.Controls:X is ground attack.A is air attack.X+A is a chi attack.These work well, although X and A don't allow you to do any special combos, the chi attacks make up for it allowing you to buy multiple chi attacks that are activated through stuff like X+A, X then X+A, X+A mid air twice then X on the ground, ect. It's also nice to just mash A and X to go to town on the enemy without thinking too hard about combos.RT is dodgeB and LT is deflectOne of these is the biggest issue with the game but i'll focus on it later. Dodging is as it sounds, you roll away quickly in the direction you chose then you move about twice as fast for a second afterwards. After this you go back to normal speed. Now to deflect which is a mechanic that allows you to be invincible for a second, and in that second any enemy that attacks you has their attack negatated and is knocked down. There are a few exceptions for how deflect works as some enemies still continue hitting you after you deflect your first attack (with no warning), and some don't even care and will hit through your deflect if they have an ! appear before they attack.Now to the issues with this otherwise great beat'em up game. This is a review that needs a neutral option as if you look past it's issues, there is a lot of really fun parts to this game that I wish more people could enjoy.Issues:Lets start with one mechanic in this game where you hold X against an enemy when prompted too, and then press A to finish it off. This is some sort of guard break on the enemy but the issue i have with it is how long the A prompt is up and how much the X prompt can vary in length. Sometimes the X prompt is almost instant and sometimes it takes a while. If it was a set length, this would work regardless of its very quick-time event feel to it. This is also shoved in your face while you're attacking an enemy too and all you can do is sigh and do this boring mechanic yet again.If you attack an enemy, other enemies will then attack you during your attack which you cannot cancel, at least to my knowledge. Usually you can get one or two hits off then run but that doesnt' work. So you have to get a few hits off and deflect the enemies, but you can't always do that until later on because of another issue right after this one. Overall this mechanic isn't bad just doesn't work with other issues in this game.You have to buy the ability to deflect in mid-air and dodge in mid-air which is really ♥♥♥♥ing stupid. This is absolutely nessecary to the game later on and even in earlier levels. So if you do any air attacks, you're wide open until you get either one of these. This issue applies to guard breaks as to finish one off, you press A... an air attack.Your brief speed-boost after dodging will end without just going to your way too slow normal walking speed, it will automatically make you do a FULL STOP wherever you are for half a second. Why is this a thing? Why don't i just go into normal ground speed, why do i have to go from roll to running to ♥♥♥♥ing stopped without me pressing a button. It's terrible, the only way to avoid this is to keep on rolling and attack an enemy before the stop happens which is annoying and is harder to focus on than you think due to the other issues all hitting you at once.And now the mother of all issues with this game, deflecting. This son of a ♥♥♥♥♥ doesn't work. It's not that you can't deflect, no you can easily deflect. It's that if 2 enemies attack you, which is very frequent. More often than not, they will attack you so you can only deflect ONE of them while the other will hit you no matter what. This is terrible. The ganking of the enemies ruins this feature so much as if one enemy hits you, usually 2 or 3 more will start to attack. You attack one enemy and then the enemies approach you, deflect to counter them and woopse either 1, the enemy you were hitting suddenly breaks the stun lock you put him in for no ♥♥♥♥ing reason and hits you almost instantly, stun locking you. 2, the enemy attacks in different intervals so you can't deflect them all. Or 3, you get lucky and only 1 or 2 enemies attack you in a way where you can deflect it. Maybe if you're extremely lucky you can just attack the enemy and the RNG doesn't decide to randomly screw you over.So many issues with this otherwise great game don't just make the side things annoying but effect the main game. I just can't recommend it. It's a blast at first, but it gets boring. Money is too hard to come by to buy new skills and items, the inconsistenties in this game are too extreme at moments, the deflect system that is pressured on you doesn't work enough with the rest of the game, and overall a giant amount of design flaws. You can tell they understand how to make something more fluid in areas like how nice the rolling is. The rolling part feels so nice, you can change direction easily with no worries. The X and A spamming also works very well. I don't know what it is about it but all the combos go how i'd think they'd go. Which makes it easier to use them. The fluidity and challenge that this game possesses isn't fully taken away. What deals the final blow between recommended and not recommended is the pricing, 10 dollars does not match this game's quality and how much content it has fully. Yes it has a lot of effort put into it and I feel bad almost for not recommending this game, but it's true. I'm usually overaly critical on games but on this one, i really think these are really bad design choices. So if it's on sale? Get it. If not, save it as this game's not a short gem. It's a game most people play for 0.5 hours then go ""Coll gaem, thums up"" and never play it again."

This game is great, I mean just playing the game and beating the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of numerous enemies feels pretty damn good, and even though they for the most part overwhelm you they can easily be dispatched by numerous chi moves and combos. Unlocking moves, replaying missions just to get the coin for said moves also is cool and even though i really do not like grinding in some games, this game does it right somehow. It's also good to note that this game is 2 players and I haven't tried it out yet but from what i've heard it's more fun than playing in single player, which is to be expected. The game is also optimized incredibly well, which is good considering the extremely limited amount of video settings they give you. The only two problems I've had concerning this game however is getting it to launch, for some reason my game whenever i press the start button will not launch although the process is still going on in task manager so that's something to keep in mind whenever buying this game, the other problem is the camera angles in the game, i've had numerous occasions where i'd be fighting a boss and the camera cuts behind a rock, limiting my view.

In the time I have played it, had I known of it's excistance, I would gladly have bought it regardless of the sale. Generic Title Brawler or Kung Fu Strike, is a beat em' up game and a rather fun one at that. In regards to story, I honestly couldn't say. I thouroghly enjoy cutscenes and delving in the lore and what not, but I had a wierd compulsion to skip all the still image cutscenes, maybe cause I play this particular game for one reason.Gameplay has you, in each level, fight in arena against a number of enemies of various strengths with a challenging boss at the end, however some levels do the cheap alternative of just putting a previous boss and their twin sibling/clone to pummel you silly. In regards to combat you have your light, heavy, jump attacks, counter, and dodge. You'll have fun pulling off flashy combos and contrary to nay-sayers, the fighting does not have a broken/ginormous learning curve. It took me awhile to realize in order to perform different, stronger moves, and proper counters, they must be executed with timing. You will only get so far mashing the attack button and your Common Martial Arts Striker will keep raving while you get attacked if you keep mashing the counter button.There's also a local co op, I haven't tried it yet (no one wants to play with me :D) but I'd like to speculate that it is just a buddy who can jump in to help you on the harder levels and harder some of these levels can be, I mean, there totally possible to beat flawlessy with concentration but the level with raining bombs? Fork that level. Overall, though, a decent brawler to pick up and play."

I enjoyed the beat 'em ups of the S/NES days, and a handful of strictly fighter titles since then from franchises such as MK, Soul Caliber, Killer Instinct, Tekken, and of course the Smash series.This game is flashy, pretty in a kind of nostalgic way, frustrating, and even rage inducing.  I've yelled out in defiance at an uncaring Game Over screen, and keyboard mashed ALL the buttons after dying for the 50th time after failing to counter ""when I was so obviously countering and blocking I'M PUSHING THE BUTTON WTFFF"" for at least the 900th time.I am still going to play this game because after putting it down for a bit and reflecting on the experience I just had, it was a lot of fun.  I felt immensely satisfied planning out a combo starting off with a successful counter or block and obliterating a huge chunk of an enemy's health bar.  The small measure of pride I gained upon working out a boss's pattern made up for the minutes of grief and frustration it took to do so, though it felt like hours.  The hours that I played though felt like I was only playing for half an hour.  Time passed oddly when I play this game.I'll need to take frequent breaks to calm down and come at it again with a clear head, but I do not regret picking Kung Fu Strike - The Warrior's Rise up."

FPS controls are cool, but sometimes I just want that direct movement control and straightforward melee fighting.This game has a pretty good fighting system too.

I did not go into this expecting much, and the mechanics, animations, and sound design are really good and solid (with minor exceptions). However, there were frequent times I found myself wrestling with a spazzy, undecisive camera that would swing around wildly or get obstructed by foreground objects. Most enemies have very boring ways of defending themselves that come with bright button prompts telling you how to break their guard, and many large enemies have attacks that are unblockable and very troublesome to evade (although the parry and super-counter systems are well-implemented and very satisfying).I would have still given this a pass, but what broke me was a level where you must fight off stone soldiers while bombs are being dropped regularly into an arena. This would be fine except that the smaller bombs always drop next to you and always explode before you have time to react. It legitimately shocks me that this level went through concept, design, builds, testing, and at any point, somebody -anybody- said ""Yes. This level is a good idea to have in our game.""The game is surprisingly high-quality otherwise, and if these issues don't dissuade you, feel free to spend your money.

Music is OK. Seems to not have technical glitch.CON: Need for repetitive trial and error, plus some luck.1. Enemies and/or level design often have ""special trait"" that requires a ""correct"" method to fight. The problem is that making ""wrong"" move usually result player getting killed rather quickly.2. More significantly, even with right strategy in mind, the number and mix of enemies rushing the player in a given level tend to result in multiple attack types (blockable+unblockable, ranged+melee...) happening simultaneously or near-simultaneously. The need for precise blocking / dodging timing often means that at least some of the attacks get through. This also tend to end fights quickly, necessitating level restart.IMHO #2 (quantity instead of quality of enemies) is by far the greatest source of difficulty. This gives me the impression that the game was designed and tested for local co-op. Even in single player mode, when backup AI characters are available fights get noticeably better."

The gameplay isn't hard like other reviews wrote, It's just bad. Some enemies use charged attacks that home in and hit you no matter how well you block or dodge, their attacks can't be interupted but yours can, while they're being attacked they can block or roll but you have to get beaten like my♥♥♥♥♥♥♥on a week day. This makes combat feel clunky and slow even though it looks flash. A very small level had too many enemies to block or dodge properly, this isn't challenging but more of an endurance test like eating month old noodles.There are these stupid purely annoying enemies that fly at you pretending to be raden shouting weird sounds constantly and throwing bombs.

It turns out; this is one of the few games I cannot recommend, even at a steep discount.The idea behind the game is a good one. Kung Fu fighting, over the top combos and bad guys to use them on, and a solid artistic style should all combine into something great and fun to play. The reality is that the execution of the idea is horrible.While there is some skill involved, the fighting is unpolished. Against some foes, blocking and deflecting works just fine. Others, particularly some of the female fighters, any attempts at blocking, deflecting, or dodging are completely ignored or are too inconstant to work with. The bad guys can change direction mid attack, catching you from an odd angle, slam you around like you are a doll, and then deftly block whatever you do to try to fight back. Levels frequently throw aggravating and painful gimmicks like exploding vases to add variety to the experience, but only accomplish making your blood pressure rise as they blast you into the air in unblockable, unbreakable combos that end up killing you without giving you a chance to recover.Had this title gotten just a little more love and attention from its developers, it would have been something great.

It's an absolute pleasure to watch, especially if you grew up on Kung Fu movies and Run Run Shaw!By taking away the need to focus on what buttons to mash as fast as possible, it allows the player to ""get in the game"" and focus on actually being a part of the action.  The game is by no means simplistic; new moves and equipment open up slowly as you master the game, which expands the game at an even pace that didn't feel too slow or too quick.Playing solo and local co-op has been a joy.

As the title itself presents u should know this a game that does the player no favors. If u wanna beat this game u got have patience/time and the decency to try all the lvls u played again and again until u master each and everyone. Only way to beat the final boss is to use your experience and potential to your fullest (only 5.5 % of those who own the game have actually manage to win all lvls!!!)But we go ahead of ourselves. Kung fu the warriors rise is a typical oldschool beat em up game. If u like cel shaded graphics and awesome non stop action this is the title for u. Be warned as i said before its extremely hard for average/casual players to get into this game much. The hard gameplay and the not so usual keyboard setting make it a very difficult game to win. U wont guess the times i  had to play over and over some lvls just to manage to pass the initial wave of enemies. But thats where its beauty lies.As u progress the game and its challenges become harder and harder, somewhere deep deep down u are getting pumped up to win just for the lol of it. I enjoyed many moments like that and lemme tell u when i finally got to win the final boss i just screamed ♥♥♥♥ yeah. One of the few that has the potential to unlock that dynamic in u. Besides that u can relive those awesome 90s/80s scenes where one man beats up hord of enemies with his kung fu ultimately becoming the ultimate badass! Dont forget the world of martial arts is a continuous evolution therefore u can unlock new moves and new gear to help u in your journey. Think u got what it takes to win? If so be ready for one heck of a trill!If u are a fan of hardcore games that test u to the limit this is the game for u. If not i strongly recommend you, not to buy it even if u like these kind of games. This title requires like The Duke said ""Balls of Steel"".

However if you try to play it with local coop, the autofocus of the AI will just make it frustratingly difficult and somewhat broken. (Unless you lower the difficulty but what kind of monster would do that.)The story is a mess of martial art stereotypes and goes from simply bad to hilariously stupid. You have the old master, the busty female assassin and of course our generic protagonist. Just skipping it might actually improve it.While there are many types of opponents, like the swordman, the kickmaster, the big guy, the backstabbing assassin and more which are quite interesting to fight against, you are stuck with the same old character who just develops very slightly over the course of the story.Like I said, it's not a bad game at all, but I can only recommend it for people who like a challenge and are not so much into co-op or storytelling.If that doesn't matter for you, then you can expect a lot of fun, fighting the often very hard boss fights and beating the different stages the game has to offer."

,Recommended,212030,11525044,"Posted: 2 August, 2014",all,Donald JoJo Trump´s 「Wonderwall」,"Kung Fu Strike is a deceptive game, that at first seems to just meet the quality you would expect from a game with a price tag that is the equivelant of a cheep subway sandwich. However, looking past the inabilty to change the resolution and it's sometimes frustrating levels, it shows excellent design in it's combat system and difficulty curve.Much like classic critical darlings such as Megaman, the game teaches you new gameplay-elements in relatively safe/easy to overcome environments, such as teaching you to kick bombs to dispatch a few groups of smaller enemies, only to end in a bossfight with a giant statue who can also prime bombs, cause chain-reactions with bombs etc.The level of frustration fluctuates. Fun levels wherein you face pole-wielding monks are offset by gauntlets in which you face 20 enemies that can either shoot you, attack you, or do an unblockable pound with an AoE that is just slightly too big for how far your dodge-move goes.It's other main issue is that it doesn't teach you two essential gameplay elements, which are critical strikes(wherein you use a (chi-)move on an enemy in the apex of it's attack), and the fact that pushing a direction twice will make you run for a short distance(which is done automatically after a dodgeroll).The actual fighting is fantastic. Taking qeues from both beat 'em ups and modern fighting games, the game involves basic attacks which you can string into launchers, parries that can be performed in-between attacks(much like Metal Gear Rising), counter-attacks which can triple your damage on hard-hitting attacks, and even wallbounces which makes positioning in the very small arenas a key element.This is complemented by an exceptional amount of enemy variety, decently artsy graphics, and a decent if generic soundtrack that changes tunes at just the right moments during enemy and boss encounters.Kung Fu Strike is an excellent beat 'em up that does itself a disservice by calling itself oldschool. It's frustration comes from unfair levels, but the fighting mechanics are rock solid, and it doesn't put the game down enough to make it not worth your time."

You have two real options, mash X or hold X, press A when you hope something will work out right. Also you have evade tied to a button that is also deflect when there are already two other buttons for deflect - because we all know that binding multiple functions to the same button that are literally polar opposite from each other in application is an excellent idea.

As you start out, the game teaches you how your Chi-attacks (or whatever the red glowing attacks are called) break enemies' Chi-attacks, for example- the further you play, the less true that becomes. Sure, they are the only attacks thatmightbreak enemies' Chi-attacks, but that does not mean that they necessarilywill, if the hitbox decides otherwise.There is, for instance, a fight where when you attack the AI, they dodge your attack and counter-attack with a Chi-attack, but it's very hard to block (pretty sure it's the most timing-crucial thing in the game I have encountered) and if you try to counter their Chi-attack with your own, it will hit them, then drop them out of it (if you did WW kicks), and then they will punish you with another Chi-attack for half your health, You are punished for countering their counter. Did I mention you fight two of them at the same time?In essence, I would only recommend this game to masochists, as it simply isn't a fair game. I still have a blast with it, but it also gets super frustrating. If you don't mind that kind of unfair design, this is a very fine & addictive game with DMC-style combo mechanics and the only other tangible flaw I could find was the camera, which can be somewhere between inconvenient and outright terrible to the extent of flying off in a wrong direction because of it.6.5/10, would buy again in a sale.P.S.: Very playable on arcade sticks, which is always a plus in my book!"

Guard breaking takes a random but always too-long amount of time, making it impossible when facing multiple enemies and of questionable use when you do manage to pull it off, as it puts vulnerable enemies outside of Loh's prohibitively short range. Physics-based encounters involving explosives demand more mobility than Loh, possessing only a cumbersome roll and no dedicated jump button to speak of, actually has. KFS's touted ""jaw dropping combos"" are nearly impossible to execute by mid game due to sheer enemy quantity, most of whom possess the ability to interrupt them on a whim. It doesn't take long for Loh's meaty arsenal to be reduced to special attacks and parries as his only valid tools, making what should be a fast-paced and energetic beat-em-up an almost purely defensive game of blocking and waiting for meters to fill. KFS describes itself as a hard game, when in fact it's merely a long one, demanding far too much time for much too little pay out when better, fairer, and indeed, more difficult games exist in the form of Godhand, Dark Souls, or even One Finger Death Punch."

Lightly strategic, and amazingly visceral combat to boot. As of this writing on 10/3/14, it's $0.99, how could it hurt to buy this?STORY TIMEWell, what an unusual situation I am in with this game: I had the 'misfortune' to play the demo on another platform (probably the 360) a long time ago, and the demo only included the first 2 acts in stage 1. I played it, deemed it a mashy beat em up with no depth, and disregarded it entirely. Come 4 or so days ago, I notice it on sale for $0.99. I decided to buy it, not entirely remembering what it was that i disliked about it.I finish the first 3 acts of stage 1, and felt the same way. Then I played the 4th act, The Swordsman. Suddenly, the game wears its true colors, and mashes me into a fine paste. Of course I get mad, decide the game was cheating, as it was indeed breaking a lot of rules it had already established. After a dozen or so tries, I win, and that should have been the end of it. But I keep playing either way.Act 2 is already off to a good start, wailing on me mercilessly, but despite the game going out of the way to break rules, it slowly dawns on me that it probably wouldn't stand a chance if it didn't. An hour of arduous play later, I beat the 2nd Stage. Now I'm hooked.VERDICTThis game is really really FUN. The demo I played so long ago did an excellent job of selling itself short. The light content the game gave me convinced me the combat was overly simplistic; not the case. The BASIC COMBOS are very unique, in that both directional inputs, timing, and the speed at which they are pressed changes your attacks. This allows for a very fluid, natural feeling attack sequence that is wildly variable based on user input, as well as highly adaptable to the enemy. The sounds they chose for some of these strikes are so viscerally satisfying, you're likely to react quite strongly at the earth shattering, bone crunching, lighting-esque chi strikes you'll be landing on the enemy.The COUNTERS/GUARD BREAKS are a neat mechanic too, it's a little cumbersome at first, because the Hold X commands are not easily understood at first, but how it works, is if the enemy is trying to do light parries, the hold X command is a rapid flurry that aims to overwhelm them and break their guard. At any time, if they can't, or wont, let their guard break, they'll go into a full guard, the jumping attack (A), is used to break their guard in this case. Depending on the enemy, you can get anywhere from a few hits to a full blown series on them. This system, I realize, is meant to punish mashing. Yes, I said it, mashing is bad in this game. Mashing some situations is damn fun, but the game demands carefully chosen attacks. A layer of, dare i say, STRATEGY. That or PATIENCE.The enemy can use your PARRY and CHI STRIKES as well. The white glow is their parry, and the red glow is the wind up of their strongest attacks. You can bait their parries with carefully placed strikes, and CRUSH their powerful attacks with your own, giving huge damage, stunning everyone in the fight, and giving that oh so wonderful thunderous crashing sound that I crave so very very much.What surprises me is this game, despite pulling so many stops on me already, still finds ways to make each new fight even more interesting than the last, new enemies, new challenges, new mechanics to learn. On top of that, every act is a small, self contained fight that is short, but exciting to play, and easy to jump into and attempt.ISSUESI daresay my BIGGEST QUALMS with this game so far are the lack of integrated settings (you have to go outside of the game to adjust your video settings), the lack of the ability to remove the letterbox that forces 16:9 ratios, even on 4:3 ratios, the lack of a quick restart option in the pause menu (Really frustrating Stage 2 boss, I'm looking at you), having to sit and wait for your body to settle before you can continue (2nd stage boss again), and unusually high costs of items.

I'm a old school gamer back on the 80's there was a game called Yie I Kung fu. Where you fought different master  easch stage and used your skill to beat them. This game has a similar feel but with a great counter system that DOES work.......The challenge is epic! I will show you real Kung Fu! Waaaaaaaa Taaaaaaaaaa!

The music is excellent and is used to signal turning points in the battles.Despite the complaints I’ve read, I find the battle system beautiful. It looks and feels like a kung-fu movie of old. The game incorporates enough basic battle moves and concepts to allow the design of true fighting strategies:  chain combo attacks, evasions, blocks, block-breakers, critical hits, critical hit breakers and henchmen summoning. All bosses obey the system, and the side that can best exploit it will be the victor.The game’s only flaw is the combination of a lack of targeting with a dynamic camera, which causes missed attacks and rage-fueled baldness."

Boss battles are epic, minion fights large and strory line fitting.Brilliant button basher, can be much more technical too if you up the difficulty and go for S Rank, unlocks are great skill additions.There is one critique i have which is the camera is sometimes horrible when fighting multiple enemies. If not for that this game would be a solid 10/10."

The storyline is rich and well-illustrated; reminds me of all those late-night Kung Fu movies I stayed up to watch as a teen.  PvP as well as coop are both also awesome to play!

Probably better with a controller, but I use keyboard just fine.- Not a button masher- Lots of unlockable moves and powerups- Hundreds of hours of replayability- Local co-op- 4 stage demo available to try out before you buyCons:- Is difficult- So many unlockable moves, and no way to know how many you have left- Not a button masher- No online playI tend to play this game in bursts where I play for days, then put it down for months. But every time I come back, it retains its charm.  This game absolutely NEEDS more recognition.Many of the negative reviews are railing against the game for ""breaking rules"" or being ""unfair"".  It is challenging, it takes practice.  But in no way is it unfair."
,Recommended,212030,1193451,"Posted: 25 July, 2012",all,ASH+Vocaholic,"Martial Arts, Beat'em up.The combat is really nice and fluid and the sometimes ridiculous combos really make you feel like a kung fu powerhouse. Playing it on a controller reminded me what it was like to have a sore finger again. The graphics are pretty subjective I guess, but I for one like the art style they chose which seems to be quite similar to SF4.Aside from that, the game suffers a lot from being what it is.. let's face it, a bad port. Not to mention that it seems this game is closed for open discussion / tech support from the developers. With just a campaign and versus mode I'm doubtful this game will have any longevity or replay value but I guess it's still a nice casual brawler game. Also the game sometimes throws some ridiculously hard bosses and enemies at your feet.. well, either that or I suck at deflecting.So I guess the pros and cons balance each other out and the relatively low pricing could make this a worthwile game for fans of the genre."

This is a great change of pace if you need a quick pickup from a slower paced game or just want to jump in for ten minutes to get your heart going and keep your senses alert.The graphics and effects are great and pay a lot to the Anime genre of film making. The shading style is excellent and the pace is very quick. Once you get used to the controls its a lot of fun.There's a system of character progression too. So you can actually upgrade your character with different skills and even equipment.I don't play it frequently or for long so don't go by my time on it. It's great for the long haul I'm sure but I like it in short doses, a few levels at a time for a change of pace. I'd recommend it for certain."

Um, well, at some time you probably going to be more mad, because the game can be so so hard at some points and you might going to spend days to farm enough money to buy skills and equipment to kick the enemies' butts.I bought this game because of the surrealistic fighting scenes which reminded me one of the asian martial arts movie. Oh boy, how I love those moves! Haha.I almost forgot some key point of the game. However you can play it alone, it's kinda fun. But, when you team up with one of your friend, you guys can play and beat bosses together which makes the game a little bit easier and more fun!

But once you coordinate your fighting, it works just fine.VS:It's challenging to fight your friends and you can be sure friendships will be destroyed.As many reviews say, the game seems unfair sometimes, but with enough practice you will eventually master it.I definetly recommend buying this game, I spent the first 10 mins laughing because I easily flung opponents in the air and beat them with a chain of combos."

The game as a dedicated, timing based (but not frustrating) parry button that allows you to easily simulate the kind of 'combo-parry-combo-break enemy's parry' choreography that you usually see in a Kung Fu movie.It also has a CO-OP campaign and upgrades, and the default difficulty is proper arcade hard, but the game is so satisfying that you'll be coming back to repeat the (short) levels just for fun. This is one of those games that mechanically is super satifying and lends itself to repeated play (just like games like Dark Messiah, Just Cause, F.E.A.R. or Tony Hawk).It's a shame that, indie game or not, games like these still fall under the radar. I usually play this listening to a music playlist and that works pretty well.This is definitely an hidden gem. Get it, you fool!"
