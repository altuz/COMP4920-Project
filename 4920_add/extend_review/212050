Puzzles are fresh and rather challenging in some cases, while 8 bit style graphics are really cool! The story conclusion should have been less rushed out, and the sound department is a bit poor, nevertheless I really liked this little gem. I recommend it to adventure fans who loved the '80s and '90s classics that want to breathe part of that atmosphere again!"

Puzzles are logical, intuitive, and require critical thinking and paying attention to your context and options, not relying on trial and error like a surprisingly large amount of classics do.If you like other games from Wadjet Eye Games like Primordia, the Blackwell series, Gemini Rue, or another, I can almost assure you that you will like Resonance. The opposite is also true, WEG is a great developer/publisher and has a pretty good library of p&c adventures."

This game is a challenge. A REAL challenge. First the brave and challenging stuff. This game is very very brave in my opinion. There are game mechanics that I have never seen before in a point-and-click. Long Term Memory (LTM) and Short Term Memory (STM) play a big role in this game. Not only do you have inventory items to talk about and give, but you can draw on your memory to piece puzzles together and solve the mystery. This was a very interesting idea, since it makes you really pay attention to every detail, and you have to pay attention to EVERYTHING. Plus, it makes you think about things that happened in the very beginning, especially at the end. Another strength is the idea of four protagonists. At the most I have only ever played with two protagonists. It's easy to keep track of their storylines and when working together, it isn't difficult to see how they should be used. Resonance is bold in making you play four different characters. Not only do you get to manage four different storylines (that is the easy part) but you have to maintain four different inventories, LTM's, and STM's. Thats where is can get kind of tricky, especially when you are expected to use all four protagonists at once. Certain characters can only go certain places and do certain puzzles. I went to a walkthrough a little more than I wished to, mainly because I wasn't patient enough to really sit down and figure it out. Don't get me wrong though, the puzzles can be difficult. This is the best looking Wadjet Eye game I think to date. It still has that wonderful retro pixel look,  but it is very smooth. The characters are all great and their storylines are easy to keep track of. Great voice acting all around. There is more than one way to solve puzzles and there is more than one ending, making in necessary to at least play through twice. This was a challenging game I am glad to have completed. I look forward to playing this again someday."

I am going to have to check out some of Wadjet Eye's other games now.This game is an old school style adventure game but with some new innovations that make it feel more fresh. Theres a Short Term / Long Term Memory system, four controllable characters, a unique conversation system, and lots of brilliant and unique puzzles, some of them with a hard scientific edge. The savegame system has steam cloud support, and there are steam trading cards and an extensive list of achievements, anda  commentary mode that add some replayablity.Now for the bad, the game was a little buggy, I came across a dialog glitch where everthing sped up and dialog was skipped through several times, and characters got stuck a few times, but nothing game breaking. The overall sound felt dated, as did the graphics, but I think it was deliberate as they were going for that old school feel. The soundtrack was actually pretty decent though. There are no graphics options, you can only run the game in a window, but it still plays decently despite this.Overall, the story felt modern and captivating. The game was challenging, but the story was intriguing enough I was compelled to keep plugging away. Will be playing through again to try and get 100% completion and some of the achievements I missed, I ended up 5 points away from 100% on my first playthrough!Pick this up at full price or on sale, either way you won't be dissapointed."

The renaissance of the point & click is in full effect and, as a fan of such things, I couldn't be happier. Developed by XII Games, Resonance can be downloaded for just a few bucks; to find out if you, too, should jump in, read on...The Four Main CharactersResonance is set in the wake of a super-scientific disaster, and put us in a unique situation of guiding four separate main characters as they run around solving puzzles to get to the bottom of a mystery. These characters also cross paths, interact, and try to figure out each other's motives. The four: a doctor, a mathematician, a detective, and a reporter (who is frequently and humorously reminded that he's just a blogger). Each have their own secrets, and finding them out is every bit as entertaining as unraveling the core mystery.The really impressive thing about this game is that each of the four characters has an incredibly strong reason to be involved in the events of the story. Typically in adventure games, the hero does it ""just for a lark"" (the vast majority) or because they're a bit nosey, even though they're putting their life at serious risk. Don't get me wrong, I'm not knocking those games, but there's a real sense of forced participation on the part of the main characters. And this is where Resonance shines because of the various motivations, and how nuances and morally ambiguous they can be, that put this game ahead of the pack.Controlling each of these four separate characters also adds a cool spin to the flow of the adventure. From a storytelling perspective, it creates a fascinating teamwork dynamic between the different members of the group as they spread out across the city solving puzzles that push them closer to the truth of the story. Strong voice work and punchy dialogue brings the characters' distinct personalities right to the fore, making their connection all the more interesting.GameplayOne extra thing worth noting is Resonance takes a risk by altering the standard point-n-click gameplay ever so slightly. Instead of talking to a NPC and having a preset set of keywords, Resonance adds a dynamic keyword system of sorts. You can drag any item into your inventory and then re-drag it onto a NPC later on to ask them about it (they call it Short-Term memory). Kind of neat little feature and well implemented. Its not some drastic gameplay altering change, but it does gives Resonance its own little uniqueness in a point-n-click genre that is pretty set in stone in its ways.And of course whats a good point-n-click adventure game without some puzzles? Resonance has some excellent ones; not too hard not too easy and nearly all based on logical real world solutions so even if you cheat and peek at the solution you'll go, ""Why of course! Why didn't I think of that."" Also, the puzzles fit seamlessly right into the story rather than feeling like arbitrary sideshows, which is great. How do you log into the top secret computer? Well you hack into a regular PC, check the emails, get just enough info to get someone's username on the super computer, reset their password on it, then check the new password in their email account on the regular PC. You will find none of that ""tie a cat to a pogo stick and use it to catch a passing pigeon, which you then glue a microphone to so you can have it fly outside the window and record the man talking about his password"".SummaryThe story is fantastic, the characters are believable and well-written, the music and artwork is wonderful, and there are some tough choices and genuinely shocking twists. Like the rest of Wadjet's catalog, Resonance is an absolute must play for any classic adventure nut, and worth checking out for any more modern fan.P.S. - You can also read my previous review of Technobabylon in here:http://steamcommunity.com/id/MrRokuro-san/recommended/307580/"

76561198012395761,Not Recommended,212050,33589599,Posted: 16 July,all,chainmatrix,"I love point-and-click adventures. Usually the only chore with this genre is that sometimes there is no rhyme or reason to the puzzles, and one ends up clicking and combining everything possible in order to proceed.This game has a similar problem with a twist. Most of the time it is clear WHAT should be done, and the actions make sense as such, but the user interface is so horrid it regularly is nigh impossible to figure out HOW to do it. In general, the game's UI makes doing anything at all as hard as possible, and not in an entertaining manner.Just an example: there is a thing you need to read to gain crucial information, and it is made clear you can't take the thing with you. In most games, simply reading the thing would unlock dialogue options related to it. Not here; you have to figure out that you CAN drag-and-drop the thing into a special inventory (""short term memory""), where it becomes a conversation item, that can then be used in dialogues elsewhere. Anything can be dragged into this inventory, but only a few items can be stored there at one time; as it is often not clear which STM items are important and where they should be used, this quickly becomes very annoying. (To muddy the waters even further, there's also a third separate inventory, for ""long term memories"". They also need to be used like items.)There are not enough saving graces either. Having several playable characters is an intriguing idea and one plot twist and a couple of puzzles utilize it nicely, but it also multiplies the irksomeness of the overly convoluted inventory system. (And that's a major issue, because most of the gameplay in this genre consists of inventory management.) The story is OK, but not very original. Graphics are very retro and get the job done, but are nothing to write home about. The characters are clichéd and lack depth. Dialogues are vapid. Atypically for a Wadjet Eye Games product, even voice acting and music are stale. And the vexing trial-and-error games in the end ensure the whole thing ends on a sour note.I crawled my way through, but playing this game felt like working a never-ending shift in an office where someone regularly hides your mouse and keyboard."

It's smart and has good puzzles and keeps fresh by moving between four intriguing characters and a number of explorable locations. However, about a third of the way in, at the moment when you are given the ability to switch between the four at will - when you can access their interchangeable inventories, use their short-term memories on virtually everything to recall things as conversation items, as well as calling on their respective long-term memories, and the ability to go to a slew of new locations, things get a bit overwhelming. This was where a friend and I called it quits. I eventually came back and followed a good community guide. This overwhelming bit actually doesn't last too long and then you return to a fairly linear but still quite open playstyle - totally manageable and more like other adventure games. It's got a great story that really picks up from that point on and the dynamic between the four works really well when the world is made more manageable. You might enjoy the complexity of the bit I found overwhelming but if not, and you too begin to play this great game and find yourself disheartened at the four-character exploration bit, just read that bit of a guide and then press on on your own again - it's worth it!"

There are some novel ideas that i've not seen elsewhere in a point & click adventure (mostly to do with the interface), but unfortunately a lot of them seem a bit poorly thought out, and become a bit awkward quite early on.Controlling multiple characters, for instance, means that the usual amount of backtracking ('go there', 'try using that' etc) required whilst experimenting with puzzle solutions is now increased by four. And having to remind characters to follow each other quickly became a bit of a chore.Some of the story beats don't really work either, and i found my attention starting to wane as a result."

Resonance is a seriously tremendous game, it nails everything right: good puzzles, amazing relatable characters with good character progression, music, sound effects, voice acting and atmosphere, good artstyle topped off with a good story.You can see how much hard work has went into this game, especially over multiple playthroughs, with easter eggs and attention to details, you get even more insight with the developer commentary option which so few games embrace, they also give a bonus of adding some bloopers from the voice over sessions, which add good comic relief.The only bad thing i can say about Resonance is that there is no resolution option, also what i think is a bug is when you shift tab to go into Steam it makes all conversation audio skip super fast, especially if you do not pause first, so careful if you are in Steam chat."

Have the right character(s) there, have the correct thoughts in your short- and long-term-memory, interact correctly with everything... A lot of this game's length comes from these unnecessary clicking orgies, and it gets boring fast. The interface isn't rewarding enough for you to grind your way to the problems' solutions. And then the ""world"" gets opened up and you have a whole lot more places to cover, which sounds great at first, but then you realize you have to do more clicking with every single character.Graphics, story, voice acting... all great and d'accord with the other Wadjet Eye games, but if you boggle down the player with unnecessary and unfun gameplay elements it's not worth it. I came from Gemini Rue which avoided exactly those issues and managed to challenge me maybe not as long, but much more satisfyingly. So Resonance is - after the first two joyful hours - a disappointment. Wouldn't recommend."

Definitely a case where less would have been more.Starts off well enough, the introduction to the four central characters is well done with a couple of mini puzzles to work out and an introduction to the idea of timed segments.  Unfortunately the game goes awry shortly after as we meet the most annoying janitor ever and he actively gets in your way with his incompetence.This wouldn't be unusual for a game like this and would be forgivable were it not for the simultaneous introduction of ""short term memory"", which basically means dragging environmental cues into your memory so you can talk to people about them.  A nice idea, but it overcomplicates the game far more than it needs to as you work out that the item you need to talk about is 3 screens away for the fourth time.  The game would be much improved by dropping the STM idea (it largely gets forgotten later in the game anyway so maybe the devs worked that out for themselves) and just including the relevant option in conversation.  Other daft complications such as asking which way to turn a wrench when there is only one way it can turn at any time offer more pointless frustration for the player.On the more positive side a few nice puzzles (if you like cryptography and maths) are very satisfying, unfortunately they lead in to one f the most frustrating parts of the game in Anna’s second timed scene.  Not being happy to be a point and click game the devs saw fit to introduce the need for fast mouse wiggling, which wouldn’t be so bad if it were not for the fact that one slip sends you all the way bad to have to re-listen to Anna shrieking over and over again each time.  This is an annoyance that reappears at various times as the rewind sends you back way too far.Some more lovely little puzzles, including one that really makes the most of the teamwork between all four follows before the story really kicks into gear, I won’t spoil anything but suffice to say it is worth persevering this far for it.  Unfortunately the final notes are a few more frustrations born form the need to pixel-hunt and trial-and-error conversations round out the game.Overall the devs at XII would do well to look at the Blackwell series(from the same publishers) for cues on how to add a little innovation and variety into an adventure game without going overboard, more restraint next will definitely help to prevent the game from getting in the way of the story as it does here.I'm recommending it because there are some nice ideas and there is a good story in there, just be aware before you play it that you will get frustrated and you will question why on earth some design decisions were made that way as you play."

In it, you assume the role of a group of people whose destinies are intertwined with a mysterious yet destructive device. The game starts with you witnessing a series of terrorist attacks where large holes have been “punched out of” various cities of note around the world.Gameplay consists of you switching at-will between either of the four protagonists while using their various tools and abilities to solve whatever puzzles are thrown your way. An interesting addition to the typical PnC mechanic is the ‘memory system’ which allows for things to be automatically catalogued in long memory but also gives the player the option to drag objects from the surrounding world into short-term memory for use in advancing dialogue and solving other puzzles.Besides solving problems, your companions also serve as a source of information for what to do next and whenever you are stumped you can simply ask around until you have a decent idea of what to do next. Like other games by this studio, there are easter eggs and multiple endings available. I particularly liked the optional puzzles spread throughout the game that served as a little reward for putting in a little extra effort. You don’t HAVE to solve them, but it gives a little bit of insight into things or an alternate solution to a puzzle that would have been solved with a more direct approach.Overall, I enjoyed playing Resonance and would recommend it to anyone looking for a nice short adventure game to while away an afternoon on."

The story here is very solid, the main characters are pretty interesting, the graphics and sound design are all pretty good, and some of the puzzles are pretty interesting and unique.I think the issues I have come down to the world itself being rather bland; the most out-there concept of the entire universe is the titular resonance itself, which for all I know could be real (probably not, but ehh.)As well, the game's flow is... well, it grinds to the halt for a section in the middle that feels reeeeally adventure game-y and the plot mostly comes to a halt for this section, too. As well, you have too many options and some of the puzzle solutions are obscure enough, plus the annoyance of having to constantly change characters, drag specific things into memory, give items to other characters because only certain characters can do certain things... it piles up into a rather unfun segment of the game that I pretty much gave up on and resorted to a walkthrough for, which I otherwise didn't use for the majority of the game.Other than that though it's enjoyable enough. The dream sequences are pretty unique and engaging, the timed puzzles are generally not too obscure as to require trial and error, and the game's length is pretty fine for the genre. It wasn't the most engaging or most memorable but it's a pretty enjoyable ride most of the way through with a pretty noticeable bump in the middle."

Even if there is not much replayability to be expected, Resonance is a solid adventure that is on par with old classics like Beneath a Steel Sky. Highly recommended!"

,Recommended,212050,7904894,"Posted: 3 December, 2013",all,The Professor,"Resonance is one of the better point & click adventure games I've ever encountered.It plays mostly like any other P&C, but it introduces some novel mechanics and follows through with them. On the familiar front, you've got multiple characters and an intuitive character switch panel. Dialog boxes are nothing new, and the player inventory is pretty common. What they've added are two inventory-like panels to the UI for long term memory (LTM) and short-term memory (STM).Both panels can be used similarly to the classic inventory. As events occur, a recap becomes available in certain character's LTM. By interacting with that directly, you can reply the event and remind yourself where you left off or what your current goals are. Or, you can drag the memory to a character (or into a conversation) to ask/mention that event. The short-term memory allows you to drag any object with a label into the STM panel where it becomes a similar memory that you can use to ask NPCs about.There are several puzzles designed into the game that require you to make use of these features, and they do it in clever ways that make these additions feel very natural. Your first ""aha"" moment solving one of those brings an extra buzz because of the way they integrate these new mechanics.The puzzle design is top notch and the story is quite compelling. Cast in the style of a 16-bit techno thriller, there's very little to its execution that you could accuse of descending into cheesy. It stays on top of the ball and its plot twists are well executed without a lot of TV-style telegraphing what's going to happen.If you're a fan of the adventure genre, you need to play this game."

I found the story intriguing and the atmosphere was great, particularly at certain points (one chase scene had me jumping and panicking more than most of the horror games I've played). The mechanics were nice as well. The four-playable-characters aspect was neat and I loved being able to instantly change between them (though trying to remember who was carrying what was sometimes annoying). I liked the implementation of Long and Short-term memory, and thus the ability to use things that you can't physically pick up as conversation prompts. There was some good humor mixed in, which I always appreciate in my point-n-clicks, and the art was lovely throughout.I did encounter a couple bugs along the way, but nothing too big, and nothing that I couldn't fix by loading (though if you didn't save a lot as I do they might have been more of a problem). My main gripe about the game is that some of the puzzles are VERY overly complicated. Don't get me wrong, I like difficult puzzles, but I do NOT like tedious puzzles and leaps of logic, and unfortunately Resonance has its fair share of those. I'm willing to look past them, though, because not all of the puzzles were that way, and because I liked the story and characters so much.All in all, it's a game I really enjoyed and will play again someday. Reccommend it to any adventure game fan, especially on sale."

Combine that with occasional real-time sequence that visibly rewinds and forces you to go through it again and again until you get it right, and an interesting game ends up turning its own interface into a laborious puzzle."

A clear homage to the adventure genre of the 90's, Resonance also brings something new to the table; the ingenious use of multiple characters to solve complex puzzles (think Maniac Mansion/Day of the Tentacle) and the invention of ""long/short term memory"", ie an ability to use any object and event as a ""usable topic"". With this new approach, Resonance raises the bar for the genre and makes it that more complex and appealing. The story is complex enough to grab a hold of you and the puzzles make sense. So it's not just nostalgia that draws you to the game, although I do love the retro graphics, it is actually a very clever little game. If you're an adventure game buff, I suggest you try it out."

Also, you'll find a lot of subtle humor and thought in unexpected places if you look closely.

Although the mechanics will not be anything new or different to anyone who's played 90's adventure games, the story and character interactions are great. Also, if your background with adventure games involves comical, colourful fare like Monkey Island and Day of the Tentacle, you may find the dark, sometimes bleak setting of Resonance to be an interesting twist.For me, having a retro adventure game set in a story where the characters face conspiracies, betrayals, and the threat of atomic annihilation was pretty compelling. True, there is a fair share of pixel hunting and the occasional stumper of a puzzle, but overall the flow of gameplay is quite smooth. Don't read any spoilers if you're interested in this game at all! It will be worth it."

A good plot (as long as you don't overthink it!) with some puzzles that get you thinking, but not enough to bring you out in a cold sweat for the most part. It seems that some of the harder problems can be dodged so that you can continue if things just get too much at those points...but where's the fun in that? :-)I've played Gemini Rue from Wadjet Eye as well, and though the story genre and mood are quite different, this is of a similar quality in my opinion...maybe a little better."

The story is very good and does a good job of engrossing you in the world. The charaters are also very well done, leaving you wanting to find out more about them & hearing more about what they have to say.A lot of the puzzle solving elements in this game really don't hold your hand. Assuming you don't use a walkthrough, they may take a while to solve if you haven't picked up the appropriate item along the way.... so you may end up having to re-visit earlier locations to find something that you previously missed.The graphics, although I'm assuming they were meant to look like a really old  retro point n' click game, do take a bit of getting used to though.Thoroughly enjoyed this one.
