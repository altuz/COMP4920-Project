76561198027069819,Not Recommended,212070,12826328,"Posted: 6 November, 2014",all,Henry,"I rate this game negative albeit I intend to play it further a bit and had some fun with it.It can be fun and is challenging but there are many negative aspects.- Pay to win. All currently available DLC's cost you 223,94 €. You get 4 or 5 AAA Titles for that.- There is a short Tutorial but the game is very complex and most things are unexplained. The Wiki is mostly in russian language.- Grind. All you do is to level up different ships to get a better one with slightly improved stats. rinse and repeat.- You can loot occassionaly usefull things for a certain module but since there are so many modules you can rarely update the stuff you need right now.- Balancing. The balancing is NOT for a fun game experience but solely for generating money for the developers. You will see MANY artifical walls which restrict you from progress when you don't want to pay the ""incredible"" prices for things that should be in there right away. this appears like extortion to me. And this will never end no matter how much you have paid already.- Long waiting times (1-5 minutes, European Server) when you want to do a battle. Be sure to have something to read for that time.- Depending on time of day few players so the battles are filled up with ""stupid"" bots.I have not done much PvE and been not in a Corp so I cannot rate these aspects. But corps mainly require Voice Coms (Teamspeak) so this only works if you live alone.Other reviews have mentioned unfair bans. I have none experienced myself but I will certainly NOT pay (waste) hundreds of Euros when the game can restrict me from playing it that easily.So the game can be fun if you like Grind and are willing to pay many money. Everyone else should be aware that this is a simple cash mashine for the developers where you provide them the content (opponents) and shall even pay for it. The more I think about it the more I dislike this business model.as reply to TigusVidikis's comment:>Pay to Win??? why?Because you can speed up your progress significantly with real money. Faster progress means faster success and an advantage over players who don't do it.> Premium ships are just different ships. Better in some stats, worse in others.But they start fully leveled. Non-premium ships are therefore worse from their stats until they are leveled up also. but there is little point in flying a leveled ship any more since you mostly want to level up the next one. so for most of the time the premium ship IS better.>The only real thing to give you an edge is and indirect bonus, if you go premium you get more XP and more loot.more xp and more loot (items, upgrades) means better stats than one who doesn't pay. better stats means better chances. better chances means winning more often. winning more often means even faster progress. so from my conclusion this IS pay to win.from what i have seen you can achieve most things by stupid grind. but it will take you a long while and will certainly not be fun for the most time. the game is purely balanced to annoy you so much until you pay. and the developers are greedy.for 1 € (euro) i get 300 galactic standards (gs).one month of premium licence (+50% xp, extra loot) cost you 3000 gs = 10 €a second set of implants cost you 2000 gs = 6,7 €a rank 11 ship costs you 6.2 million ingame credits this are around 12000 gs and thus 40 €.to change ONE visual aspect of ONE ship costs you 150 gs = 0,5 €.even beeing the mentor of a new character afaik costs you 200 gs = 0,7 €.so if you want to play it seriously and have fun doing it you have little chance without paying. thats what everyone starting this game must be aware of. if you have plenty of real money to spend play it. but don't let you fool by the ""free to play"" tag because this is a lie.I see that the developers must eat and want to be payed for their work. but the payment scheme applied in this game is obviously greedy and reminds me of extortion. and this is not only my opinion i have heard several other people mentioning this as the most annoying aspect of the game.update #2I have now spend lots of time in the game (and also few euros) and want to explain my long term experiences.Corp/buddies is important to have for flying together and get some tips.PVE is quite boring and repetitive.IDIOTS. I can't describe how frustrating this game is because of the idiots in it. there are many bad players who don't contribute to winning, refuse to help their teammates etc.. Its very frustrating when you constanly loose a match because of such people. And there are the players which have spent many time in game already (you are too late!) and have top (premium) ships, best equipment and experience. If you have those in enemy team you have mostly lost already before the fight even starts. So if you are a ""medium"" or average player like me you will recive constant frustration.The matchmaking system seriously SUCKS. If you want to team up with someone you have significantly increased waiting times (you spent half of the time in this game waiting for a match anyway). So if you want to play together (its multiplayer, right?) you will actually have less fun.And the teams are often very unbalanced with one side having a clear advantage over the other. The balanced and fair (=the fun) fights are 1/3 approximately.So with the greedy developers, the idtiot community and the crappy matchmaking system I CANNOT recommend this game to anyone. I'm sure there are better gaming experiences out there. Once my licence epxires i will leave the game for these reasons. Gaming should be fair fun and not unfair frustration."

I'll probably still play for as long as I can considering what I've invested already, but . . . This game has long deviated from what made me fall in love with it. Remnants are there but I can't help but comparing. What I really take issue with is how I see customers getting treated. Not me specifically, I am the way I am and I've just learned to accept any incoming consequences as a fact of life, to brush them off, and just keep going, but other people who go into things with a certain set of assumptions about their investment both time and money wise . .The latest example would have to be the transition from destroyers to alien ships. I am not a person who likes the idea of destroyers in the game as it has been put into practice. On paper great, but initially they were very strong. Yes they had events to get these ships easily, but now they are difficult to get and have a sort of air of exclusivity.On this basis you would think that at the very least, customers are rewarded with a strong ship for investing real money.  But now they've been nerfed into the ground. They needed it to be honest, but it coincidentally happened the same time they moved to the new faction with the alien ships.  The starter kit for which costs 40$ USD if you want to ""convenience"" your way to them and they are quite powerful. Maybe not so much in the hands of a new player but they can easily vs a whole team.Right now there is a broker mission and some grinding you can to do to get there for free, but I imagine by the time the general community finally gets to them they could be nerfed as the new ship is released, with a new 40$ starter kit.  I've seen this sort of game balance strategy before and it ruined the community of a game I cared very much about. MWO is now dead because of this sort of economic model. Maybe I'm wrong. That would be nice. I get very passionate about things I care about and trust me I would love to be wrong on this.So no, at this time I don't want to recommend this game because of my own opinion, but I will say:It's free, so it's not like you have to spend money to try it out. If you really like space games A negative review isn't going to stop you and If you feel you're having enough fun to spend money on it, that's great, there are a few DLC that have quite a bit of utility value especially when on sale. If I see you asking in game I'll probably even tell you which ones to get. I'm sure that if you like this game when you try it you'll leave a great positive review to offset this salty vet, but I still believe that if you feel like you need to spend money to have fun, then the game is playing you."

Make everything available for free but hide it behind a huge grindwall.Recipie:- Add new unbalanced OP content- Make it available immediately for money and put it behind a huge grindwall for free users- Until the average user get the content balance it- Add new OP content and repeate the processThe game had an awesome concept during the beta. After the devs implemented all their good ideas, they started to impelent the bad ideas as well.I don't say the game is not enjoyable sometime, but some of the content is seriously unbalanced, all the new ingame content cost crazy expensive and you have no option to buy it on a fixed price. (Some ships cost 2-300 EUR if you want to get it from the lottery packages whats the only way to get it.)Even if the devs made some good steps to support teamplay (again), its still far from the version what they had 4exampel in 2014.The new OP alien ship is comming.

,Not Recommended,212070,29938378,Posted: 15 February,all,Luckspeare,"Well, I decided to buck the disturbing trend in reviews, talking about this game as overly money-hungry, pay-to-win, and overly poor in the balance department.  I even plopped down over $100 for myself and my family for premium accounts, since progress without premium is incredibly, mind-numbingly slow, and the game is really fun and flows smoothly at first.  Plus, I like War Thunder (though I've hit a steep increase in the grind curve and haven't played it for quite a while), and so decided to give it a chance because Gaijin did at least some things very well.Well hoo hoo.  What a fool am I.  Everything they said is true.  And I feel like an idiot for giving the devs my money.A quick aside.  I used to play Warframe for quite a while.  I eventually left it in disgust for what became more and more clear -- the devs' focus on the exploitative aspects of the game, rather than improving the experience for the players and developing the depth of the game, and disrespect of the playerbase -- particularly their time.  And, most of all, its terrible grind that makes the game end up feeling like a job -- it progresses nicely and evenly at first, but then, even with a premium account, it takes forever.  And then there are time-limited goodies to get, but the gambling/loot system is rigged to screw you over so much that you have to put in an inordinate amount of time to get the time-limited goal/goodie fair and square by legitimate gameplay...  so why don't you just pay for it already and skip the grind, hmm?I got sick and tired of it.  Quit after a long enough time that I'm embarrassed to say it.  But I'm a lot quicker to spot this kind of game this time around -- after a couple of weeks, I'm already done with Star Conflict.  Had enough of grinding fights against players who you can't damage but who demolish you in seconds every time you pop your head up (because the matchmaking system pits you against players with ships far more powerful than yours).The straw that broke the camel's back was and then spending real money on gambling chests that promise all sorts of interesting things, though 5 of the items they can provide -- hardly noticeable in that impressive list of cool things -- are just small amounts of mundane resources that you get at the end of every mission and are sick of by the time you've played a week.  But that's 5 out of 40 items, surely I'd get at least one or two good things.Nope.  Bought a pack of 5 of these chests and got nothing but the mundane resources and a few crystals.  Really?  I guess they want you to buy chests, get nothing interesting, then keep buying more.  It's a mechanism used in a lot of exploitative games.The game has a lot of promise, and is fun, until you hit about rank 6 or 7, and then suddenly the grind increases a LOT to progress just a little, and you find it necessary to play PvP, where skill matters little and your equipment is massively underleveled.  You watch your hits ever so slightly decrement their shields, then suddenly you get rapid-fire 5-shotted in a matter of 1-2 seconds.  Not so fun anymore -- your job is now to be farmed, while you grind away, hoping some day to progress to the point where you are competitive, or at least can hold your own.  Or...  why don't you just buy the premium ships and pay for a ship that can win already?Just pay to win and stop complaining.Screw that.  No thanks.Not recommended, at all.  This business model and the mentality it encourages completely poisons every aspect of the game."
,Not Recommended,212070,29997930,Posted: 17 February,all,TKV | TurkeySandvichs,"TL:DR - Too grindy, pay to win. Devs have no foresight, and don't care about their community. Game is being used only to generate money (only way I can explain the decisions they've made).When I first started playing Star Conflict four years ago, I was absolutely hooked. It provided awesome full 3D space combat with gorgeous visuals and lovely sound design (including music). Unfortunately, I got to know the game. Over the last four years, not much has changed in terms of outward appearance, but the mechanics have taken a drastic turn for the worst.It was always a grind (and a bad one at that), but it has gotten worse. Not only have they rearranged the tech tree into a jumbled mess, but they have added new ship types that just boggle the mind when it comes to obtaining them. The Destroyers, for example, require components to build which, in turn, require resources thatcoulddrop from post-mission looting ormightdrop from open space resource nodes. You can spend real money to purchase resource crates, but even they have an RNG component which randomizes what you get from them.They are doing the same thing for premium ships. What you were once able to purchase using real money for a respectable price, they are now changing their acquisition method to resources unique to each premium ship, which are just as rare (if not rarer because there are so many items now diluting the drop pool) than other ship components from random drops. If you want to buy the resources outright, it is once again a random drop from a crate. Doing the maths; premium ships cost WAY more than before.Ship module upgrades are a must-have if you want to remain competitive in PvP. But, not only has item upgrading been made even more tedious than it was before, you are able to instantly upgrade an item using premium currency. If that isn't pay-to-win, I don't know what is.This game was made by the same company as the one that made War Thunder. Despite Star Conflict being developed by a different studio, the problems with the developers persist. They are toxic about feedback. If you slander their game publicly, they will retaliate with bans or something else, and they don't listen to community feedback (where economics are concerned at least). They also seem to have no grasp of game economy mechanics. Having an RNG loot table is all well and good, but putting critical progression items into that table, diluting it with useless garbage like small credits caches, and then continuing to pileeven moreprogression critical items means that it just becomes impossible to get anything with any reasonable reliability. They don't seem to have any intention to fix that, and why would they? It would mean people won't buy crates.This has turned into a bit of a rant, so I'll end it here. You only need to glance at other reviews to see how downhill this game has gone, and it is only continuing its depressing descent with every new update."

,Not Recommended,212070,30250855,Posted: 28 February,all,Johnnynator,"After a few thousands hour playing this game and following the development for a couple of years, I can say that the game is just going into a more and more unbalanced state every patch and everything that is OP is either behind a pay or a grind wall or just no accesable anymore coz reasons.Examples:Phoenix: Premium Engie with OP drones that don't switch to healing when the shield is doneThar'Ga: Alien Gunship behind a ridicilous Grind Wall with an imense DMG Output while being fast and durable, the only thing that this ship is bad in is healingVigilant, Sirius, Tyrant: only T5 Destroyers but can't be build anymore and where behind a grindwall beforeDart, Gargoyle: OP Premium Ships that were behind a paywall but are not avaible anymore-----So much for the Balancing in this game, but the new changed Sector mode is clearly showing what the devs want from this game: quantity, not quality, You get an sector if your corp is bigger then another but you don't have to be better and the devs also increased only a few month ago the maximum size of a Corporation so that Corp leaders can spend more money for their roster...I could write so more points about  what is going wrong in this game, but I think it is better if I just stop...Or just read Gizmo.mac's review, hes hitting the nail right on the head with his discription on how this game is going atm."

It has top of the line graphics at that time, tbe best open world exploration, it's just overwhelmingly funNow, the game has been ruined by its greedy developers. Everytime when there's a holiday, the devs view it as a cash grab time instead of a time to give players free stuff and to make them level up faster. Every weekend, same, cash grab time. Recently, things got worst when Thar'Ga came out. My team's destroyers just got completely shredded by a swarm of enemy Thar'Ga. The game is extremely unbalenced unlike back in the good old days. The mods are unprofessional, and disrespectful (I got a violation warning for no reason). In fact, I was so close to uninstalling that day. The only way to win this game is to grind 24/7 or pay.

But now, the event with aliens ships and need to play or pay for xenocrystals, to obtain very imbalanced alien gunship plus their equpment, it is for noob children with parent's wallet. Now, it is impossible stand in battle with ordinary ship, even if your modules are maximized at lvl15. Team with more Thar'Ga gunsips will win every battle.

If anoyne knows another game that does that (and isn't 10 years old with a dead playerbase), let me know.Interesting world with an evolving (if very hidden storyline).Relatively decent assymetric balance outside noted below.Con's:PAY TO WIN. This game is about as pay to win as you can get. TECHNICALLY you can get everything in the game with sufficient grind. But sufficient grind for the latest and greatest items is measured in months or even a year, by which time it's been nerfed, and the cycle has started again. And the latest items ARE the greatest. If you've got a gaming wallet with thousands (Not an exaggeration, by the way), then this game might be for you.Awful developers. Extremely sensitive to feedback, any post on the official forums that is slightly critical gets deleted rapidly by moderators. If you don't have a direct line (pay to feedback maybe?) to the developers, you aren't getting heard unless it's sunshine and roses.Awful server availability. This depends a little on where you are, but over half of the games will be played on Russian servers, and ping matters for true competitiveness. If you live in Europe then this isn't as much of a consideration.The community is about average for a free, competitive game, at least the English-speaking part is. No more toxic than most, but no less.Overall, there is plenty in the game to enjoy but it's spoilt by terrible balance towards extreme wallet warriors and devs that focus on short term cash decisions."

76561198027831904,Recommended,212070,25066253,"Posted: 21 August, 2016",all,Bif,"Star Conflict is a nearly flawless (in my opinion) space combat simulator. The complexities and the fun of this space combat build slowly through the levels, starting from a very high standard and getting better from there. There is an adequate crafting minigame and some half-baked questing. Optimizing the ship is made up of several minigames taken collectively. Optimization in its several pieces makes up a good, fun minigame.There are areas of the game in need of improvement, yet the game as a whole is certainly in the top ten percent of space simulators. This review makes the case that Star Conflict is easily THE BEST f2p space combat simulator. We will not dwell on the shortcomings here, because the idea here is that you should just enjoy the game as it is at any given time and mostly let the devs worry about how to improve it. Overall, this is a great game.If you are very diligent in researching the reviews, you will find many reviews that say, ""This game used to be great, but they ruined it."" These people are trying to help you, and they are giving you their honest opinion. But they are limited in focus to the particular changes that annoyed them, and in my opinion most of them would admit they are not really reviewing the game as a whole.Here is the real reason for all the ""They ruined the game!"" reviews: When the devs make something new, they want the community to step into the new material and try it out. Therefore, as it is in almost any game that has ongoing development, NEW STUFF IS ALWAYS OVERPOWERED. Once everyone has tried it, the devs scale it back into balance with the rest of the game. Some of the 'they ruined it' reviews are due to new stuff coming in overpowered, and some of these reviews are due to previously overpowered content finally being balanced with the rest of the game.The game is living and evolving. This is a good thing! Your investment in this game will be rewarded with all kinds of new adventures, and the fun never stops. Yes, read all the reviews. But please understand the underlying reasons for the huge variety of reviews is a very good thing: a great game that grows and evolves over time. What are you waiting for?"

It's not F2P as u can read in description40$ for one ship bundle (i mean Tharg'a, 15k GS price, not even fully 'perk'd') is way too much. Sure, u can play at default ships. But don't forget about 'unique' modules at premium ships :DDevs took wrong way to 'dance' with community making everything as awfull as hardkuk-grind without any donuts. This grind is even harder when u don't own special scanner to find good items in open space.Open space is dead. Until it won't be as alive as in EVE and PvP would be normal game mode (not when one 'pro' which donated over 1k$ oneshots 10 normal players; one team gets premade of 3 guys, other gets noone; 7 Tharga's cancer' in enemy team, 1 in yours and they farm your spawn).Most of reviews are with thumbs up from those 'devs-friendly' corps&pilots.I don't whine about destro's, devs must understand that chances to win for both teams must be equal. Do they even tried to make new account and try to play on lvl 1-3? When u meet lvl 6-9 ships in enemy team?The dev will say, they are nearly equal at stats&eff. And that's all.Thx god they boosted ranks of Gargoyle and other cancer ship to lvl 11.P.S And btw, some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ guy which was working on achievements thought that adding Achievement which goal is to kill over million of AI controlled units or pirates (which will rekt u on top-tier ships faster than u) in open space to get karma lvl 5 is very fun and adds 'replay-ability'."

So you worked hard for that r8 or r11 dessie? Oh, you silly! You get swarmed by 1 thar ga or more, game over man.This is out of hand, now there are matches where half of the team are only allien ships. They have extreme firepower, insane amount of modules and regen capabilities. So how you counter that? You have to maufacture your own allien ship and GRIND YOUR FACE ON CONCRETE FOR MATERIALS. Also the so cool dreadnought battles are forgotten as well. I'll stop playing this for a while, I keep ranting on matches, and all my bloody progress holds no meaning now because the blessed Thar ga.

The events aren't fun and the one event I did complete I later learned ment nothing.-THE GAME IS NOT PAY TO WIN-If you see people whining about that, it's because there are ships you can buy using in game currency.BUTYou can earn the ingame cash via tourneys, answers questions (When they roll around) and completing a few other tasks. On top of that, any ship you can buy in game is only as good as a max level version of the same ship type. The difference is what Rank they are, that's it.Don't get me wrong, the balance of the game is shot, it's not that fun, certain weapons need to be removed (Like a gun that locks you pulls you to a point, damages you and makes it so you can't see) or reworked (An ability that locks you down for 6+ seconds or the ability to turn so tightly you literally can't hit them.) and certain classes in the game (Engineering Frigates, Command Fighter and Gunship) can't preform because of the games meta, but down downvote the game for the wrong reason."

,Not Recommended,212070,30041618,Posted: 19 February,all,Silphen,"The only reason I can't recommend this game is the Pay2Win setup. I played this game since beta, and I'm a returning player. It used to be really fun and anjoyable, and fairly balanced. But now, everything is nothing more than a microtransaction.Want to set a premade avatar? Real money. Want to build a ship? Grind forever or real money. Want to upgrade modules? Grind or real money. Want a ship that's on par with the P2W ships? Real money.Overall, the gameplay itself is excellent and the variety in ships is....average for the life of this game. Graphics are pretty good too. I like the pacing in the game when it comes to combat. Other games with a similar feel (Dreanought and Fractured Space) are too slow for my liking.The devs also are super restrictive with their forums. Need a guide? Don't bother. All the posts are a year or more old. All posts require dev approval. At the time of updating this review, I've waited almost 2 weeks for a forum post to be approved for a guide (probably why the forums are dead). Don't bother criticizing their devs on their forum though, those posts are immediately deleted from what I've been told.All-in-all, it's free. Give it a shot and see if you like it. I'm leaving my thumbs down because there are some serious progression/grind flaws, lack of dev transparency, and obvious P2W issues. But the gameplay itself is good once you spend weeks upgrading modules to be useful, lol"

However, I think that degree is lowering exponentially, as I am hugely successful in the game without paying a cent. Many people agree with me on this, and the content itself is SPECTACULAR. My overall analysis is that there is a lot of work to be done, but it could be amazing."
,Recommended,212070,23957426,"Posted: 30 June, 2016",all,Pasha,"I play the game for many years (3?). It's very nice and fun - until you get to rank 6. Then you either go farm open space or you may continue with arenas which turn into horrible pop-fest where you are the one being popped non-stop - and I'm talking about experience of above-average player. Still the game is free and initially it's fun so you should definitely try it.Pros:nicely designed arena instances (both art and tactical layout);good looking ships;different play style for different classes of ships;quick initial progression;nicely designed combat;interesting open space sectors / treasure hunt / crafting concept;game run well on old PCs;a lot of different weapon types;decent horizontal equipment progression;decent AI.Cons:""PvE"" and ""vs AI"" modes are badly balanced after rank 6 - as rank 6 you'll face L9 NPCs with epic-grade equipment;as often happen in PvP arena games - pre-mades roflstomp casual players, you tend to lose matches much more often than win them;heavily P2W mid/end-game: most powerful ships (destroyers, crafted L15) must be purchased or require months of focused farm (for example after *2+ years* I'm not even close to get any of those - it will take at least +1 more year);mid/end-game progression is too slow unless you purchase premium status, combined with NPCs and premades killing you non-stop it feels like a visit to a dentist without painkillers;badly designed mid-end-game may turn your progression into vertical wall;open space / treasure hunt / crafting are underdeveloped and could take a lot of polish and improvements;scarce resources for equipment progression, no point to waste them until you get to rank 14-15 ships.Conclusion:game is very fun in the beginning, has awful mid/end-game and has very interesting (but underdeveloped) open space, treasure hunting and crafting concepts. Despite flawed end-game I like it more than all other spaceship MMO games as a casual player."

In the beginning it was pretty easy to play it, but then in time i was hitting aginst a wall with my progress. The graphics are nice but the gameplay...The first moment i realized since the update with the alien fraction was that the game started to change. My rewards got less and less and the time I used in every playmode has gotten much more, sometimes i thought my gaming skills were lacking. After the news caught my attention, I knew: dis♥♥♥♥♥♥♥is PAY TO WIN!!Star onflict has gotten more and more boring and the devs focused on making players pay money for everything that gave a good progress.The ressources needed to manufacture for example a Destroyer were too hard to get, and the biggest problem of all, the clan NASA (server: EU) has kind of taken over the gameplay.I despise this game and abandon it forever, because it reminds me of Daybreak. Daybreak is likely focusing only on gaining money, so is Gaijin.My advice: don't waste your time on this game,it's the worst you will ever find."
