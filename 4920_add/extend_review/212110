That's exactly the power it has in Sugar Cube: Bittersweet Factory: a shortand sweet2D puzzle platformer in which you play as—you guessed it—a sugar cube with the passive ability to alter the physical state of almost anything he touches.Each of the 90 levels in the game is a single screen overlaid with a grid. Your goal is to get from the starting point to the exit by flipping certain squares on the grid to on/off states that enable or disable platforms, obstructions, switches, hazards and more. You can also hold down a button to temporarily disable your powers while you move, which allows for some much-needed precision in choosing the cells you flip. Enemies, some with abilities of their own, are sometimes added to the mix to make solutions more complex.The platforming is rough around the edges and imprecise, serving only as a crude means to execute the puzzle elements; the graphics, while cute, are low-resolution and don’t scale well to full-screen; and, while there are a few challenging puzzles, solving most of them is like taking candy from a baby. Aspartame recommends it, but the rest of me feels that it's unlikely to satisfy most people."

Seemed like an easy way to use up steam funds and break even.But wow, the gameplay actually takes some lateral thinking to get around the puzzles in the game! It's very casual compared to platformers like vvvvv, 140, or spelunky, but this game takes a simple mechanic of tiles changing as you move past them, and works with it to create an interesting, curious, yet fun and laid back puzzle platformer.Well worth the $1.74 it's currently selling for in the November sale. Check it out!"

,Recommended,212110,10390164,"Posted: 7 June, 2014",all,babycakes,"A platform puzzle game with cute art and story concept. The music, though not varied, is also cute. As for gameplay, your goal is to break out of different factories, which are composed of many levels. The puzzle part involves a unique tile-flipping mechanic; you must figure out which tiles to flip in order to escape. Other controls are simple: arrows keys to move, spacebar to jump, and shift key to turn tile flipping on/off. You can slightly influence your direction mid-jump to lean out more left or right, then lean as you fall back in your original spot. You cannot defeat enemies by jumping on them (""You're not Mario!""); you can only avoid them or manipulate the environment around them.I haven't finished the game, but the puzzles I've encountered in the first and second factory were easy to medium difficulty. Therefore, this game appears to be for a more casual level of playing. Some levels made me scratch my head, but I got the gist after several restarts. If you want to get the achievements for not dying, that will be very challenging.My true motivation for buying this game was to craft the steam badge and get a wallpaper and emoticon. THEY'RE ADORABLE, OKAY?If you wait for a sale, then you can get the game for cheap."

The minimal challenge present is largely artificial, often based on some combination of biased hit detection, erratic enemy patterns or awkward portal jumping.I do give it credit for its appropriately saccharine concept, but Sugar Cube isn't really worth wading through for that alone."

Like many puzzlers the theme is largely irrelevant as it resolves around an abstract concept anyway.I only played this game for about 30 minutes before I essentially made up my mind so perhaps my review is inaccurate. I usually give a game a little longer before a review but I had some core issues with the game that I didn't see changing anytime soon.Sugar Cube feels like a game that seemed like a good idea on paper but in practice just isn't fun. The central mechanic revolves around 'flipping' segments of the room to change the layout.  In theory this might sound interesting but my experience is that this quickly devolves into a tedious guessing game as there is often no visual cues where tiles need to be flipped so many puzzles you start out jumping around simply to locate where the necessary components are.After the pieces are located the puzzles were not partciularly challenging or satisfying and if there was a challenge it was often because a pixel-perfect jump was required at some point. In my short 30 minutes of gameplay I played through the first world and half of the second and the challenge rating did not really increase. At the end of the first world a ""boss"" was featured but really he was simply a giant obstacle to avoid and was not any more challenging than any other level.The game's artwork has very limited animations and animated characters in the game feature only a couple of frames and as a result the game feels largely still and lifeless.This game does support USB controllers but all the ingame instructions refer to keyboard controls so you are left to guess which controller button does what or go to the options menu.Score: 2/10"

The game mechanics with flipping blocks back and fourth just feels janky to me. I finished all of the normal levels just so I could uninstall this game without feeling bad. Being the retro platform junkie that I am, the graphics and art style are nice but this game just dosen't do it for me.3/10"
,Recommended,212110,13260736,"Posted: 6 December, 2014",all,720,"Disclaimer: This review was written in part by my sister, Samara, who played a lot more of this game than I did.There are a lot of puzzle platformers out there, some can be tedious and boring, but others take the basic elements of the genre and combine other aspects to create a game that is enticing and cute, but at the same time progressively challenging and unique. Sugar Cube: Bittersweet Factory falls under the latter, and fits this description perfectly.Sugar Cube: Bittersweet Factory's cute art style is one that will be sure to please a younger audience. Set in a factory that produces chocolate and bubblegum, each stage has different aesthetics and level design, while upping the difficulty each time you pass through the door and onto the next level.In each level are tiles, and when walked past, they will flip to reveal a surface. This gives Sugar Cube: Bittersweet Factory a slight trial and error system, where you need to make educated guesses on which tile will reveal the next fragment of the level for you to continue. Sometimes the most obvious places aren't the answer, and this can sometimes lead to some frantic rushes to find the next exit before you get attacked by Sugar Cube's many enemies.After each of Sugar Cube: Bittersweet Factory's four stages, there is a boss battle. Each boss represents its factory, and has certain features that differentiate it from the others. These bosses aren't generally as hard as the levels themselves, but there are tiles in these levels too, meaning you not only have to battle the boss, but worry about where you're standing as well. Sometimes the tiles will affect the boss, and flipping them in certain ways will determine its downfall.Overall, Sugar Cube: Bittersweet Factory is a sweet but cruel platformer, with elements of puzzles and other more challenging chunks taken from other games thrown in for added measure. Sugar Cube's world is colourful and different, and is one of the best independent puzzle games available. I recommend this game to people young and old, who will enjoy a fun and entertaining game that isn't bogged down by boring level design or tedious gameplay."
