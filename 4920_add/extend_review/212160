76561198192120733,Not Recommended,212160,29411445,Posted: 21 January,all,Shippuu,"Up until Jan 20, I used to run one of the longest standing Fan Sites for this game.After the only other Fan Site owner was permanently banned over a false detection, with Nexon NA refusing to even consider unbanning her, I have decided that this game is no longer worth me investing my time in, to keep my site going. The other Fan Site owner agrees with this sentiment. And so there are no Vindictus Fan Sites left now.They have such consistent and alarming disregard for the playerbase that it is legitimately going to be what kills this game in the end. I have thousands of hours put into this game (most of it from before they got rid of the ability to launch the game directly), thousands of hours of volunteer work put into my site, and have always been willing to help anyone that asks me for information about things. What does Nexon NA think of me and people like me? That we are troublemakers that shouldn't be taken seriously or associated with (this was stated directly by a forum moderator given power by Nexon to manage the community).The EU playerbase is unfortunately going to have to deal with Nexon NA management soon, and even before the transition has fully occurred, I am told by many EU players that a significant portion of the EU playerbase has quit the game over changes NA has already forced upon EU, with no regard to the situation EU has to deal with (economic differences, primarily).If you want to find a new game to play, this is not it. Not until Nexon gets their act together and cleans up the mess the Vindictus staff have made of this game. Those of us still playing are likely only doing so due to the huge amount of time and effort we have already sunk into this game."

They've ruined the only online hack and slash game worth playing by treating their playerbase like absolute nuisances. They've taken down every single fan site that has supported the game and continue to ignore the pleas and criticisms of their playerbase.When I first started playing Vindictus in 2011, I fell in love with the simple but oh so satisfying gameplay. The rush you feel when you finally defeat a boss in this game is unmatched. I toiled through the early levels, farmed for gear, and prayed to RNGesus to enhance said gear.But once I hit the end-game was when Nexon really ramped up the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Gatcha upon gatcha events. Failing servers (namely Arisha release). Pompous volunteer mods banning well known community members for absurd reasons (You can go to hell Aquasol and Dealer).Now they've taken down all of the fan sites that have been maintained by players who received not a word of thanks or appreciation from Nexon for promoting their game and aiding the playerbase. I hate Nexon NA for ruining a game I loved and spent so much time on. I hate them and their ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t policies and Terms of Service. With Sanitee banned and Vindictus Manual gone, I've decided that I'm tired of their ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Thank you to the West players for giving me some of the most exciting moments in gaming that I've ever had, especially in a rough patch where I contemplated suicide. I'm done with this game and I warn anyone curious about this game to turn back. This game isn't worth playing anymore."
76561197972308918,Not Recommended,212160,29550243,Posted: 28 January,all,KamakaziChimp,"This game was a prototype.What do I mean by that? Idea's, lots and lots of ideas. The original (Yes there have been several over the years) development team of the game had a vision of an MMO and was one of the first RPG MMO's to break with ""tab targeting"" and tradition class roles in an MMO. By all accounts they did a damn good job on that front as well. Fast paced combat with some of the most stunning visuals in an ""MMO"" at the time all while having ""most"" characters viable in group/solo play (Was balanced out later on so that all characters were viable)At this point you may be asking yourself why the negative review then? Greed. Nexon is know the world over in smaller gaming circles as one of the greediest Publishers in existance. Think of the Korean version of EA and that basically sums up the taste it leaves in most peoples mouths who've played one of their titles. Every single aspecr of the game is tied to RNG (A chance to obtain X-Y-Z) and when you want to improve a shiny new weapon/armor piece you spent well over a month to try a aquire via enhancements/enchantments you have rather HIGH odds for that shiny piece of gear to be destroyed if either fails. To protect against such a happening they have ""Microtransactions"" that can protect your items up to a certain extent.Micro being ANYTHING but as you can easily spend $300 on a single item trying to get the to the ""Halfway point"" Meaning +10 with 2 enhcantments. Alas you think you're done? Nope, still having 5 enchantment levels to go each attempt WILL destroy your gear if it fails. In 5 years of playing I had managed to make a +14 and 2 +13's. Thats it. Some 5,000+ hours of play time and a figure of money most people would be ashamed to admit.Nexon takes and takes and takes has no love for the people who give them the money to keep developing their business. On that note nexon had decided the development team was too ambitious and scaled back the scope of the project. This lead to unrest in the team causing most member of the original developers to either quit or be fired. Customer service is rarely of any use and will fight you until they legally cannot. Yes, they have done things in the past that were against multiple US/EU consumers rights and ""Fair business"" practices. Claiming that they had done nothing wrong when in fact their own ToS/EULA even states that what they had done was against their own terms.The icing on the cake as some have mentioned was the implemention of ""Community Moderators"" who in essence swear blind faith to nexon and run rampent throughout the fourms destroying what little community was left after the first year the game was released (some 100,000+ active players in that time frame down to some 5-6,000 these days IF that) dividing most of the memebers into camps of ""Eveythings fine"" and ""This game needs help"" even being civil merely discussing issues with the game/company and plausable ways for them to rectify them can result in forum bans.Last but no least, whales. Cash cows run rampent in the game with impunity. The more you spend, the more you are allowed to break the terms of service. I myself in the final days started using various hacks/scripts, posting Youtube Videos of me doing such, posting these on the forums attempting to bring all manner of attention to what players were capable of doing to the game and what was the response? A forum ban. My account itself was untouched, active and fully functional. When I inquired about my account not being banned to customer support the ticket was instantly closed, when I used an alt account to do the same (the alt account had no money spent on it and was outside of an identical IP address had no associtation with my primary account was promptly banned from the forums without reason.If you want to experiance this game do yourself a favor and play ""Black Desert Online"" many of the same people who developed Vindictus are working on BDO under their own company setting their own pace and it shows in the fact that they've made multiple millions of USD more than Vindy over a single year compared to Vind's entire life of 6 almost 7 years.TL:DR Nexowned isn't an enderaring term, avoid a graveyard of ""Good ideas blinded by greed"""
,Not Recommended,212160,29638907,Posted: 1 February,all,SaltMartini,"I no longer recommend this game because of Nexon's unjust January 2017 perma-ban of player Sanitee.As a Vindictus fan from 2012, I have seen countless players (including myself) leave Vindictus, only to return for its unique combat. It has a medieval taste to it, your actions have weight, and it's dodge or die. The fluid combat system relies on building combos with the mouse instead of your MMO-1 through 9 keys. Gameplay relies on timing dodges and slamming combos in between.Sanitee created fansites, contest-winning art, YouTube channels, and databases FOR THE COMMUNITY. Forum moderation deletes negative threads and difficulty working with customer service creates a global sensation that the players are not cared about.P2W? More like pay to get ahead or pay to look pretty. Real cash cannot save you from end-game gear-destroying RNG. Real world currency can buy rare cosmetics to sell for in game currency to buy pro level equips. Feel free to be the cheapskate we all are, grind your gear for free, but the eye-candy cosmetics for $10 are hard to resist. It's just as enjoyable F2P.The real game is in finding your friends to stand by your side in the dungeons. The story is about humanity's war to find peace, there are movies and voice-overs, and regular updates from the Korean version. Bring a friend and you'll love it, or you'll quit and end up coming back for the Dark Souls gameplay.Nexon though? I would like to see them contact myself and the community about Sanitee's ban. Until then, this negative review stands, warning new players of your reputation."

I've spent about a thousand hours on this game before it popped up on steam so I hopped on to see if it had gotten any better but I was wrong.

I have played this game on and off for the past 6-7 years and reached end game with 6-7 different characters. I will list out the following pros and cons of the game and you can decide whether you want to try this game or not.Pros:- Looks amazing even comparing to many recently developed games- Action combat system is almost second to none- Good customization in terms of fashion- Continues to get updates from Korea (still very popular in Kr)- Raids are fun to doCons:- One of the worst publishers in terms of the following:+Cash grab+Very pay to win, you can instantly become the strongest player on the server as long as you pay+Gachas... enough said+Forcing you to install their anticheat program that is  borderline spyware (blackcipher)+Extreme censorship on anything negative you say on their forums+Some weird hatred on fansites and the length they go to ban the site owners- Game is dungeon based (can be a pro if you like this)- PVP is not balanced whatsoever, PVP is only done to trade wins in order to get rewards- Nexon NA- Nexon NA.. did I mention nexon NA?Bottom Line: Game itself is great, the publisher makes it unbearable."

This once again was made clear very recently when a well known/helpful player that had already been falsely banned once (a improper ban that was overturned) was improperly banned again to which Nexon NA basically said, 'We've already fixed a mistake we made once, so we won't do it again.' What?? So if Nexon makes a mistake once it's 'hey we'll fix it"", but if they make a mistake twice it's, ""go pound sand'? Great system/people...That is the type of management this game has, beware.So it's worth giving a try, but not worth spending any money on."
,Not Recommended,212160,29882078,Posted: 12 February,all,Sergeant Gunny,"One of the best Action Combat MMOs I have ever played.PROS: Good free to play game you can easily enjoy without paying money. Outstanding fast-paced combat with lots of variety, and decent graphics (back then, anyway).My friends and I played the HELL out of this game a few years ago.  What really kept us playing was the great action-based combat, and amazing amount of detail and intricacy involed with the production this game.  When we discovered this game and how great it was, we started the guild called ""V for Vindictus"" and it quickly became one of the largest guilds in the game.  Vindictus is really one of the best free to play action-based combat MMOs we have ever played.CONS: The game is a few years old now, and showing its age.  Also, my account got hacked a long time ago, so I pretty much stopped playing since then.  It is almost entirely instance-based dungeons, where you que up solo or in a group depending on the level of the dungeon, etc. you need to do.  The problem with groups is sometimes you get people from the other side of the world connecting to the game using potato-powered internet, which will then lag out the game for everyone.  My advice is to avoid pickup groups, and join a guild to group with.MORE CONS: Whats with Nexon allowing trigger-happy, power hungry forum admins that ban some of the most infuential people for Vindictus of ALL TIME? (Fan-site and gaming community leaders)? A game company that cares little to none for its customers, which is the cheap way for Nexon. That forum admin should at least be permanently banned. It seems like many recent players are saying the game is dying, which is not surprising, as it has had a pretty good run for a Nexon game.LOLWUT:  If you really like action-based combat games with depth, then I recommend you just give Vindictus a try.  Other than that, I recommend most people avoid it, or if you DO play it, don't spend any money, since Nexon has pretty much screwed over the player-base of this game."

,Not Recommended,212160,29481775,Posted: 25 January,all,Tree Μage,"I've been playing Vindictus for many years even before I started using steam and was an active player until the past year. The game itself is very unique and can't be found nowhere in regards to game play, graphics, and story line but those specification in the game also can be the issues that make any player stop playing. This will be a long post.Perspective of 2016's game play:UPSIDE:- story updates have been chugging along (finally) with new content and outfits from eastern servers- smooth combat play and realistic physics, where you can affect objects inside the dungeon- server lag is occasional/rare- beautiful avatar and outfit customization- beautiful and creative combat and weapons for classes and boss monstersDOWNSIDE:- very dependent on gaming specs and internet strength for hosting, limiting players that can host, not to mention sacrificing high graphics for a smoother game play- tons of glitches and bugs visual-wise- too small of a community for my comfort- limited color options when dying outfits and choosing hair- despite having new updates, the time in between is very predictable and slow just to make enough money in a few months only to spend it and do it over again- events and prizes in between updates feels repetitive with recycled items- making money in the game is very dependent on RNG, not to mention losing money- almost after every update, there will be glitches and lag with maintenance when the game is online- certain features of the game that gets a revamp seems obsolete and/or not making sense, including the recently added class specific chat, broken friends list search/offline display, marketplace previews, and screenshot mode- a sense of community is very rare in-game, with little benefits of being in a guild and little participation in pvp and seige- there are few guides outside of the game making it harder to run dungeons with newer players (god knows if a dungeon is completed if half the party have end game gear but don't have good stats or know how to dodge)- the NX cash item shop is very pricey and a good portion use or have used NX in some point in the game- poor customer service overall, whether it is with tickets being delayed and forgotten, little compensation, or completing a request which never was done- there has been a recent controversy of banning active players for no good reason and other mistakes of mass suspending groups of people in the pastIn the end of the day, if someone wants to give this game a try, by all means I would recommend playing it just to experience the novelty of the combat, but in the long run the amount of time and money being put into this game will be determined by how motivated you are into playing this game."

76561198042010476,Not Recommended,212160,29429726,Posted: 22 January,all,Rzaney,"As much as I'd to give this game a thumbs up, the game has several issues that have been brought up time and time again and never been fixed simply because Nexon NA doesn't care. I have at least 1000 hours overall put into this game, some on the launcher and some on steam, but I'm thinking of stopping entirely now due to some recent events that have taken place. (Jan 22, 2017, tl;dr for the game itself at the bottom)But for starters, we'll talk about the game itself- The good:- The combat system is simply one of the best, if not the best in any MMO, and even better than some single player oriented games I've played like Dark Souls and The Witcher. The hitboxes are clean, the action is quick (and even faster once you get some attack speed), and the bosses have a lot of variety in the mid to late game that keeps you on your toes, and stumbles even some of the best players from time to time. The hack and slash elements here are very well done. I would entirely recommend someone to play this game simply for the combat system(but to be aware the early game is very muchly a grind and a faceroll until about the ainle missions, or even the polar bear if you're new to this type of game).- The character classes are very diverse and unique from one another. Nearly every single character plays entirely different to the other characters, even between their weapon types if they utilize more than one. You want safer, consistent ranged combat, you pick your xgun or bow Kai. You want to get off a huge burst of spells and gtfo, you pick your staff Evie. You want to get in the face of the boss all the time, and stay there. you pick your Pillar or Cestus Karok, or Greatsword Hurk. You want to play reactively, you pick Twin Sword Vella dancing with ease at the bosses attack patterns, or a sturdy shield maiden in Fiona. And there's still others who fall on both ends of the spectrum. Find the character you like, and stick with them till 40 to see if you like the game(follow AP guides early on so you don't get screwed later).- The character customization is also amazing. The armor sets can be mixed and matched however you want for the most part(be aware of set bonuses). There's an entire outfitter shop with all sorts of different hairstyles, tattoos, inner armors, etc. The bad part is that most of it costs a LOT of money. I'm talking $5 for a single head, armor, leg, glove, or boot customization, but for overall variety, and in such an old game engine, it certainly is vast and very customizable down to some of the colors of the armor pieces themselves.*-------------------------------------------------------------*- The bad:- The game is pretty much entirely peer to peer hosted, so whoever's the host needs good internet or no one can play properly. While not usually a problem with the earlier missions that only accompany up to 4 people, it gets a bit hairier with the 6 or 8 man raids, or when huge masses of mobs start spawning in and the host's computer can't keep up. On the flipside, it does allow people to play on other servers with friends if they live nearby with relatively low ping and consistency, so that's nice.- The game is VERY much a cash grab at this point. The only thing keeping it afloat are the whales, but most of them only stay simply because of the time invested through sunk cost fallacy. In a free to play game, the community needs to be alive enough for the game to be commercially successful, but eventually even the whales will quit eventually. It's been very sad seeing the community slowly dwindle over the years and now hardly seeing anyone in even the first 10 channels.- The game is poorly optimized. It's built off a very old engine from more than a decade ago, and rarely, if ever, reaches 60fps for even the best gaming rigs. Sure it looks pretty on higher settings, but the game is all about functionality. This can be improved by turning off UI elements(the buff indicators and their tooltips in particular are resource heavey due to their updating every single second, if you want better functionality for this game I'd recommend turning off any UI elements you deem unnecessary for the fight itself.) but will still have a few issues occasionally.- Progression in the game can be heavily RNG based. For earlier levels it doesn't matter that much for what weapons and other things you use as long as they're appropriately leveled. If you're an experienced player you can easily get to the late game within 20 hours of gameplay, especially when you know when to upgrade things, or just the weapon, etc, and how to play the game itself effectively. For new players, however, it can be very confusing and grindy when they try to farm for things they could just buy on the market for dirt cheap that's the correct level for progressing through the game. This is also a problem with the enhancing and enchanting systems in the game which can be seen here:http://vindictus.gamepedia.com/Item_Enhancementhttp://vindictus.gamepedia.com/Enchanting.This can make it hard to progress in the game after a certain threshold where it's required to be useful in any way during raids or other battles.- Nexon NA's support is ABYSMAL. The community mods are mostly just people ruling with an iron fist over anything that goes against their own preconceived biases, and Nexon has issues with fan made sites outside of their own forums or wiki. Dealing with the support team is mostly just rehashed, premade messages that get you nowhere.*-------------------------------------------------------------*The recent issue:The problem I have is with the built in security feature BlackCipher, which poorly summarized, works by testing the amount of RAM usage during your gameplay to detect abnormalities in gameplay to test for bots, and automatically adds ""points"". Once you reach a threshold you get auto banned. This also runs in the background and causes significant stuttering and lag for the actual game itself. The prime reason why I'm quitting now is because recently one of the most prominent community members, Sanitee, was banned due to his personally developed, and widely helpful Vindictus Inn site and database being marked as being a ""hack"" of sorts due to BlackCipher. This resulted in a permanent ban that he's tried to get uplifted to no avail, and which Nexon NA(or at least the minuscule amount of actual workers there) claims cannot be undone. In response, Shippuu(who's review can be seen nearby as well) has closed the other prominent fan site Vindictus Manual in retaliation and replaced it with a heartfelt message instead. These two key figures were widely regarded as some of the most helpful and experienced players, as well as prominent game developers devoting days of their time to making functioning websites for the entire community, and Nexon showed their true colors on how much they ""care"" regarding the issue, and the game itself. Because of this, I can't play this game in good conscience and refuse to spend more time playing a game that the developers(or at least Nexon rather than Devcat for the most part) care nothing about and which will die because of negligence. You might just get banned for no other reason than you forgot you overclocked your PC earlier out of nowhere, which is not okay in any online game. Nexon has entirely sweeped the incident under the rug out of sight of everything else as well.Overall, I'd say to try it until like level 40ish with whatever character you feel most comfortable with and see if you like it(better with friends), but understand that Nexon doesn't care even a little about anything, and you might be screwed later on down the line for no reason whatsoever, and many prominent people are leaving because of Nexon's negligence and disinterest.tl;dr : Gameplay++++, Customization+, Character Variety++Peer 2 Peer mostly--, Optimization--, Cash Grab--, RNG--, Nexon----------"

Many of the players that are still here can't leave because of time investment, money investment or friends. Not to say you shouldn't play this game if you have friends on it, just saying you shouldn't invest too much. Another reason the population is so low is because of false ban accusations by black cipher which has banned multiple innocent accounts and heavily invested players, so you could also get banned for having a non-harmful program running in the background. Vindictus is just like a crazy girlfriend, you better focus on her or she'll cut your♥♥♥♥♥♥off :).You have 2 chances. If you get falsey banned once and get it repealed, that's a strike against your account. If it happens again, you're perma banned regardless if it was legit or not. They don't care, they just want to be right and they refuse to change their policy on this and have now killed all fansites and many of my friends :D. I'm just sitting here patiently waiting to see if they do the same to me, since I'm a whale.The game is best known for its combat style and ""dress up simulator"" graphics aren't too bad for an old game either.Since the game is instance based this game relies on the player base to host parties to run missions. Frames (fps) are almost nonexistent here(maybe overexaggerated, but never fully 60fps). It's an old game and they don't do much to make the game run better on official servers.Aside from that, as a new player it is hard to gear up unless you have help from friends, dedicate alot of time or spend nx. If you don't mind the struggle then this is no big deal to you. I think with some heavy spending, it took me a month to hit ""end game"" gear. Aside from spending, farming for gold was difficult unless I had alot of time on my hands. Maybe 3hours+ for raids and farmable missions. Even then, it's all rng. Especially the part about getting banned :).The management for NA version of this game isn't looked to kindly by the community really. The management team doesn't seem to really care about anything relative to the game other than bug fixes and sales.Many of the players that do spend money on this game (and I mean like a hefty amount) have expressed their displeasure with how sales have been with this game. Each and every sale (mainly gachas) they have done nothing but just make the experience worse and not worth your money.At this point, to me, it just feels like they're milking the game as much as they can before it dies. For me I don't want to spend money only to see the game die sooner than necessary. Many of the days I'm on this game, I wonder if even we'll have everything that Korea's server has one day. But that won't happen because they change up alot of the things with the sales that korean's get in outfitter shop while we're stuck with a gacha. Then they tell us that ""oh, but this is how the koreans did it"" When it's clear BS. That's just one example that I could think of.As a player, having these kinds of occurences and views towards them...I wouldn't want anyone to be a part of that. A company that provides a service but doesn't really care if you're satisfied with the experience. Basically polite scamming and sometimes actual scamming with some of the sales they do. With all the feedback they've been given, they don't do anything really to fix it or please the people that pay or the casual people that do spend every now and then.Side note: I'm a collector, so I like to have multiple vanity and costumes that the game has to offer (only the ones I like). I started late so I didn't have everything from the beginning. I requested for them to bring back SQ as many other people seemed to have wanted too. They did. Another thing I really wanted for them to bring back was elchulus wings. They brought it back in a black friday gacha and nothing to exchange with so it was all rng. I rolled them, got costumes I already had so I had to throw them on alts, characters I don't even play. Wasted about $800 trying to get it on 2 different characters. Because they decided to limit the boxes to 10 purchases a day per account. Even having excess amount of outfitters they would not exchange them for the wings I had so desperately wanted and attempted to pay for. Which is something that REALLY set me off. Now I will forever hate nexon because of this experience."

Dont play this game at all, Im done with all of Nexon's products if this is how they treat their customers."
,Not Recommended,212160,29547727,Posted: 28 January,all,Toxic ADC,Nexon treats it's playerbase like garbage. They used to be able to get away with that in the Maplestory days because there weren't many other options. Now there are plenty of great games out and alot of them are F2P. Note to publishers and developers: you have to be very lucky in this day and age to treat your fanbase badly and get away with it.

It's really a gamble on trying to get  decent gear or items to sell to make gold. The influx of this game blows goats and it gets frustrating if an enchant or enhancement fails. You're taking chances on a game that's really just a cash cow. It's addicting at first, seeing how I dumped so many hours into it but I just want to give up again. Waiting around with your thumb up your♥♥♥♥♥for a raid to start or even trying to continue the storyline. You might as  well try Elsword or Dragon Nest if you want a fast-paced game where you have better luck."

At one point, the lighting/reflections in this game was the best I've seen. In fact, it rivalled AAA titles back in ~2010 when DX11 was uncommon.Music.Music is great, some of the best instrumentals I've heard. When I quit this game, I'll be listening to the OST into the far future for sure.Reasonably bugfree.Bug fixes may a take a while, but they eventually arrive.The bad:FPS and Client/Server instability.It is impossible to have a solid 60 FPS and the game crashes for no reason. Optimization is urgently needed but that appears to be low priority. The crashes are few and far between, but it is worth mentioning. The anticheat software is unreliable as proven by the abundancy of bots and for some reason it occassionally uses all of your CPU.Nexon NA.Official forums are heavily moderated. Seemingly normal posts get deleted because of ""FUD"" (fear, uncertainty and doubt). The definition of this appears to depend on the weather. I heard the anticheat software can trigger false positives, which means players can get permanently banned for no reason.Somewhat pay2win/pay2progress.You can obtain almost everything for free if you grind enough, but real money helps a lot. The game has high upkeep if you want some of the nicer things such as hair and extra inventory space.So, after about 10000 hours I'll probably play in a different region, quit Vindictus or quit MMORPGs entirely. At the end of the day, the game is good if you want to bash some monsters into the ground. But is the combat good enough to make people stay? Give it a shot, I somehow played this game for 10000 hours while hating it the entire time."

The absolute hatred and disgust they show towards anyone not like them is quickly and readily apparent. The executives are truly abhorrent human beings.There's nothing really much else to say. Vindictus is doomed to be a sour experience for you from the infectous touch of Nexon NA. If the gameplay looks appealing, try to find a guest pass for Black Desert Online--the gameplay is very similar and will scratch the same itch for most people, and has a lot more to offer overall."

It's important to keep that in mind throughout the rest of the review since I'll be wording things from a Casual player's perspective.THE GOOD• Great, shiny graphics (but due to its age, don't expect to be blown away).• Very solid, satisfying melee combat, second to none that I've seen. You can almost feel each hit, each slice, each stab.• The characters are numerous and play differently, making for great replayability.• Raids are so much funTHE BAD• Graphics can be overproduced at times, leading so slow performance even with a good PC• Lower-level quests are mind-numbingly dull with the same trash mobs over and over, in the same rooms over and over (only in lower levels)• The story content  is not worth the amount of time you'll spend walking back and forth in town between NPCs (only in lower levels)• player base seems to be shrinking at an alarming rate. Only Veterans seem to log in anymoreTHE IMPORTANT NOTEThe next fact is neither Good nor Bad: There is a large range between Casual and Veteran players. This is understandable; Casuals don't want to put in all the time to get the best gear, and Veterans do not want to Raid with dead-weight. For the latest and most stat-heavy content, you will likely not be welcomed onto a Veteran boat if you are not a Veteran. However, Veterans are more than happy to Raid with you on older content.Nexon has made many improvements to the game since I started playing. Story-based drops are now guaranteed, you can purchase rare materials with Seals (gained over time doing Raids) and different difficulties are available for each Raid to tailor to your skill level and equipment. Content-wise, the game is at it's best right now.However, since the Steam Recommendation is based on whether or not I'd suggest it to new players, the answer is No. The lower-level grind is too dull, and the small player base may be indicative of a Conclusion sometime soon.That being said, I'll continue to play it as a filthy Casual. :)"
