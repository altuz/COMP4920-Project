It's not that this is a bad game, it's just that you've played it before. If you enjoyed Gears of War you'll get on well with this, as its gameplay is mostly identical. The gravity mechanic is a nice idea but I found myself mostly forgetting to use it, and even when I remembered I didn't feel it added enough to the game to set it apart. It's a fairly standard cover shooter, reasonably well executed, though with an ending you've seen a million times in other games that you can see coming a mile away. I found myself rushing through it after a few chapters in but I don't regret playing through it."
,Recommended,212410,13535037,"Posted: 22 December, 2014",all,ownosourus,"Inversion is a cover-based third-person shooter from Saber studios, creator of 2007’s Timeshift. Knowing this you can expect a decent shooter.The story sees you play as cop Davis Russell, who along with his partner Leo Deglado, is in the midst of an alien invasion and looking to find Davis’ daughter. Set in the near future, an unknown army of evil enemies called the Lutadores have invaded the Earth and as Davis you struggle to battle this enemy through a rubble-strewn world where Gravity is not always as simple as being up and down.The character design and overall look and feel of the game is pretty good. The enemy have been designed to have a humanoid looking appearance but the language they speak indicates they are not a local enemy and could be from another planet.  Amongst this enemy you have your standard grunts and varying classes of enemy, including bosses.The difficulty of the game is something that really needs to be addressed before I talk more about the game. From the off, Inversion has 3 difficult settings, Low Gravity (easy), Normal Gravity (normal) and High Gravity (hard). If you are tough enough to complete the High Gravity setting you will unlock Black Hole gravity, however this does not have any achievements or trophies attributed to completing it.While the difficulty varies throughout the game, the levels are very linear, as you are guided from A to B of each checkpoint. There are no collectibles and no real exploration needed and this is a bit disappointing for a current gen game when compared to other shooters on the market.As you travel through each level you are accompanied by Leo. Players have the option to buddy up and use Leo as a multiplayer co-op experience, which is highly recommended, because the AI on this game is awful.The Unique selling point of the gravity shift has both a positive and negative impact on the game. There are sections of the game where you encounter gravity shifts that turn the environment upside down or on its side. This sounds like a novel addition to an FPS, but it does little to change the gaming experience, because you are doing the exact same thing you were doing a minute ago on the ground.The positives to the single player campaign though, and the most notable, is the zero gravity segments where gravity has been lost and you float through the environment using cars and rocks that have been left hanging in the air as cover against the enemy.You are able to reverse gravity and send enemies to their knees, which is great, but again does not offer very much. The other option that this low gravity ability has, is that it gives you a shield. Again, this can be very handy in those parts of the game that Saber have decided to make extremely difficult for no reason.With the solo campaign all covered, it would be remiss if I didn’t talk about the multiplayer aspect of this game. The matchmaking menu and options are great, with a huge amount of variety that players would expect to see in an FPS multiplayer, such as capture the flag, death match, team death match.It is a shame that with the wide variety and huge amount of challenges to complete in multiplayer, such as weapon and match type challenges that the matchmaking system was awful in allocating me a party.In summary, Inversion is a pretty good shooter that is worth being looked at by any fan of the genre. It is an enjoyable playthrough but not something that screams for a repeat performance."

I guess its cause the Co Op and Multiplayer doesn't work but as a single player game, its fine. It has everything a third person shooter needs. It has a good story, good weapons, amazing graphics and is actually quite challenging. Its longer then an average shooter but it is still shorter then I'd like. The main characters are a bit bland and the story left with a ton of mystery but leave it to Namco to have amazing cutscenes. Probably some of the best Cutscenes I've ever seen since Lost Planet. Although the game does crash at times. Plus the bot partner is smarter then most as he does actualy fight and use gravity weapons and your not constantly having to save him. Still, he doesn't use any other weapons then the ones assigned to him. This is a great game for 3 bucks and I think more people should enjoy it for its single player content. I was planning on playing it that way anyway so I don't care about co op or multiplayer. The game is good and a lot of fun."

The game emphasize co-op play with another player. if you don't have another player, you'll basically be soloing with a cpu partner. You don't technically have to baby sit your partner, you will though have to do majority of the work in certain scenarios. Your partner basically feels like a diversion for enemies, so they wont always focus their fire on you, which gives you enough time to inflict as much damage as you can on them to stop their relentless onslaughts of fire.You will die a lot! in some cases i've encounter situations where i would get hit and instantly die because of how chaotic the combat can be, not sure if that's intentional. The story is worth♥♥♥♥♥♥and im a story man. Supposedly earth is invaded by aliens, who basically look like ♥♥♥♥ing humans from the stone age era. how they get this advance technology who knows. character design is just down right low budget tier. i like the graphics in certain parts of the time. in other parts you'll get that flat blurry texture that was all too common of last gen.I'll say this game only redeeming factor is its combat. I love cover base shooters and cover base mechanics and this game has that. killing enemies can be semi satisfying. You'll hear a nice crack when you nail that head shot. i love games that does head shot dismemberment's.All and all this game is worth it when its on sale, which most of the time is 75% off. black out the crappy story and focus on gameplay, as annoying is it may be.

The areas where you do battle in this game are for the most part,interesting and varied. The game really has a world that gives off an invasion-like atmosphere.+StoryThe story is what I really loved about this game. It may not be the best but it sure as hell got me interested in what was going to happen next.You play as a cop named David Russell with your partner Leo Deglato.The game is set during an invasion of your home,Vanguard City,by a race of gibberish-speaking humanoids called the lutadores. They are brutal savages and this is apparent very quickly as they begin to mow down every civilian in sight.You and Leo begin a long quest to try and find your daughter in a city filled with savages.+KillsThis game has incredibly satisfying kills. You may shoot a guy in the head and his head will explode with a satisfying sound. You might shoot a behemoth with a rocket and have him explode into a shower of blood,leaving limbs and blood everywhere.Cons-AIThe AI in this game is awful. Leo's AI is completely incapable of covering you and I'm not even sure he actually deals damage. The enemy AI is to run to cover and shoot. No flanking or anything they just get to cover and shoot until they die.-GameplayBoy this is one hell of a bland game.Early on you get a weapon called the grav-link which allows you to use low grav abilities like making enemies fly out of cover or even picking up and throwing objects like rocks. At different scripted points in the game you can get upgrades for this such as being able to use high grav abilities that can pull enemies to the ground or apply a shield. There are also points in the game where you fight in no gravity zones using different objects(Cars and Rocks)as cover. This may sound cool but is no different from being on the ground as the game plays exactly the same.-CrashesThroughout my playthrough this game crashes almost 20 times. This game will randomly crash during cutscenes and loading screens. The game is also very linear and runs on checkpoints so this could end up setting you back a bit.-DifficultyThis game is typically pretty easy. There is 3 difficulty modes,High Gravity,Low Gravity,and Normal Gravity. However there are a few ""boss fight"" type encounters like with enemies called slave drivers and with a couple kinds of mechs.The game gets incredibly hard during some of these boss encounters such as the slave drivers and will require multiple tries and perseverance to get through.If you found this review helpful or entertaining then feel free to leave a comment and join my Steam Curator Group atMudkips Gaming"

,Recommended,212410,111197,"Posted: 20 December, 2012",all,your evil twin,"A suprisingly good game. Some critics have dismissed Inversion as a Gears of War rip-off, and while it does have some obvious similarities I found that I enjoyed Inversion far more!The story starts like a typical invasion story, but it actually has some crazy twists and becomes pretty interesting. I found myself compelled to keep playing to find out who the mysterious bad guys were and where they came from, and the answer did not disappoint. The game has colourful environments rather than being all grey or brown, and there is an impressive amount of attention to detail in the level design. The two heroes are much more likeable than the guys in GOW; they are tough guys but they are not cartoonish macho thugs, they are horrified by what is going on around them. I especially liked the player's partner Leo, who is very crass and vulgar but actually quite smart and the one who tries to figure out what is really going on. It also helps that in singleplayer your partner has excellent AI and is always a help rather than a hiderence.The gameplay is a pretty competent cover-based third-person-shooter, but with a bunch of nice extra features. Inversion has impressive ""Havok Destruction"" physics that mean sustained fire will smash cover to pieces, so you have to keep moving rather than hide in one spot. There are fun bits where you are floating around in zero gravity or where walls or ceilings become the floor, which spices things up nicely.Early in the game you aquire the Gravlink device and get special gravity powers. In the tutorial section you get to try out several abilities, but then this power is snatched away from you and you get a basic version that just lets you use Low Gravity to make objects and people float into the air.Floating enemies take several seconds to adjust to their new situation before they resume shooting at you, and of course they are nice easy targets. The game includes typical red explosive barrels, but there are also yellow barrels that do nothing except leak when shot; however using low gravity on a yellow barrel will create a floating spherical blob of flammable liquid. You can also do a gravity shockwave attack that tears enemies to pieces, it's much better than a normal melee attack as it can kill multiple enemies, has a range of a couple of meters, and it can penetrate cover.You gain more powers by killing bosses and taking components from their Gravlinks. You'll get the ability to grab or throw objects like Half-Life L2's gravity gun... in fact, it can even throw enemies at each other, so it is like the Super Gravity Gun that you get at the end of HL2! To prevent this from being ludicrously overpowered, so you can only grab and throw things that you have first made float using your zero gravity ability, but since you can make entire groups of enemies and objects float with just one or two low gravity blasts this is not a big inconvenience. Later you get an upgrade that allows you to throw huge objects like cars. It is especially important to remember this ability in tough fights; killing a giant boss enemy with an assault rifle takes an absurd amount of time, throwing objects at bosses is far more effective.Later in the game you get High Gravity. You can use it on structures like guard towers and bridges to cause them to collapse, and you can cause hanging objects to fall to create cover. High Gravity pins tough enemies to the ground and make them helpless, while weaker enemies will be splatted against the floor and instantly killed. While in High Gravity mode your ability to grab and throw objects is replaced with a very effective defensive shield. The shield is essential for surviving battles in the last third of the game, and you have to get good at managing your energy so you can protect yourself and also have enough energy to do gravity attacks on enemies.One criticism I have is that Inversion has a rather absurd number of cutscenes, like Max Payne 3 or Metal Gear Solid. You can skip them if you want to, though I recommend watching them otherwise you might miss an importatant plot point. (And in any case they were entertaining most of the time.)This game is about messing with gravity, and I recommend that you do it constantly. If you just rely on your guns then it will seem like a pretty typical shooter, but the real fun comes from using your powers as often as possible. It is immensely satisfying causing a sniper to float out of cover, sucking him towards you and then punching his head off. Or running into the middle of a group of enemies, and just before being killed you do a ground shockwave attack and cause the entire group to explode into gory pieces. Ludicrous gibs = ludicrous fun."

I got the game when it was on sale and finished it  in 26 hours on hard difficulty. In the end it did not feel rewarding or satisfying at all.If you've seen any trailers for Inversion then you may be excited to try out the gravity inverting gameplay that was the main selling point of the game. Indeed you can have some fun with it. But it does not last long at all. It works well in the introductory stages of the game.The first 2 or 3 areas are actually somewhat well designed and exciting even. However the fun ends as suddenly as it starts. You will keep expecting and waiting for ""something"" to start, for some kind of exposition. Instead you will be treated with a lot of the same. After the areas that were paid attention to Inversion almost changes direction and feels like either different people picked up the game 1/3 in and had to quickly finish it and patch it up. If not that, then it definitely feels like a lot of the same on and on.Some action sequences and area segments are just atrocious. But besides the level design and the misleading story you will also immediately feel like you have played this game before. It borrows so much and so liberally from other games that it is not even funny as a homage. It is visible in the enemies design, in the crouching behind cover mechanic, in the sound effects, and in the plot itself.It is difficult to add anything substantial without spoiling the game, even though there is not much to spoil, but if you can skip it, I would skip it. If you had already decided to skip it, then take a look at the story cutscenes or reviews on YouTube to get an idea."

Slap a new story, characters and assets onto it, with your own proprietary engine and you've got Inversion.And I'm not kidding, this game almost MIRRORS Gears of War down to every detail; the weapon selection system, movement, combat, some of the interface design, weapon functionality (an example being that grenades show you where they'll land, just little things like that), weapons, some of the enemies, cover system and essentially even Locust holes, even requiring a grenade to ""close"" them up.I primarily bought this game out of technical interest, seeing as it used the same engine as TimeShift and their latest game, God Mode. But other than some odd curiosity, I can't recommend this at all as something to have great fun playing through as the game remains repetitive and the story dull.It's also worth mentioning that I found the dialogue incredibly difficult to hear, as the audio system seems to add some really awful sounding echo in some places and the default sound levels tend to cause the music and other audio to muffle it. It's a good idea to turn both the music and SFX volumes down about half-way before proceeding to play, from my personal experience anyway."

If you've played Gears of War, that is pretty much exactly what the combat is. The gravity manipulation is a pretty fun and neat twist which can open up the path to progression and pull enemies out from cover. The cover is also destructable, so you (and the enemies) can't hide behind it forever.The big issue is the design of the overall game. Here is how an early part goes: [Cutscene], you walk down the street, [Cutscene], you turn the corner [Cutscene], you kill two guys [Cutscene]. For the hour and a half to two hours I've played, that is how the whole thing has been. Well, I say ""played"", but a lot of that was watching cutscenes. I'm not one of those people who hates cutscenes and thinks that they should not exist, but this game can not go more than [literally] five minutes without one. I will say that they ARE skippable, but even then, having to skip one every few minutes is annoying and to the point where I've given up on the game. Maybe down the road I'll give it another shot, and maybe further in they let you play for more than 5 minutes at a time, but for now I'm moving on."

It uses the Gear of War approach to cover based combat, 2 gun, melee, and companion AI gameplay.So basically it is a Gears of War knock off with Gravity effects.  It is not a bad game at 7-8 hours to beat but it is also not a good game.  You can tell the creators wanted to make an awesome game, but likely had someone breathing down their neck to make a Gears of War style game and ultimately it suffered into somewhat busted game.You can see they wanted to make itt more of an emotional, physics, gravity, and teamplay game... but somewhere it was ruined by making it a cover based shooter with cheap death tactics.  Not a difficult game but it did cheat me a few times with glitches and instead death I could not control.Not bad - only recommend if you like Gears of War gameplay and you want to play its less interesting cousin."

The main selling point is the gravity based weapon but it just feels like a crappy, awkward to use knock off of Half Life 2's gravity gun. For most of the game it is easier to just shoot people then you get to the boss fights were you are forced to use the disproportionately overpowered gravity weapon and it can get really frustrating.

The progression of the story is very well done even if the dialogue is a bit cheesy, and the storyline itself is surprisingly original and feeds you a little at a time, to keep you interested.

The story is pretty good for a shooter, except the end which is a bit disappointing. The controls are fine (if you rebind ""mini zoom"" to right click, as it should be), voices and sounds are ok, and graphics are decent. No performance problems (Windows 8.1, GTX 760, i5 4670k and 8 GB of RAM) and no bugs for me (except ... see next sentence).Here are the not so good things : totally linear ... starting around the middle of the game, it has a tendancy to CTD when reloading a checkpoint ... some annoying ""boss"" fights, especially towards the end, enemy variety rather low, and (if you're after such things) no trading cards and no achievements.It took me around 10 hours to finish it, without rushing too much (there's not much else to do than follow the path, anyway), but what matters to me is that I had fun playing it, and that's all I expect of a game.No reason not recommend it then, I'd rate it at 7/10 taking into account its current price (around 10€).

From its story, setting and characters, to it's pop-n-shoot gameplay, you will be constantly reminded of Epic's opus in grey-and-brown. It's only in the very last 10% of the game that Inversion finally starts to develop a personality of its own.But for all that they blatantly stole so much from Gears, the developers failed to take the one thing that really mattered; interesting gameplay. And let's face it; Gears of War barely qualifies as interesting itself, so you know Inversion has to be  scraping the barrel if they can't even match the pedantic gameplay of Gears. The game has horrible controls (not that surprising in a port but disappointing nonetheless).  Its enemies and levels are hardly notable and its gunplay is bog-standard. The hook to Inversion is its ability to play around with the gravitational field, but nothing Inversion does is new or memorable. And, oh god is this game in love with its cut-scenes; it seems almost every action you take triggers a scripted - and uninterruptible -  animation.On the plus side, there's some nice destructibility of the environments and the graphics are passable, especially consider it is a multi-platform title.

I don't understand why developers think jump/crouch/sprint/cover should all be on the same button when they're all separate actions that are essentially opposed to each other.  The gravity mechanic would be better if using it to manipulate things didn't cause those things to block your view (thus making it unnecessarily difficult, bordering on impossible, to actually make effective use of the manipulated items).  It also suffers from the cut-scene/click a couple of times/cut-scene/move 10 feet/cut-scene/etc. problem.  To call this a game doesn't seem accurate to me - it's really just a compiled annoyance."

Its sooo bad that its good. Best to play late at night when you are teetering on the verge of laughing at any little thing, and with a friend via co-op (although if you can figure out how to do that easily in this game, then its not late enough at night)Typical gameplay goes like this:  Combat for 30 seconds, then a 30 second cut scene. Then a movement stage of going from A to B for 20 seconds, then a 20 second cut scene. Then combat for 30 seconds... and the cycle repeats. Gameplay is interupted so much by cutscenes that it starts to get hilarious.This is also one of those games where they put co-op type quicktime events in for no good reason. Oh look, a ledge, your buddy has to help you up, then you pull him up. Or having to hit ""F"" just to drop off a 4 foot ledge. Its just a speed bump in gameplay that serves no purpose, other than delaying how long it takes to see the next cut scene.Speaking of cutscenes (and dialog), think Resident Evil 1. Its only a bit better, but every bit as funny. Some great moments: Walking down the street as a tricycle slowly comes rolling down the street towards us and my character says, ""What the hell is that?"" followed by the other character saying, ""Where the hell did they get that?"" It was just good timing, because they obviously werent talking about the tricycle, but it made for a hilarious situation. Expect laughable dialog such as ""Stay tight, we've never been in this deep before"" and ""I guess this is where we go our seperate ways"" from 2 cop buddies who have been through hell, and just gotten past a tough part. You find yourself saying, ""Whaaa???"" outloud a lot while playing.One note: This game has a tendency to instant crash to desktop after any cutscene. Being that there are so many frequent cutscenes, it can be frustrating. Setting the exe to winXP compatability mode seems to help reduce it.My son and I had more fun playing the game like we were watching a video from Birgirpall (look it up on youtube, you will understand), than if we actually tried to play it seriously.

Actually, I don't think I have done any.For this game, I will make an exception.  While the game does have an interesting story, the voice acting and script is pretty horrible.  In addition, you don't really even like the characters.  The other promising part is the interesting concept of rotating gravity.  Unfortunately, all it provides is a promise... that it doesn't keep.So much for the positives.  The action is completely repetitive, especially when it comes down to the boss fights.  Most of the game is casual, but then you come to boss fights later in the game where the difficulty skyrockets to levels that don't even make sense.  It would be different if the difficulty was due to requiring skill, but instead if you basically just hvae to figure out which stupid strategy is going to be required.  Is it going to be spamming lava balls?  Is it going to be running like a decapitated chicken to keep distance?  Is it reviving your somehow previously useful teammate constantly?  Either way, it is more an annoyance than some accomplishment.Holy crap I almost forgot the cutscenes!  I have never seen so many of them in a game... ever.  And it isn't just to give the story, it is just to show you repeating the same teamwork to get over a wall sometimes.  I would say that over half the actually game was watching cutscense, with some just 30 seconds apart.  Some game designers have come up with ways to focus your attention on action/story without pulling you out of the game to watch a movie.  This game apparently wants you to watch their movie while occasionally participating in moronic boss battles and repetitive enemies.This game is a rip off of Gears of War for the cover, HL2 for the gravity gun, and SATs for repetitive misery.  Can you find some enjoyable moments?  Yes.  Will you spend most of your time cursing the crappy controls, cover mechanics, inconsistant difficulty and insane amount of cutscenes?  Yuuuuuuup"

But why not four as other games with similar play styles allow?3rd person shooters aren't an attractive style for me but at least two others that proved awesome, and still are, are in this genre & I thought I may be growing as a gamer. It was just a bit weak in range of motion, expected level progression, weapon usage, etc.One small thing is the fact that one facet of the game took me 20 minutes to figure out. A simple button push. Not sure if I was tired that day or what but it must've been a control-tip I missed or it's something everyone would 'just figured out,' but being in a cave trying to manipulate things with the powers of anti-grav should've been intuitive. Maybe it's just me.Games looks pretty. It's a gritty terrain you must navigate. The story was starting to get interesting, partially, & yet my interest waned enough for me to 'uninstall' it.

,Recommended,212410,13678227,"Posted: 28 December, 2014",all,theblackdragonkills,I have no idea why this game is not higher rated! 1st DO NOT BELIVE THE PEOPLE WHO SAY THIS DOES NOT HAVE CO-OP! YES IT 100% Does! You only can do local co-op though on the same network. (Which for me is fine cuz I just have my friends come over) The story is really good the graphics are ok but the level designes are amazing! Its a ton of fun. There are 13 levels. I'm currently on Level 10 and played about 8hrs to get through 9 levels. SO 4 more levels left I'd say about a 12-14hr game. Not bad if you ask me. I can't belive this game is only $2.50! You gota pick this game up its deffenatly worth it. I feel the game is well balanced playing co-op I've died 1x every 30min about which I think is well balanced cuz if you dont die then its to easy of a game and not challenging. Some parts are really overly hard though and I do feel they could of been tamed a bit. If you know what downsampling is Deffenatly do that in this game as it will look 10x better if you do theres very little AA so Downsampling workings very well.

For starters, it failed the two hour test --that is, when I play a game, I give it 2 hours to either entertain me or interest me. It did neither.From the perspective of someone who's only played a couple of hours, I couldn't push myself to care. The story was bland, and there were more than a few groan-worthy moments within the first ten minutes. Characters came off quite generic, enemies seemed dull, and the gravity mechanic just didn't entice me. The only saving grace for this game is playing the story in co-op, because it might be fun to make fun of its generic-ness, but I don't know. With Gamespy closed, supposedly you can find a way to get online co-op to work, but I haven't tried yet.Just... just a avoid it. There's so much else that deserves your money out there."
,Recommended,212410,14814689,"Posted: 9 March, 2015",all,Kyrii,"This is a rather mixed bag, so I'll throw the bad out first.The co-op is forever broken due to gamespy shutting down, and the story and characters are so laughably bad it's almost worth checking out as a joke. Also, it's overloaded with gameplay-intruding cutscenes that could have played out better if control wasn't wrestled from the players hands and the actual quality of this console-port shows for itself on the main menu. But honestly, I've seen far-worse ports. So I should probably count my blessings they gave me keyboard prompts.However, the gameplay itself showcases some suprisingly meaty gunplay and titillating destruction that kept me playing. While invisible walls are cumbersome and the overal design implying this was entirely meant to be played in co-op kept rearing their ugly heads, I still pressed on for the next messy firefight, even if some boss-fights repeated themselves after the 4-hour mark.Inversion is an interesting Almagam of multiple other games (HL2 and GoW come to mind), but it does more good then bad, and for a low price, it's still fun to play on a dreary weekend or days-off from work, where you just want to hurl cars at big, muscle-bound barbarians and watch them explode into juicy lamb-chops.Inversion is really dumb, and there are many games out there with a better story and longer running time with a lot less hectic and silly story to keep things going until the finish line, but it's still fun for what it is.If you are still skeptical, wait for it go on sale for an even lower price :)"
,Not Recommended,212410,14924548,"Posted: 16 March, 2015",all,Swift Sushi,"TL:DR; Average game. Would not recommend.Storyline -Standard save the world/family. Semi-decent twists. Biggest let down is that you play 90% of the game as a memory of the MC.I almost loved the story for how bleak the ending was. Daughter wound up dead anyway,and the father bites the dust as well. However, D wound up living, which kind of took out the impact of the ending for me. Since there wasn't a sequel or any additional lore (as far as I know), it suddenly feels unfinished. The whole dome-worlds thing was a bit of a slap to the face. I probably didn't spot any clues, but I caught zero foreshadowing the whole ""we're not on earth"" deal.Gameplay -Overall bland. While the gravity manipulation is nifty, you really forget it's there until you fight a boss/snipers that demand its use to progress. It wasn't until the final two chapters that I actually started using the gravity abilities, as that's when I started having trouble with ammo conservation. *Played on highest difficulty setting*Visuals -The graphics were good for a somewhat aged game. The way the game moved (gameplay and cutscenes) made it feel like I was at an Arcade playing Inversion. I do appreciate that.Bonus Points -Mother ♥♥♥♥ing PAUSE BUTTON during cutscenes! Yes. Learn from this, games that are 90% cutscenes and 10% actual gameplay. Learn from it.Overall, I wouldn't recommend Inversion.I really had to push myself to finish this game after putting it on hold for 2 months or so.I'm happy to have finished the story, but I simply could not see myself playing this a second time."

I played it Co-op with a friend before the whole Gamespy fiasco and had a blast with it. I even bought it for another friend so that could play. Unfortunately, I hear now that the co-op does not work anymore. Which is a real shame. This game was hidden Gem for me. Hopefully there is a solution somewhere out there to fix CO-op."

Look, if you like this kind of game, get it on sale, you won't regret it. Using the power of gravity to kill enemies by crushing them with the corpses of other enemies is worth the three bucks I paid. That's all I'm saying."

Enter the game with the right mindframe, and you will LOVE IT.60 FPS makes the difference.I played the game on the xbox, and dealt with its flaws, ALL the time wishing it was smoother and Blah blah, but I just couldnt finish it, so it sits in a box. That said, I purchased it here on steam, and I love it. the graphics are awesome, and its smoothness adds to the gameplay, and the story and details drive the experience home.I HAVE DISTINCT ISSUES WITH THE GAME. Serious misssteps.-Online only co-op and versus-no split screen (co op or versus)-no bots to play against to practice (in case the servers are off and you would be stuck with half a game)But as a Singleplayer romp, its a great game.Inversion is the kind of game that had plenty of great Ideas, but because of its gears of war mechanics, the gravity sections which could have been awesome, seem like gimmicks (for the story), which makes it a regular Third person affair.If you like shooters, and love razor sharp 60 fps graphics, with a TV series style storyline (which you will try to follow to the end, which I havent beaten it yet, but I savor every bit of good TV dialogue, and good TV acting) you will enjoy it a lot.4 GB download, an it serves its purpose. I hope people buy it. but dont buy it hoping for multiplayer. this would only be good for that if you had a bunch of friends. but then again, other games do it better. they should have just added split screen, because not everyone would ever play this at the same time.All in all, the game is well built, well designed, and the COD of GOW. LMAO. OMFG.Scratch that last part, its just a good game, you will not be disappointed. definitely a sunday/rainy day game."

At first it's the weak (Low Gravity) only allowing you to lift small things, but also enemies to drag them out of cover. Later you can throw cars and charge up using a classic ""Finger of Death"" ability on enemies which instagib them. You can also throw lava...Last upgrade being ""High Gravity"" allow you to make everything much more heavy. Enemies will be pushed to the ground, or groups can be insta gibbed after you ""Low"" lifted them from the ground and then ""High"" smash them into the floor turning them into a mighty puddle of goo.Last but not least, the gravity is major in many areas allowing you to walk on walls, ceilings or fly through the air. It's like space floating just with breathable air and sound :PThe story is also quite interesting, and is a big twist compared to most games. I was sceptical with the game being released from Namco, but the game is overall a good experience."

The story is not (how it is played out) very appealing. You don't really get to feel his emotions, as you play his character.The game also feature's a gravity ""weapon"" tool. Which in it self is not completely new, e.g Half Life 2. But at least then you could use it in a way you wanted. In this game it feels very linear and restricted. The music is not memorable. And nothing of any really fitted sountrack.The game's mechanics are weird. A pistol has the accuracy of a assualt rifle, and rifles the acc of a sniper rifle. It feels wrong. Even shotguns have no to limited spread. And the acc of a assualt rifle.The game nothing but mediocre. A score out of 10, I give this game 5.5/10"

The damn thing crashes everytime you die. Unless you wait a few moments before clicking the continue. The controls are... odd. They will take some time getting use to. Your going to want to switch a few things around. Options for resolution settings crap, and window mode your going to have to get creative.
