,Recommended,212500,29765295,Posted: 7 February,all,Sartor Resartus,"First major concern a lot of people have about LOTRO - is it dead?No. It still has a very healthy playerbase, big enough that the even the RP servers feel populated. So don't let your worries about population turn you away.This is a classic MMORPG. It's going to be familiar to anyone that has played Everquest, DAoC, WoW, etc. While it means you're not getting any particularly amazing new mechanics, the perk is that LOTRO has figured out how to get the best out of those systems. Leveling feels well-progressed, classes are (mostly) balanced, and there is a lot of variety even within the classes to provide lots of replay value and ways to mitigate strengths and weaknesses.LOTRO might have the best soundtrack I've ever heard. I recommend turning off battle music and just enjoying the compositions. Bree, as well as the various Inns and Halls located therein, have some fantastic scores attached to them.Let's be honest though - if you play LOTRO you're probably here because it's Lord of the Rings. And in that regard, you will not be disappointed. The game is steeped in the lore - books and films - and has little nods to it scattered everywhere that are rewarding for someone that is really into their Tolkien scholarship. This is not a LotR skin thrown over a MMORPG framework - this is Middle Earth proper. Even with dated graphics (updates are coming soon, as of this writing) it's still a joy to look at. If you're rolling through some place like the Shire, you'll be able to soak in that sleepy, bucolic atmosphere that the movies portrayed so well.This is a great MMO experience, and I usually find MMOs tedious. Moreover, it's free - so your excuses to at least try it out are non-existent."

Its so good. You can either play by hand or use .abc & .midi files to play instruments in game!CONS:Quests are boring if you dont read the quest text, They seem to have no point unless you dive into the storyDifficult to start if your not a ""VIP"" member.

Music is really chill, the world and art is beautiful and the gameplay is fairly easy going.My only complaint about it is that after so many years, it can get a little repetitive but that's mostly my fault for playing it so much. There is quite a bit of grinding involved, but it's mostly enjoyable and there's so much variety in the game that you can change gears all the time and keep yourself engaged in countless activities."
,Recommended,212500,30050655,Posted: 19 February,all,CosmicSloth,"In recent reviews, people have complaints about long installation times, trouble with registering, and not being able to play the game. For me, this was not the case. I don't have a powerful rig (and also not the best wifi), and I downloaded this game in under an hour. With quick account registration and patches installed, I was soon on my way to explore Middle Earth.As for the game itself, for being almost 10 years old, it's incredible. As a fan of Tolkien, it's astonishing to run into iconic landscapes and characters. The game is beautiful for being 10 years old, and you don't need a high performancing PC to run it. There's a main quest line that follows the books and plenty of interesting side quests. Combat is fun and engaging for a tab target MMORPG. The music, oh the music. If you're a fan of the Lord of the Rings film scores, then you'll love the music in game. There's nothing more enjoyable than the ear-gasm of riding into Rohan and hearing the sweet sound of violins accompaning your journey.On the contrary, the game can become a bit grindy. Lower level quests can become quite repeditive with the feeling of ""kill 10 spiders and collect 5 bear hides.,"" can be a bit overwhelming. I know. I've almost stopped playing again because of it. But, if you pick an advanced and interesting class, it can be less mind numbing. At the time of writting this review, I have a level 20 Warden and quests are becoming more engaging. Skirmishes, epic battles, and instances are a great break from these grindy experiences, and epic battles are available at low levels.As for the F2P model, it's one of the best ones available. It's incredibly fair and there really isn't any P2W instances. Some higher level quests and expansions require LOTRO points, but these points can be acquired in game (if you're up for some serious grinding). Most of the equipment found in the LOTRO store are cosmetics, mounts, and chracter boosts. I started out as a F2P player, but fell in love with the game, and became a VIP member, spending some money on additional LOTRO Points.So download the game. If you don't like it, then all you have done is wasted a bit of your time. It's free to play people. With another expansion coming out this year and another playable race, download it now and enjoy an authentic Middle Earth experience."

If you enjoy MMO's and you like Lord of the Rings, you will love this game! The main story ties in well with the story from the books and you play as a character helping out from behind the scenes. I haven't played too much so far, but i'm invested in the game and expect to be playing it for a very long time!

It's a great game to play with friends or also alone. It's free-to-play but there is content blocked by a pay wall. Technically, you can get past the pay wall by just playing the game but it's a monotonous grind. I listen to the ""LOTRO Podcast"" while playing this game and it's really relaxing. Overall, highly recommended."

With a free 105 level-up included with every Mordor expansion bundle now is the perfect time to give LotRO a try. Outstanding solo content, group patch coming this winter.ORIGINAL REVIEW BELOWPut it simple: the best MMORPG out there.It's big. What do you think is big? WoW? Check this. If you pay attention, you'll notice that any other MMORPG uses either corridor-like locations, with view always blocked by mountains, trees, buildings etc., or dramatically low draw distance, or both. Well, LotRO draws enormously vast locations with honest draw distance - not GTA V, but nothing like you've seen in MMORPG before. (The Crew was later). When you're in the fields of Rohan, you feel exactly why it is the land of horseriders.It's authentic. I play this game for 7 years and still I stop and gaze in awe at dwarf lords sculptures in Moria. Still I take screenshots of The Shire. Still I find dozens of new landscape details. This world is handcrafted by the indigenous inhabitants of Middle-Earth - piece by piece, tree by tree, bush by bush.It's homely. LotRO officially has the best or one of the best communities in online games.You know, I can go down to the basic mechanics, the classes (see in comments), the raids, the PvP, the unique mechanics like Legendary Weapons and Mounted Combat, but you know what? It's boring. Every game has mechanics, classes, balance and lots of people whine there's no balance. But this game is special. It has... it IS The Middle-Earth. If this means nothing to you, just pass by. You will like it, or dislike it, nothing I can change. But if you love Middle-Earth as I do, or if you are ready to fall in love with it, then we shall meet in White City, one day.Over 4000 hours /played on Russian servers before they were shut down."

Lotro is right behind WoW and Everquest in long time popularity. For good reasons. The community loves Tolkiens world and they treat eachother with respect and open arms. The most important game in my long history of gaming - an MMO legend you should not miss if you are interested in Middle Earth and its tales. What Peter JAckson did for the books in the movie world, Turbine the developer did for the gaming world. A beautiful and surprisingly accurate depiction of the books and scriptures of JRR Tolkien. A timeless Art Direction makes the game still look relevant today.Join the greatest Fantasy Universe ever imagined."

Being a huge Tolkien fan, this game gives me the sense of Middle-earth in a proper form. The classes are really fun and mostly balanced (certain unbalanced classes, though not unplayable are always getting fixed), the world is exciting and fun to level up through or just explore. The community is really helpful and are always ready to help someone in need. Crafting is great as well. Decorating your house was a really nice feature, but Standing Stone Games recently upgraded it and I haven't seen any other housing decorator system like it. To put it simply, it's amazing.I think my playtime on this game will say otherwise since I can't say enough. If you're interest in picking it up, please, do yourself a favor and do it."

The game, while multiplayer and hosts a variety of features for guilds and group quests, is designed just as much for singleplayer. Many times it feels like you're all alone in this vast world. hunting monsters and finding resources. It's a fantastic game set in Middle Earth where you can enjoy yourself alone or with friends. I have many fond memories of fishing, questing, and exploring.The game is FTP, well, as much as any successful MMO can be. You can grind to get the in game currency you need to aquire DLC (all but the most expansive ones) and odds are you will be a bit willing to buy something if you enjoy it enough. You can even travel to many of these expansion areas just to see how they are, you just won't have access to the quests. I played for hundreds of hours without so much as spending a dime, it's fantastic.I reccomend this game to anyone who wants to live in Tolkien's epic fantasy, it doesn't get much better than this!"

It's a lot of fun seeing how much care and attention has gone into recreating the world of middle earth.As an MMO, it is one of the best ones out. It is certainly more geared to solo players, but does a good job of catering to everyone. The classes range from basic to some of the most advanced and interesting classes I've ever seen in an MMO. (Take Warden or LoreMaster for example)! The community is also one of the friendliest and the servers are still busy and alive to this day. It has stood the test of time and still looks astonishingly beautiful as ever. Add to all that it has fantastic mood setting music you've got a class A product. Many players simply can't stop at a single character and over the years I have kept on coming back to this game. Without a doubt my favourite MMO ever. It's also great to see the dedication of Standing Stone in keeping their work alive and keeping lotro safe for the future years with a decent, not overly greedy free to play system. Much of the content can be enjoyed for free and extras can be bought as required. The only time you may consider spending money is to open up quest packs in different regions and expansion packs. But considering the size and amount of time you could foreseeably spend in this masterpiece, it is well worth it!"

The game has aged rather well when compared to its counterpart, Dungeons & Dragons Online.  If you want to do F2P go right ahead, the company who runs the game doesn't bog free players with pointless restrictions and mandatory purchases to move the game forward.  In my opinion, however, its worth becoming a VIP, as it only enhances your experience and you get your money's worth.  Anyone who has always wanted to try an MMORPG but is intimdated by bigger games like Guild Wars 2 or World of Warcraft should give this one a try!"

,Recommended,212500,29479047,Posted: 25 January,all,Abderite,"Played this game for way too long and way too many hours.Great game, fab community, superb wiki resources and game mods. The game is largely free from bots, cheats, exploits and if a spammer rears its ugly head once a year (if even that...last I saw one was 2012), it's laughed out the door.It's the theme park of theme parks, Lord of the Rings. Up to a couple of years ago, very down-to-earth and toned down graphics. Then WB games went medieval on the rear end of the game. In particular the store end of the game.Now you get deco pets (how about a rat the size of a horse or a shining spectral bear with a little snowstorm above it), silly character costumes and store enchants to rival many Asian micropayment grinders. Happily you can opt out of seeing any deco pets and if you see a bare-chested dwarf in purple tights running around town with a chicken nest on his head...so be it.On the plus side, there is zero focus on lingerie. The female character game models are as sexless as plywood and the males look either goofy, mildly gay or just a little burly. It's toned down but rather outdated and promises of updates to the character game models have been made.Typically, a micropayment game is aimed at making you pay and keep paying.LOTRO is different. If you sub for just one month (that is USD 15), you gain permanent perks and upgrades to your account and your characters that will remain forever. This means that the paywall is nearly non-existant.Technically you can grind and grind and utilize 99.99% of the features in the game and never whip out your wallet or add your credit card to the store. You can grind out in-game cash and you can grind out store points (example: quest area covering a certain amount of levels would cost 500 store points and you would have to spend 1-2 days dsolely grinding out store points to attain that amount).Game cash can be used to buy certain store products from other gamers. This is the one recently added pay-to-win game store bias that rubs me the wrong way. The few and far-between botters could use botted game gold to shop regular lootable items before but the choice was limited. Now they can buy most of the useful store items.Beef:store stuff vs game gold as long as a gamer is willing to spendsomewhat dated character game models inside a rather lovely gameno apparent effort is made to delete botters or exploiters even if these are very fewnot a game in maintenance mode but manned by a dwindling number of staffyearly novelty features quickly abandonedbad fishing (hey, I like good fishing in a game!)rather boring pvpSuperb:no gold sellersno focus on lingerie or sexualized childrenthe lore is deep and to a large extent exactgreat atmosphere and in-game muzakmostly great communitysuperb external wiki resources for any little feature or thing in the gamegreat options and conveniences for everything...freely adjust game window, turn weapon glow on and off, show or hide pets, chat filter if wanted, creatable user defined chat channels and tabs, save UI settings for alts but can use entirely different ones, any keyboard command adjustable and little extras like searchable NPC stores, searchable options and so on...really well done90% well-defined character classes not overlapping too much but not strictly trinity heal-tank-dps"

Numerous side quests scattered throughout Middle-earth will not enter this passage, since for the most part they are tasks like ""kill 5 goblins"" or ""bring 10 wolf tails"" and, with rare exceptions, are not worthy of our attention. But the main storyline is very interesting and, most importantly, it very closely intersects with the plot of the books ""The Lord of the Rings"" and ""The Hobbit."" We will meet a lot of familiar characters, take part in familiar events and how to properly ponostalgiruem.I will make a reservation that this video passage was created in order to consider the plot of the game and compare it with the books ""Lord of the Rings"" and ""Hobbit"", and not run through the whole game, skipping past the description of the quests and doing endless shooting of monsters.

You have come to the right place, today as I write this review Feburary 6th 2017, this game is alive. Ever since a year or so ago, they cut down their many servers with a average amount of players on it, some more than others, into a few big servers. This seemed to help restore the community although it did divid a few friends from old servers. The graphics on this game are good for the year they came out and are probably one of the better graphics found in most mmo rpgs, the content is fun, but to really enjoy it you have to enjoy the universe which it takes place in, like you wouldn't play Star Trek online if you didn't know anything about Star Trek. Although the game is based on the books and movies of lord of the rings, it has its own original feel to it, with its own sort of story and characters, although you get to see the characters from the books through your quests, and can even aid them in battle. With 10 classes and 5 races to choose from there will be lots of variety to choose from. Next, the community is probably the nicest I have ever seen, besides the few trolls that linger in world chat, you will meet many kinds of people, the role player, who no matter what sticks to their role, the pro alt leveler, who is on leveling his 10th character and solos everything and kills the quest targets for you, and the guy who you will probably be, the person who invites everyone they see, be it to finish a hard quest or to play a quick skirmish to get on to the next level. Find a kin that has a history and that you feel you can connect with, if you are starting to play this game with a group of friends, start a kinship and slowly grow. The devs on this game are actually not bad, of course its easy to complain about the game designers of any game. Usually if you have a complaint give them a fair amount of time and they will reply back. If you have read this far then you are probably interested now your next question is, ""Is this game pay to win"", the answer is yes/no if you are either young or retired you can spend plenty of spare time completing deeds to gain ingame currency. Although there are expansion packs that are a must, but if you get that far (first one being at lvl 50 ""Mine of Moria"" then you probably really like the game and should consider spending the like 20 US dollars on it. If you are still unsure if you wanna play this game, just download it, its free."

It's not impossible to progress without money, but the game askes for it a lot.It's kinda a fun game without money, but recommened playing with friends or else it gets boring fast.It has skill trees which is always fun in games. Archer is OP in 1v1's late game, I reccomened though!"

I remember then having problems with game (hard to start, game crash but when it worked it was OK).  So i managed to make som 1.5 k hours in it.  I got back to it when it came to steam - but only for 48h and that was too much.  After a long time i wanted to get back to this rubbish just to se whats happening now in it and i cant log in - - yes the old error 201.

Anything worth having is on the LOTRO store for prices that make it impossible to get without paying real-world cash for the coins.2 - This game is not for us who live in places where you still have to pay per megabyte of data, there are large ""updates"" every time the launcher starts. Looking at what is updating, I have to ask myself if I really need to be paying for different language loading screens.3 - Now it's broken. The latest update seems to have broken my copy (at least), which probably means I'd have to delete the game files and re-download it if I wanted to play further (see point 2).4 - I haven't really been paying much attention to world chat, but once or twice I noticed comments like ""if you don't want to be in a fellowship go find a single player game"" and ""if you want to quest alone go find a single player game"". A community that tells players to go away because they want to play a game in their own way is in trouble and heading toward becoming toxic."

You can't play the game without installing updates.""WHY IS THERE AN OPTION OF YES OR NO WHEN I OBVIOUSLY CAN'T PLAY THE GAME WITHOUT INSTALLING THEM EITHER WAY?!

Only bad thing is that the game has a bad tutorial. It is free to play but there is dlc.  U can buy them with a very rare in-game currency that takes a long time to get but most people buy most of them. PvP is Like no other game and amazing. U can play as orcs and spiders or the free people of middle earth, there is a big PvP region where there are out posts to capture that give buffs, castles that if defeated join your faction and give you quests, and an entire secret underground world filled with bosses, not to mention towns and mines to do quests and farm so u never even have to fight another player if you don't want to. You are going to want to work in groups of at least two though to survive, especially if u are low rank because there are high levels from the other faction roaming and npcs meant to fight groups of people."

If you like Middle Earth/Tolkien and haven't tried this game out yet, you should. It may not be as fast paced as some other MMOs but it's a great game to play casually. Don't think of leveling as a grind or competition, just get lost and have fun. There is loads of content, it gets updated regularly, and most machines will run this on medium quality or better. I've taken long breaks from this game and keep coming back for the atmosphere. Highly recommend!"
