The match gameplay is reminiscent of Sensible Soccer and other early 90's, and definitely works in a retro kind of way. The resource managing outside of matches helps build the game into a slightly larger, funner experience. All in all, NSS5 is a charming game that promises a few hours of fun.The drawback, however, is that the game is kind of a poorly designed, buggy mess. Save files get corrupted left and right, the game freezes with alarming regularity, and the puzzling online requirement tends to make starting new games a chore (hot tip: If you happen to buy it and struggle starting a game because of connectivity issues, edit the Settings\Settings.txt file. Change the line nettimeout=5 to nettimeout=100).All in all, I can't recommend it. There's not enough here to defend the crippling issues the game has, and definitely not enough to defend their pricing point. Steer clear."

This is true in this game, which is where the leveling up really increases the enjoyment factor.  Yes, you don't start out a super-star, your not, you are a rookie, but as you play it, and you improve your abilities, you become one.  As you become a super-star, not only are you winning your games, but you are living the life.  One of my favorite parts of this game, is how it includes off-the-field perks of being an athlete, and lets you live the life.  Great great game, for all the good-sport, sports-enthusiasts out there.  The game gives you several control options, my favorite, that worked well for me, was the 'game controller'."

Day by day you can practise, buy toys, go out with the girlfriend (if you have one), try to build up a rapport with your team mates, fans, or boss, etc. Initially the main thing is to build the skills and you do training drills where you have to bend the ball, beat defenders, tackle, dribble around cones, etc. in a limited amount of time/attempts, if you do your skills when you play games improve in the appropriate area.In terms of playing matches you start off as a sub only having a few minutes, and maybe not being picked at all. Based on doing well in various in game stats you try to get good game ratings, which will get you picked more often, or even a starting position in the team if you keep doing well. At this point you start to having to manage your energy by buying toys to keep you occupied during matches, NRG drinks (which often give you cramps during a game), etc. You also need to spend energy managing relationships if you want your teammates to pass to you, your girlfriend not to dump you, your friends not to hate you, etc. So you get into a balancing act of all these things, and you have to learn how to play the minigame puzzles (pair matching for relationships, ""simon says"" for the media), etc.The main in game challenge isn't really about winning matches, once you know the AIs weaknesses this is fairly easy (for example the quick turn to lure defenders into sliding tackles to clear the way, the banana dribble close to the goalie to lure him out and then walk the ball into the net, the direct vertical run outside the goal to curl into the same side top corner, the diagonal curling out/in balls, etc.). The problem instead is trying to use the match to improve your ranking and stats - so doing lots of safe passing in your own half to build up teammate approval without spending energy, getting some tackles in without getting cards, and otherwise building up your stats for passing/tackles/set pieces to increase your transfer value and wages higher, etc., as the benefit from just scoring more and more goals and winning games is capped - you have to become more rounded to be the best.Overall the game is quite good fun at times, although it can be frustrating as well, and your team mates need a lot of managing/adaptation to actually be useful to you given how braindead they are, and the out of match stuff makes for a reasonably interesting balancing act. Once you are successful it does all become fairly formulaic however, as once you are fully skilled up and have largely capped out your relationships it is relatively easy to deal with any new off the field problems, and winning matches/championshops/cups is a breeze once you have the skills and know the AIs strengths and weaknesses. I am not sure I would recommend it to most people however at full price, as I doubt most will play it for long enough to really justify the price tag, and apparently it hasn't been on sale for over a year at this point, but this could be a fun game if you like the idea (and have a controller!) and can put up with some bugs/flaws."

I think they care  more about the IOS version. probably because thats the version with micro-T's and such. There can be some annoying bugs but they arenbt game breaking. Once you get down to gameplay its actually good fun and it makes for a nice little pick up and play football experience. I find though that playing for a long time can become boring and very repetetive. Graphics are 2D but its style is good very similar to old skool Title Sensible Soccer. Overall i would reccomend to those that dont want a serious football sim and are just after that classic arcade feel sports gem.

,Recommended,212780,8701354,"Posted: 13 January, 2014",all,Rosso,"Fun little soccer game, I'm playing it to create a basis for a future character in Football Manager, however there are a few gripes.probably the most glaring problem is that your teammate AI can be unreliable; like they'll run straight at the other team's player and get tackled, rather than try dodging or passing the ball.Your coach can be bi-polar sometimes with his game and post-game comments.ball hit-box is a little funny sometimes, where you won't 'catch' the ball when you thought you would.The refs though are pretty accurate, even though the game doesn't explain what constitutes a yellow flag (I had to actually look up what they give them for and make a guess)Don't expect matches to be upwards of 90 minutes either, maximum is only ~15 minutes for a regular match.If you can get past all that though, you're in for a cute little time-waster."
76561198015615984,Recommended,212780,34054195,Posted: 6 August,all,Batu,"Pro's:+ One of a kind soccer game with no real competitor in this field. FIFA and PES of course have the better game play, but are lacking when it comes to a career mode like in NSS+ A lot of leagues to choose from which give some kind of replay value to the game+ Nice Leaderboard to compare yourself with every other gamer playing this game. Teams are also setup to feature other players instead of the real ones+ Decent relationship and lifestyle/happiness management through buying things and playing mini gamesContra's:- Very repetitive- After a while, it also gets way to easy and scoring 50 Goals in a Season is basically normal. Winning the Champions League with an Aserbaidschan side is easily possible even on hard mode.- Gameplay is lackluster and pretty much always the same. If you approach the goal from the side you can score with every shot- Wacky controls- Very streamlined. Even if you make FK Baku EL winners in your first season, some of the top clubs are not interested in you.- Sometimes pretty unrealistic match resultsBut even though the game has a lot of contra's and is really not a good game, you still end up wasting many hours in it to finally play for your favorite club or get every achievement.So I would basically recommend it, purely on the fact, that there is no real alternative if you like to play a career mode soccer game.."

,Recommended,212780,12263409,"Posted: 27 September, 2014",all,Goalie,"NSS5 is a football life 'simulator' where you create a player and play football in any one of a ridiculous number of nations and your national team too.The teams are based on real teams, so anyone with basic footballing knowledge should be able to tell that Stamford FC are Chelsea and that Gunners are Arsenal. Your starting team determines your starting skill and wage, your skill can be improved by doing training sessions that range from boring to infuriatingly ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥zzle. When not training or playing you are either improving relationships with people you don't give a♥♥♥♥♥♥about so that you don't become depressed, drinking when you do become depressed, or failing to get girlfriends because they dont like your lifestyle. This part of the game hits close to home and makes me cry.When you do get big money you can use it to buy stuff to impress women and buy PEDs which make you a better player, you can also abuse sponsorship deals for stat increasing boots and other gear. When you level up and start scoring for fun you can then demand funny money to spend on more pointless stuff that no-one would ever buy. Oh a gold chain for £2000? I forgot it was 1988 and I was Slick Rick.The game has some always online feature that allows you to play with other players' avatars in matches which despite the fact that I play for a 4th division Scottish team always seems to be 6'8"" black guys named Devarious Le'shintrella. The servers are also complete♥♥♥♥♥and break all the time meaning that you just play against AI characters instead.Game is fairly fun but the fact that I always wanted to be a footballer and have a girlfriend mean that playing this game makes me self-harm and drink a lot of alcohol in real life whilst I force my player to be an alcoholic too because I never got to be a footballer and don't have a girlfriend.Don't play if you're depressed.P.s. if you're reading this and a girl pls add me on steam I promise to send gifts <3"

Sensible Soccer gameplay was great compared to Kick Off 2 since KO2 was too fast for my taste. (Hint: Teenagers and Fifa era players stay away, you wont get the fun of it.)+ Gameplay (Rpg/Sim): Transferring yourself, training stuff, buying things and managing personal life adds a great flavour to the game.+ Art: Actual matches looks too similar to Sensible World of Soccer with great animation, crowd and weather effect add-on.Cons:- Sound: Music is bad. Sfx does its part on matches but could have been far better.- DRM system: Signing on to a server (which fails to connect most of the time) is not a good idea (PS: You dont have to be signed in to play).- Needs more improvement and rpg flavour (maybe NSS6?)Final verdict:I've spent many fun hours with the game.

IE: Sometimes, your character dosen't tackle when you want him to, you kick a perfect pass and your teamate miss it,well it's apparently your fault and the coach gonna take points from you because of that. Or you ask a pass from a teamate and he throw it like 3213 meters from you, well that is also your fault. Also, if you interecpt the ball from their goaler to a player, but doing so the ball goes to a player from the other team, well it counts as a bad pass...

Along with football/soccer, you also play the life of a football/soccer player. The reality has been implemented via several things such as losing energy while going to play away, not ignoring the girlfriend, making the papers due to sensational events, earning from horse-racing more than football/soccer. So it has a pretty comprehensive content.In the game, there are also some events irrelevant to reality like the Premier League championship of a team that have actually never been in the top places of the league, the quarter-finals of UEFA Champions League's including at least one team that actually join to the earlier qualification rounds of the tournament, German National Team's scarcely qualifying out of the qualifications for UEFA European Championship and FIFA World Cup...

,Not Recommended,212780,10090856,"Posted: 12 May, 2014",all,Yoshimtu,"I played this for a good chunk of time. It's a fun little casual game, if you can get past the flaws, and mainly the game flat out not working. Yes, beware. Not every user, but I seen PLENTY of people have an issue where they cannot connect to the servers. And this has been going on for years now! The developer said he is trying to fix it, but so far nothing has changed. I don't know exactly what it is but it seems changing hosts would fix it, I could be wrong. Anyways, if you cannot connect to the game, you CANNOT play from my experience. The only help is to ""keep trying, use a proxy"", and even ""try leaving the game on overnight"" from another forum. (keep trying works until I have to load the game again do to not wanting to play or crashing) which is unacceptable even for an indie game, even made by one person. Don't have online DRM if you can't keep a server working for everyone.Onto the actual gameplay, if you wanna risk the above, or manage to get through (I had a hell of a time) The gameplay is ""aright"" it's a nice unique game, but nothing more than I expect out of a flash game. There is a decent amount of game flaws, but for the most part they can be looked past. I have had the game crash somewhat often as well which is also a downside.The music isn't good at all, and in a top down football game you really need background music thats enjoyable, minor complaint however, doesn't really change much.Overall, I'd say the game is worth $5, however this is BEFORE the connection problems. I don't think this game should even be allowed to be sold on Steam with the current issues of the connecting. As it is preventing plenty of people from playing the game according to forum posts, with no help other then what I mentioned and basically a ""I'll fix it"" years ago. Definitely do not recommend this game, but if you can look past the horrible connection issues, it should provide some fun for a little while."

The bad consists in silly puzzles, loosing ""fame"" even if you had 5 assists in a match and you can only get a girlfriend if you have a certain amount of money. Training also seems a bit off in terms of difficulty, some too easy and others too hard. Prices on players are also non comprehensible.However I did buy this game to play the core of the game and see my youngster rise to the stars, that I have done. He is now at Swansea, has won the world cup for Denmark and is world wide known, everyone wants him but his pricetag is lower than the average premier league footballer, much lower. That did not stop me from buying a joypad and enjoying playing a lot, you control a single player on the pitch and after a few trials I got the hang of it, its fun to score and assist while the coach never seems happy insulting you on every turn.In the rise of ranks I started at the Conference North with Histon... then proceeded to Dag&Red, Exeter and then Swansea. I am mainly enjoying playing the matchesand looking at the statistics, something which also has kept me playing. I can look at my history and check a lot of stuff which I have done in the past.The rest of the game is mediocre at best, some of the stuff seems made for 6 year old kids hence many bad reviews. The price should be a bit lower, around the 5 euro mark, as it is now its a bit too expensive but I would still recommend just for the core play. You can always wait till it comes on sale however."

Oh yes, I could play hours and maybe my skills would increase so much that I could do miracles with the really bad controls but I even doubt so.Somewhat I feel like there is no freedome in this game. It's hard to explain but I feel like the game was developped to be play only the way the devs intended it: the long, frustating, hard way."

In the 90s and early 2000s I could see a game causing a BSOD issue, but in this day and age it's unthinkable.  There is NO support from the designer.  Support tickets on their forums range back years without replies or fixes."

,Recommended,212780,7812149,"Posted: 28 November, 2013",all,Ayresome,"This is an arcadey football game with interesting RPG elements.You are playing the part of a single footballer. That's a very refreshing mechanic, which hasn't been used in many other games recently. That makes this game fairly refreshing.There are almost two games feeding into each other: Firstly, there's playing the matches. This is a good, but not stellar, arcade style football game, with a tiled view from behind the goal, similar to the various Amiga games of the 1990s. You just control your own player rather than the whole team. The game is fast-paced and holds your attention. The ""one player"" mechanic is also very different to most other games.Secondly, there's the RPG game. This has you ""levelling up"" your player, maintaining relationships with team mates and friends, saving up for houses, flash cars and the like. You can also do several other things, such as gamble your money at the casino or racetrack. The mini-games providing this are all very simple, but there are a lot of them and they're competently done.The most interesting part comes where the two games overlap. Should you pass to a teammate rather than scoring yourself - because then he'll like you and be more likely to pass to you next time, or do you score yourself because you want the goal bonus to buy some new boots? When scoring a goal, do you celebrate with the fans to improve your relationship with them, or do you celebrate with the manager so he's more likely to pick you next week?I found this interesting and refreshing, and brings some planning and thinking to the arcade-style match engine.If you're wondering whether this is the same game as its more famous cousin on iOS, it's not. This is much more fleshed out and playable, particularly the match engine which is real-time. Incidentally, if you haven't played the iOS version then it's well worth the price.It's worth pointing out that the game is nigh-on impossible to play using keyboard and mouse. You'll definitely need some kind of controller. I just used a cheap USB one, which worked absolutely fine. The buttons are user-definable.The game does get a bit samey after a while - it's essentially the same game 20 hours in as it is 20 minutes in. However, at the price that's not a huge problem.I enjoyed playing this. If you like arcadey football games, or are bored of FIFA and want something different, then this is well worth a look."

Beside the game will automatically skip into next game, and the stats are more fewer, no stats like acceleration, control, etc. Better get NSS 2010 though"
