Combining the creative power of Penny Arcade with Zeboyd's love for old-school role-playing games creates a package of hilarious weirdness and nostalgic vibrations (with a couple hints of modernity) that feels neither derivative nor stale. The turn-based combat has a perfectly applied dose of additional strategy, which can bring even a high-leveled party of characters to their doom if their actions are dictated without thought. To compliment this, the story, dialogue, items, and enemies all carry the ridiculous, eloquent, occasionally poetic writing of Jerry ""Tycho"" Holkins as well as art inspired by Mike ""Gabe"" Krahulik. All of these elements together makeOn the Rain-Slick Precipice of Darkness 3a funny, bizarre quest that any fan of early RPGs is sure to enjoy."
76561198123412640,Recommended,213030,15028709,"Posted: 23 March, 2015",all,Sam Lilly,"Penny Arcade's On the Rain-Slick Precipice of Darkness 3 is a comedic RPG with some parody elements and convenient features. I can't tell you too much about the story, as I don't want to spoil the game. Also, I can't fill you in on the backstory because... I haven't played the first two games. The reason I started on this game, and the fourth, is because they were in a pack and I had played the previous two games the new developers had done before getting asked to do these, which were Breath of Death VII and Cthulhu Saves the World. That's where my perspective is coming from, so keep it in mind. Basically, you're a company that investigates supernatural happenings, and supernatural things happen. So... you investigate them. That's really all I can tell you without getting into potential spoiler territory.You can explore specific locations on a world map with well defined places to go. Inside these places, you can search for treasure, battles, and main plot points for going there. While there is some interesting story and dialogue, the battles are the meat and potatoes of the game. The battles are nice because they are not random. Instead, they are represented by monsters clearly visible on the map. You battle in a turn based fashion, however there's a meter on the top of the screen. This determines the order the combatants will attack. It will be initially set by speed stats and certain passives, but it can also be changed by using slows, stuns, and interruptions. A combatant can also move up their position on the command line by defending, although this will not allow them to attack on that turn. So why bother? Well, to reduce major damage from a major attack, or possibly to help utilize another interesting mechanic. In this game, you don't have a pool of MP to work with. Instead, you start battles with zero MP and gain 1 MP per turn. So if you want to build it up, you can use items, use certain abilities to boost it, or simply do something that does not require MP. This forces you to manage your health and position on the timeline much more carefully, rather than having magic users spam abilities right from the get go.So what gives you your abilities? Well, each character starts with their own class. The classes dictate what abilities, passive or active, these characters have. This will affect how you use them. Beyond this, as the game goes on you will receive badges, each with their own additional classes. You get to add one, and eventually two, to each party memeber. This gives them a total of three classes, and many possibilities on how you can build them. However, badges can only be on one person at a time, so you can't use the same class on every character at once. All of the badges and characters level up as you win battles, although the ones you actively use will level up faster. Also, you can further customize your characters with equipment as well.This game is full of conveniences, such as the aforementioned blanket leveling and visible battles. Whenever you finish a battle, all characters are revived and restored. If you lose a battle, you get to try it again. You can save or change badges at any point. Convenient traveling through an easy world map, with shops in fixed positions and a training area to grind if needed. The game does a lot to try and ease the burdens of RPGs while still being an RPG.However, I found a few things a bit disappointing. One is that there are too many classes leveling up constantly. It seems that after every battle, at least one if not multiple classes gain levels and often new abilities, which is a lot to look at and manage. You'll be constantly checking your new abilities to see what they do and who they will be good for, depending on how you're trying to build characters. Plus, the fighting system is somewhat complex for newcomers, which detracts from the game's convenience factor a bit. Also, while the game tries to teach you one thing at a time to gradually get you familiar with the gameplay (which I like), it feels like once you finally understand how to fight and manage your badges and equipment and strategize, the game is basically done. It also ends on a cliffhanger story-wise. So, this whole game essentially feels like it is a buildup for the sequel, both in story and basic gameplay ideas. Although the sequel (which I will review once I finish) is rather different in some aspects. I guess I just felt like the game was getting me ready for the real adventure to start, and then it abruptly ended.Overall, it's still a good game. Fun for people new to RPGs and looking for good value games. The characters and story have enough charm to carry some of the weight. Plus all the conveniences, well paced learning curve, and constant upgrades to manage, make for an entertaining experience throughout. I guess it's good that the game left me wanting more rather than being sick of it, and the extra mode recommended after you finish the main game gives it some more for you to play and satisfy your cravings. However, I'd say that if you're looking at this game, which is only 5 dollars alone, you might as well just pay the 8 bucks and get the two pack because you'll be well prepared to take on the fourth game after this. I got them both on sale for a dollar which was well worth the price. Judging this game on its own, I'd give Penny Arcade's On the Rain-Slick Precipice of Darkness 3 a solid 6 out of 10 for being an engaging RPG experience without the common headaches that befall so many other RPGs."

I PERSONALLY RATE THIS GAME AS ""A"" FOR ADULTS.This game is quite different than the previous games in the series. First off, it is now more traditionally a rpg in this game..the comic book style in previous games are gone and have been replaced by rpg goodness. This may turn off people that played the 2 previous games, but i think it is much better this way. Also, if you wonder what happened to your character from the previous 2 games, there is short little side game that answers that question in the game. Note that you must be used to this game to try the extra mission.I actually like the changes they did for this game. Anyways, i recommend playing the first 2 games because the storyline is required for this series. Recommended game for new rpg aspects in it and fun dialogue and humour."

The previous Penny Arcade games, in their 3D environment, semi-free-roaming capabilties, witty dialogue, character customization, and comic book-styled cutscenes were excellent, but this one...I just can't bring myself to keep playing. It's become a 2D RPG-stylized game, and though it started out pretty alright, the required battling, which for the most part, is every enemy you see on screen, really started to bore the living fecal matter out of me. It was just too much. Between every fight, you regain all your stats fully, so there's really no urgency of healing, which could be taken as a blessing, but...I don't know...I felt less imersed in this game, less dedicated to the characters and outcome. Sure, the dialogue is witty, for the most part, but given the lackluster gameplay and visuals...it just wasn't fun. I would've rather just read a comic book with the same style and written dialogue without the non-stop RPG fights chewing up my time and killing me with boredom.I'm genuinely sorry for not enjoying it more.

And here we are again, on the rain-slick precipice of darkness!Part 1+2 (which you should totaly check out - they're fun) used a mouse-based rhythm-clicking battle system, where well-timed buttonpresses powered up your attacks or activated special moves.Part 3 ditches this whole mechanic - including the graphics style.What you get is a homage to the classic 16bit-rpgs like the older final fantasy games.With full controller support, playing this thing is a blast. I never really got used to the keyboard+mouse-clicky-thingy in parts 1+2. Now you get a very traditional battle system, as well. ATB-style, party of 4, skills, spells, items.Once again, enemies are weird or downright ridiculous (which is good), Job classis for your party are hilarious (which is very good) and the dialogue is over-the-top nonsensical (which depends upon personal preference - I found it well-written and immensely entertaining).Should you play it?If you like the old 16bit-games and dig this kind of humor, then yes.

76561197971628333,Recommended,213030,27947245,"Posted: 28 November, 2016",all,Modranto,"A basic, SNES style RPG that gets by on comedy and nostalgia.Here is a game that largely matches expectations without exceeding them. If you're looking for solid, retro-RPG combat and witty writing then you'll find it here at a very reasonable price. However, the story behind all the sarcasm and jokes, while entertaining enough, lacks tension and impact. It sets up the following game for a more interesting setting and conclusion, but that's not enough to elevatethisgame's narrative above ""mostly forgettable"".Precipice of Darkness 3 does a great job of bringing complexity and flexibility into its turn based combat. Each party member has one permanent base class that matches their personality. In time you'll unlock two additional class slots for each character that can be swapped at will between battles. You choose from a pool of bizarre classes that allow you to easily experiment until you find a winning combination. I really like that unused classes still gain experience and level up, just at a slightly slower pace than the in use classes. This negates the chance of any class becoming under leveled to the point of discouraging you from trying it.In battle the game uses a combat bar to queue actions that is much like the old Grandia series and, more recently, Child of Light. It is one of my favorite turn based systems that allows for characters and attacks of varying speeds as well as strategic interrupts of enemy actions. To be victorious I needed to make proper use of buffs, interrupts and adjust my strategy to account for enemy weaknesses and resistances. I played on the Veteran difficulty and found it to be on point except for in one area called The Bank of Money that had a frustrating and unusual spike in difficulty.The city map that you use to navigate from area to area is very plain with linear paths that don't allow for any deviation or hidden surprises. The exploration areas are genre standard mazes of corridors, barriers and rooms. Their layout is pleasing, including treasure chests, non-random enemy encounters and silly descriptions when you examine some objects. Visuals are definitely not this game's strong suit. They get the job done without being outright ugly, but the best compliment I can give them is that there are some creatively comedic enemy designs.Having not played the previous two games nor read much of the Penny Arcade comics I'm coming at this game without a preexisting attachment to the characters. While I did enjoy their distinct and quirky personalities, they only grew on me a little over time. There are some decent attempts at character development, however the priority is clearly on humor over substance. As for the comedy, for me it was consistently amusing without ever being a truly laugh-out-loud level of funny. It's worth noting that I did not feel like I was missing anything from not having played parts 1 and 2.My total playtime clocked in at 15 hours for all the content this game has to offer. It is a modestly successful entry in the relatively sparse field of games that place a heavy emphasis on comedy. I am comfortable recommending this game to any old school RPG fans out there or Penny Arcade aficionados.Click here to check out my review of Penny Arcade's On the Rain-Slick Precipice of Darkness 4."

With your funny and well drawn cutscenes, unique gameplay that was different and more casual for those not interested in Final Fantasy-esque turn based combat. You were fun, funny, charming.Well obviously that's not what this is.I don't know what happened, but long story short, Penny Arcade didn't want to go Rainslick anymore for some odd reason, so the guys that made Cthulhu Saves the World, were called upon to make the 3rd and 4th games of this series.There is nothing good about this game to me. First off, Pixel graphics. While it CAN work depending on the game and how it's used (See Papers Please), here it's just used as always used, for a Final Fantasy knockoff. The combat is not exciting, nothing moves except for characters and enemies to get into place.BUT the worst sin this game made, was one that made me give up on everything about the rest of this series.Ok, so you're in a bank looking for a portrait, when you're exploring vaults and you think you're gonna find jokes. One of the ""jokes"" is so horrible that it forces you to play it until completion.A FULL ON FINAL FANTASY 1 PARODY!!!And then into Star Trek.And the game forces you to stop and play all of this for no reason, when I could have gone into the right vault and left. It's only there for grinding that's pointless.Go play Rainslick episode one and two, and try not to cry at the end of two, because then you'll think about how it got botched and replaced with this garbage."

It's an RPG, turn based combat. There's a load of classes atop the main class for each character. Tycho's a scholar, Moira's a Gumshoe, Jim is a Necromaster and Gabe is... well, Gabe (I forgot what his class is).The story is humorous, the same humor that you get from Cthulhu Saves the World only not as meta (until the fourth one but that's another game review).If you've played any old school RPG like Final Fantasy before it went 3D, or anything along similar lines, I recommend this to you."

But this isn't quite the case... In practice it's more a trade-off: The reduction in graphics and interactive combat system has been substituted with a greater array of foes and a very extensive combat-class system which delivers new moves and abilities frequently.It's not necessarily better / worse... justdifferent.So whilst you can no longer block attacks... you can now choose whether Gabe goes the way of the gardener or just turns into a dinosaur and calls it a day. Or both! Because who doesn't like a green-fingered velociraptor that's conscientious about the local bee population?There's ultimately greater strategic depth this time around, particularly where you can disrupt turn orders, schedule repeating moves and think about elemental damage too. The classes are brilliantly varied and very creative, more so than any other RPG I've come across. Plenty to mix-and-match and experiment with. The combat is also clever in that enemies get stronger the longer the battle goes on... creating a clever race against time and breaking possible stalemates. Like before, there are no random encounters, but considerably more battles this time around - some that even come with fun rules / conditions, which always livens things up!The dark humour from before is also still there - charming and daft as ever. If anything, the free reign to go a bit more abstract this time around has blown open the doors to brilliant off-beat humour. The dialogue is great and the enemy designs are also brilliant - particularly where each one has a comical tag-line. Always a joy to read, especially where there are a lot of cultural references, parodies and awful puns to be had.It's not without its downsides, however. Firstly, the story feels a bit shoe-horned into the plot: A lot of battles and fun chit-chat and then suddenly a major plot element squeezed into a brief dialogue. The sound effects are also a little basic and repetitive - a thudding 'tak', a sweeping 'fwschi' and a 'bwoop' for magic effects (of course)... So not the sharpest in effects. But solid gameplay indeed (except fighting your way through a haunted housetwice- which sucked) augmented with additional free DLC / dungeons has made this a very strong follow-up to the Precipice of Darkness series. Despite being quite the jump from the previous style, the quality still feels very much there."

Does away with some of the genre's frustrations - random battles, has ""running"", and multiple difficulties; the hardest of which is borderline unfair (rng based) in some encounters.The story and dialogue are pretty ridiculous.  Each area brings new enemy types and no two encounters have the same configuration.  There are many jobs to mix and match on your characters, but there are a few obviously strong and a few very weak.Should be over 20 hours on insane, much shorter if you play on a lower difficulty and don't have to retry battles."

In fact, the writing in this game was probably my favorite part. Constantly making clever jokes, the dialouge never got old. As a turn based fighting game, I enjoyed the skill variety and the mixture of class options. I hadn't expected any kind of depth from a title like this but they surprised me.The item system was lacking in my opinion since the best gear was handed to you as a part of the story anyways. My only other complaint would be that the story line was a bit hard to follow. Now, perhaps that's my fault since I didn't want to invest a whole lot of plot-thought but I am also concerned that the original two titles would have been a prerequisite.While I can reccommend this game, I do so with some reservations. I don't feel particularly excited about playing the next game in the series and that seems like a bad sign.

The writing is the same as it was (perhaps even better), but if you're not a fan of Jerry Holkins' style, this game probably won't change that. As a fan of these types of RPGs in my youth, this game brought a lot of nostalgia to the table, and I enjoyed it for that alone.

Monster fights are in specific locations that you need to go through but once you beat a monster at a location that's it. There are no random encounters and the only benefit to fighting is to gain strength for the next fight and because you have to fight. There are maybe 6-8 fights you can avoid only because the path branches and you only have to fight on path A or path B. On easy you almost don't need to try, but if you want to punish yourself then go ahead and crank up the difficulty level.

You may also line the bottom with parchment paper, if desired.Step 2: Cream the butter and 2 cups granulated sugar in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, until light and fluffy, about 5 minutes. With the mixer on medium speed, add the eggs, 1 at a time, and the lemon zest.Step 3: Sift together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a bowl. In another bowl, combine 1/4 cup lemon juice, the buttermilk, and vanilla. Add the flour and buttermilk mixtures alternately to the batter, beginning and ending with the flour. Divide the batter evenly between the pans, smooth the tops, and bake for 45 minutes to 1 hour, until a cake tester comes out clean.Step 4: Combine 1/2 cup granulated sugar with 1/2 cup lemon juice in a small saucepan and cook over low heat until the sugar dissolves. When the cakes are done, allow to cool for 10 minutes. Remove the cakes from the pans and set them on a rack set over a tray or sheet pan; spoon the lemon syrup over them.

However the games uniqueness and quirkyness quickly gets tiresome; after reading way too much text that ultimatley says nothing and fighting way too many unnecessary battles that are way too easy the game is boring.The pacing is also very bad with the game giving you too many jobs at once with some being very overpowered and others being totally useless. Nice graphics and unnecessary words doesn't make for a good game.It's not a bad game by any means but if it's not up your alley then you will quickly get bored of the overuse of superfulous words and overly intelligent themes. I don't think the series spans four games because the games are good but instead they did it so they can try and sell it as good.

,Recommended,213030,1934144,"Posted: 29 June, 2012",all,eXcruciate,This is a neat throwback homage to old school Final Fantasy games. If you loved Final Fantasy III you will have a fun time checking this out. Worth 5 bucks in my opinion.
,Not Recommended,213030,7799497,"Posted: 27 November, 2013",all,utumno86,"I love Penny Arcade and immensly enjoyed the earlier iterations of PA: OtRSPoD, but this one fell short. I like Zeboyd's idea of adding new features to the retro RPG model to make it interesting, but no ammount of innovation can possibly remove the mind-numbing tedium of those old games, and no ammount of nostalgia can make them fun. The game took me about ten hours, and that is more than double the ammount of time I'm willing to spend on such a repetitive combat system. Further, while the earlier games were funny throughout, and had amusing plot points revealed about the world of new Arcadia, this one  was only good for the occasional chuckle, and none of the plot was more interesting than stringing your characters along a series of drawn-out dungeons. Seriously, what has happened to Penny Arcade?"
,Not Recommended,213030,8673571,"Posted: 11 January, 2014",all,aejira,"Summary: The game is an obvious throwback to the RPGs of the 16-bit era, with elements that are uniquely set to the ""Penny Arcade"" universe. The nostalgic appeal loses its' charm very quickly, with an intentionally incoherent storyline and script [which may appeal to fans of the series], extremely repetitive and subpar combat system, and limited exploration. However, similar to how I feel about Farcry 3: Blood Dragon, the game is very short and the main story plus bonus prelude can be completed in 6 hours without much effort. There is some replayability with the different classes available, but I personally cannot see myself replaying the main storyline since it offers little reward or enough of a altered playthrough. The game has some merit and can be a great casual play over the course of a weekend, but I would not recommend it and give it a 2/5.Although this is the third installment in the Penny Arcade's On the Rain-Slick Precipice of Darkness, the approach is completely different in comparison to the previous games. Changing from a 3-D to sprite-based 2-D world is the most  apparent change, but there are a couple additional elements to the game. Timing attacks, button combinations, and overkills have changed in favor of classes, interrupts, and magic. Classes in the game allow for different strategies in combating the enemy and will offer the greatest amount of customization. They range from the Scholar, which utilizes various magic spells, to the Brute which favors more physical-based attacks. By the game's end you will have the ability to equip 3 classes at the same time and can various class mixtures that favor a specific play-style.  Want to build the ultimate melee hero? You can try to mash the Brute, Hobo, and Masochist classes to maximize your strength and plus up on physical attacks. Now, due to the way that MP is accrued in the game, this has some serious limitations. MP is earned throughout a battle, for each turn a character will gain one point of MP. This means that more or less 90% of your battles will follow the same pattern and will make the game extremely repetitive. For me, I had Gabe go into an attack stance, Tycho cast an Apocalypt, Jim cast a Skeleton, and Moira interrupt a monster. Could I have changed it up? Sure! But why would I purposefully choose an option that would have been less effective in those 90% of the battles I fought? I strongly believe that if the game had more of a traditional battle system, similar to the SNES Final Fantasies then it would have made the fighting system more enjoyable.One element of the game that I thought was a positive was the use of interrupts in the game. In a sense the game is turn-based, but as you can probably see on screenshots, there is a WAIT-COMMAND-ACT phase. Once a character reaches the COMMAND point, you decide on your action and wait until the character reaches ACT for it to execute. Now some of the classes have certain abilities that will give you the ability to interrupt the enemy. For this to be effective, you have to time your character's interrupt to occur when the enemy is between the COMMAND and ACT points. If successful you can drive back the enemy's bar all the way back to the WAIT phase. This will become critical mid and late game because the more you can interrupt and slow down the enemy, the weaker the enemy will be in the long run. As the battle progresses, each turn of the enemy will yield typically a 10% increase to its' attack. This can be interpretted in two ways: either end the battle fast or prevent the enemy from acting. Certain characters, like Moira, can be class mixed to maximize her ability to interrupt the enemy and give time to the rest of the party to get a few additional actions at the beginning of the battle.As with the previous installments, the world is rather small and the vast amount of exploration you will do in the game is limited to a a dozen dungeons. Battles are not randomnized but the types of enemy you fight will be varied and figuring out what their strengths and weaknesses can add some strategy. So the game has a set amount of battles, with pre-set monsters in each battle, and you will fight each battle at full strength [the party regenerates both items and HP after each battle]. If it isn't apparent yet, the game is linear, and each playthrough will be roughly the same as your previous playthroughs. There are only 5 playable characters in the game, of which only 4 will be useable mid to late game. As odd as it sounds, even though there are four characters, there is an extremely limited amount of character development in the game. I know of the loose associations for these characters, but there's nothing beyond that, nothing that really makes me change my opinion or gain an interest in any of the characters. Jim is a floating skull in a jar, he doesn't talk...we learn nothing new about him. Moira  was Tycho's ex-wife, we know something happened between them, but nothing is really pounded out, no flashbacks or intimate moments discussed. There may be some external source material available, but it is still the game's responsibility to draw the gamer into the world and develop a connection with the characters.Hitting on the storyline and script, I know that there are fans out there that just love the humor and nonsensical conversations in the game, but as I played on it felt like it detracted from the game. The awkward, completely random, and  unnecessarily ornate dialogue just gave me even less to care about, the storyline is so muddled and incoherent that I found myself more confused and uncaring about the trials and tribulations of the party. I'm not asking for a 16-bit Game of Thrones, but what I would like is a storyline that makes sense...that has a purpose, an objective that is easily understood and draws me closer to the characters and plot rather than detract from it.So in conclusion the game is mediocre at best. It has its' moments, both good and sometimes really bad, but the game has some serious flaws that limits your enjoyment. Buy it if it's very cheap, buy if you were a fan of the earlier games, but do not buy it if you're expecting to relive the glory days of the 16-bit era. The nostalgia runs out so fast, even with the Dragon Quest world and the Super Mario World-esque overworld, and when it runs out you'll realize that the game doesn't have any legitimate merits to stand on. 2/5"

Other people have complained that it's linear, especially in the ""overworld"", and that is certainly true, but I'm not really bothered by it. For me, the biggest problem with PA3 is that PA4 is so much worse.  This game ends on a cliffhanger and finding out how the story ends requires you to play the sequel ... and unfortunately, it turns out that PA4 is somewhere between mediocre and terrible.

So it is review time.Story- Some time has passed since the events of RSPoD 2 when Gabe and Tycho go on another mission to find out who Mr. Blood really is and what he is up to. But things are not what they seem to be as it seems everyone has a secret to hide. Just when you think you know someone. This story is quite darker than the previous two games with a fair amount of death, betrayals and lies. My main problem with the story, though, was where was my character from the first two games. After all he's  been through, he seems to dissapear from the game for good. Well, he (or she) is not forgotten as there is a little side game prolouge that explains his dissapearance, humorous but desturbing, that is all I will say on that. A-Graphics- Well, Zeboyd games now takes the wheel for creating this game and so they took a completly different direction graphically. Remeber the old Final Fantasy games for the SNES? That is the style to expect for the remaining games. The retro style looks nice and well defined but may not be for everyone. CSound- There is no voice acting this time around and the retro sound effects are lifted straght from FF6 but the music is actually an improvement from the previous 2 games with a surprizingly rich score. BGameplay- This game plays just like an FF game from SNES days and that is not a bad thing. The controls are easy to get used to and are even better with controller options available (XBOX controller preferred). The dungeons are fun to explore and the battles are a blast from the past. There is even a class system for additional strategy in battle though the fights are relativly easy, it's fun to expirament with different combinations of classes. The down side is that the world map is very restrictive as you follow a strict path from point to point, making the game seem kinda restrictive. B+Overall- Due to the poor sales of the first two games, the project was almost canceled, but was picked up by a different company to finish. As such, you cannot transfer saved games. Though they manage to find creative ways around this issue, it still feels dissapointing that you cannot continue as your created character and that really bugged me throughout. But it still was a fun game and much improved from its predecessors. Recommended. B-"

There are no random battles, and no battle is repeated twice; every battle at least has a different configuration of enemies. Items, HP and MP are all used on a battle-by-battle basis, so you don't have to worry about stocking up before you go into a dungeon or not fighting to your last breath because of the battles to come. You just give your all and fight to the death in every battle; dead characters still gain experience, so there's no need to give up or delay ending the battle if some of your characters have fallen. The way they handle MP is pretty fun; you start the battle with 0 and gain 1 every turn, so you have to save up for more powerful attacks. In addition, enemies become more powerful with every turn, so the longer you drag the battle out, the more advantage the enemy has. There's a class system that lets you acquire different useful abilities, and you can choose which ones you want to build with which characters. I'm also a fan of the way there's a space of battle time between giving commands and actually executing those commands, and if you hit an enemy in that space, you interrupt them and slow them down. Certain abilities were better at interrupting but poor at damage, which made for interesting choices.The Penny Arcade script is pretty hilarious, too."

Usually when something is adapted one way or the other it ends up noticeably forced into a box of specific shape.Zeboyd's engine is kind of crappy, unless you're really nostalgic for those 80s menus where you need to reinput commands a bunch of times to view each character's stats or equipment. It also relies on messageboxes with face shots and larger pictures to reveal the narrative, because the sprite engine can't handle cinematic posing. (For comparison, see an in-game cutscene from Final Fantasy Tactics.)The battle system is interesting. I don't think it's balanced right, because some classes just feel useless. Some will deal a few thousand to every enemy, while others will deal just a few hundred. The class combinations and the MP-based attacking work well, though.The story is amazing.

(4/10)Details:What started as amusing jokes quickly became boring nonsense. The protagonists are two idiot adventure-seekers. I found this amusing at first. After playing for a while, I found the made up words and absurd enemies to be juvenile attempts at humor. I occasionally got a laugh, but with classes like ""Hobo"" that inflict ""Hoboism"" the laughs come and go. The game has non-descript classes and abilities with a weak story line.The story line is not unlike what school kids develop when playing an ""Ice Breaker"" game. The one where I'll say a line of a story, then you come up with the next line. ...Yeah, it's something like that. Renegade Mimes and the ""god of Silence"". Okay,The gameplay isn't spectacular either. You have gimmicky skills that, perhaps require some strategy to use. However they aren’t flash(at least early on) and there's no sense of accomplishment. All the battles are fixed & pre-set. You heal automatically between battles. There's no MP management, since all MP is generated in-battle and doesn't carry over. The dungeon crawl is reduced to ""Can I survive the battle?"", which seems completely RNG.I love JRPG's. I've been playing them for decades. I can't get excited about this one.Buy it if you can get it on sale & you're bored; get some cheap laughs. It's not a complete waste of money, but you won't get an edge-of-your-seat story though.

So I had a hint of trepidation when it was revived with a new developer and a completely new art direction. Which I can say, were unfounded.Much like the last two, its a turn based RPG with an impeccably surreal setting with some of the best, most characterised writing in games right now; and the new art direction perhaps better serves the style of comedy of Penny Arcade. Allowing the developers to dip deeper in Gabe and Tycho's twelve year reservoir of inside jokes and references. Its a little more linear than I remember from the last two, but that only results in a more indepth story and a harder, more engaging combat system.And this game's fights are HAAAAAAAAARD. If you go into a big battle unprepared or without a plan, you will get the floor wiped with you. I personally attempted the second final boss at least ten times. You really have to work to find the right formula for each party member, the best equipment, the right classes and how they interact with the rest of the party. There's no infinite well of XP or money (unless you noticed the optional Colosseum), so you have to understand your characters moves and prioritise your every dollar. It can be difficult restarting a battle you thought you had clinched, but the tension only makes the combat more satisifying.This is a fun game, a must play for the avid PA fan not to mention those that fondly love the roots of the RPG (but I'd still recommend playing the first two first). And I honestly hope Zeboyd Games run with this nostalgic aesthetic choice, perhaps make the fourth and final game in the series a callback to the late ninties Playstation RPG's, you all know what I'm referring too."

Gone are the generic combat and the Pee-covered Ultimate Weapons. Instead, we get a well-written comedic RPG that never forgets that it's a game first and an extension of Penny Arcade second."

Just as a back story , since it confused me as well, Hot Head Games made the first two in this series and Zeboyd made the last two. After Precipice of Darkness 2 Hot Head Games devoted their time to the game Deathspank (awesome game series btw) and let Precipice go to Zeboyd (why? i'm not sure) but on to the review. This game retains much of what made the first 2 entries great. Same story same adult humor, it truely feels like it is continuing the story line albeit outside of the normal graphic style. This version no longer has the 3-D ish  style it now harkens back to the earlier Final Fantasy 8 bit era. The character you have been involved with in the first two episodes is gone and they some what explain this briefly.This game definately is worth the buy but you should play the first two to understand it completely. My only real problem with this game was the fact of constantly being reminded that this is only a shadow of its first two itininerations. Had the series started like this there wouldn't be any problems but to me it is like playing the Assassins Creed Series and then in the new version it has you playing the game like Civilization. While it may still be a good game I would keep thinking how much I miss the old Assassins Creed."

Battle Time is used but you have to think ahead as you decide the move a few 'seconds' in advance, meaning an enemy can attack in between deciding and acting which puts a spin on the BT system and makes it a challenge, you can't tank it either as the enemy slowly gains power.This is a good game but it comes with a warning... the difference between Penny Arcade 2 and 3 is chalk and cheese; I feel that it has lost its charm by becoming a pixelated TBS with active time.  Its continuing the story but it isn't a Penny Arcade game.  If you loved the comic book charm of the first 2 games, then I'm sorry but you will be disappointed."

It's turn-based enough to satisfy one's desire to go at the pace you want, but dynamic enough that Speed is a relevent stat. Even if you think Penny Arcade is dumb, or if you think the name is stupid, you should play this game. If there's ever an rpg you liked even a little bit, you should play this game.

Do you honestly enjoy random encounters? Level grinding for hours? Having to save your best items for fights that may not happen? Zeboyd has you covered. Every battle in R-S 3 starts you out with full health and every item you have bought/collected at your disposal. At the end of the battle you get all of that back. You also get 1MP per turn (magic costing up to 9MP) which you can use freely without fear of having to save it for another battle. This creates actually enjoyable gameplay where every battle is a different experience (enemies are already put in groups at pre-set points in every map) that requires tactical planning prior and mid battle.I loved the last two R-S games for being like the Mother/Earthbound games as delightully quirky and fun urban RPGs. R-S 3 manages to continue this trend while being double the length of the last two games (for the better!) and will ALWAYS surprise you. On top of that, you don't actually need to have any knowledge of the former games. Because of that, I actually recommend this game more than the games before it.If you love RPGs you owe it to yourself to play this game. It's cheap, it's fun, and if you ♥♥♥♥♥ about it being too easy, play it on Insane and eat your level grinding heart out (level grinding is optional on easier difficulties!)."

Both that title and Cthulhu Saves the World took Dragon Quest style RPGs and added an element of Douglas Adams style humor to them. But, great as they were I always wanted to see what the pair could do with a more Final Fantasy style aesthetic.PA3 answers that for better and worse.The combat is great, as Zeboyd has made a cool system that combines FFV's (or III, or your favorite FF that has jobs here) job system with a turn system inspired by Grandia.It's fantastic. It's super fun, and each battle feels tightly designed and intentional.But that's the biggest flaw, as well. This game approaches RPG design in a weirdly similar way to Final Fantasy XIII - it's heavily guided. While this allows for great detail and care to be given to each battle, you don't get the enjoyment of exploring, regardless of if that freedom is an illusory veil or not. I don't mind the use of a Mario 3 style map system, but I did wish the actual areas you explored had more freedom and chance to shine. Some cool areas felt like they had more stories to tell.Which is the final part of the puzzle. I enjoyed the story as someone who didn't really play the first two games in this series. I knew going in I was playing a third game that heavily changed the format AND took away Penny Arcade's penchant for foul humor and language. It doesn't really feel like a Penny Arcade story, and that's both a plus and a minus, depending on who is playing.The tl;dr is I enjoyed this game and wrote this review because I'm not sure why it's tagged as an 'RPGMaker game' considering it was developed in the now extinct XNA for Xbox Live Indie Games and Steam. But hey, doesn't really matter."
