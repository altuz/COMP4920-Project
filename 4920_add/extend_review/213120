,Recommended,213120,9224490,"Posted: 22 February, 2014",all,AngryBoz68,"A very good video game representation of the G1 Transformers.  The single player campaign has a strong plot which plays out a bitter war between the Autobots and Decepticons during the final moments of the planet Cybertron.Game primarily playes like a 3rd person corridor shooter.  Game was executed very well so the weapon and movement controls feel really good.  Animations were well done and the robot to vehicle transitions look really good.  The single player campaign will take roughly 10 hours or so on regular difficulty and consists of 15 chapters.  The player does not get to choose which Transformer character they play through the game with the campaign regularly featuring a different character between chapters.  Characters will switch between Autobot and Decepticon depending on which part of the story the player is currently playing and the game appears to feature equal time between the two factions.  Difficulty on normal settings was neither too easy or difficult, but there were times that were a good challenge.  Fortunately the checkpoint system was done well enough that you will not have to redo too much after defeats.Many of the fan favorite characters are featured as playable or ally, and the inclusion of others like Metroplex, the Combaticons, Insecticons and the Dinobots were very welcome.  Both the voice acting and the soundtrack were extremely well done.  This helped create a good feeling of chemistry between the characters and sets the tone of the game.The game does have a multiplayer feature which I have tried only briefly.  It is cool to create a customized Transformer to do battle against or with other players.  I understand that cheating does happen quite regularly but I am hopeful that this will not hurt the experience too badly.  I will review this feature further as I play it more.I had a lot of fun with this game and highly recommend it to those who are G1 Transformer fans."

Despite the majority of movie licensed transformer games being mediocre and even the movies themselves, High Moon Studios strives to revive from the many faults in previous instalments with innovative gameplay and engross players in a compelling story that fans of the series will immediately recognise from the get-go. While the game sounds promising, and lives up to the hype, there is much more than meets the eye here that only scratches a bit off the game’s fine paint job.Fall of Cybertron’s quality and devotion to story-telling, visuals, and production is impressively revamped following its predecessor. While the setting is still within the atmosphere of a war-torn Cybertron that players may be familiar with, it offers a unique variation of the other various environments that have never been explored before. Following the events of the previous game, Fall of Cybertron, as the title suggests, is set during the last days of a fierce and protracted battle which has consequently drained the planet’s supply of energon, a raw energy that the transformers are dependent on. Coming to the realisation that Cybertron can no longer be inhabited, Optimus Prime and the Autobots accumulate what little energon is left to fuel the Ark, a ship that will take them across the galaxy in an attempt to seek refuge and usable energy to survive. The chorological order of the missions keeps players intrigued in the story. The first chapter will have you set in during the last and then play significant events leading up to the conclusion. The story being expressed in this way is very effective because if you were to replay the first chapter after the completing the campaign, you will have an understanding of what drove the transformers to the final showdown. You will play as various members of the Autobots and the Decepticons which are all suited to the environments they are in based on what type of vehicle they transform into and the unique ability that they can use. Any fan from the Generation 1 or Michael Bay series will have a high sense of nostalgia hearing the voice of the prominent Peter Cullen as Optimus Prime once again. Voice acting overall is on point whether it’s one liners coming from fellow NPCs or Optimus Prime’s narration. What adds to the authenticity that reminds players that they are fighting on one side of the war, is the option to converse with other transformers and even at times assist them in completing miscellaneous activities. There are also quick time events that engages players during the more emotional sequences. What may not seem authentic to some players however is  the easter eggs which cannot be disabled but they do encourage going back to different stages for extra replay value which is a good thing. These are relatively well hidden so you probably won’t see a lever turn into a transformer until your second playthrough.  At any time, you can have a primary and heavy weapon which can be utilised by any transformer and there is a good variation from weapons that fire remote detonated globules to an electro-diffraction beam that when fired, can chain kill enemies in proximity of where the beam is directed. You can also rate these weapons according to how useful they are for you which is recorded so that others can see the community ratings for them. This is something that isn’t seen much of in games, but it’s a great way to find out what personal loadout is best for you. Considering that co-op campaign was an option in the previous game that was more popular than the multiplayer itself, I had concerns that the developers had taken a wrong turn. The fact that you could play as different transformers for each chapter really increased my replay value in the previous instalment although I have finish this game 3 times already to obtain the collectibles throughout the campaign. Whether this game would have been better with or without co-op is hard to say, although, because the plot has been designed for each transformer's side of the story to be individualised, it may have had an impact on the story along with its dark and gloomy vibe that the game establishes. Despite the exclusion of this feature, escalation is a mode that allows players to play with friends against hordes of enemies.Escalation is a wave mode that has you play from a selection of transformers including exclusive ones that would not otherwise be present in the campaign. The maps in this mode are inspired by the environments found in the campaign. It offers challenge and a test of your abilities to effectively communicate with the other players and your individual performance. This is more so important in the multiplayer which has taken a turn for the better.Multiplayer makes a return with a little more to offer. A feature that stands out is the freedom of building your own transformer completely from scratch and being able to play it in-game. There are several game modes to choose from including conquest and capture the flag but at the time of this review, you will most likely only get the chance to play team deathmatch since there is such a small player base. There are four classes to choose from, which determine what weapons you can have and what you can transform into. However, these are noticeably imbalanced which encourages players to only choose specific classes. There is also frequent lag which is to be expected for a 5-year-old game which has a handful of online players in-game daily. But this also negatively contributes to the imbalance classes, as choosing weapons that have a high fire rate (which only some classes have) means there is less chance of losing a gun fight whilst experiencing connection issues compared to semi-automatic weapons like the riot cannon, which shoots significantly slower and allows players to easily maneuver out of the line of fire. The classes did feel more balanced on enclosed maps which makes it easier to defeat enemies no matter what class you use.What’s a really important aspect to this game across all modes, is that it’s main focus is gameplay and the ability to do something that you would not otherwise be able to do in most games: transform. Its apparent that all levels have been built from scratch to ensure transforming has a purpose and at times, is mandatory.While the game is still worth purchasing at its current price $50 USD, I would suggest purchasing while it’s on sale especially if you are considering purchasing the DLC add-ons as well.If you have never played a transformers game, you’re probably going to like this game. On the other hand, if you’re a fan, you’ll definitely enjoy this near-masterpiece that will keep you captivated for quite some time. There are plenty memorable moments to be had across all game modes, and it takes the liberty of giving players the nostalgic feel of the G1 series and at the same time, doing what it does best as a third person action shooter which the game is intended to be. No doubt will there be more transformer games pumped out in the future, but could there be one that unleashes its full potential to be become the ultimate transformers game, or is it right in front of us? There is a sequel to this game called Transformers: Rise of the Dark Spark which I’ve played on the PlayStation 4 but unfortunately did not live up to my expectations after the ingeniousness of Fall of Cybertron. I think it’s safe to say though that from the quality of presentation and gameplay and the minor flaws in these areas and online, this is and will be the best game in the series at least for a while.9.5/10Computer specifications and internet connection can influence your gaming experience.

76561198027999270,Recommended,213120,13331751,"Posted: 12 December, 2014",all,Eifersucht18,"“More Than Meets The Eye”Set amongst the burning ruins of a dying planet, ‘Transformers: Fall of Cybertron’ is an exhilarating, at times truly spectacular, Third-Person Action RPG - and is very simply, the single best gaming interpretation of the iconic Transformers franchise.Campaign:Released in 2012 by High Moon Studios | Activision, ‘T:FOC’ is the second entry in the Transformers trilogy and is clearly the series’ high water mark - The opening credits thrust you into the midst of a massive space battle over the destroyed planet of Cybertron, besieged by Decepticon Battle-Cruisers, and front row to the ultimate stand-off between Decepticon supremo, Megatron, and Autobot leader, Optimus Prime. The game then flashes-back 6 days, and drops you in to play through the final few days of the conflict and events leading up to that historic last stand. An engaging story-fueled campaign takes you across a lovingly-crafted, richly atmospheric Transformers universe, putting you in control of popular characters (from both Autobot and Decepticon factions) such as Optimus Prime, Megatron, Starscream, Bumblebee, Cliff-Jumper, Jazz, Grimlock and more.Gameplay | Graphics | Sound:From a technical standpoint, gameplay is a pretty standard Third Person RPG | Shooter | Racer (for the Transformation bits). While there is nothing groundbreaking here, there are several elements that do elevate this title – 1. Unlike other RPG’s where you control one main character throughout, here each of the campaign’s 13 chapters is framed through the viewpoint of a different Transformer allowing the gamer to control many beloved characters each with their own weapon systems, unique transformation, special abilities etc, providing some great overall variety - 2. The game’s pacing is also well constructed with third-person Shooting sections broken up through Stealth, Platforming and Vehicular missions, and intermittent set piece elements that are truly epic in both size and scale. – and finally, 3. A good number of collectibles, upgradable weapons, multiple endings and ultimately, the sheer glee of controlling some legendary characters builds great replayability into this title. Sound Design is also particularly noteworthy, with a grand operatic score accompanied by voice-actors from the original TV-series reprising key roles as Optimus and Megatron. Great graphics, well optimized K&M controls, an ‘Escalation | Survival’ mode, and a highly customizable Multiplayer experience round out a well polished title.Flaws:For all it does well however, one cannot escape the glaring fact that gameplay is rather restrictively linear. Further, an uneven Multiplayer experience (of dropped connections, hacks and exploits, exclusion of the popular Co-op option) in addition to an unseemingly high pricetag of $60 for a 3-yr old title (Note: Steam Sale Price at $15), mar the overall package.Overall, ‘Transformers: Fall of Cybertron’ is a fantastic interpretation of a beloved franchise – and although a pretty average RPG on a technical level - its grand cinematic campaign, breathtaking scale, phenomenal sound design, cast of iconic characters and high replayability, elevate the game to something more than the sum of its parts. This is an ode to the Transformers universe made by fans, for fans – and this is as close to ‘Prime’ as you will ever get – Highly Recommended!

I remember begging my parents to buy me those voyager/leader/ultra class figures so I could re-enact the epic and badass battles between the cunning Decepticons and the heroic Autobots. I grew older, and then I saw the train wreck cash grab of a quadrilogy that Hollywood has produced, and my heart grew heavy. It was hard for me to remember the awesomeness of the story about the fight between good and evil, between Primus and Unicron, between the Autobots and Decepticons. Then I saw this game on sale and gave it a shot. When I first played it, I shed a tear. It was beautiful. The voice acting, the soundtrack, and gameplay made me a 6 year old again. It was very nostalgic and brought me back to the old days of watching those cartoons and playing with the action figures. While the movie industry has failed the franchise, I am very happy that the video game franchise has not. If you are a huge Transformer fan like I am, I would definitely buy this, especially if it is on sale."

,Recommended,213120,23650033,"Posted: 19 June, 2016",all,Tom,"Transformers Fall of Cybertron is a third person action game, developed by Mercenary Technologies and published by Activision – being released in August 2012. Being a bit of a fan of the Transformers franchise, this was my first foray into the games for the series so was quite excited to see what was on offer.The game play is played from the perspective of a number of main characters from the series, you don’t play as a single side of the factions, you swap from side to side which was an interesting way to take the game, throughout the campaign you get times where you will swap characters midway through cut scenes in order to help the story flow better; this was done really well and made the game a much more memorable experience overall. The action in Fall of Cybertron is done really well too; there is an element of cover based combat because as soon as you enter open grounds you tend to just get pummelled into mincemeat by incoming fire so you have to use your environment to your advantage.  All of the characters you play as have their two different forms, these can vary from a car, tank, or planes, all following suite with the lore of the series.  The characters will also come equip with distinct different abilities, some of which are a little out there such as stealth mechanics which didn’t really fit too well, but it was a bit of a change from the norm.Throughout the campaign you’ll run into a number of fights which are done on the larger scale, obviously being a Transformer you are much bigger than most enemies anyway, but some fights take place in large open battlefields where you are really tested against your skill and of course you’ll stand side by side with a city sized autobot which just wrecks anything in its path quite early in the story too so you’ll really want look forward to that!Even though this game is nearing on four years old now, it still looks fairly decent, you can definitely see a bit of the aging come into play when you get up close to some textures, but the majority of the time you are able to forget that this game came out in 2012 because it doesn’t look like it. The animations of characters are really well done, especially the transformation from different forms, I was almost expecting it to go through to a pre-animated cut scene to see these play out but they are all done in engine and real-time which was a pleasant surprise.   Voice acting is spot on with all the veteran voice actors; Peter Cullen and Fred Tatasciore making an appearance which is always a major plus for any franchise game to get the actual voices of the characters involved too.Whilst the majority of the game play from Fall of Cybertron is fairly easy and simple, there were a few times which had me dying a lot. Any mission which involved defending a NPC whilst they carried out a task, always seemed to end up with me dying constantly. After a few attempts I was able to get passed but that is probably down to me being more of an incompetent player. The game does have varying level of difficulties which  you can change on the fly throughout the story mode which is a key factor in getting the longevity out of a single player experience if you ask me – start on the highest difficulty and then work your way down if you find things too tough.The single player mode of Fall of Cybertron took me just over eight hours to complete – this consists of 13 chapters and a decent amount of cut scenes to allow the plot to flow more easily. Whilst there are alternative endings to the game depending on an important decision towards the end, you’ll probably only get enjoyment out of a second play through if you are a real hard core Transformer fan.  It is also sad to say that the multiplayer scene for this game is none existent; I wasn’t even able to find a match to play in so I can’t even comment on whether it was any good or not.Even though I enjoyed Fall of Cybertron, and it’s a good game; I was at no point really looking forward to playing it whenever I booted up my computer. It took me over a week of real life time to actually finish a game, and normally for games like this I can blast out in a day or two; it didn’t have that real WOW factor that a lot of games have now days; even though my review talks mostly about the positives of the game, and even though there are no real negative points it’s still hard for me to recommend this game higher than a mere recommendation for when it is on sale. The premium price tag of £29.99 is way over marketed for what is essentially a single player game with not much replay ability going on.Tom's Score Card1) Stay away2) Not Recommended3) Only recommended when on sale4) Recommended5) Highly recommended6) This is a must playf you found this review helpful, please give it a thumbs up.

Improving on the original title, the combat mechanics are more varied (your robot avatars stealth, platform and fly across the levels as opposed to the first game's lackluster cover-based combat) and there is more variety to the robots themselves. The level design is somewhat improved; the original game was endless halls of metal but there is somewhat more variety in the sequel. Still, compared to the diverse  world-spanning locals of other franchises, the levels can't compare in color or style; it is, after all, based on a robot-planet.Still, while the gameplay is improved it is still not exceptional. It is the robots that are the stars of this show; the Transformers so many of us grew up with. Fighting battles with Jazz, Starscream, Metroplex and Optimus (amongst many others) is something no fan should miss. But I can imagine that people who don't love the franchise might find the experience lacking."

PC multiplayer also a 9/10. Controls are all good, no mouse acceleration issues (COD), the game was ported nicely to PC. Thumbs up to highmoon studios.Back when multiplayer was alive, this game was absolutely wonderful in that regard. There was a nice skill gap that wasn't too harsh if you get what I mean. After I primed and started my ranking over from zero again, I could still destroy people with my character because I was far more experienced and skilled in the game than my opposiiton, no matter what level they were or what high level abilities and guns they used.The great thing about this games multiplayer is that it's like CSGO and COD Advanced Warfare met halfway with the skill gap. It wasn't just a run around and hope for a kill kind of arcade shooter, but it also wasn't down to the memorizing the map flow and gun recoil patterns either. The placement of the skill gap was set perfectly to where if you could manuever your character well enough, go for some headshots and be a hard target to hit, you would win everyone 1v1 fight. With enough of a drop on the enemy, I could 1v2 two destroyers or tanks with my scout class. It was just a matter of skill.So all in all, 10/10 campaign, and 9/10 multiplayer (would be 10/10 if you could change your keyboard/controller buttons)This game honestly deserves the popolarity and longevity of Call of Duty. I'm not asking for TF Fall of Cybertron 6, like the repititous COD titles, but I wish the community for this game lasted like COD4. There is absolutely nothing better than the feeling of transforming your custom made character in-game and flying/driving around in-game.As said before, I 100% recommend this game to fulfill your singleplayer transformers needs, but if you came for the multiplayer... I'm sorry to say I do not recommend because it is long gone. R.I.P. (10-01-2015)- - - Hats off to HighMoon Studios - - -"

The game does feel a bit limited at times.  I had the urge to go through levels in a free play mode, but none existed.  I would love to tumble through any level with any character.Multiplayer is fairly straightforward on the game, and very entertaining.  Found it pretty decent for the incoming expectations of the game.  All the same I would play the multiplayer again.  There wasn't a lot of connection issues while trying to get onto the online server for multiplay.All together it's a pretty decent game that seemed to be well played out.  I think it's fairly enjoyable and worth buying.  I couldn't determine a good reason not to get the game."

I will not be denied!"" shouts Megatron as he sucked into the wormhole that will transport him and his nemesis, Optimus Prime, to Earth. Meanwhile I am laughing my♥♥♥♥♥off thanks to the excellent and wonderful delivery of the line.Fall of Cybertron is a cartoon game at heart. Despite all its masked brutality and complicated linguo, it still is just a series of escapades, played out by rightly coloured robots that can transform into a variety of vehicles. And this is fine. Because, saturday morning Transformers are the transformers we have come to love. Fall of Cybertron then is a modern take on the cartoon; a streamlined version of it, that does away with the thick layer of moral correctness and exchanges it for witty humour and flashy action. Perfect for the crowd of today.However, this is not a cartoon. This is a game. A short game, I will admit, but a fun one. Fall of Cybertron is fast and varied. It is a third-persoon shooter with vehicle elements. It is a mix of speed and finesse that is fun to play and to watch. The campaign puts you in the armour of a different Transformer in every stage, while the mulitplayer mode allows you to build your own and take the fight to those pesky autobots or decepticons. The story mode is about 10 stages long and chronicles the final days of Cybertron. For those of you who are unfamilliar with Transformers lore, here is the synopsis: Cybertron is out of power and the decepticons still want more. When they hear the Autobots are preparing to leave the planet they attack to steal all their fuel so they can advance their goals of galactic conquest. Everything is delivered by a top-of-the-bill voicecast that holds nothing back to create a genuine Transformers experience.The game does know a few shortcomings however. It is short. The campaign won't take much effort for a seasoned gamer and the split between vehicle and robot is a bit arbitrary at times. It comes down to preference in what mode you'd prefer to play, but some stages can be blitzed with little to no effort if you just tote the main gun from your Tank transformation. Multiplayer suffers from its regular slow-start hiccups. Everyone is level 40 and has planet destroyers while you try to make due with your slingshot and balloon shield. It is a hurdle, and since the rewards are always less appetising than the stuff you can unlock through purchacing DLC you might end up wondering if it is actually worth the time investment.I would sign off with a ""Transform and Roll Out!"" joke, but since this game doesn't have any real cars (they're all hovermobiles) it would seem out of place. So I return to my first sentence: ""I will not be denied!"" If this game comes up in a sale, shell some cash, and play some of this sweet robot action."

The combat is fluent and fun, and the story line is extremely well written and developed. However, this game is only half complete. The multiplayer is broken for anyone new to the game. It seems that anyone who bought the game before February 2016 can participate in multiplayer gameplay without any hassle. Yet for those of us who have bought it since then are being cheated out of half the advertised game. I'm personally disgusted that Activision and Steam would advertise this as a complete title and sell unusable dlc along with the base game, knowing that that section of the game is unusable.Don't buy this game.

I was ecstatic when I first saw War for Cybertron's trailer. I did buy it right away when it had been released. I loved it, I thought it was just outstanding. And now here we have Fall of Cybertron, way much better than the previous one in general but if I had to choose one of them, I would go for War for Cybertron. FOC's multiplayer is better but in WFC's story mode you can choose 3 different characters per mission. So that is a good bonus. And the other thing that I want to mention about is, in FOC you only have 13 chapters to play, then you're done. But in WFC, Autobots and Decepticons have their own stories, campaigns and endings, which I find more decent.But I do recommend them both, they are all just fantastic. Absolutely worth their price."

It is story-driven game, but the story is better than any Michael Bay's scrap and on the same level as Transformers: Prime tv show (just a little bit darker).  It's more like revamped classic Transformers from 80's. The design of transformers is high and resembles G1 design. Voice over is just 10/10.There are tons of fun in multiplayer. You can create your own Autobot or Decepticon from available parts. Unfortunately you can't pick a side in multiplayer, the game does that for you to balance teams. Sometimes it chooses Autobot side which is so beneath me and defies my logic. Though when you host Escalation mode you can pick a side. In this mode you can choose any iconic transformer like Lord Megatron himself.If you are only after the story, you can just watch walkthrough on youtube as the story is pretty much linear and you literally watch it like a movie.

,Recommended,213120,33050778,Posted: 30 June,all,Kryyss,"""God is in the details."" A rather broad statement which when taken in its intended context means that when looking at the details of the universe such as the fact that all life on earth is written in the same genetic language and that the laws of the known universe are so intricately interlinked and dependant upon each other that these things in themselves reasonably prove that an intelligence is behind their existance and design. However, taken in an aesthetic context it's really about the difference between what seperates something average from something truely devine.Before I start, this is a SPOILER FREE review as none of the major plot points are revealed however I will mention characters that appear.Fall of Cybertron and War of Cybertron come from the same studio, follow the same basic formula, the same themes and for all intents and purposes could be considered twins. However, the effort put into the details make one an epic experience while the other is simply an average but fun romp through a modern take on the beloved franchise.WfC was a clunky and questionally paced game that ultimately too took long to get to the fun, however FoC nails the pacing perfectly. From the opening tutorial being integrated into the storyline itself to how the game is more interested in being entertaining rather than challenging you can see that the developers really learned a lot from the previous game in the series. FoC is nothing short of an interactive series of Transformers episodes due to how it endlessly strings one set-peice into another with gameplay intermixed. The opening of the game is a set-peice, the 2nd chapter is one giant set-peice, the 3rd chapter is riddled with lots of little set-peices and the game just keeps throwing more and more memorable moments and carefully scripted events at you one after another.Despite the controls still being unchangable without a third party tool such asKeyTweakthe game has come a long way towards being more responsive to player input. The cover-mechanics are largely unchanged but the level design is now far more forgiving by offering you many pillars and tall objects which provide better protection than the barracades and L-bends that the previous game kept offering you. Grenades are out and heavy-weapons take their place as a secondary weapon and this feels far better as you can easily switch back and forth while consumables replace the abilities from the previous game and are sensibly placed on the 1 and 2 keys. Shift for dash or rise in vehicle mode with ctrl being down for your aircraft. It overcomes many of the finger acrobatics needed to make full use of your character in WfC. The developers have also done away with the 3-man squad mechancis that were more of a hinderance than a help in WfC.As before the excellent voice acting and well developed character personalities return and real effort has been made to make the chapters themselves enchance the characters themselves. The smart and commanding Optimus Prime is given a battle-field to traverse with critical objectives looming in the distance giving weight to his importance, Cliffjumper and Jazz appear in a more confined chapter where their banter lightens their mood and varied skills fit with level design while advancing the storyline in a sensible way, Starscream's quest for revenge, Grimlok's rampage and all of the many other activities all make perfect sense for the characters you are given to play and that in itself really helps you to enjoy the storyline. The music itself is also far better than WfC as it matches the mood perfectly and there are some truely epic soundtracks that enhance the on-screen events even further.In terms of challenge, FoC is not going to have you struggling much of the time. There are the occasional moments in the game which will take a couple of attempts but in general the game is more interested in advancing the storyline ala Mass Effect by keeping you moving forwards with minimal downtime. There are two endings to the game but in all honesty I wouldn't really call them alternate endings as you simply get to choose to play the final boss-battle as one of two key characters.This game literally had me smiling from ear to ear towards the end and when I noticed that the story was wrapping up I was genuinely sad to see it end as this quality of entertainment is a rare thing in games these days. It is so nice to have something which is designed to be fun first and challenging second and packed with so much personality that you can't help but feel engaged with what is happening on-screen. Normally you don't see that design ethic from any studio except for Nintendo.Fall of Cybertron is a fantastic game and well worth the full price let alone a great deal if you happen to get it on sale."

Although, if this had a completely different subject to it I don't think it would be any less of a great narrative. As compared to War of Cybertron, where you have a linear narrative of all autobots, then all deceptacons where you get to play as your favorite 'con (between the 3 given) done in a team of 3 in a basic third person shooter style seen in many other games before it. The game was alright. Then this game was revealed, and they changed everything. It's still a linear first person shooter yeah, but they changed up the way they did the narrative. Instead of picking a 'con, you're given the one for the job, with each having a unique ability set to go well with the mission you use them in. An assault on a base? Here's Megatron with a cannon. A mission where you're suggested to take a sneaky approach, here's Cliff Jumper with a stealth ability. Sniping? Here's Jazz with a grapple and sniper rifle; and it just goes on from there. This allows for a much more diverse level setup than War did and it shows. You go from the surface of Cybertron, to deep underground, to out in deep space all in the span of a 8-10 hour campaign, and that's if you don't seek out collectibles for 100% completion. I do want to make mention of the music. I really didn't think a game like this would be able to pull off good cinematic music the way it does, but it surprised me in that department. There's also multiplayer, but that really wasn't all that great. I played 1-2 hours of the multiplayer, and it's nothing special. You got your horde mode, you got your team deathmatch and a few other versus modes, but it'd be like almost any other third person shooter with a tacked on multiplayer, and really I'm going to take some points off of my score for that. I feel they could have added a bit more to the single player and polished it just a bit more if they didn't include the multiplayer. Overall I would say the game is an 8/10. If you like a good linear narrative and enjoy giant killer robots, than this is worth a look."

Bigger, arguably better, and crammed with more of the stuff Transformers fans want - like Dinobots and Insecticons. The gameplay remains relatively unchanged, but there's a more linear nature to preceedings, doing away with optional three-player co-op and instead guiding players down a strict narrative. I find that this is an improvement - the story, I think, is worth sacrificing the nontheless appealing co-op features.More Transformers goodness, made by honest-to-god Transformers fans, for Transformers fans, hooked along on shooter gameplay that is enjoyable in its own right.

76561198025937906,Recommended,213120,29077302,Posted: 6 January,all,Tzardok,"If you like the glorious G1 transformers, I think this game will do it justice.To date this is by far the best transfomers game to me, mainly for all things G1 and gameplay. It improves over the previous game (War for Cybertron) and together these are the only legitimate G1 transformers games in my opinion, even if they are introducing new story elements which previously were either untold or modified to fit the current times we live on. I judge the risks taken are good and spot on, They remain true to the aspirations and characters we know and care for. If you watched the original show as I did back then, some characters may seem out of place (a group of 5 Autobots specifically, as they were indroduced in the show and hence, after the events of the fall of Cybertron), but the explanation for these characters to be on Cybertron are so much better than the kids show did back then, things make sense while being as close as possible to the source material.Voice overs are excellent and some of the original cast is there, but not all are, everyone does an excellent job however. The developers showed a huge respect for the franchise, staying true to characters personalities and interactions between them, some are hilarious and others consistent with expectations from the show, which is great.The action is really good if you like that cover and shoot mechanic, while there is no cover function as in other games, you need to find angles that provide protection and advantage all the time, otherwise you are toast. The flow of battle just works and there is hardly any dull moment section by section. If you play Hard difficulty you will get that guerrila warfare feeling while normal and easy will allow you to move quicker as enemies will die faster and you take more chances due to higher survivability.While there is no CO-OP campaign as it did on the 1st game, the story and levels are much better constructed and delivered. I kinda wished to play those levels with friends, but if keeping it as a single player made this awesome story progression possible, I accept the removal of co-op. Seriously.Multiplayer has the escalation mode, which is an improvement over the previous one, but not a major overhaul neither. Having more levels is welcome (4 vs 2 from the original). The standard PVPs and other modes are fun, but the population playing this game has shrunked significantly now days so it should not be considered viable if you like PVP.The best addition this game made over the original is the ability to switch the weapons between hands, allowing better use of cover, I still cannot understand why this was not in the first game. It deserves to be mentioned here as this is a slight change that has a huge but positive impact on the gameplay.As for annoying things, I guess the rating system for each weapon and upgrade is the worst. There is an achievement linked to this, which is not hard but rather annoying to do. I get that they wanted to know which ones were community favorites and which weren't for future games that never came, but I would still dispense the rating system.I must leave a warning however, despite how great and awesome War for Cybertron and Fall of Cybertron are, stay away from the pretender for 3rd game that tries to make it a trilogy, it is a different game by a different studio which uses assets from this great series but delivers ultimate disappointment by mixing in the Michael Bay transformers and movie lore, which is a totally different universe and should not mix with G1 at all, it just became confusing and lost purpose.With that said, I am not sure if we will get the chance, but I hope for a real third game in the Cybertron series, by that I mean all G1 and no Michael Bay's transformers. I want the G1 with the same respect to the lore and gameplay as Fall of Cybertron delivered. Perhaps an open-world /sandbox game with the Transformers on Earth? Who knows, it will be long before we get a studio that was this passionate and respectful to G1 as High Moon studios was.Cheers!"

I am a big transformers fan so my view is slightly biased.- LikesTransforming feels useful, your alt mode can actually do you a lot of good when you're using it correctly, just becareful if you try to transform to run away you'll more likely to end up dying.Varied weaponsDecent health, I don't die a few seconds after I spawn like battlefield.Great voice acting,Soundtrack is amazing partiulary the map room, sadly not included in the soundtrack.- DislikesThe flying modes while fast (which is what you need) work on a horizontal plane. So you can go up and down but you can't go upside down. Many of the areas in the multiplayer map are cut off to you can you can end up getting jammed into objects which hit boxes are just badly designed. So much more could have been down with this. Such as flying through vertical tight spaces.Transformation customisation is bad, while it takes a lot of work so much more could have been done to show customised parts in vehicle mode. Even so when you use the correct parts it's still looks quite tacky. Certian parts just look flat with textures place on top.  Still there's credit due with the complexity of these designs.Dialouge seems somewhat tacky, (there is no greater sacrifice than in freedom) not the erxact words but OP says this and I think... well that's a bit extreme. How many are you willing to slauter till you're satified Prime?Multiplayer ocassionally have cheaters, also due to the nature of joining games you don't get to choose which match you're placed into. There's no system in place to ban them, so all you can do is leave the server and try and find another one. Or try to be a bad♥♥♥♥♥and take them on.

It's got a great story, ( Mainly because it doesn't have any continuity with the recent filmss. ) very smooth mechanics, great voice acting, high quality animations, and a very well balanced system between the use of your robot and alternate forms. The Multiplayer is great, with one of the best (mecha) character customization you'll get from any game. The different verity of forms that you can transform into is astounding, as you can have your character transform into a car, truck, jet, helicopter, insects and even a few dinosaurs.I do however recommend that you play the prequel, Transformers: War For Cybertron, before playing this. The game is relatively cheap at the moment and is worth the time and money to understand what is going on in this game.If I had to recommed one set of DLC, I would buy the ""Massive Fury Pack"" as it has some extra weapons that is used for single player, and a few skin packs for Multiplayer, but It's not required to enjoy the game.One of the best parts about the single player campage is that the there is an upgrade system that is carried over to the next character you play as in the story reguarless of who your playing as, with a few exceptions. ( For good reason. )If I had to complain about one thing in the game, it is the final boss fight, as it was ridiculously difficult. ( But that might have been my fault since I played through the game on Hard from the start. )Other then that, great game over all. 8.5 out of 10. Highly recommended."

The game itself is a complete throwback to the original G1 series. It's very clear that the developers of the game put their hearts and souls into making this game, and many references to the G1 series can be seen in this game, which is an excellent nod to the fans. Story-wise, the game takes place on a war-ravaged Cybertron, with both the Autobots and Decepticons competeing for Energon and power in order to take orbit. Almost every G1 character is represented in this game, and Peter Cullen reprises his role as Optimus Prime. The inclusion of the Dinobots instantly makes this game superior to War for Cybertron, which was alredy an excellent game itself. Metroplex makes an appearence, also, which was a great thing to see. All of the characters are true to their G1 selves, Honorable Optimus, Traitorus Starscream, King Grimlock etc. The entire game has solid voice acting, which is a great thing to see in a game like this. In terms of gameplay, it's very similar to War for Cybertron, but improves further upon that. The controlls, whilst un-customizable, work perfectly for Mouse and Keyboard. Also, it's worth noting that this is an excellent PC port. I played through the game at a constant 60 FPS @ 1080p, without experiencing any stuttering or crashes.Overall, I would definatley recommend Transformers: Fall fo Cybertron.

They're fun - with the occasional, more palpable wave of ""hey this is fun!"" washing over you. Ultimately, though, I'm left with the feeling that I'm not having the optimal good time. That's not really the game's fault. The part where it's a game, I mean. It's just... I dunno, it's hard to put your finger on.They have some characterisation on the part of the robots, and they give you some fanservicy ""hey, stomp things as Grimlock"" moments in this game, but it all just seems kinda modest. Where are the nefarious plots, the in-fighting, the politics and the clashing ideologies? Maybe it's ""too soon"" to get that stuff out before they're even off the planet, but the result is a bit of a vacuum in the story and between the characters. As a game it's really everything it needs to be. Arcadey and blasty and transforming makes you feel good. It could just go wilder with *the other bits*.Do I recommend it? Oh, absolutely.

Aside from liking Beast Wars a lot when I was younger I was never really in to Transformers. Playing through War for Cybertron and then Fall of Cybertron has made me much more of a fan of the entire franchise. Although Fall loses the ability to play through the entire campaign with 4 player online co-op that War had, it makes up for it by having the campaign diverse and unique. Each set piece is incredible, and you are given control of different transformers and decepticon's through out the story. Complete with upgradable weapons and finding blue prints for new weapons through out the game, you can also find audio logs that expand upon the lore for those interested. My only gripe about the game is that the multiplayer community has really died out. Some of the modes I tried to play I couldn't due to lack of players. I had a good time with the multiplayer survival mode and the team death match, though, and managed to find games for those two game types whenever I tried.

Micheal Bay completely disappointed me with his films. Even Peter Cullen saying ""I am Optimus Prime"" couldn't redeem those movies for me. But along came High Moon studios, and War for Cybertron. And it was fantastic. Still had Peter Cullen, but Peter Cullen playing the Optimus Prime I knew and loved of my childhood. It was a fantastic game. Great action, great charecters, great set piece moments with ""OMG NO WAY IS THAT"" recollections of favorite charecters appearing. It was great.How could a sequel compare? Well, Fall of Cybertron takes a great game, and dials it up even further. This takes all the stuff that made the last game great, and adds to them. It gives you more great moments, and amps them up. Using metroplex to waste an Deceptacon army, or playing as a combiner against the autobots, they're just so many points where any transformers nerd would be gitty about.The charecters once again are still amazing, and we add several more to the game. If I had one complaint, I suppose it might be I dont get to play as my favorites all the time, but then, I would miss out on some of these other great moments and charecters, so that complaint falls a bit short. Fan favorites all over the game, this really is a love letter to Transformers.Gameplay once again, they added more to it to make an even better game than the first. I mentioned those charecters, well High Moon has done an amazing job making all of those charecters play very differently. From a juggernaught that lays waste to all before it, to a stealth charecter sneaking around and assinated enemy bots, or a bionic commando like grappler who moves all around the play area. It is just fantastic, and a lot of fun.And the story is great. No, we are not talking Oscar winning great, but as a Transformer story, it is a cut above anything Micheal Bay is giving, and honestly well above plenty of other games out there.

Sure I've watched a couple of episodes, but it just didn't hook me. Why? To this day I don't know. What's cooler than transforming robots? Not a lot. I suppose if it was anything, it'd be Starscream. He's the worst combination of everything. Incredibly unintelligent, self centered, fails at virtually everything he does, overconfident, acts like how an evil 10 year old would and has the absolute most annoying voice I have ever heard.So if you couldn't tell.....I despise Starscream and I don't understand why he became a popular character. And it's the only reason I can think of for not watching the original Transformers show. However, I really enjoyed the game (even the Starscream part despite me hating him with a passion). It feels smoother than the first and allows you to play as more of the iconic characters. Unlocking upgrades to pulverize your enemies is fun and it was very unique playing as Bruticus and Grimlock.Escalation is just as fun as it is in War for Cybertron. Same with PvP. The only negatives I have is:-Definitely shorter than the original and I felt like the story was too rushed-Vehicle mechanics felt a little clunkier-While I knew High Moon announced they removed this because ""it's too hard"".....no co-op-Microtransactions-The ending didn't feel satisfying enoughI definitely recommend this as it's a great sequel to WFC. If you haven't played either of them I would rather recommend the first title. I think it's an overall better experience. But you will not regret this purchase either."

The game is a prequel of sorts, taking place during the autobot construction of the Ark, prior to when the planet cybertron is completely destroyed.I haven't played the multiplayer that the game has to offer, but for the sales price tag, the single player alone was a really good deal.  The game itself is extremely well done, the voice acting is top notch.  Hats off to the team for putting together Peter Cullen (Prime) and Frank Welker (Megatron) to help make the game feel complete.  The old-style models come to life, and the gameplay itself is engaging and fun and action oriented.  The way that the campaign switches you between autobot and decepticon really helps relive that childhood feeling where the show would often times bounce back and forth between the two factions.Transformers may not be for everyone.  For me, it's a huge shout out to my youth, especially since I still have some of the original G1 toys in an old box in my closet.  If you aren't a fan of the franchise or the toys, it might still be an enjoyable action oriented robot shooting game.  It's a ""low thought"" type game where you just load it up and start charging in, guns blazing.Having beaten the game, the only other thing I wanted to mention is that I really appreciate what the developers and studio put in there during the credits.  I won't spoil it, but it's definitely worth beating the game to watch the end sequence.  Well done!"

76561198027919138,Recommended,213120,22167894,"Posted: 31 March, 2016",all,Mystacron,"FOC breathes new life into the story of Cybertron and the ongoing battle between the iconic Autobots and the Decepticons. The game feels different to it's predecessor WFC in the sense of its improved interaction with the environment (i.e. the stylish abilities unique to each character in each mission) as well as weapon upgrades. Let me summarise it for you.Pros:*The storyline is epic and includes my most favourite transformer characters of all time (Optimus Prime, Bumblebee, Soundwave and Grimlock along with a load more) and really digs into the lore that makes up the Transformers universe and the events that lead up to the G1 tv series (for any of you that don't know what that means, Google's there to help).*The weapons are fun and great to combo with (cycling from vehicle mode to robot mode to unleash hell on some puny decepticons while I laugh like a sadistic maniac.)*2 Words - GRIMLOCK. DINOBOTS. Enough said.*The multiplayer was tons of fun before it got shut down by December last year (such a shame High Moon couldn't keep it going) you could customize your own transformers from 4 different classes (Scout, Destroyer, Tank and Scientist) with tons of abilities/weapons/paint jobs to choose from.(Decepti) Cons:*The multiplayer along with escalation shutting down - if they hadn't this wouldn't be on my cons list, they were that good.*The lack of missions for bigger characters (i.e. Grimlock only has 2 missions in the entire game and is never seen again until you buy a dlc pack that adds his t-rex vehicle mode in multiplayer) It would've been so cool if you could play him in more missions or have him as a playable character for most of them (even though he'd probably be way too op for it!)"
,Recommended,213120,14900781,"Posted: 15 March, 2015",all,Eltanin,"A must buy for all Transformers fans.Fall of Cybertron is a prime example and perhaps one of the best examples of a licenced game done well. Everything in it from the environments, to the lore, to the characters and voice actors all magnificently capture the essense and feel that makes Transformers Transformers. In remembrance to myWar for Cybertron review, I shall now list 30 things off the top of my head that makes Transformers Fall of Cybertron a great game:1. It's got friggin' Transformers2. You get to play as all the iconic and memorable characters from the franchise3. All of the controls have been streamlined and refined in transition from the last game making for a fantastic gaming experience4. Varied and extremely well paced levels based on which Transformer you play as meaning you will never get bored as you play!5. You get to be complete badasses as all of the guys you play as but even more so as BRUTICUS AND GRIMLOCK6. Peter Cullen reprises his role as Optimus Prime in addition to the remaining extremely talented cast who played all of their parts to perfection. The voice acting in this game truly is some of the best in the medium.7. True to form and true to name. Everything in the game is what one would expect of a Transformers Cybertron game and even more.8. A gripping narrative that explores the last dying hours of Cybertron; a tale truly remarkable, one of civil war, struggle, freedom, camaraderie, loss and hope.9. Well rounded, extremely likeable, very memorable, nostalgia-inducing cast of characters that will make you love the franchise even if you have never watched or played a single Transformers show or game.10. Wonderfully crafted environments that really make you feel that you are in a dying planet ravaged by centuries of warfare.11. Incredible character models and animations that make transformations so seemless, robot movements so natural and moving, transforming environments that really make you feel that you are in a living, breathing world.12. Everything that made the first game (sans Co-op) made it to the sequel... BUT WITH MORE! You can now sprint, dodge, and air dash!13. All of the new additions above made playing as the Transformers feel like you're actually playing as trained warriors as opposed to simply walking behemoths with big guns... Now, you can be a walking behemoth with big guns AND ALSO BE MORE BADASS BY USING BADASS EVASIVE MANEUVERS!14. The game does a fantastic introduction wherein you actually play in the final chapter and then the next chapters have you revisiting events that happened before that final chapter in order for you to find out about all of the things that lead to said finale. In other words, the game throws you into THE most intense moments of the narrative as the INTRODUCTION, and IT WAS FANTASTIC.15. One may think that because they showed you the most intense moments in the first chapter since the first chapter is also the final chapter, the rest of the game wouldn't be as exciting... WRONG! This game is filled with what can be coined as ""♥♥♥♥ yeah!"" moments wherein there are these moments that are so damn epic that you just can't help and clench your fist and position your arms into a victorious pose all while saying, whispering or even screaming ""♥♥♥♥ Yeah!"". And this game, is FILLED with it.16. The actual final chapter, once you play it, is EVEN MORE INTENSE than when you first experienced it. It is absolutely MINDBLOWING.17. Remember how I talked about those ""♥♥♥♥ Yeah!"" moments? Grimlock's Transformation, that is all.18. You know what, I lied. Here's another: Friggin' Metroplex19. Incredible dialogue, fantastic one-liners, war banters and Transformer Jargon that are all music to your ears.20. You thought being able to transform from a robot to a vehicle is cool? Well then, how about playing as a Transformer who can transform into a robot, a helicopter AND a jet! How's that for cool.21. If that's not cool enough, said character can transform and MERGE with his friends to create an EVEN BIGGER BADASS robot!22. Transforming isn't a gimmick! In a third person shooter, one might think that the transformations are just a feature that one might not even need in order to play but nope. The transformation mechanic has been incredibly integrated into the gameplay that feels natural and intuitive!23. Its awesome multiplayer is still alive and kicking, even after 3 years since its release!24. THAT SOUNDTRACK! Holy crap, I really wish High Moon studios released the official soundtrack because I would've bought that in a heartbeat.25. While a lot of the levels in War for Cybertron were amazing, they also felt a bit constrained because a majority of them took place indoors and so, within closed spaces. Fall of Cybertron however really takes its game engine to the limit by giving you vast and open battlefields that are never resting, always moving with constant gunfire and air skirmishes being witnessed happening in the background. This game really showcases Cybertron's finest sceneries...even if those sceneries may have been ravished, wartorn and dying.26. DINOBOTS!!!27. REFERENCES! Lots and lots of references! This game is filled with shoutouts, omages and references to previous works in the franchise and those who would recognise them are sure to have a blast! (from the past!)28. Intense and unforgiving yet completely fair gameplay. This game can get pretty hard at times especially if you set it so, but whenever you die, you will die because you were being stupid. You won't ever feel that the game was being unfair because of unfair mechanics or sudden surprise pitfalls, you will be dying because you did something stupid and you took too much damage or you were too impatient.29. Incredible execution of quick time events! There aren't that many in this game but whenever there are, they never feel tedious and only happen often enough to maximise your immersion as the character you are playing as. Not to mention doing them feels so good.30. This is a game made of passion and love for franchise and you will see, feel and hear it as you play it. This is undoubtedly a Transformers game made by developers with a deep love for the franchise for players who also have a deep love for the franchise.I'll reiterate by saying that: Even if you have never played a Transformers game or watched a Transformers show, if you play this amazing game, then you will undoubtedly love it by the end of it."

The Autobot's last hope for saving their race is to launch the Ark through a portal to a distant planet until the planet is able to 'reboot' itself. Of course, the Decepticons don't plan on going down with the ship, and resent the idea of someone leaving them behind.If you were a fan of the 80's cartoon, this game, more or less, leads RIGHT into that show, minus a few continuity errors. (in the show, Wheeljack 'invented' the Dinobots, Starscream 'invented' the Combaticons; but in the game both groups are already frontline forces). None of that matters though.Bypassing WFC's class-based system, FoC has character-based levels, with each level showcasing the talents of that Character's level, from Optimus Prime's Run-and-Gun levels, Cliffjumper's stealth levels (which I loved), Jazz's 'speed sniper' levels, or Bruticus' ""DESTROY IT ALL"" levels.The story is told very well, and the game is amazing. My only complaints are that some playstyles were a little more fun than others (again, I loved Cliffjumpers stealth sequences, didn't care so much for Vortex's 'fly here, destroy that' sequence). The biggest complaint I had while playing was that the Teletran1 upgrade screens didn't 'work' with the control pad, and I was required to use the mouse and keyboard to navigate that segment of the game, meaning I couldn't just run this on TV in Big-Pic mode. Acceptable for the quality of the game.All in all, I recommend it. Get the game, play the game, see what I mean."

They are a faithful depiction of the G1 series without being over the top and utterly ridiculous (unless giant robots killing each other is ridiculous...then it is ridiculous). The soundtrack for Fall of Cybertron is epic, and the entire series really sets the dark gritty desperation of the Autobots vs. Deception war and the exodus to earth.However, word of warning the next installment is not being produced by High Moon, and is a mixing of this universe and Michael Bays Throw Up explosion transformers, so I suggest these two games, but no further."

,Recommended,213120,10168763,"Posted: 19 May, 2014",all,Heathen,"For someone who watched a lot of early morning cartoons back in the Eighties, this game is a welcome nostalgia hit. The characterisation is excellent and the game hits all the right buttons in terms of fan service (which I won't spoil by revealing too much here).The story, while cartoonish, is consistent with the tone and history of the Transformers animated series, and transforming - complete with that iconic folding metal sound - never gets old. Note, though, that the game is set before the Transformers came to earth, so Bumblebee isn't turning into a Camaro nor Optimus Prime into a big rig.Fall of Cybertron is good fun. While the gameplay is fairly basic,  enough variety to keep you involved comes from playing the different autobots and decepticons, each of whom have their own abilities. It's a little slow to get started, and the controls feel a bit sluggish at first, but it's worth persisting with.A minor point - I was somewhat confused by a shop that allows you to purchase weapons and mods throughout the game. It seemed pointless given lots of weapons were scattered around the maps anyway. Scrounging around for ammo for the second weapon got a bit tedious after a while, too. However, as I played the game on easy, I got away with using my default weapon a lot of the time.The scenery is a little dull - Cybertron is not that interesting a planet to explore, frankly - and  though the game designers threw in a few different environments to change things up a little, I look forward to a next (i..e., current) gen sequel set on Earth, with a bit more attention spent on the scenery.Verdict: play it if you loved the old cartoons, and were disappointed in the movies, but wait for it to go on sale."

,Recommended,213120,8605701,"Posted: 7 January, 2014",all,TheCrimsonGhost,"High Moon Studio’s retelling of the Transformers’ escape from their dying planet Cybertron was left unfinished in 2010’s Transformers: War for Cybertron. In its sequel, Transformers: Fall of Cybertron, continues the story of the Autobot/Decepticon civil war, reintroduces familiar characters from the cartoon series, and delivers the action-packed gameplay of the original – with a few changes.Fall of Cybertron takes place directly after the events of the previous game, with Optimus and the Autobots preparing their deep-space ship, known as the Ark, for evacuation from the mechanical planet. The campaign is structured differently from the previous title. Instead of two separate campaigns – Autobot and Decepticon – as seen in the prior game, Fall of Cybertron takes you through a single storyline that alternates between the two sides. For instance, in one mission, you’ll play as Optimus Prime as he attempts to secure Energon resources for the Ark’s evacuation. In the next, you’ll take control of the Decepticon, Vortex, as he sabotages the Autobot transport carrying that same Energon supply. You’ll see both sides of the conflict firsthand, which is great for those who enjoyed the dual perspective of the first game. But that’s not all that’s changed.Fall of Cybertron forgoes the three-player co-op from the previous title, which in turn, negates the ability to choose the character you play in each level. You no longer have two companion characters following you around. Instead, characters like Jazz will move about the background, guide you through levels, and keep up the banter as you stealthily infiltrate a Decepticon base as the mission’s designated Autobot, Cliffjumper. Each level is crafted with the transformer’s abilities in mind. In some missions, you’ll play as Optimus with a heavy emphasis on shooting or you’ll do some platforming as the acrobatic Jazz, while others let you take to the skies as Starscream in amazing aerial/ground hybrid levels.Each level type is fun in its own right. The shooting sections are solid, stealth missions go without a hitch, and aerial assaults are a blast. However, the melee-focused Dinobot section of the campaign is far from enjoyable. Rather than running into battle guns blazing, firing off missile launchers, and transforming at a moment’s notice to rain-down a bombardment of explosives on enemy lines, you’re forced to continuously mash the melee button and watch the same combo animation over and over, as you wail on Insecticons. The entire section was completely out of place and drags on for far too long. Even the instant ability to transform is taken away in exchange for a rage meter that (once filled) allows you to activate your T-Rex form.Overall, the gameplay feels tighter and more focused. However, the inability to play as or interact with a larger roster of characters is disappointing. You’ll see plenty of familiar characters, like Ironhide and Shockwave, but you won’t be able to interact with most of them in more than a short dialogue exchange. It is also a missed opportunity that the more prominent characters don’t play boss roles to fill the overall lack of boss battles. Instead, you’re stuck fighting generic, larger-than-usual transformers as they show up as “sort-of” mini-bosses to replace the massive boss encounters of the first game.After you finish the campaign, the multiplayer and Escalation modes provide a great reason to come back to Fall of Cybertron. Not much has changed from War for Cybertron’s multiplayer, but engaging giant robots in a gun battle is just as fun as before. Successful kills and captured objectives earn experience points to unlock more weapons and upgrades, and you can customize your Autobot and Decepticons with armor parts to make them stand out from the crowd.Escalation – the Transformers version of Horde mode – is especially addicting. Players face wave after wave of hostile transformers. You’ll choose from four character classes, each with unique support abilities including a projectile absorbing Flak Shield, Heal Beam, automated Battle Sentry, or the ammo replenishing Ultra-Power Core. When you get a kill in Escalation, you earn money, which you can use to purchase weapons, activate traps, and open doors to access new sections of the map. The enemies come out in droves, so sticking with your team and devising and effective battle strategy is the only way to survive.Transformers: Fall of Cybertron is a solid action experience with a few issues that hold it back from greatness. The story campaign entertains and the multiplayer modes entice you to come back after the credits roll, but the out-of-place melee segments, polish issues, and dropped features from the first game make it fall short. If you’re a Transformers super fan looking for more giant robot action or just looking for a fun shooter experience, Transformers: Fall of Cybertron will not disappoint."

The multiplayer is littered with hackers and cheaters, and two out of the four classes should be nerfed. The scientist is one of those classes. The little fiend can fly out of the borders and camp to get a few kills without having to worry about getting killed. The worst part is that the scientist is good for long to mid rnage encounters, and even close range at times, making extremely unfair for players using classes like the titan, who has no long range capability. it even has an ability to drop a sentry so it can fly out of battle and still damage the player. And now let's talk about the meme demon himself, the destroyer class. It's the class with the only weapon that can kill in one shot, including titans. Yes, I'm aware that it takes skill to pull it off, but even if you don't kill your enemy in one shot with the rift combustor, you'll still get them to a low amount of health due to the fact that it release smaller bombs upon detonation, which do tons of damage. In my opinion, this isn't a game that's balanced. It's not like any of the other shooter games where if something is wrong, a patch will fix it. The game's flawed beyond repair, and the devolopers don't seem to give a damn about this game."

It's the better game between the two, honestly. But it's short. Even shorter than the first one. And while there's a multiplayer component in it (please note: unlike the first one there's no co-op in this one, though), €50 is a hefty price to pay for such a short experience. I'll admit; there's more variation in the missions this time and the graphics are more colorful and diverse (it looks stunning in motion), it still all comes down to shooting down other robots, and occasionally transforming. It truly is a shame, because the missions where you have to use stealth and grapple around the environments are pretty cool. I wish every mission had a different gameplay element, because there's just so many Transformers. Back in the day when the TV show was still on the air I knew most of these characters. Now I have a hard time distinguishing them.If you're a fan, grab it. Otherwise, just wait.[Rating: 77/100]"

You get to play as a variety of characters from both autobots and decepticons each with unique abilities to spice up gameplay (an aspect war for cybertron suffered from a lack of), one level you'll be running around as Optimus gunning down cons while Metroplex decimates enemies in the background and another mission you'll be assaulting an autobot base as Bruticus literally crushing enemies. Speaking of which one of FOC's strongest aspects is the feeling of scale and size. In missions where you play as Optimus or Jazz you fight the same enemies of equal size to you, when you play as Bruticus or Grimlock you're still fight the same enemies but they're smaller making you think ""oh wow Grimlock is BIG"".Another thing FOC gets right is the culmination of 95% of the games mechanics into the final level creating an epic final act. On top of that the final level itself is by far one of the best end levels I've played through in a while, it looks and feels like total anarchy.Fall of Cybertron is by far the best transformers game released and feels like the developers knew and cared for the characters and their world. It's a total shame the series was destroyed by activision with their terrible movie cross over as this series was only getting better."

In a way, it did some things I wasn't too terribly thrilled about, but did others that kind of made up for it. WfC had a neat campaign, in which you got to play as the Decepticons and the Autobots and see each side of the respective storylines. FoC, on the other hand, mixes it up and does it more in a sort of episodic formula. On one hand, this is a pretty neat approach to the game, and it allows you to try out the various mechanics the games offers. However, I can't help but think it's an overglorified tutorial for what is apparently supposed to the main part of this game, the multiplayer. And while I enjoy multiplayer games every once in a while, this isn't really the sort of game I'd play an online portion for.The big hook of this game, for me, was the dinobots. Especially Grimlock, since they advertised him in many of the trailers. The problem, of course, is that you get to play him, but only for one mission. And it's near the end of the game. However, playing as Grimlock is just insanely and wonderfully satisfying. You're playing a big badass transforming-robot-TRex and the game just makes you feel like almsot nothing can seriously harm you. And best of all, he's one of the good guys. Unfortunately, if you want to play as him online, you have to buy a separate pack that contains all four of the dinobots. Or rather, 4 playable dinobots.Overall, the changes made to Fall of Cybertron don't necessarily hinder it, but if you're someone looking for a decent single player experience, I would recommend sticking with the predecessor. However, if you can bare it for about 11 chapters, you'll be rewarded with one of the most satisfying experiences I've played in a while."

It does have its downsides, mainly small performance issues but overall an amazing game. I've played the first installment and the third installment (Which by the way is an abomination to the most extreme caliper and I will confront anyone who thinks other wise). The best part of this games is its homage and strong referances to the original G1 series from the 1980's cartoon but yet still strongly implemants modern designs and ideas. The first game and this one are loosely based off of the novel ""Transformers Exodus"", which by the way gets more in depth about Optimus Prime and Megatron's relationship and why the war started in the first place. It's a great read, I would reccomend it to any die hard fans or anyone who looks to delve into more about Transformers before the war. Peter Cullen reprises his role as Optimus Prime, that's a plus and this game has the Dinobots. Specifically Grimlock, my favorite TF. I've played this game since it first came out and I've been playing it since (Albeit on PS3, then PS4, then here on PC).  It's different that it concentrates more on the Transformers before their arrival to Earth. You're not going to find a better TF game then this. Multiplayer is pretty solid, Escalation in my opinion is not as good as the first games but still good to play with friends and the story is one of my favorites amongst the TF lore. It's definitely not worth $50 and it did come out almost 5 years ago but when its on sale, I strongly advise grabbing this and preparing yourself for fire breathing t-rex, city transforming, giant robot badassery."

Multiplayer (TDM, Capture the Flag, and Domination), Escalation, and Singleplayer. The Singleplayer portion is enjoyable and is able to keep the player interested in the game throughout its duration. There are four classes in multiplayer and each have their own weapons and armour pieces. Is this game worth $50? No. It came out 4 and half year ago. Come on Activision! I do think the game is worth a solid $20 bucks. And I do recomend to get the tittle when it is one sale. In the end the game hold up well, but is not worth the full price. I give this game an 8/10. Definitly one of the if not the best Transformers game out there!"

The gameplay is streamlined for the one and only character you can use for each mission and it has a much more dramatic and cinematic feel than WfC.  The Teletraan store is a great addition to the gameplay as it lets you purchase items and upgrades as you can afford them in-mission and I like that High Moon makes you search for some of the blueprints instead of just making them mission-completion rewards.  This is related to the added bonus of eliminating the ""energon"" abilities from the first game that I didn't like too much anyway.  Also, GRIMLOCK SMASH.Seriously, Grimlock is hands-down the best part of the game.  After getting my aft handed to me time after time by cocky little spawns o' glitches every level, suddenly being a bullet sponge with a giant sword and nothing but ""kill, kill, kill"" as my mission objective was like getting a shot of epinephrine heavily laced with catharsis.I have only two complaints about the campaign:One, Cliffjumper's mission needed a tad more polish in the way of directing you.  It's the only mandatory stealth section in the entire game and we're given no explanation of how enemies detect your presence.  Additionally, the instructions were vague on the explanation for stealth takedowns and failed to given any indication that you could kill EVERY ENEMY YOU ENCOUNTER with a one-hit-stealth-kill if you stay out of sight.  I almost gave up on the game because I couldn't figure out how to get past the legion of enemies between me and the next room without alerting them all.Two, the upgrades negate a lot of the difficulty after you've purchased enough of them.  The game is still difficult, mind you, but unlocking the fusion cannon and decking it out to full power basically made me a demigod amongst NPCs for the rest of the game on ""Medium"" difficulty.  All fell before my unstoppable onslaught of overpowered death spheres.All this being said, I still love this game and recommend that everyone try it.Right now.Play the game.

So my major gripe with the previous game was that the gameplay felt very bland and several of the characters outside of Optimus and Megatron felt like reskinned versions of each other. This game? Complete opposite. The combat feels quite satisfying as you are given a much wider range of weapons, and more importantly, each playable character has their own stage and they all feel unique with different abilities (with a couple exceptions such as the grappling and stealth stages). For example, Cliffjumper's level is a stealth mission, whereas Grimlock's (HIGHLIGHT of the whole game for me) is just about annihilating EVERYTHING in sight (Did I mention he has a DINOSAUR mode?).The game both retains and improves upon the aesthetic of the original, and even feels pretty grim at times given the stage of the war (Both sides have, for all intents and purposes, lost at this point as Cybertron can no longer support them). The character and voice acting is fantastic, with a few exceptions though (Steve Blum is NOT good as Shockwave). They got as many of the orignal voice actors as they could for this (anyone who they could reach or wasn't dead). In my opinion, a MUST HAVE for any die hard transformers fan and probably the best game of the franchise ever made."

The game has a great storyline, awesome multiplayer and very good art direction. That being said, there is something terribly wrong with this game.First and foremost, this game seems to be all about the money, not about community and/or support of said community. Fall of Cybertron is a typical release from one of the biggest companies in gaming history. As such the price for the core game is kept artificially high (even during sales) and the DLC is overpriced and lacklustre.The development team was taken off the game about a month or two after release so patching bugs or changing detrimental flaws is just not going to happen.The game is a straight up console port with no PC love given whatsoever. The only reason it isn't dead yet is its community. People that want to play Transformers and are willing to put up with the non-existant support and consequentially the rampant and blatant cheaters that plague the multiplayer landscape.It's sad that a game and a franchise that has such devout following gets so little love from its own creators. Personally I hope that one day a company that cares about the franchise (beyond seeing it as a big golden cash-cow) can have a go at making a great Transformers game. One that has some lasting vision, and some heart. For now, fans of the franchise are stuck with this: an awesome game that could have been so much more were it not for corporate greed and the ever present God-money.Can I recommend this game? Yes. But only if you, like me, are a devout follower of the franchise. At full price, even a year after release, with the dwindeling player numbers and the non-existant support, it is just not going to be worth it for the average gamer. It is a real shame that something so awesome can leave such a bad taste in your mouth."

Thankfully they listened to the criticism, and the game is now definetly longer than the first one, while maintaining the amazing story. Sadly however, it is now less lucrative to swap between forms than it was in the first game. That said, all transitions between forms, weapons etc. are now even more mint than they were in the first game, making this game visually stunning on a whole new level. Combining the story, with the visual masterpiece along with an entirely new upgrading system for weapons and perks, makes this game worth a playthrough, sadly however I believe that the price should rather be seated around €25, rather than €49.99."

In some of the settings/environments, there were deeper stories which were glossed over and finer details ignored. I would have liked to spend time with some of the characters more....but they just got one level, and then you moved onto another TF. It played kind of like a quick survey course in Transformers. Lost in the immediacy and the hectic action thriller pace of the plot were the deeper questions of where Metroplex came from, why was the planet Cybertron was dying, and what Megatron was really after?Those things are never clear though...and thus the motivations of the plot itself are not so clear. It seems like the set pieces are there to tell a deeper tale....but the game had to be rushed to market, and lot was glossed over.All you know from the getgo is that this is the time when the Autobots and Decepticons take their leave from Cybertron, and will (ostensibly) end up on Earth.I'm one of those fans that has always felt that the best Transformer stories were the ones that took place on Cybertron....where you got a little bit of Cybertronian cultural history to go with your usual plot McGuffin Device. This game had a similar opportunity, and did a good job with it, but it would have been much nicer if the treatment just had a bit more depth. How about a subplot with Vector Sigma, or some information about Primus and or Unicron?On Earth...things kind of get meh and stale.

It was a challenge to a point, but this game was not designed for what they used as the final fight. Reminds me too much of the first God of War's final fight. Strip most of the combat mechanics and stuff you into a too small arena. All the while taunting you with a ""change the difficulty screen."" I Do NOT want to change the difficulty. What I want is for you to not change the game mechanics at the last second for the sake of a ""more difficult"" final fight. After an hour of hearing the same dialoge I gave up.

You won't take cover, and you won't regenerate health (although you do have a regenerating shield). You'll move really, really goddamn fast, and shoot ridiculous weapons at other Transformers to make them explode. Jumping around, dashing back and forth, while launching everything from rockets, streams of lightning, grenades, electrified harpoons, and the always reliable bullet into the faceplate of  whatever stands, floats, drives, flys, or so forth between you and your goal is immensely satisfying.If this game looks interesting to you, I would go for it.

The campaign is more interesting introducing and controlling familiar characters that are a mix of the movie and G1 versions. The campaign also kept things interesting as one mission is stealth oriented while another is focused on running through a lab looking for lost team mates. The story also bounces between Autobot and Decepticon or different characters, unlike the previous games here's one side, now here's the other. It greatly adds to the story and makes it less rigid.I briefly played the multiplayer which feels like a lesser version of COD style level progression unlocking weapons and add-ons but the reward to level ratio is skewed.

War for Crybertron wasn't a bad game, but it did feel like it was missing some sort of umph. FoC has so much more soul, the controls are tighter, the transformations feel smoother, and so much more. While the co-op option was removed, they used that extra time and energy to make the single player campaign so much better.Much of the game is a prequel to events in the original series, and some of it will not be canon. However, the play on some events does not detract from the game at all. The constant homages to the Generation 1 series of cartoons as well as the movie add so much life to the game.Overall, the game was constantly action packed, the Transformers you play are different enough to keep the play styler varied, the weapons were good, and the levels had a much better design this time around.

One (bad point) is that they take the simple combat system that the original had and add some pseudo-roleplay aspects such as adding an in-game store where you can buy perks and upgrades and items for the game.  Not to mention they distribute all these containers all around the battle field that you open for 250 of the currency and its a roulette as to what to get.The story picks up after the events for War for Cybertron and does a good job at giving explanation to how the transformers struggle to leave Cybertron. Good thing is Dark Energon is more or less thrown out as a plot device and barely mentioned.The Autobots and Decepticon storylines are a little more fleshed out and we get to see several familiar faces (being Grimlock and the Dinobots to name a few) and names being added to it.The problem is that not only do we see that we also see a little fan service in the game as well that pushes the story into independent of the cartoons for generation 1 and that's something I was not really happy to see. The story also does the standard recounting of events that got us to the start of the game then at the end continuing on from there till the climax.One thing I liked was the more fleshed out independent stories of the characters in the game it was fun seeing from their perspectives as you played you do get the feel for how they do things. And obviously as a transformers game explosions are abound in the area so you get a sense of the war being brutal to a point.Overall I would say this game is worth getting when its on sale but not when its not its a nice fun short game,(This game is easier to control with a keyboard and mouse then with a gamepad oddly enough.. if you do aim to use one remapping the keys is recommended)"

I'm not a huge fan, but I like Transformers, a lot.I won't spoil or try not to spoil parts of the game with my personal review of Transformers: Fall for Cybertron or TFC for short. I played the game on Normal difficulty and finished it in around 10 hours maybe less.Story-I won't say much about the story here, its best for you to experience it yourself, but its nothing to write home about. You will understand exactly what needs to be done and whats going on. There are references to other Transformer things which was done very well.Graphics-The graphics are well thought out and the overall design of things is amazing. A mix of metal and organic terrain made for great level design in terms of where you went and how you moved. I can't say the same for graphics.... The graphics are poor when up close and worse when you're in a cutscene. The teaser videos for the game looked so awesome, but thats where the ""shiny-ness"" ends. Your character looks great and so do other bots. I enjoy the little things that shift and move on your character. Transformations are also fun to watch. I liked Vortex and Jazz for their transformations.UI-I hated the UI for TFC. You had to really pay attention in order to find certain things. It was made worse for the PC port. Scrolling tickers to describe things, saves space but also makes it extremely annoying to read. BUT it doesnt matter when most of the screen is empty space! Navigation is a joke on PC. I'm sure it would have been tolerable for console but not by much. Repeatedly having to press the cycle page button to go to each tab was a pain in the neck. Why not click on the tab that we wanted to be in? Again, this is a PC port and its terrible. Even the keybinds were locked to 4-5 different combinations of options to choose from, I was blown away.PC is unable to change each key manually, which hurt this game for PC by a lot. What could I do? I had to bare it.Transformation-I'll speak of tranformation in a seperate place because I played the PC port of the game. Yes, I know the game was not designed for PC and it was later implemented to be played on PC. I'm not sure how being in vehicle mode differs from PC to console, but in the PC, the sensitivity is reduced drastically where its extremely slow to manuver you vehicle around. Driving like a car was a mess and its either a slight angle towards some random direction or a 90 degree angle swerve in the direction you want to go. Flight mode was fine going in one direction but if you needed to turn around, it was about 3-4 swipes of my mouse to make a 180 turn. I had to get used to this problem in order to play certain sections which forced you to play in vehicle mode.It was fine in robot mode, but vehicle was a different story. I enjoyed myself the most in Vortex's stage. I loved Vortex as a playable character, robot mode, then helicopter then jet when boosting in air, rapid fire guns that sped up as you held it down longer and extremely satisfying explosive rounds you can fire.Transformations were either forced events or never used. In robot mode, you can shoot, run, dash, dodge, and jump. In car mode you just went straight or hovered slowly firing your weak guns. The levels were designed in a way where it was most useful to play in robot mode and others in car mode. They were very obvious about it. It wasn't much of a choice if you wanted to play in a particular mode. I had the most fun in Vortex's and Starscreams stage because they balanced the stage in a way where you had to fly to your location to fight on either land or air. If you got cornered you can fly away for a better angle or if you had some skills you can dodge on land and out-manuver your enemy.Gameplay-Going through different sections to fight the enemy was a blast. Literally. Everywhere you go, there is an explosion happening. I don't mind it too much. Specially for one or two sections of the game where its quiet for a reason. As I mentioned in Transformations, the level design was based on what form you had to be.You had a good variety of enemies to fight. You had flying guys, snipers that fly to different locations, rocket launcher guys that stayed in the back, but were useless, regular gun guys that hid behind cover and moved around from cover to cover, heavy guys that had shotguns which rushed your position and would teabag you if it was part of the game( most dangerous enemy IMO). Bugs that swarm you, and a few more. Each posed a threat in their own way, but nontheless weak.Boss fights? Well, we have a few, but ALL invovle, ""hit this"" or ""break this"" to hurt the boss. You never actually fight the main boss mano y mano but rather something else that hurts the boss. This makes boss fights extremely simple to programs and fight.There is a large variety of guns to choose from. You find blueprints to unlock new guns to buy at a Teleraan 1 machine scattered at obvious points, almost abundant. There you can buy guns, equip different ones if you don't like the one you're carrying, upgrade guns and perks, and buy consumables. The only reason I use this, is to get a different gun to suit my playstyle. The only upgrades I got were the perks for increased health, health and ammo supply everytime you access a Teleraan 1, shield cooldown. You can only carry one main gun and one heavy gun. Heavy guns most have special abilities attached to them. Your main guns are your basic fair, with some other interesting ones. Most guns have upgrades, which are generic and un-impactful.You can also carry two sub wepaons that are consumed on use. The only one I found that was useful was the shield, which you can shoot through.Perks are some generic upgrades that make your character stronger in same way. If they removed the upgrades system all together, the game would have played the same.OH! Did I forget to explain to you that there is currency in the game? Well, neither did the game.... It was pertinent to show use how to jump, dash, shoot, and transform, but not tell us that money was needed to buy things. They also don't tell you that certain things break and contain money called Shards. I walked by something like a box or crate and thought it was useful later on because it had a blue outline. I later found out that all those boxes I passed were Shard containers!Each chapter had a different Transformer to play as, and that changed things up a bit for playstyles. It's a welcome sight to change the repeatative nature of go to location and shoot stuff, when you can change how you get there makes it a different experience.For example, you either would use your biped's, fly, sneak, drive, or stomp your way to different locations based on the character and chapter you played. This also enabled you to play both sides of the fight. Playing Autobot or Decepticon. Each playing a different role in the fight for what the fate of all bots are going to be. Of course those familiar with the story will know exactly what it is. This created different things for the bots to do in order to survive. Each had some sort of impact in the story. (don't be confused with player choice, there is none here.) Very linear.Price-I would say that the price tag is asking way too much, even for a fan. $60 for an average of 10 hours of gameplay? No, thanks. I waited it out till the game went on sale for 75% off. That took about 2 years to happen! Even then I felt robbed of my $20. The value you get for this game is worth $15-$20 at most. I didn't even attempt multiplayer because I knew that it was filled with hackers and bots, and it would have been like standing on Cybertron when all life has ceased to exist.Like many have also said, This game is the best Transformers game to date. They aren't lying, but its still a mediocre game. 7 out of 10 at $20 for me."

Although I never watched the original G1 Cartoons or Beast Wars, I did watch Armada and some of Energon, as well as the Bayformers trilogy. Back in 2008 I bought Transformers: War for Cybertron and I loved it. I never got to buying Fall of Cybertron until now when the Activison Steam Sale came up and I was not dissapointed.The story for Fall of Cybertron in my opinion is much better compared to War for Cybertron's. The humor is still there and the characters have their own sense of personality, which I like. Unlike War for Cybertron, there aren't two other characters supporting you through the mission, which also means that the co-op campaign from the first game is not present aswell. However, you have an ingame store in which you can buy and upgrade weapons. items and perks using Energon. The gameplay is overall similar to the first game and it felt natural to me. Besides the story, I have yet to try the multiplayer, or Escalation, which was one of my favorite parts of War for Cybertron.Overall, Fall of Cybertron is much better than it's predecessor and I enjoyed it very much. The only negative thing I can think of besides no co-op campaign is that the game is still priced $59.99. If you wait for a Steam Sale however, this should not be a problem.9/10."

This game without that, with the story, the action, and all the different characters is still incredible! There is a great deal of weapons and upgrades, so you can stick with making one gun really powerful or just generally enhance all of them. The fact you can swap your weapon hand in this game, as apposed to the last lends itself to the really fun gunplay in which you either have to take cover or keep moving and dodging. Most the cover is destructible in some way by the way. The transforming into a vehicle has great animation and it just feels fantastic every time I do it in game whether in combat or to move around. Also, I should mention each character feels unique in their own way, and you can sense the love that went into this game, it even has a few fanservice moments if you watched the old show. I'm currently playing it my second time with keyboard and still feels pretty good. Overall, this is one mind-blowing game with some major ""HELL YEAH!"" moments.

76561198010567652,Recommended,213120,10748368,"Posted: 24 June, 2014",all,T-Buster,"Building upon the foundation of the previous game, Fall of Cybertron offers a more streamlined single-player experience. The campaign features a variety of well-known characters from the Transformers franchise, with an emphasis on G1 characters and personalities. Although you cannot choose your character (each chapter has one specific character you play) and there is no co-op, each chapter is tailored to suit the character you are playing; Optimus Prime can call in artillery strikes, and so has levels with large battlefields. Cliffjumper can cloak, so his level supports a stealthy approach, and so on. Despite being a planet made entirely of metal, Cybetron contrives to have several varied environments, which helps to make the game feel less same-y.Combat is primarily of a third-person-shooter format; the player can carry one primary weapon and one Heavy weapon at a time, and is further armed with their vehicle mode's weapon. Players can transform at any time and the different vehicle modes each have varying levels of mobility and firepower. An unexpected (but highly useful) feature is the ability to change which hand your character shoots from, and thusly which shoulder the camera hovers over. This is much better than the previous game (and many other third-person shooters), where you would be forced to rely on taking cover on the left side of a battlefield.Although the game's campaign in itself is a marvel, its multiplayer is also highly enjoyable; players have access to four character ""classes""; Infiltrator (Car), Destroyer (Truck), Titan (Tank) and Scientist (Jet). Each class has a choice of two special abilities and four weapons, each with three optional perk upgrades. Furthermore, there is a wealth of cosmetic customisation, with each character skin in the game available to players to mix and match parts, which are purchased through in-game currency. Because it is not possible to purchase weapons or perks in this way, there is no ""pay to win"" aspect at all. This includes the DLC, which only unlocks more character skins.However, the multiplayer has some problems; there is no in-game chat or voice chat, there are no dedicated servers (which can result in frequent Host Migration issues, although thankfully not as bad as at launch) and the game is open to exploitation by hackers. Thankfully, in my recent multiplayer matches, encounters with hackers have been rare, but they do still happen. Finally, the game's playerbase is very small, and the only mutliplayer mode that sees frequent use is Team Deathmatch.The third game mode is Escalation, where a team of four players fight increasingly dangerous waves of enemies. Each map has a specific set of four characters with specific abilities. I would have liked the option to bring your customised multiplayer character into Escalation (much like WH40K: Space Marine's Exterminatus mode), but it is a minor complaint.In terms of graphics and sound design, this game is beautiful if you can appreciate its heavy sci-fi aesthetic. Peter Cullen reprises his role as Optimus Prime, along with the other voice actors from War for Cybertron. Greg Berger also returns as Grimlock, albeit not using exactly the same voice and mannerisms.All-in-all, if you are a Transformers fan then you should definitely buy this game. If you are not a fan, but still want a decent third-person-shooter experience, then I would still recommend it. It is sadly still priced at £30, but is occasionally put on sale. I would advise picking it up at half-price or less if at all possible, but struggle to recommend a full-price purchase.TL:DR Version;Pros:-Transforming robots.-Explosions.-Guns.-Fancy graphics.-Nice multiplayer customisation(Decepti)Cons:-Small playerbase.-Occasional cheaters/hackers in multiplayer-Bit expensive at full priceTransform and roll out!"

,Recommended,213120,10854984,"Posted: 26 June, 2014",all,ImmortalEmperor,"Fall of Cybertron picks up where War for Cybertron left off: Optimus Prime has commissioned an Ark to leave Cybertron behind to the Decepticons, a plan that some of his fellow 'bots question. Meanwhile, the Decepticons continue their conquest of the planet, and are hellbent on not allowing the Autobots to take the pacifistic route out of their conflict.If you played War for Cybertron, you know what to expect from the singleplayer campaign: a solid Transformers story told during the early stages of the war, as viewed from both Autobot and Decepticon perspectives. Unlike War for Cybertron, in Fall you do not pick which faction's story you want to play through: instead, the story jumps from character-to-character, Autobot to Decepticon, depending on the narrative. This was neither a pro nor a con: the story is still tight, and although the 'choice' was removed, you likely ended up playing both factions' storylines in WfC anyway.The different bots in FoC all have unique abilities beyond just their alt modes: Jazz, for example, has a grappling hook that allows him to traverse vertically throughout his level. Playing as Cliffjumper switches up the usual run-and-gun in this game for more stealth-oriented gameplay, sneaking up on enemies and dispatching them with quick executions. But the coolest ability is as you play through the Combaticons' story parts, eventually merging into the rampaging Bruticus. Playing as a combiner is awesome.Once you've completed the singleplayer mode, you'll want to jump into the multiplayer. Here's where the game really shines--but also exposes some of its biggest flaws. The actual meat of the multiplayer is great: customizing your bots is hands down the coolest thing in this game, creating your own builds, color schemes, unlocking new parts, and ranking up to gain new weaponry and abilities will consume your time. The gameplay is frenetic, and shooting other Transformers never gets old. There are a lot of ""Hell yeah!"" moments to be had while playing this game.That being said, multiplayer has some serious issues. First off, there is no chat. Let me say that again. THERE IS NO CHAT. None. Nada. Not at all. Not in-game, not in the multiplayer lobby, nowhere and no-how. If you want to communicate with your fellow 'bots or 'cons, you better master the art of interpretive jumping and shooting to indicate what you want to tell them, because that's all you get. Somehow, in a game with such good core multiplayer, they forgot to add in a feature that's been a staple of online games since MUDs. As Kup would say, ""Of all the circuit-glitched, diode-blowing dimwittery, YOU LEFT A PIECE OUT!""So maybe you don't care about talking to your teammates or enemies, you just want to blast other people. Well, you can...but you might have to wait a short while, depending on when you log in, as player population in this game fluctuates. Multiplayer definitely isn't dead--I've jumped on at all hours, and I never really have to wait longer than a few minutes to get into a match. But you might want to set your matchmaker settings to ""Worldwide"" just to be sure.And because this game uses peer-to-peer multiplayer, expect getting iffy connections--although I've never found them to be too bad--and in the case of people quitting out of the match early, the dreaded ""Host Migration"" warning. If the person hosting the game leaves, expect an agony worse than Galvatron faced when Unicron was torturing him. You will sit there with that message blinking red on your screen for an ungodly amount of time, and 9 times out of 10 it will make you wait just to boot you back to the multiplayer menu.Cheating is also an issue you might come across in this game. Now, some people might exaggerate how rampant it is, but honestly I barely ever see anyone blatantly cheating. You may, once in one hundred games, see that one player with the illegible name spamming infinite rockets out of his gun at velocities reserved for Macross and not Transformers, but screw that person and just switch to a different game. With any luck, you might've been the host, and just subjected him to the horrors of Host Migration.If you can get past those flaws, multiplayer is really rewarding. There are a lot of 3rd person shooters out there, but there are no other 3rd person shooters that allow you to play as a jet, soaring over your enemies--who are cars, btw--while pelting them with missiles, only to have them transform into giant robots who are now blasting back at you with shotguns. And that's when you also transform into a giant robot, deploy an aerial sentry gun overhead to rain down machinegun death, while dropping on top of your enemies and converting your arm into an energy sword to hack them to pieces.And while it's a shame the game hasn't had a permanent price drop, it's worth the price of admission if you're a huge Transformers fan--or even if you're just a fan of shooters with good plots and fun gameplay."

The whole thing is a love letter to guys who grew up with the franchise and you can tell that the team behind it really wanted to do the property justice. They delivered in a big way.Fall of Cybertron is a third-person shooter with surprisingly tight gameplay, a phenomenal campaign, good competitive multiplayer, and a co-op horde mode.The campaign is split down the middle. Half of the levels have you playing as the Autobots, through their side of the story. And the other is the Decepticons, playing through their side. Both parts of the campaign are brilliantly done and there's a lot to love if you're a Transformers nerd. Optimus Prime running through the trenches screaming needlessly about freedom brings a smile to my face every time. Over the course of the campaign, you'll play as many different characters with unique abilities, and each has their own feel. It's a great feature that makes every level feel different from the last. It's a great little campaign that never gets boring. This is the main attraction of the game, for sure.Throughout the levels are stations where you can select your loadout and upgrade your weapon with resources you gather as you kill enemies and play through the game. These upgrades go across both factions and all characters, and there's a lot of options. Weapon variety is great, and it's made even better because it ties into the upgrade system. Most upgrades are simple (upgrade a gun's accuracy, or its ammo capacity, etc.) but if you buy all the upgrades for a given weapon, you get a more unique and powerful upgrade that varies from weapon to weapon. These upgrades stay unlocked even when you replay the game, so it's functionally a constant new game+ mode where you can continue to play through and unlock upgrades. Great for replay value.The gameplay is absolutely perfect for what a Transformers game should be. At any time you can switch into vehicle mode to increase mobility or access a different set of weapons, and it's actually balanced very well. Sure you may already be a giant death robot, but if you transform into a giant death tank you have access to heavier, long range weapons, at the cost of speed. Or maybe transform into a fast car that has no real firepower to speak of, but insane speed. It's all very smooth and functions well. All depends on the character/class you're playing as.Multiplayer can be played in a cooperative horde mode/tower defense style, or traditional competitive play. There's not much to say about the horde mode. It's the same horde/tower defense mode we've seen dozens of times, and you collect resources to unlock new parts of the map, weapons, etc. like in Nazi Zombies. It's fun, but nothing to write home about.The competitive mode lets you fully customize your own Transformer (you can have presets from both factions) using bits from existing characters (as well as full control over the paint job), and it's a lot of fun. You're simply pitted against other players in traditional MP modes (deathmatch, domination, etc.). It's balanced and works well. No complaints whatsoever. It's a fun mode that is surprisingly well-balanced.One thing to note is that, strangely, the PC port does NOT have controller support in some menus. It does for most of the game, but some menus it's just absent with no explanation. For instance, the upgrade system I mentioned earlier? The upgrade menu requires you to use your mouse and keyboard, even if you've been playing the game with a controller. A minor inconvenience, but an inconvenience nonetheless.We'll probably never see another Transformers game like this, because the sequel was tied into the Michael Bay movie series because of corporate meddling, and passed off to another developer.Big time recommendation by the Transformers fanboy in me who grew up."

Where Michael Bay dropped the energon, High Moon Studios & Activision picked it up and ran to the f*ckin intergalactic in-zone with it... then did a pharaoh dance, whilest proceeding to take a big smelly diarrhea dump all over a pile of michael bay's transformer films on bluray, before setting it a blaze in a viking funeral!The story is fantastic and very emotional, the graphics hold up really well, the voice acting has a wonderfully familiar feeling, and presentation is spectacular (full of 'hollywood blockbuster' moments, which somehow don't drag down the gameplay or cheapen the experience like it often does in other games).This is a direct continuation of War of Cybertron, so playing that game before Fall of Cybertron (back-to-back) if you can, is suggested to get the full effect.I've played this twice on console from the beginning to end, and just decided to give the pc version another go. I was locked in, on the edge of my seat the whole time: its a riveting game. Mercenary Technology also did a very good job with porting this to PC, and it is definitely better looking than the recent PS4/XBO ports and runs well on even weaker pcs.The only thing that could have made this game even better was if it had it been Gen 1 Transformers - but thats a small complaint now that we have a good Gen 1 Transformers action game from Platinum Games.Not sure which is better, this or Transformers Devastation. However one thing is for sure: this is to the modern transformers films, what Ghostbusters (3): The Videogame is to the Ghostbusters series.Buy it - Buy it - Buy it.

It's very much a love letter to all the children of the 80s that grew up with this franchise, with tons of references, bits of familiar dialogue and cameos that will have longtime fans (like myself) grinning from ear to ear.

Thank You activision except for the shutting down of multiplayer which I won't even play at all as I'm here for the storyline and awesome robot fights.I would rate it 7.5-8/10, my current favourite transformers game even though it's 4 years old."

Especially if you enjoyed its predecessor War for Cybertron, I would definetly encourage getting and playing this one too.Two points tho;First is a drastic improvement on the combat mechanics making it a very enjoyable way to play the game - especially in its latter chapters. Some aspects remain annoying, but I think it still mixes it enough to be worth it all.Second is a somewhat regretful grinding and upgrading mechanic used to improve the weapons and tools availible. I can see some merit in it, but to me it mainly distracts from what could be a very enthralling gameplay. A mixed bag, but not too bad to warrent much negative to be said about it outside it wanting to push grinding for the sake of it."

The world is very detailed and feels... I can't really describe it in a word but... again how old games managed to pull off immersion by putting you in the set pieces, making the world feel alive by doing more than just ploping a column of smoke and sounds of gunfire off in the distance.Health doesn't just magically regenerate and you'll die relatively fast if you're stupid. The weapons feel pretty good and overall the gameplay is simply good and the campaign is pretty well paced.However multiplayer seems to be all but alive, its pretty much impossible to find a match later in the evening but you can manage to find a few in the late morning or afternoon. Also, all of the DLC seems to apply to multiplayer and its mostly just a bunch of cosmetics. Buy it at your own risk as multiplayer seems like it could die off any day at this rate but it is enjoyable.Between the reviews I've seen and my limited experience I'd say its worth grabbing on sale but definitely not for the ridiculous standard release price. The only real negative about this game really is that not many people play it, though overall in itself it is a good game."

Fall of Cybertron returns with more of the relentless action, faithful characterisations and mind-blowing locations that made the first so popular.Unlike the first game, which contained 2 separate campaigns for Autobots and Decepticons, Fall of Cybertron switches you between both sides as you progress along the same storyline. Combat is intense and surprisingly challenging, and the addition of partially-destructable environments adds a tactical element to the fight. The voice-over work is great, with everything from the central characters to the incidental dialogue remaining faithful to the nature of each faction. The graphics are quite good, with a few trademarks of the Unreal engine unmistakably apparent - sometimes a positive, sometimes a negative. Glitches aren't frequent, thankfully, but the two or three I noticed required a re-load to get around. 8/10 - worth the 50 bucks."

76561198050910654,Recommended,213120,17484632,"Posted: 11 August, 2015",all,BigBadBat,"Transformers Fall of Cybertron is the sequel to War for Cybertron, published by Activision and developed by High Moon Studios.Like its predecessor FoC is a Sci Fi, action adventure, third person shooter.The story takes place somewhere around 4000 years ago on the home world of the transformers, Cybertron, during the final days of the war for Cybertron, with the heroic Autobots on the verge of defeat, making their last stand in the ruins of their former capital city of Iacon, defending their last hope of leaving their dead world from Megatron's relentless army of Decepticons, the Ark. From here the story takes a few very interesting turns that I'd rather not spoil, the campaign of this game is something that must be played.Graphics wise Fall of Cybertron does a great job at making every texture look amazing, every bit of technological detail is beautifully rendered, and, even if the whole damn planet is made out of metal there is a lot of color variation. Fall of Cybertron uses Unreal Engine 3, tho it is an old engine it is tried and tested. The only weakness in the graphics department are the cut scenes, some look great others are mediocre at best, I don't know why they decided to use a different engine then unreal engine 3 for the cut scenesThe soundtrack suits the atmosphere of the game, action packed, epic and somber.The sound effects are great, each gun feels powerfull, each step that you take you hear a thud suited to the size of the character you play as, the sound of crunching metal while punching another transformer is soooo good.The voice acting is top-notch, bringing in Peter Cullen as the iconic voice of Optimus Prime along with the golden boys of the voice acting industry Nolan North and Troy Baker.The controls are nothing special, they are your standard shooter controls, but when compared to War for Cybertron, Fall of Cybertron brings a lot of improvements, like allowing the player to switch the firing hand, sprint and dash in any direction, the vehicle controls are more or less the same the only thing that has changed is the feel, the ground no longer feels like ice when you drive.The multiplayer is quite challenging, it is class based, starting from the small and fast Infiltrator, going to the explosion loving Destroyer, leading to the brute class that is the Titan and ending with the flying medic, the Scientist, all of the skills that the player(you) has learned during single player will be put to the test, as you fight against other players in Fall of Cybertron's multiplayer. The level progression is nothing special, the more you level up the more items you will unlock, more or less like any other games that have multiplayer, such as CoD or BF. The match making system is just like the one in Call of Duty. The character customization allows you to mix around parts from different transformers and adding the colors that you like.Escalation is the other half of the multiplayer package, putting a team of 4 players against waves of relentless AI enemies, with each wave that passes the enemies begin to do more damage and become more and more difficult to kill, granted there are only 15 waves, play together as a well oiled machine and you and your friends might survive or get cocky, run around and die, have fun.Transformers Fall of Cybertron is one of the best games of 2012, amazing story, great multiplayer experience, overall a great game, I recommend this game to all transformers fans or to people that are interested in a Sci Fi shooter with an amazing story."

Both of these gameplay styles are included in the third person shooter. The multiplayer is great, not as good as the last game, but still can give you hours upon hours of enjoyment! The escalation mode however is not very good, the limited amount of waves and poor map design makes this gamemode unappealing.

I played the first in the series ""Transformers: War For Cybertron"" back when it came out and I loved it. When the squeal was announced I knew it was a must buy for me. Sadly, troubles came up and I ended up not being able to afford it at launch and  ended up forgetting about. Que four years later a nifty little transformers sale on steam. I bought this as soon as I saw it!StoryThe story is just as good as the first game's. Rich with your lovable robots and written well. It contniues right off the tail of WFC and does so with a bang. I wont say much about it, dont want to spoil it for anyone, but If you buy this solely for the campaign you will not be let down. You switch back and forth from the Autobots and the Decepticons in this well crafted movie-like expeirience. There is a draw back though. If you're wanting to run through this campaign with a friend like the first game, you will be a bit dissapointed. But do not let that discourage you!MultiplayerMuch like the first, Multiplayer seperated between your normal VS modes and Escalation. Want to tear up some other players? You'll feel right at home with Team Deathmatch, Capture The Flag, Headhunter, and conquest! More of a Co-Op PvE player? Then the round based ""Horde"" style Escalation is the mode for you. If you have a friend or two who you can play with it'll boost the fun of these modes ten-fold! Dont fret though theyre just as exciting solo queing. But I am sure youve heard that the multiplayer scene has died down and dwindled to the few. People still play but it is very sparse and hard to find a game. When you do though youll be in for some great times.GraphicsWhats a review without the obligitory graphics section? This game is goregous, simply put. Theres secnes where you will just stop and admire the land. Light rays enhance a scene even more by adding the perfect mood. Its fairly easy to run as well! I bought and played this on a low-end laptop with an integrated GPU and I can get 30FPS on the highest (Extra) setting. Im very sure if you have litterally any other computer youll get a buttery 60FPS no problem. I had only 3 or 4 dips in FPS while in the Campaign but other than that youll be fine running it on even a modern toaster (Damned 4 slot toasters.)SettingsIm a settings nut. I love tweaking every little detail and slider. If youre not thats fine this games graphics settings go as far  as ""Low, Medium, High, Extra"" with no other confusing jargon to get you woosey. For people like me, Sorry but nothing super amazing in the settings.AudioThis is by far my favorite part of this game (For some insight, Im a Professional producer and have worked in the relm of audio for years.) This game is load and boasts it. Not the distorted ""I like my $4 earbuds all the way up"" loud, But the smooth audiophile loud. The highs are crunchy and add character to just about everything, While the lows add the thump and punch to every shot and step you take. Fill it out with the mids that give you the heart of the sound and youve got some great design. When you transform you can really feel the grinding metal as it takes a new shape. Good job on that one High Moon!That's it! All and all (we're just another brick in the wall) you will be happy geting this game. The price currently (Not on sale) ranges at a steep $50 but if you have that money go ahead and show yourself some robot love. If not wait for the next sale and get to burnin' oil!~ END ~"

I'm ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥tting after some Jack Daniel's so stay with me for as long as you can.So I really liked WFC, it had an amazing campaign much better than the usual ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t games we get. Picking up from rthe last game, robots escaping a dead planet and scavagening any energon they can find. Optimus searching for refuge and Megatron being a general d-bag and not letting them leave. I thought this was a prequel to G1 or Prime but as I've heard it's a game that leads in to the terribly developed, Rise of the Dark Spark, which is a horrendous tie-in with the Bayverse movies. How did that happen? I have no idea.Campaign was good, the storyline wasnt really much for me to remember as the first game was but the change in enviroment was great. One thing I absolutely loved was Metroplex, how often do we get to see that guy? How they managed to work him into the storyline was awesome. I would have liked to see some more characters though. Yes, playing as Optimus and Megatron is the primary focus but the side characters are just as important.I did not like how there was no choice in character for mission nor was there any co-op campaign. There seemed to be more fun with two other characters and also how they can help (aside from their meager dps). Focusing on one character seems to make it not only a little more challenging but almost personal even though we did have side conversation all along. As for co-op I was really disappointed. I had a lot of fun in co-op back in WFC so to see I can't enjoy the campaign with a friend really cuts back on a lot.Now High Moon did ♥♥♥♥ up. Again.I will give them props for at least being respectful enough for giving us DLC but they failed to even patch the game. I played WFC and FOC on Xbox when both released and did not run into as many problems as I did on this platform. I have run into several instances where I was freefalling out the map, stuck in the floor, had to navigate around invisible walls, and other game breaking glitches. I had to reset my game numerous times or wait for 10 minutes just to continue playing. Not only that but some game interactions don't even work, like when Megatron is in Soundwave's lab.I will stress this again like I did in my WFC review, don't play multiplayer. Don't play in a public game. The multiplayer community is still around but there are players using infinite shield, FPS unlocker, rapidfire, and other unfair hacks to ruin the game. And just like in the last game, High Moon will do nothing about it. This game was dropped as soon as it was released much like it's last game which is still very disappointing.Recommended for campaign use only."

Multiplayer is extremely fun, and I may or may not have stayed up until 4am playing it. The freedom to transform wherever you want (also applies to singleplayer), and the ability to customize your own character are probably the two best factors. The game also has a great soundtrack.CONS: No chat system in multiplayer, which makes communicating with teammates very difficult/pretty much impossible.Summary: For £15, you can't turn it down. Highly recommended."

Because while the fast-paced-three dimensional shooting action is great, the single-player campaign is criminally short (heck I think it might even be shorter than ""War""), after you start to have fun with one bot or con you're immediately switched to a different one with different abilities.  Multiplayer does sooth the disappointment somewhat, but it doesn't have the same awesome moments like Jazz grappling between sniper points or Vortex swooping down to blindside some Autobots.  If there was an in-between ""meh"" option I would pick that, although at it's current $50, my thumb is weighed downwards. If you can find it on a big sale, then you should probably get it, it's a blast while it lasts."

Story continuation is good, and i love the addition of the dinobots and insecticons. Ending was a little weak 8/10.Review on Multiplayer:Multiplayer is dead for the most part. You might find a small group on whenever steam does a decent sale on this game, but past that, no one plays the multiplayer anymore.Review on DLC:DLC is mostly for multiplayer, and the weapons arent that great. You will find better weapons in the game. I wouldnt advice buying any of it unless its bundled for a decent price, and even then I still wouldnt recommend it as its just a waste of space.All in all, I would only recommend this game for people who only care about the campaign portion. I wouldnt pay full price for this game. Steam/Activision need to do a serious price drop on this game, as well as Rise of the Dark Spark, for the same reason due to the multiplayer in both games being dead, which makes the DLC useless."

At first the game felt like a step backward in that respect.  The beginning had a lot of scripting.  Once out of the initial phase the game play started taking off.  The last part is a marked departure from WfC, and the finale is intense.  They got the ending right.Most of the game's mechanics are the same as with War for Cybertron, with some important changes to others.  One criticism with both games is that you cannot remap keys.  It takes some getting used to.  They did a decent porting job on this, but that's a gripe on a PC version.I missed the Steam sale for War for Cybertron and picked up a boxed version so I can't do a direct recommend through Steam on that game, but it's definitely worth looking at as well.

So much for playing off of my steam link.So no only are the develpers SO lazy to NOT create a simple patch to fix this extreme annoyance, they have the gall to leave a nearly 5 year old game at a $50 base price ($70 if the total package) in the steam store.

This, and War for Cybertron, remains the best iteration in terms of story, of what happened to the Transformers race before and during the great war, and all of the major events which led to G1.Game mechanics are quite good as well, both robot and vehicle modes are usable in battle.Different characters offer different battle tactics and weaponry (in terms of vehicle mode) so it is not too boring.Transformation is satisfactory as well.

As a fan of the cartoons from back in the day, and a hater of the new films (they ruined every character design, and I mean EVERY) I expected this to be more new style than old.Yet somehow those who made this game managed to 'improve' the designs, yet keeping to each characters true design and stylings. This game is a prequel to what most people know (I've only 'watched' the first film so they may have told you more than I believe). So seeing the autobots in the homeworld states is kind of cool.As for the game itself I didn't expect such a fairly solid shooting mechanic, instead of sticking to a corner to and it peering around, you change your gun arm to give better viewing while remaining well covered. The weapons are varied and very cool. There are upgrades for both robot and vehicle form. And so far all the major names appear to be making appearences.I am not all that far, only in chapter four of thirteen. But so far there has been hold and fight sections, stealth sections (optional), side sections to search for the blueprints / logs if you want to do them.

It's probably better on a high-end machine that makes full use of the graphical engine, to render war-torn Cybertron in all its gleaming and awful majesty. Haven't tried multiplayer, but the single player is an interesting mix. It benefits from some run-and-gun or sniping skill, but also requires that you camp spawns and blind spots to take out foes before they can gang up on you.The story has some plot weaknesses (references to things that shouldn't have happened yet, abrupt appearance of problems and solutions), but is a pretty entertaining prequel and alternate origin story for the Transformers' adventures on Earth."

The co-op is gone, the levels are much more linear, and the Transformation gimmick is much less useful here.There is quite a variety of play styles beyond the standard over-the-shoulder shooter levels, such as stealth sections, rooftop sniping, flying through giant chasms, and giant-robot-dinosaur beat-em-ups, but they all only happen once or twice before being shoved away more more boring levels. There are many good ideas that only happen once and are never touched on again and they are unsatisfyingly short and easy due to their one-off nature. Grimlock himself is probably the biggest disappointment of all since you only play as him for one level at the very end.The multiplayer sucks as well since it has that dreadful Call of Duty time sink xp system. Basically, you start with a few guns, and as you spend more time playing, you unlock more, but it takes so damn long to unlock anything and you're at the mercy of players who have far more options than you because they have more weapon because you can't play this game for 8 hours a day. Also the Dinobots are DLC, which is a real slap in the face since they were practically the most hyped part of the game. Thankfully, you shouldn't have to worry about any of these problems because the online is dead and there's no local multiplayer or co-op.This game is only for hardcore transformers fans who like the brand more than they do fun, so if you're okay with a boring game with a nonsensical plot with ugly levels and lame multiplayer just because it says Transformers on it, then you already own this.

Here I am playing a videogame controling none other than Optimus Prime, and it's every bit as cool as I always dreamt it would be. I'm stomping around Cybertron, blasting Decepticons, turning into a truck and I feel in every way that the experince could not have made me 'feel' more like my childhood hero without implanting my conciousness into his robotic brain.Honestly if it sounds like I'm gushing, it's because I am. As a kid I discovered Transformers at about the perfect time and the franchise resonated with me in a big way.  As such, Transformers: Fall of Cybertron hit all the right notes and is exactly the sort of power fantasy my inner child has craved since Christmas of 1993, when a 5-year-old me unwrapped the coolest toy I would ever own, hands shaking from excitement: my very own Optimus Prime...Mechanically I found Fall of Cybertron was kept engaging throughout by an ever-changing roster of playable characters. Each level presents you with at least one new character from the Transformers universe, each  feeling unique with their own combat mechanics and transformation mode. This ever changing set of toys to play with keeps the game fresh and interesting throughout and is Fall of Cybertron's most remarkable feature.Outside of this however, Fall of Cybertron gets a little less easy to enthuse over. Graphically the game is average, the enemy variety feels pretty lacking and the plot is exactly what you would expect from an 80s cartoon franchise designed to sell transforming robot toys: uninspired, kind of silly and rammed chock full of fan service. It must also be said that what I tried of the multiplayer mode I found a little dull, which was a shame, partially due to how few people I could find playing. I dare to say if you took away the Transformers licence from Fall of Cybertron you would simply be left with a competent but unremarkable 3rd person shooter I would be hard pressed to recommend to anyone.But heres the important thing... It does have the Transformers licence. It's got it in truck loads, and it is the excellent - nay impeccible - implimentation of this licence that carries Fall of Cybertron from the pits of  mediocrity and makes it such a solidly enjoyable game.Would I recommend? Yes, if the thought of getting to be a Transformer sounds remotely exciting to you, then Transformers: Fall of Cybertron will not disappoint."

The multiplayer part of this game is okay, but could be worked on, for PS3 version. The plot runs smoothly and I liked how they presented the first playable part of the game. I highly recommend this game to any Transfan or someone new to the series to play it, but you should play War For Cybertron first even though it can induce a rage quite here and there, it will help in the long run, trust me."

They have kept to the lore of the original 1980's transformers, I loved playing as the ""Dinobots"" fighting against the ""Insecticons"" it brought back some great child hood memories. You will see many Autobots/Decepticons throughout the storyline that we all grew up with watching after school on tv, and it's great being able to play as them in this awesome game that ""High Moon Studios"" has blessed us all with!

The quality of the campaign has benefitted immensely from the removal of co-op like the last game had, which at first was a controversial decision by the devs but turned out to be the best possible choice. I had an absolute blast playing as racecars, tanks, helicopters, jets, giant bots, dinosaurs, and even grunts as I sneaked around with cloaking devices, grappled through aerial fortresses, crossed swords with decepticons, stepped on autobots, incinerated leapers, dogfought (is that a word?) with enemy planes, *SPOILERS*ate shockwave,*END SPOILERS* I could go on. For a long time. Needless to say the campaign was awesome and I will be playing it through several times again. The multiplayer portion of the game does not fare so well; I failed to see any improvement in the competitive or cooperative survival modes, and at any time you try to play you will either a) only find hackers or b) not find anyone at all. It's a shame HMS and Activision wont get their act together on support, I'd boycott them but unfortunately I have too much fun on their games to bother.

I said 8/10, right? To be completely honest, this game isn't ""The Best."" If you're looking for a game that provides a fairly exhilarating experience, one that you might want to even come back to, then this is definitley worth checking out. It's good for the first one or two runs, if that's only what you're looking for.Appeal? Me, as a Transformers fan, found this to be new territory. If you're looking for something nostalgic, don't come here. Yet this was new, as inrefreshingnew. the characters are all the same, with some new ones too. Any ""alt"" mode is a cybertronian form, meaning it appears very alien, giving it more of a sci-fi feel, and yet it still keeps that Transformers look. It reuses some abilities that we've seen throughout the franchise, such as levitating cars, rocket boosters, etc. Animations are beautiful. Aside from some sharp movements when the transformation animation starts, all animations are clean, and very satisfying. You can even track the parts while a character is transforming, and follow where everything goes.Aside from the models, the environments were fair, but I don't think I'm giving it enough credit. You have to understand that this was mainly quite high quality for its time, but now, it's not as good. I'd still say the environments do capture the ""war"" feel of the game. Many things are broken, you'll see lot's of things that can be used for cover, and lots of things that relate to where you are located quite well. I think my favorit detail was the animations, again. For one level, many the rooms transform as you walk through them, and other parts of levels transform, too, such as towers turning into cannons, etc.I also love the cutscenes. None are pre-rendered (except for the opening), but that's for the better. My guess is that it decreases the file sizes to be able to fit more game, but what I've noticed is that it gives the ability to pause the game mid-cutscene, at which point the game changes all the models to a neat hologram style, which is a nice touch. Otherwise, they're well-animated, frequent enough to be a main part, but not so long that they take away from the game.Playability and variety? This is where the game starts to fall behind. There's not too much worth in playing more than once, and I still am kind of upset at the whole multiplayer deal. (EDIT: Servers are back up and review may improve after playing a while!) Everyone kind of hates on the game since whoever hosted the servers too them down, and multiplayer's no longer available. I think it's mainly because most of the game's DLC is for multiplayer. But I think that the single player campaign is just as good. After all, that's what the game was designed for, right?So, variety... the game is fairly linear, with the occasional branching path to find some loot/gear. I do think that the style of the game, combined with the fact that there's nearly always an objective makes it more interesting. The linearity isn't as bothersome as some other games. Controls are nice, smooth, easy to learn, and actually quite easy to practice, too. But the game starts to follow a similar fashion after a while, throwning many of the same things at you. You'll see the exact same main enemies; I can even list them them out: soldiers, rocket troopers, and shotgunners. There's some more rare classes, such as titans or snipers, but those three are the most common.However,there's something about the characters that dosen't let them get old for me.And this is where more pros come in. Often, enemies will have scripted cutscenes with each other, which can be inturrupted at will to fight them. The game never really swarms you with the same enemies either (unless you count Grimlock's levels, which have the same three enemies each fight). It does try to dish out lots of variety, and, just like with the linearity, I don't find it as bothersome. The different characters all have different play styles. For example (and no spoilers here since you can see who you're going to play as in any given level without unlocking it first), Cliffjumper and Starscream are oriented to infiltrate and sneak around. Titans (not sure if that's the actual name), like Bruticus and Grimlock, are always told to destroy everything, and Leaders (still unsure), like Optimus and Megatron, usually break enemy lines to activate artillery or reclaim territory.I could probably continue, but the only final thing you need to think about is price. $50 isn't worth it. I blasted through the campaign in a couple days (my 56+ hours are trying to beat it in hard mode). I would definitely wait for a sale. 've only ever seen this go on sale for $12, so definitely worth it.Again, recommended to any sci-fi fan, especially TF fans. Lots of pros, some make up for cons. Only buy when on sale. But yes, this is definitely rocommended!"

The Autobots and Decepticons bodies change very fluidly, and have little animations in both forms that give them life.-Peter Cullen reprising his role as Optimus Prime.-Excellent sound-effects. The transforming sound really takes me back...-Very fun multiplayer (when not being gang-banged by people using hacks).-Multiplayer allows you to create your own Transformer, with some great options for mixing and matching parts from the stable of in-game models.-A reasonably well-balanced Class system in multiplayer, with interesting options as you progress. As you play and earn XP, you gain access to a few more weapons and abilities within each Class.(Decepti)Cons:-Multiplayer Class-progression gives advanced players even more advantage over players just starting out.A level 10-15 player will have access to additional weapon choices, as well as additional modifications to those weapons, and modifications to each Class' unique abilities. At 25, each class is  completely unlocked. I've witnessed a few Team Deathmatches (6 vs 6) where 1 side had 2 level 25s (the other remaining 4 were low level) which steamrolled over the other team, composed of level 15-20s.Experience + level advantage + inability to communicate/coordinate within your team = Terri-bad.-No in-game voice-chat system.-No in-game text system.-No pre-built in-game commands to give orders to teammates.-No ability to vote out other players.-No capacity to report cheating/hacking.-Lobby system is garbage. It's basically a matchmaking system that chooses a player as the Host. Host has a great advantage over other players due to low latency. Presumably, 1 of many hacks floating around, allows a hack-user to force themselves as Host all the time.A very fun game, with even more fun multiplayer. The ability to transform on the fly during battle - into jets, tanks, cars, etc. - combined with good overall 3rd person shooting mechanics adds spice to what could've been an otherwise tired deathmatching experience. There are other modes as well, Deathmatch, Headhunter, and Capture the Flag.Unfortunely Cheaters/Hackers in the multiplayer abound. I've witnessed characters using abilities and weapons outside of their character classes numerous times. Scientists cloaking, indestructible, and/or capable of firing off a complete magazine of a weapon instantly at targets with almost perfect accuracy. In some cases, insta-killing entire groups of players at ranges beyond standard. Very disappointing. The best (and only) thing you can do is to pay attention to the players that rack up ridiculous kill streaks, survive impossible amounts of damage/attacks, or obviously cheat, and simply leave the Lobby when you see them. It doesn't stop the cheating, but it saves you from the frustration I've experienced getting perpetually rolled by these wastes of skin.That being said, setting up private games with friends could easily circumvent this.

The definition explains why is it weird being completely a stranger to this universe :)Transformers is kind of a rpg and shooting game mix. You are playing with characters from different factions and experiencesing different styles. There is a nice robotic mayhem going on with a mediocre story accompanying with enjoyable chatters between characters. There is also a multiplayer option with various robots and skills. I have looked for transformer games and watched some reviews and decided to buy this one because this game is a bit expensive considering what it offers.Here are pros.- The game has a decent story for witihin the transformers universe. There are autobots, deceptions, megabots, weirdbots... etx. and there is a war going on between them for i do not know how long, and all kinds of chaos is going on over galaxies. So main story, which i stated as mediocre, is the fight and struggle between these robot factions.- The voice acting of the game is pretty good. I think the voice actors of the moive is also voicing these characters. Or maybe i am mistaken. But it is definitely not amateur bussiness.- Gameplay is smooth and optimized. You do not get much glitches or fps drops during the chaos happening around you.- Visual quality is nice enough.- The game is cinematic and this style is dragging you into the events, even when the events are not preticularly interesting. Sometimes i felt like i am watching animated transformers movie.- You are gonna be playing different sides of the story throughout the game. Which gives different angle and perspective to the story.- There are different weapon types and individual upgrades for them. Sniper, automatic, shotgun and some other transformer technologies are available. You have to collect some sort of points to be able to unlock them. On hard difficulty this becomes realy challenging. Weapons and upgrades are all ratable. They have a rating among the players who rated so you can guess if the upgrade or weapon is realy useful before you spend your money.- There is a transformation mechanic in the game. Your robot can transform into a vehicle. There are also other abilities like slinging through edges with a rope or cloaking to be invisible. These robot specific features are sometimes mandatory to use and this brings variety.- There is an online mode called ascalation. This mode summons waves of enemies to kill, classical enemy waves not like a robotic wave, and you and your friends have to hold their ground and defend their lives. There is a nice element of cooperation and collaboration in the multiplayer mode because each team member can and will have different abilities to help or protect others. Escalation mode has 15 waves.- Multiplayer has a character customization feature. You can set weapons for 4 different character types for later use.And some minor cons.- Game is hell of a fun but a little bit expensive.- Gameplay does not have a crounch or cover mechanism. Sometimes you will find yourself surrounded with enemies beecause of this. And the point ov view of the camera feels wrong, your character covers a bit too much of the view. This is my personal opinion.- Some DLC packages are revealing more of the story. This is also pricy for fans.- Multipalyer does not offer much of a fun because finding other players to play with is hard. You have to have like 5-6 other friends to play with. Otherwise you will be waiting for players.Summary: Buy it on sales. There are not much this kind of robotic games out in the market and this one is a pretty good alternative."

Transformers Fall of Cybertron is a totally awesome childhood reminding, third person shooting, singleplayer and multiplayer game. In campaign mode you get to play as some of your favourite characters, such as Optimus Prime, Megatron, Bumblee, Jazz and Cliffjumper, but for the REALLY extreme Transformer fans, you can rampage with the colossal Bruticus, the Combaticons combination form with 1000% health or the unstoppable Grimlock, a raging large, sword wielding with his T-rex form, equipped with extreme durability, booster charges and flamethrower breath. Not to mention you are able to use a large assortment of weaponry, like the Neutron assault rifle, a classic rifle with extreme firing speed and accuracy, or the Scatter blaster, a close range shotgun with some real firepower (literally), or the nucleon charge rifle, an awesome sniper rifle which will be even cooler if you understand the science of its name. But these are just the PRIMARY firearms, their is the mk18 scrapmaker which allows you to mow down your enemies in seconds, the corrosive slime cannon which gives you the satisfaction of disintegating your enemy by the molecular level, or use the vr cyber corrupter to force your enemies to fight for you, EVEN A TITAN CLASS ENEMY, but the real beauty lies in the chaos rift combustor, a grenade launcher that launches a grenade that dispurses more grenades, or the A4 pulsar cannon which launches electromagnetic grenade that stick to enemies and allows you to detonate by will. But multiplayer is even better, with the satisfaction of playing with friends and beating other people who are not easy cpu's, or escalation which is when you have to beat 15 waves of enemies with at least 1 friend with the maximum of 4. But in general, it's a really fun game and more addictive than a puzzle game on your phone."

It's hardly anything extraordinary but still manages to be an entertaining linear rollercoaster of Transformers sillyness with plenty of nods to friends of Generation 1. If you don't like Transformers, this game isn't going to change your mind about anything though and no one should probably pay the current full price of 50€ for it.The following points mostly apply to the campaign mode:+Looks, sounds and feels like an authentic 'Prime' continuity Transformers product+Proper sequel mentality with 'more of the same' bundled with new tweaks and little gimmicks+Campaign offers a nice mix of slightly different playstyles from both Autobots and Decepticons with stealth, melee and flying characters represented+METROPLEX HEEDS THE CALL OF THE LAST PRIME+Most entertaining credits roll I've ever seen in a AAA game-I had to manually download a file from Microsoft and put it in the game directory to stop the game from running first time installation every time on startup-This is one of those games that prevents Windows Mixer from identifying it properly to store the program specific volume level. Autobots, set volume to maximum every time and roll out-No manual saving though checkpoints are reasonably well spaced-Minor bugs still remain: got stuck in the floor a couple of times, some keyboard prompts to interact with characters or objects didn't do anything etc.-Linear to the point of being absurd at times-Weapon balance doesn't really exist as some of the weapons make all the others quite pointless in comparison-Boring weapon and ability upgrades. Increase rate of fire, increase clip size, increase movement speed, decrease reload time, zzzz....-Some collectable items (including blueprints required for weapon upgrades) are a bit too fiendishly hidden-Prerendered blurry 30fps cutscenes look jarringly bad compared to realtime cutscenes and the main game"

But the bad thing about this game is the controls and the fact that you can't bind the keys. The reason why I didn't like the controls is because the mouse/camera sensitivity. The x-axis can move faster more than the y-axis, which feels weird when you're trying to aim up and down. When you can't bind the keys, you can't set it to what makes you feel more comfortable when playing the game. It's just like the controls on Transformers Rise of the Dark Spark, but that game is more ♥♥♥♥♥ier. Overall, this game is good and entertaining."

,Recommended,213120,28622016,"Posted: 24 December, 2016",all,painedforever,"As much fun as War for Cybertron was, Fall of Cybertron improves on it in nearly every way. From the weapons systems, to the upgrade terminals, to the set-pieces, Fall of Cybertron is a better game, period. And possibly exclamation mark, exclamation mark, exclamation mark.The story picks up right after War for Cybertron, and ends before the start of the Prime cartoon. The final Autobot transport, the Ark, is ready to leave, but Megatron isn't done with them just yet...The first game was an amazingly good time, and having a co-op campaign added to it. Every stage had a big old punch up, and each campaign had a multi-stage boss fight to cap it off. But what really set it apart from previous Transformers games was how responsive the controls are, and how great the gameplay was. So, Fall of Cybertron had its work cut out for it.In all honesty, I did not expect Fall of Cybertron to be as good as it was. It is fairly scripted and very linear, and you do need to play through the campaign multiple times to get all of the upgrades, and at some point you can start predicting where enemies will spawn. But the presentation is so good that you are willing to forgive it. Poor Peter Cullen gets stuck with all of the ponderous lines, but at least he also gets the best music during his fights.In the meantime, we've finally gotten the Starscream (Sam Riegel) we always wanted, overly dramatic, incredibly incompetent in command, but a murderous maniac on his own, a truly worthy successor to the Chris Latta Starscream of G1. And Jazz (Troy Baker) is as cool as we remember him, with the voice that Scatman Crothers gave to the character back in the day.You get a definite progression of power as you go along. In the early stages, you're constantly in danger of being overrun by mooks. But by a certain point, you have enemies fleeing you in panic as you tear apart marauder tanks, and you can't help but feel as though you've gotten just that good.Make no mistake, Fall of Cybertron is a much harder game than War for Cybertron. In WfC, most of my deaths were due to missing a jump, or in the last boss battle. But in FoC, I would get taken out by hordes of mooks if I wasn't careful about where I was stepping, and wasn't keeping an eye on where they were spawning from. It is a game that encourages forward momentum and fast gameplay. Hiding behind cover will not get you anywhere.Definitely recommended for all Transformers fans, and maybe even for folks looking for a decent third-person shooter."

I have very few complaints. Story wise it continues wittth the Prime/Aligned continuity and follows it well with included easter eggs left out of WFC. The weapons look unique and some return from the first game. You are unable to choose characters per mission which I didn't like as much but fits well with the game. The game looks great and feels great. The negatives are that some of the story parts in a game that still leave you with control of your character (much like half life 2's style) can be slow and limiting. (Minor ending spoiler won't give too much away.) At the end it gives you a choice, but you get the same ending cutscene for either one which makes your choice useless. Other wise great game.

,Recommended,213120,33621655,Posted: 17 July,all,Worlds Saddest Man 2012-2017,"This game was my GOTY for 2012 and still one of my favorite shooters to date. I absolutely adore transformers, and back in 2012 i was extremely disappointed by how downright awful the Michael Bay movies were, and this, as well as War For Cybertron, the admittedly less-good prequel, provided a breath of fresh air for me. I played and beat the game on Xbox back in 2012, played the hell out of multiplayer, and when i saw it on sale here, i had to buy it and replay it. I was not disappointed in the slightest, except for a few, small nitpick problems.Let me just go ahead and get the negatives out of the way so i can proceed to gush about how truly fantastic this game is. Firstly, the PC port has a fair number of minor, but annoying bugs. For instance, many NPC characters who are vital to interactive segments in the game became stuck in objects, in walls, or simply refused to offer the button prompts necessary. This was easily alleviated by a quick reload through the very generous checkpoint system. Secondly, the camera has occasional issues, such as not moving to follow characters during extended canned animations, and adding a mind-numbingly obtrusive depth of field filter during the final level which it refused to remove for a long stretch of the level. These types of bugs usually resolved themselves, but some required a checkpoint reload. Finally, some of the driving controls are rather stiff on mouse and keyboard controls, but this can be easily overlooked.Now, the pros of this genuinely fantastic game. First off, this game is optimized extremely well. The only real issue with the graphics is that there is rather noticeable visual tearing during cutscenes, but the game runs incredibly well. Next, the gameplay. The game's pov shifts from character to character each chapter, with the exceptions of chapters II and III, where you exclusively play as Optimus Prime, and chapter XII and the latter half of chapter XI, where you play as Grimlock (who is undoubtedly the best character in the game). The characters all have very diverse playstyles, and you will grow attached to a couple characters. Personally, i loved the snarky, arrogant Decepticon interrogator, Vortex. Anyway, the gameplay is extremely polished, and you will love it once you get used to the occasionally stiff controls.I'm going to end this review here under the auspices of not wanting to ruin the experience for you. Play this game. It's very good.And also you get to play as a ♥♥♥♥ing fire-breathing, robot-eating Tyrannosaurus Rex. What's better than that?ADDENDUM:The multiplayer is very fun, but the servers are Very, Very Dead."

It's the game's best feature and includes excellent voice acting and writing. It's by no means a deep or highly abstract plot, but it's very well polished. I think of it as 2 parts camp for every 1 part dark, for a tone that's very close to an old Saturday morning cartoon. The campaign is linear but has a lot of variety in gameplay and fairly open levels (similar, on balance, to the campaign of Halo 1 in these regards). Voice acting before and during levels is excellent, as is the overall sound design. The transition between cutscene and gameplay isn't visually jarring, and the pace of both gameplay and story are smooth and brisk. The shooting is faster and somewhat more visceral than I'd expected in a game about robots, but the melee combat is much slower and clunkier.The multiplayer mode is buggy and sparsely populated, but still technically functional. It looks like 2/3 of the game's features are accesible only in multiplayer mode, which is a shame, as it's not especially fun to play multiplayer matches.It's worth keeping this game wishlisted until the next sale. Hopefully they release a singleplayer-focused sequel some day. I'm not a Transformers fan (quite yet), so I'm recommending this game as a gamer."

,Recommended,213120,33781248,Posted: 25 July,all,Cardassia Did Nothing Wrong,"An improvment over the first in every way, very few issues were found. Not many bugs (one where I couldn't activate consoles in an area but that occured right after a check point so it wasn't too bad of a problem), and the driving, while highly improved, still felt a little off. The only sour note I had was the horrible remix of Stan Bush' You've Got The Touch in the ending credits, but other than that I'd heartily recommend this game to anyone and everyone."

I encountered several game breaking bugs that forced me to quit the game and restart, the controller bindings are terrible and they do not work correctly in the menu screens, and there are some options that you just cannot trigger using a controller, so it is safe to say that the game didn't port anywhere near as well as it's predecessor.All that being said, the plot is fantastic, more familiar faces from my childhood show up, and the whole thing is one big nostalgia romp though concepts first presented by the G1 cartoon all those years ago, so despite the bugs and the fact that you really cannot play this without a keyboard, I still recommend it to any fan of Transformers."
