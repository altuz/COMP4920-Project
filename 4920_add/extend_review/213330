Not only that, but because of this that means there are many criminals hidden that you have to defeat before aquiring them as spare characters and the missions, like the last game, are replayable to get all the secrets that you either missed because you didn't see them or missed because you didn't have the powers needed.There are a lot of villains in this one, some obscure ones too like Hush too. The story is very fun, but also quite epic too which is what I've grown to learn from these Lego games and I have a hell of a lot of fun with them too.If you liked the pervious game, you'll love this one and if you want to buy this one and havn't played the first you're likly to enjoy it as there is no continuation with the story of either games, but it has been improved immensly since the last game."

,Recommended,213330,10070885,"Posted: 10 May, 2014",all,Whoota,"Of all the Lego games out there, Lego Batman 2 is the best I think. It took what worked from the other Lego games, and added more stuff to make it even more entertaining. What I think is most important to take into account here is the effort that was put into the voice cast. This was the first lego game that featured talking characters and they did one hell of a job. You'd expect this kind of quality from the Arkham games, but Lego has quite the list of A-list voice actors repraising their roles from the 90s cartoons. Additionally, this instalment adds the members of the Justice Leage as playable characters, making this the best Superman Game ever made.There is one reason to play this: to fly through the sky as superman with John Williams' score in the background. Need I say more?"

It's so dumb first it saves and then you can't move. So you end up keep being killed by random spawning enemy's.Other then that great game and a good deal in the Lego Batman Trilogy Pack."

He saves the day. But, an angry Lex has a new weapon used to let the villains of Gotham loose from Arkham Asylum, the Joker wreaking the most havok. Batman manages to re-capture most of the villains, but the Joker is still on the loose. The rest of the game is an epic story of cat vs. mouse searching and fighting in classic LEGO fashion. Destroying stuff and collecting studs. Unlocking characters and wreaking havok.What's noteworthy about LEGO Batman 2 is the full voice cast, the open world Gotham, which, while not huge, is respectably big if you're running around as Batman instead of flying across the map as Superman. The graphics are impressive, it seems TT keeps outdoing themselves with the lighting and textures on a number of the models. Gameplay is classic LEGO gameplay. Jump, punch, switch character, special move and camera/movement.I have to say, especially with how the game ends, I'm very excited for LEGO Batman 3, which will be set in space featuring a different villain, Green Lantern's foe Brainiac.9.3/10"

In my experience, LEGO games are not so much about ground breaking, innovative gameplay; but rather, immensely enjoyable fun for the whole family that comes in all kinds of assorted flavors. Personally, I find the Star Wars flavor to be the best out of all of them, but for the same reason that a die-hard LOTR fan would tell you that the Lord of the Rings LEGO Games are the best.Overall, if you haven't ever played a LEGO game, then don't just buy the ""latest and greatest"". Buy a flavor you love, and I promise you won't be disappointed :)"

However, if you've played other new Lego games(such as Lego Marvel) you will be disappointed by several things. The flight controls are wonky, the map is hard to use, and no matter who you unlock you WILL have to use Batman&Robin's suits now and again. It's still a great game though. Also, you get Superman very early and he's one of the strongest characters in any Lego game. Then you just start breezing through."

,Recommended,213330,33872897,Posted: 28 July,all,Noah,"This was an excellent game in the LEGO franchise. Its my personal favorite out of the batman themed games they made.Pros:The levels were fun and engaging.The humor was well done, and the story is decent.The game gives you access to a huge open-world LEGO version of Gotham city, which has tons of things to unlock and many side-missions to complete.The graphics are great, and they still hold up even 5 years after the initial release.Cons:The character roster is a bit small compared to the other LEGO games, but they still got all the ones people really want, and all the other ones for the nerds are included in the 3rd game.The flying controls are odd. In some ways they're better than the other games, and in some ways worse. In levels and in the batcave, the controls are the same as other games, but in gotham its this weird thing where you have a target that you aim in the direction you want to go, which is a challenge if you just want to get over a fence or something, but it makes it easier if you're just trying to get around.I rate the game 9/10 overall. Would definitely reccomend to anyone who likes LEGO games. If you like the darker batman games like arkham asylum, this will probably dissapoint you though."
,Not Recommended,213330,21515451,"Posted: 27 February, 2016",all,CharlieLima79,"LEGO, Batman, computer games...you would think combining them would create something wonderful. Sadly, not with 'LEGO Batman' and 'LEGO Batman 2'. I played 'LEGO Batman' and didn't really like it, thinking it was rather dull, frustrating, and hard to control with the keyboard. I later went on to 'LEGO Batman 2', hoping and half expecting improvements.'LEGO Batman 2' is a whimsical and charming game, and improved upon its predecessor by having actual voice acting in the game. (The first game just featured characters making sound effects, like grunting.) However, this game still has the clunky keyboard controls (the default configuration makes no sense to me), unfriendly camera angles, and wonky pathfinding from the first.In the end, 'LEGO Batman 2' is a mediocre PC port of a console game at best. TT Games did not bother to optimize it for the PC. The game does not automatically start in your system's default graphic resolution on the first run, which is unacceptable for a modern PC game. Plus, 'LEGO Batman 2' is best played using a controller because its keyboard controls are unintuitive. Reconfiguring the default keyboard controls improved my gaming experience a bit, but I still had to fight the weird game camera positioning.Furthermore, 'LEGO Batman 2' is really designed for co-op play because the character that I was not controlling was not helpful in fighting off bad guys and solving puzzles in the single-player mode. Yet, the game does not offer online multiplayer. Having two people playing side-by-side may be nice (and nostalgic) if it is done on a console, but less ideal on a PC, especially if both players have to huddle around a single keyboard. That may be acceptable or tolerable back in the early 90s, but not in the 2000s.Both 'LEGO Batman' and 'LEGO Batman 2' capitalize on our love of LEGO and Batman. It is unfortunate that TT Games did not put a bit more effort into making 'LEGO Batman 2' more PC-friendly, let alone improving on its gameplay. It is frustrating and disappointing to see TT Games seemingly coast in what they do despite having the lucrative properties of LEGO and DC characters to work off of."

Gets a little frustrating when I have to bale them out of a level that they are stuck on. You basically have to rewalk the whole level to see what they missed.

,Recommended,213330,21184047,"Posted: 13 February, 2016",all,Foxysen,"Lego Batman 2 DC Super Heroes is yet another yet another LEGO game made by Travellers Tales. This one released in 2012. Yep, casual platformer, but the first Lego game with talking characters and free-roam. It also came out for Xbox 360, PS3, Wii, WiiU. And it also had handheld versions which are Nintendo DS, 3DS and PS Vita. They are quite different. Like, a lot of stuff in gameplay is different, levels were changed around, abilities. Oh, and no free-roam.Consoles also had DLC and achievements. No achievements for Steam. As for DLCs, you are missing out on Heroes and Villians packs, each with 5 characters. Which are probably as good as reskins.Technically, while it's better optimized than Lego Harry Potter 5-7, it's still known to be quite buggy. It still crashes sometimes, you see. I actually had two crashes in a row for pre-last level. Well, at least this game also introduced checkpoint saves.It also was using the language that I had on my OS/computer, not what I set in Steam. Which annoys me, since hearing voice in English and seeing subtitles in different language confuses my mind, as I understand both. No, translation wasn't word-to-word, that's why.Anyway, once again, it's a casual 3D platformer where you have infinite lives, has almost no challenge in combat, beat up everything to collect as much studs as possible to unlock neat stuff of tons of chars and collecting everything.Again.But this time with new additions.Again.If forget that these new additions are quite important to Lego series.For normal levels there isn't much new to write about. They seem a bit more fun. And whole combo-numbers thing changed: instead of working as studs multiplier like in the first game, it does something else. If you do a throw on enemy while the combo is ongoing, upon death he will drop 100 * Combo Number of studs. And if you do the finishing move thing, the combo number will be doubled. It's not exactly as enganging mechanic, just kinda there to make you vary things up, I guess. Shame that x10 is the max.Oh, and no more vehicle levels. Instead we have on-rails shooter. Which is nice fun, sensetive aiming aside.Now, as for important ones, characters can now talk and hub got expanded enough to be counted as free-roam now.Thanks to characters talking, the plot stepped up. While many will miss lego meme action, I think that it's a welcome feature. Like a good action/adventure/comedy, the story is quite awesome in this one, enganging. It sure beats a bit of repetetiveness of Lego games. It sure shows that this game for once has it's own storyline instead of being forced to do what movies have. Well, if forget that it also flopped a bit: It seems to mostly focus on Batman and Superman vs Lex Luthor and Joker. No villian story. And the other DC heroes, which are Justice League, appear only in the last two short levels. For shame!Ah well, at least it's awesome to play as overpowered Superman.Heck, there even was ""Lego Batman Movie"" released in the next year, which is based on plot of this game, even using modified cutscenes from here.And then there is freeroam. Between missions and so you can explore the Gotham city, which is three island with tall buildings. And tall buildings. With lots of goodies hidden in them. And you might think: Hey, I can just fly with Superman to get all the goodies. Not to mentioning that game playes Superman theme when you fly with him, which is super awesome. But sadly, the flying control in free-roam sections is badly done. I mean, it's all fine when you are just flying, but when you want to land on top of building then it goes awry. I don't feel like descripting so I shall just yell ARGH. There, good enough of explanation?Fine. It's mostly because you can't just drop immeditly to the ground and trying to tilt character down to the ground while flying will probably making him suddenly turn around and refuse to land. Or don't know, it's just painful.Then again, game itself thinks that it would be too easy if you want to get gold bricks this way and instead it will want you to find Robin or Batman costume on the ground and then climb on top of building without losing it by changing character. Which is fun from what I tried so far. Yay climbing.Navigating through it isn't as easy either. Sure doesn't help that path-studs seems to not always appears in time or take sharp turns.Anyway, for story walkthrough it was a fun game that I beat on a single breath, but I am not sure how it is when trying to collect everything. Still will take it over older titles."

I've played only the story so far, with no side missions and it took me roughly 8 hours to complete (blame all my other, unplayed games). The story was simple but fun and well executed, with a good dose of humor. Switching between characters could use some work though, as well as the AI of your fellow hero(es), and sometimes characters can get stuck in the environments. Other than that, it has no big flaws. It's a free roam game, so there's plenty to do besides doing missions. The game showed me I only completed 17.5%, so it could take you well over 30 hours to fully complete; it's BIG.The graphics were excellent, with plenty of detail even though it's all LEGO parts. The animations were cute, the voice acting brilliant. Fun times all around !If you have the money to spend, go buy it. Do yourself a favor.[Rating: 83/100]"

In a matter of 8 hours I managed to grind my way through the boring levels that really didn't feel fun like some of the levels of the other lego titles. and grab all 20 or so red bricks and grab 500,000,000 studs in that time as well. it was insanely easy to get money, and characters.overall the game is just too easy no challenges exept for the lego gotham gold brick level. doing freeplay on the levels didn't feel like a real free play because in the end of some of the levels you'd still need batman and robin to proceed through them so it felt like playing the game in story all over again. Now the way the story worked was really horrible. you play through 100% of the story as batman and robin(sometimes), then superman comes in about 10-15% in. The rest of the justice league doesn't show up until the last 2 missions of the story. only 10% of the story. BUT I loved the uniqueness of each of the characters, the open world style gotham was the most fun of the whole game. I absolutely loved going through gotham and grabbing the gold bricks, each time getting one was different. and saving the citizens was also just a blast. like i really was trying to save gotham's citizens from danger. The vehicle's were fun, each of the boats had different speeds and handling capabilities, as well as the cars. The planes were fun. BUT the helecopters were a challenge in themselves their handling was really difficult, long hard turns, and rising in the air(including flying characters as well) was slow and just no fun to try out. If you were to get this game it'd be only for the open world hub, not the levels or the story.  really I'd give it a slight 6/10 just because of the fun I had with the open world."

This strategy has proven to be incredibly successful for both Traveler's Tales and publisher Warner Bros. with LEGO games consistently outselling numerous other big name properties and franchises on the consoles and now to coincide with the release of Jurassic World we get the LEGO version which also happens to contain condensed LEGO versions of the first three movies including, of course, the biggest blockbuster of 2015 so far (until the new Star Wars movie arrives) - Jurassic WorldThese people obviously never watched Alfred Hitchcock's The Birds.A Screenshot of LEGO® Jurassic WorldBy: Sir FaultyIf you are not a fan of this kid-friendly branding exercise, the humor or the simplistic puzzles then I suggest you stop reading now and move along. However, if you happen to enjoy a bit of LEGO mayhem in-between playing your other games, enjoy the sly parodies on display or just happen to be a massive fan of the film franchise then LEGO Jurassic World pays just enough lip service to the originals that should have fans chomping at the bit.Once again you will find yourself exploring various film scenes from all four of the movies smashing everything in sight to bits while piles of unbuilt LEGO will bounce up and down around you indicating that you can build some sort of device or structure that will enable story progression. While LEGO Jurassic World does incredibly little to tinker with what makes these games so addictive and well loved amongst many, the game mechanics have been slightly overhauled indicating that Traveler's Tales seems to be getting a better handle on the LEGO engine than its previous iterations but like any film licensed product LEGO Jurassic World has the air about it of something that was rushed to the market in order to meet the deadlines determined by the release of the film. Characters repeatedly get stuck in the environment causing the player to have to reboot out of the level and restart it. This can sometimes get incredibly frustrating especially when you are near the end of a level only for this to occur forcing you right back to the beginning. Traveler's Tales have implemented a save feature at certain mid-points in the levels but they very sporadic with some not having any save feature mid-way at all.LEGO Jurassic World_Jurassic Park 3-5A Video of LEGO® Jurassic WorldBy: Sir FaultyPart 3-5 of Jurassic Park in LEGO Jurassic World playing story mode. Played on PC through Steam. Game can be purchased at the following link:-http://store.steampowered.com/app/352400/While I did not experience many bugs throughout my first playthrough, perusing the forums reveals a host of issues that are preventing people from completing the game. While from a production stand point LEGO Jurassic World looks fantastic and is a very strikingly good looking LEGO game; the game does tend to feel a bit more rushed than its predecessors but I suppose that boils down to the fact that most of the scenes in LEGO Jurassic Park mimic the fight and flight scenes from the original movies which does require the action to fly thick and fast. With that being said there is hardly a lull in any of the games 20 chapters (5 across each film) as they move at a breakneck pace. As a huge fan of the franchise I really enjoyed the LEGO treatment given to the films so much so that LEGO Jurassic Park has emerged as my favorite LEGO game to come from TT Games thus far.Where the game does tend to falter is in the use of its voice overs. Certain scenes are mixed in with the original dialogue from the movies but the movie dialogue sounds tinny and it becomes quite jarring to hear famous lines from the movie sound like they being beamed in from the inside of a soda can compared to the clarity of voice work composed specifically for the game.Now I am sure we can settle this amicablyA Screenshot of LEGO® Jurassic WorldBy: Sir FaultyLEGO Jurassic World is not going to win over any new fans but for those who enjoy these kinds of games it's a fun and wild romp through all four films and is the perfect game for families playing some couch co-op over the weekend. The humor is as sharp as ever and should have most adults that play it giggling away like children. LEGO Jurassic World gets the all clear in my books. You are free to enter the park.If you enjoyed reading this review please follow my curator group at:-Curator RaterWas this review helpful?YesNoFunny141 of 171 people (82%) found this review helpful"

I don't completely know why I got this since I didn't care much for the first LEGO Batman, but this one is an improvement. I'm not too far into the game, but I can tell you it is definitely not bad.The story isn't too bad. The Joker is trying to defeat Batman once again, but this time Lex Luthor is by his side along with many other villains. Like LEGO Marvel Super Heroes, this game mixes the super hero/comic book storyline with what you expect from a Lego game very well.The gameplay is pretty much what you expect from a Lego game- do missions, build stuff, get gold bricks, get characters, etc. It is fun, but there's something about the LEGO Batman games that seem a bit boring to me as far as levels go and I don't really know what it is. When you aren't doing missions, you can free roam around Gotham City, like you can free roam around New York in LEGO Marvel Super Heroes, and this is pretty fun.The graphics for LEGO Batman 2 are about the same as most Lego games. Gotham City has the kind of look that reminds you of the Batman Arkham games, which fits very well with Batman. The animations look good as well.Probably the main problems I have with this game are what I mentioned before about the levels and the amount of characters. I don't have all of them yet, but there don't seem to be very many. From what I can tell, there's probably around 50 of them. Not bad, but still much less than I expected.LEGO Batman 2 definitely isn't the best Lego game so far, but it is definitely not the worst either. It has a plot that goes good with both Batman/DC Comics and Lego, entertaining free roam, and a good amount of characters. However, if you're looking for a Lego game that you'll be playig for hours at a time, go with LEGO Marvel Super Heroes or LEGO Star Wars.I give LEGO Batman 2 an 8/10."

This LEGO-ized version of the DC Universe is right at home among such Batman interpretations as the Burton films or the incredible Batman: The Animated Series.  The first truly open-world licensed LEGO video game from TT Games, LEGO Batman 2 features by far the best video game adaptation of Batman's home city.

,Recommended,213330,20473759,"Posted: 11 January, 2016",all,devilheihachi,"This is the 2nd Lego game I've played, the first being Marvel Super Heroes, and I found this game to be quite enjoyable. I enjoyed this a bit more than the Marvel game but I think a lot of that is because I knew what to expect from it and didn't have as much trouble navigating and using the map to find collectibles. The story portion of the game is short but is pretty fun and light hearted, yet fits in well with the DC and more specifically Batman universe. There are a good number of heroes and villains that you can unlock and play as from both the Batman, Superman and Justice League comics for those familiar with the 2 comics. The only downside to this is that there is not a whole lot reason to use more than a handful of core characters that have abilities that you will find useful quite often. But on the other hand, some characters are basically clones of others in terms of their abilities so you can take your pick of who you'd rather play as.If you want to just play the story mode, you could probably beat it in 10 hours or less. However there is so much more to do between collectibles and replaying levels in Free Play mode to try and find things that you weren't able to when you played in story mode. Also this is a fun game if you have a kid and want to play local 2 player co-op. I've played this some with my nephew who is 5 and while he's still learning, he can actually do pretty well. I would probably say that it's best suited for kids 7+ but still fun to have something that the 2 of you can play. Overall there is a lot to do and if you plan to get 100% as I did, then be prepared to put in some hours. This seems to be a staple of the Lego games based on the 2 I've played. However, my time played as recorded by Steam is a bit exaggerated due to times when I left the game on pause for long periods of time and times that I played with my nephew on a separate file. However, if you want to go for it all, I'd expect 25-30 hours. The only bad thing about the game is that you can only save your progress at checkpoints during levels and usually when you get collectibles it auto-saves. That's why I had to leave the game on pause for long periods of time a few times because I really had to be somewhere and just didn't have time to get to the next collectible or checkpoint. So just keep that in mind when deciding whether or not to continue playing a level, go for particular collectibles, etc.Overall, I would definitely recommend this game as something fun for all ages of gamers."

If not, you don't know  what you're missing!As usual, this game improves on the system a bit.  The character's powers are quite a bit more varied than usual.  Some characters actually have multiple powers, instead of the usual one-power-per-character.  They also used the power-by-costume system for Batman and Robin, which I'm not really a fan of, but it does add some puzzles to the game.There is also an open world for the maps between the levels.  Think of GTA, but smaller.My only complaint is that there are no achievements for the Steam version!  To get cheevos, you'd have to shell out almost twice as much money and get it on PS3 or 360.

We have most of the other lego games and i think they are all are fun for the kids. I have one problem with this one. Running or jumping near the edges causes the characters to slide or fall off the ledges. Its almost a glitchy effect.

Many parts of the game is actually challenging in figuring out exactly what to do. The huge array of vehicles and characters keeps the game interesting. And the free style makes it even more fun. Kinda a calm blend of action mixed with some GTA for good measure. Worth a check out."

The graphics are not perfect, and the open world aspect could use work. The flight controls in the open world and TERRIBLE. Over-all, it is a good game. 8/10"

You can drive in and out of the Batcave in free roam, as well as the the enterance for the Batboat and Batwing. I love everything except a couple annoying little things. It is always night and raining. This is exactly how i thought Gotham would look, but it gets a little annoying after a while. LEGO needed to make a daytime option for the game. The flying controls are a little frustrating, but i found myself not flying that much. There aren't a huge amount of characters, but you just have to make do with what you get. Green Lantern was the most dissappointing as you can't make anything with his ring, except for certain points in levels. And once you complete the game, there are some constructs that you can make that stretch all over Gotham. I found this really annoying as when you were driving you would have to doge them as it would sometimes flip your car/bike. One of the most annoying problems was that there were no steam achievements, so once you fully completed the game, there were no steam achevements to do.It sounds like this game is really bad, but i just pointed out the main problems with it, everything else is great.I highly recommend this game.Score: 8.5/10"
,Recommended,213330,17568654,"Posted: 16 August, 2015",all,DigitMason,"As a follow-up to the first LEGO Batman title, LEGO Batman 2 has a lot going for it, including a much larger cast of characters, varied levels and a concise storyline, but I think it stands out most for the open-world of Gotham you can explore and (chronologically) the first inclusion of voice-acting to the series. In comparison to its prequel, a number of improvements made the experience much more seamless, including better controls, split-screen multiplayer no longer restricted to a small portion of the level, and puzzles that made better use of additional characters. The vehicle levels, while repetitive, were much more fun to play this time around. I did find some of the Gold Brick puzzles in the open-world somewhat frustrating, whether by poor design or requiring a specific character (and often specific suit). Overall a solid game, the one downside being I felt the new character roster wasn't appropriately integrated, only requiring Superman or Green Lantern a handful of times, and newcomers Flash and Cyborg serving almost no purpose."

The gameplay, story, cinematics, and audio are all great.  The music is from the 1989 Michael Keaton Batman film.  They even got Troy Baker to voice Batman.  No bugs!  I will forever curse the first Lego Harry Potter for having a bug that kept me from getting 100%.What's also nice is that the publisher also put out a movie that's a compilation of the cutscenes.  Both of my kids love it!My only beef with the game is that the split screen SUCKS.  Let's say I'm Superman, and I'm melting something with my heat vision.  If my son moves his character at all, the split screen moves and takes Superman off the target.  Very frustrating!"

This ain't 1995 guys, get with the times.  I refuse to play any game that takes over both my monitors and resets my resolution in the process - leaving my desktop and explorer windows jacked afterwords.  In addition, most folks have two monitors now and prefer to multi-task when playing games, so this is inexusable.Seems like a straight console port to PC with no effort at all to utilize PC functions.  Get's a NO."

One of the funner free roam experiences in a Lego game.  Sometimes I just drive around Gotham just to drive.The story is still solid but I did not enjoy it as much as the other Lego hero games.  It remains nonetheless a solid entry with high replay value for all ages.I recommend it especially for kids and parents that like to play co-op.

This is the only Batman LEGO game I've played thus far. The music is excellent, it seems to be pulled directly from the Tim Burton movies, which is great! The stories for the missons are fun, but ultimately don't really matter. Good voice acting to boot.I almost exclusively play this with a young child and it's a blast."

76561198031383772,Recommended,213330,35483099,Posted: 4 October,all,Revanaught,"This game is one of the earlier Lego games with voice acting.  As such it still manages to have a lot of the old lego game charm, where a large chunk of the jokes are told via movements and gestures rather than words.  A lot of the spoken jokes also run very well.  Some fall flat, but overall, the game is well written and quite funny.  It's refreshing to see a Batman game where Batman isn't portrayed as an omniciant god with a gadget for every situation possible.But what really got me wanting to play this game was Superman.  There are so few good Superman games out there, and this one does pretty well in his regard.  Again, the writing is really well done, and you really do feel like you're playing as Superman when you've been playing as Batman for the first couple hours, and then superman shows up and does everything biggers, better and faster.Unfortunately this game has some of the worst flight controls I've ever experienced, which makes playing as superman in the overworld really unpleasant.  Which is a real shame as that's what I was looking forward to the most.  But, that's really the only negative point I have for this.  This is absolutely a solid and worthy lego game."
