Haven't had any issues that everyone else is talking about. Possibly lucky? I duuno. But I have been having a blast remembering how fun this game is. Good times.
,Not Recommended,213350,14526658,"Posted: 18 February, 2015",all,Kaydee,"Thought this would be a whole overhaul of the original game, with higher standards of new generation systems.I was wrong.Higher polygon models for the main characters (Kurt, Max, Dr, and bosses) and the rest are plain old characters from the original, and texture goes the same.Some animations are played in the original 4:3 screen with black bars on each side for 16:9 monitors, and occational sound glitch, that you will have to exit the game and re-run to bring the sound back to normal.Don't get this game, instead get the original MDK 2."

Pick up the original instead. I think I prefer the old look to HD anyhow."

However this HD edition has some technical issues, notably that the controller support in the options is a lie, M&K is the only option. Also the last 3 levels can be a bit annoying. Don't pay full price for it."

Don't support this lazy Attemp at a remake."

Even if it worked properly, which it doesn't even come close to doing, it is a lazy HD remake at best.

You're much better off getting the original as this barely looks any better and suffers from way more issues."

I don't know what the problem is but i've been a fan of the game for a long time and just found on steam so i decided to buy it. But when i go to launch the game, the main menu does not display my curser, nor text. I eventually started the game by randomely clicking buttons, and still, no captions were shown in the cutscenes or anything. COMPLETE RIP OFF. I've been trying and trying but cannot find a way to play my favorite childhood game. :( VERY Dissatisfied."
