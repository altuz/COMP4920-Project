76561198061113226,Recommended,213610,7747616,"Posted: 25 November, 2013",all,JCorvinus,"Sonic Adventure 2 finally gets its deserved port to the PC platform. It's a fast-paced action platformer that expands on the gameplay of it's prequel. It isn't the most polished game out there and it is definitely showing its age, as it was an early 2000's title. If you like timed challenges, love racing the clock and enjoy spatial dynamics in a game then Sonic Adventure 2 is great for you. Players who prefer more abstract gameplay, dislike challenges involving physics and moving objects, or otherwise have a low affinity for platform games will not enjoy this title as much.The port itself is a mixed bag. It supports high resolutions and the 360 controller, both of which make playing on PC a better experience. On the other hand, there are issues involving loading as the game will sometimes refuse to load if certain programs are running like flux and rainlendar (anything that uses rendered overlays). The launcher is also poorly designed."

,Recommended,213610,7751783,"Posted: 25 November, 2013",all,NightBlader,"Love Sonic Adventure 2? This port is very faithful. You need a good cpu to run it, and if you don't, you're better off emulating it.If you don't have a sense of nostalgia for this game, the controls take getting used to, and doing the ring dash is off at times. Worse case, when you have to do a ring dash in the air as Sonic after getting the Bounce Bracelet.You have 3 main character types. Speed (Sonic and Shadow), Shooting (Tails and Eggman), and Treasure Hunting (Knuckles and Rouge). Speed is what you expect and works just fine for the most part except what I explained a bit ago. Shooting is much slower, but pretty fun to shoot things and gain huge combos. Treasure Hunting can either go in your favor, or frustrate you, depending on your luck. All 3 have really tight control, so you can stop on a dime.With linking to a portable device gone, the Chao system is more limited now. You can't interact with Chao from other files, Special Chao and even Maria's theme are impossible. However, with the trainer linked at the bottom, it becomes possible. It'll depend on how you feel about using something like a trainer. The rest remains the same.I very highly recommend a controller for this. It's much more difficult to control with the keyboard. With a keyboard, you can only run, never walk since a keyboard is digital and not analog. And you can never be precise with your movement. Even when I first tried a keyboard, I instantly got thrown off. Bottom line, use a 360 controller, or be like me and use a PS3 controller using the ""Better DS3"" tool.What's really cool about this PC version is the amount of mods made by fans. So anyone who misses the cheats from the previous versions, can use them here. Most of the mods are for looks, but there's Character Selection, Spin Dash for the alternate speed characters (Amy and Metal Sonic), and even a Super Sonic mod.Another mod that is note worthy is the Chao Stat Multiplier. This increases any stat increases a Chao gets by 5 times. So for example, instead of +2, you get +10. If you ever felt getting stats up took forever, this cuts down the fat. This is also good if you don't wish to use a trainer outside of getting the Maria theme.Despite the downsides from this version and the initial game, if you can look past them, I highly recommend this game.Here are some mods.http://mm.reimuhakurei.net/?page=sa2mods(Install into the Steam SA2 folder)http://chao.tehfusion.co.uk/(A Chao Trainer for SA:DX and SA2 on Steam) [Can also be used to get Maria Theme]"

But while the other Sonic Adventure was available for the PC at one point (2 disc version) this one came a little too late. However for those HD purists this game supports HD resolutions and fast load times. Just make sure you have an XBOX 360 Controller as this game is way too hard with the keyboard. For those people who have integrated Intel HD cards that supports pixel and vertex shading, you may have a hard time with the beginning level of the game where a certain portion of the game does not render propery (it starts with a truck going downhill) It won't happen on non intel cards however. Worth it to check it out though if it's on a sale. Being I was a huge Sonic fan however I did buy it the day it was released as this was the one that I wanted when it was finally released over the other Sonic games."

,Recommended,213610,19577599,"Posted: 8 December, 2015",all,RockstarCRO,"I played this back on the gamecube when it was available. It was quite revolutionary back then as Sonic came out in full force in 3D and the tracks were no longer linear and some freedom regarding movement was given. I will say this about the PC version though, Sega definitely betrayed their gamers by not making this game complete and by adding DLC to it (which was common core to the old game - such as 2 players local).In Sonic Adventure 2 you may play as the ""good"" side with Sonic (featuring Knuckles and Tails) or the ""bad"" side with Shadow, Eggman and Rouge). Although six playable characters in total, all have their own unique features in the game. Sonic and Shadow have speed runs where they run through a level. Knuckles and Rouge have sort of a free roam mode where they are able to glide/fly and use their powers to achieve whatever their goal is (activate 4 beacons for example). Tails and Eggman control their robot mech's which add a sort of total destruction to the game. Each level is uniquely different and it seems they really cared about what they did when making this. Emblems and Chao's are also available to collect throughout the game. Chao's can be sort of used as power ups but are treated as pets in a separate realm in game. I should add the two player modes are absolutely awesome (especially when racing one another on foot). Some of the game modes include action race, treasure hunt race (free-roam sort of thing), mech battle mode and lastly a go-kart sort of racing feature. Some modern day gamers may become tired of playing through a story mode with such a rhythm... then again, some how people are still buying CoD.Visualsare definitely old school but are good enough to keep you interested. Some people really don't like old games as they can't wrap their head around the lack of polygons. I understand that. Thegame playshould be good enough to keep you going.Soundsare off the charts and provide for a fun atmosphere. In the first level (playing Sonic), you will be chased by a truck. To this day, is still one thing that gives me goosebumps when playing a game.Overall, a good game and a recommended on sale. I do think Sega should include the DLC free as it is sort of putting a middle finger up to gamers.(Old school rating : 8/10)RATING : 7/10GameplayBStory / CampaignBVisuals / User InterfaceC+Sounds / MusicC+Replay-abilityC+OverallC+ScreenShots :Knuckles CANNOT fly but he can glide and climb up pretty much anythingTails vs Dr Robotnik in their mechsI'd like to see snowboarders do thisSpeed run"

This isn't to say there are none.This game is a nostalgia trip for me, as a Sonic fan. The gameplay is fairly solid; controls function well, the levels are easy to navigate, and the tutorials are almost not there at all. I will admit that it gets repetitive, though.

Yes. Would I recommend it to fellow Sonic fans who have never played it? Absolutely. Would I recommend it to a new gamer? Perhaps.

So I know the game off by heart. For this review, I use keyboard controls.Short story: GET THIS FOR THE CHAO GARDEN!--PRO's--- Chao Garden- Music- Childhood memories- Controller supported- Controls can be changed--CON's--- Tails/Eggman have slow/laggy movement- Knuckles/Rouge has camera issues (may be down to Keyboard controls)- Chao Karate & 2 Player Battle is cut into DLC (Greedy Shods)- Local Multiplayer (No Online Mode)The camera issues don't bother me, I understand due to using a keyboard that the camera will not be as great and to be honest, is just the same as the GC one. It is just a port, no real improvement. But Tails has missing animation frames and seems to stop before turning which is an issue, specially when you fight Eggman at the end of HERO story due to you are so slow. Same goes for Eggman, making their levels appear to have frame-rate issues.Even though the tags say ""Multiplayer"", it is local multiplayer only, you need a mod to race others online. Local multiplayer is not good either you share the same keyboard making it cramped, bad idea there SEGA.Only get this game when it is on sale or if you really miss the Chao Garden & don't have the original game anymore. Otherwise give it a miss for now as it is not worth the full asking price."

,Recommended,213610,30841519,Posted: 30 March,all,JerseyXS97,"I love this game, and while it has its flaws I would definitely call it one of the better Sonic games if you were to look at the Sonic/Shadow gameplay alone. The Knuckles/Rouge and Tails/Eggman gameplay is something that I don't mind myself, but they are definitely a lot slower and less satisfying to play compared to the speed stages.Pros:----------Fast-paced action stages with Sonic and Shadow. These stages are the game's main attraction, and are easily the most fun.Eggman makes his first playable appearance in a main-story Sonic game. It isn't the best appearence as the gameplay can feel a bit slow and boring in the walker, but it's something.The story is told from both sides. This is something we won't see in another Sonic game as we don't get to play as a villain team in any future installments, so it's unique to the series as far as I am aware.Cons:----------Among the three types of gameplay (Speed, Shooting, and Hunting) there are only a combined 30 stages, 10 per stage type with those 10 being split up between each character. Sonic has 6, Shadow has 4, and so on.The bosses that are unique to this game are laughably easy. On the other hand, the rival fights are incredibly irritating to deal with and basically end up being a spamfest between both sides.If you want to go for the full 180 Emblems you will need to grind,a lot. You'll need to end up knowing the levels like the back of your hand if you plan to A-Rank all of the missions. Unfortunately the rewards for doing so, while cool, are not worth the effort.The voice acting in the English port. The Japanese speech is much shorter than the English translation, but they didn't compensate for this in cutscenes. This causes characters to talk over each other very frequently.Unlike Sonic Adventure, this game forces you to play as all of the characters. I don't mind it myself, but for someone who just wants to pick up and go for the fast-paced gameplay that Sonic is known for it might be a huge issue.Indifferent:----------The stage design. A lot of the themes present are bland and repeated fairly often, but at the same time the levels themselves can be really fun to play through.The Chao Garden. I would definitely put the Chao and the Chao Garden on the Pros list, but the amount of grinding you have to do to actually get all of the Emblems from this side-quest is ridiculous. Still, I would love to see this fine-tuned and brought back in the future."

,Recommended,213610,16062753,"Posted: 29 May, 2015",all,Foxysen,"Sonic Adventure 2 is a 3D platformers that mixes three gameplay styles in one game, being part of Sonic franchise. It was one of the last games to come out on Sega Dreamcast in 2001 and can be taken as Sega's ""farewell"". Shortly, it was ported to Gamecube, getting ""Battle"" subtitle, bringing new addition to multiplayer mode and chao garden. It also had small tweaks to it and didn't have neither small Downloadable Contnet that Dreamcast version had, mostly skins, nor Dreamcast's VMU to play tamagochi with your chao.And now in 2012 Sega decided that Sonic Adventure 2 might be great enough to get HD rerelease for PS3, X360 and Steam, with it coming to PC for the first time ever.So, here we have our modern Steam version of the game. As you noticed, Sega decided to separate game into just ""Sonic Adventure 2"" and DLC ""Battle"". DLC adds all the new content that Gamecube version had over Dreamcast one, which isn't much for single-player game, unless you want all achievement. Technically, just ""Sonic Adventure 2"" is more like Sonic Adventure 2 Battle with content cut down to Dreamcast level, not real Dreamcast version, the difference being in various small tweaks. BUT it does bring Big The Cat cameos in every level back. Funny.A big feature of modern ports is widescreens support. All of the gameplay is now taking whole space of your wide monitors, with only Full Motion Videos and some of the cutscenes still retaining 4:3 aspect ratio.It's quite a solid PC port, I don't remember seeing any new glitches. But multiplayer is local only.Game has both singleplayer and multiplayer modes to play.Now, I didn't get to try multiplayer, but it's a competive one. Could be lots of fun. But the only thing I can say is that it's common knowledge that Amy is OP.Single-player is divided into two campaigns, Dark and Hero. Each of those two have the same three gameplay styles for three characters. Speed sections are the ones that Sonic fans expect and they were greatly improved over Sonic Adventure one, making them feel tight, challenging and more designed to be the blast to replay and better your score. Mech stages aren't as fast-paced and have more of primitive shooting mixed with platforming, with the Sega's style of ability of ""put few enemies under the target and then release fire to have them all killed for big score"". Treasure Hunting are more of exploration of huge stages, where you have to get yourself familiar with mazey layout and then use hint system and radar to track three pieces of needed item.And while it does improve on gameplay, it has a fault of getting on more generic territory when it comes to universe. Gone are colorful otherwordly strange levels, instead you will spend time in more generic places, like city, forest and space station. The most Sonic-like stage you will get there is egypt-style with ghosts. Spooks. Then again, these generic stages are still colorful and are nice in their own way.Music once again changed style. It's not as varied as the Sonic Adventure, aside from stereotypical rap for Knuckles and jazz for Rogue. Everything else is mostly techno and guitar work. And yet it's awesome, catchy and you will remember them for a while! They also provide intense feel at times.Plot is quite darker this time. Instead of seeing perspective of six characters individually, you will get storytelling from the two sides. It's not deep and got some holes in it. Strange stuff, that sometimes feel were left out. Animation in cutscenes also got improved, they aren't too hilarious anymore. They sometimes move like puppets though. And I have to say that Dark Side is done better than Hero Side. Darkies are the ones who lead the plot and deal with mystery of Shadow. Heroes are just confused Sonic and his friends reacting to whatever happens.And I have to say most important thing. The campaign is NOT fun to play for the first time. It got a huge pacing issues that ruin fun and turn it into patience test.Those three gameplay styles are mixed together seemingly randomly and change every single mission around. They are differently paced and fit for different kind of gamers, and even if you enjoy them all, they swap around to quick to get used to. Even worse is that plot often on Hero Side's is being interrupted by Knuckles with his slow-paced gameplay. Oh yes, and some enemies are quite cheap. I have no idea how to avoid attack of liquid monsters in last levels. Though, I don't think that Mech stages enemies are cheap, it's just that after getting used in earlier stages that you can just walk until the end calmly don't get you ready to actually avoid projectiles.But once you get through campaign, you will get ability to select any level you want... And this is where fun begins. Not only because you can select any gameplay type you feel like doing right now. There are 5 missions for every level, the first mission being just ""beat the level"" and the last mission always being Hard Mode. Even more, for first time ever in Sonic games, it got a rating system. Upon completing levels you will be given one of the five grades, A being the highest, based on the final scores. While time score matters there, you will get a lot by destroying gold robot, doing tricks, defeating as many enemies in a row as possible and collecting more rings. As said, Sonic games are easy to play, easy-hard to beat but difficult to master. Even kart stages start to make sense when you have mission not to touch walls, having to drift into corners (release and press jump button again while turning to get into drifting mode). Some of the mission grade A requirements are quite insane though, so I doubt that you will 100% the game easily at all.Actually, just knowing the pace of the game after beating it will help you enjoy game more when rebeating it. Which quite explains why those who played the original version praise Sonic Adventure 2, while newcomers get bad taste of it.You also will get to unlock Boss Rush mode.And Kart mode, which is more of bonus game. Drifting is nice, but it's not Daytona. And characters aren't balanced around each other, some character have no chances to keep up with AI cars, who don't even make look that they their cars are being controlled in same ways.Developer video will be unlocked in options after some amount of hours being played. Where developers will tell you few small anecdotes/facts from the development and that's about it.Oh, and this time, getting all 130 emblems will give you not only achievement, but a little bonus level. Shame that in order to do that you have to also get emblems from Chao Garden part of game. And DLC too.Yea, Chao Garden, that tamagochi thing. Where you have to find chao key on stage and also feed chao 10 animals you brought along. And then watch them grow. And stuff. It's not really a thing for gamers. Then again, Sonic games's main auditory are young people anyway, but still, not something traditional gamers will care about. Just grind with 10 animals over and over again.Dreamcast actually had this little thing where memory unit had it's own control on it and you could take it with yourself as ""portable handheld"". Though, more like tamagochi. And you could raise chao on it when you was outside of home. Or at least find useful items for them. So it was making more sense back then.So, not a good game to beat, but awesome one to master. Recommended to Sonic fans and those who tend to replay stages they liked, instead of abandoning game after beating it.Then again, there isn't so many 3D Platformers on Steam right now, so may take it anyway."

Firstly I was 6/7 years old at the time, everything looks different then second off, Sonic was the character that solidified my interest in games so I wouldn't hesitate to get if I could, I did and was not disappointed.  I'll explain that elsewhere.  Due to being young I never saw SA2 advertised but games within its era made references to it I only understood years later, so you can imagine how  felt when I got this and realised that it is some of the best sonic team have to offer.Sure, it was easy to lose momentum in areas and having to wait to activate the spindash took getting used to but once you got the full set of powers you were almost unstoppable.  I know thta people would like another game like this but it's often better to leave things where they are.  Yuji Naka's not there anymore and neither are Yoshihisa Hashimoto or a lot of the development team, that vision's gone.  It's not impossible since Sonic Lost World PC has shown SEGA are doing their best to listen to fans but a lot of things are better left alone.Bottom line, Story's great, multiplayer is good every now and then,  the character's are fleshed out enough and the gameplay is simple enough to warrant replayability.  I know many people find the original cast's voice acting cringeworthy but hey, it's better than mainstream series e.g COD, Tomb Raider, Battlefield and the rest where cusses are warranted every few minutes.

It was the first sonic game I had played (My parents were nintendo freaks so I didn't even know sega was a thing until  this game).  It is one of the best and probably one of hte last good 3D sonic games.This game features 2 story modes and a third unlockable story after completing the first two.  It also includes a multiplayer mode in which you get to play against your friends in 3 gameplay types all based on the story mode levels.  You can at any time revisit story mode levels and complete them again with different objectives than your first time around like collecting a certain number of rings or under a time limit.One of the other major features is the Chao Garden.  You get to raise these little blue creatures called Chao and they have their own stats that go up by feeding them items and animals found in the levels.  Once you have raised your chao long enough you can put it into a race or a karate tournament.The final thing I can say is go ahead and get the battle DLC for the extra 3 bucks.  It gives you a lot of extra content which includes the multiplayer modes.  13 dollars is a damn good deal for this game

I said ""NO, mom I can't return the DVD"" my mom responded ""what did you scratch the disk or something??” I said ""Hell NO mom do you honestly think I would do anything to harm this dvd"" my mom said ""don't talk to me like that"" I said “I’ll talk to you however I want ♥♥♥♥♥"". my mom gasped and smacked me in the face I fell to the ground my mom said ""that movie has been a bad influence on you I’m going to the library to return it immediately"" she walked over to the dvd player where the dvd was currently playing and was going to press the eject button but, before she could there was a blue blur the flew out from the TV and push my mom on to the floor. I knew who it was and I knew he would put an end to the injustice my mom was committing. My mom said ""what the heck was that"" the Blue blur responded with "" I am the fastest thing alive I am protector of all living things that cry out in misery I am sonic the hedgehog and I am a nightmare to you"". My mom said ""I'm calling the police"" sonic said ""you're too slow"" the vanished for a millisecond then reappeared holding the house phone. He crushed the house phone in his hand and said ""try to keep up!” My mom screamed and ran into the kitchen. Sonic raced after her and I followed. My mom grabbed a kitchen knife and said ""I don't know who you are or what you are but I'm going to stab if you don't get out of my house right now!!!!!” Sonic said ""don't tell me what to d-"" as he was talking he was interrupted by my mom's knife. It slashed him across his Achilles tendon. Sonic sad ""NO NOW I CAN'T GO FAST"". My mom said ""I know and I’m going to put an end to you right now"" sonic mumbled ""YOU ♥♥♥♥♥'. My mom put her right foot forward and charge toward sonic she had the knife against her stomach with the blade pointing outward in the direction of Sonic’s heart. I knew I had to stop this because if I didn't sonic would surely die. I leaped forward in front of my mom. The blade went straight into my throat. My mom yelled ""OH MY GOD"" blood shot out of my throat and I fell. As I lay on the ground awaiting my eminent death I feel a strange sense of contempt within my demise. I knew my death would be for a good cause, FOR SONIC."

With dual storylines that consistantly left me wondering ""What's going to happen now that {insert major in-game event}?"" The voice acting, despite not being Sega's best, was sometimes pretty hillarious! (Totally not Sega's intension, just due to tha fact that there are times that characters cut each other off mid-sentence). The Chao Garden was a nice distraction from the main bulk of the story, and the multiplayer is just hillariously fun(and somewhat chaotic due to special abilities)! My only major complaint is the odd City Escape bug. There IS a solution to this, but it's by someone outside of Sega. I usually am not a fan of developper bashing, but this is a problem Sega should've found when the game was originally ported to Steam, and I feel kinda disappointed that there hasn't been an offical patch yet. That aside, Sonic Adventure 2 is an amzing game that, aside from the afore mentioned bug, is solid overally, and well worth the $11 CAN price tag!"

I love this game a whole lot, but if you don't share the same nostalgia me and many others might have for it, you definitely will not like this game. It dates itself very easily with a very clunky engine, and it's noticable almost right from the start of the game. Even BEFORE then, you can spot how awfully choreographed the cutscenes are, which I think is enough to leave a bad impression to anyone starting the game for the first time.If you're a Sonic fan and haven't played this game, do yourself a favor and do so.

I traveled at blistering speeds through unfamiliar worlds in red and white shoes, with nothing to stop me from overcoming death-defying obstacles and blasting through countless amounts of enemies.The amazing voice acting Ryan Drummond instantly brought life into the unbelievable world, and the story felt like a blast of fresh air. The pursuit of the blue blur's dark doppleganging enemy's identity is explored and often provides insight on what actually makes a person human. The game makes the player question their own morality and gives numerous options such as choosing to make heroic or dark choices throughout the main storyline.Never after completing a video game have I sat for hours and pondered the experience. This game not only introduced me to the obscure ""Sonic the Hedgehog"" franchise, but helped me have more of an appreciation for video games as an artform.I higly recommend this game to anyone looking for an exhilarating rush of excitement and wonder."

,Recommended,213610,20766831,"Posted: 26 January, 2016",all,Aro,"I reviewed this game years ago, but I'm rewriting it to be a little more informative than my previous entry.Sonic Adventure 2is without a doubt my favourite installation in the Sonic the Hedgehog franchise, the amount of time that I spent playing this as a child on the Gamecube is impossible to measure. This game has higher replay value than almost every game I have ever played and the Steam Version only adds to that further, I'll elaborate a little further into the review.This game offers the choice of playing the story out from two different perspectives, the hero side and the dark side. The story isn't anything overly unique, but a typical Sonic the Hedgehog scenario: Dr. Eggman is trying to take over the World with the assistance of two new entries to the series (at this point in tine), Shadow and Rouge. The World is powerless to stop them after taking over the abandoned space Colony ARK and reactivating a weapon capable of destroying planets, thus leaving it up to Sonic, Tailsand Knuckles to stop him.The core gameplay consists of three different stage types:- Action Stages: Play as either Sonic or Shadow in high-speed race to the finish levels overcoming numerous obstacles and challenges. Definitely the most fun of the three different stage types and the closest thing to the original Sonic feeling.- Treasure Hunting: Play as either Knuckles or Rouge using hints and a radar to locate hidden pieces of the master emerald around various maps. This is a mixed bag for most players as it can prove to be frustrating unless you've played the levels before, but it breaks the ganeplay up nicely in my opinion.- Shooting Stages: Play as either Tails or Dr. Eggman (yes, you get to play as EGGMAN in this game, why haven't you already bought it?) in a set of shoot-em-up style stages. Another nice addition to break up the gameplay a little bit and can be a lot of fun with the exception of a few stages (Eternal Engine, ugh), it's very satisfying to rake in a huge number of points and go for the A ranks.The game unlocks some minigames as you progress through the story mode stages, Kart Racing and Boss Battles. Kart Racing is a nice addition, though admittedly nothing overly fancy, just a generic racing game with some unlockable karts, a throw back to Sonic Drift. The Boss Battles are as you'd expect, boss rushes for each story mode once you complete the stories.Arguably the best feature of the game is the Chao garden. Chao are creatures that you can raise and train to play Racing and Karate mini games. What Chao themselves are is difficult to explain, but I've always seen them as virtual pets in the case ofSonic Adventure 2, you raise and train them by collecting certain items in the main game stages and delivering them to the Chao Garden after obtaining a special key in the stages. There is a lot of depth and information to cover on this so I won't go into it any further to prevent a bigger wall of text, I suggest reading about them on the SA2 Wiki if you're curious.Everytime you complete a stage or mission, you acquire an Emblem, of which there are a total of 180. Emblems are another thing that extend the replayability of the game as collecting them all requires completing different missions from different stages and achieving A ranks. They aren't mandatory for completing the game, but they definitely give you a reason to keep coming back for another round.While a lot of fun, it is difficult to play the Steam version on a keyboard, this is a game that is definitely better with a controller, I strongly advise using an Xbox pad if you have one. The lack of online multiplayer is a real shame which is the only real fault that I have with the Steam version of the game, the oopportunity was there but it wasn't taken. Local multiplayer is available for the 2 Player Battle DLC, a must have for this game, very fun and competitive multiplayer gamrs to be had for all stage types with additional characters to chose from.I will defend this game to the death against haters and those who don't appreciate it's replayability, however, one thing that has always and will always bother me about this game is the clunky camera. Many times have a been short of an A rank or even lost a life as a result of the camera glitching out. Thankfully this doesn't happen too often, but you will notice it upon a playthrough of the stories, particularly in the Treasure Hunting modes.All in all, this game is worth every penny, it is practically given away during sales. If you're a fan of the series, I would strongly recommend playing this game of you haven't already, it's one of SEGA's best. If you're new to the series, it may be a bit unusual to get into at first, but I would still recommend giving it a try."

If you want to play sonic but you're afraid of crapy games like Sonic Boom, or Sonic 06, this game is for you!The gameplay in the sonic/shadow levels is very fun and can be played over and over again without becoming boring. The other levels where you play as Knuckles, Tails, Eggman, and Rouge are not as enjoyable, but they're not bad.The story is okay, but not very deep until you get to the final levels.The chao garden is very fun, but not worth spending fifty hours in just to raise the ultimate chao (even if you do, they all eventually die anyway)For me, its the endless striving to achieve A ranks and perfect scores on every level (sonic/shadow levels) that makes me love this game. But there are countless other awsome things to enjoy as well!"

Lots of fast and consisted fun and action from beginning to end, My only real criticism are the camera can be wonky at times, especially of u go of the designated route, u change it but it moves out of veiw the moment u touch the control stick and nothing in the game or manual tells u that in the Kart Racing Levels, u can drift by releasing and pressing the Accelarate Button again, while pointing the control stick in the direction u want to go. The treasure hunting stages can be tedious but only if you don't use the hint monitors and the Omochaos that help u find where the emeralds/keys are(which is what u are supposed to use in the first place) and contraty to popular belief, u can use the hints and still get an A Rank, even the game manual tells u to ""use few hints and finish the stage quickly to get a higher rank."" The mech shooting are a lot of fun and it can be pretty cathertic blowing up bots and while Tails/Eggman don't have a speed mode like Gamma from SA1, they still move at a moderate pace and can finish the stage quickly, if u don't spend too much time trying to shooting and blow up everything; the key to getting a higher rank is to target multiple objects quickly while maintaining a steady pace through the level. The all really long mech stages in my opinion are Eternal Engine and Cosmic Wall. Overall, Sonic Adventure 2 is a solid, great, and fun Sonic game and videogame in general, I highly recommended to anyone."

Don't let that be a factor that makes you change your choice of buying this, though.Sonic Adventure 2 managed to successfully continue the formula of Sonic Adventure in a slightly altered way. The game is split into three styles, the speed levels (Sonic/Shadow), the mech shooting stages (Tails/Eggman) and the very, VERY bad treasure hunting stages (Knuckles/Rouge).The speed levels are the best part of the game. No doubt. But, they are slightly more linear than SA1's Sonic stages, which is a disappointment. Luckily, they are still awesome.The mech stages are clunky but bearable. Just be ready for some annoyances.The treasure hunting is despicable. Luckily the stages are usually rather small and are not as common as the other stages.While SA2 is flawed in some major aspects, the game is pretty darn replayable. The game has an improved Chao Garden from SA1, which is very addictive. Plus, every level has 5 missions, and if you want to 100% the game, you will need to A Rank every stage and fully complete the Chao missions.Also, SA2 has probably the best multiplayer in any main-title Sonic game. So that's a plus.Ultimately, I do recommend SA2HD, and it is pretty cheap online. If you want to experience a bit of a 3D Sonic classic, then pick this up."

Instead, it is the remake for the Gamecube; however, you have to pay to access those extra features. This version of the game is shown to be the Dreamcast version, but with some of the Gamecube features (Back Market and the Fortune Teller for example.) Basically, this is the remake with the extra content removed. Unless you wish to fully complete the game by reaching 180 emblems, you will NEED to buy the DLC. The DLC adds a few more emblems to the game that you will need to get to unlock the hidden stage in Stage Select; moreover, these are mandatory if you wish to unlock all of the achievements.In short, you have to pay to access content that SHOULD ALREADY BE GIVEN TO YOU."

For the people driven by nostalgia, this will be a sour trip, or a fun revisting of a childhood game. If you're new to this game, you might want to turn back.Sonic Adventure 2 is the PC port of one of the ""best"" Sonic games. It was pretty fun back then, and now that I went back to it, I'm kinda worried. Sure it has the iconic ""Escape From The City"" music, but Sonic Adventure 2 isn't very memorable. The level design is.... cool, I guess. There's a lot of different themes, and it is pretty cool. The platforming levels are pretty cool, but some levels with robot powerups and stuff are just downright annoying. This game is a slippery platformer, but it still has some charm.The chao raising is what everyone remembers, and for good reason. You get to raise your own Chao! YEAH!I can't tell if this game is outdated or not, because the nostalgia is getting in the way, but it can be fun, sometimes.You're going to have to play this game is you want an honest review, because I heard about people who loved it and people who despised it.

Gameplaythe Gameplay is split into 3 styles: speed,treasure huntinghunting, and mech shooting. with the speed you take control of Sonic and Shadow and the levels are centered around that aspect so it isn't as open as adventure 1 but still the levels are a TON of fun.Treasure hunting (I couldn't think of a better name) is where you take control of rouge or knuckles and you go through these large stages climbing and gliding to collect 3 things that the stage needs in random places and I really like this style. Now mech shooting in this you play as eggman and tails targeting onto as many robots as possible for the best score and again this is a style I like.Music; The music is awesome I loveGraphics: the graphics are really good (look these last 2 aren't that important to me so I keep them to a minimum.Story: ehh Don't want to spoiler it to much to sumarize just look up The Completionist's video on SA2 and get the story from there.Overall 8.5/10 Great game"

This was the first game I ever owned back on the Nintendo GameCube and I have many fond memories from my childhood 'rolling around at the speed of sound' . So, when I heard it was available on Steam I had to buy it straight away. Sonic Adventure 2 Battle has an amazing story line which is playable from both Sonic, Tails and Knuckles' point of view or Shadow, Eggman and Rogue's. The best part of the game by far, however, are the Chao Gardens. The Breeding and later unlockable Hero and Dark gardens offer the players the ability to raise 24 Chaos at a time and compete them in karate competitions and races for badges and toys for their gardens. You can breed chaos together using heart fruits to pair up traits and make rare chaos. I promise that you will spend more time in the Chao garden than you will playing the actual game. That being said I did notice a few glitches which although annoying at times did not influence the game play. Overall, a great game which is definitely worth the paying for!"

To this day, I still question if I would notice nuclear war, or if the sounds of ABUUU ABUUU will drown out the noise.For serious now, if you get this, give up on life. Fix the junko controls and find a way to use your controller, then get through the 'demo' (at least the demo has snowboards and decent music) so that you can access the Chaos. After you fill up a garden with Chao, dowload the Chao Extender mod and kiss the sun goodbye.Chao/Chao"

But it could be better.In Sonic Adventure DX, you're having a little ""world"" to travel in. Compared to Sonic Adventure 2, you're just going from mission to mission. It was more fun to see this world and actually try to find the missions.Most of the levels is very fun. The Knuckles levels could be really hard as always. Maybe too hard this time.The levels you're playing as Sonic and Tails is battle levels.

I'll have to start with the cons.Jankier controls, Control on the DC and GCN versions weren't bad, but now at a pinch it feels more like controlling at the game than direct response.Sound Mixing is from hell, Don't listen to this game at full volume with a headset, you'll get a headache in 2 stages, Given that the Mixing was improved in the GCN version, this is off-putting as the worst.Random Driver crashing, Yeah, make it to the Egg Quarters to see what I mean, If your driver just got reloaded or there is a noticible skip, either way this was never fixed.Random Graphical glitches... everywhere. This one is painful, at times Rouge's textures wrap wrong, other times Eggman's Drivers/Animals don't even appear in the HUD.Now the Obvious Cons are out of the Way, Let's get to the Game itself.Sonic Adventure 2, This game has shown age considerably, but it's still rather fun. Despite the Steam version being the absolute worst port of it so far...

76561198086782861,Recommended,213610,8855208,"Posted: 26 January, 2014",all,Ice QB,"One of my favourite games ever. The story is cheesy, with terrble but lovable voice acting and a somehow heartwarming final chapter. Essentially, Dr Eggman releases a super powerful weapon that his grandfather built years before, known as the ultimate life form - Shadow the hedgehog. Shadow tells eggman that as a reward for rescuing him, he will tell him of a way to achieve world domination. Shadow shows eggman to ARK - A space Colony that was abandoned when Eggmans Grandfather was arrested, and the place where shadow was made. On the ark is a weapon of mass destruction, the eclipse canon, which can blow up pretty much any planet when it has all 7 chaos emeralds. Rouge The Bat, a thief appears and agrees to help them find the emeralds. Sonic on the other hand is getting chased by the police, who somehow think the famous blue hedgehog hero guy is suddenly black.Enough about the story, the main gameplay has 3 varietys, Sonic and Shadow have the speedy platforming levels. you have a spindash, you grind rails, get some great powerups, these are by far the best and momst interesting levels in the game. Next are the Treasure hunt levels, featuring knuckles and rouge. I personally enjoy these, the characters are fast, have good attacks, the levels are designed creatively, and knuckles music is usually pretty great, if incredibly cheesy. Finally, there are the worst levels in the game - Mech levels, in which you are Eggman or Tails, piloting a mech and shooting things. these levels aren't terrible, however until you get the jet booster (It lets you hover after a jump, to make platforming more accurate) they can be disgusting and offputting.My least favourite level in the game is the 3rd level on the dark side, Sand Ocean. You're eggman, doing tricky platforming with moving platforms and stuff, it's very dark, the music sucks and you don't have the booster, making platforming horrendously tedius. To make matters worse, you're surrounded by quick sand, so missing a jump will result in death.The game has quite a few bosses, some better than others. The standard GUN robots are easy and I wouldn't call them good bossfights. The last eggman/tails bossfight is challenging, the last 2 bosses of the game are pretty great, the second last being really difficult, the Last sonic v shadow fight is alright, it doesn't make it explicitly clear what you have to do though, so get creative. The game does have a bossrush mode, so Bosses are readily replayable. I wouldn't call this game hard, it's pretty easy to pick up and play, though it does have  maybe 2 partially difficult levels and a difficult bossfight, nothing you can't overcomeAfter the main gameplay is the Chao garden, you raise a chao as a pet. Take it from me, I've owned this game on 4 other systems, the Chao garden is just the best thing ever. So much charm, so much fun, so much personilisation. For those who wonder what I mean, try giving nothing but birds to a chao, and make sonic give it them. Within a few hours, it'll turn pink and grow jesters like a NiGHT character, Give it just tigers and It'll turn green and eventually blue, and grow sonic spines (Do it with shadow and it'll be black with red) This is just a few of the things you can make.The music is just fantastic, Jun Senoue is back with more great music, alongside many other artists. The games main theme is 'Live and Learn' A great hard rock ballad, The pop rock 'Escape from the city' By Ted Poley accompanies Sonics first level, with a fantastic bassline. All of knuckles levels feature cheesy raps, but they aren't as bad as everyone says (A ghost tried to approach me and got married) Shadow has as Techno theme in his levels, Even if you aren't buying this game you should definately look up the soundtrack, in true SEGA/Sonic Team fashion the music is truely brilliant. Buy ths game."

Critics seemed to be on the same boat as well, IGN back then gave the game a 9.4/10 upon it's release.Although that was back then...... now a days Sonic Adventure 2 is often deemed as the most overrated game in the series, and most tend to be bashing the game.Including myself, I could never understand why people were saying that SA2 was better then games like Generations and Unleashed which are my favortie main series Sonic games.I have no expirence with the original Dreamcast game or even the Gamecube Port, I have SA2 for my PS3 and PC.This review will be kind of a rough look see into both Adventure games to see which one is my favorite.Sonic Adventure 2 is fun just like the first Adventure game, but there both rather rough around the edges, while one might do something better then the other, the other does something better.Sonic Adventure- Better Music- More interesting Level Design- A more fun way of story tellingSonic Adventure 2- Better consistency, lets face no one liked Big's fishing levels even with how short they were, and Amy's gameplay could of been better- Better graphics- Better controlsI am going to say that both games have their issues and positives, so i'll just say there just as good as one another, although Adventure 2 is still definetly fun to play, it could be worse, but it could be better as well.8.0/10I don't care for the chao gardensTomarrow, Friday July 22nd 2016 will be the announcement for the 25th anniversary title. Will it be Sonic Adventure 3? I have no clue, but it would be interesting to see what will the next title will be. :)"

After being an all-time favorite of mine for the last 15 years, it makes me happy that a lot of the same gaming mechanics are the same, which allows new players to discover the game for what it truly is.One addition which adds to the playability of SA2 is finding Big the Cat wherever the player goes. He could be hiding literally just about anywhere, and for players whom have played this game before, it's a new refreshing way to travel through the game all over again and rediscover new easter eggs. I would say this is similar to Cream the Rabbit flying above Station Square after the Casinopolis stage in SA.Despite some shortcomings like the difficulty of finding power-up items and the redundancy of trying to max out your Chao's stats one Chaos Drive, Coconut, and animal after another, this game is nothing short of amazing, and I assure you that players will be satisfied with it completely."

While fun at times, turning is slow and locking on emits a very high pitched sound.Knuckles and Rouge's stages have you finding emeralds and keys in a variety of maps; however, unlike in Sonic Adventure DX where you could chase all the emeralds in the map, you can only go after one item at a time. The camera also takes a while to adjust to in their part of the game.There is also an extra chao garden where you can raise chao pets, get animals and drives (capsules) from the main game to raise their stats, and have them compete in several competitions such as racing and karate. There are also several upgrades (some mandatory while others are optional) that you can find throughout the game that will aid your character's abilities.Despite a few confusing parts in its story, I found it to be pretty enjoyable overall.

I will admit there are various plotholes within the story. I don't really care though because the story itself it entertaining probably only beat out by the originals. I also love when characters cut each other off in cutscenes! lol The story basically without spoilers is that Eggman wants to take over the planet using a weapon of mass destruction as bait. On his journey he finds his grandfathers greating accomplishment, Shadow the Ultimate Life Form. Shadow shows eggman the Space Colony Arc and how to use the weapon. Rouge then shows up and offers to help them find the chaos emeralds. On the hero side Sonic escapes from the government, he was arrested because he was mistaken for Shadow. After running around ramped for a while he finally gets captured so tails has to free him. Knuckles is searching for the pieces of the master emerald like always. When they catch wind of Eggmans plans They follow him to space to try and stop him. I made all of that very vague so I didn't spoil all that much.-GraphicsThey aren't the best because game is decently old, and they could only do so much when remaking those old models. I personly find the game very nice looking. It's art style really fits the theme of a game about an anamorphic blue hedgehog.-GameplayThere are three diffferent gameplay types across the six characters. On the Hero side Sonic: Speed levels, Knuckles: Treasure hunting, and Tails: shoot em ups. On the dark side Shadow(best character N/A): Speed levels, Rouge: Treasure hunting, and Eggman: Shoot em ups. The speed levels are what they sound like, you are racing through the level as fast as possible while trying to rack up points from killing enemies, collecting rings, and most importantly a time bonus. The treasure hunting levels you are searching for the objects, either the master emerald pieces are keys. Even though they are not designed for speed they still go reasonably fast. Finally the shooting stages. I find these fun, the goal is to reach the end of the level while racking up as many points as possible, mostly by hitting as many targets as you can at once. The controls are smooth, the level designs are nice, and each level has 5 different different missions. If you have an A rank on every mission and have all 180 emblems you will unluck a special stage.-Chao GardenThis is the main reason that I, and many people still play this game. You get your own Tomagachi pets that you can raise how you want to. They have 5 different stats, Swim, Fly, Speed, Power, and Stamina. Which stat you chose to focus on will determine the look of your chao when it evolves (I'll explain that later). YOu upgrade your chaos stats from emerald shards you get from killing enemies, and animals you find throughout the levels. You can also make your chao a Hero, Dark, or Neutral which leads to even more combinations of how your chao can look! Chaos have 2 evolutions. Their first evolution the go into a cacoon and hatch as whatever aligment they are with their focused stat before the evolution. Their second evolution is a gradual thing that happens over time after the first. You choose another stat that will change how your chao looks slightly. This leads to so amny combinations that I honestly have no clue about how many it could be.You might be asking ""why should I even raise these things."" They are cute, and you can race them in the chao races. You can also have them involved in karate if you have the DLC. Raising these cute little critters might sound really stupid and lame, but it's actually quite fun I really reccomend it.Conclusion-I would easily recommend this game to anybody who likes 3D Sonic games, Platformers, or even just for raising the chao. The only downside of this game for me is that it really hasn't aged well. I personally haven't found any glitches(except for the truck floating over me in the first level like WTF.)Overall I give this game a 9.5/10, I love this title and I hope you will to!"

While playing through the story, I spent a lot of time raising my chao, which I may or may not have become slightly obsessed over, and even after finishing the story, I still played with them, and played on multiplayer mode with a friend, which was also really fun and enjoyable.Playing the game again, now on PC, was very nostalgic, the graphics seem to remain unchanged, and the controls are rather awkward without a controller, but even when I was little, the thing that impressed me was the story, which suddenly doesn't seem as in depth, but it's still very good, specially the ability to see the whole thing from both the perspective of the good guys and the bad, taking into account each character's specific interests.The levels are very well designed, with a good mix between puzzles, action and running around being awesome, graphics are rather outdated, but the game is playable, and has a good difficulty curve.

As a child i played the game for fun and its charming atmosphere and basic gameplay made it easy to beat and enjoy, especially with the chao world. This feature lets you raise little pets, and although it doesn't seem like much, it is the best pet simulator I've experienced. It alone can stand as a game, but for people more hardcore and serious, this game is not just for a 10 year old. This game is challenging, and many call it buggy and glitchy but that is due to it's subpar camera angles. As someone who just finished getting all 180 emblems for the first time let me explain the true beauty of the game: it is universal. A true adventure game should be able to be enjoyed by all players regardless of age, and skill. This game is fun casually and super challenging if you are a serious player. It took me, after i played this game for 500 hours, in in-game time, 28 hours to beat this with 180. The game is ""big"" some will tell you but the truth is, it is about 32 levels with 5 missions each which are the same everytime (few exceptions) the first mission is beat the level, 2nd is collect rings, 3rd is find a chao, 4 is do it in a time limit, 5 is hard mode. The true challenge is balancing speed and getting points in order to get an A rank. But it is not impossible, for those who are brave enough to attempt a 180 emblem run, my hat goes out to you and if you need help add me. This game is well worth 10 dollars and on sale for 2.50 it is a no brainer, easily one of the best games ever. Side note: for those who don't like sonic games, me neither, this isn't a 2nd platformer though, it is a 3d platformer which is a lot like the difference between super mario bros 1 and super mario 64. Do not just gloss over the game because you see sonic. Thank you."

Now for my english review, this game is definetly NOT WITH OUT IMPURITY, meaning it's got quite a few glitchy, frusterating or unsatisfactory qualities, but ultimately this is one of my most favorite games in history. Sound-wise, It has AMAZING music, interesting sound effects, slightly embarrasing voice acting for some characters, and sometimes tacky dialog in some scenes. Graphically it's very vivid - I like the art style, but youcan obviously tell this is a very old game. It's physics are as unrealistic as you'd expect from any Sonic game, but it's passable.It's story is in some ways goofy (again, it's a Sonic game) but you can get very attached to the characters - more so than in most sonic games and it has an usually decent ending for a kid's game with...dramatic elements you don't normally expect. Many people hate this game because it and it's predecessor were the first time Sega tried to make Sonic into a 3D-game. Many people didn't like the switch of gameplay style, but I love this, and this right here is the only time for a very long time (until Sonic Generations) they got it (almost) perfect. Many other bad sonic games spawned from this (such as Sonic Unleashed) - but please, despite what you may have heard, give this game a chance. It may♥♥♥♥♥♥you off sometimes, it may make you laugh sometimes, but when you really get down with this, you'll cherish it.

,Recommended,213610,15194608,"Posted: 3 April, 2015",all,King Vegeta,"This is one of the better 3D Sonic games, but it's still not perfect & suffers from its own problems.Pros-Multiple Characters-Good & Bad Story Lines-Replay Value-Chao Garden-Two Player VS Mode (w/ Battle DLC)Cons-Camera Problems-Fidgety Controls-Mech MissionsCHARACTERS & GAMEPLAYSonic & Shadow the Hedgehog are the speedster levels.  You run, jump, spin & Slide your way through as fast as you can.  Pretty basic Sonic stuff right here.Knuckles & Rouge are the Gem Hunters.  You go through small open worlds in search of missing pieces of the Master Emerald w/ your Radar.  The Radar has been downgraded from the first Sonic Adventure game in that you can no longer track multiple gems at a time.  You do however get bonus points for finding the gem pieces that you're not currently tracking.  I think this is a good feature actually & it increases the difficulty just enough to keep it interesting.Tails & Eggman (Robotnik) are the mech riders.  These missions are the worst in the game.  The mechs are clunky & it always feels like you're riding on ice.  The mechs slide around as you walk which just confuses the crap out of me since they don't have any wheels.  Their missions aren't unplayable but they are annoying & can be cumbersome with how they control.  They play almost exactly like the E-101 robot from Sonic Adventure.  You shoot things & fire homing rockets at as many enemies as you can in order to rack up combo points.You can also find hidden upgrades for each character throughout certain levels.  These vary between characters & can give them essential to optional upgrades for completing the game.  If you miss an upgrade you can go back & get it via the mission select menu.The camera system still has problems.  It's good in Sonic & Shadow Stages, but the others have some issues.  Especially in Knuckles & Rouge stages.  The gem hunting stages you need to explore to find gems but the camera is set up in such a way where it will fight you tooth & nail.  It puts itself in awkard positions which is especially difficult in tight areas.  It tries to follow you in larger areas, but ends up getting stuck behind objects or walls.  You can move it left/right but not up/down so if you really wanna look in a certain direction you're SOL.  The camera was obviously designed for the Dreamcast & it's limited controller but still, they could have touched it up by now.  It's still lightyears better than the previous Sonic Adventure's camera at least.STORY (SPOILERS)The story revolves around Sonic being mistaken as Shadow & the Army is now hunting him down.  Shadow is released from a TOP SECRET Military Base on some island somewhere by Eggman.  Rouge is sent to spy on them while fulfilling her own needs stealing gems.  When she comes accross the master emerald & fails to steal it from Knuckles he shatters it into pieces that scatter accross the world (for some reason) in order to keep it from being stolen.  Now they're both out to collect all the pieces before the other.  Eggman takes control of some super destroyer satalite & holds the world hostage while Tails is in mostly just a support role for the story in that he helps Sonic stop Eggman.  It pretty much ends with two Super Hedgehogs saving the world from a sentient bio-weapon created by Eggman's grandfather.GRAPHICSThe graphics haven't aged well.  Character models & environments are blocky just like they were on the DC/GCN.  Textures have been upgraded for higher resolutions at least.  The game supports 1080p & runs smoothly.  I hear there are lots of glitches when running on Windows 8.1 so you may need to set compatibility down to Windows 7 if you experience any issues.AUDIOMusic is good albeit cheesy & catchy at the same time.  I played this game as a kid & I still have that ""Follow my Rainbow"" song stuck in my head.  The voice acting is pretty bad.  The lines are set up for japanese dialog so in english everyone just talks over eachother in certain parts of the story.  You have to pay close attention to understand what the hell is going on sometimes.  The game uses most of the same sound effects from the previous Sonic Adventure game as well, which isn't a bad thing.CONTROLSI found the controls vary depending on what controller you're using.  I was first using a Logitech F310 controller but omg was that thing terrible to play this game with.  I ended up switching to my old Dual Pro controller, but you need to use x360ce to get that to work properly.  The Dual Pro controller works a lot better, since this game was built originally for older controllers the super sensitive sticks nowadays don't work well with it.  I advise to either use an older controller or set up your newer analog sticks with less sensitive settings for it to work properly.The game can also be played with the keyboard but I wouldn't recommend it.  It's even clunkier with that than it is with a normal controller.CHAO GARDENThe Chao Garden is probably where you'll spend most of your time in this game.  It's pretty much tamagachis in Sonic.  Much improved as well from the Chao Garden in the first Sonic Adventure.  The only downside is that the mini Chao Garden no longer works.  It was used in the Gamecube/GBA link where your GBA would download a mini garden from the Gamecube & you could raise your Chao with you on the go.  It was a fun little side game that was good if you liked raising your chao.Here you raise Chaos to be Good or Evil depending on which character you use to raise it.  I recommend doing both since you unlock Light/Dark Chao gardens for raising at least one of each.  You also get a shop to buy your Chao gifts & even buy rare Chao eggs.  It's probably the most addictive part of the game & it's actually the reason why I bought this port.  :)BATTLE DLCThe Battle DLC nets you a bonus 2-player VS mode where you can race or fight eachother.  There is no online play, though.  It's all local.  It's a fun distraction if you've got a friend over.  There are also mods that let you play as the Characters used here in the regular missions but you need the DLC for it to work.The best part of the Battle DLC is that you get extra things for the Chao Garden.  It also changes the graphics to look like the GCN version.OVERALLThere are good & bad Sonic games.  This one is still a far better game than the 1st Sonic Adventure, yet it still has flaws that keep it from greatness.  I recommend it for Sonic Fans or anyone who wants to experience an older 3D Sonic game that isn't terrible like it's predecessor.The most fun part is probably the Chao Garden.  It's a very addictive little pet simulator.  If anything I'd recommend buying this game just for that alone."

The highlight of his game has to be the chao world. It adds so many hours onto the game and is actually a necessary process if you are going for 100%. If you do aim to 100% complete this game though (as im sure many people have by now) its extreemly tedious! Getting the best rank in every stage is very difficult and you require excellent gameplay skills to finish this game fully! I probably will just play this game through normally as getting a perfect score on every stage is too tedious for my taste..To finish every level normally however, its great to play even though some stages do have a few glitches here and there. Ive experianced a glitch when playing the games first level, where a texture of a truck is glitching onto the screen blocking my view so its very hard to see where im going! I wish the game was more optimised for newer operating systems and was tested a bit better before release.. Then again its a older game so you cant expect much at this stage!I will warn anyone thats planning to buy this game though, do NOT BUY THIS unless you have some form of controller. Seriously playing this game using keyboard controls feels so awkward and almost makes the game unplayable. Some people however do like playing using the keyboard, but for the best experiance, i would recommend a controller.I also had problems getting the game to launch first time, with files being missing from my computer. I have fixed this issue after reinstalling the game like twice and looking up solutions online. Overall great game, i just dont recommend playing this without a controller."

Obviously I have to admit this game has flaws but nothing major, just some typical camera angle issues from the dreamcast era and some pacing issues with shooting and treasure hunting segments.This is a great game and there is a lot of replay value and content to find within which is a shame because sonic team these days rarely does this anymore. You have multiple gameplay types, the chao gardens, unlockable content, missions, menu themes, multiplayer(That has characters and not sonic recolors) and even a kart racing mini game.As for the story yeah theres plot holes but it doesn't ruin anything and for a plot it was pretty good, cheesy in parts but good and really bold for a kids game. I've always been in the camp that miss the more serious content or at least having balance rather than the grimdark shadow game or the sitcom humor of the post colors era.On music, well this game was pretty much the highlight and crush 40 is just awesome(Kind of miss the epic tracks the series used to have)If you like sonic this is a must have game and yeah edgy youtube reviewers and loud Lets play types will tear this game a part because hating the sonic series and fandom is the internet cool thing to do but go into this without any bias and make up your own mind."
76561198044770180,Recommended,213610,31692377,Posted: 11 May,all,"I'm Mr Meeseeks, Look at Me!","Sonic Adventure 2 is truly a fantastic game. The Sonic/Shadow stages are some of the best stages I've ever played in a 3D platformer, with near-perfect control and fantastic level design that flows beautifully. The movement is easy to learn but hard to master with many subtle complexities, and the variety of moves Sonic has, such as rail-grinding and light speed dashes, only enhance the enjoyable movement. There isn't a single one of these stages that I don't like. The Tails/Robotnik stages and the Knuckles/Rouge stages may not be as good as the speed stages, and have a few duds, but they're still a lot of fun and add variety to the game while still remaining a fast-paced platformer at its core. The fact that playstyles alternate during both stories helps eliminate fatigue of playing one playstyle for too long, and the fact that each character gets their own stages for a total of 31 unique levels makes the game's story mode sufficiently long without being padded or suffering from repetition.The story itself is a lot of fun, with good pacing, memorable set pieces, fantastic characterization and solid animation for the time. Some aspects of the presentation are dated, but the game's story is still a ton of fun with many memorable moments of both cheesy hilarity, such as the infamous ""faker"" cutscene, and genuinely great storytelling, such as Shadow's backstory and character development.On top of the already sufficiently lengthy story mode, Sonic Adventure 2 contains an absurd amount of replay value for a platformer, with 5 optional missions, a ranking system, and stages that are inherently designed around repeat playthroughs in exceedingly clever ways. The existence of the Chao Garden, a game-within-a-game that provides a slower-paced alternative to the fast-paced main game, while managing to be just as deep and enjoyable as said main game, is icing on the cake.In addition to the excellent gameplay, Sonic Adventure 2 sports an excellent presentation. The game's graphics are excellent for a Dreamcast title and still look good today, and the art design is solid, if a little lacking in color variety. Additionally, the music is beyond stellar, offering different musical styles for each character that give the soundtrack great variety while also adding to the already great characterization of the story. The compositions are high-energy and memorable, perfectly fitting the levels while also making for great listening outside of the game itself. The instrumentation combines good variety with downright ♥♥♥♥♥♥ic use of the electric guitar, especially in the titular theme of the game, Live and Learn. Music is naturally a subjective medium, but you'd be hard-pressed to find a person who can't jam out to at least one track from this title, and if you're anything like me, you can jam out to nearly all of them. Technical polish is admittedly one of the weaker aspects of the game, with a few glitches being present and a handful of wonky moments that can disrupt the play experience, but when everything else is as good as it is, it’s easy to forgive the few technical hiccups that exist.Overall, Sonic Adventure 2 is a downright phenomenal 3D platformer that I find to be just as fun now, if not more fun, then when I first played it as a kid in the early 2000s. It’s a game that I can pick up and play no matter what mood I’m in, and it almost never fails to leave me with an ear-to-ear grin. It’s a game that fills me with the kind of childlike wonder and joy that I haven’t felt since I got Super Mario Galaxy in Christmas 2007, and those kinds of games are very hard to come by. Sonic Adventure 2 comes highly recommended for any fan of Sonic the Hedgehog or 3D platformers in general.Score: 10/10"

The level deisgn usually doesn't give me major issues with some exceptions and unfortunately a good bit of the treasure hunting levels.Furthermore on those, sometimes they can be a bit of a pain to accomplish with the emerald shards being in places that make them hard to reach due to obstacles that can include enemies, spikes or even the controls and camera. There can also be glitches that get you killed unfairly or make things annoying.Still, there can be plenty of fun to have and a lot of goals to try and accomplish for emblems if you so please.I will happily admit that the main reason I got this game and plan to get the DLC as I write this is for the Chao Garden; I adore it. There is so much variety! The Chao can have so many different combinations of looks, many different skills and abilities, stats etc. They're also adorable and something I personally love to raise.If you are OK handling some bits of odd controls that can go badly with glitches in exchange for a good amount of fun than feel free to get this!

Many believed that Ohtani was far better than this and sent out to dig deeper into the previous entries to derive the true meaning of Find Myself.The biggest clue was when Ohtani mentioned that he had made a major revision to Find Myself upon learning that it would become a credits stage. Now why would that be? Ohtani had, up to now, made no concessions for Sega’s bull♥♥♥♥♥♥ He had kept true to his story and refused to let his superior get in the way of telling it.And that’s just it, it wasn’t in the way at all. In fact, it was just what he needed.The credits themselves would be the multiple personalities of Knuckles, the friends he had come to love and cherish over the years he spent with them, slowly disappearing from him as he slipped more and more back into reality as he cruised down the mountain. Knuckles would never face the camera, he would never look back until the game was over. There, in fact, most likely were NEVER to be any lyrics, an eerie silence juxtaposed next to nearly two hours of nonstop monologue.The game would end with a cut to black and complete silence as the Sonic Team logo came up for one last time and simply hung there, waiting for the player to provide input for the game to continue.The player themselves would have to cast away Sonic, not only a character that gamers around the world have known and loved for decades, but also the last and only true friend Knuckles had ever had, even if he was imaginary.The player themselves would have to pull the final plug on Knuckles’s warped reality and finally set him free."

Sonic Adventure 2 was the second game to feature modern Sonic's style and persona.Sonic Adventure 2 is less comical and a bit more gritty than the modern-day Sonic game, where Dr. Eggman for once isn't the true antagonist. Is that bad thing? No it isn't, in fact, I like it better when the storylines were like this. Shadow and Rouge were also introduced, as much as how Shadow is now represented with ""haha i'm better than you"" kind of feel, this game provided him with a backstory that now feels completely ignored. Not to mention when you unlock the Last Story, this game makes a dramatic turn, I knew when I unlocked it as a kid, I was in for something.Sonic's reputation is plummeting, though I feel if SEGA were to look back at this game, they could make a recovery with good execution. This game's only issue for me is the bad camera angles, and the english dub dialogue always cuts other dialogue off in cutscenes. Other than that, this game eternally represents my childhood."

That is because when you run it it first starts a launcher, and that is where you enable the controller. Start the executable directly after doing so, though, and the controller works fine in-game without needing to access the launcher again. Just make sure your controller is on if it's a wireless controller before you start the game. Press the Xbox button in the center of your controller after starting the game and you should be greeted with the Steam overlay (Big Picture) or the Game Bar (Windows 10), which means the game has detected your controller. If the game does not accept your controller inputs, then it did not detect your controller and you must start the game again in order to redetect it.This is one game that I always wanted. You have no idea how hard it was to set up a Dreamcast emulator or a GameCube emulator just to play this game.

If you're not one of these people, I probably wouldn't pick up this game. It's not a traditional Sonic game. There's 6 different playable characters and two of them do Sonic based levels (Sonic/Shadow). This turns most people off who've never played the game (based off of what I've seen in the reviews anyway). Go look up some gameplay of Tails/Eggman/Rouge/Knuckles in this game if you're still interested though.That being said, let me just clarify some things for those old players.- The port is a piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥ I actually bought this game quite a while ago and wasn't able to play it at all, regardless of what I did. I later built a new computer (not just for this game of course) along with a new monitor. That monitor actually ended up causing me some issues. If you have a 144hz monitor the game is going to run at double speed. It took me a while to figure out why the game was doing this and I couldn't find any solutions online. Turns out all you have to do is change your monitor to 60hz. The game flat out just won't play on fullscreen, and I wouldn't stand for windowed. So I got Borderless Gaming (Steam application) which basically allows you to play games on borderless window regardleses of their settings. There are free versions of this program, but anyways that's what I had to put up with just to get the game to play. I also get a 1 second stutter roughly every 5 minutes. I've got no idea why this is, but it doesn't really matter anymore since I almost have all the achievements anyway.Despite my (and many others) experience with the horrible port this shouldn't discourage you. There's a refund feature on Steam that not everyone knows about. Here's some information about it:http://store.steampowered.com/steam_refunds/If the game doesn't run well for you (which believe me there's a good chance it won't) then simply refund.- The game seems to be ported from the Dreamcast version, meaning the easter eggs that were (previously) only on Dreamcast can be found on here too.- If you want to get all of the achievements you >must< get the DLC."

Also, there are a few odd bugs that seem to be system specific. Some get in the way quite a bit (having half of the screen sometimes covered by a levitating truck in city escape when I run the game on integrated graphics being one).Performance is very good with the exclusion of a few massive slowdowns I have experienced in time trial, however these slowdowns were only experienced when  was running integrated graphics. Oh, and I'm running my integrated because thanks to the game's awful launcher system, it's slightly difficult to run it on my dedicated graphics (I'm on a laptop).My review of the game in general aside from port differences: It's a very buggy sonic game that you must learn the kinks of to enjoy, the story isn't great, they removed the overworld segment from adventure 1 (this is a good thing), but they have more varying gameplay types (of which my favorite is the treasure hunting).  Bosses are hit-and-miss, and this game is mostly held together by nostalgia.... and chaoYes, as a side project they decided to involve a chao raising minigame, and it carries the rest of the product. I bought this simply because I wanted to raise chao again. The chao make the in-game levels more fun to explore and learn about and give the actual game a purpose to replay (for the ring count and items to give to chao). Emblems(tokens of advancement in the game) unlock new things in the chao garden. I want everything for my chao.OG REVIEW: A port from the Xbox and Playstation version (evident from Big the Cat everywhere). There is not a way to get a gold or silver chao.

,Recommended,213610,18256782,"Posted: 29 September, 2015",all,BONKERS,"A great game that has held up to the test of time.But a good port with unresolved issues that Sega has never patchedRecommended Readinghttp://pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Sonic_Adventure_2I LOVE SA2, I was obsessed with this game back when it came out on the DC and later the GCN. My friends and my brother and I all played this endlessly together. It's not perfect, but is a testament and standard to how 3D Sonic games should all be designed.As imperfections are present in the game, so too are they in the port itself. It's just shy of being great.ProsRetains the 60FPS performance profile of the original gamesSupports arbitrary resolutions of varying aspect ratios. (Multimon setups require Flawless Widescreen FlawlessWidscreen*dot*org)All gameplay and some cutscenes now support native HOR+ Widescreen (Remaining Cutscenes are 4:3UI and many textures have been updated and look very cleanFull Controller and Keyboard support with a switch in the launcher for both.Supports Controller and Keyboard IconsSupports different Keyboard layout standards. AZERTY,QWERTY,etcFull Remapping of all buttons and keysStill supports local MP and content from the GCN Battle releasePerforms flawlessly when it works for you_________________________________________________________ConsGame logic is tied to 60FPS. This means if you drop under 60FPS (Would take a low end machine to do so) the game slows down rather than dropping frames. It also means if you have a Variable Refresh Rate Monitor or a High Refresh Rate Monitor, the game will be sped up over 60FPS.So these users *NEED* to set their monitor to a 60hz RR when playing the game. A simple Framerate cap will not suffice because...The Steam Overlay, Riva Tuner Statistic Service OSD (From MSI Afterburner), and external Framerate limiters (RTSS,DXTory,GeDoSaTo,etc) will cause the game to crash after the Sonic Team logo appears. (You need to disable the Steam Overlay and add ""Sonic2app.exe"" to RTSS and set the ""Application Detection Level"" to ""None"" )When this happens, you have to Crtl+Alt+Del to open Task manager and kill the .EXE. Because...Game does not support Alt+F4 to quit. So you have to Alt-Tab out, or go through the tedious menus in game to quit.Creating a game profile for Sonic Adventure 2 in Nvidia Control Panel or Nvidia Inspector and enabling FXAA will ALSO cause the game to crash at the Sonic Team LogoGame does not support any kind of Anti Aliasing on it's own. See below section about AA.The ""Battle"" content from the GCN release is tied behind a DLC Paywall.The launcher always opens with the game. You can bypass it by following the guide ""Bypass Launcher"" under ""Essential improvments"" in the linked page at the top.For some people the game will not launch unless in windowed mode. I myself have never had this problem. YMMV.No Texture Filtering setting.The Sound Effects are INSANELY loud and painful to listen to. Overall the Audio balance is extremely poor, which is something that is carried over from the original releases I think. Something they SHOULD have fixed in this release or at the very damn least, put in Volume Sliders.Currently the only way to fix it is to extract and modify the sounds of the game directly. Which can be tricky for some.Luckily someone put together a file with all the sound effects lowered by 50%!=Download this archive={LINK REMOVED}https://mega.nz/#!MFQwlYJS!fwOdyFTe5JFm9z0ENmFFFjkLT0R7DoYBDkSBBUP9FNs=navigate <path-to-game> ""resource\gd_PC"". =Replace the folder ""MLT"" with the one from the archive.______________________________________________________________Now, it seems like the Cons are much larger than the Pros. So one would assume the recommendation would be ""NO"".But to the contrary, most of them are easily solvable (Now that is) and it doesn't affect enjoyment of the game once you get it up and running and deal with some of the small unavoidable quirks.____________________________________________________________________________Tweaks For Nvidia UsersIt is highly recommended you use Nvidia Inspector for Nvidia Users. As it allows greater control on a per profile basis than NVCP. Allows more options to be changed and is FAR more responsive than the sluggish NVCP.Nvidia Inspector setup guideDownload the latest version herehttp://www.guru3d.com/files-details/nvidia-inspector-download.html- In the future if the application needs to update. It will tell you so and automatically download any updates.Save it to a location that you can permanently use. Extract it.When you open it for the first time you will be presented withhttp://u.cubeupload.com/MrBonk/InspectorMainScreen.pngClick the Tool icon next to the ""Driver Version"" Box to open up the driver profile settings.You are now greeted with this screen and the default ""Global Home"" Profilehttp://u.cubeupload.com/MrBonk/Inspectorbasicexplan.png(You will want to create a desktop shortcut as noted)These are the settings that globally apply to ANY given application. It is VERY IMPORTANT that you minimize what you force Globally to only basic things such as Texture Filtering settings and Performance Mode.Here is my Global profile, I suggest you match it  (Remember to hit ""Apply Changes"" afterward)and change nothing else.http://u.cubeupload.com/MrBonk/GlobalProfile.jpgSonic Adventure 2 does not have a profile in the Nvidia Drivers by DefaultFollowing the notes on this picturehttp://u.cubeupload.com/MrBonk/Inspectorbasicexplan.pngCreate a new profile named ""Sonic Adventure 2""You are now ready to tweak Anti-Aliasing and HBAO+*If you matched my Global Profile settings, you will not need to change any Texture Filtering settings. As the new Profile will match the global setting by default of HQ 16xAFSonic Adventure 2 does not require a special Hexidecimal Flag in order to force Anti Aliasing.It supports forcing of essentially all AA modes.MSAA,TrSSAA (Transparency SuperSampling),SGSSAA (Sparse Grid SuperSampling), OGSSAA (Shown as ""YxY Supersampling"" modes.Ordered Grid Super Sampling.) and HSAA (Hybrid-Sampling. Which is a combination of MSAA,OGSSAA,TrSSAA and SGSSAA)My recommendation if you have a decent GPU is to use ""16xS [Combined: 2x2 SS + 4x MS]"". This is IMO the best performance/quality ratio option. It's not perfect, but the average user won't notice the remaining issues.To see references and how to apply AA settings in Nvidia Inspector see this guide here (That I am the maintainer of)http://forums.guru3d.com/showthread.php?t=357956For HBAO+ there are two working flags - 0x00000012 (Subtle) and 0x00000013 (Strong)Both have some minor bleeding, but add quite a bit of depth.To see references and how to apply HBAO+ in Nvidia Inspector follow my guide with images herehttp://forums.guru3d.com/showthread.php?t=387114"

,Not Recommended,213610,33760455,Posted: 24 July,all,yung crystal pepsi,"Poorly aged, and massively overrated. The Sonic/Shadow stages, while mostly enjoyable, still have some cracks that become more obvious with age. Some of them are really fun (City Escape will never not be a classic) but others, like Crazy Gadget, are obnoxious and grating. Sonic and Shadow's touchy movement controls make these stages and the boss fights an exercise in patience, especially with that awful camera.Tails/Eggman are just okay; blowing up a bunch of stuff in a huge combo is satisfying as all hell, but it takes zero effort to do so, and the cookie-cutter enemy placement doesn't help much. They're brainless and boring.But the creme de la crap comes in the form of Knuckles and Rouge's stages. Exploration and treasure hunting don't belong in a Sonic game. At all. The openness of the stages combined with the randomized nature of the emerald pieces adds the challenge here, and I can understand why they did it that way, I really can. If everything was in the same place every time you played, there would be no challenge. But even so, these stages are still a slog, even with the hints. The emerald radar only works with one piece at a time, so you're forced to go searching in the order the game wants you to. The controls in these stages are also really touchy- Knuckles and Rouge don't need speed here, so why is it that they can move almost as fast as Sonic and Shadow once they've built up enough momentum? Combat is also awful in these stages- just glide into your enemies, because your combo attack is useless and twitchy.So what's left in a game that's only 1/3 good? A laughably awful story that reads like a 13 year-old's fanfiction, with acting that sounds like it was done by said 13 year-old and his classmates in a school play. This is a game about talking animals with superhuman abilities, but the story takes itself way too seriously to be enjoyable.The only things worth salvaging about this game are the cheesy awesome soundtrack and the surprisingly enjoyable Chao Garden sidequest, which you could easily sink more hours into than the actual game as long as you only grind for animals and chao drives in the stages you enjoy playing. All in all, though, Sonic Adventure 2 is a mess of a game that tries to be as variety-filled as a Take 5 bar, but instead comes off feeling like a pizza with every single topping imaginable on it, drowning out that zesty pepperoni."

,Recommended,213610,8064954,"Posted: 16 December, 2013",all,redeem4,"If your looking for a really unique action-adventure game with a blending of different types of gameplay styles well look no further. Sonic Adventure 2 expands upon the original Sonic Adventure, adding bigger levels (although sadly no more open world), more upgrades to find, more characters to play with, a tamogachi inspired Chao raising garden, Kart races, and even a 2 player racing and battle mode if your inclined to take part in.If all of this sounds too good to be true, well you should be happy to know that won't be disappointed as long as your expecting a game that by all accounts isn't perfect, but its just so unique and has that Sega Dreamcast era charm and personality that it might as well be and you definitely be hard pressed to find similar games to it even to this day.Now lets get down to all this varied gameplay I was talking about earlier, in this game there are specifically 3 different types of gameplay styles which include Sonic/Shadow which their levels are all about going fast, bouncing on enemies, and is generally the type of gameplay you would expect from a Sonic game. You then have Knuckles/Rogue levels where they have to have find Chaos Emeralds shards or keys in a level by listening to a radar to see if they are close and then either straight out picking it up or digging in the ground for it or even just killing an enemy. Last, but not least is the Tails/Robotnik levels which are essentially updated Gamma levels from Sonic Adventure 1 where you will go through a level locking on and shooting lots of enemies while trying to get to the end. It's also worth mentioning that going through story mode you will also sometimes come across the usual boss fights and even the occassional racing mini-game to add even more to the mix.Now to the part where about half of you will love and the other will hate and thats the Chao Garden. You see, throughout each level in the game, you pick up these colored objects and even small animals that you can take back to the garden and feed to your chao to make it level up in a certain attribute which you can take to compete in races or even battle it out karate style! They also evolve and change depending on how you grow them and there are some secrets even to be had with them. The part however that some people do not like with this big part of the game is that it is essential to raise a chao to have high stats and do all the races/battles so that you can get 100% completion which unlocks a special level and raising chao is not a fast endeavor.All in all, the game itself is great. The port however...has a few kinks to work out with getting it to work with Fullscreen mode now with a new patch, but is semi-easily fixed, so if you can get it working then you should have a great time with the game and this game will take you quite a while as well if you try to get all the Emblems and A-Ranks as well, so there's that, but if you just try and finish the story mode by itself with some or little chao raising then your looking at a solid 10 hour game."

,Recommended,213610,11701869,"Posted: 14 August, 2014",all,GrilledCheese,"If you played this game when you were younger and you're ready for a good dose of nostalgia, buy this game. However, if you've never played this game before, this may or may not be worth your time.I'm recommending this because, out of all the Sonic games that have been released within the last decade-and-a-half, this is still my favorite. Yes, I can attribute some of that to the nostalgic value that I'm placing on it, but it's really quite a good game in terms of gameplay. Is it the perfect Sonic title? No. Not by a long shot. But it's still fun.You have 3 styles of gameplay in this title. First and foremost are your ""Speed"" levels, which you have to get through the level as fast as possible. This is the most classic gameplay of a Sonic game that many fans are familiar with. You play these levels with either Sonic or Shadow. Then you have your 3rd-person shooter levels. I feel like these levels are the most taxing and least fun in the game, but the goal is to shoot everything in your path and reach the end of the level. You play these levels with either Tails or Dr. Eggman. Lastly, we have the ""treasure hunt"" style of levels, which are actually pretty fun if you explore a little. You have to search for the pieces of the Master Emerald in these settings, and these are played by either Knuckles or Rouge.The premise of the Chao Garden is to raise your own Chao by giving it animals and chaos drives to increase it's abilities, and effectively make it stronger to participate in Chao Karate and in races. Also, you get to sorta act like a parent to these things, so it's a pretty neat and fun side activity to do while reaching high scores on all of the levels in the games.In the end, it's quite a fascinating game. The total story time amounts to maybe 4 hours if you know what you're doing and where to go, 6-7 if you're new to the game. But with all of the kart racing, chao raising, and different quests in the levels, you can keep playing the game for hours and hours and still not have done everything there is to do. If you're not a Sonic fan or didn't play this game in your childhood, then it's not for you. However, if you haven't played the game before and you enjoy Sonic games every once in awhile, this is a great title to play, and I highly recommend it."

There were a lot of opportunities for improvements that they missed. Also wish they had at least expanded the gardens so that we could have more than eight Chao. That aside, I definitely recommend this game. If you don't raise at least one Chao in your lifetime you're missing out."

The goal is to go through levels at a slower speed shooting all the enemies. Last and least is the treasure hunting stages. In these satges you play as Knuckles/Rouge to find the shards of the Master Emerald. The gameplay in these stages are very slow and boring. You will go around for minutes trying to find 1 shard. These are the most hated sections of this game. There is also a feature called the Chao Garden. In the Chao Garden you raise chao in 5 stats Flying, Speed, Power, Swimming, and Stamina. These stats help you compete in Chao Races and Chao Karate. This mode can be very complicated and you can spend hours raising chao.

There is a very meaty challenege for anyone trying to 100% the game. I did it on PS3 and PC. I really enjoyed it.Gameplay can be broken down into 4 parts:Speed: You're Sonic/Shadow you run through levels. The best part of the game.Shooting: Tails/Eggman are in mechs and you have a lock on lazer cannon the idea of each stage being how many enemies you can target at once before losing the lock, pretty neat once you get into it.Treasure Hunting: Knuckles/Rouge fly around contained levels looking for 3 of something. You can climb, glide, dig, it's fun to just run around as them really.There's also a few mods out that are pretty great and I highly recommend hitting up Sonic Retro for them.Now for a controversial opinion: Chao Garden sucks.A lot of people will try to tell you the chao portion is something special. It was easily the poorest portion of the game by far. It's tedious, it's annoying, it's not deep or interesting it's a time waster through and through.Essentially all the enemies in the game drop animals or energy cores that you can give to the chao leveling them up so they can better race or fight. The racing and fighting however are slow paced affairs you have no impact on other than cheering. It's just there to pad out the game time because you need to do all the races and karate to 100% the game. I would recommend cheating on the chao part because it's a waste of time.In short: Mechanically solid game with an excellent aesthetic, it has a tacked on time waster you need to complete in order to 100% the game but you can ignore it if you don't care about that."

It's a questionable port of an already questionable port of a game MARRED by plenty of archaic design choices and technical issues. And of course, that's not even bringing mention to the stiff, albeit functional controls, terrible presentation, and a camera that was designed around a controller that lacked a second analogue stick, which essentially boils down to it sucking, despite the new jerky camera control implemented into this version of the game.As for the sound design, this port somehow makes the already terrible sound mixing of the original version of the game, as well as the GCN port, even WORSE! You know a port of a game is bad when distant explosions and off-screen seagulls drown out the game's background music!Oh, and did I mention the DRM? Yes, you've read that correctly.

Whether you're a Sonic fan, a fan of the ""Dreamcast Era"" Sonic games, or just a plain gamer, be you hardcore or casual, there's nothing in here that justifies purchasing this lazy port of a game almost 2 decades old.

That means no more emulating or messing up with tv cables just for plugging in my GC to play some SA2.Nothing has changed, basically it's the exact same game I got used to with an extra interview, slightly changed menu for achievements, leaderboards, not to mention the fixed cutscenes. I was expecting a tiny bit more extra stuff for the PC version considering the plus dev time it needed (probably for fixing some minor issues, not because they wanted to add any more content to it). The game is running slow when many things are on the screen at once (just like Sonic '06 XD), but it's totally okay when I'm aiming for an A rank to get, so in the long run it's good to have that slowdown at a few parts.This Epic Resurrection makes me wonder if we can expect more awesomeness to come...like a Sonic Heroes and a Shadow The Hedgehog re-release.And....who knows?

I am a Sonic fan, but I know bad games when I see one, unfortunately this is one of those cases. SA2 is not terrible, but for all its strengths in great level design, it lets it down in almost every aspect.For one is the presentation, the narrative this game follows is so convoluted in its Sci-Fi BS, I was truly baffled if it was actually trying to appeal to children. There's a failed science experiment known as the ultimate life form Shadow the Hedgehog, whose creator, Robotnik's Grandfather turned insane afterthe government killed his niece and sentenced him to death, for creating a space colony, which after, as revenge towards the government and all of humanity, turned the Space colony into a literal meteor to destroy the world, after the coveted Chaos Emeralds are inserted, which Robotnik eventually does. I'm a grown lad, but this story is (pardon my use of the word) cringy, and the voice acting is almost just as bad (""Let's GET to WOOORK!""). I know many people love the soundtrack to this game, mostly done by Crush 40, but I am a rare exception where I can't stand these over the top 80's rock tunes. It also doesn't help that in most cutscenes the music drowns out the sound of the actors, and even the voice lines overlap most of the time (""You're not even good enough to be my fa---"" ""I'll make you eat those Words!!"").Now onto the actual meat of the game. SA2 is split into three segments, not including those out of place kart-racing sequences. There's an actual Sonic the Hedgehog game with Sonic and Shadow, an INCREDIBLY shallow shooting mech game with awful clunky controls with Robotnik and Tails (Can't Tails just Fly?), and a Hotter/Colder styled Treasure hunt levels with Knuckles and Rouge. The levels with Sonic and Shadow are by far the best parts of the game, they're what you come to expect with a Sonic game. You run fast, collect rings, jump on robots, and play around with the levels' many gimmicks. The controls are just about perfect, it's not too slippery, yet not overly precise, plus your speed changes depending on an incline, giving it a realistic feel. This is all that I wanted fromt this game, but like Sonic Team always does, they take a Sonic game and put a bunch of other play styles that don't cohese with the fast gameplay. First up is the Robotnik/Tails levels. You do some very light platforming with this game's crappy camera, and clunky controls. But usually you walk down hallways of little excitement and lock on to multiple enemies with your laser by holding B and fire all the locked on enemies when you let go of the button. The more enemies you rack up in a single fire the higher combo you get. That's all there is to it, it's fun once you start, but given how this makes up 1/3 of the entire game, there needed to be more to it, more enemy types, more weapons or gadgets to equip, but all you get is a hover ability. The enemies don't put up much of a challenge except for Artificial Chaos who clipping through the door with its stretchy arms, or blocking your attacks as soon as your fire. In other words, it's not fun. Lastly there's the Treasure hunting sections, where you glide and climb around with good control in all honesty, and use the beeping, color-changing, radar on the bottom to help locate the three pieces of the emerald in the level. The problem is the radar only beeps for an emerald one at a time, so you can essentially walk past the emerald multiple times and not know its there until the game decides it has padded out the time long enough to tell you. The other key problem comes from the levels themselves. The levels are closed off and are typically pretty labryinthine, and large. Sure climbing and gliding eases the pain, but you still go through segments of an area that may not stick out to you, so can basically loop in the same area over and over again. The ""hints"" are incredibly vague and only appear three times before they disappear.None of the core gameplay elements ever work, except for the Sonic and Shadow levels, which is really all that I signed up for. The problem with that is, that in order to play all their levels, I have to play the other two styles to get there. The other parts of the game are the Chao raising which, granted is actually quite good, or the multiplayer, which, again is a neat time-sinker. But these fun distractions don't distract from the fact that SA2 does not offer enough in core gameplay for me to come back to this game as opposed to any other Sonic game. Don't play this unless you're hardcore Sonic fan, who for some reason doesn't already have this game. If your're new to the series play the OG trilogy or Generations, or Mania, when that eventually comes out."

Additionally, this port requires oddly high specs to run at full speed, especially when Sonic Adventure DX could be played on most basic machines."

I have no idea why I 100% completed this game on the gamecube. did I really have fun with this broken game?The first hero level (sonic) works well enough but as the game progresses the levels become less well designed, clashing with the very poor camera control - and unavoidable pitfalls and enemy placement in many of the levels. The story is a complete mess. there is some inconsistencies to some characters movements like light ring, homing attack detection and rail controls.The weird chao mini-game is suprisingly more complex then I remember; but it requires a lot of farming for chaos drives animals and rings - which doesn't do much to break the monotony of the game and I honestly could play a better game.The port itself is okay I guess it works without issue and provides a decent graphical upgrade to the game, (though dolphin emulation can pull of far more better stuff IMO. It doesn't fix the bad technical issues though like the sound and character animation.

But the nice gameplay and story make up for that. The Chao Garden is finally back and luckily didn't change at all, making the game be so much more addicting.The game runs pretty smooth on a simple Laptop, making it way better than emulating it (Althrough you can't sprint through City Escape with Eggman anymore via Action Replay...)As a title originally releashed in the early 2000's. Comparing the graphics with other titles like Sonic Generations isn't the best idea. But the game will always simplify the character model whenever you get to far from the camera or in Multiplayer. Making the game SO ugly at times.The 3 unique ways to play is a step back from the prequel's 6. But without the annoying fishing stages, this is not bad at all. The Sonic and Shadow stages are the typical 'Reach the goal' levels. While Tails and Eggman get the Mech levels originating from Sonic Adventure's E101 Gamma's stages. Knuckles and Rouge hold the treasure hunt levels, which are way more interesting now with every stage holding something special.Overall, I totally recommend this game for true Sonic fans and 3D platforming gamers."

The plot is a little bit janky at times, and the cutscenes could use a lot of work (oh god... the lip-syncing), but the core gameplay is still very enjoyable. There are a few different game modes as well, so the gameplay tends to remain interesting and avoid repetitiveness.However, the one part of this game that always brings me back is the Chao Garden. Chao are small, cute creatures you can raise as sort of a side-game, but the garden has ahugeamount of depth to it. You can raise and take care of them, enroll them in kindergarten, give them toys to play with, put them in races, they can interact with each other on their own accord, play instruments in bands, and the list goes on. You can raise them to be good or evil, and their appearance and personality will be reflected by it.If SA2B was a staple of your childhood, then by all means pick it up; it's the exact same game you know and love. If you haven't experienced it before, I would still recommend it (if not just for the Chao Garden), but just be aware that it's far from perfect."

I spent hours on this game as a kid, and a little older the game still comes across as amazing! If you want to experiance one of the markets best games (one of my most favourite so its mostly my opinion) then definately buy this game. If I have one or two criticisms about the game's port, is the fact that the sound is butchered horribly, Sound FX often plays over and hiding character dialouge (not much but still very annoying) and one of the most kickass soundtracks ever, and two, is the fact that unless you have a gamepad (Any controller that can be used on games on steam) you can have a bad time with the controls, e.g in one of Tail's stages where you have to make a pinpoint acurate shot at 4 bombs to open a door while hovering, this caused me more game overs than I care to admit.

It got so bad that I was shaking with rage, it was only made worse by the fact I had one more hit to get and I died. The whole time my partner was behind me trying not to laugh as I kept screaming ""USELESS ****, STOP TURNING, OMG STOP IT"" Thankfully I did manage to kill the golem in the end but I was shaking that much that I had to end it there.Do not play this game unless you have a controller, you might just kill someone.The graphics are really bad, but it is an old game.The script is hilarious, Rouge and Knuckles have some of the worst lines in this game. Their flirting is horrific.However this game is great, I enjoyed it as a kid and I do enjoy it now (When I'm not raging over having to use keys)"

,Recommended,213610,9089451,"Posted: 13 February, 2014",all,Jearbear,"For an old game, it is extremely amazing. It has some good levels, but unfortunatly we have tails's levels to make the game bad. This is not as much of a worry however, as there are maybe 5-6 tails levels. Eggman plays like tails, just his levels are great. Sonic's levels are pretty boring other than city escape, while shadow only has 4 stages, 3 of which are fun to replay. White jungle is in my top 2 best sonic levels of all time. The knuckles and rogue levels can be long if you dont know what you are doing, but otherwise are beatable is less than 3 or 2 minutes. The chao garden really makes this game however. It's the reason you'll farm for stat vials and animals and actually replay most of the levels. A ranks take alot of effort to get, so really worrying about that is for later in game if u have not much left to do. The story is pretty crappy, and alot of levels aren't too great in the hero story (because of tails and sonic's space levels) But overall it's still a good game. I highly recommened it"

It has an amazing selection of music, as well as the level design being extremely fun in general to the point where you will find yourself enjoying playing through stages over and over again.Most people don't understand before buying this that this isn't just any Sonic game...  No, in this game, you're raising these little digital pets called Chaos (pronounced chows).  Every enemy you kill will drop a certain colored cannister, which most people end up farming to raise their chao into something wonderful.Even people who don't normally enjoy grinding end up getting caught up in doing anything to get their chao the way that they want, and it slowly becomes an addiction.  This addiction will never stop.  I still have flashbacks from years ago when I played through this game over and over and over and over................Anyhow, if you're looking to play some classic Dreamcast sonic platforming with one of the most amazing and engrossing sideareas in any game, then I would totally recommend picking this game up!"

I occasionally listen to the OST still to this day and might leave the soundtracks on repeat for hours at a time. I'm also part of that group of people who thinks this is one of the better 3D games for Sonic, mechanically. It's true that newer Sonic 3D games have improved on many of the unique issues that arise when developing for a unique character like Sonic, but the gameplay in SA2:B just feels the most controllable. I admit the breakneck speed effects of more recent Sonic games feel more genuine to the character, but this one game still feels the most controllably fluid for me. Then again that might just be more of the nostalgia showing.Unfortunately, I think this is one of those games that you don'treallylike until you've played through it a couple times and have a good feel for the quirky camera and the level layouts and upgrade collections - and a game controller (you really ought to play this one with a game controller).The story wasn't all that amazing to me as a kid and holds even less value to me today - however the premise of Sonic still having an actual attitude and characters having personality archetypes that relate to their traditional reasons for existing, beyond filling a role as ""[acquaintances of the protagonist character],"" is something that makes me perhaps a bit dissapointed with the direction of the franchise since such days of the past.All the Sonic fandom crap aside - Generally speaking, I'd recommend this game to anyone with a game controller and a thing for arcade games.Edit: After playing this on PC with an xbox controller for a few hours - I hate to say it, but it handles much worse than I recall from the Gamecube. So much easier to get caught off-course and have a sudden momentum halt just from gently swiping a polygon the wrong way. It's definitely not as enjoyable as my nostalgia recalls. I may set up the gamecube again someday to compare how the GC version plays against the PC version - it definitely feels different in a bad way. In addition to the controls feeling really over-sensitive, the game has several audible and visual glitches that are new to me - most occuring during the rouge/knuckles maps where you tend to observe the maps in detail while seeking the hidden pieces."

You remember? The best sonic game on the Game Cube!- partial controller support (after heavy modding to get it to work with a wired XBOX 360 controler)- If you buy it on sale like I did, both the main game, DLC, and the fustrations that come with it can be yours for under $5!Holy block of text version:I had this game on the game cube back when this game first came out. Let me get this out of the way now: if you have a GC and access to amazon buy that version, not this POS. First of all this is a god awful port. Before I could even play it I spent the better half of a week learning how to write the code to get around the launcher, becuase if you have an intel GPU this game doesn't recognize any resolutions and will give you an error negative int error. Next issue: you have to disable everything steam to get this game to not freeze on the title screen. Next issue, now you must choos either a consistant frame rate of 30 or a game with synced sound. If you choose to have a refresh rate of 30 (something you need to mod in your launcher code: see issue one) then every cut sceen is out of sync and every ""frame perfect move"" you need to do for speed running is not possible. If you choose to go with 60 fsp (the normal locked speed) then you will have periods were the game laggs to below 15fps and times when it speeds up well past 60 to the point of being uncontrolable. However, the cutscenes are flawlessly synced and and speedrunning clips are possible (you know after trying to speedrun at 15fps... which isnt going to happen). Lastly: If you like City Escape, don't worry they manged to screw that up too! The entire upper half of the screen is covered by a glitched floating trolley! Oh and to ad the icing on the cake: The ""Battle"" part of the title is DLC. so they want another $3 from this glitched mess.Way to ruin my favorite childhood game SEGA!"

The Chao garden is also a decent distraction.CONS: Just like Sonic Adventure, this game has aged like milk. The Tails/Eggman levels are slow and a bit unresponsive at times, and the Knux/Rouge levels are a scavenger hunt. The extra missions can be very tedious at times, and annoying to do. The camera whips around like a drunkard, often times away from where you have to go. The hit detection's a bit wonky in the speed stages as well. The worst though, is without the Battle Addon, the game has no audio, about 75% of sounds missing, and lags horribly.ACHIEVEMENTS: Have fun grinding all of the levels out for A's.FINAL: I can't in full consciousness recommend this game. It's a poor HD port of a poor game, so steer clear if you can."

There are still frames every few seconds and tons sound issues like bad sync and just overall terrible quality, probably because it just emulates the Gamecube version of this game and that really poorly. I've also noticed even more glitches than in the original and that was already barely acceptable to begin with.Other issues are not working lock on moves like the homing attack and terribly wonky controls. Like seriously, you only have to touch the gamepad stick lightly and you already run into an enemy or fall to your death and I haven't even talked about the actual game yet.Which is also terrible. I like Sonic, even a lot of his 3D games, but this is just frustrating and I'm not even talking about the age of it. Of course it's a product of its time, so I'm not gonna complain about the graphics, the voice acting or other superficial things, but the game just isn't fun to play.The Tails/Eggman levels are by far the worst, as all you do in them is hold the fire button and listen to an unbearable beep sound to progress. There's a little platforming here and there, but it's uninteresting as hell because it consists of still or moving platforms and nothing else. Did I mention the excruciating beep sound you hear whenever you press the fire button?The Knuckles/Rouge stages are infamous for being bad but at least they are interesting to explore for the first time. Not terribly, just barely as interesting as Mario 64's hub world, but it's still something. The problem with these however is the task you have to fulfill, which is collecting emerald shards that are randomly placed everywhere on the map, which is not only unfair for those who want to get an A rank, but also very tedious, as it's basically a hide and seek game. On top of that, the sensor you have only detects one shard at a time, which means you can completely miss the other 2 even if you're right next to them, which means that you have to look for them on the entire map up to 3 times.The Sonic/Shadow levels are by far the best thing to come out of this game and they are fairly mediocre. The biggest issues I have with them are the already mentioned terrible controls but also the camera angles. They get you killed a lot, especially towards the end. Level design is also a problem because a lot of them rely on jumping on extremely thin rails, which is borderline impossible with these controls, springs and rails that launch you into enemies, traps that you cannot see coming whatsoever and very long auto sections where you do nothing.In conclusion, I do not recommend this game at all, even if you disagree with me about the game itself. If you somehow still feel the need to play this, just emulate the Dreamcast version instead, at least that one is playable."

I've a soft spot for Sonic and his crew, especially Knuckles. But this game...The controls feel unintuitive and clunky, even navigating the menus are a pain. The annoying thing about ports is that they don't change the instructions to the new platform. There is no green or red action button on my laptop, and it took a lot of trial and error (mostly error) to find the corresponding keys. The camera is horrible, swinging around the place like a sugared-up chimpanzee and the characters all run like they are secreting frictionless grease from the soles of their feet. This game made me use some language my father would NOT approve of, mainly because I'd lose my hard-earned 145 rings when some enemy I COULD NOT EVEN SEE BRUSHES EVER SO GENTLY AGAINST ME. NO! NOT GOOD!  The voice acting isn't great, but I could forgive that considering the time the game out. What I CANNOT forgive is the repeated voice clips any time you do ANY action and mess up because you lack the requesite metahuman reflexes. For heaven's sake, ABE'S ODDYSEE HANDLED BETTER!And that was just the DARK TEAM missions. I couldn't even get past the first Sonic stage, since the underside of a car or something decided to situate itself so that I could only see the bottom half of the screen, meaning I COULD NOT see the enemies directly in my path and kept DYING LIKE A STEPHEN MOFFAT CHARACTER. Adding another sucker-punch to the gonads, is the fact that each level times and ranks you and then your character passive-agressively sasses you based on your performance. Yeah, Sonic Adventure 2 has the BALLS to judge you for being as imperfect as it is. Well it seems like it to me anyway.This is gonna sound weird, but I really enjoyed the Eggman stages, locking onto multiple enemies and blowing the hell out of them was pretty satisfying, but the rest of the combat was terrible.I loved the ""Escape from the City"" song well before I ever attempted this game. I fear now, however, I won't be able to hear it now without the bile of impotent rage forming in my throat as I remeber watching another line of precious golden rings whizz by because I started angling Sonic 2.3 millennia too late. Maybe it's  for more competent gamers than I, but its a ""No"" from me.DO NOT WANT!P.S.: AND I DIDN'T EVEN GET TO PLAY AS KNUCKLES. $%*#@!"

This game use to be fun back in the day of the Dreamcast and the Nintendo GameCube days. Now that I've gotton older, I have noticed so MANY FLAWS with this game it's unreal.Lemme list some positives first thoughPositives+Fantastic Soundtrack (One of the best in the series)+2 Player Battle mode is pretty fun+Now it's in Widescreen HD+Big the Cat is gone!+The levels are pretty damn memorable (unless you don't play the game a lot)+Chao Garden is much better than the firstWell that seems like good things right? Eh... not really. There's many problems I just can't stand about this game.GameplayI loved the story in Sonic Adventure DX! But in this game...... not so much. I do like the introduction of Shadow and Rouge, but Shadow is just a simple clone of him. He controls almost exactly the same as Sonic, and I just feel like I'm playing some re-skin fanmade game of Sonic. Oh and Rouge? Same thing! She controls exactly like Knuckles to! And Tails? My GOD REALLY SEGA? He's the same as Omega! The ""Dark"" characters are basically the same. They just feel like re-skins. I get that's what SEGA was going for, but it feels SO LAZY.Anyway Sonic and Shadow have the speedy platforming parts of the gameKnuckles and Rouge have the Treasure Finding parts of the game.Tails and Omega have the ""SHOOT EVERYTHING BECAUSE I HAVE A ROBOT THAT IMMA FIRIN MA LAZAR"" parts of the game.Well here's the problem. If I only wanted to play as Sonic, I could just play as Sonic. In this game I'm FORCED to play as the other characters just to complete the Hero or Dark story. Really? In Sonic Adventure DX, I wasn't forced to play as anyone I didn't want to! All I played as was Sonic, Tails, Knuckles, and Amy. I wasn't forced to play as Omega (but I did anyway) or Big the Cat. Why change that? Like honestly? SEGA, tell me why?Another major problem with this game is the trasure hunting stages. It may be ""minor"", but it's FRUSTRATING AS♥♥♥♥♥♥ In SADX, the blinker would indicate whenever your near a Piece of the Master Emerald right? Well it does it in SA2, but ONLY IF IT'S IN ORDER. WHY?! I'll be right next to a god damn Piece and it won't blink? Wanna know why? Because it's not in order. What the hell SEGA? Another thing is Tails and Omega. They both use to be fun! Now they're not! Instead of doing basic platforming with Tails, he's now gone Super Mega Death Christ mode and now shoots the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of everything like Omega did in SADX. I'm sorry. But that only worked for Omega and NOT Tails.The only fun playable characters in the game is Sonic and Shadow. SEGA really screwed over the other characters which I'm REALLY angry about. Also why is 2 player Battlemode DLC if you can't even play it online? The Nintendo GameCube came with it for free in Sonic Adventure 2: Battle. So why not this game?The StoryIt's mainly like every generic sonic Story. Stop Eggman done. Oh by the way, Shadow exists now. GG no RE.StagesCity Escape and Metal Harbor are the only fun and memorable stages in the game for me. Every other stage is forgettable, because the other stages have extremely terrible enemy placement and unfair platforming sections. Absolutely disgusting.PC PortWhile it's not the best, it's... decent. It has full controller support, runs at 60 FPS with no slowdowns, and looks pretty decent for the HD remake. Only problem is the game crashes when I play in my Fullscreen Native resolution. Why does it do that? I'll never know. It's not optimized that great to say the least. Also if you press any key on your keyboard while in controller mode, it'll switch back to the keyboard like in Sonic Generations and you can't switch back unles you restart the game.Final Verdict / TL;DRSonic Adventure 2 is an overrated piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥that didn't help make the Sonic Adventure series better. Poor enemy placement, unfair platofmorming sections, boring treasure hunting and robot shooting gameplay, and a not-so-good- PC port. The soundtrack is amazing and Sonic is a blast to play as, but the rest is trash and unenjoyable for me. Save your money and go buy Sonic 3 and Knuckes, Sonic Generations, or better yet the ORIGINAL Sonic Adventure. Keep in mind, this is coming from a long time Sonic fan! I've been playing Sonic games for all my life and this is one of the most disappointing games in the franchise! Yes you can argue all you want about Sonic 06 and Sonic Boom, but that still doesn't change my opinion that I don't like this game!Final Rating 4/10"

Another problem with emulations is one that can't always be fixed, especially with video/audio intensive games like SA2: the framerate.  I understand that SEGA did emulated games on Steam before, such asSonic 3 and Knuckles, as well as other companies, such as SQUARE ENIX'sFinal Fantasy VIIandFinal Fantasy VIII, but these games are excused.  Why?  Because they are nowhere near as video (or audio) intensive as the game in question, and therefore, there is no lag (and if there is, then why are you even using your horrible computer to play games?).  And I have no problem with framerate drops, usually, as long as it isn't drastic.  The thing about this game's low framerate is that it doesn't skip frames to make up for it; it slows the whole game down.  If you look at the timer in the top-left, you may notice that 1 second seems unusually long.  This is a problem, especially in a game that is all about speed; however, I do have to give credit on one thing: the music and sound effects don't slow down with the framerate, which is very nice.  It would be even nicer if the rest of the game didn't slow down!  All in all, I love this game, but seriously, get the Dreamcast version or Gamecube version, or if you have a PS3 or XBOX360 with internet, you can buy them off of their respective online shops, bringing up one more question: why dothoseones run so well?"

This is the sequel to the TRUE revolutionizing 3D Sonic Game on the DREAMCAST, which was by the same name without the 2.Two: All the DLC does is unlock the bonus feature of 2P battle that was introduced in the re-make on the Gamecube, so there's nothing really lost by not getting it unless you have two controllers and want to play with somebody else in this glitch-fest.Anyway, as for my quick little review. While the game itself is stellar, or should be, the PC port is a hunk of dung that I'm glad I didn't buy for it being Sonic Adventure 2. I luckily got it as part of a bigger bundle, and honestly the levels and controls are extremely glitchy on this port and I find myself dying many times because of hitting invisible walls, having my speed inverted, falling through ground, or just plain having my screen turn black for 10 seconds while the video dies despite the game continuing on, which ends up desyncing the audio/video.As much as I really, truly want to recommend this game, after playing a little bit of it, the glitchiness is just too much to handle. I'm going to try playing some more later, but honestly it's hard to play a game you love when the mechanics of it are as broken as this. If at all possible, play the Gamecube port, and/or the Gamecube port of Sonic Adventure (DX). I'm honestly not sure if it's worth it to play this if you've never played Sonic Adventure (2/battle) before since I feel it will leave a terrible impression upon the two games.tl;drThe game itself is amazing, but the engine is broken on PC. People who think this is the ground breaking original 3D game are ill-informed."

What Sega *should* do is rework the physics engine, allow the player to setup the controller so the B button doesn't do 7 different things, fix the broken boss fights, and hire a better level designer to tweak all the levels in the game, because they are mostly all really poorly designed.  But of course Sega will never do that for a 15 year old game, and I can't expect them to.  But it would be nice and it would make this game much better."

I am sorry to all of you who loved this game, but there are so many things that are horrible about this game, that i am surpirsed everyone is ok with it. Now before i go on, i would like to say that this is coming from a massive Sonic the Hedgehog fan and i haven't played it during the days it was released, so because of so much praise it got, like saying that after this game, Sonic's reputation went downhill, but, in my honest opinion, i believe it started with Sonic Adventure games. Anyway, the 1st problem i have with this game are the controls. They are as clunky as hell. Everytime i try to run really fast on Sonic/Shadow section, chances are that i will either hit something or i will fall of the platform and die, because of how uncontrollably fast they are going. The 2nd problem i have with this game is the Camera. That thing has a mind of it's own. I mean, sometimes you can control it by yourself and sometimes it just locks in one position, and when you want to look around to see if there are enemies or not, you will have a bad time. The 3rd problem is the level design. Actually, for the most part, it's good, but there are sometimes unpredictable obstacles that you will be losing life a lot in those parts (Especially at the ARK levels). So, overall, it was more frustrating to play than fun, and i wouldn't recommend to someone who is not a Sonic fan, and even not to Sonic fans who haven't played this game yet."

I'm sad that I can't like this game.Sonic Adventure 2 is considered one of the greatest 3D Sonic games of all time. I have played it before and I thought it was good. However, I recommend you play the game on anything BUT PC. First of all, the controls are only labled during the part when you can change your resolution, which was unacceptable for me. If you can even get the game to play, you'll soon know that the controls are aweful, especially for PC. Even after changing them multiple times, the game was very hard then what I remember playing it on the gamecube. In fact, the controls are SO BAD that I can't even get past THE FIRST BOSS OF THE GAME. Not only that, but the games crashes and freezes, which is very frustrating. I recommend that you use a controller IF YOU CAN EVEN FIND ONE THAT IS COMPATIBLE. As far as I know, the only controller that works with this is the Xbox 360 Controller, which means if you don't own an Xbox 360, you'll have to pay something like $50 to just play this game okayer. Hopefully, they decide to make more controllers compatible in the future, but I highly doubt that SEGA will add that into a future update.

76561197983316414,Not Recommended,213610,20844054,"Posted: 30 January, 2016",all,litbolt,"I've played and beaten Sonic 2, 3 & Knuckles, CD, Adventure 1 & 2, Heroes, Shadow the Hedgehog, Sonic 2006, 4 Episode 1 & 2, the DS version of Colors, Generations (including the Unleashed levels mod), and nearly finished Lost World, and I have to say... Slowly eroding nostalgia and stockholm syndrome are the only things that keep me playing his 3D outings.You probably already know whether or not you're going to buy Sonic Adventure 2 before you read a review of it. You most likely played it when you were younger, or are a fan of later Sonic games curious about his past. Reading this might not change your mind, but I can assure you of one thing: This game has not aged well. Sound familiar? Sonic Adventure 1 is the same way, and many of its mistakes apply to the sequel as well.Sonic Adventure 2 once again tells the story of Dr. Eggman's attempts to rule the world, and Sonic the Hedgehog and co.'s attempts to stop him. This time he's got a plan that might actually work - He's stolen Dr. Evil's ""laser"" from Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me and is holding the world hostage. What for isn't made clear. It's not money. He wants power. But what he plans to do with it once he has it isn't really addressed. Helping him is Shadow the Hedgehog, a genetically engineered super hog created by Eggman's grandfather, and Rouge the Bat, a government spy/jewel theif who doesn't know the meaning of ""conflict of interest"". The good guys just follow them around trying to stop them. No dreams or ambitions of their own.The overall story, when written in a few non-sarcastic sentences, I really like. Seeing that story unfold is like watching a Mystery Science Theater movie without the riffing. The acting is either bad, or passable by accident (my favorite scene is when Eggman hurts Sonic, and Tails lackadaisically says ""I will never forgive you for this""). It's also localized poorly. Often it seems characters are saying whatever is in their mind at that moment rather than having a coherent conversation. There are many instances of odd wordings and sentence structure. The technical issues SA1 had in its cutscenes have been reduced ever so slightly, but many still remain. Lip synching is all over the place. Characters talk over each other, and sometimes, themselves. They make odd movements while talking to one another. It *is* better than SA1, but it's not what I'd call good.The game is separated into Hero and Dark storylines. There's no overworld this time, just cutscenes and action stages. Each side has three characters who are basically clones of each other. Sonic and Shadow run through linear levels quickly, with lots of platforming and occasional puzzle solving. Eggman and Tails use mech suits with guns to shoot their way through too-complex platforming stages. Knuckles and Rouge search for Master Emerald shards (or other items) in non-linear levels that quickly become too large for their own good.Sonic Team did seem to learn a few lessons from SA1. Sonic and Shadow's levels are laid out like racetracks. Minimal side paths and long straight stretches where you can run freely. These are easily the most fun levels to play. Camera issues are minimalized by not having lots of corners and objects in the way. But they added some new design issues. Both can do a Light Speed Dash to zip along a line of rings. It helps you get around, but it shares a button with both a somersault attack and the spin dash move. There will be many, MANY times where you'll go to spin dash and will instead be flung at some nearby rings, or try to use some rings to get over a gap and will instead somersault right over the edge. Sonic also has a bounce move that shares the same button, so a mistimed Light Speed Dash in the air means instant death. Technical issues with basic movement are still shared with SA1 as well, so slight variations in ground height or angle will cause energetic spasms in your character.Tails and Eggman play much like E-102 Gamma did in SA1. They shoot their way through levels, using a targeting laser to mark enemies for destruction. For some reason I don't mind the sound much, but it does make a high pitched tone whenever you do this, which will be all the time. The level layouts themselves are more complex than the hogs', and this does not work in their favor. Sonic is supposed to be about going fast, and the mech suits Eggman and Tails inhabit move slow. The later levels often have closed gates that you have to locate the switches for before you can proceed, which makes them take even longer. Basic movement is still riddled with technical issues. Early on you gain the ability to extend your jumps by hovering, but lightly brushing up against a wall will cause you to plummet downwards instantly, causing many accidental deaths. Camera problems are also in full effect when in tight areas. The camera does not get stuck nearly as often as it used to in SA1, but it often manages to find just the wrong angle for the jump you're trying to make or the enemy you're trying to target. That said, it *IS* better than SA1's camera. It feels like they actually played the levels and tried to choose somewhat reasonable angles.Knuckles and Rouge's levels are scavenger hunting affairs that mirror Knuck's levels from SA1. These are my least favorite levels to play because of one stupid design decision: the proximity detector that used to show any item of interest in range now only shows one at a time. It artificially inflates the time you spend wandering around, and I hate it. This doesn't matter much for the first few levels, since they are small. But both of their final levels take place in space, and are huge. If you haven't been playing these levels since you were 13 like I have, you can easy spend 45+ minutes in them, going in futile circles until you reset the level in the hopes of getting better item locations (like I did when I was 13). The level designs are often confusing. One of Knuckles' levels takes place in an underground mine and involves changing water levels to open paths to different mine shafts. The tight spaces are great for getting the camera blocked in bad angles. Rouge's final level takes place in space near planetoids that will gravitationally attract you. It's like Mario Galaxy, but worse. Both characters are capable of gliding, and climbing on certain walls. There's a new attack in this game, the Drill Dive, that lets you dive downwards while gliding, and it's actually pretty good. It looks cool, can destroy enemies effectively, and lets you dig in the ground for items.The Chao garden returns, and it has the same system as in SA1DX. I don't really care for the Chao garden, but it doesn't detract from the main game, so I don't mind it existing.Upsides? Like most Sonic games, the music is pretty good. Live & Learn, and especially the vocal theme to Sonic's first level, City Escape, are songs I own outside the game. Sonic's Metal Harbor stage also has a ska-like track that is my personal favorite from the game. Even when not memorable, the stage music always matches the stage environment well. *Sometimes* the graphics can be impressive, mostly when they use actual photographs as textures, though the polygon count is still pretty low. The final boss battle, featuring Super Sonic and Super Shadow in space trying to stop a giant lizard from destroying the Earth while Live & Learn plays is genuinely exciting. If you really memorize Sonic and Shadow's levels, you can actually have some fun with this game. Their abilities make sense with the level design, even if they're all mapped to one button.You already know whether or not you're going to buy this game. SA2 has more fun potential than SA1, but can also be much more frustrating. They both average out to being pretty bad games. I still play them, because I'm a true Sonc fan. I stick with him through the bad times. Nostalgia aside, I wish there were more good times to be had with him."

Most of the enemies die when hit sometimes.

,Not Recommended,213610,31961379,Posted: 25 May,all,Lenovo IdeaPad 310,"Although this game is hailed as one of the best 3D Sonic games of all time, unfortunately in my opinion, it is a load of utter crap that has somehow gotten even worse than its predecessor SADX. While the graphics, animation, plot, camera, and progression are vastly improved upon, the level design, mechanics, and controls got hell of a lot worse. I've always agreed that gameplay is always better than aesthetics and it holds true to SA2 (of course having both being high quality being preferred). I understand that Sonic Team was trying to add more than the first game, but if it ain't broke, why bother fixing it then?First, let's talk about the good stuff so you guys don't assume I hate this title. Unlike the awkwardness of SADX, with SA2 the game is locked at a consistent 60 fps no matter the resolution and has widescreen support. Voice acting no longer sounds like a half-butt cartoon with the animations being more fluid and natural. The plot is more dark and serious although it still suffers from paradoxes and plotholes. Even though it was released originally for the DreamCast, it definitley looks like something you'd play on the PS2, Game-Cube, or Xbox.Although there isn't a hubworld, you just go immediately to the next level instead of having to complete mundane tasks just to progress. You can also always go back and play whatever levels you want once they're beaten, so if you despise certain levels, you don't need to play them ever again. The camera finally doesn't get stuck by objects in the background as if there were an actual camera, and you can use the right control stick of your controller instead of only using the trigger buttons which isn't practical all the time. Just like with SADX, Adventure 2 also supports any kind of controller, as I managed to play it with my Game-Cube controller no problem.Now let's expose how bad this game really is starting with the rank system. This is the first Sonic game to actually get a rank based on your performance. What damn sucks is that you have to get as much rings, defeat all enemies in sight, take alternate routes, don't die at all, and have the fastest record simultaneously to achieve a high rank. Most people even with skill and/or experience in Sonic games will get C or D rank, with exceptional players getting B rank. If you thought getting the emblems in SADX was annoying, then you're only going to get♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off, so I don't recommend getting them all unless you care about Steam achievements.Controls and level design are so bad, the only thing that surpasses it would be Sonic '06. Controls are either too responsive or delayed which can often get me killed or injured often. Even those that played games like Unleashed and SADX will notice how hard it is to adapt to this. Add that with the crappy level design where there's poor collision detection, bad enemy placement, hard-to-reach platforms, and crappy puzzles, and you'll never want to play lots of these levels again.Instead of playing with 6 different play styles, it's only three: high speed action, treasure hunting, and shooting. The shooting levels are the worst as the design and controls often lead you dying, stuck, and/or frustrated. Treasure hunting also is boring and confusing since the radar this time only detects one emerald piece instead of all three, further delaying the time. Boss battles are much more challenging this time around with the later bosses angering even the better Sonic players out there who have PTSD from them.I can honestly keep going on, but that would be boring and redundant, so let's wrap this up. You will die and struggle a lot on your first playthrough, with subsequent ones being a joke or very easy. If you get stuck, refer to a walkthrough guide and don't try aiming for a high rank. Oh right, there's multiplayer where you can race, hunt, and shoot with a second player locally, but a lot of the content is locked by DLC. If you're interested in getting and enjoying a good Sonic game, just get Sonic Adventure DX or better yet, Sonic Generations."

,Not Recommended,213610,26494438,"Posted: 8 November, 2016",all,Zero,"This game is EXTREMELY overrated. Most of the appeal for this game stems from nostalgia, and if you don't have any such nostalgia, then, like me, you won't view this game to be God's gift to 3D platforming like all the fanboys would lead you to believe.Now, the following is from the view of an outsider looking in; I never played this in the time it came out, so I'm looking at the aspects of the game compared to more contemporary games I've played.So, what's BAD about this game?Well, for starters, the voice acting. 95% of the time, it sounds like the voice actors are reading off of teleprompters. Special mention goes to Rouge. I find my hand rapidly connecting with my face almost every time she opens her badly animated mouth.Which leads us to another problem: inconsistent lip-syncing. Sometimes the characters' words match up with the movement of the mouth no problem. But, most of the time, their mouth movements arecompletelyout of sync.Now, on to actual gameplay.Sonic and Shadow's stages are okay. You get to blaze through the level at high speed (most of the time) like one should when taking control of these speed demons. However, enemy placement is NOT one of the strengths of these levels. you have been warned.Tails and Eggman's stages aren't that bad, but one logical issue that really bugs me is, when they hold onto those rope lifts, how do they stay in their mechs without their arms getting ripped out of their sockets? I'm sorry if this seems trivial,  but I can only suspend my disbelief so far.Now, onto the WORST stages: Knuckles and Rouge's. I wish the aforementioned bad voice acting was the only problem here, but no, there's worse. The biggest problem I've seen thus far is the dig mechanic. As many of you probably know, when you're close to the emerald piece (or whatever random item the game wants you to find), you hear a beeping noise and see an indicator of how close you are. When you're EXTREMELY close, an exclamation point appears above the character's head. The problem is, it does so within a certain radius. In the event that the piece is w/ an enemy, in a box, or out in the open, this works just fine. However, in the event that it's buried in the ground or in a wall, your job is made INFINITELY more difficult, as the game is very anal about the digging hitboxes. If you're even a MILLIMETER off, then you aren't getting that item, pal. This is made worse by the fact that except for the first stage for both Rouge and Knuckles,every single one of their stageshas at least one item buried somewhere. Happy hunting, sucker!One final note: boss battles.The boss battles are shamefully terrible for a Sonic game. That's all.So, not factoring in nostalgic appeal, this game is ""Meh"" quality at best, and ""Oh god, someone pour me a glass of Clorox!"" quality at worst. It may have been mindblowing back in the day, but it has NOT aged well.Put simply, if you aren't considering buying it due to nostalgia, you're better off spending the cash elsewhere."

I kept hearing good things about it, though, and Sonic fans always claim that this one is where it's at, this is the best Sonic game ever made. Sorry to break it to you, kids, but you're wrong. SA2 may have been good but it aged TERRIBLY.The controls and camera are so bad the game is almost unplayable, even with a controller. Without a controller, it IS unplayable. At first I thought this was normal back then, but then I realised this came out in 2001! So many good third person games were out by that point (namely the Tomb Raider franchise) that there is absolutely no excuse for this mess.The cutscenes are cringy with godawful lipsync, and often you have songs with actual lyrics loudly blaring in the background while the characters are mumbling their lines quietly. Without subtitles you wouldn't even know what's going on, and there are no sound options in the game. The graphics also aren't anything to write home about. They may have been impressive on consoles, but for PC this would be bad even back then. Tomb Raider Chronicles came out a full year before this game, and looked much better.If you want to play a good 3D Sonic, get Sonic Generations which is the best Sonic game released in the past 10 years. If you have access to consoles, get Sonic Unleashed or Sonic Colours. Just avoid Sonic Adventure 2 like the plague.

Even buying their good games supports bad practices.Sonic in particular is high profile enough that any future games are likely to be affected by Sega's worst policies for DLC and DRM. This particular game doesn't include any 3rd party DRM but it probably would if it were more recent.I have a soft spot for Adventure 2 but, while its engine was impressive for running at 480P 60fps on Dreamcast & its mechanics for Sonic improved on Adventure, the level design is weaker than its predecessor.The speed levels have a lot more walls or elongated straight lines getting in the way of taking shortcuts & feel more linear in general; the hunting stages have a heavily nerfed radar coupled with a much larger scale that makes exploring them more frustrating; & the shooting stages are much slower & clunkier than Gamma was.I don’t see why nearly everything except jump is mapped to B/Circle. Sonic seems to have a reputation for simple control schemes but this is the wrong kind of simplification with the light dash & bounce being a particularly unfortunate combination that will result in numerous lost lives.There are odd graphical glitches which are exclusive to this port. On my hardware the worst issue I've encountered is all the objects in the Chao Garden retexturing themselves at random upon leaving the Chao Stadium.On other people's hardware a glitch causes cars and trams to somehow get stuck to Sonic in the first level, apparently rendering it unplayable. Luckily it never happened to me even when I tried it on my laptop that's too weak to run the game at full speed.Another somewhat infamous glitch exclusive to the HD port (on all platforms) causes the Chao key to consistently glitch in certain levels & send the player to a test level upon completion.Sega never even attempted to fix these issues, leaving it to fans to help those who couldn't play the game.The port does run at 60fps, less would've been inexcusable, but that's because it's locked at it. Any drops make the whole game slow down. Any increase makes the whole game speed up. I’m sure the Dreamcast original was capable of running at the correct speed at 50fps in PAL mode and 30fps/25fps in multiplayer but that’s not possible on PC.As with the port of the original Sonic Adventure, texture and audio quality have taken a hit compared to the Gamecube port and the Dreamcast original in turn.Once more there is no way to access or transfer content to or from Adventure DX's Chao Garden nor anything which required Tiny Chao.I'll give credit for attempting to restore Big the Cat's cameos (removing some unreachable rings in the process) but for some reason one of them was left out.A number of other touches I enjoyed in the Dreamcast version have been omitted too such as the hedges in City Escape spelling ""Welcome"" as opposed to the plain grass that's even more barren looking in this wide-screen version.Likewise instead of inserting some of the billboards in the city that didn't make the jump between Dreamcast and Gamecube for variety's sake, Sega simply removed as many references to Soap as possible which means the billboards that are still there are repeated far more often.No attempt has been made to recreate the Dreamcast version's DLC content either. Truth be told there wasn't much of interest but there are character skins, karts and at least one kart race that's not accessible in this version.I don't believe the leaderboards of the console HD port are accessible on PC. No big loss, they'd just be hacked, but I wouldn't know because I mostly play in Offline Mode.Why, then, would I have so many hours on record? The Achievement for raising a Hero & Dark Chao glitched out and refused to unlock until I started a new Chao Garden save & earned the achievement again while online. Every other achievement unlocks just fine in offline mode.I don’t see why this game couldn’t have been sold on GoG or DRM-free on the Humble Store. Even before the PC port existed pirates already had access to the previous console releases so it’s not like DRM is saving them anything. At this point Sega are just turning down willing customers.Lastly, as someone who owns and has completed the Dreamcast original, it irks me that Green Hill is exclusive to the Battle ""DLC"" when it was never exclusive to Gamecube. Every other bit of the DLC is pointless but Green Hill is probably in the top 2 levels in the game in terms of how fun it is to speed run."

The story sucks and dosen't make any sense. the physics are terrible. the controls are F'cked in the♥♥♥♥♥ The camera also sucks. U often get hit by an enemy when u have NO time to react, this will mostly happend on the mech shotting levels. Every level that takes place in space that has Anti-graviti sections have ABSOLUTE S#IT ANTI-GRAVITI CONTROLLS, Some missions are down right bulls#it. It requiers too much effort to get all 180 emblems/100% game complition. If u don't have the Battle DLC, U can only get 90/180 emblems which is very dumb, but at least the Battle DLC is very Cheap.The music is quite good, but i kinda hate that almost every level and every boss music is just rock. The other levels like that are for Rouge has smooth jazz that are ok, BUT Knuckles' stages have rap, but they are EXTREMLY corny. Very corny. 2 things that i like about the game is Mods and the Chao Garden."

This appears to be fixed nowThe camera is godawful, if you change the camera angle it will switch back when you move, the camera sometimes gets 'stuck' so you're in a room but all you can see is a wall and the angle sometimes changes mid jump which kills you in some levels.All in all it feels like the game developers just imported this over from the PS3/XB360, added a start menu before the game lauches then left it.It's a good game but the bugs really kill the game sometimes."

It has two story modes, the Good side and the Dark side. The good side features the characters Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles. The Dark side features Doctor Ivo ""Eggman"" Robotnik, and two new characters that made their debut in this game, Shadow the Hedgehog and Rouge the Bat. Both sides offer speed stages, which feature the two hedgehogs, treasure hunting stages, featuring Knuckles and Rouge, and mech suit shoot-em-up stages, featuring Tails and Dr. Eggman. This game did so many things right, I can hardly point out any flaws. Some of the gameplay mechanics get repetitive, the power-ups can seem like too much of a hassle, and getting the highest rank on every mission requires weeks, if not months of dedication. All in all, I definitely reccommend this game to any fan of Sonic the Hedgehog, or just SEGA in general."

Plot: its okay for the most part but there are a couple of things that, while not TOO important, could have gave depth to some characters but weren't fleshed out enough. Sonic/Shadow Gameplay: REALLY FUN! The only levels that i liked the least was Final Rush & Final Chase, if only because of the over abundance of rail grinding. Overall though, i had a lot of fun with these stages. Control was fluid & the level design was great. Tails/Dr Eggman Gameplay: Meh. Not a huge fun but Dr Eggmans stages, especially Cosmic Wall, were a lot of fun. Tails though has poor level design and was not fun to play as. Control was pretty stiff too. Knuckles/Rouge Gameplay: I dont know what to say, to have a good time with these levels you have to be patient alot of times. Although the control is great, you might have to be patient to get full enjoyment from these levels. I didn't mind them. Boss fights: Pretty easy in my opinion. Even the Biolizard and the Finalhazard were easy despite what people have said. Music: Great, but Adventure has a better soundtrack though (IN MY OPINION). The only music that i found REALLY memorable were, Live & Learn (DUH!), City Escape And Pumpkin Hill. I have a guilty pleasure for Pumpkin Hill and City Escape and Live & Learn are iconic. Voice acting:Okay, the voice acting in this game can mostly be good although there are moments where you will laugh at the delivery of some lines, Eggman ""LET'S GET TO WOOOORKK!!!!"" Overall: Sonic Adventure 2 has not aged as well as Sonic Adventure (which baffles me!) but for £5.99 (99p including the Battle dlc), it is recommended even if some of the mech stages (especially Tails's stages) can be poor in design and Knuckles and Rouges stages can require you to be very patient at times. Despite some of the negative things about this game, you should give it a go and hey, you may even like it! Score: I don't do scores as it makes the reader actually READ the stupid REVIEW!"

Sonic Adventure DX was so broken, glitchy, sloppy I almost threw up several times. It was one of those games that only gained its popularity for being a 3D Sonic game that looked alright on Dreamcast then got ugly on later consoles. Anyway enough whining about that mess. I decided to play this game after beating DX on the GameCube only because it came in a Sonic Bundle that saved me $5 dollars on the racing games that were the only ones I cared about and included every other Sonic game on Steam as a bonus to me. This game did something that DX never did and that was adding a challenge. The difficulty is no longer a joke, but rather something to take seriously. I enjoyed myself very much to my surprise. The boss fights were fun, the stages were fun, the story was pretty good for revolving around a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ blue hedgehog. It really feels like a lot more work and thought went into this. The characters are annoying, yet I was entertained throughout. Sonic is an♥♥♥♥♥in this game. Anyhow there are still flaws in the fact that the treasure hunting sequences are broken more than they were in the last game and when you go to space as Rouge the bat you will want to break something. Also the Chao Garden is a great waste of time. Some people enjoyed it, but I didn't see the point. Sonic and Shadow stages are where this game shines and are very fun to replay. Tails and Robotnik/Eggman stages are ok for changing things up. Only Rouge and Knuckles have the downers of the game.

This was a favorite from back during the dreamcast era.So this game is a PC port of the re-released HD version for Xbox 360 and PS3. The port isn't really an HD remake. The textures are the same and cannot be upscaled. Anisotropic filtering? Nah. Higher resolution textures? Forget about it. Increase draw distance to remove annoying pop in? Nope. On release this game also had an issue with running the game in hyperspeed but has since been fixed thankfully.Ignore the story, it's pretty dumb. 14 year old me loved it but I'm 26 now and yeah. XDThis game plays in three distinct modes, so I guess you can call it something like a 3 in one platformer or something.Sonic/Shadow is sort of like a racing game with platforming. The physics feel very floaty, like somewhere between moon gravity and earth gravity when on the ground. This lends itself to some fun chaining with homing attacks and some rather impressive tricks for hitting perfectly timed shortcuts. The camera is sometimes your enemy as it swings wildly from side to side. This is easily the best part of the game.Tails/Dr. Robotnik gameplay is a battle mech robot with lock on targeting for firing missles. The gravity in this game mode is very heavy, as if you were a planet twice as big as earth. There are some very boring slow platforming sections. The high weight and gravity on your character can become frustrating when you're rushing to platform but the robot can only jump 2 inches off the ground. You get points based on chaining your missle lock on. Again the camera is not your friend. This feels like filler.Knuckles/Rouge gameplay is a treasure hunt style where you have to collect three of an object hidden in the stage. It uses the same physics from the Sonic/Shadow stages and is based on exploration. The aim is to find the items in the fastest way possible without any hints. The last two big zones are the best. Some of these stages can become tiresom when you just can't figure out where the last item is. It's alright but it's not for everyone.So yeah this game plays like an old game. It released in 2001. It's now 2014. Hard to believe so much time has gone by. For sonic fans, def pick it up. For everyone else, pick it up on a sale and try it out. It's not bad and you'll get to laugh at the dumbest plots only an old video game can give you.Oh. And I love the soundtrack of this game. I enjoy all the vocal tracks including the cheesy rap songs for Knuckles' stages."

,Recommended,213610,11882657,"Posted: 27 August, 2014",all,ZHDINC,"Sonic Adventure 2 is what 3D Sonic games should aspire to be! Admittedly, I might be viewing this game with a certain level of nostalgia clouding my viewpoint, but Sonic Adventure 2 is really just awesome. I first played this game on the Gamecube and it is one of those few games that I never considered boring to play. Sonic Team really knew what they were doing in this game (I wish I could say that about some of the later entries in the series).For starters, the pacing issues of the first Sonic Adventure are just gone. There are six playable characters in SA2 much like the first one, but you don't have to start the story over and over for each character. Instead, you just play each character's stages as they occur in the plot, which is far less jarring. Additionally, there is no Adventure Field in this game, so there is no longer the tedium of searching for random items or areas to advance the plot between levels.There are two storylines that you get to follow: Hero and Dark. There is some overlap between the two stories, but the overlaps are mostly for the boss battles so they don't particularly last that long (and they tend to involve each rival character pairing). The dynamics between the characters are much improved, and the conversations feel a lot more natural as a result (though this might just be because of a better localization effort). There really isn't a wasted moment either as every scene plays into the overall plot.The most interesting part of Sonic Adventure 2 is how they managed to capture the length of the 2D Sonic games. This isn't exactly a long game for either storyline, and each side can be easily beaten in one sitting. The game never feels stale either because of the variety in stages. There are three different kinds of stages. The first type involves Sonic or Shadow and, much like the original Sonic games, simply requires you to get to the end of the stage in an expedient manner. The second type involves Tails or Dr. Eggman, and you use the lock-on abilities of chicken walker mechs to rack up chains for points. Finally, the third type of stage involves Knuckles or Rouge, and you have to search for items hidden within the level using a hot or cold kind of radar system. In addition, there is one driving stage in each storyline, but considering that this game is mostly an action platformer, the driving mechanics are understandably terrible (the vehicles don't really have any maneuverability around corners).The game ranks you based on how quickly you completed a stage (or rather how highly you scored, which includes a time bonus for completing the stage quickly). The ranks add a nice layer of depth to the game and are an easy way to measure how well you performed in a stage without needing to continually reference your personal best. Rank A's are appropriately difficult to achieve and are extremely satisfying to obtain at the end of a level. Unfortunately, you will more than likely be good friends with Rank E on your initial playthroughs of different stages, especially if you die at all. Unlike the early Sonic games, the score isn't cumulative, so it will reset to zero after every death. Essentially, any death far into a level pretty much guarantees a Rank E finish, so there is a strong incentive to survive from beginning to end. Though I found that Sonic and Shadow's levels are hard to get a high rank even if you survive to the end of the level.After completing a stage in Story mode, it is unlocked in Stage Select and there will be an additional four missions to accompany the stage, each with their own scoring requirements. For example, the second mission of every stage in the game requires you to get 100 rings as fast as you can. So even after completing the somewhat short story modes, there will still be plenty of content to go through. Through completing stages and achieving high ranks, you will be rewarded with emblems of which there are 180 in the entire game. I believe it is possible to get all 180 emblems, but will require considerable patience (I've only just acquired 90 emblems which easily took over 20 hours of play time). The emblems based around the mini-games within the Chao Garden are particularly difficult as it requires raising the perfect chao, but nothing compares to the difficulty of the additional driving missions (one of which involves avoiding hitting cars with exceptionally large hitboxes and to make matters worse...the cars can hit you from behind).The Chao Garden was an interesting concept in the first game, but it is expanded upon greatly in this game. The Chao are a kind of digital pet with stats and life cycles, and thankfully, this isn't just a tacked on feature in the game as it is integrated into normal gameplay. Each stage has animals hidden throughout and the enemies will also drop items called Chaos Drives. Using either the Chao key hidden within one of the boxes in the level or accessing the garden directly through stage select, you can give the Drives and animals that you collect to the Chao to raise their stats. The higher the stats of a Chao, the better it will be able to perform in the Chao Race or Chao Karate mini-games. The Beginner events in either of these mini-games aren't so difficult, but it will be very time consuming to beat anything higher than that. The Chao also get a Hero, Dark, or neutral affiliation based on which characters show the Chao affection. There is a considerable amount of depth surrounding the Chao Garden and it is almost like getting a second separate game in addition to Sonic Adventure 2. I wish other games had bonus content with this level of depth.As for the actual playing of Sonic Adventure 2, you can comfortably use a keyboard or gamepad. When I played with the keyboard, I mapped the action buttons to the number pad and kept movement on WASD. It is very playable with that setup, but the game was originally intended for a gamepad, so use one if you have one. The graphics have aged well especially with whatever touchups that were applied to the PC release, but don't expect it to be several generations ahead of the original's graphical look. I must say it is wonderful to be able to play this in 1080p resolution.The physics are a lot better than Sonic Adventure, but there is still the occasional odd moment (luckily, you are unlikely to fall off of loops like in the first game). The rail sections over bottomless pits can be some of the most frustrating parts of the game and sometimes the game just won't register contact with the rail resulting in many cheap deaths. Besides the rail sections, a few of the boss battles can be downright picky about what constitutes a valid hit. Beyond that, I wouldn't say I have any complaints about the game mechanics (though the cheapshots from enemies and environmental hazards that Sonic games are known for are still as frustrating as ever).Just like usual, Sonic Adventure 2 has a great soundtrack. Who doesn't want to sing along to the first level's ever popular ""Escape from the City""? The rap lyrics in Knuckle's levels are unquestionably terrible, but it's composed so well that it actually ends up being good somehow (at least, I thought so). My favorite music is all the songs in Rouge's levels.As for performance, I played this on both a GTX 560 Ti and GTX 780. The game was completely stable on the 560 Ti, but I did encounter random display driver crashes with the 780, so your mileage may vary. The screen would go black and the sound would loop, but the game would ultimately recover from it after a few seconds (and luckily, the action would pause during that time, so the few crashes I experienced never ended up too catastrophic).I fully recommend checking out Sonic Adventure 2. It's one of those games that I feel shows off what an action platforming game should be like. It might very well be the best 3D Sonic game that we're ever going to get at this point in time."

Hundreds of hours invested (mostly with the Chao Garden) and it seems like the game as a whole is near perfect in its components. Only way to honestly make it any better would be either making the entire system an open world (rather than just the Chao Garden) and/ or allowing you to be able to personalize in game characters. Although, not having the personal customization is focused around the fact that there are many different characters with all their diferent attributs as well as special upgrades they can all attain. The story at first seems very short but it's not to be confused with it's difficulty in regards to making God type Chao such as the Devil chao or the heavenly chao, or with all the medals you are able to have. Having a final bonus stage as well made me want to grind for all those ""A ranks"" and see beyond the end of the story line. Absolutely awesome game and I have already recommended this title to many of my friends in the past as well as present."
,Recommended,213610,9368634,"Posted: 6 March, 2014",all,Pywackett-Barchetta,"The dialogue is ridiculous. The plot is preposterous. The game? Is incredibly fun.I had originally played this game before playing Sonic Adventure, which didn't hamper the experience at all. In hindsight, however, this game highlights and hones three of the best-loved gameplay styles of SA1: Sonic's mad dashes to the finish, E102's missle-filled combat platforming, and Knuckles' treasure-hunting. The physics for the characters feel quite improved, with Sonic and Shadow especially having more of a fast and flighty movement to them. The Homing Attack returns, Light Dash is now a single button press (SUCH AN IMPROVEMENT YOU WON'T FREAKIN' BELIEVE IT), and rail grinding makes its series debut, thanks to the (now-absent: all billboards are replaced) sponsorship of Soap Shoes.The screwy architecture makes a beautiful comeback, but instead of having several characters go through the same levels, each character has their own unique levels set in the same basic locations, including ancient pyramids, a space colony, and a beautifully warped caricature of San Francisco. This expansion comes at the cost of narrowing the field of story modes to two (and a third for a finale), with characters' rivals sharing their same style of gameplay. However, every single level in the story has four extra missions to play through on it, mostly following the formula of collecting 100 rings, finding a lost Chao in the level, a timed run, or Hard Mode.There are plenty of little extras to go for, and incredibly beneficial upgrades for the curious and eagle-eyed players to root out. (You'll want to find the Air Necklace before you play the Last Story.) Attentive players from the original may notice other little details off here, like some absent bench ads, changed upgrade names, and little odds and ends like that. But overall, it's quite the faithful adaptation.I say adapation because this is a full-fledged HD port. If your computer can't run games like Sonic Generations at decent speed, you're better off emulating it, because this really does clean the game up quite nicely for modern standards. The widescreen, improved draw distance, and general attention to detail makes it easy to forget this was a Dreamcast game, and I had a notable bit of slow-down on my computer, but it isn't a gaming machine.Of course, I'm gushing over it because I loved this game as a kid, and it stands the test of time. It will get on your nerves if you're a completionist, with some cheap one-hit-kills in a boss battle or two and some A-Ranks being damn near impossible to get, but if you just want to enjoy a fast-paced platformer with attitude and you don't mind having to restart a few boss battles, I can't recommend this enough.(Note: I am way too connected to my Chao on SA2:B to try setting up a new garden, so I have no word on the port of the Chao Garden on this game.

Whether you ran down that road from the truck on GameCube, Dreamcast, or have not yet run it, Sonic Adventure 2 is a wonderful ride. However, it should not be considered a PERFECT game. Like any early 3D era game, it was bound to have its flaws. The engine is just a bit rickety, and doesn't QUITE live up to today's standards. But look, if you can learn the game, and work past the glitches and flaws, you'll find a beautiful little game that you'll enjoy. It's no life-changing experience, but it's definitely worth playing through just to see that there's fun to be had in a glitchy game. That said, Sonic Adventure 2 gets a 7/10.

The Chao Garden is almost as good as the core game itself (many would argue it's better). A side game so good it should of spawned a well made spin-off by now.Besides the extras though there are plenty of enjoyable levels to play in SA2, however a lot of the missions that don't involve Sonic or Shadow can be very tedious or boring, barring a few decent ones. The hedgehog levels make the game worthwhile overall though and it just about stands the test of time as still a pretty decent game to whip out now and then."

The chao garden is definitely one of the best things to come out of that generation of consoles.However, to take my nostalgic goggles off, the game really hasn't aged well at all. I was almost taken aback by just how ugly the models are in this game, and some of them dialogue is very cringe worthy.My only problem with the PC version is that there's this weird glitch on the City Escape level where the tram train you can knock over at the end of the street boarding section will hover over you constantly and follow you around to the end of the level. I attempted to fix the patches but to no avail, and it doesn't seem to happen to my friend who owns the same version either.Sonic Adventure 2 definitely stands as one of the last Sonic games that were 'good', though Sega have been getting better in the past few years with Sonic Generations. But if you aren't a fan of the series and haven't played it already, I'd suggest playing the original Sonic games (Sonic 1, 2 and Sonic & Knuckles) if you want your fill of 'old Sonic'. The Adventure games likely won't sit well unless you're nostalgic about them as I am."

They're horrible... the voice acting and presentation are better than the previous game by a lot, but because reasons, the characters interrupt themselves when talking, and this happens very frequently. the CGI cutscenes look fine for the characters themselves and the background, but the citizens look, dare I say it, kinda scary.Sonic Adventure 2 has 3 different styles: Sonic/Shadow-High speed action Tails/Eggman-Mech shooting and Knuckles/Rouge- Treasure huntingSonic and shadow are the best part of the game, theyre gameplay is AWESOME. Its the sonic we all know and love running through loops, collecting rings, killing robots, lots of good stuff.Tails and Eggman have the worst style, but I still enjoy it. These two decided to hop on a mech and that's the gameplay but its fun to f*ck sh*t up in it, see a robot? BLOW IT, see a retroactive bomb? BLOW IT, see a nuclear weapon?...Leave it alone cause if you BLOW IT you're gonna die. The part that makes it the worst are the controls, its very stiff.Knuckles and Rouge have treasure hunting, and while I like it, that sh*t can take some time, A LOT of time. The controls are similar to Sonic and Shadow so its great.In the end, this game has some BIG flaws (But at least Big the Cat is not playable [get it? BIG flaws?]) but its very fun to play if you're into it, if you like Sonic, or platformers in general, its very worth your time and money, give it a shot, you won't regret it."

This port of the game has a very bad glitch in the first stage were the truck that chases you later on in the stage is hovering above your head during the beginning of the stage. It seems to only happen to PC's with Intel HD Graphics 4000. There has not been any sort of patch or fix since its been released on Steam and it is very dissapointing. The game itself is great but buy it on PSN or XBOX Live if you can instead. No bugs on those ports.

But Sonic Adventure was really hard for me to like. I mean everything made the game look great. The story was average, the soundtrack was awesome, the graphics were amazing for a dreamcast game (even though this is PC), and the animations were nice and fluint. But the Gameplay totally ruined it, first off I like the new upgrade to the chao garden. But Sonic and Shadow BARLY get any attention in this game. Knuckles and Rouge's levels are very boring, it sucked in Sonic Adventure 1 but at least it was a little fun, I had no fun at all playing in Knuckles and Rouge's levels, it was even more boring and tideous than Adventure 1. Oh and don't even get me started with Tails and Eggman, their levels are BORING, TEDIOUS, AND HORRIBLE. Good lord the controls for them are both blood puking awful, and the levels are extreamly boring. Shadow and Sonic are the only two decent playable charecters, but their levels arn't as fun as Sonic Adventure one's levels. And the worst thing in the game is the last story. People say Sonic06's last story was bad. THIS IS SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO HORRIBLE! The only thing good in the gamplay was the boss fights and that's it. I can't reccommend this to anyone. I don't think it holds up as much as other Sonic titles do. But if you are a long time sonic fan then I GUESS you can like this game. But personally I don't like it.

However, the tails/eggman stages and the knuckles/rouge are boring and just badly designed sometimes. The space levels for knuckles/rouge. These range from fun to just awful. If you're unlucky (like I was) the space levels for knuckles and rouge could take 10-15 minutes, far too long for this kind of game. I don't understand why they HAD to try to push 3 different games into one, which is what it feels like instead of just sticking to one and making it good. The most fun I had was after beating the game once and then just playing the fun stages (aka the sonic and shadow stages) from the free play mode. And honestly, even these stages are far from the 3D sonic stages. I can honestly say that the 3D stages in sonic generations are way better in terms of design. In short, 1/3 of the game is fun. But the music  is good and the fun stages are just that, fun. And seeing how this games costs so little I would say give it a shot if you like this kind of game.

But it was one I wanted to play since the moment I heard about it.  and I love it, well worth the wait for me.I'll start with controls, they were easy enough for me to pick up.  well, minus the mech stages, but I'll come to that.  The controls for Sonic and Shadow are perfect, I'd much prefer to play with these controls than the controls in Unleashed to Generations.  the treasure hunting?  just like the Knuckles levels in Sonic Adventure, so I won't complain.The speed stages are amazing.  Part of it might be bias, due to Shadow being my favorite character and Sonic being my second, but I really enjoyed them.  fast paced like you'd expect from a Sonic game and well designed to accheive that speed.  My one complaint?  not enough of them.  Not so much Sonic, we saw a bit of him, but Shadow really sufferd from this.  Part of this might be ""Shadow is amazing, why isn't there more of him"" but it's true, he only had five stages at most.  though, he featured heavily in the Dark cut scenes, and he was the Dark character who showed up in the most Hero cut scenes.Now, on to the less liked parts of the game.  Treasure hunting...  I hate these levels, because they were always time consuming.  I found they were slightly overused, but there's nothing much that can be said but the radar wasn't as good as SA1.The mech...  Now, this was the game mode I dislike the most.  They're like E-102's levels without the interesting mechanics.  the novelty of playing as an Eggman robot was the best thing about E-102, and while some of that is present in playing as Eggman himself, Tails' mech levels were horrible.  This may sound weird, but Tails felt clunkier in controls and slower (it's a Sonic game, for crying out loud, it's played for speed!)  I honestly would have prefered to play Tails like he was in SA1.  Maybe without the racing, but the flying around and the interesting platforming that came of it.  Playing as Tails in the Tornado 2 just didn't do it for me.Now I don't have much to say about Chao gardens, I found them to be overrated and I'd prefer to be running around as Shadow.  That said, I see why they're attractive.Above all my favorite part of the game was the story.  I love the characters, and (despite the cheesy voice acting) they were done amazingly.  Also, I actually liked the darker feel.  I agree that it wasn't well don in Sonic '06, but this was different.  Yeah, there were more plot holes than a Moffat written Doctor Who episode, but I found they left room for imagination, and I really enjoyed coming up with head canon to fill them.All in all, I like it.  The ending is one of the few moments in fiction that made me cry, and the introduction of Shadow made it even better for me.  I'd recommend it to Sonic fans, but maybe not a non fan.  9/10"

The mechs are treasure finding ESPECIALLY in later stages can just screw off.My main complain is control of Sonic and Shadow at high speeds... sometimes the turn just seems like ""welp, that's a thing"" and the camera can be abit buggy (even when  played on Dreamcast) ...The Mech stages aren't fun for me overall. Nothing too bad about them its just not for me.Treasure finding in this game was just crazy especially when having to look for pieces in a completely different part of the stage (like in Rouge's story) and later on the meteor stages shouldn't even have to be a thing, especially when all that gravity is in play and I'm spending 20 minutes looking for pieces that are in front of me and aren't notifying me. Fix your game Blizzard Ent. (hue hue hue hue hue)I don't play a game much for the story so I have no input on the story's matter but in this case its more-so based on the past rather than what happened in SA1.Enemy placement can be GAWD AWFUL a lot of the times but,.. well there's no but its just gawdawful.The placements where there is literally not even 0.01 seconds to react, you're gonna get hit unless you know what to do but if its your first time, trust me you're going to get hit.Overall I'd say 7/10 and yea I'd still recommend this game especially if you're a fan of the series (but not Sonic '06 >_> offtopic)If the character control was better, literally just the control (this would include the gravity in the Meteor stages) was better I'd say 9/10"

If you want to truly enjoy all that this game has to offer, buy the Gamecube version.Simply put, the game is buggy as all hell on PC, and multiple features are implemented but deny the player access do to SEGA's gimmick feature for GBA connectivity in the Chao garden (pet raising sim portion of the game).  Speaking of the Chao garden, in the PC version (in addition to features that were meant for the GBA/GCN) you cannot grow trees, they literally bug out and only grow halfway (both reducing the number of extra trees you can have and never producing fruit).  Due to this, raising Chao is a futile effort of tying them down and force feeding them the same hated basic foods over and over again, or farming thousands of rings in order to buy all the fruit you need to raise their stamina to acceptable levels.

,Recommended,213610,11457505,"Posted: 28 July, 2014",all,Hollifer,"Pretty fun compared to most 3D Sonic games.Good things I can say about it:1.Controls - This game, unlike many other sonic games, actually gives you freedom with the controls. Whenever I play any other sonic games but the SA series I feel like i'm not...well, playing. A forward gravatational pull and inability to walk sideways quickly as if you are on a set path really bothers me. I guess I could say they feel quick and precise in SA2B, and laggy and slow in others. (you can recover very quickly back to full speed)2. Stages/Gamemodes - I find many of the stages from SA and SA2 to be very colorful, inspiring and overall pleasing to run through and/or explore. The different game modes may make or break your good feelings about the game. There are 3 modes: Running stages, gem hunts, and shooting stages. Personally I adore all of them, and I feel that it really balances out the game, and challenges you a bit.3. Music - Stuff that pumps you up and inspires you even after you've stopped playing. Each boss and stage's song is specifically crafted to match the theme and are all very unique. Oh, and      LIVE AND LEARN!Not-so-good things about it:There are some things  that could be much better about the game. The length of the game is relatively short. While most games have you playing 20+ hours from start to finish, SA2 even while watching all cutscenes, will only take about 6 or 7 hours. There also isn't much to acheive after you've beat the game. Sure you can go on your 180 emblemhunt, but truthfully it isn't worth it just for the green hill zone. I've been playing the game since I was very young and only until I was 13 that I collected everything--mostly because of CHAO rasing (it is time consuming as hell). Voice acting could be better and I do NOT know what the creators were thinking when they designed Mission Street (stage) for Tails.Overall I still believe it is a good pick, and DEFINITELY a classic in my heart."

This was the most cinematic Sonic game at the time, and, unlike some other story-driven Sonic games, this one took its time, and eventually was regarded as a masterpiece. This game adds HD support and widescreen to an already brilliant game, but don't fill themm with updated models and textures. They're cleaned up, but still resemble the original game. The only downfall is that the game can only detect XBox 360 controllers, and the keyboard controls aren't too good. If you use another gamepad, such as Logitech, use JoytoKey and set your input threshold to 80% (you'll thank me later). This game was my childhood, and seeing it hold up well to most of today's AAA titles is amazing.

The game still has some bugs however and should be handled with care, many of which will show their head in final chase/rush.The game play of the ""adventure"" series has always been varied, sonic being speed, knuckles beingtreasure hunting etc. This one is no different but with the twist that you can play as both the heroes and villians of the story who all play as mirrors of each other. These end up mirrors in gameplay to each other. sonic = shadow, tails = eggman, knuckles = rouge. while this isn't absolutely horrible, the sameness may leave you desiring more and since story is always been kinda a laugh in Sonic games, the story wont really be a huge motivator to push through the sameness. Another problem with this game it was part of the era where sega thought super should remain exclusive to sonic and it be cinematic only. You cannot go super in any of the ordinary stages which is a serious no fun allowed feeling.This game was also the last of the games to have one of the greatest addictions of that era: chao. Chaos were an addicting tamogachi like pet system that one could lose hours of their life playing around with, Adventure 2 had the most expanded upon chao garden and thus the most features.For replayablilty there is alot to do: chaos, finding hidden powerups, going for all A ranks and emblems. There's plenty one can do to keep entertained. In all I highly recommend this game because it was one of the last good main series sonic games until Sonic Generations."

Yes, even surpassing Generations (which WAS a good game, don't get me wrong!).Sonic Adventure 2 has a story that's kind of aged into something that's pretty cheesy, but is still enjoyable and has enough depth to sort of keep you interested. The basic plot is that Sonic has been framed for a string of crimes going on throughout the city, and he's been taken into custody by the military. However, Sonic breaks lose, and it's up to him and his friends to figure out what's going on.That's the Hero's side of the story....On the Dark side of the story, Eggman has unleashed a top-secret weapon that his grandfather was working on....And stuff happens. Both stories end up tying into one another pretty nicely, and you're encouraged to play both sides of the story to get the full deal.Yes, the game is divided into two stories. One is Hero (Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles), and the other is Dark (Shadow, Eggman, and Rouge). You're free to start anyone you like. Personally, I found the Dark story to be more enjoyable because playable Dr. Eggman, but that's just my opinion.The game is divided into three different types of gameplay: Sonic and Shadow's stages, which are speed stages and arguably the best of the bunch, Tails' and Eggman's stages, which are pretty fun destruction stages, and lastly Knuckles' and Rouge's stages, which are the...okay, stages in which you must search for three items hidden around the stage.Sonic and Shadow's stages are pretty much more or less the same as what we saw from Sonic's stages from SA1, but with slightly tighter physics. They're high speed, and you're encouraged to get to the goal. That's all that matters in these stages. Of course, you can destroy G.U.N.'s robots or collect rings to gather more points, which in the end will grant you a better score in the end, and thus a better rank at the end of the stage (which is important for some achievements and...other surprises).Tails' and Eggman's stages are the slowest of the bunch, but a nice break from Sonic and Shadow's stages. These ones are more destruction based, and mostly require you to shoot robots using your missles or the lock-on cannon, the latter giving you more points if you lock on to multiple enemies at once. Also unique to this mode is that both Tails and Eggman have a health bar in their stage. Obviously, if it depletes, you lose a life, but you can collect rings to refill it (though they aren't as abundant as they are in say Sonic and Shadow's stages).Lastly, there's Knuckles' and Rouge's stages. In these ones, you have to find three items hidden around the stage (these items vary from Master Emerald shards, to keys, to Chaos Emeralds, though it all depends on what stage it is). Your goal is to use your radar to find the pieces, or use the computer monitor hints to help you find them (though you're limited to three hints per item, the last hint usually blatantly telling you where it is). The faster you find them and less hints you use, the better your score is for recovering one item. These stages start out reasonable enough due to them being big in size, but not so big you feel helplessly lost. However, halfway through the game, these stages become rather tedious. They're usually so big that you're going to have trouble figuring out where you are and where the items are, and even the third ""giveaway"" computer hint won't help you much. By the end of both the Hero and Dark storylines, you'll be happy to have those nightmares out of the way.There's also the Chao Garden, which is easily the best feature of the game. Chao are little creatures that live in the Chao Garden, which is seperate from the rest of the game. You can collect Chaos Drives in the games main stages along with small animals, and give them to these creatures. Doing this alters their looks, and also levels them up. You can then enter them in races (and Chao Karate if you bought the DLC), and win emblems or toys for your Chao to use. Sadly, if you're aiming for 100 percent, you DO have to participate in the Chao Garden snce the emblems awarded at the end of the races are needed for 100 percent, so this can be seen as a downside if you aren't interested in the Chao Garden and you're aiming to just finish the game.Overall:Pros:- Sonic and Shadow's stages offer some nice high speed gameplay with the point and rank system also encouraging platforming.- Tails and Eggman's stages, while slower, are still a pretty fun break from Sonic and Shadow's stages.- Knuckles and Rouge's first few stages are pretty good.- The Chao Garden is a lot more fun than you'd expect it to be.- Cheesy vocals in a couple of the game's tracks that are kind of fun to listen to.-A pretty decent two player mode, though nothing spectacular.- The Kart racing mini-game you unlock is pretty fun.Cons:- Knuckles' and Rouge's later stages aren't all that fun. They're incredibly big and annoying to navigate (Mad Space will make you want to cry).- The Hero and Dark stories require you to switch between the three types of gameplay, which some may not like.- The additional GameCube content that was added into Battle is sold as DLC. To get Chao Karate and the GameCube intro you need that DLC.TL;DR - Gotta Chao Garden"

Just finished the story mode and I have died more times than I can count due to falling through walls and floors, bad homing attacks, poor level design, and all sorts of other things. For every death that was actually my fault, I probably died five times due to the game. Hell, even the original Sonic Adventure was less glitchy than this game. The reason that Mario came out on top and Sonic didn't was because the Mario games didn't invoke this level of frustration.If you've never played this game before, expect quality that was standard for the time. Voice acting was good, though the writing was terrible. Graphics have actually aged less than expected. I still love the music to this game too. Live and Learn is great. I also really like Escape from the City as well. Just try not to throw your controller or punch a wall after your 50th death.Unless you're a diehard Sonic fan, stay away from this game. Instead, try playing the 2D games instead, or the newer 3D games. They're... slightly better. Except Sonic '06. NO ONE SHOULD PLAY SONIC '06."

One of my favorite Sonic games out there, up there with Sonic Unleashed, Adventure DX, and Generations. If you are a Sonic fan, definitely check Adventure 2 out. (Unless you're one of those picky Sonic fanboys, who hate every Sonic game that isn't on the Genesis.) Anyway, you can customize the controls to your liking (My preferred controls are WASD to move around, SPACE to jump, and SHIFT to use a certain ability depending on which character you are playing as.) In this game there are 3 stories: Hero, Dark, and Last Story. There are three different gameplay styles: Speed stages, Shooting stages, and Treasure hunting stages. The Speed stages are for Sonic and Shadow, the Shooting stages are for Tails and Eggman, and the Treasure hunting stages are for Knuckles and Rouge. (There's also another gameplay style that's introduced at the end, but I'm not going to spoil anything, so you'll have to find out yourself!), along with Boss stages. I ADORE the Speed stages. They are amazingly well-designed, and every bit of them is entertaining to run through. I guess the Shooting stages are okay, too, but they can be boring at times. However, one of the things I hate about this game are some of the Treasure hunting stages. Since the emerald pieces spawn randomly, you never know where to look, and the levels can drag on for up to THIRTY MINUTES *Cough cough* Death Chamber *Cough cough*. The boss stages, however, are AMAZING. I especially love the Egg Golem fight with Sonic, the King Boom Boo fight with Knuckles, and yes, even the extremely hard Biolizard and Finalhazard boss fights. I don't have much more to say, as the story is quite long and I can't explain it all in this quick review, so I'll leave it at this. If you like Sonic games, get this game.

It's not just the nostolgia goggles either, I find myself replaying SA2 all the time because of it's fun gameplay.  A lot of people complain about how this was the downfall of the Sonic franchice, but I disagree. You're able to play as the hero and dark stories,  and both of them are more or less the same concepts with different characters and levels. Sonic and shadow are traditional ""gotta go fast"" levels, get from point A to point B, avoiding enemies and other hostile objects. Most of the stages are well thought out and genuinely fun to play through.People seem to hate on Knuckles and Rouge's levels. But I enjoy them. It's basically a hunt for 3 chaos emeralds or keys. You're given an open level to explore and find them. Level design saves this otherwise tedious sounding task. Every level is different and utilizes new physics and actions as you progress.My least favorite type is the Tails / Eggman levels. You're basically going from point A to B in a big robot walker that can shoot lasers. It's not really that bad, and these are more puzzle solving levels, but sometimes these levels drag on for a little too long.Raising Chao are fun, but it's not nessisarry unless you want to 100% the game or get achivements.The presentation is all awesome, the soundtrack is absolutely wonderful. Especially the Knuckles stage rap music. The lyrics are a bit silly, but the beats are downright fresh to death. The visuals are colorful and attractive, and the art design fits well (besides the humans in the game, they just seem out of place.)SA2 is a much more polished version of SA1. They are both fun games, but I prefer to play SA2. This game is also in HD, which is rad.Now for a little critisim:1. The story is kinda lame. Go figure, it's about a blue hedgehog.2. The voice acting is cheeeeeesey. It's not game ruining, it's actually quite funny and you'll get more than a few laughs.3. Like SA1, this game has it's share of glitches, some more frustrating than others, but not as many as SA1.4. Beating the game itself isn't that difficult, but getting all the emblems is almost torture."

The shooting levels are pretty good too.Graphics are...well they're DC graphics, what do you really expect?

The music is probably the best soundtrack amongst the Sonic games, and you'll probably spend ages just listening to the soundtrack within the game.Also. CHAO GARDEN. IF YOU DO NOT FIND THE DAMN CHAO ADORABLE, YOU HAVE A PROBLEM.Cons: The Camera is very finicky and twitchy, either getting stuck on walls or changing to very extreme and weird angles for no reason whatsoever. Not unbearable but definitely a nuisance.Story to Gameplay integration is very odd...you'll question how you've gone from one level to the next so quickly, with NO CUTSCENE explaining how that's come about.Cutscenes have borders on the sides of the screen. No clue why that is seeing as the borders aren't properly finished at the tops. You can clearly tell that they're being rendered beyond those borders, so there's no reason not to have the cutscenes in fullscreen.So yeah, all in all, great game, worth the purchase, and if I'm able to edit this review I'll do so with the Battle DLC.

To be honest, I dont like it all that much,I dont like the way the game looks (i prefer Sonic Adventures models) Audio-wise, On paper it stands to reason I should not like Sonic Adventure 2 within any way.But Ill start by getting to the elephant within the room first - If you are running ""Intel"" of any description, you willNOTenjoy this title, It will run within slow-mo. I dont mean,Oh it runs a bit slow, I mean City Escape (first time through) took me 50 Real-Time Minutes to complete - Slow-mo.There is currently no fix for this, And from this basis alone - I dont recommend this particular version. As I am one of the unfortunate few who run Intel. However, ignoring that and the super slow-mo gameplay. Lies what is arguably a generally mixed whether this could be considered better or worse compared to the original.Within the original some of the levels are shared by multiple characters, accomidating for many different playstyles, with as little level alterations as possible. This lead to an issue where the levels are not talored to suit every character entirely.Sonic Adventure 2 features character specific levels, Sonic remains within the high-speed action stages, Knuckles remains within his treasure hunting stages and tails has been religated to a mech. On the reverse side of things, the original adventure had stories talored to each character, Involving you able to choose the gameplay style that you want to play with arguably, more levels.Meaning if you are not someone who enjoys Knuckles stages, or you just wanted to play as sonic without any other characters, Adventure 2 will annoy you - as your forced to play other characters during the storyline. But for the most part the level designs are better than the original. With one or two small gripes.- Upgrades - You have to find them in the levels. Within the original game, you had to find them within an overworld, which for the most part, most of these were optional, And not that difficult to find. Within here, they can be a pain especially considering you have to find them in order to progress - e.g. light shoes, - Music, To alot of people, the music does not matter all that much. But what made sonic and the original adventure was the soundtrack, Which was as varied as it can be, With there literally being only one or two within the same genre of music. Within Adventure 2, its mostly rock, and the music is more talored towards the characters rather than the levels. As with Knuckles, you end up hearing rap music, whilst sonics is heavily fast - rock music.As someone who likes rock, this might sound like nick-picking, I just think sonic titles should have a good variety of music. But the music overall is alright, Dispite the lack of overall variety.Something that could be considered to be an issue within the original was - If you wanted to beat the game, you needed to complete 6 stories, Within Adventure 2 its streamlined to two seperate stories. Hero and Dark.Hero - Consisting of Sonic (speed), Tails (Mech) and Knuckles (hunting treasure)Dark - Consisting of Shadow (speed) Dr Eggman (Ivo Robotnik - Mech) and Rouge (hunting treasure)The gameplay styles are taking from the original adventure, however the levels are more focused on that particular gameplay style and overall the levels are better designed for that particular character. The only real things to mension here is If you have played Sonic adventure as sonic - Speed is exactly the same.Mech - Basically the same, but with a number of - enemy appears before you with 1 second to react enemies which can get annoying.Treasure hunting - they have somewhat ruined this entirely to the point I would say its almost not fun. the game selects a item for you and you have to find that particular item (out of 3) if you find either the second or third pieces, the game will not tell you your anywhere near any of the other pieces. Purely because it is not that one item it wants you to get.Cutscenes are awkward - the storyline falls appart when you start thinking about anything, But then you dont play a sonic title for a storyline. Your in for it with the idea of speed which the game can deliver.All things considered Adventure 2 is a title I would say, you can forget about - However if it interests you, by all means pick it up. It can be fun, Just dont expect a huge number of hours to go into this, you will either get right into it or you wont.As for DLC - ""Battle"" If you skip getting it, you essentially get Sonic Adventure 2 as it was originally released and the ""Battle"" DLC adds multiplayer (locally) I really do not recommend this. Purely because the likely-hood of getting to play a multiplayer game is fairly slim these days, Especially considering this is DLC. Which costs money, that the game probably should have had this in the release to begin with.My verdict, skip the Battle DLC, if you have nothing else to play or want to try and get into some older titles. Adventure 2, I would recommend after the original Adventure. Purely because it feels like sonic - But in 3D. Adventure 2, is lets try making a 3D sonic title, without trying to retain all the classic-ness the original had in relation to the original titles."

I liked this game so much that even though I have the game on my Gamecube I got it again on Steam for convenience.There are 3 types of gameplay. Sonic/Shadow fast paced racing/platforming levels; Knuckles/Rouge crystal hunting challenges; and Tails/Dr. Eggman’s robotic shooter levels. There is also the Chao raising minigame that seems simple at first then you realize it’s unbelievably complicated. The game is simple enough that I was able to beat it as a child but it’s challenging enough that I have yet to complete the game to its entirety even as an adult.If you have two controllers I find the multiplayer to be fun too.
,Recommended,213610,9406384,"Posted: 9 March, 2014",all,BAJAMBLES,"My favorite Sonic game. I grew up on this so I might be a little biased but here it goes: The controls for this game are♥♥♥♥♥♥ lets get that out of the way. Getting your character to do, or in some cases, not do things can be frustrating and funny at the same time. That being said I have found that the clunky controls are managable and after some practice they aren't too bad. As far as gameplay goes you are able to play as the Hero side and Dark side of the same story. The Hero Side (Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles) are trying to stop Eggman and collect the shards of the master emeralds. The Dark Side (Shadow, Eggman, and Rougue) are trying to collect the master emerald shards for Eggman's next evil plan. The campaign is fun and changing out characters and mechanics helps the game to not feel too repetitive (there is still a lot of repetition though). Anyway, what this game is really about Chao. If you don't know what Chao are I'll try and explain: Chao are little creatures that the player reises and then can use to compete in either races or karate. Chaos have 5 stats Swim, Fly, Run, Power, and Stamina. Every enemy you defeat drops ""Chao Drives"" which are just sxp in one of the stats above, alternativley you can find small animals in campaign levels to also give to your Chao for slightly more stat boosts, in multiple stats as well. Chaos can evolve change shape size and color, they have affection and hatred, they get hungry, you can send them to school, plus they are damn cute. Thsi game should be called Chao Adventure 2. 8/10"

This isn't your classic side-scrolling Sonic game, but it still has the basic ring collecting and speed elements. There are two different story modes to play through, one on the good side (Playable characters include Sonic, Tails, Knuckles), and one on the bad side (Playable characters include Shadow, Eggman, Rouge). With all these stages alongside minigames and one of my personal all-time favourite features, Chao Garden, there is plenty to do and so I'd say it is worth a play."

Voiceacting is terrible, and the lipsyncing is trash. And the levels...EW. The first few are fun, but then when you get to the pyramid stages in the HERO side everything goes down. I haven't even played DARK yet, but I assume it's as bad as HERO is, if not even worse. And even before the pyramid, there are obvious problems. First of all, the story is barely feasible, and some of the stages are absoulutely atrocious, even in the early game. The knuckles stages start off easy at first, but near the end they drag on, and I found myself spending up to 15 minutes trying to complete them, with plenty of restarts to get more understandable clues. In metal harbor, the section with the homing attack was almost impossible, too. However, you can blame those two things on my lack of skill. What I don't think you could possibly blame me on is some of the game's level design. I haven't even finished HERO yet, and I can still see the obvious problems with the levels. Take, for instance, Crazy Gadget. At one point in the stage, you have to jump onto a grind rail to get past a huge pit. This wouldn't be too much of a problem if you didn't have to stop and line yourself up with the rail before getting on it first. This is aHUGEproblem in a game focusing on speed, however. I found myself missing this rail time after time, and I still haven't completed the stage. And if you're still not convinced, I'll give you a list of other things that are wrong in the game.A lot of the characters have annoying voicesThe president in the game barely does ANYTHING at all, while a speedy blue hedgehog with limbs and his friends do practically ALL of the work for his countryGame is too overpriced for what it isThe default keyboard controls are terrible, making this game essentially neccessary to play by using a gamepad or Steam controllerThe camera is terrible, along with many other things in the gameThere's evenmorethings that this game does wrongEssentialy, there are only a handful of good things in this game. A few of the stages are fun and easy, sticking to the traditional pacing of Sonic games. But by far, Chao Garden is the best part of the game. The Garden is the most wellmade thing in this whole game.Final StandingsThis game is mostly bad. Like I said, the best part is Chao Garden, and not most of the actual game itself. 4/10. I would reccomend getting it on sale or just winging it and getting it on an emulator.Hah, I'm gonna get roasted for this, aren't I?"

Sonic pulling off chaos control for the first time. Don't know why, but sure. The speed levels are by far the best in my opinion with their nice rock music and fun level design. They have the occasional puzzle thrown in there to stop you for a second, but it's mainly just speed. Oh and Sonic's in that, so automatic win. The mech shooters are kinda boring and control like a tank. You also have a health bar instead of rings, but rings help fill up the bar. You can lock on to multiple targets and shoot a ton of missles everywhere too. These are alright, but get repetetive. The treasure hunting stages are by far, my least favorite. I don't hate then, but I don't like them either (except for Rouge's security hall which can go screw itself). You're collecting three emeralds in a stage and that's it. The big problem here is how big the levels are. Especially the later space levels. You also have a radar that tells you close you are to the next emerald (gray is nowhere near, green is in the area, yellow is closer, red is very close, and the exclamation mark means you're within 2 feet of it). The problem with this is it only tells you the next emerald it wants you to find. So you could walk right by an emerald and not know because that's not the one it wanted you to find. Security Hall also has a time limit of 5 minutes to collect the emeralds. This level's fairly small, but that time limit is pressuring. The Chao Garden. I love this place. You start out with two eggs and hatch them with 3 methods. Throwing it, shaking it, and just letting it hatch. You get a hero or dark chao by raising it with one of the respective characters or beating it up with the opposite ones, but why would you wanna do that? :c After getting a hero or dark chao, you obtain the hero and dark gardens respectively. You also have a daycare where they can learn different things such as drawing, singing, playing an intrument, etc. A doctor who can tell you what your chaos' weaknesses and strengths are, what they like to eat, and other info. The principal gives you some tips on how to raise your chao and there's a black market where you can buy fruit, seeds, and other goodies for your chao. There's also a fortune teller who can name your chao or (by decling all her names) you can name it yourself! There's chao racing and chao karate is you got the DLC. I could go into even more detail, but that'd take way too long (possible guide?). There are also 2P battles you can have! Races, mech fights, and race to emeralds are all things you can do! Locally. Unless you got a certain mod. *cough*SA2BN*cough* All in all this game is great, but the chao garden and speed levels are all I 100% enjoyed. If you're getting into Sonic, pick it up. I'm sure you'll like it. Not into Sonic? Get a demo, then see what ya think. Diehard fan? How have you not played it once? For real though. I love dis game. c:"

Since then it has been a fans favorite.Pros:- Overall nice plot- Long playtime- Chao garden- Smooth controlls- Great soundtrack- New likeable charactersCons:- Side character stages are only average- Clunky camera- Not well ageing graphics- No online multiplayer or chao tradeStory:This game takes place after Sonic Adventure. Eggman releases the ultimate lifeform ""Shadow"" to help him steal all the seven Chaos Emeralds. Of course it is up to Sonic and his friends again to stop Eggman and save the world.The story is seperated into the ""Hero"" and ""Dark"" side.In this game Shadow the Hedgehog and Rouge the Bat were first introduced. In each one of these you will play three diffrent characters who each have their own little story that ties into the overal plot of the game.Playstyles:Unlike in Sonic Adventure, SA2 does not have a world hub but a world map where you can choose which stage you want to play next or revisit.All 6 characters are split into three diffrent play styles.Speed stages are avaiable for Sonic and Shadow, Shoot 'em up stages for Tails and Eggman and the Treasure Hunt stages for Knuckles and Rouge. After each stage you complete you get rewarded with an rank and the rings you collected in the level.For me the best stages are the speed stages. Sonic and Shadow feel very natural while playing and they are nicely designed with great music and a very fast pace. Then there are the Shoot 'em up ones wich I don't like as much. They break the fast pace of the game similar to the Werehog in Unleashed.I do like the Treasure Hunting stages. They are huge and I spend a long time exploring all of them. Also these stages have some of my favorite songs.Only problem with the Treasure Hunting is that they changed the radar system from SA and you can only search one shard of the Chaos Emerald. It's pretty frustrating to back track through whole levels to get all three of them and sometimes levels can take ages since some of them are huge and they tale ages to get an A-Rank. (*sigh* Meteor Herd)Also you have the Chao Garden and the racing minigames.Controls:I would reccomend playing with a controller.I would say that SA2 has the best controls of every 3D Sonic game right now.The camera can be a bit clunky but overall okay and even if you play the speed sections you never feel like you are not in control of Sonic or Shadow.The controls for the Shoot 'em up and Treasure Hunting sections are are very diffrent. Of course you have to walk around but you will have much more jumping and hovering and many enemys you have to clear out of the way.Treasure Hunting doesn't have a linear design. You can fly around and explore and dig for treasures and the missing shards of the Chaos Emerald. You have a radar to help you locate all pieces hidden in the level and tips you can get from various flying TV's all around the level.Sound:The voice acting is average but the music is one of the best Sonic soundtracks.Each song fits it's level perfectly. There is a huge variety in genres too. Knuckles has many Rap songs where as Rouge has soft RnB like songs. Sonic, Tales and Eggman got rock songs while Shadow has some a bit darker rock songs with electronic influences.Chao Garden:One of my favorite parts of the game is the Chao Garden. Here you can raise little creatures called the Chaos. Each level you will play will have little animals running around or hidden somewhere. You can collect these and give them to your chao o alter their appearance and increase thir stats. Also enemys drop ""drives"" which also increase Chaos attributes.Chaos can also compete in mini games such as Chao Racing and Chao Karate.I spend hours into leveling and breeding them and raising them and mastering all mini games.Multiplayer:The multiplayer in Sonic Adventure 2 has been always one of my favorites.You can play almost all the levels of the main game together with a friend. Some are shorter than the ingame one but there are many that are full lenght. You can play the speed stages as well as the treausre hunting and shoot ' em up as well as the car racing minigames.Also you can trade Chaos or let them compete against each other in a race or karate.Sadly this is not online on the PC version. You have to have a friend next to you to play the multiplayer. Sadly it's a missed opportunity."

It'd been a while since I played the game and recently viewed walkthroughs made me nostalgic for it, but I didn't expect the amount of trouble this gave me.It feels like they didn't even try to port this game correctly. Having it in full screen mode crashes it. Having the Steam HUD activated crashes it because the game was not re-formatted for it. It took me 3 days of searching the internet to find fixes for my problems since I bought the game already, and spent too much time trying to get myself past the Story Mode screen to quit.After way too much time, I got it to wory, and haven't had any problems since aside from the controller support. If you have a USB xBox 360 controller, you shouldn't have too much of an issue. However the only working USB controller I have is my Ps4 controller. I needed to install InputMapper to use it and trust me, you're gonna want to use a controller for this game. The Keyboard controlls for this game are...not...good.Aside from those issues, once I got it to work, I've been enjoying it ever since. There's a whole bunch of Mods to choose from and it makes the game more entertaining for those that aren't satisfied with mere nostalgia. There's even mods that make raising Chao much less of a grind.TL;DR If you want this game to play it immediately, you're probably better off finding your old Gamecube and getting Sonic Adventure 2 Battle. If you don't mind working for it and dealing with frustration after frustration until it FINALLY behaves, then go right ahead and get this game on Steam."

Not exactly.Sonic Adventure 2 is by no means a bad game, if anything, its a pretty solid game with a lot of fun to be had throughout.However, Sonic Adventure 2 feels very much akin to that of a good 'direct to video sequel' rather than a full fledged follow up to the original Sonic Adventure game.Levels have been stripped down, and it is very rare, especially in Sonic's sections for levels to branch out into multiple pathways and as a result levels are extremely linear. Despite the lack of pathways, levels still manage to be fun, however on repeated playthroughs they become repetitive and boring due to the lack of variation. Sonic also seems to control much stiffer this time around, and the slower spindash removes a lot of opportunities for playing around as well as sequence breaking.Knuckle's treasure hunting stages have also been stripped down; being able to only find one emerald piece at a time is a cheap way of having the levels play out longer, and the mech stages are slow, stiff and do not feels like Sonic at all; and are a huge step back from Gamma's stage from the first Adventure.The story is much more involved however, whilst not amazing; it is fun and perilous. Characters are colourful and there are a ton of memorable moments throughout and the darker tone is balanced nicely.The chao garden is of course a highly regarded element, and I have to agree. It is so easy to lose yourself in this vast virtual pet mini game. There are many types of chao, each with their own personalities and talents. Mini games for them to partake in. Levelling them up and strengthening them to your own liking. It is well structured and well thought out, and the multiple gardens are relaxing and it is a fun way to wind down after playing the main story.Whilst not the best game in the world, Sonic Adventure 2 is definitely a fun platform game; even if somewhat basic and stripped down from the game that came before it."

The plot is simple enough for a child to follow, yet deep enough for an adult to appreciate. The gameplay, while flawed, has some small qualities to it which impress me even now... or perhaps especially now, as modern Sonic games are far too forgiving. The music, as with most Sonic games, is incredible.Probably the biggest failing of this game is the level design.

I was most intrigued by the final story of course, and defeating the biolizard, which as a kid, scared me half to death. I have to say the most fun part, in agreement to most other people, is the chao garden. If you love the chao garden as much as I do, you probably have some shiny two-tones and even some chaos-chao! This game is amazing, but I was a little dissappointed when I learned that this port has a chao skin bug; there is a certain chao skin, I forget exactly which, that turns a very piercing white color instead of being the right thing. This probably affects around 1/4 of the colored chao combinations and it is very saddening, because it feels like it removes part of me from the game. I have asked, as well as many other people, to have it fixed, but no one is willing to do it. It is very unfortunate."

SA1 had Big the Cat, Heroes had a terrible story and repetitive levels, Shadow had Heroes's problems but with poor controls, 06 had the glitches and disgusting plot, Unleashed had the night levels, Colors is an overrated puzzle game with a half-baked story, Generations was too short for a $30.00 game, Lost World pulls the rug under you after World 2, and Boom failed in every department possible (except not having Big the Cat levels).The cutscenes are indeed dubbed over the Japanese version, but this is made up by the fact that this game (and Sonic Adventure DX) are the only Sonic games where everyone has character development, significance to the story, and have rises and falls (meaning that Sonic isn't perfect and Eggman isn't moronic a la Colors or Generations). Despite the natural story flow, the story isn't something that would stand out if it were written in a novel.If you are playing this for the first time, then you should start with the Dark Story. Yep. You can play as the villans, despite the fact that the story changes very little between Hero Story and Dark Story (which I find to be a good thing). The Dark Story starts with a slow level that allows the player to acquaint his or herself with the controls, which is optimal for those not experienced in the controls.If you have already played another 3D Sonic game and are comfortable with the controls and annoying camera, then start with the Hero story to get the satisfying blast of ROLLING AROUND AT THE SPEED OF SOUND. Unfortunately, there is no time to allow the player to stop or adapt to the controls untill halfway through the level. Playing the Hero's first level as a newbie will lead to extreme frustration and an E rank.There are many levels, a ""True Ending"" when you complete both stories, four optional sidequests per level, a Chao Garden (which I didn't fall in love with for some reason), and multiplayer (which I haven't used).This game isn't what I would call a ""must-play""; however, if you are into platformers, then I would recommend this game to you."

If you haven't played it, I find this title to be the measuring stick for all titles succeeding it. Three different play styles were utilized so the action was more broken up. Fast paced action stages starring Sonic and Shadow the hedgehog will have you racing through highway construction zones, military ocean bases, and even the streets of San Francisco. Arcade style shooter levels that will have you chaining homing missiles to defeat military opposition. And treasure hunting missions that will have you searching high and low for shards of the Master Emerald.All in all, I think this game holds up on a gameplay level. The camera is the biggest downfall of the entire experience.On a technical level, however, I am very impressed with this PC port. Eyefinity/Surround support is there, it has gamepad support, and the textures at high resolutions are simply excellent for their age.If it's on sale, or in a bundle, I highly reccommend it.

Probably from when I was a stupid kid with a gamecube who refuses to let go of the past, but does it live up to my child self's expectations? Of course not.As far as I'm concerned, the only good parts of the game are the speedy Sonic and Shadow parts that are over far too quickly. The mech stages are godawful and the scavenger hunts are just. Why? Also the last stage is a nightmare.The mech stages are just tedious and slow, not to mention you might get shot by something you can't even see, and if you're playing on a keyboard and mouse because you're too lazy to switch to a controller (Or don't have one), then expect to die on these stages. A lot.The scavenger hunt stages are just... People enjoy these? You have to find three things and two of the things don't even ding on the bottom part of the screen until you've found the first thing. This ends up with you running around in circles going from place to place to find the first thing, then going back to a place you've ran over five times trying to find the first thing to find the second thing. Repeats with the third. It's just silly.Bosses in the game are pretty fun though. Minus the last Eggman/Tails boss which is just cheap.Chao Garden will eat your life if you don't have one.Music is pretty sick too.If you can push yourself through the agonizing mech/scavenge stages, it's a really fun game to get if you're just obsessed with beating your highest score, but if you're not that patient.

I don't know if it's the port, but it's just barely playable. Also, I played this with a third-party controller, but that caused me to realise that the characters don't have 360 degrees of movement.

,Not Recommended,213610,21952907,"Posted: 20 March, 2016",all,Tim,"It's hard to speak to the depths this game works against itself, especially as a cynical means to artificially increase game time. I'll touch on some specifics.Knuckles and Rouge: their levels are nearly all about verticality, their floorspace often made of tight rooms and tighter corridors with lots of elbows and grounded obstacles. Meanwhile, the speed of their vertical ascent (through climbing) is pitiful, and they can reach near-Sonic speeds with a higher rate of acceleration than the blue blur himself while running on the ground and while gliding through the air. Aside from Pumpkin Hill (a stage strecthed wide with floating islands and littered with rockets for quick ascent), it feels like every stage for them is made AGAINST their design as characters.But, most people might point to the Sonic and Shadow levels as worth the package deal. Well, they're not stellar, either. Alternate paths rarely save you much time or reward you with enough rings or point opportunities to increase your score significantly. Often, you sling back to the main part of the stage in 10 seconds or less; replaying levels differently... doesn't end up much different. Both of their levels are punctuated with sharp stops like Shadow landing from multiple momentum-killing jumps off ramps in his city level, or Sonic having to carry and drop key items or flip gravity switches. The alternate-path hunting roller-coaster ride you look for in a Sonic game is only sometimes present in these levels.A big personal frustration: you have to play optional missions in order. The 4th and 5th missions are things I enjoy: time-limit missions and a hard mode. However, the 3rd mission is always ""Find the Lost Chao"". To find the vast majority, you need a very hard to find persistent upgrade called the ""Mystic Light"", in a different level for each character without guidance. To find the power-up, you'll be scrubbing levels and fighting with the camera all the way; the way the camera snaps and strafes to face the main path forward makes all other paths death-traps to navigate (you can't move the camera and move at the same time; weird, I know). When the camera changes angles toward alternate paths, it does so suddenly, usually only when you over-extend yourself toward it or, for some reason, jump near it (this sometimes initiates a camera-angle switch, of course halting the momentum of the SONIC game).  If the camera works so actively against exploration for 2/3 of characters (Sonic, Shadow, Tails, and Eggman having linear levels), why gatekeep more content behind that engagement? Well, to make a game that takes less than 5 hours for an average player to rush through pumped up with optional tedium."

,Recommended,213610,21872713,"Posted: 16 March, 2016",all,Knock Out Dance Music (Official),"This was my very first and favorite sonic game. It still is to this day. The action is fast-paced, the music is outstanding, and the graphics were really ahead of their time. Those are the pros of the game but of course there are cons. One is that when you hit the trolley car in City Escape the car will float on top of your screen and sometime block your vision. Pretty annoying bug, but if you play the level long enough it shouldn't be too big of a deal. The other thing I disliked was the dialogue and voice acting. The dialogue was written lazily and English voice acting can really grate (especially Tails, Amy, and Rouge). The best ones out of all of them were Eggman and Shadow. However, you can change the voices to Japanese and they sound a lot better and match up with the characters' lips. Just don't change that setting on the launcher. That will change the subtitles and not the voices. Do it in the game and it will just do voices. Other than those two cons, this is the greatest sonic game ever. I hope Sega does more like this in the future instead of the Sonic franchise's grim reaper Sonic Boom."

,Recommended,213610,22017775,"Posted: 23 March, 2016",all,G4m3 grl,"I loved SA2 when I was younger, but nowadays I can only see it as ""okay"". It's by no means a bad game, but it's flawed in quite a few major ways.The game is split into two separate sides of the same story. The dark side story follows Dr. Eggman and two new characters to this game, Shadow the Hedgehog and Rouge the Bat. The hero side story follows Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles as they try to stop Eggman. To avoid spoilers, I won't go into detail about the plot, even though it's pretty poorly written and really not worth paying attention to.The two stories are split into the same three gameplay styles.Sonic and Shadow have your typical fast paced Sonic game 3D platforming. You run fast, homing-attack enemies, hit boosters, and try to get to the goal as fast as you can.Knuckles and Rouge have treasure hunting levels. These levels have you searching far and wide in the level to try to find three peices of the Master Emerald (or three keys in one level but that's beside the point). These levels can take forever becuase the radar system, which alerts you to when an emerald piece is nearby, only tracks one emerald at a time. At most, you'll be doing three full rounds of the level trying to find all of the pieces.Tails and Eggman have painfully slow mech shooting levels. In these levels, you pilot your mech on the way to the goal ring, trying to shoot as many enemies as possible at once because that's how you earn points. The only definitively good thing I can say about these levels is that they're great for grinding chaos drives for the chao garden.In general, Sonic Adventure 2 is a game that I have a lot of nostalgia for, but I can't say it's a great game. There are quite a few flaws, two of the gameplay styles feel out of place, especially considering that you have no say in what gameplay style you're going to play next going through the story. The sonic and shadow levels are fun, fast paced 3D platforming, and the chao are adorable and I refuse to ignore them."

,Recommended,213610,21019301,"Posted: 7 February, 2016",all,Kalmana,"Ah nostalgia. Oh how you make games from your childhood seem amazing. But, it's time to remove the rose colored glasses.When I saw this on sale, i really wanted to pick both of the adventure games up, since I haven't played the games in years. And boy, the problems.This game suffers from early 3D camera controls. Hard. While in stages that have wide areas the issue won't really be there, it's when you are in smaller cooridors where the problems will arise. Especially in Knuckles or Rouge's levels.There is also the voice acting. Early voice acting. While it can be kind of funny to listen to at times, it gets pretty old, pretty fast. And it shows that when the game was brought over, they didn't think about how fast the characters can talk in japanese, or at least get the point across faster. Which means that there will be times that characters will be talking at the same time, overlapping each other.For the characters themselves, For the most part, I don't have a issue with them, with a couple of minor complaints for Tails' and Eggmans stages. And this stems from the shooting mechanic. While the game has a decent soundtrack, it's hard to hear with the lock on noise constantly buzzing in your ears throughout their entire stages, since there is a lot of enemies and obsticals to lock onto and destroy in order to progress.My major complaint goes to Knuckles and Rogues' levels. They return to the crystal hunting levels from sonic adventure 1, but somehow made worse. Mostly due to the removal of two key elements that made the levels tolerable.1)Being able to detect multiple emeralds at a time.With how large some of the maps can be, it can take quite a while to find even one shard. In the original, it will always tell you the location of a shard, even if it wasn't the first in line. Which means that if you're unlucky, once you get the first shard you will have to traverse the entire map again looking for the location of the 2nd, and then do the same thing again with the third. Whcih could lead to scenarios where, you could go to one end of the map taking a minute or so, finding one shard, going to the beginning of the map, finding the second, the ngoing back to where you found the 1st shard, to find the third. Because  the game will not tell you that another shard was there, until it was time for it to be found.2)The shards change location upon death.In the first game, all of the shard locations are set when you enter a level, even when you die the locations will stay the same. However, this changes in the 2nd. In this game, upon death the locations of the shards change. Which could mean spending another few minutes looking for a shard that you might have been close to getting.While to people who just want to play the game normally, these are annoying, frusterating at best. But for those who want to A rank all of the stages, and each goal within the sages (time trial, hard mode, etc) it can ruin your run.Then comes the Chao. Which in all honesty is the biggest draw for me to the game as a child. To me, the chao raising is the most fleshed out part of the game. Being able to bring either animals or chaos drives back to your chao garden to give to your chao to make them better in certain stat(s) depending on what animal/drive you give them.There are also 3 different types of base chaos you can get, Neutral, Good, and Evil chao depending on what characters you raise them with. You can also get different chao features based upon what type of creatures/drives you give them, which will change the looks of the chao you get as it evolves and matures. Although if you take the time to bring them to their ""final form"" they will look the same, except for the color of the chao.And of course, breeding is a option you can do as well. Mixing and matching chao statistics to be able to get the perfect chao with all A rankings in their stats.Overall, this game is...decent. Definitely not as good as I remember it being. But still worth playing, even if it is just for the chao raising.6/10"

Sonic Adenture 2 is a classic, and will always be one of my favorites. And the PC port allows users to mod the game, so you can use any character in any stage.

The game runs great on my computer, minus a few slowdown issues in some of the levels, but my computer isn't really that powerful anyway.

One of the most famous Sonic games of all time.Love it or hate it, SA2 did a lot for the series and people still clamor for SA3 today. SA2 has that old-day gaming feel to it, and though the graphics aren't amazing, the game itself is great.First things first: you should play this on a console. The keyboard controls are just disgusting. They lessened my opinion of the PC port, but otherwise, the PC port is solid.Anyways, the story still is timeless. Join your favorite Sonic characters as they race against eachother, Sonic's team trying to stop Eggman and his goons as always and Shadow's team working with Eggman to take over the world. Eventually, you'll unlock a third route, which has a truly powerful ending.The gameplay varies, and you'll have the most fun with Sonic and Shadow's levels, most likely. Knuckles' and Rogue's are a bit of a chore, but Tails and Eggman's levels are a good amount of fun, what with their combo shooting. But as I said, Sonic and Shadow's levels are where the real fun begins, and they'll remind you that a good Sonic game hasn't been seen since Generations.And what you've been waiting for the most...the Chao Garden. It's still great, and adorable and fun as ever. Raise your Chao and make them battle eachother as well as race eachother. The Chao Garden is one of SA2's key features and one that gamers everywhere miss quite a bit. I still want my Tails Chao!Overall, SA2 is an 8.5/10. One of, if not the, best Sonic games, yet the PC port suffers from awful controls and the lip-syncing is just laughable. However, look past those two factors and you have a fun, memorable, great game on your hands.Also, Big the Cat is in it so I have to reccommend it anyways."

I’ve heard xbox controllers work, but I certainly didn't have one. Compared to the gamecube version, the controls here were incredibly sensitive and rather finicky. I think I encountered a few glitches as well. For example, after coming out of invincibility, I just died randomly, even after killing all the enemies around me. It was like inhaling a nuclear fart after your gas mask fails and the source leaves the room.If you can solve the controller issue, you might have a better experience than I had. I've played and beaten the gamecube version of this game a couple times, but this port was an absolute rage inducer. I mean, I understand porting a game from consoles to PC can be hard, but come on. I died way more than I should have. You really let me down here Sonic. You really let me down.Other than those points, the game isn't too bad. It's a classic sonic game that you should experience at least once in your life, but the porting here kinda sucked. Sonic Adventure DX was ported better.10/10.

But to be fair, my thoughts are mostly positive.The Sonic/Shadow parts can be pretty fun when you get used to controlling their speed. Successful homing attacks and light dashes always make you feel like a badass. The camera can be a bit bothersome, though.The Knuckles/Rouge parts are as terrible as everyone says they are. I don't mind they way they both control, I just wish the levels were made around those controls instead of frustating treasure hunts that last up to 20 minutes! And again, terrible camera.Surprisingly enough, despite everyone's criticisms, I really like the Tails/Eggman parts. I'm not gonna act like they were the most revolutionary levels I ever played, but I thought locking on to targets and shooting stuff was really fun. I even liked the platforming for some reason! The camera can get kind of bad, but not AS bad since these levels are slower.In the end, it was an interesting experience. Unlike many, I never owned a GameCube so I never grew up with this game.

Sonic and Shadow have the speed stages, Tails and Eggman have the platform stages, and Knuckles and Rouge have the treasure hunt stages.Sonic Adventure 2 vastly improves on the Chao Garden, which many players consider to be the best aspect of this game. It's fun, it's unique, and it was great for its time watching the Chao's appearance change depending on the allignment of the character raising it.Overall, it's a fun experience and it's definitely worth the purchase (especially at the current sale price of £2.99).It's a solid 8/10 for me."

It has an amazing ost, great gameplay, pretty nice graphics, and it introduced my second favorite Sonic character of all time, pre-where's that damn fourth chaos emerald Shadow. Some classic sonic enthusiasts may bring up that the varying gameplay ruins it for them because if you're not blandly running forward and sometimes jumping then it is not good, but the treasure hunting stages slow down the gameplay to let casual players fly around and explore levels instead of racing to the finish as fast as possible, and the mech stages are fun because you get to shoot things, I like shooting things.The varying gameplay is not a curse but rather a blessing, all you really have to do to win a Sonic game is hold forward and sometimes you may jump, but with the treasure hunting and mech stages you have to take it slow and they're almost kind of relaxing.I feel like most hate for 3D Sonic games comes from not only nostalgia but the fact that they try new stuff in them, new gameplay styles, new mechanics, etc and then they change how the game works even a little bit sonic extremists lose their minds and throw a♥♥♥♥♥♥fit. Sonic Adventure 2 has problems, but I'd happily say it holds up with the ""bestest Sonic game ever made in the world"" Fast The Speedman 3 and Knobles.

Maybe the graphics are outdated but gameplay is awsome.Pros.1 - You blow the freaking moon in a Sonic game.2- 3 types of gameplays( speed, treasure hunting,  mechs)SPEED: You can play as Sonic or Shadow and the levels are fast paced. Objective: Gotta go fast from point A to BTREASURE HUNTIG: You can play as Knuckels or Rouge. Objective: Finding 3 emerald pieces by exploring the level and  by searching hints(they are everywhere so it's easy to have a hint)MECHS: you can play as Tails or Dr.Eggman. They use mechs and their gameplay is basically a shoot-em-up. A bit slow, but ok.3-  One of the best plots in the sonic franchise. It's not cringe, it has a good character development, and overall a great structure.4- Personally i like the keyboard control but some people don't, so I recommend picking a controller,5 - More than 120 hours if you want all the achievementsCons1 - Emerald's Radar is totally crippled compared to its predecessor. Even if you're standing in fron of the emerald, the Radar will not tell you if you're close or not. It just detects one emerald at a time while in the first Sonic Adventure it could detect all Emeralds2 - Maybe you're too slow for the game(jkjkjk)I rate this game 9.5 / 10"

Gameplay is good, though the story not so much. I can see if most didn't enjoy some of the stages, namely the infamous treasure hunting stages and shooting stages. The walker's your character is in can be very clunky to control and the treasure hunting stages have gotten worse since the previous Sonic Adventure game. The rader to help locate the emerald pieces has been heavily nerfed and it can be annoying due to such reasons. However, above all this, the game is still immensly fun. I have completed this game 100% and it was definently worth it. I want to recommend this game to more people, but I don't think everyone will enjoy this game.

The Story is meh, but who wants a good story on a Sonic game. The cutscenes arent as painful to watch as in  SADX, but the characters constantly interrupt each other because the cutscenes were programed for the japanese dub of the game, even though the game was made in Sega of America.

Amazing gameplay and the controls are easily the most smoothest I have ever used.  There is plenty of content to do even though this game changed from a more open world the first one was to a stage by stage story with cutscenes.

76561198203395704,Recommended,213610,31865295,Posted: 20 May,all,Mz3player,"Having played quite a few other Sonic games and hearing that they were inferior to Sonic Adventure 2, I was excited to finally buy the game on sale. I've beaten the Last Story now, and while the game is a solid and fun experience, I couldn't help but wonder why classic Sonic fans put this one on a pedestal. Nostalgia is strong for them, I suppose - as a first-time player I couldn't help but be slightly underwhelmed, though I did enjoy the game.Gameplay revolves around three different playstyles - the speed-based platforming of Sonic and Shadow, the mech-shooting of Tails and Eggman, and the treasure-hunting of Knuckles and Rouge. Personally, I felt like the Sonic/Shadow stages were the best-executed and are the ones that are legitimately fun to play; they involve high-speed movement combined with being on the lookout for alternate paths and bonuses. If you've only played the 3D Sonic games after Heroes, the constant changing speeds might be a little bit alienating, but it works quite well for the game.The mech stages involve moving through a level and shooting just about everything you can. Your mech can lock on to enemies, item bubbles, and stage components, allowing you to blast them, rack up points, and clear a path through the level. These stages are probably the worst of the lot, mostly because your mech controls really weirdly and someone thought that putting in platforming that would be easy to mess upwithoutthe aforementioned control issues and the broken camera (more on that below) was a good idea.The treasure-hunting stages are definitely not bad, but they have the most potential for tedium and frustration. Your character is tasked with finding three plot coupons in wide-open levels, and they're given a radar to help them find said coupons. These stages suffer from random placement of these targets, however; one time through the level they could be incredibly simple to find, while another time they might require deep exploration of each part of the level. Compounding this problem is the inability to view more than one of your targets on the radar, leading to not one, but three wild goose chases across the level if you're unlucky with the order of the targets. Parts of a level do little to distinguish themselves from one another, making exploration feel like a chore sometimes.There's also a slight Metroidvania element in the game: an upgrade in each regular stage gives the character obtaining it a new permanent ability. These feel somewhat flawed as well: the ones needed to progress in the game are pretty much handed to you, while the ones required only for the additional missions are in tough-to-reach areas, which would be fine if the game didn't require you to get a good time to acquire an A rank.Aside from the fun, though flawed, main stages, there are side games like kart racing and the incredibly-popular Chao Garden. Both of these activities are required for full completion, and they're both less than perfect: kart racing has little depth and difficult controls, while Chao-raising doesn't progress quickly enough (in my opinion; I can see the appeal of Chao raising, but I'm not a huge fan of it). For all of its rough edges, the game does have plenty of content, especially for completionists. There's also a 2-player mode (disclaimer: I bought the Battle DLC along with the main game) that is fun to mess around with, though it's certainly not the most deep or polished experience.The game's aesthetics are dripping with cheesy early 2000's charm; whether that's a good thing or a bad thing is up to you. The graphics are bright and colorful, although they're definitely dated. The voice acting is pretty terrible, with Knuckles and Eggman being the only major characters with decently-voiced lines more than half the time. The soundtrack is excellent, as is usual for Sonic games, with different styles accompanying each character; if you don't like cheesy lyrics, you might be displeased with Sonic and Knuckles' stages, but I think they work really well in the game. The camera deserves a dishonorable mention here: it hinders every character's stages and has led to more than a few of my deaths playing through the game. It's especially egregious in Sonic's penultimate level, where gravity gets flipped while the camera doesn't, and the controls start acting weird to go along with it.At the time of writing I had 24 hours put into the game and over half the emblems; despite the game's flaws, it's a lot of fun, and I definitely intend to go for all 180. Whether you'll enjoy the game will likely depend on whether you can look past the imperfections to see where the game shines.

This game improved on many things the first game did wrong but it sadly also failed in other things the first game did right (e.g. No hub worlds except for Chao Garden).The game has various character stages but you'll actually see yourself playing Sonic and Shadow stages later because all the other stages have ideas that could've worked but they don't exactly feel very fun.The main storyline is a big mess with a lot of plotholes and things left unexplained but I still liked it a lot.My favorite thing inside the game is the Chao Garden. Treating those Chaos is the best experience inside the game and can also take a long time depending on what type of Chao you want to make.The game also features other modes like coop, kart racing and even a mode to speedrun the game. I feel like they made this very well too.A very good Sonic game that you should not miss."

I of course played back when this was on the Dreamcast. Then I played when it hit the Gamecube. Again once it hit Xbox 360 Arcade. I've always loved Sonic Adventure 1 and 2, and it's no stranger that most people don't unless they are pretty big fans of the Sonic universe in general. I LOVE the Chao gardens. That's always what kept me playing these after I had beaten them. The story is a typical Sonic style story. As are the characters. This IS 3D Sonic. I love the soundtrack for this game as I did the first one. I'm sad it's not a free roam like the first one but you look through that once you play. I still believe this game is fantastic and worth the play if you just enjoy Sonic games.I currently play on a GTX 1070 FTW, 1900x1080 and have no issues. I use a controller and I will admit the game is tedious if you don't use one but well worth. Especially it being on sale right now. This is a very underdog gem of a game.Too many people diss on it when it's actually a pretty solid game. Is it better than the first? I don't personally think so but it's not too far from it either. I can't praise the Chao Garden enough.Honestly, for the price that it is currently, it's worth getting. Just do it. Play it. Enjoy the level designs. There's more to this game than what negative reviews will show. Especially for the nostalgia."

76561198039939102,Recommended,213610,32824766,Posted: 26 June,all,gav THE killa,"Sonic Adventure 2: BATTLE! is my most nostalgic gamecube game and one of the best games I have ever played. I think I got it for Christmas in the mid-2000s and I always remember it so fondly. My cousin Ezra (who plays on Steam) gave me his memory card data for this and Super Smash Bros. Melee so that I didn't have to suffer through the main story as a young kid. Thanks for that dude.Anyway, here's my thoughts on the game:The graphics and music are classic. SA2:B! oozes with charm and angsty 2000s vibes.The gameplay is fluid, hilarious and sometimes BS. Have fun failing most of these harder missions, A LOT.The single player missions are frustrating, challenging, but fun.The voice acting and cutscenes are cute and funny. Most Sonic games (excluding Shadow The Hedgehog) are like this.The Chao Garden is so fun, it could be a standalone game and I'd throw $60 at it. Fascinating to see such a complex system on a game so early. You can raise good or bad chaos, legendary chaos, reincarnate chaos based on if they like you enough, feed them animals hidden in levels to give them amazing stats, have them compete against other chaos, and much more.SA2:B! brings me back to a time when life was way better, I was closer to family, I had less worries, and I had no responsibilities. It was also the mid-2000s and that is one of the best eras IMO.When I play this game it's definitely bittersweet because the camera flaws and mission frustrations start to push me off playing. But I'll try to push through. The ending boss fight is really fun, and so is the knuckles circular level.Anyway, get this game if you want to see one of the best Gamecube/Dreamcast games come back to life. Because I had it on Dolphin and the actual Gamecube still, I didn't buy it until it went on the 2017 Steam Summer Sale. So I have it on 3 platforms now."

The music, characters, maps, and the Chao world feature are iconic in this game. No, it hasn't aged too well. If you return, or introduce yourself, to this game as an adult you might find yourself a bit disappointed. Even so, I find this to be my favorite sonic game no matter how bad the voice acting, dialouge, and controls might be. The price is reasonable, and the return to old and beloved sonic games is absolutley worth it.There are a few issues with the game on a pc platform, sadly. I, like a select few, had a lot of trouble trying to get this game running for the first time. This problem is easily solvable, and has been discussed in other community forums.I feel like this would be a pretty fun present to someone who grew up with the game, as those who grew up with it tend to adore the game."

Granted, it would have been nice if Sega had decided to fix the audio balancing and maybe update the graphics a bit...Look. This game is not as good as a lot of us thought it was back in the early 00's. But if you're just looking for a nostalgia trip, this is a solid, well-made port. It looks fine, handles decently, and has good controller functionality. And of course it has the single greatest soundtrack of any Sonic game (I will ♥♥♥♥ing fight you on this).

The game is the best one and Super fun to come back to, especially the small mods to make the action more intense. My first time playing this game was when I was 6 years old. My cousin had the Gamecube port of this game but of course had SA1 to come along with it. We played for hours upon hours playing mostly SA2 and even played the 2 player mode for a while. About 4 years later, I didn't go to my cousins house during that time but got a hard copy for the Gamecube but for my Wii and never beat it because I didn't have an SD card, so none of my game profile saved. In 2013, I discovered Steam and played Octodad before anything. Then I looked up Sonic one day and found this game. I was so hyped so I did some chores to earn money and waisted 10$ to buy this game and never stopped even to this day!Thank you SEGA for making my childhood and my cousin for letting me play this game and got me into the franchise.Sonic Adventure DX and Sonic Adventure 2 are my favorite Sonic titles other than Unleashed and will forever be in my heart."

Companies such as Nintendo, Valve, Bethesda, Naughty Dog, and countless others could only HOPE to one day create an experience similar to what the folks on Sonic Team and SEGA were able to accomplish.Overall, I give this game a 2/5....

One thing before i go into this review if you have a controller i advise it, if you dont then your f##k unless you like using keys for everything.Sonic Adventure 2 is a pretty cool game, it's better than most if not all the newer sonic games that have came out. I'm a OG Sonic fan, i remember when i was a little lad i would play sonic on the sega genesis my parents owned (they are also OG Sonic fans but not as much as me) so playing this was a treat.So you got two game modes (that i know of so far) Story & Battle. In story you either play as heros (Sonic, Tails, Knuckles, ect) or Villans (Shadow, Rough, Dr. Robotnic, ect) and playing as them is pretty fun. Sonic and Shadow are the same in there stages, they run as fast as they can go as in a normal sonic game, Tails and Robotnic are in mechs fighting robot, and Knuckles and Rough are stages were you go flying around and punching. Battle mode is a multiplayer mode were you go up against AI or other players (Online is not sure in this game)I only had two complaints about the game. 1, the voice acting is really cringy like back tingling. Everone in this game sounds so stupid and cheesy besides probably Sonic and Robotnic. 2, like i said earlier, if you don't have a xbox 360 or a steam controller than it's gonna be pretty difficult because everything and i mean EVERYTHING is used by keys.Besides these tiny complaints i find the game very enjoyable and fun to play, your gonna laugh your a$$ off if you laugh about cheesy voice acting and wierd plots.

I mean it's not perfect, there are glitches, but they don't really disturb you in any way.I think the main reason this game is pure joy is the Chao Garden, where you get to raise Chaos, train them and let them compete against other Chaos. It get's even better with mods, which expand the already huge logic there is behind raising your personal Chaos.Let's go on with the Music, this is a solid 10/10. Hearing the City Escape Theme sends you right into nostalgia-heaven. The Knuckles-Raps are lit af and sweetended with inappropiate lyrics.But what makes the game what really is, is the gameplay. You get to play with the Hero-side and the Evil-side. It's not the regular run through this level then run through that level. Knuckles and Rouge are all about finding Emerald-pieces, Sonic and Shadow let you play with a little bit more speed, while Tails and Eggman sit in their maschines and shoot around with built-in bazookas and stuff.All in all Sonic Adventure 2 is a really good game, and a must-have for every Sonic fan out there.

If you love Sonic you will love this game.If you love this game, then Chao World Extended is a MUST.SA2 was the apex of 3D sonic.  While the modern games are...okay I guess, This is one of the three 3D Sonic games that I have kepts playing well past completion, and will continue to play well into the future.Once again, if you own this game, I highly recommend you look into the Chao World Extended mod.  With a seemingly infinate amount of extra things to do with your Chao, and the ability to use Multiplayer Exclusive characters in Single Player settings it more than trippled the replay value of the game!"

After finding a controller to play with (because let's face it, you need to have a controller) I was excited to go and play the game and actually attempt to beat it, so I set my resolution to something that wouldn't crash the game and finally started playing it until I beat the game.

Do not expect a great game.The worse thing it is the gameplay, because you cannot learn about your faults, this happens when you play a game where the bugs appears suddenly. That means, even if you have a good gameplay, you can die in every moment, mixing a bad control, bad camera, bad gameplay and a lot of bugs (less than the prequel).Better than the first part in every section.By the way, there is no Steam Cloud again...

The high speed Sonic and Shadow levels are purely awesome, and the Shooter and Treasure Hunter levels are still a ton of fun. Then, there's the Chao Garden, where you can raise your own chao the way you wish to raise it, which can be very addictive.Now, this game does have its problems, but the only true major glitch I've seen is a graphical glitch in City Escape, which I've memorized from my time in the game, so it doesn't bother me much. There are other, minor glitches, but they don't seem to affect the fun of the game.The battle DLC is also fun, adding the multiplayer features from the GameCube version, and, if you have an extra controller, along with a friend who is willing to play, it can be a lot of fun.Not only all of this, SA2 has a great soundtrack, with my favorites being ""Live and Learn"" and ""Escape from the City.""

Because of this combined with the cheap price, I decided to purchase Sonic Adventure 2 and the Battle DLC. After a rough start where my antivirus treated the game as malware, I was finally able to play it after years of wanting to. In my opinion, the game hasn't aged too well, but I still love it due to the nostalgia. The game is still quite solid because of my childhood nostalgia involving the game. I would definitely recommend the game to those who want to explore through Sonic's Dreamcast days or who want to simply relive childhood memories like me. Don't boot up the game expecting a masterpiece, as the game is old, but it's still incredibly enjoyable past the sometimes glitchy platforms, bad audio mixing, and plot holes."

The Gamecube port was the one I considered to be the better experience and was the version I played the most. As the years went on, and as more Sonic games were released, I found the reception to this game to be more and more mixed. Some people still claim this as one of the best Sonic titles out there, while others consider it one of the worst. While I certainly don't consider this game to be better than the classics or even the more modern games like Sonic Generations, I do still find things to enjoy quite a bit in it. The real meat of this game are the Sonic and Shadow stages which focus on traditional speed and platforming. Those stages are usually the reason I keep returning. I may dabble a bit in some Pumkin Hill here and there, but I usually stay clear of the treasure hunting and shooting stages.When talking about the PC port overall, I find it to be very acceptable for what it is: a solid port. This is not an HD remake, it's the exact same exprience as the Gamecube version just with widescreen, 1080p support, and a different controller. So if you didn't enjoy the game in the first place, this version probobly won't win you over. However, if you don't mind that it's a basic port, then I absolutely reccomend you pick this up. For only $10, it's a steal (especcially if you pick it up on a Steam sale like I did.) It's better than going out and looking for a used copy of it."

Now moving on to this release, I am completely baffled why it was promoted in some areas as a ""HD"" release, as besides from being able to switch to HD resolutions, the game's graphics are practically the same res as they were on the original release. Besides this minor complaint, the game runs excellently, although it has aged a bit in a few ways, particularly the graphics (it was released in 2002, though!) and some of the dialogue is cringeworthy at times.Although the game is generally enjoyable, it sadly suffers from a number of flaws, the most apparent being the utterly dire camera design which can lead to you missing platforms and falling to your death. And the level designs, whilst quite good in some places, begin to turn grind-heavy towards the end of the game, and whilst this does make it more challenging, the rail jumping mechanism is very unreliable making jumping from rail to rail quite difficult.Musically, the game sounds amazing - unlike most games of its time Sonic Adventure 2's soundtrack is almost fully orchestrated, with real instrumentation rather than MIDI ones. If I had one complaint, it would be that the rapping in Knuckles' level music is a bit cheesy, but it manages to make up for it by being relatively subdued and not completely in your face.As a whole, f you're looking for an introduction into 3D sonic games, I'd highly recommend SA2 along with SA1, as they're both great games if you can overlook their numerous flaws. However, if you're willing to acquire SA1 I recommend looking into installing BetterSADX for the Steam version as it fixes so many issues that are present in the Steam release."

Without the Battle DLC, this game is rather broing and doesn't last a long time. However, this time around, Sonic Team is packing heat and with the help of some new ideas and the return of some old concepts, Adventure blows Adventure 1 out of the water. For one, the soundtrack wrecks everything. The characters (at least the new ones) are pretty okay additions, Shadow obviously being a huge favorite among the entire fandom. He's not as one dimensional as some of the new characters from Adventure 1, such as Gamma, who would never see a subsequent game, but had a gripping story, and Big...well, let's just that FROGGY isn't that interesting. Rouge is also new to the world, being Knuckles' rival and ""love interest?""? I don't know exactly what Sonic Team was aiming for here, but I'm not a fan of her personally. The one thing that caught my eye with this one was the enhanced Chao Garden. In Batlle, Chao Karate is present with the already existing Chao Racing, and it's so much fun. In this version, there is only Racing, but everything is much simpler and the shop allows to hold 5 items at once instead of 1. All in all, this game rubs me the right way in a lot of places."

There are some close calls from other games in the series but, for me and my lot, I throw this one as the best 3d sonic game to play."

The GameCube version in other ways (better multi-player, improved Chao system).The PC version is really the GameCube version operating in a Dreamcast-like mode with some GameCube version assets here and there until you buy the Battle DLC.  The downside here is unlike the original Dreamcast version, you can't get all 180 emblems without buying the Battle DLC.  Once you buy the Battle DLC, it starts working in GameCube mode (you can turn this on and off though).Also unlike the original console versions of this game there are some issues with sound effects being far too loud.  One nice touch is that the PC version does run Full HD and 4K resolutions with a true 16:9 ratio with an exception of a few cutscenes.  The original Dreamcast and GameCube versions ran at a max 480P (EDTV) resolution with 4:3 ratio for comparison but most probably played it at 480i (SDTV) resolution with yellow, white, and red cables back in the day when bulky tubes were the only kind of TVs that existed in a vast majority of people's homes.  Also beware if you have a Surround Sound system that the audio is broken here, too.  It should be noted that the Xbox 360 and Playstation 3 versions are the same as the PC version except unmoddable.I recommend it only under the circumstance you never played the Dreamcast or GameCube versions (the later one more specifically) and generally into these kind of aged games, looking to finish your digital Sonic collection or looking for a version you can mod a bit."

Also you get to raise cute alien babies and make them compete in dog races and in Karate fights. To achieve the best alien you can have, you will have to manipulate the baby feelings which will later create factions and races and then you can invest in artificial breeding in order to create the ultimate lifeform, a chao with S on all stats! Good game!"
