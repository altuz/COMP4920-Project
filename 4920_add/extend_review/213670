76561197973299300,Recommended,213670,12838648,"Posted: 7 November, 2014",all,davidr64,"Fantastic game.  The whole way through, the experience feels like watching a really good South Park episode or South Park movie, and the game is a *really* solid RPG, to boot.But the game isn't without its flaws.  I want to spend a few paragraphs on some criticisms of the game, and then we'll talk about what makes the game awesome.The game feels heavily ""consolized.""  Loading screens are far more frequent than they should be and the controls often don't make much sense.  Throughout the game your character will be taught ""magic spells"" from various NPCs.  Each time you learn a spell, you are taught a series of controls to use that spell.  However, these spells can be used both in and out of combat, and in both situations the controls are different from one another—and in neither situation is the spell invoked the same way the game inititally taught you!Your out-of-combat utilities (like firing a ranged weapon at something in the environment or sending a buddy to perform a task) are equally awkward to select and use.Now, here I should note that I played with a controller attached to a PC.  I started the game with a keyboard/mouse but changed very, very early on to give my normal gaming posture a rest (I play games a lot with the keyboard/mouse), and also because South Park: The Stick of Truth seemed to be tailored more toward a controller.  Perhaps the controls are better with a keyboard/mouse, but using a controller felt awkward in many parts of the game.  But not in combat.  In combat the controls felt great.  More on that later, though.On top of that, the game's humor can be off-putting in some parts.  This isn't a real criticism so much as it is a warning—it IS South Park, after all!  The show has a reputation of making comedy material out of even the most sensitive of topics, and this game also doesn't hold back.  I like to think of myself as a fairly easy-going guy and I try not to take many things too seriously, but there were parts in this game that I felt myself somewhat rushing through or avoiding just to get away from an uncomfortable topic.There's a lot of back-and-forth running around the map in this game, and loading screens are absolutely everywhere.  The loading screens are a real slowdown.So let's see.  The loading screens, the really iffy controls in much of the game, and the warning about how the game remains very South Park in its humor are all the things I wanted to make sure to mention.  So, now we can talk about the stuff that makes this game a fantastic one!While moving on the map and navigating menus is often awkward with the game's controls, combat is something the game gets very, very right.  As I mentioned earlier, this game is a very solid RPG, and The Stick of Truth's turn-based combat is airtight.  This isn't your typical ""select an ability and watch what happens"" kind of turn-based combat.  Here, you'll select an ability, and then you'll influence the outcome of the ability with some simple, but fun controls.For example, Butters the Paladin has a ""Hammer of Justice"" ability.  To use it, you select it and then choose a target.  The game then has you rotate the left control stick in circles to make Butters spin (think Olympic discus tossing), and at just the right instant, press the A button.  Succeed, and you'll deal bonus damage to the enemy!  If you mess up, Butters will still deal damage, but not as much.  Again, this is coming from the perspective of using a gamepad to control the game; I'm sure this is different for a mouse/keyboard, but the principle is the same.Combat is filled with awesome stuff like this.  When you are attacked, most of the time you are given the chance to block some of the enemy's damage by pressing A at just the right time.  Some enemy attacks strike multiple times, requiring multiple well-timed blocks!  Different enemy attacks have different timings as well, so you'll always need to be on your guard.These combat mechanics make even turn-based combat a very active affair.  The action is fast and challenging, so you'll need to be spot on with your controls.  Thankfully, controls in combat are responsive and intuitive, and anytime there's some ambiguity about what to do in battle, there are useful tooltips and pop-ups to remind you of how to use an ability.While combat is great fun, the game also very often presents you with multiple ways of dealing with foes.  Sometimes you can distract them and sneak by.  Other times you can use the environment to defeat your foes without having to confront them.  Keen awareness of your surroundings and appropriate use of your abilities out of combat can speed up your progress and yield satisfying results.It should be noted that if you sneak by enemies, you probably won't get experience for dealing with them.  But in the cases where you can use the environment to defeat them, you'll be awarded experience as if you had battled them!There are many quests to accomplish throughout the game, and a few side quests can be completed as you progress.  As far as questing is concerned, it's your typical RPG fare—pick up a quest, complete the objectives, turn the quest in.  The game does nothing to revolutionize questing, but it handles questing very well.The story-based quests, however, are always greatly satisfying to accomplish because you are awarded not only with experience and often loot/money, but also with story exposition done in only the way South Park can.  It really does feel like you're earning a little piece of a South Park episode or South Park movie when you complete a story quest.The writing in the game is spot on.  You'll get to watch the South Park characters you're so familiar with do the things they do, in the way they do them, while interacting with one another and with your character.  I found the story largely fun and interesting.I was often quite pleased with the developers' efforts to include as many South Park characters as they could in the game.  This could not have been an easy task to accomplish, but the game is solid through-and-through with the show's characters, and because the show has been running so long, these characters bring with them their histories, backdrops, and references that the South Park fan should thoroughly enjoy.Character customization is very in-depth for a game with such a simplistic visual style.  You'll begin the game by choosing a class, and then customizing your looks.  As the game progresses, you will find, like, a bajillion different ways to customize your charcter's costume (""gear""), hair, facial features, makeup, and accessories.  You'll even find ""strap-ons"" (for weapons) and ""patches"" (for armor) that let you add significant bonuses to your gear, letting you really specialize or round out your character and playstyle.I did make a warning above about the game's humor, but for South Park fans, that (most of the time) means you're in for more of what you enjoy about the show.  There were plenty of times I found myself actually laughing out loud at the characters' antics; or at the writing; or at the timing of a joke; or just at South Park being South Park.  It's a funny game.There is also a difficulty slider bar.  Early in the game I cranked the difficulty to max and didn't look back, and for me, it was quite rewarding.  The window of opportunity to block enemy attacks seemed drastically smaller, necessitating more precise timing, and enemies often didn't go down without a fight.  I had to stay on top of my gear choices and customize appropriately.  Which buddy to bring into battle with me was also a serious consideration, and more than once I had to stock up on potions.Overall, it's just a really solid RPG, and I'd strongly recommend it to any South Park fan.  I could go on about it, but I feel I've covered most of the relevant aspects of the game, and apparently Steam has a character limit for reviews.  :)"

See ConclusionNOTE:I have played this game extensively when my internet was down (which was 3 days long) so Steam did not record my game time. Steam does not record game time while offline and if I remember correctly I should have 10-11 hours clocked in.INTRODUCTION:South Park: The Stick of Truth is a 2014 role-playing game based on the popular TV show South Park. The game was developed by Obsidian Entertainment, and surprisingly enough, published by Ubisoft in one of those occasions where they release a game that is not broken or tied to Uplay. Good job Ubisoft!PLOT (No Spoilers):The story takes place in the town of South Park where you, the player, take on the role of the 'new kid' who holds a mysterious power of making friends really fast. Upon arriving, you quickly learn about an ongoing 'Battle' (game) between the Human forces of Cartman and the Drow Elves loyal to Kyle for the control of an artifact of limitless power called 'The Stick of Truth'.PROS:+ Great art style that mimics the TV Series with great accuracy making the game feel more like an episode of the TV show rather than a video game.+ High resolution art works and good animations+ Great sound design that remains true to the TV series' quality+ Wonderful voice acting featuring the original cast andAdolf Hitler+ Good old fashion South Park humor (See NEUTRAL #2)+ Very fun and well integrated gameplay mechanics+ Good amount of Easter eggs from the TV Show+ Excellent overall presentation starting from the character creation screen until the end credits+ Excellent Story+ Fun Canada mini-game+ Good amount of character customization however...(See CON #2)+ No Uplay account neededCONS:- Gameplay becomes repetitive after a while- Very limited armor & weapon customization and selection- No crafting mechanic to fix the above CON- Useless DLC itemsNEUTRAL:+/- Excusable 30 fps lock because it works well with the graphics, gameplay and artstyle+/- The South Park toilet and black/dark humor may not appeal to everyone (so if you don't like South Park to begin with, you will probably not like this game as well.)+/- The story is fairly linear but the presentation makes it feel as if it was open worldCONCLUSION:EXCELLENTgame for South Park fans all around. This game preserves the look and feel of the series while integrating very fun and entertaining gameplay mechanics that would rival even some of the much more established RPG games.WORTH IT?:I canRECOMMENDthis game at itsfull priceonly if you're a South Park fan because chances are, any fan of the series would fully appreciate all the extra content and easter eggs from the show.  However, if you're not a fan of the series but don't particularly hate it, get the game during asale. If you hate the series and/or you're easily offended / triggered by dark / toilet humor I would not recommend purchasing this game.---------------------------------------------------------Like my Reviews?

,Recommended,213670,17377919,"Posted: 3 August, 2015",all,Chroto,"I have never watched the TV show before so my review may be coming from a more unique perspective.This game is just a blast to play. The combat is simple and easy to master. The writing and dialogue is where the game really shines. There are so many times where I was cracking up by the absurdity of what was happening (Looking at you Al Gore). I know a lot of the jokes are from the TV show so any fan of the series will feel right at home. If you are new to the series like me, don't let that discourage you. I still enjoyed every second of this game regardless.That being said, the game is very raunchy so that may turn some people off. I didn't mind it as I found most of it funny, but there were times I had to turn the game volume down because it was getting so bad haha. This is more of a warning than a negative for those of you who are more easily offended. If you are then stay far, far, away (like maybe somewhere in Canada)!If you are on the fence then pick the game. You won't regret it :)"
,Recommended,213670,19390806,"Posted: 30 November, 2015",all,SpaceCouncil,"Teal DeerDevelopers:Obsidian Entertainment, South Park Digital StudiosPublishers:UbisoftInitial release:March 2014Genre:Active turn based RPG#Worth/NotWorth:#WorthExposition, Concurrence and SummationShort version: Adult Costume QuestLong version: South Park the Stick of Truth is a turn based RPG with surprising depth. Likely due to our friends over at Obsidian known for their RPG game prowess.Now, this game is not for people who are easily offended . I hope anyone taking the time to read this already knows what South Park is as I'm fairly certain South Park is a known commodity. Using cuss words is the base value. One of the enemies you fight during a main quest of the game is anaborted nazi zombie fetusYes, they ago all the places. I don't think there is anywhere else to go.SETUPYou are the new kid in South Park and all your favorite characters are here. (voiced by the real actors of the show) As the new kid you are told by your parents to get out of your room by your parents and make some friends. You leave your home and are met by Butters and he introduces you to Cartman and the kingdom of humans. Calling themselves the Kingdom of Kupa Keep. Unfortunately this name has the acronym of KKK. Which is clearly the joke but I thought I'd mention it anyways.After meeting Cartman, you get to choose 1 of 4 classes to play as; Mage, Warrior, Thief, or Jew. I played as a thief and as far as I can tell the only thing this effects is the equipment awarded at specific stages in the game and of course your special abilities. Upon choosing your class and getting a basic tutorial of how combat works you are told about the Stick of Truth and the LARP'ing begins. Though as you may have suspected, its not all fun and games. Things take a pretty serious turn even given South Parks satirical nature.GAMEPLAYThis borrows from the likes of Paper Mario and the newer Costume Quest. Turn-based combat while timing button presses to, on defense mitigate the amount of damage taken and on offense, increase the damage or in some cases hit at all. Your character has abilities based on your class which have specific interactions in order to be the most effective. There are also summons which you can earn from completing side quests.Each weapon is different, the effects as well as the way it attacks. Same goes for equipment. A nice touch is that there is no restrictions for class on clothing or weapons but it kind of breaks the role-playing bit, at least in my opinion.In The Stick of Truth you can customize your appearance; however it seems to not be entirely important as you can change your appearance with wigs, makeup and a number of other items that are available in the game. You cannot play as a female as there is a narrative reason why this is not an option.The game is surprisingly open world, not in the sense of being able to truly influence the world in the way you see fit (the narrative is very concise and pulls you toward the end regardless) but it allows you do side quests and actually rewards you for exploring. I remember multiple times having gone into someones house or down a sewer pipe on a whim and being given multiple new quests to complete as well as finding many new items I would have never found otherwise.THE GISTGreat fun little RPG especially if you already like South Park. To be honest I don't watch the show regularly but I was familiar enough to know all the main characters and even some of the obscure ones. But I'd guess even knowing nothing going in its still very easy to follow. I'm sure I missed some of the deep cuts of fan-service but the jokes stand on their own regardless.Follow my curation for more"
76561198259988338,Recommended,213670,32662140,Posted: 22 June,all,xXn00bslayerXx,"Fun game, especially if you're a fan of South Park and it's style of humor. This game essentially gives the player - the ""new kid"" - control of being in an episode. It's longer than I anticipated and the game play is surprisingly better than I thought it would be. I guessed this game would be shallow, easy and basically a gimmick instead of a game, but I was wrong. The developers created a full-fledged game with lots of love and creativity. I beat the game along with majority of the side quests in about 21 hours. For 100%, the average completion falls somewhere around 25-30 hours.Pros:+ Game play/fight scenes are fun (some challenging, some easy)+ Story - Main story is linear, but the side quests are not. All are decent to good.+ Skill progression (not very complex, but not too basic either)+ Can explore the entire South Park town.+ Humor – humor and characters are straight from the series. Literally lol'd at times.+ Graphics - exactly like the series which I thought was a plus.+ Loots/Inventory+ Weapons/Armor/Cosmetics - plenty of unique, weird and funny weapons, armor/clothes.+ Manbearpig+ You can kick Al Gore's buttCons:- The fighting becomes repetitive at times, but only a minor complaint.Would recommend!

76561198007320695,Recommended,213670,19014448,"Posted: 11 November, 2015",all,Sebidee,"Having just finished this game I can definitely say I highly recommend it. You will really love the cutscenes and story if you are a South Park fan, and the game is pretty fun too.Pros:Great cutscenes, lots of jokes and lots of easter eggs from South Park. Most south park characters will make an appearance in the game and it's always a good chuckle. This game is really like an extra long episode or even a second movie.Fun gameplay. In this game you do three things, you fight enemies in small turn based battles that are kind of like pokemon, the battles sound like they would be boring but they are actually quite fun since you have to use the right moves and need to time them perfectly. The second thing you do is explore south park searching for treasure, collectibles or easter eggs. Lastly you customise your character (a new kid to South Park) and dress him up in funny costums or with weapons and weapon patches that come with different bonuses.Battles are much better than you would expect, the battles are turn based and are very fun. You can use ranged weapons, melee weapons, magic (farts) or special abilities. You can set your enemis on fire, stun them, gross them out and send them to sleep. My favourite attack in the game is the Roshambo where you kick your enemy in the nuts! You also have companions with their own special abilities and playstyle.The story is also good. In the beginning you are playing a pretend fantasy game and all the boys in South Park are on one side or the other but later you need to fight a much bigger threat to the town. The fact that you start out playing a game within a game is pretty funny and the characters often reference it.The game is very well paced. It takes place over about 4 days, during the day time you do missions for the South park boys but at night time you do these huge boss missions. The game doesn't get boring and neither does the story as it quickly progresses. Certain secret areas of South Park also become avaliabe as you progress so you never really stop exploring.Style. The art style of the game is very good. It looks exactly like South Park does. Cutscenes are indistinguishable from South Park and the mini cutscenes for each character's special ability are very well done. The UI in batles looks nice and is easy to understand, as is the ingame menu where you customise your inventory, abilities and perks.Cons:The humour of the game is the same as South Park, it's very crude and vulgar. If (like me) you love South Park then you will love that kind of humour. But if you are not a South Park fan or have never watched it you might not enjoy the humour.Sometimes the objectives of missions aren't very well explained and you sometimes become lost when you don't know what to do, meaning that you have to google search the answer.The game is quite short and you should expect to finish it in a few days. I completed pretty much everything there is to do in the game in about 15 hours. I don't know if that is worth €30 so you should wait to pick it up on sale. (That's what I did and I got it for €7, which is great value)."

This is the game that south park fans deserve. I'll go over the positive aspects and the negative aspects.Positive:-This game is incredibly funny. It's raunchy and dirty sense of humor fits me so well. I love it. However, if you are not into that kind of humor, this game will not appeal to you.-The turned based combat would sound bad, and boring... But it actually has you involved. You don't just choose a move and then watch it play out. It's kind of like the Mario rpg games, where you have to put in some sort of actions to make a ""Perfect"" hit. The combat is also fairly fleshed out. There are status effects that can be inflicted on enemies. Also the unique ways each buddy can be used to suit your play style. You can even use the enviroment outside of combat using your abilities you get, such as your fart magic, and an anal alien probe. Skipping combat completely, but getting the experience.-Plenty to explore, and has some replayability. Although I never completed it after doing it twice.-It is creatively written. The story line is fantastic. Which it should be, being written by the developers of the show themself.-Due to the kids larping, it makes some creative items. You can literally take a crap in a toilet, and throw it at an enemy to gross them out.-The story line and all side missions can give you around... 20 hours, even more if you want to replay it.Negative:The negative aspects are just me nit picking a bit, but some of these can be an issue for others.-This game is for south park fans, and for people who are not easily offended. If you are not a south park fan? You might not enjoy this game, and not get most of the jokes.-The game is too easy on the default difficulty, and even on hard mode, it can be easy.

During the Autumn Sale I decited to give it a shot, and boy was I surprised.Playing the stick of truth kind of reminds me of games like Chrono Trigger, and as anyone of my friends know, I love me some Chrono Trigger.Positives- First off the game is full of personality, which is almost absent in modern gaming.- It's like an episode of South Park in an 13-20 hour game, and it's always finding a way to make you smile and chuckle, and some stuff just had me lol like crazy. Course it's using offensive humor to make you laugh, and it does it without mercy, and it's genious.- Combat is fluid, and it does a good job on making you want to plan out how are going to take down the opponent.The only real negitive I can think about is that I wish there was a way to obtain goods in a better fashion, if you didn't stock up eariler before you can't turn back, which will more then likely happen during your first playthrough you might be in a pickle.During the entire bedroom sequence it took me a good while to get out of there because I was un-prepared and I had to go into every fight with no healing items.Sure you could say that it was my fault, but how was I suppose to know about theunderware gnomesand what they will do to you.Overall South Park Stick of Truth is a great RPG and a great game in general, if your looking for a solid RPG and something  that will make you laugh your♥♥♥♥♥off.

,Recommended,213670,25832280,"Posted: 2 October, 2016",all,Antwog,"South Park: The Stick of Truth is a fantasy-RPG game developed by Obsidian Entertainment and published by Ubisoft. It was released in March 2014. The game is set in South Park, where your family recently moved to South Park. You play as ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, who is instructed by his dad to make friends, which allows him to meet Butters and join the world of fantasy and the fight for the Stick of Truth. This review will cover the campaign, the gameplay, and the open-world aspect.CampaignSouth Park features a good campaign. The campaign is open-world and this involves main missions that advance the story and optional side-missions that do not overly amount to anything useful. I completed the game in roughly 14 hours, which most of this time was dedicated to the main missions. The overall campaign was beautifully constructed. It easily followed the atmosphere of the television show in which Cartman, Kyle, Stan, and Kenny are the protagonists. I also noticed that like any adaptation, the game tries to incorporate those memorable skits from the show into the game, such as the aliens invading South Park and Mr. Poo. Furthermore, the game uses comedy and humour to lighten the environment because the developers expertly created a serious-tone with the battle of the Stick of Truth. The comedy does not feel forced so it hits a nice medium for comedy and seriousness. For instance, during character selection you can choose between four classes that have different abilities. I ultimately went ''thief'' but when I would click Jew, Cartman would tell me ''I guess we can't be friends then'', which personally was hilarious.The missions individually are not repetitive and are not overly long because within a main mission there are smaller missions within, giving you constantly new objectives and new experiences with the game. South Park also features occasional choice-making that changes the narrative of the game in missions. I personally enjoyed the campaign and found barely any faults. As a moderate fan of South Park I expected wittiness and comedy and that delivered and I loved all of the characters. I did experience some negatives, particularly at the lack of explanation for useful abilities throughout the game, which made me have to google it or guess it a few times. I did feel as if the campaign dragged throughout the middle-portion, particularly when visiting Canada within the game.GameplayThe game features unique turn-based gameplay. I don't experience much turn-based gameplay in these sort of RPG games so I found it to be refreshing. The turn-based gameplay also incorporates effects. For instance, in one fight I had a burning boomerang and when I used it, it hurt the opponent but set them on fire so when they would attack me, they would lose a portion of their health. South Park has a variety of weapon abilities to improve your damage or versatility. Fights incorporate fourth grade humour. For instance, to restore a large amount of your health you would eat a box of cookies. If you wanted to get a speed boost, you would drink Tweek's coffee. These little things add to the overall South Park tone which I think improves the experience of the game. I also like the aspect of as you get stronger and gain levels, your enemies get stronger. This progressive system allows the game to become more difficult as it goes on and to better utilise more strategy to win fights, because it's better than a static system where enemies will always have the same health and abilities.Open-World AspectSouth Park is an open-world game. So, the game beautifully showcases a South Park that includes Starks Pond, City Hall, Token's rich house, and Kenny's poor house. The map is very large and uses Timmy as fast-travel to help reduce the annoyingness of constant travel between one end of town and the other. There are very few locked houses but the majority of buildings can be entered, allowing you to search and find useful things and also grasp the geographical area of South Park. Therefore, I feel the use of open-world benefits the game because it allows the developers to incorporate more stuff from the show into the game.ConclusionSouth Park is a strong game. My review is not as in-depth as I would have preferred due to Steam's word limit but what I covered is the basis of it. You're playing an open-world South Park game that incorporates television show elements and character development into a fantasy setting. It features turn-based gameplay that incorporate 4th-grade humour to provide a better South Park feel to the game. It features geographical locations that resemble the show, which you can explore most areas. I personally felt it dragged in the middle-portion as all Ubisoft games do and provide a lack of tutorial throughout the game. I purchased this game for $7.49 on sale and if you're a moderate South Park fan, buy it on sale. But, if you really like South Park I totally recommend this at $33 because you get value out of it and have fun while playing it.Rating7.75/10Pros- The atmosphere of South Park.- Storyline development.- Comedy and humour.- Unique fighting system.Cons- Tends to drag at various portions throughout the game.- Very forgettable side-missions.- Rushed ending.If you found this review helpful, please give it a thumbs up.

One of my favourite games of all time, I've already done 3 playthroughs and it's a blast everytime. Criminal that Ubisoft are developing the next South Park game as Obsidian really hit the nail on the head with this one.As a huge fan of the show since I was very young, one of my favourite parts of this game is just exploring the town by yourself and getting lost in all the funny side content and locations.The main story is also excellent and the combat is extremely well thought out and fun. Quirky attacks and canonical nods make the turn-based combat really interesting and functional despite hilarious. The gameplay is solid, disregarding the fact that it's a South Park game. The game stands up on it's own merit's as a strong turn-based RPG-inspired adventure game with a mostly open world."

It's undeniably and unequivically the best use of a television IP adapted into a game, hands down. The writing is spot on, and it's truly a love-letter to all long time South Park fans. There's so many references that even the most diehard fans will miss a few.What makes this game really amazing is that not only is the South Park lore respected so completely, it's that it's actually fun. The story pulls you in, and that's something I didn't expect. The RPG mechanics are solid - combat is never a bore or a chore, and it's pretty amazing to shove a kindergartner up your♥♥♥♥♥as Mr. Slave.How many other games can you say that it's fun to shove a kindergartner up your♥♥♥♥♥ That's what I thought. That's what makes this game unique, it's offensive and doesn't care. It's brash, and true to itself, and for that, I have to say I'm having a ton of fun. Some people have complained about the length only being 20 hours for the 60 dollar price tag, and I can only tell you that you're well-off ignoring them. Since when do we put an abitrary length measurement on fun? 20 hours of sensational bliss for 60 dollars beats 60 hours of somewhat-entertaining gameplay for 10 dollars, in my opinion.This is one of those games you actually remember at the end of the year."

,Recommended,213670,16614393,"Posted: 22 June, 2015",all,ThatDarnOwl,"South Park the Stick of Truth is a game I was really hyped for. A game made by one of my favorite developers, Obsidian, working on a South Park game. Which has been a television show that hasn't really had a good game up until this one.The things Stick of Truth does that impress me the most are that it works as both an adaptation of South Park and as a game in it's own right. There was clearly a huge focus on authenticity, down to how the aesthetic near flawlessly mimics that of the show. It's clear Matt and Trey had a very noticeable hand in the game's development. All of the humor is spot-on with that of the television show. Where they not only try to satirize common video game cliches, but also take advantage of them to make a very competantly made rpg.When I said it worked as a game as well I wasn't lying. The game is a turn based rpg, and this was an extremely smart decision on Obsidian's part. Because of the turn based nature to the combat you can have humerous moments like Al Gore putting your cleric to sleep with a powerpoint presentation. They also have small real-time elements where you press a button to block and attack at certain moments. It all works so well and it's phenominal to see such an attention to detail in a licensed game.I'm extremely glad the game lived up to it's hype. There are very few flaws worth mentioning with Stick of Truth beyond maybe the lack of replayability. But it really is a game that appeals to fans of the television show and people who want a turn based RPG that succeeds in making you laugh."

,Recommended,213670,14002181,"Posted: 15 January, 2015",all,Jive Soul Bone,"At its core,South Park: The Stick of Truthis a casual, story-driven RPG. More so than any other modern RPG, this game is driven on writing rather than any gameplay mechanics. And since this is South Park we're talking about, the writing consists of much shock humor and repeated WTF moments. In fact, I've come to accept that the game is so defined by its writing that any attempt at gameplay analysis is ultimately moot.Early on in my first playthrough, I thought I had discovered the optimal configuration of weapons, equipment and patches that would allow me to break the game wide open. Then I realized this was NOTFinal Fantasyand such efforts were ultimately in vain. This is not a challenging game, even at Hardcore difficulty. The greatest mistake I made was searching the internet for that twelfth Timmy express flag and learning more than I wanted about the story. Whenever you read ahead, you lose the most important thing this game has to offer.There is little point in guides and walkthroughs in the first place. I suspect thatObsidianmade it easy for you specifically so you don't feel the compulsion to search out secrets on the internet in the first place. On a second playthrough and for achievement purposes, sure! But it's not entirely inaccurate to callSouth Park: The Stick of Truthan extended interactive episode of South Park where you are the hero. Except that it prompts the question: who pays 40 bucks for an interactive movie? This is strictly a Steam Sale purchase; put it on your wishlist, avoid all spoilers and wait.So, is it funny? Well YMMV but on the whole I'd pretty much say yes. You don't have to be a South Park aficionado to appreciate the game and this is coming from someone who hates the politics of the series. The in-jokes are mostly relegated to the articles of vendor trash you pick up across your journey and without giving anything away, the humor mostly comes from trope lampshading, many instances of WTF, a dedicated fart button and boss fight music.I really,reallywish you could do more with the combat system. There's a majority of enemy encounters that can be eliminated through clever interaction with the environment... but that just feels like cheating yourself out of more gaming content! You never have more than one party member at a time and can't even modify their stats/equipment, making for an extremely single character-centric RPG. Some people might have no patience for party management but this game is lacking in substance already, so any opportunity for customization would be welcome.I'd still recommend purchasing this game (20 bucks seems like a fair price) and experiencing it for yourself rather than following a Let's Play. There's plenty to discover in your small secluded mountain town and it's obvious that the developers spent a lot of time stuffing the whole place with secrets. South Park's distinctive ""cutout"" animation style and bright colors lends well to RPGs, making it easy to pick out which object you can interact with and the radial battle menu makes for clean, intuitive battles. Shallow as it is,South Park: The Stick of Truthmakes for an accessible RPG.Just don't do like I did and buy the DLC. It's all level 2 equipment which you quickly outgrow into irrelevance. Speaking of which, I think it's relevant to say that the ""treasure location"" panel on the world map is bugged, just so you don't go wasting 20 minutes searching for nonexistent items. Apart from all that, you're fine."

The Stick of Truth is not only the best south park game created, but the best game adaptation of cartoon or TV series as matter of fact, and that really says great things about the future of south park digital studios and Obsidian entertainment.This game is a steal at the price and I whole fully endorse it through and through, not only as massive fan of the show but as a gamer with more than 2 decades of consistent gaming under my belt and a love for RPG’s in particular.Ignore the criticism of the games ease and repetitiveness, both are integral to how the game is not only played but lived. There’s a good 15hours of main story without side quests and exploring, not to mention there will be some much welcome DLC on the way by the tell of the current map that will be every bit as grand as the release itself.

If you are a fan I certainly recommend it if you are not check the gameplay out first before making the choice. I got this one free with the preorder of the new game. Doesn't mean I didn't want to pay for this game at all. I have the xbox 360 version of this game that's why I didn't pay for it seperately on PC. Lastly the hours are sort of accurate to xbox and pc playtime combined since I did 4 playthroughs and most of the time I left the game running while I was studying for exams, oops, so don't be mistaken by the playtime it is accurate enough to make a review about it.This game has a lot of references to the South Park Universe also has a few to other things. In the intro I recall cartman looking like Gandalf the Grey from LOTR. The story is like you are in a South Park movie or an very extended episode for that matter. You can also expect the classic jokes and mockery that is in the series. In the game you also have access to Canada which gives me the feeling of playing an oldschool game. The ending of the game is so unexpected at the first playthrough that I laughed way harder than I should. I'm happy that this version was the uncensored one because my xbox version was censored. I'm doubting the decision if they needed the censored version. You could make a 12+ game as the censored and uncensored 18+ or so but you do not need to block countries with an older community by only giving out a censored game. Also for some reason the cutscenes can be doing some weird stuff like disappearing characters or grey screens with the subtitels.Probably because I have a lot of tabs open or alt tab a lot to make notes or because I got a facebook/steam message.Exploring the environment is worth it, you'll come across a lot more references and good items to equip. The game doesn't seem to support loads of back to back exploring because they game keeps track of how long you've been exploring, apparantly, and then when you explore for too long your buddy asks ""When we will continue our quest"" or something among those lines.The gameplay is pretty good, I'll be digging into some stuff deeper down below, I haven't really had problems with it aside from the control sets. You can't change them at all and some abilities require you to mash buttons which is harder on a keyboard or so. It could be useful when you could set your keys because each character requires different 'mashing', note: I'll be repeating that a lot sorry, to pull off abilities. Battles are good an active blocking system because some attacks are multiple or get executed slower or faster. Farting in this game is something they have worked on a lot in both games, refering to the nosulus rift for the next game, but in battles I didn't use it as much because I thought abilities did the job better. The summons in this game, you get them by doing side quests, are amazing and entertaining to look at when they instantly kill your enemies. The dificulty of the game is okay, I played from easy to normal to hardcore to hardcore (beating final boss with dire aids and lvl 2 armour with decent patches), I think I rarely died either to misplays and I once needed a summon to stop me from dying against the same enemy. Talking about patches, or armour effects, there are some which work when you hold two handed weapons but I didn't really get when you can use those. When you go to your armour screen you see your guy holding a weapon in his one hand but when he moves he uses his two hands to hold his weapon, unless he doesn't do that with all weapons, I still don't get it honestly. There is replay value in this game due to the several classes you can play.Buddies:In the game you always, unless certain parts of the game, have a companion at your side from the usual South Park characters. I'll be listing them here and what abilities I find the most useful.Stan, a very useful ability for shredding armour until you get Cartman.- 2: an ability that hits the first row and does the same damage for a couple of seconds, high damage against non-armour.- final: like his second ability but it removes armour per hit and the last hit does the most damage and adds 2 bleeding.Jimmy, he's only useful for letting enemies sleep or his buddy command.- 2: the ability that puts them to sleepButters is a good early game buddy until you get Stan, his special heals you.- 2: applies shock damage to enemies in a row.- final: a combination of everything he has but with more damage and extra effects.Kenny, grosses them out a lot but is able to kill himself in two out of three abilities.- 2: you mash and unleash an army of mice, failed or not, if you failed kenny dies.- final: he summons an unicorn which damages a line and applies bleed, failed or not, if you failed kenny dies.Kyle, Almost equal to Cartman in terms of usefulness but almost doesn't give any debuff to enemies.- 1: he kicks his little brother ike at his enemy, only one, and damages them plus a bleed.- final: he summons an arrow storm, doing damage either way, if you fail the button combinations or not.Cartman, The most useful buddy to me in any type of battle.- 1: a fire damaging ability in a linewith a burn.- 2: applies fire damage to every enemy and strips armour and add fire damage, no burn.- final: a masher of all buttons, easiest masher there is, does a 500-1K damage per hit (5 hits). It can kill anything without decent armourClasses:Warrior, my favourite one probably because any ability fully upgraded is wrecking.- Assault and battery: good for any stage of the game, upgraded gives bleed per hit.- Roshambo: good for the early stages, a stun.- Bull rush: good against any boss, it halves their armour and pisses them off.- Horn of irritation: A debuff to all and also pisses them off, from what I remember.Corrections are welcome- Ground stomp: applies 2-3K damage to every enemy, very useful lategame.Jew, this is a button masher class, good for with a controller.- Sling of david: mashing, hits them pretty decent early but if failed you hit yourself a little.- Jew jitsu: lot of mashing again, good early game ability that stuns them on hit.- Circum scythe: easy to pull off ability and upgraded a really amazing ability.- Dreidle: button mashing fest, hits everyone for decent damage.- Plagues of egypt: an ability that almost does every debuff if done correctly pretty equal to ground stomp in terms of damage.Thief, you thought assault and battery didn't bleed enough? Think again.- Backstab: an ability that you can use anytime that gives bleed.- Mug: typical ability, that stuns and gives you an item they hold. Mostly junk.- Execute: good against non-armour.- Stink bombs: you mash your mouse button to throw rotten eggs, gives gross.- Death of 1000 cuts: bunch of ninjas attack, system like plagues of egypt but harder, you direct your ninjas to where they need to hit and give a bleed if hit correctly.Mage, probably the most diverse class loads of burns.- Dragon breath: a mouse masher that hits in a line and final hit does more damage. It applies burn if done correctly.- Dust of dreams: easy to do stun.- Lightning volt: electricity damage in a line.- Funnel of forest: line ability that slows, if held long enough (like kyle his second ability) and applies slow damage.- Pyre ball, the best ability in the game hands down. At least 4K damage and applying burn after tapping the same combination 4 times."

I'm going through my second playthrough, I'll workshop this as I go along.Pros:-Most of the children in South Park are playing a game... The most brutal ♥♥♥♥ing game of all time. Damn, I'm glad I didn't get beat up with a nail'd baseball bat when I played medieval as a kid-Insane amounts of little references to obscure things in the show. Hey, I remember that!-A ton of cosmetics to make your character exactly the way you want. You can look exactly like a number of characters from the show-Stays true to the hilarity of the show. It's basically a really long South Park episode-Infinite inventory slots, because inventory management really sucks-One companion at a time, can be swapped mid-battle. Each companion has different perks, strengths and weaknesses. Different companions depending on which faction you side with-It's really quite tactical, which is surprising-Fun dungeons-Customizable weapon stats, you can buy perks to attatch to clothing and weapons, and once you equip them, you can remove them without losing the clothing or the perks-Can color all of your armor to actually be yourself... No longer will you suffer non-matching color-schemes-Butters is enjoyable and useful this time... I'm gladSome serious cons:-Overabundance of money and healing items. You can have a max stack of 10 for each item, too bad there's multiple different brands of small/med/large health potions that do all the same thing, from basically the start of the game you could very well heal yourself every turn up until the end of the game, no joke-Even on the hardest difficulty, the game is easy. Unless you're playing for story only, you're going to need to make some of your own hardcore rules (exception of say, two fights)-That being said, unless you know exactly what you're doing and you can plan a few moves into the future-It's short. Holy hell it's short.-Warrior: Not experienced, but can taunt and focuses on mitigating a bunch of damage and being rather hard-hitting-Mage: Not experienced, but focuses on special moves and elemental damage (mainly fire)-Theif: Focuses on attacking back-line enemies (stunning and bleeding enemies in the back row), along with an armor-busting move. Great for people who can plan moves into the future.-Jew: Focuses on debuffs, incredibly, incredibly powerful/broken, I played it my first playthrough, take a Tweek Bros Coffee and circumsize every enemy for an instant win (nearly)"

The game visually is exactly the same as the show and on-point at that. The story is completely ridiculous, over the top, and extremely good. You are basically playing a long episode of South Park which is sick af. There seems to be a lack of soundtrack variety, but the soundtracks that are in the game are simply brilliant and are amazing which makes up for the minimal amount found in the game in my opinion. The game is a role-playing game and the RPG elements are surprisingly well thoughtout and very diverse for a game like this.

It's basically an interactive, twelve-hour episode (and in the best way possible).Stray Points:Zero replayability. Everything is samey and overly-simple for veteran players. Consider this a one-time investment (an excellent one if you can grab it during a sale).As noted above, if you're a fan, it's a must-own. That's because 70% of the appeal comes from the strange South Park mythos and all of the in-jokes and gags exclusive thereto. And, much like any quotationalist media, the more you know about the show, the funnier the game is. However, if you don't particularly like the show, you have absolutely no reason to play this game. If you have no idea what South Park is or have never seen an episode (i.e., You've spent most of your life living among wolves or something), the humor may string you along until the end, but the gameplay really isn't enough to sustain interest, otherwise."

Final Fantasy and Skyrim are two i can name off my head. They're not exactly related to it but it has some references in the game that make you believe that.

Sadly I was always put off by the full price of £40. I waited until this years Summer sale and picked it up for £20 and was not disappointed.The game takes the style of a turn based combat title, much like Final Fantasy, but it is a much more mellowed down version. I was able to breeze through most combat situations without much attention being paid. The parts of the game which got me scratching my head were trying to work out how to proceed through each puzzle, often at times I had to refer to a walkthrough as I was starting to get a brain hemorrhage.The graphics and sound throughout the game are exactly the same as in the TV series, so if you enjoy that, you will certainly feel at home here. The ever so crass South Park esk jokes and one liners are here for the world to marvel at.Story wise, again, very much a South Park episode, you will almost feel like you are watching the show while playing. The length of the main story is about ten hours long, some may disagree but I think that is a little short for a game at full price of £40, but there are plenty of side missions and achievements to go hunting for if that is your thing.If you are lucky enough to find this game on sale for anything under £20. I would certainly recommend you give it a try if you have ever enjoyed the TV show, however you may not fully appreciate it. Certainly is not worth full price. But for the price I have paid, I still really enjoyed my playthrough."

The gameplay is easy to pick up, it's funny, and it doesn't bore you when nothing is happening in the story. The story itself, however, is pretty ♥♥♥♥ing hilarious. Not only that, it's deep and very immersive, which was kind of a nice surprise for a South Park game of all things. I've also enjoyed the game very much, finding all the easter eggs and references is a pretty fun thing to do while you're taking a break from story missions. There's also a ton of side-missions, so you won't be completely done story-wise after the main story is completed, there's plenty more to do.In regards to other gameplay elements and characters, Timmy is the best fast-travel system I've ever used. You have a few companions (or buddies as they're called in-game) to help you on your journey, as well as in every fight. Some of the ones early on are characters like Butters, Kenny, Jimmy, etc. It's great. And if I'm not mistaken, nearly every character in South Park is in this, even the one's that aren't most likely have at least one reference to them.You can clearly tell the devs cared about this game. I'm very satisfied with it, and I'm sure any other fans will be too.

,Recommended,213670,35038407,Posted: 17 September,all,Chocolate Sailor,"Overall score: 7/10Did I get my money's worth?: YesRecommended input: ControllerWith the majority of the reviews for South Park: TSoT being from fans of the show, I'm writing as someone who has never taken interest in South Park, critiquing The Stick of Truth for what it is: a video game.OverviewTsoT is a turn-based RPG with the primary selling point being that it takes place in the world of South Park, a show known for its crude humor. You play as a new kid moving into the town and are able to select from one offour classes, Warrior, Mage, Thief, and Jew - yes, there is a Jew class. From what I understand, the game is more or less the same regardless of your choice of class, but your equipment and abilities will vary depending on your choice, which is cool. In battle, you will usually have a buddy of your choice, each one being very different and some of them having uses outside of combat. Playing comfortably,the main story has about 7-8 hours of gameplay with probably about 6 hours more of side contentin the form of missions and other activities, like searching for collectables.The goodThe Stick of Truth's combat system is pretty straightforward andjust about anyone should be able to pick up and play the game. I find the combat to be mostcomparable to Legend of the Dragoon or the Mario & Luigi RPG gamesfor Nintendo handhelds, both being series' I've enjoyed. TSoT features many things that RPG fans can expect to see from an RPG, likedifferent classes, abilities, items, and choice of strategy. Most of the game takes place outside of combat, which is just as enjoyable. The area that the game takes place in is densely-packed and there'splenty of incentive to explorethe world and talk to NPCs.I can happily say thatthe use of buddies is one of the best things about the game. Each one was very well made and fun to use. In order of unlock, you're given Butters the paladin, Kenny the seductress, Stan the warrior, Jimmy the bard, Kyle the war chief, and Cartman the wizard. Each buddy brought their own tactics to the battle and they were fun to experiment with. Butters was the buddy I used most of the time, due to his ability to heal, damage many enemies at once, and deal reasonable damage to armored targets.Deserving of its own paragraph is the fact that TSoT isone of very few RPG games where grinding isn't necessary. Personally, I enjoy grinding, at least to an extent, but many complaints about other RPG games is the need to grind or the impossible difficulty of the story missions without completing some side missions for added rewards.The badTSoT is a bitspoon-feedy with its difficulty curve. With the lack of need to grind, I never found myself in need of anything. My level was where it needed to be or higher, I always had great gear acquired normally through the story, I was never in need of potions (very often reaching capacity limits on many of them) and I ended the game with waaaay more money than I needed. In most turn-based RPG games, you can either attack or use an item. TSoT allows you to do both as well as doing the same with your available buddy. With resources being nearly free, being able to heal to full health AND attack twice in one turn leaves very little for challenge. Going a step further, your buddy can both use their ability and attack, giving you free healing, stat boosts, or added damage every turn. With having Butters as my buddy, I could heal to full health with just one nearly free item and still get both attacks or abilities. To make things even easier, once you have at least two buddies available, you can use a buddy's turn to switch them out. Once your buddy is low on health, you can have them switch to another buddy with full health and mana. Your main character is already very strong as it is, everything I mentioned here isjust to make the game even easier. The Stick of Truth gives you a lot of options to cheese your way through the game,reducing the overall enjoymentof the game. At this point,I'd rather have to grindthan just be handed the win.Fans of South Park go absolutely nuts over the humor, but I found it to be very hit-or-miss. There were some jokes about Jews or black people that made me smile and I gave the occasional chuckle at how wild the game got at certain points (like fighting giant nazi zombie fetuses), but half the time the humor is just ""haha poop and FARTS xD"" which made me sigh quite a lot. I don't expect this type of humor to change and I'm positive I'm in a minority here, butthe game as a whole really wasn't that funnydue to these constant dips in quality.Other things you should knowAt normal price, TSoTcosts $30 which is way too much. Fortunately the game gets marked down for as much as 75% off during sales and TSoT was a featured game in April 2016's Humble Monthly Bundle, which is how I got it. I enjoyed the game, but it certainly isn't worth regular price. If you are thinking about buying TSoT, I urge you to wait for a good sale."

If you don't watch the show... well this game is probably not for you as it kind of sits on top of a great deal of the Tv show's adventures and will use characters from the show that may seem confusing or strange (underpants gnomes, aliens and such).On the other hand if you enjoy the show a lot and weren't sure, then... well I suppose I'll finish the review.The Stick of Truth creates a world where the children of South Park are playing a version of Dungeons and Dragons, where one side is Humans and the other side is elves.   And the Player is quickly recruited by Cartman, to join the Kingdom of the Kupa Keep.  And Cartman is the Grand Wizard of the KKK.... and from there, most readers should have what they need to know.To put it simply, this is an amazing game.  I've never felt that a game was so well crafted.  While the game runs about 20 hours to do anything, it still feels like the player is playing a very long episode of the show, and while it relies on a few jokes that the show has already told, and most of the songs heard in the game are from the show, the player feels like a character inside the show, and for a 2d show that was originally made out of cardboard cutouts, that's a pretty impressive accomplishment.So really that's the question.  Do you want to play a longer episode of south park with a completely original story, but numerous call back to the show or episodes?   With combat that always stays true to the source material, and a world lovingly crafted?And honestly, The answer was yes for me.  I love South Park, I love the Stick of Truth, and I'm heavily looking forward to the Fractured But Whole.  So I recommend this game, but will say that recommendation is pretty much only to fans of the show."

If you have seen south park and disliked it however, this game isn't going to be for you, as the strongest point really is the humor and characters. The voices are the same and the entire game is filled with references. So many references to episodes that I ended up surprised that going number two in a urinal with mr mackey nearby didn't give me any special comment from my companion. Which I didn't expect going into the game, but again... There was so many minor characters or item references in the game.I enjoyed every minute of my first playthrough as a fan of the show. (Just for the record far from the biggest fan, since there are a lot of episodes I haven't seen, and I am sure there were references to those that I missed.) Chances are that you will see your favorite character at least make an appearance.The combat is turnbased rpg with each character having different abilities and moves. And the abilities require different forms of excecution sometimes button mashing, hitting the right keys, click or hold the mousebutton, but each ability tell you how to execute it before you cast it, so it is nice and manageable.As for the story... It is southpark, don't expect the characters' actions to be logical. And the fewer questions you ask the better. Just enjoy the ride and expect that everyone around you is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ or an idiot, or both.So yeah, if you like south park's humor, then buy this. If not... Then run. Really, this game isn't holding back on any of the jokes, and it is really immature and gross in its comedy. Because of south park's style I feel they can get away with more, because nothing really looks realistic in the slightest but still. If you think South Park's humor and characters are too offensive, then this game won't help.For me this is a great game, probably among my favorites because i enjoyed the entire experience. Which means, that the nitpicks I have are more... wishes for more features in future games. I wish that you could be a bit more unique character than just one of the normal boys. Maybe let you be a canadian boy, or a fatass like Cartman. Or let you be a girl, or a fat girl like the goth Henrietta. Is it needed? Probably not, but I would like it. I also would have loved more weird classes, like the Jew class already in the game. Maybe getting a princess/girl class like Kenny. Or a vampire class. Also would have loved just more. More of everything! :P I am finished, I want another.____On another note, that is not really a part of the review. The next game is called South Park: The fractured but whole. And this time they are going to be superheroes instead of humans and elves. And while I think the combat will be different, I think it is much like this one going to be dripping with the humor of south park. Preordering it means you get the stick of truth ""for free"" right away. Personally I see it more as paying 30 for each instead of 60 for one. Can't say if the next one will be good, but I loved the episodes I have seen in the show where they dressed up as superheroes.I know Cartman says the only thing you get for preordering a game is a big fat♥♥♥♥♥♥in your mouth.

,Recommended,213670,11044585,"Posted: 2 July, 2014",all,Littlepip™,"It'd be difficult to explain exactly why this game is so great without major spoilers, so I won't take that approach. Instead, I'll say some of the same things everyone else already has. It's like actually playing a season of South Park with your custom character, and the combat employs action commands ala the various Super Mario RPG titles and Shadow Hearts.While some of the humor falls flat, and there's a certain thing repeated a few times early on, the vast majority succeeds in prompting laughter, which is more than I can say for most media which claims to be comedic nowadays. At the same time, it's brutally self-aware, not only of it's status as an RPG, but as a South Park videogame. The voicework and animation is spot on with the show, and, honestly, if you didn't know it was a game, you'd think it WAS an episode or movie.Speaking of which, there's references to the movie along with the entirety of the show's 17+ year run, and yes, even music, which Matt & Trey are surprisingly talented at. The game's soundtrack takes on an absurdly epic style, with several of the main themes being very similar to that of ""real"" fantasy titles, like Skyrim, and with good reason. It also has a strong Earthbound vibe to it, because of the whole ""kids using toys to inflict terrible damage to hostile and weird enemies"" along the way.It's not perfect; unless you turn the difficulty all the way up, you'll likely breeze through 90% of the battles, and it's very easy to hit the low level cap. There's also a number of game-breaking attack combos you can learn with every class, and debuffs are so powerful that they're practically mandatory. But it's all worth it. Despite these problems, I've spent nearly 100 hours in the game, as I went through multiple playthroughs, and didn't regret a minute of it. Well, except for those minutes with the repeated thing I won't mention early on, that is.Oh, and no major spoilers, but I HAVE to share a minor one, which should tell you just what kind of game this is. The hardest boss, by far? Not the last one, or even the next-to-the-last one, both of whom can be tricky. But no.. it's Al Gore.I'm super cereal you guys."

I was wary of this one for some time because usually licensor titles have huge flaws, but luckily this one's are minimal: The options are terrible, you can't rebind keys or do other basic functions you'd expect on a PC game. The whole feel is of a lame console port. The controls are a bit confusing since the console version relied on sticks, which keyboard/mouse users don't have. Some of the companions are embarrassingly weak, while Kyle is downright overpowered in almost all situations.But with the bad out of the way, it's a pretty good game. Naturally it requires that you've seen a lot of South Park to know 90% of what's going on, but it has the feel of a playable South Park episode. It has a script written by Parker and Stone, it's filled with eye-buldging moments, eye hiding moments, and WTF moments that you'd expect from South Park.  Think of it as a DVD with lost episodes, only they're playable...and they kind of resemble the three-part episode they did around Black Friday 2013.But don't expect a lot of replay value out of it.

I knew they were capable game creators but they ended up crafting not just a good game but a great South park episode. You see and visit the whole town with enough interesting set pieces to stop the game becoming stale. Sewers, homes, streets, very small government facilities, very large bedrooms and...well lets just say something that will fly over peoples heads. The really ingenious aspect is having the whole game set whilst all the children in the town are fully engaged in a live action roleplay game pretending to be in a fantasy world of wizards and elves.What would have been perfectly acceptable as a storyline takes repeated twists and turns, upping the ante until you would need someone like Morgan Freeman to come out and calmly narrate what the hell is going on. Yet at this point it's too late. You're smile is fixed and it's not going away until the credits roll.They ended up crafting not just a good game but a great South Park episodeThe classes seem to end up having less of an effect on how you play but the animations that occur once you perform certain class specific moves. Weapons and armour have noticable differences in abilities and customization allows a suprisingly deep level of item managment. Much like in other games you will feel the pain of loss for replacing your favourite weapon for a statistical upgrade despite the fact you think it looks worse. Only in this game your favourite weapon will, coincidentally, probably end up being your mothers favourite as well.Gameplay wise Obsidian have crafted a game that absolutely nails the basics but feels to abandon any attempt at advanced tactics or strategies. Whilst you can certainly use items and afflictions to your advantage there doesn't appear to be further challaenges aside from rushing down the apponenet and instead a greater impact is placed or interacting directly in combat in the form of quick time events. Quick time events are usually the bane of any game but here they are used in combat for boosts to attacking and defedning, spicing up what would otherwise be an animated menu selection into almost a rythm combat game. Somehow it all justworks.Possibly the most underrated and least talked about part of this game is how it won't take your life away. Everyone is familiar with the Bethesda epics like Skyrim, or the Witcher series by CD Projekt RED but so often these games feel like the save file is something you keep as part of your lineage. Handing down to your son when he comes of age and he too will pass it on to his son. That's great for a lot of people for a lot of reasons, but I'd also like games I can completely experience without needing to take half a year off work. South Park can be comfortably completed in under 25 hours and that includes all sidequests and collectibles. If this feels like bad value for money then we will have to fight, just remember to wait your turn."

Fans of the South Park series will love this game because of the refrences from the episodes of South Park layered in the game from the radio, characters, and much more. The gameplay is turn based with the player's charater and companions having to interact with thier desired move by timing mouse clicks or button presses at the right time. This mechanic makes the turn based gameplay a bit more interesting then choosing the desired attack by making players interact more in battle. It wouldn't be South Park without making fun of something or someone so the game makes fun of famous game titles like Skyrim with the use of 'dragon shout' by farting on players, which can be combined with your other attacks or used to interupt an enemy charging up their special attack. There are four classes to choose from one of them being the Jew class that can actaully be overpowered at times, but is a funny reference to one of the original characters from the south park series. The problems i have with this game are some of the achievements being difficult, some actions freezing up causing players to load from last save, and bad implemintation any replayability. The achievements are not only difficult but ridiculious because forgeting to talk to certain people to be on your friends list or missing a complete set of armor means having to restart the entire game to get back to the point you missed. The character freezing has happend only a few times but not manually saving before hand may cause people hours of backtracking as it only loads manual saves instead of auto saves. Replayability of this game is weaksauce as the end of the game is free roam with limited areas to go to and nothing really to do but walk around and finish up certain achievements. A new game plus would have been good here but I think the developers did this intentually so players would have to start over as a new character to get more hours out of this game. Overall this game is great even with some of the gripes mentioned. Fans and non fans of the South Park series will really enjoy this game unless you don't like crude humor then this might not be your game. I strongly recommend this game for the sheer fun and laughter it gives to players and hours of fun it has to offer. If you can get this game at a reduced price even better!"

South Park has had one of the most crapiest line of games  until this installment. Pros and Cons ♥♥♥♥♥es.Pros:1) Funny as hell. This game will leave you in stiches.2) Solid 2-D scrolling graphics.3) Plays like any old school RPG games.4) Storyline is just like watching an episode of South Park. Your character is apart of the show, the star even.5) straight forward not much explaination needed, even if you do need helpful hints from time to time very easy to understand.6) The game may and will offened you.7) Just having the power to fart on anything is just fun.Cons:1) One day I will play this game then 4 weeks go by and i remember ""Oh yeah I have this game"" (that is of course you have the time to play the game straight through).2) The block control can be a bit chanllenging in trying to get use to the system.3) Kind of wish there was more dialog from some favorite characters like Randy Marsh or City Chicken guy.Yea not much hate on this game really just nit picking. This game does get repetative but if you just in it for the jokes you wont be disappointed. Like i said this Game had me in stiches with some of the stuff going on. I definitly recommend buying this game. However as I right this very late review the second installment for South Park the Fractured  Butwhole (lol) will be released soon and with it a free copy of Stick of Truth.

,Recommended,213670,14038027,"Posted: 17 January, 2015",all,somebody336,"Stick of Truth is a turn based RPG which has you exploring the town of South Park while the kids in town are waging a pretend war between humans and elves. We play as a silent protagonist known as “new kid” and quickly gets forced into the fake war due to his inability to talk. In that time they will learn you have an amazing ability to fart and declare you are Dragonborn. Yep, very much South Park humor and flawlessly brought over from the show. For those that don't know what South Park is or have never seen it, it is a comedy show that loves to use very offensive humor toward religion, homosexuals, abortions and pretty much anything under the sun. If you get offended over those type of jokes don't play this game because it holds no punches back and features nudity, sex, bestiality and stuff that may get this review taken down if I mention them due to the extreme nature of the acts. Nonetheless, it is a very good thing they didn't censor anything adapting the shows humor into a video game.But how is it as a game, you may be asking by now. Well it is pretty entertaining at first as you see what wacky moves characters have and the battle dialogue is still fresh but lose their charm after the 50th time and is further worsened due to some abilities you need to button mash on. It's not all bad though, you can can block an enemies attack if you press the guard button at the right time to lessen the damage you receive and that feature really lends the fights more interactivity and a big reason to pay attention instead of just lazily selecting moves from a list all the time. The strategy never gets too deep considering you can only have one ally fighting with you but that may be for the best, even being outnumbered the game is a tad on the easy side. When you are not fighting you will be exploring South Park and helping characters with their problems. After looting all their drawers of course.Money isn't really hard to get if you like looting through every shiny object you pass by. With that cash you can buy items, armor and weapons which is pretty standard for RPGs. The difference in this is that all objects are unique so you wont be finding a similar looking weapon with just higher stats. You will get your hands on stuff that a child probably could at first like lighters, dodge-balls and wands but eventually get your hands on pretty dangerous objects like hammers or knifes. On top of that you can enchant your weapons to add status effects. It also features a pretty simply upgrade tree and perks you can get by adding friends on Facebook, usually by helping them with a quest. You traverse through the town in a 2D background but can move between the background and foreground like a regular 3D game. There are also occasional puzzles which usually involve farting on something and will usually lead you to one of the games many collectibles.Graphics in this game capture  the feel of the show flawlessly. Everything looks like it was made of paper cutouts and all walk in the same low budget style of the show for that signature South Park charm. Attacks are well animated and the high level abilities are always a joy to watch especially Kenny's. Characters all look like in the show and seeing them dressed up in medieval gears is amusing. The town all looks the same and they managed to connect the areas seen in the show into a natural feeling world map. User Interface is simple and efficient but the screens to access gear and skills is a bit cluttered. Enemy variety is pretty good but including elves, rats and all matter of crazy stuff that I won't mention to avoid spoilers. Also male genitals have quite a bit of detail to them having hairs and veins etc. Is that a good feature? I don't know that depends on the person..Sound design is also flawlessly brought over from the show. Every character has their original voice actor and they don't half♥♥♥♥♥their roles in this game. The music is very South Parky including epic background music of Cartman singing about the Jewish. Sounds effects all sound very well done especially the blocking sound effect that sounds like steel clashing even though there is no steel. Stores feature some songs from the show like “Vote or Die” which I found hilarious listening to that in a Chinese restaurant.  Only bad thing I can say about the sound is that characters start moaning after you don't press a button for about five seconds or when you are not doing quests which is funny at first but quickly got pretty annoying.Story feels like one really awesome special episode of South Park. From start to finish it takes unexpected and often hilarious turns in true South Park fashion. Even the side-quests have their own funny mini stories with characters that don't get air time on the main plot. You travel to bizarre places in this game outside of the town of South Park including Canada for the silliest reason. It is quite hilarious seeing how seriously characters take their pretend war and the Stick of Truth which is said to control the universe. I won't explain much more about the story but believe me it captures the soul of the show perfectly.Stick of Truth lasted me about 12 hours and I estimate it would last 14-15 if you want to complete everything. It was the perfect length and kept the plot-line from getting stale or the combat to get boring. I don't really see a reason to replay it unless you want to try a different class and are going for achievements. It is a really solid RPG for those looking for a game filled with dark humor or can tolerate it. This game completely captures the soul and style of the show in every conceivable way and is without a doubt a must have for fans of the show."

It was an adult comedy series that joked coarse and tasteless with everyone and everything, while it was sharp social satire far more daring than ""The Simpsons"".Although it has dropped a couple of ""South Park"" games, none of those have had the blessing from creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker. that's one of the reason they set out to create ""South Park: The Stick of Truth ,"" in which they both wrote the script.In the Colorado town of South Park played out a bizarre story, where the TV show's most prominent figures - Cartman- Kenny - Stan - Kyle - playing fantasy war. On the ""magician Cartman's"" backyard, people have their base while "" Elvenking  Kyle"" harboring elves, and they fight over a tree stick called ""The Stick of Truth ."" You play a newly arrived nine year old who ends up in the middle of this death serious fantasy LARP . In typical ""South Park"" spirit the story takes an extra absurd turn when the town get's hit by a Nazi zombie virus.""The stick of truth"" is eerily like the original, with its expressive 2d graphics and its austere character animations. It really feels like ""South Park "": during the game, I get to interact with all the familiar characters, from Al Gore and goth gang to the Canadian duo Terrence and Philip.Although the story is wicked enough to be directly taken from the TV series, and scripted authors presence is palpable. The story is a mix of a sometimes incredibly entertaining operation with video-game conventions, social satire, American politics, infantile fart humor and tasteless joke.Sometimes it hits the humor just right and I choke with laughter: as when you finally get access to Canada and it appears to exist in 8-bit graphics, according to the old ""The Legend of Zelda "" formula. the jokes Sometimes miss the banter with the mile-long distance.The game has been censored in many countries worldwide. In particular two sequences , one of which takes place at an abortion clinic, and the other one which deals with♥♥♥♥♥♥ i did expect ""South Park"" to trample over all boundaries regarding which substances may be making fun about, but in the absence of satirical sophistication, as on these occasions, it becomes just sickening.It turns out to still be the meta fun and sometimes sharp script, along with the familiar characters carrying the game. Despite its twisted storyline and sick humor is ""The Stick of Truth "" namely a surprisingly standardized role play, with turn-based battles and focus on upgrading your armor. Although the childish armor and weapons makes me gigg. the fights quckly become repetitive.The fighting takes a long time, and I tire soon to dull stare at the same attacks again and again. The missions you should perform is even more monotonous, as most is to knock down a certain number of enemies or collect a certain number of gadgets. It is a boring and totally uninspired design.Although the game has its brilliant moments, it is uneven. Sure it's fun to watch ""South Park"" realized properly in the game medium, but it nowhere near as clever and thoughtful as I d expected."

South Park: The Stick of Truth is a funny, well made game that fits snuggly inbetween both examples above.  I finished the game after about 10 hours of playing, which is very respectable, and provides you with juuuust enough that, perhaps later on, you'll pick up a mouse and keyboard (Or controller) and try it again. The dialogue is hilarious, the gameplay is good, and Mr. Slave's... ""storage"" is scary. You can meet all your more known South Park characters, like Randy Marsh, Mr. Hankey, The Underpants Gnomes... Jesus... But its not necessary to do so, and you can just go along the story without giving a damn. I did not stray from the main quest, and to reach 10 hours with minimal sidequest completion is great. You don't have to go into places you don't want to, either. I know you can enter the sewers, but I decided not to unless the game forced me, after a long history of playing games with forced sewer gameplay. I was quite happy that I didn't have to go at all. As a result, I didn't meet The Christmas Poo, but I could live with that.The idea of a silent protagonist was obviously going to be a difficult thing to pull off, and South Park Studios and Obsidian Entertainment have pulled it off successfully. So congratulations to them. One thing I was unhappy with was the abilities, and how the were performed. almost everything involved mashing buttons on the keyboard or mouse. Wanted to poop? Mash a button. Want to use Jimmys abilities? Mash a button. Want Cartman to fat? Mash a button. It was very tedious and something I never really wanted to do after a while - But in order to win against many opponents, you needed to either A: mash these buttons, or B: use the normal attack, which did absolutely pitiful amounts of damage lategame. If you resorted to option B, you STILL have to press buttons, only this time, instead of mashing, it was timed with little ""Ding"" sounds, and a little flashing light. After a while, you could play the game with your eyes closed. In fact, to test this, I beat the final boss with my eyes closed (Except for the finale, which isn't really a battle. But I won't spoil it).Is the game good? I'd say so.Is it replayable? Maybe after a while.Do I recommend it? Well, if you don't mind mashing singular buttons, which are being timed against you, and are occaisionally difficult to pull off (such as creating♥♥♥♥♥♥Nuggets), then I guess its worth the money."

Hardcore RPG players may not enjoy it as much as it sort of feels like it is on rails, but there are still a lot of secrets to uncover.  The fighting system is done in the same vein of JRPGs, but it knows it's other RPGs well. It makes fun of the things you always think about in an RPG while being what it does best. Offensive, Abusive and very very sexually crude.  It's Southpark and if you are a fan of it even slightly. You will appreciate this game.  I personally was not expecting very much from it. I was hoping to laugh, but I got so much more from it. It made me laugh more than I think I have laughed during a game before.  It shows that Trey and Matt really did the right thing by standing by it's side during the making of it.  I have heard a lot of people saying that the game is only 14 hours long. I have played it longer than that by looking for secrets and getting everything I can out of the game.  I have also hear that there is no replay ability with the game.  I disagree.  Reason being.  I felt like i was actually IN Southpark.  I would say it's like playing a hillarioius movie.  If you like a movie. You are gonna watch it again.  If you like Southpark.

As an established South Park fan I guess I was always going to go into this game with an apologist mindset trying my hardest to love the game; hoping that maybe after a poor track record, like every other licencesed property in the games industry, that the game would be even half to South Park what Arkham Asylum was to Batman. I did not expect this.I ******* loved this game, and was overwhelmed with a sense of dread and sadness as I neared its conclusion, very few games have triggered that reaction. The characters, humour, graphics, animations, plot, soundtrack and general feel of the game were all absolutely nailed and I can't think of a single major flaw with the game. The closest I can get to a flaw is the length, people blasting through the main story as fast as possible might finish the game in just 8-9 hours, those who stretch it out with exploration, side quests and farting on as many people as possible can push above 25 hours in a single playthrough but when you compare that with the 100+ hours of a lot of other open world RPGs it DOES leave you wanting more. However, I'm left wondering whether that's better when compared to how Skyrim and Fallout 3/New Vegas, three of my favourite games ever, simply petered out for me, eventually withering away into boredom and eventual uninstallment whereas I'm being dragged away from South Park kicking and screaming. Die young and all that.This isn't a game for only the most die-hard of fans, in fact the only people I wouldn't recommend the game to are the fuddy duddies who despise South Park and its humour, either getting offended by it or simply not finding it funny in the least. This is not the game for such fuddy duddies. For everyone else though, this game is amazing and completely worth the £40/$60 in my opinion, they could have retroactively charged double and I would still have paid it."

,Recommended,213670,14215145,"Posted: 28 January, 2015",all,💀 La Smarka 💀,"If you're a fan of South Park, you NEED to get this game. I got it on sale, but honestly, it would have been worth the full price. I'm a huge fan of South Park and have been for years. I've seen just about every episode, many of them multiple times. In a way, this game is a tribute to the TV series. It references past episodes and characters and is very nostalgic at times. That alone hooked me. There's so much charm to this game, but perhaps the most charming thing about it is it's authenticity in relation to the show. It's like you're playing through an entire season of the series and you really feel like you're in South Park.Story:You're the new kid and your family just moved to South Park. Your parents encourage you to go outside and make some new friends. Soon after leaving your house, you meet Butters, who becomes your first friend and introduces you to The Wizard King, better known as Cartman. While there, you'll also meet Clyde, Scott Malkinson and Kenny...Princess Kenny. Cartman reveals to you The Stick Of Truth and explains that there is a war between the humans (Cartman's group) and elves (Kyle's group) who are each trying to possess the stick. During the explanation, Kyle's elves attack Cartman's base and your journey begins.Gameplay:The gameplay is really fun and very immersive. You start the game by editing your character's appearance to your liking. You can choose your hair style, skin tone, clothes, etc. And no, you can't play as a female. If you've ever played Paper Mario, this feels a lot like it. Your party consists of Cartman, Butters, Princess Kenny, Stan, Kyle and Jimmy. Each of them you will meet and acquire as you progress throughout the story. You can battle alongside one party member at a time, who each have different and unique abilities. There's even special friends you can summon to help you in battle once per day, which consists of Mr. Lu Kim, Jesus, Mr. Hankey and Mr. Slave. As you win battles and progress through the game, you'll gain XP and level up. Once you level up, you'll be able to upgrade your abilities. The game also puts a heavy emphasis on farting. That should come as no surprise to any fan of South Park. You'll learn different types of farts throughout the game that you can use both in and out of battle. You can't run from random encounters once you're in battle, but you can attempt to run from an enemy before the encounter in order to avoid it. This is very convenient because it gives you a chance to continue with whatever you're doing if you don't feel like fighting and it keeps the turn-based system from being an annoying pest like it is in other RPGs. The game offers many side quests and things to collect. Sure, you could just rush the game and complete the main story, but you'd be missing out on so much. There's a total of 120 friends to make. Many of them will ask you to do something for them before befriending you. There's also 30 chinpokomon to collect as well as equipment and weapons to find and purchase.The Negatives:When it comes to the negatives of this game, many have complained that it's too short. After beating the game, collecting every chinpokomon, making every friend and unlocking nearly every achievement, my save clocked in at 17 hours. However, this doesn't include the amount of time I've spent playing and loading past saves after losing in battle or to get something I missed or forgot about. So if we're counting all of that, Steam shows I put in 30 hours, which I would say is a good amount of time. I still would have liked for this to be longer simply due to how much fun I had with it. I had a feeling of sadness when the end credits came on because I didn't want it to end. Another complaint some have had is that you can only level up to level 15. On the surface this sounds annoying, but you'll easily defeat most enemies at this point and leveling higher would be unnecessary. Other complaints I have is that there were some characters and locations that weren't included in the game such as Raisins, Hells Pass Hospital, Grandpa Marsh, Satan, Towelie and Kyle's cousin. Also, there are some collectibles in the game that are only accessible during a certain quest, leaving them forever unobtainable if you forget to pick them up. So if you're a completionist or if you're very OCD about collecting things like I am, this can become upsetting. Overall though, the positives far outweigh the negatives and I'm sure that many of the negatives such as the missing characters and locations will be corrected if we get a sequel, which I'm URGENTLY awaiting by the way. Make it happen, Matt and Trey.Conclusion:If you're a fan of South Park, I'd HIGHLY recommend this. The game stays true to the TV series. It feels authentic because quite frankly, it is. You feel like you're actually playing out a season of South Park. The game offers a good story, immersive gameplay and lots of laughs along the way."

It packs in the same amount of cringe, curses, gags, nasty actions, and adult theme like the show.

Yes, it IS short, be warned about that beforehand, you'll finish the game in 25 hours if you take your sweet time, and you should, because what makes this game so good it's the amount of detail put into it. Rushing past everything would be playing this game wrong, this isn't to be played in a hurry. Actually, the game expects a little of thinking and observation from your part with a lot of puzzles, for example those optional ones to take down enemies without the need to fight them.Even if you're not a fan of the TV series or RPG's in general you'll find that this is a well made game, with a good flow both in history and combat. The battle and overworld mechanics are fresh, entertaining and feel just right. Obviously there is a lot of foul language and even things that people might find objectionable, but that and it's blend of comedy put into a videogame is what makes this one a unique experience you will never find elsewhere nowhere soon, because what the creators of this game took is a big risk, the kind of risk that videogame developers are less and less likely to take when it comes to games of this budget. Why? Because the game has no real replay value, all the effort that was put into this game, you will experience it in it's single run. No grinds, no replays, no hooks. If you're looking for a different experience when it comes to RPG's I really think you should give this one a try."

The combat is fun, out of combat is fun, the story is fun, and, of course, the characters are fun. It's entertaining enough that you can play while someone watches and they won't get bored (my girl sat through the whole damn thing). It's not very long though, which isn't so much a hit against it, as it was just the right length to pick up and beat in a weekend (along with all the side quests).I will also say that it's not very challenging however. The pacing promises that you will always have more abilities than you'll really know what to do with, money and items come easily, and if you pay enough attention to the mechanics to have a specific build, you will steamroll most encounters (although the enemy variety may muck you up if you're too focused around one subset of mechanics).If I had to gripe about anything, it would be the inventory which felt clunky, and was organized alphabetically rather than say by level (the name of an item doesn't really provide as much context as the level requirements).Totally worth the sale price.

As apposed to the majority of the half-a s s e d movie or TV show video game adaptations The Stick of Truth is just as brilliant as it's source material being South Park. Trey Parker and Matt Stone (creators of South Park) had a major involvement in the game creating all the story and dialogue, consulted on with the design, and they voiced many of the characters of the game and it's just brimming with personality. As for the combat and gameplay mechanics of The Stick of Truth, the battle system is surprisingly fun to use using timing with attacks meaning the combat requires you to participate. The abilities that are exclusive to each class are really fun and unique to use and do not go unused and are used frequently in battle as apposed to other RPGs which consist of turn based combat with the main use of neutral attacks. If you like South Park's bizarre and crude humour (whether or not you've been been a frequent watcher of the show) and also like RPGs this game is for you. It's really good, I'm super cereal."

Ive had many tense and tactical experiences while fighting nazi zombies, and nazi zombie...babies! This shows the writers, designers, and programmers came together to create comedy during extremely tense situations (the final boss omfg i wanted to kill myself it was so hard).CollectingOften I dont perticularly enjoy collecting items in games, it feels random, like it was thrown in to elongate the game. While collecting everything in this game elongates the game from 15 hours to about 18 hours every moments is fun and interesting. I became extremely excited each time i saw the llittle sparkle letting me know there was a new item nearby. Each item was either a great callback to an episode or a laugh out loud joke!WritingStoryOk. The entire rest of this game is amazing, but, have you ever watched a south park episode because of the compelling episode with twists and turns, no, you watch it for the funny jokes. Thats how I feel with this game. The story is obviously not terrible, but it could have been more developed.DialougeHERE WE GOOO! The main atraction of this game is the Dialouge, basically you are paying for a more expansive 18 hour episode of South Park. The dialouge between characters is natural and memorable. Any fan of the tv show will definetly be laughing every 15-30 seconds. Even if you have never seen the show or even dislike it you have to admire the expert writing.ConclusionFinal ThoughtsI love this game.

They generate this fantastic flow that - in one trick - justify the game pretense while engaging the player in it, epic battle throughout fake taverns and parental curfew taken in strides.When the world of 'normal' adult gets involved or when the game brings back some of the series lore along with stalwart tropes, it is far less successful: the veil of pretend falls and what's left is a giddy but dull self-awareness that highlights the least  flattering parts of the game structure.Chief of these is the turn based combat and its place in the progression: it allows for tedious conservatism (same moves all the time) instead of encouraging experimentation with your equipment and with your buddies during encounters. In the same way, the block system has very unreliable sign and feedback; which makes it difficult to use.Beside that, your mileage may vary: South Park has built several facets during its run and I don't care for the scat humor from the first seasons or the easy lampooning of popular culture icons that recent years have brought.Some people do and I expect they'll enjoy the game to through and through. I couldn't because what really interests me is the writers harsh tackling of controversial topics or of the darker aspects of the  logic and ecosystem that you'll find in a pack of kids. There's a significant amount of that (along with a nearly invisible touch of social commentary), but the scat and the pop-ref ARE what the last two thirds of the game ride on.And I can't support that choice: it makes the game less of a beast of its own - self contained, designed for the experience - and makes it rely on a bunch of crutches that are offputtingly obvious and ultimately unnecessary.The music is awesome though."

,Recommended,213670,11557278,"Posted: 4 August, 2014",all,Malloc,"It might sound like a backhanded compliment to call something ""The Best South Park Game"", but it's probably something South Park Studios would gladly slap on the box of this thing with all the underhandedness that that would entail, so we'll run with that. It's relevant that it's actually the best South Park game by a massive, orders-of-magnitude margin and actually manages to be a halfway decent game in its own right.The plot revolves around your character, the New Kid, moving into a vacant house in South Park with your mom and dad. Within short order you stumble across the kids from the show who are fully wrapped up in a 4th grade LARPing session revolving around the Stick of Truth. You're quickly enlisted to help in the conflict between the Humans, led by Cartman, versus the Jewish Elves led by Kyle.If you saw the ""Console Wars"" episodes of the show, they lead directly into this game in a way I don't think I've actually seen a licensed product do before. It's legitimately worth streaming them online prior to playing the game, as the game could really be considered just an extension of that plotline.It's also a fun contrast to see what happens when the writers of the show aren't bound by Comedy Central's standards and practices. South Park as a show is known for pushing the envelope pretty seriously. South Park the movie had something like 250 uses of the word ""♥♥♥♥"", was obscenely violent, had Satan in a gay relationship with a (then still alive) Saddam Husein, and featured a giant talking clitoris onscreen as a plot macguffin.The game puts the movie to absolute shame in terms of pure raunch.This is easily the most gleefully offensive South Park has ever gotten, and they have things in this game the MPAA would've balked at. Were this a film it would've quite easily landed an NC-17 rating. I don't even want to spoil any of it because it's been a really long time since I've been genuinely shocked by a game, and this game managed to pull it off several times over the course of its 15 hours or so. Just by way of a comparatively mild example: You get ""summmon"" items in the game in a nod to Final Fantasy's summon mechanic, but here it's assorted bit characters from the show. One of them is Mr. Slave, who pulls his pants down and lands♥♥♥♥♥first on your enemies before stuffing them inside of him while he moans with pleasure (in my case he performed this move against a 4th grade hall monitor, which means I've played a game where an adult stuffs a child up his♥♥♥♥♥as an attack. Try to imagine if they'd put that in a movie, even as a joke.)Get ready for a lot of cartoon nudity, basically.It's not all sex jokes, either. The plot starts as a bunch of 4th graders playing live action Dungeons and Dragons but things dramatically escalate from there and the stakes become much more real-world and cheerily violent and dark, even as the game (very amusingly) never loses sight of the fact that you're just some 12 year old kid playing pretend.This is used to attach a lot of legitimate RPG mechanics onto the game as well.You're given the ability to customize your character's appearance, though not their gender -- you're always male. To be fair the game does give a perfectly sensible plot reason for this and it's played up for humor later. You can find and equip new gear as well as ""Materia"" of a sort (here called ""Weapon Strap-Ons"" because of course) and as the game progresses you get a series of spells that can be used outside of combat for environmental challenges, like using your ""Dragonshout"" power (which is a fart, naturally) to ignite open flames and light anything behind them on fire to clear a path.Bosses include the denizens of a meth lab, red headed hall monitors, goth kids, 16 year old girls, drunk hobos, assorted wildlife, nazi zombie cattle, aborted fetuses, and in one memorable instance your father's swinging scrotum which you have to dodge using a quicktime event.Somehow it all actually holds together in the gameplay department. Part of this is due to the game being made by Obsidian who know their way around an RPG and have a good sense of how to interweave gameplay and narrative. The game's pacing is almost weirdly solid, even as it sticks to the fundamentals. There's a definitive first, second, and third act; sub quests are handed out at an even clip; you're given a narrative break after major plot events in the form of the day ending. It has the usual South Park problem where they never seem quite sure how to end the thing and it winds up getting so ridiculous that when it finally wraps everything up it kind of just...Stops, anticlimactically (which the game promptly lampshades and mocks, so).On the downside, the game is really easy, to the point where combat actually gets kind of boring because some of the crew's powers are so overbearingly good. You're allowed to use an item at every turn before attacking; there's an item (coffee) that allows you to attack twice. If you're willing to just stock up on coffee and pound it every round for the difficult-ish fights they become snore-inducingly easy even on Hardcore difficulty. If you want challenge out of this you sort of have to make it yourself, because you almost have to try if you want to lose.It also means that while there's a good amount of variety to the jokes, just because of the nature of turn-based RPG games you're going to start eventually hearing a lot of the same lines over and over again. Attack animations also cannot be skipped or disabled, which gets old quick as the really good ones come with comensurately lengthy animations attached to them.It's stuff that probably could've been ironed out if the game had a little more time in the oven, but if you've read about the very troubled history of the development of this game it's actually pretty wild that it turned out as good as it did, where I have to scrape a bit if I want to find things to complain about.Basically, it's short but it's reasonably mechanically solid, well voice acted, looks exactly like the show, and is honestly pretty funny and worth playing for the jaw-dropping level of objectionable content they managed to cram into basically every section of the game on what seems to have been a dare. Needless to say if you're easily offended or like to consider yourself above relentlessly juvenile humor because you worry deeply about what others will think about your values system instead of, say, reviewing the game in a public place so everyone will know you played and enjoyed it despite said objectionable content, then you should probably not bother with this game at all. If the idea of jokes about abortion, nazis, pedophiles, Canada, things that can be found inside Mr. Slave's colon (condoms, puppets, live bats, a working flashlight, an iPhone, etc.) and so forth doesn't sound like your cup of tea, your enjoyment of this game will probably be somewhat limited."

The creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone had a huge hand in helping make this game become a reality.  They of course do most of hte voice work, but also it seams they had a say in how the game characters should move and feel when you play.When you start this game you get treated to a great introduction that you will say to yourself...this is definately south park.  All the way down to when you create your character and move them around it will look like a south park cartoon.This game impressed me alot, by the care and work done on it.  The humor is outstanding well at least to those that like the south park genre and I am sure even non-fans and those who dont know what south park is will like this title.Among other things there is a bit of fan service at places....like being able to see inside for example cartman's closet and see all those things that where from differing eppisodes of the TV show.I like this game and i do recommend at least a try by anyone who has the money and time to play it.Combat like other RPG games is kind of turn based at times.....but the interesting part is that they give you ques to do things during this combat...instead of actual turns.The rest fo the game features puzzles and over area exploration.  Included inthe game is also the silly internal menu whihc they took the time to make it meaningful.  What i mean by this is....you use a cell phone to manage your equipment and friends and things....the funny part is...there is an in game social network where you can see differing things your friends say about each other or things that you do or dont do.All in all I would say this game would delight everyone who tries it.However I am not sure if anyone should let their children of too young an age play this one....due to the fact it does have violence and some harsh language."

Best served with no previous review consumption.Game mechanics are OK, although the end game is driven by story not the mechanics since you can easily become a bit overpowered and each battle can be won by the same moves over and over again, accordingly the beginning of the game is a bit slow paste and story begins to shine after maybe 6 hours (or less) of game play depending on how active you'll be with the exploring and side quests.Side quest count is really low and most of them can be completed and accessed early on in the game. There's little value for playing it few times and content will cover around 12 hours.When it comes to censored scenes by Ubisoft - realistically there was just two scenes where I though that it could't be shown on TV. If you think otherwise - watch south park few seasons back. Again, it's bit over-talked and over-hyped, it's not that bad and could go further in some cases.All in all - it's a fun trip for the south park fans and good standing grounds for future releases.

While the quality of the game is greater than any of my expectations for Obsidian, the notorious studio behind the butchery of several games, the volume of content is rather short.  You'll find that you have completed the main quest line in approximately 12 hours, and in addition, a vast majority of side content.  While ultimately, the game can be replayed as any of the classes for a different experience, the experience will ultimately be the same since the story is distinctly linear.  Fans of the series will be pleased with the quality of the end product, but ultimately disappointed in the lack of content brought together for a game that doesn't quite reinvent the wheel.Overall, my experience with South Park : Stick of Truth was fantastic.  The combat of the game is rugged and well polished, rewarding players for successfully completing various quick time events to deliver devastating damage.  The story of the game is hilarious and includes many head nods to nostalgic South Park episodes.

,Recommended,213670,9413235,"Posted: 10 March, 2014",all,LT Netjak,"This is the first full format review I've done since the site I used to write for died a slow death. Between the duties of getting older and a profession that relied on regular daily writing, putting up these kinds of reviews became more of a chore than fun. That said, it goes to show just how good this game is for me to say something more than a one liner on the quality of the end product I just experienced.After putting a playthrough of this game, I can easily say that The Stick of Truth is a masterpiece. Being a licensed title, I was hesitant to place any serious thought into it. Licensed titles, almost as a rule, are terrible. Sure, there is the rare quality title out there - Magical Quest Starring Mickey Mouse way back in the SNES days and the old Ninja Turtles arcade game come to mind - but those are strong crap shoots. But between the pedigree of the developer, Obsidian, and finally getting the kind of time and resources needed to develop their vision of a good game (I still imagine what KOTOR2 could have been if it wasn't rushed for a Christmas release), it was worth the chance.To sum it up here and now, I'll channel my inner Butters: boy howdy is this good.The Stick of Truth does what video games have promised since the Playstation 2 released - produced an animation quality game. While that may not say much given the source material, copying the elegent low-rent crappiness of South Park is no easy task. If I hadn't failed to move the mouse cursor off the side of the screen, the game is almost indistinguishable from a full episode of the series. The only time it ever turns into game territory is opening menus, the occational notification of Facebook messages from other characters and the battle UI. Otherwise, it's a complete, flawless recreation of the South Park look and feel.The feel goes well beyond the simple visual presentation. With the full contributions of Trey Parker and Matt Stone, the dialogue, story and voice acting also fit the bill to perfection. Sporting almost 100% original dialgue and fresh voice overs (one particular character aside which I won't spoil but you can figure out pretty easily), we get a complete South Park experience. The plot, starting with a simple play acting of a war between Elves and Humans, plays mostly in the imaginations of the kids, but seen as outside adult observers. Our main character, henceforth called ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ by Cartman no matter what you named him (I just named him that off the bat to save trouble), runs around the world in ridiculous cosplay weapons and armor and act out combat in a fantasy kingdom that suspiciously looks like the town of South Park. The story, as South Park is apt to do, quickly branches into multiple sub-plots with ever escalating insanity that no one but the main characters seem to recognize and all the various plot points seamlessly converging on each other in the climax. For a game built on fart jokes and crass humor, The Stick of Truth has suprisingly tight storytelling and an extremely advanced understanding of storytelling mechanics. This game could serve as an example of how to pace and deliver story content.A particularly strong element are the gaming jokes interspersed throughout. For instance, TSOT gets the right amount of mileage out of the silent protaganist and lampoons it. Nothing ever overstays its welcome in this game and jokes are given the right amount of airtime without becoming stale. You'll love the insanity of your trip to Canada.And that ending (or two if you found the other rather hilarious one right before the true one) is absolutely classic South Park.That said, there were some troubles with the story elements themselves, mostly from the perspective of a person who was old enough to be able to watch Episode 1 when it was still new and not have to sneak it to avoid my parents objecting to staying up too late. The Stick of Truth is effectively a giant South Park museum. Nearly everything in its 17 year run was called back at some point or another during the story. Most of it was begnign, such as looking through backgrounds in the photo studio, each of the four main kids' closets and some other background areas, but there was a little too much callback in the plot for my taste. While the bulk of the story is original, there are too many elements from prior episodes, particularly in the main plot. Some callbacks were handled well, such as the side-quest involving Mr. Kim of City Wok which closed the story of the Mongorians (yes, it is spelled intentionally this way), but for the most part, the game could have used fewer of them and left them more in the background. 17 seasons and 247 episodes is just a bit too much to shove into the game.The game itself plays relatively simply. You walk around the town, interact with the environment, mainly through farting on it and hitting it with whatever weapon you have handy, and enter battles. The battles are simple but I didn't find them monotonous as the interactivity of the moves kept me engaged. Combat is driven turn-base style reminiscent of classic JRPGs (with a lampshade hung squarely on this during the tutorial as to why it works this way) with the game giving you visual cues on when to press certain mouse or keyboard buttons to stick the perfect attack. While the skillset is relatively small - one melee, one ranged, four summons depending on your side quest progression and five abilities - the game throws enough variety in how each weapon operates and does enough interactivity to keep it fresh. Moving from warrior to thief changes the combat mechanics sufficiently to keep it interesting.A few negative point on the gameplay come from knowing what you're supposed to do. In-combat is mostly self-explanatory and the tutorial does a good job of showing you the basics, but the outside activities can be troublesome. The most confusing element until I figured out the proper pattern was the abortion sequence, though I suspect this was made intentionally difficult to show off the rather humorous results of failure. Also, the difficulty curve is inconsistent, with enemies coming at you well above your level or certain points where enemies have an almost full immunity to negative effects and insane hitpoints, but a final boss that wasn't all that tough to deal with.The game is sufficiently long, clocking in at a touch over 14 hours with side-quests compelted (not counting trying to find those elusive characters I haven't farted on or friended yet) and is quite satisfying without overstaying its welcome.I also had a bit of a musing about this game. I would find it quite entertaining if Parker and Stone were given a feed on the most common character appearance, class, name, final equipment and story decisions and integrated it as part of South Park canon in a future episode. I would be interested to see ""♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥"" make an appearance in the show and integrate the commonplace decisions into the show itself.Overall, I recommend South Park the Stick of Truth. It has the right balance of gameplay, storytelling and crass humor that I would expect out of a collaboration between Obsidian, Parker and Stone. The callbacks do get a touch overbearing, but if you're someone that hasn't consistently kept up with the show over a 17 year timespan, this shouldn't be too much of a bother. Otherwise, the flaws are relatively minor and the game shines practically everywhere else.Overall, 9.4/10."

The combat is also fairly fleshed out. There are status effects that can be inflicted on enemies. Also the unique ways each buddy can be used to suit your play style. You can even use the enviroment outside of combat using your abilities you get, such as your fart magic, and an anal alien probe. Skipping combat completely, but getting the experience.-Plenty to explore, and has some replayability. Although I never completed it after doing it twice.-It is creatively written. The story line is fantastic. Which it should be, being written by the developers of the show themself.-Due to the kids larping, it makes some creative items. You can literally take a crap in a toilet, and throw it at an enemy to gross them out.-The story line and all side missions can give you around... 20 hours, even more if you want to replay it.Negative:The negative aspects are just me nit picking a bit, but some of these can be an issue for others.-This game is for south park fans, and for people who are not easily offended. If you are not a south park fan? You might not enjoy this game, and not get most of the jokes.-The game is too easy on the default difficulty, and even on hard mode, it can be easy. I've found myself never losing a single battle when you follow the story line.-20 hours is a VERY short rpg game, when it ends, you just feel like you want more.Do I recommend this game? Yes and no... It is most assuredly a yes if you enjoy south park and LOVE inappropriate humor used in a clever fashion. No, if you are not a fan, and you are easily offended. This game is best for south park fans, and I thank the developers for making a brilliant game, when they could of easily screwed it up. I give it around 8/10. A good experience."

,Recommended,213670,13956786,"Posted: 12 January, 2015",all,|iG| Vertigo,"Stick of Truth's a surprisingly engrossing RPG, and a good entry point to the genre for South Park fans.It's clearly a console game, with limited options and no modding ability, fairly low difficulty level, and plays very well on a gamepad. And it's not particularly long for an RPG - you can get through the meat of it in around 16 hours without rushing.However, it's great fun. You can explore the entire town of South Park, sifting through shops and houses for items, and as you progress through the main story, you'll unlock new abilities that allow you to reach new areas of familiar locations. Levelling happens very frequently, via two separate systems - one skill tree is unlocked by amassing 'friends' on South Park's pseudo-Facebook (accomplished by completing quests or exploring), and the other is unlocked by gaining XP from combat.Combat happens very often, whether you're just wandering round the town or engaging in quests. It's turn-based, with you controlling an ally (such as Kenny or Butters) as well as your own character. There are several different damage types, which can multiply each other (for example, if you set an enemy on fire, then farting on them will cause much more damage). Weapons range from throwable tampons to ninja stars to Cartman's ""respect-mah-authoritah"" truncheon, and you can modify all of them to have additional properties.Player customisation is epic. There is a VAST range of outfits, ranging from SWAT uniforms to Crab People cosplay, all of which give you different perks, and can be customised with different colours and abilities. You can find glue-on facial hair, makeup, wigs, and get a nosejob at Tom's Rhinoplasty to look like David Hasslehoff. And though you can only select a boy (for story reasons), you can get a makeover to pull off a very convincing lady-boy.Graphics are... South Park. The whole thing's totally seemless, with your character appearing in cutscenes with full outfit customisation, and it does feel like a really long episode of the show. Particularly given that the voices are all accurate (most of them being performed by Trey Parker and Matt Stone anyway, who were intimately involved in the game's development).Writing's a little bit hit-and-miss. Though you can thoroughly explore the town, meet most of the show's characters and perform sidequests for them, most of these off-piste sections aren't particularly funny, and are more fan service than anything else.The focus of the writing is very clearly in the main story. It's funny, imaginative and shocking, and doesn't *require* you to have a knowledge of the show (though it helps). It doesn't have the rapid-fire succession of inspired random weirdness that made the show great originally, or the cutting satire that's kept it so successful in recent years, but it does have a gargantuan helping of the body humour (toiletry and sexing, basically) that's always been a South Park staple.Let's put it this way. If you like the idea of slapping Nazi zombie cows with large pink vibrators, or of harnessing the aromatic powers of your colon to subdue gun-toting SWAT agents, stop reading and hit the 'buy' button."

Filled with references and line-crossing South Park humour, you'll get your money out of it if you're a fan of the show. The gameplay is simple but well executed too, helping with the whole 'barrier of entry' issue that comes into turn-based RPGs (It's closer to Paper Mario than Final Fantasy).As far as the story goes, it's essentially one of those three-parters put together into an ongoing narrative, with your character being implemented surprisingly well as a central plot element. It's not mind-blowing and it comes just short of being great in the end, but the writing is very sharp by game standards.A word of warning though: While the censored content isn't anything special, the absence of it is incredibly jarring and breaks the flow of the narrative. It's also highly inconsistent. If losing chunks of exposition to censorship is intolerable, I'd sadly recommend you pass on this game, because it's particularly blatant here."

If you're a fan of the show and you like RPGs you will almost certainly enjoy this game. The humor is top-notch, balancing original humor and references to the show very well, and it plays excellently. On the other hand, it is very short. I can't imagine anyone getting more than fifteen hours out of a playthrough. I took about twelve hours and that included countless distractions. The game is also very easy, save for a few optional boss fights. There is a difficulty setting, though I didn't fiddle with it much. Considering it's an Obsidian game, it's also very polished. The only problem I ever ran into was the occasional flickering of the main character model in cutscenes.One note: it is admittedly a bit expensive, considering the length and amount of content. I probably wouldn't have gotten it myself if I hadn't had some Steam credit lying about uselessly. I would probably recommend waiting for a price drop for anyone but the most hardcore of South Park fans, who have probably already bought the game in the first place."

The animation is exactly the same and with the ability to wander around South Park you can interact with different residents, locations and your usual favourite characters feature heavily in each quest.The story is the usual crazy that Trey Parker and Matt Stone bring to the show - ranging from Aliens, Nazi Zombies and Taco Bell taking over the world and you will find yourself hilariously chuckling along the way.The main mission revolves around you, are the new kid. Enjoyably you create your character in the beginning, don’t spend too much time on this as you unlock plenty of weapons, outfits and features along the way which increase your level and add handy perks which are useful during battle. I was however disappointed that only male characters were accessible during the game, as I progressed throughout the game though I started to realise why this was the case, so don’t be too disheartened. Some girly features are unlocked along the way.As an RPG game this is certainly lacking and is sure will disappoint avid RPG fans. So if you’re into Final Fantasy, then this may not be the game for you. Each battle is a walk in the park and the longer I played, the longer I found myself becoming bored of each minor battle and tried avoiding as many as I could.The game tends to focus more on the fact that it’s South Park and the RPG aspects are not heavily focused on abilities or character strengths. In the beginning you can select your characters “class”. There isn’t any difference between them so seems like a bit of a pointless feature in the game.Each battle always features bizarre and shocking enemies, full of quick witted comments and the weapons and powers unlocked range from farting on enemies to hitting them with a plunger.I loved the buddy feature in which you have an additional character accompany you which makes the game more interesting as they possess different powers. I found that I mostly had Butters or Stan with me, so not sure how that differs from others game play but certainly doesn’t alter the game in any way.Finally, the game also features side missions which are worth playing as this allows you to unlock characters to summon during battles. It also just makes the game fore enjoyable."

The major bugs I ran into were a crash to desktop error during a cutscene that forced me to skip it and the occasional sprite flicker of my character during cutscenes. There are a myriad of other reported bugs in the game that I didn't run into but I imagine they are still a pain. In spite of this, I found the game incredibly fun and funny, though I imagine you do have to be a South Park fan to truly enjoy it. I was very skeptical about the game seeing as it was made by Obsidian who are notorious for extremely buggy games and considering that it's a turn based JRPG and I'm typically not into JRPG's. But the game stayed fresh, fun, fast, and hilarious throughout and that speaks very heavily towards the source material. If you're a South Park fan, you'll most likely love this game.

At the time it was an amazing show, that made fun of a little current issues and politics. Somewhere over the years it went from funny to overplayed jokes. When this game came out I was very hesitant as I assumed the same overused jokes were going to be repeated. However, it was on sale and a lot of my friends recommended it. Overall, I wasn't dissapointed and while there are some things I would possibly change to make it from good to amazing, it is well worth the money.You start off as the new ""mute"" kid to South Park and are promptly named Douchbag by Cartman. In a turn style action based game, you can choose from different classes of Mage, Warrier, Theif, and of course Jew. You get to dress your character up with different armor and attach bonuses. Special attributes are given, and overall it has decent gameplay. The overall story line is creative, and a huge bonus for me is the characters like Stanley, Kyle, and Cartman giving commentary to certain situations. You even get to give an abortion to a man and fight Nazis! A lot going on here.The two things I would probably change in this game that would have improved it greatly is implement crafting. Throughout the game you collect a lot of junk, and other than acheiving a gaming award for your collection, you can't do anything else with it other than sell it. I really wish some of the junk could be crafted to make some weapons or enchantments (patches in this game) to help improve combat.I would also add the ability to modify your party members. I would have loved several times to give my partner Butters an awesome Axe, or Cartman some better gear. The game says it updates the stats on the armor and weapons as you level up, but it doesn't quite feel the same as hand picking it yourself.Now, if they made a sequel or prequel to this game and added maybe some form of these compoenents I would buy it in a second. Really love the creativeness that has gone into this game, and hope that they make another one in the future. Would definetly recommend."

YOU'LL LOVE EVERY SECOND OF THIS GAME.You also wanna know why? Well, okay... dialogues are AWESOME, the story is practically a huge interactive episode of South Park, it's full of easter eggs, references and little details about all the things you loved most in the show. I really don't want to spoiler anything but trust me, it's great. Gameplay wise The Stick of Truth is a fairly simple JRPG, if I had to say something I didn't like is that the game is a little too easy, so you don't have time to use all the party members unless you farm certain enemies at a particular point of the game. But let's be honest, you don't play a South Park game for the RPG mechanics (which aren't bad by the way, the game is fun to play), you play it for the story and the dialogues, and those things are GREAT.A lot of achievements, collectibles, excellent player customization, good replayability, the whole package.

Replay value is definetely there, with each class (mage, warrior, thief, and jew) all having their unique abilities and playstyles. I do plan to playthrough one more time, as there is also room to miss some stuff (collectables and what not, appealing to perfectionists). The gameplay itself manages to not become too repititive, with new enemies and buddies (companions) constantly being introduced. Finally, if you enjoy the humor that the show contains, then this game is pretty much just that. Long time fans will love all the referances to past episodes there are, but theres still plenty of new material for anyone somewhat new to South Park."

Everything from your equipment to your abilities and enemies are truly fantastically designed to fit right into the South Park universe, and there are a lot of hilarious enemies and boss battles that all seem to keep the game different as you continue to play through it. While I haven't beaten the game just yet, I have heard it is a bit on the short side, but with the great mix of fun gameplay, hilarious comedy, amazing story-telling by Matt and Trey(as usual), I think it's well worth the price tag. Plus the town of South Park is chock full of fun places to explore with even the ""junk"" items you find lying around being little easter eggs for both longtime and newer fans of the show.

,Recommended,213670,15194484,"Posted: 3 April, 2015",all,PΟSΞφDοΠ,"It’s really quite remarkable how South Park creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone have slowly ramped up the shock value over the past 17 years to keep the show sharp. Whether they and developer Obsidian could pull off the same for a 14-hour game instead of a 22-minute show was never a sure thing. But there I was, shrunk down to Underpants Gnome-size, crawling up Mr. Slave’s orifices to retrieve a WMD, slicing through gobs of bodily fluids in turn-based JRPG combat and climbing up half-digested corn-on-the-cob as I went, laughing hysterically the whole way. I’m floored at how consistently funny it is, and at how well the outrageous comedy melds with the relatively simple gameplay to create not just an amazing South Park game, but an intelligent and witty satire of roleplaying mechanics.As for the story, it’s a clever premise that allows The Stick of Truth to take place in a recognizable and painstakingly recreated South Park setting, but also brings in all the usual fantasy roleplaying tropes through the power of children’s imagination. It’s a trick used many times in the show, and it works great for the game, too. An epic LARPing session (as casually set up by last year’s “Black Friday” trilogy of episodes) has your custom-created new kid in town joining either Cartman’s Humans or Kyle’s Elves, all dressed in amusingly bad makeshift cosplay outfits. True to the show, things escalate wildly and hilariously, leading to conspiracies involving the government, aliens, and Taco Bell.Though it manifests itself in typically over-the-top South Park-ian ways, The Stick of Truth is a Paper Mario-esque RPG-lite. You and your single extra party member (you’ll unlock several South Park regulars, though only one can fight with you at a time) take turns battling formations of enemies, be it the Gingers, crazy homeless guys, aliens, and more. Typical buffs and debuffs are ably skinned in screwed-up fourth grader verbiage (throwing feces to add “gross out” effects) mixed with mana-powered spells and timed button-press attacks and blocks to keep you on your toes during combat. It keeps things simple enough while still leaving room for some tactical depth. And Obsidian refreshingly leaves out time-sink annoyances like character encumbrance and random battles you can’t avoid.I couldn’t resist the curious lure of playing as the Jew class over the archetypal Fighter, Thief, and Mage options, but the differences between them turned out to beSouth Park: The Stick of TruthMarch 4, 2014Stan, Kenny, Kyle and Cartman set out to kick role-play gaming in the nuts with South Park: The Stick of Truth, an RPG set in the town of South Park.→  Much MoreRyan McCaffrey SaysTry This Game If You Liked:South Park: Bigger, Longer and UncutSouth Park Let's Go Tower Defense Play!Paper Mariodisappointingly slight. Sure, each has their own special abilities, but there are effectively no class-specific weapons or items, and there’s nothing to stop a Mage from choosing melee-enhancing gear and carving up foes with a blade just as well as a Fighter. All classes eventually learn special farting magic (a crude parody of Skyrim’s Dragon Shouts) though both the thumbstick motions and especially the tutorial sessions for your powers of flatulence tend to be cumbersome. Achievement or Trophy hunting aside, this lack of class differentiation or significant choices in the story are big reasons why I don’t feel much incentive to replay the campaign.The other unfortunate offense is that some extremely useful things are poorly explained, if they’re even mentioned at all. Tricks like being able to switch your Buddy at any time by pressing down on the D-pad to access the Party menu, or taking the first swing at overworld enemies so that you get the first turn when the battle starts, and what your Buddies can do and are specifically good at are all up to us to discover accidentally. One other puzzling issue is the slipperiness of the action-selection wheel during combat – it’s strangely difficult to get your pointer to stick on the option you want, particularly if it’s in a diagonal slot on the wheel.But that’s about the extent of the damage. Aesthetically, The Stick of Truth might be the most beautiful crappy-looking-on-purpose game I’ve ever seen. While it may seem trivial to make a role-playing game resemble the crude, construction-paper cutout style of the show, it’s executed so well here that the two mediums are almost indistinguishable. You’ll never see a HUD when walking around town, for instance, unless you tap the Y/Triangle button. Only the very rare stuck animation on an overworld enemy and (on both consoles, but not a capable PC) the occasional frame rate stutter when a new area loaded in for the first time reminded me that this was a game and not the show. And that was the extent of the technical problems I encountered.The VerdictThe Stick of Truth makes one thing abundantly clear: I never want to play another South Park video game made without Trey Parker and Matt Stone's direct,"

Not only is this licensed game functioning and playable, it's actually good. No, it's more than good. It's brilliant. The gameplay and world fits the South Park license so well and as a long time fan of the series, I've nothing but praise for this game.When I first heard about Stick of Truth, I wasn't too excited. Licensed Games weren't exactly high art and I wasn't a fan of the Lord of the Rings setting because the only South Park episode with that setting I really liked was Return of the Fellowship of The Ring. But when more information came out about it, it slowly began to win me over. This wasn't this setting. It was a parody. It was still the characters and universe that we knew and loved, but using the LoTR settings as a tounge and cheek joke and it honestly worked in my eyes.The gameplay really does fit the South Park setting with it being totally in 2D and it also helps brings fun to the turn based fighting in the game. In most RPGs you just hit your attack, and then wait to dodge your enemies attack. In Stick of Truth, they've added a mechanic where you need to time your attack to get maximum damage out of it as well as other variables, such as archers, multiple hit enemies, shields, and more. It really works to help keep the game out of repetive areas in my opinion.The graphical style is of course the same that's been featured in the show. Normally, you'd be thinking ""lol how could a 2013 game have these graphics"". But considering the art style and joke about the South Park style, I find the graphics very charming, and helping add to the feel of the SP universe.On top of that the game is absolutely filled to the brim with nothing but in-jokes, references, and more to the most popular and even the least popular episodes of the series. Little things like finding the Gamesphere from Towelie's episode, or finding Butters' The Poop That Took a Pee book, or even finding a certain character inside Stan's closet who refuses to come out. This game is a love letter to South Park fans everywhere, and if you are a South Park fan, this game is an absolute must buy. There is so much love put into this game to make it a game that caters to the South Park fans.As for non-fans, I would suggest maybe watching a few episodes of the series before deciding to jump onto the game because the humor is very much like South Park's actual series, so unless you think you'll really love the gameplay element, I think you should see if the show's humor interests you beforehand before you decide to get this game. But in my own opinion, South Park The Stick of Truth is a excellent game, and shows that when developers put actual effort in, they can make a truly special game for TV Shows."

South Park: The Stick of Truth is one of those rare occasions. A great role-playing game made by Obsidian Entertainment (creators of Fallout: New Vegas) along with the creators of South Park (who also do a lot of the voice acting) to create a funny and simple game in which to celebrate the world of South Park and also to give fans something to enjoy for years to come. While relatively short by most role-playing game standards, lasting between 15-18 hours, The Stick of Truth gives enough variety and plenty of humor to make it an easily enjoyable experience and worth the asking price. Everything in the game is wholly belonging to South Park, it has songs from episodes dotted throughout the game, voice actors make a return to voice their respective characters and everything feels like South Park. Visuals also feel directly translated from the show, the game feels like a very long episode of the show. Controls are simple and easy to learn, the game overall is pretty easy with only a few enemies posing a decent challenge so you won’t feel very much pressure from the combat portion of the game. The only real detriment to South Park: The Stick of Truth is the fact that it is everything South Park. While I personally find the game to be funny and enjoy the jokes, it is easy to see how this game can turn away those who aren’t huge fans or hate the humor that South Park has and there isn’t an amazing enough role-playing game here to win those on the fence about South Park over. The other minor gripe with the game is the controls when using the mouse and keyboards. Some of the abilities didn’t feel like they responded as well when using their respective keys versus a controller. I also experience a few glitches such as Jimmy not getting out of his stuttering loop and some minor glitches of my character flickering in and out of a scene during a cinematic.Overall I enjoyed my time with South Park: The Stick of Truth, there is a fun role-playing game here along with the great humor of South Park. Those who won’t enjoy this game are those who are going to be offended by what is displayed in the game or just don’t enjoy the humor of South Park. If you are middle of the ground and don’t mind the humor the role-playing game beneath may not be enough to warrant a full $60.00 USD price tag.-Thumbs Up from RoyialVideo Review:www.youtube.com/user/RoyialNetwork"

A single play through took about 18 hours.Being able to enjoy southpark is a lynchpin to recommending this game and if you do you'll have a great time. I haven't actually watched the show in many years but I felt like I was playing an episode and had a blast.The gameplay itself is fairly easy even on the hardest difficulty and calls back to the likes of paper mario. The game is rife with those little touches that can make you smile, almost every character sporting unique attacks and animations relevent to who they are in the quiet mountain town. I enjoyed it enough to start another play through with a different one of the 4 available classes, however at it's core it doesn't have much replayability.It's abolustely wonderful to know this game exists and is good, it's an example that we can indeed have nice things."

Both of these kinds of players can expect a very solid product on both fronts.The writing and art style is very faithful to the IP because Matt and Trey were given complete control over the game from the very beginning. The combat system reminds me a lot of the two first Paper Mario games where you have complete control over the overworld in which you can loot, interact with the townsfolk and buy and sell inventory. When you come across an encounter you're taken to a stage to combat the enemy party. There you use abilities that require PP, normal or magic attacks, and the buddy in your party has their own attacks, abilities magic and so on. No option to run away though, the kids must not like being♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥even though that would be helpful.All in all, I would happily recommend this game who is a fan of South Park's unique brand of humour.

I collected everything I could find and did tons of side quests for friends and just to extend the game.

I am glad to say that it doesn't require that god awful Uplay.The game itself is what you would expect of South Park. The game feels as though you are seeing/playing an actual episode of the titular show. Your favorite characters are here including Cartman, Butters, Tweek, Jimmy, Craig, Kenny and more. You start by creating your very own character who is a bit of a blank slate. In true South Park fashion Cartman starts the mud slinging as soon as you give your character a name. Its from this moment that you nod your head knowingly that this is indeed South Park.You are on a quest to protect the stick of truth and keep it from the hands of the elves. Along the way you will meet meth addicts, aliens and more. Its hard to write a review without spoiling some of the great moments in the game that will put a smile on your face.Beneath its crass, crude and faithful exterior is a surprising amount of depth in the gameplay itself. You have magic, ranged and melee attacks and find various bits of gear to equip. You have abilities that use PP while others like your fart attacks use mana. The game makes clever use of allowing you to time a counter and block incoming damage. One of my favorite abilities is kicking enemies in the nuts to stun them. Completing sidequests can also net you some powerful summons that you can use as well.In the end Stick of Truth is not only one of the more faithful licensed games I have played. But it may just be one of the best licensed games I have played. If you are a fan of South Park you are sure to enjoy this adventure. Pick it up on sale now or preorder the sequel and get this one for free."

It's like a much better version of Costume Quest so if you liked that then you'll love this.My only complaint is going with the blank slate silent protagonist, which is so cliche by this point that even as a parody it's tired. You only control this one character with one ""buddy"" party member at a time, and the buddy you start out with (Butters) is better than all the others so you'll never use anyone else. While I enjoyed the game, I never really laughed because there's only so much comedic possibilities with a silent protagonist.

Being a fan of RPGs or not will have zero effect on your enjoyment if you enjoy the show.There are some negatives though, most having to do with it being a bad console port;-Price. I got it 66% off and that's pushing it when it comes to gameplay value. But well worth the entertainment value of the story and comedy.-Loading screens between nearly every single area or transition.-The controls are pointlessly clunky in parts; You will go through a tutorial learning a move one way only to find out it is completely different in combat and then different yet again in the World Map.-It was admittedly very easy but I did grind and explore quite a bit.-Menu system for equipment modification ""patches"" is clunky.-I had an audio clip drop during one part but had subtitles on luckily. Only happened once.Things that didn't bother me but might bother others;-30FPS cap.-Shop menus are slow when it comes to selling junk.-Some cutscenes are a pixel off to the right and down.Basically it really is a horrible port to the PC.BUT!The good far outweighes the bad if you're a fan of the show. Endless references. Nearly every character makes a cameo. Well written. Very very often laugh out loud funny. And the gameplay itself is way deeper than I could have ever imagined.

I grinded and explored the town multiple times over the course of the game just for the pure enjoyment of the easter eggs.Any South Park fan has to play this. Pick it up if it is 66% or more on sale.

South Park as a show is uneven, with every other episode being either a hit or miss. As it turns out The Stick of Truth is South Park at its best, with only very little of the bad.Central to the game is the premise. This is about children playing a fantasy RPG in their town. Everything that happens is interpreted through their eyes as part of the game and the lore they’ve made up. This creates brilliant scenes where the real world pokes through and reminds you it’s all just make believe, and everyone in the game knows it’s pretend, but they’re 100% committed to the game. Even when real♥♥♥♥♥♥goes down the kids never break character and just incorporate what’s happening into their game. Not at any point do they stop “playing”, and this clearly confuses many of the adults who can’t always tell if they’re playing or not.The game itself is an old school jrpg style game with tweaks here and there to make it feel somewhat modern. You explore the town and talk to NPCs, fight in turn based combat and use tools that you discover over the course of the game to access new areas Metroid style. Cutscenes are generally brief, and it doesn’t feel like you’re watching an episode of the show, even though it looks exactly like it. You definitely “play” this game. If you’re expecting something like The Walking Dead where you can pretty much take your hands off the controls for minutes at a time, this isn’t it. I found all the mechanics to be fun to play around with, and the difficulty of combat to be balanced the way I like it. Almost every review I’ve seen complains that the balance is tilted too easy, but I don’t agree. I never died, but it was close a couple times. I didn’t feel like I could breeze through every fight without using items and abilities.The world isn’t particularly big, but it makes up for it by being dense in detail. Given that you spend the majority of the time exploring the world by yourself it’s good that they gave it the time and care it needed. Going through every nook and cranny, discovering characters, quests and nods to past episodes of the show feels rewarding. At no point did I feel like the game was wasting my time or padding for length, even during the more mundane fetch quests. There’d always be something on the other end which would make it feel worth it. The length of the game felt just right.I had more fun playing this than I was expecting. The way it manages to poke fun at games and stories feels fresh, and makes this more than merely a good license game. It’s an excellent game. Definitely worth playing, unless you can’t stand South Park obviously."

I can say straight away, if you don't like the series, then don't get this game, and stop reading.I was a little worried about what to expect with this game when I saw the first gameplay videos. A mix of adventure and turnbased combat is a very rare thing to see these days, atleast among the ""larger"" titles. As soon as the game or rather episode started, my worries disappeared. This is not so much a game,as it is another episode in South Park.You take on the role as the new kid in town, and as you get forced to make friends in the neighbourhood, all sorts of crazy adventures and humorous catastrophes happen. The story is very good and the progression in this, has never been to slow or to fast. I find that in some games the story gets lost in to much gameplay or the gameplay gets ruined by the story. This game seems to keep the balance between gameplay and story very nicely, which I find is very important to a game with so much comedy. This leads me to the main reason to get the game. The amount of profanity, insanity and sexuality mixed in with a nice amount of violence left me laughing out loud more times I can remember. If you like South Park humour the game is certainly required in your game collection.The gameplay is nothing elaborate or even diffecult. You wander around on maps, interacting with items, people or enemies, and move between these maps without any load time. When you encounter an enemy, the game switches to a turnbased combat phase. The combat is fairly straightforward and for each attack there is a combination of mouseclicking and button-mashing to get it to work. Even if you fail in this sorta easy mash-click-buttoning (Which I did plenty of times), you will still damage your enemy, albeit for a smaller amount of damage. The combat sorta has a tactical element with selecting the right attack for the correct enemy and at the same time requiring a bit of skill with that click-button-mashing. The same applies to the enemy attacks, which you can defend yourself from.The graphics and sound are the same as in the series, though there was a part in the game that changed considerably. I wont spoil anything in this review, but I can tell that I liked the retro-feel of it, and in combination with the story it was a little detail that left me smiling and laughing.The game in itself would be 5 out of 5 stars from me. This however leaving out the price of the game and also the replay value. There are some small elements of choice in the game, but none that will make the story change to much. There are some choices with your class, and some choices during the game, none of which really makes that much of an impact on the story, which is my main reason to get the game. I spent 22 hours playing the game and with a price of 40 euros, that is a big price to pay for a game with nearly no replay value. Still, I look at this game as a gem, and 22 hours laughing and smiling, well... I pay around 10 euros to go to the movies, and those only last what? Like 2 hours?"

Now don't let Ubisoft's name put you off because even though South Park is an Ubisoft game you don't need Uplay to play it. The game is about 10 hours in length even with side quests and most of the time you'll be completing the 10 or twelve story missions the game has to offer. The game is locked to 30 frames per second although due to the aesthetic it actually works in this specific case. The game as a whole is very well put together but since most of South Park is dependent on very subjective themes like humor, reception will vary wildy from person to person.http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=711296968South Park takes place in, you guessed it, the small town of South Park and you play as a nameless and voiceless new kid on the block. You soon meet with Cartman and Butters and discover the fantasy world that these kids have set up, joining them in the process. This game that the kids play revolves around a ""magical"" item called the stick of truth and whoever controls said stick can then control the universe. Over the course of the game you run all across South Park gathering support for the humans so that you can assault the elves and take back the stick. Most of the story is just lots of general outlines of what could have been a funny story but instead was stuffed with toilet humor and fan service. A large amount of the lines end up being incredibly cringe-worthy, such as the overarching theme that you should never fart on someone's balls or some of the lines the girls have. The entire story ends up being mostly running around South Park and trying to recruit the various factions to play with you (I.E. The Goths and the girls). None of the characters are anything close to interesting and for a game that calls itself an RPG they really don't explain much about the characters and instead seem to rely on you having watched the show. As most of the characters are dull and repetitive, so too are the environments and in South Park you'll be running back and forth throughout the same environments over and over again for some tedious quest or another and in the end this is just too mind-numbingly boring.http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=711294458The gameplay, however, is actually pretty well done as far as most RPG's go. You have multiple different methods of attacks: Ranged, melee, magic and abilities along with a plethora of consumables for mid-battle use. You acquire many different kinds of weapons and armor over the course of the story and each piece has its own bonuses that come with it. Most of the armor bonuses are just passive bonuses and thus are pretty boring but there really wasn't much else they could've done with this so I can let it slide. The armor types and models are suprisingly varied and you can get some pretty cool looking sets that really feel like something you would see kids create. You can customize your armor to a degree with various slottable upgrades and different colored dyes but for the most part the main bits of the armor cannot be changed. If you have half a mind and explore even the slightest bit then South Park will prove to be incredibly easy and, as far as RPG's go, incredibly short, as the game should clock in at about 10 hours and that's counting about two hours of exploring that I did early on. South Park has a real problem with difficulty and for pretty much the entire game, with the exception of a fight or two, it's incredibly easy. South Park has a very limited setting to work with and as such seeing the same old parts of the town can really hit you with a feeling of tedium that an RPG cannot have. Most of the side quests are pretty boring too and really end up being either fetch quests or quests you can't finish until later so you forget about them. Since The Stick of Truth is an RPG you can upgrade your character with various perks ability upgrades. Ability upgrades follow a linear upgrade line while perks can be unlocked in any order but also tend to have a more minor impact on gameplay. You unlock perks by getting more friends which you unlock by simply talking to people or doing their quests and it does give the town of South Park a very connected feel as if everybody knows everybody. There's also the buddy system where you can take one buddy along with you to fight in combat and help you out with environmental roadblocks. The buddies are simply a letdown because you end up unlocking the final one not halfway into the game and you are never given any reason to switch off of the first buddy given to you.TL;DRAn RPG with solid gameplay that's severely hampered by places of cringe-worthy dialogue and overuse of toilet humor. Only for fans of the series.If you found this review helpful or entertaining then feel free to leave a comment and join my Steam Curator Group atMudkips Gaming"

If you've never seen South Park but you have a cracking sence of humor and don't mind any topic being on the table for a joke, you will enjoy this game. I can't wait to play the sequel - The Fractured But Whole!(I played in normal mode and it was a tad easy, so I would recommend playing it on difficult from the beginning - you can change the setting at any time if you change your mind)"
,Recommended,213670,16777356,"Posted: 29 June, 2015",all,Michael@Belgium,"I almost never play(ed) RPG games but this game is an exception for sure. You basicly play a whole South Park story with your choices. At the start you make your own south park character which is quite nice, although you can easily change everything later in the game too, while playing.If you like RPG and/or South Park itself, then I recommend you to try this out for sure. The humor is obviously there just like in the series and references too. The game is quite detailed, you can explore the whole map, loot a lot of stuff, there are main and side-quests, abilities, collectables, skills, upgrades ... and a lot more stuff. The game is turn-based and you can notice that in battles, every side gets its turn untill you knock out/kill the other team. You can easily get some potions in loot to increase your attack and stuff or refill some health. A good hint before confronting enemies and get into a battle is that there are puzzles in the game, which abilities are meant to use for. You can knock someone out before getting into battle, but you can loose health too before getting into the battle ! For the rest I'll say there are way more features I did not mentioned, so get this great game.About negative sides, I don't see any major ones... The people who say it doesn't have any replay potentional, well I already can say I wanna see what happens when I pick other choices. If you're a curious person, you will check that out and replay it. An example is that you have to choose a side where you fight for (Elves or humans). Maybe another point is the main price (30 €) - I rather feel like that 5-10 € too much.So again, if you get the game you'll like it. But get it when there's discount.

Categories are gameplay, game mechanics, graphics, aesthetics, plotline, and price. Rating is 9/10. It's worth the $59.99, especially when you consider the crappy EA Battlefield, terrible EA Sports games, and awful Activision Call of Duty (which are released at full price when in reality they are worth like $15 at most with no sale at release). If you're not familiar with South Park, go toSouthParkStudios.comand watch a few recent recent episodes for free (and legally). Then come back and play the game. All in all, get this game.If you like South Park, then you will like this game. In case you haven't heard, this game gets offensive and totally inappropriate in all the best ways. Definitely NOT for children, because it's inappropriate for them, and they wouldn't even get why most of this insanity is actually funny. A good overall concept to approach this game with is that you are a character on the show during one of the episodes.I rate this game 8/10. 5 star rating is for games like Dead Island, Killing Floor, Strike Suit Zero, and Warhammer 40,000 Space Marine. 10 star is for Stanley Parable, Terraria, Saints Row IV, Batman Arkham City. And the 11/10 is reserved for the likes of Kerbal Space Program, Starbound, and Fallout: New Vegas.The game play is basically a bit of exploration, quests, and battles. The exploration aspect is average, does get a bit tiresome to have to find a fast travel point. Personally, as a fan of the show, it was interesting to walk around the town and really get a feel for the layout. The hidden items do require some thinking and memory, which is refreshing break from the usual ""Oh great I found that collectible right in front of that huge blinking arrow."" The quests are engaging; both the main quests and side quests. This relates to the story of the game, which is discussed below.The game mechanics for battle are simple yet solid, and is the main drawback of the game. That is to say, the gameplay is great but not awesome. It's basically a slightly evolved version of what Final Fantasy on the NES and SNES used, basically with the addition of timing your attacks and blocks for extra damage. This is the mechanic used battle after battle, and can get a little stale if you don't acquire new gear, or if you are hung up on a particular battle. Played on Normal, the battles are challenging enough, which helps the battles from feeling repetitve. The addition of new moves and different buddies also helps.The graphics are great. Everything is clear, and there is minimal compression noise. I, personally, would have preferred an entirely uncompressed game (or perhaps a DLC option like Skyrim offered), but I realize that not everyone wants to spend a good amount (aka, too much) money on their computer, so no fault here.The aesthetics are standard South Park, which means they are amazing. The movements are both crappy and intricate. Color choices are from a limited palate, yet are are used deftly. Broad-stroked, yet detailed. Watch a newer episode, and you'll perfectly understand the well-executed aesthetics of this game. I actually would say that this game has more overall visual things happening than any 1 episode.The plotline and storytelling of this game is where Stick of Truth really shines through. The voice acting is brilliant, as per usual South Park. As for the writing (as in, if you were going to sit down and read a transcription) is great. For fans of the show, the writing is more Black Friday S17E7 and less Margaritaville S13E3. But that's not why we're here. The insanity is way, WAY off the charts... and that indeed is what we want. I will not divulge any of that here, because you really should just experience it by playing the game. Actually, reviewing this game without mentioning all the spoilers and insanity IS a bit tricky, because as you can imagine it's a pretty large part of this game. And what a great part it is.A good way to approach this game is as a new character on the show. That is to say, if you are looking for a super serious RPG and can't take a joke, this would not be the game for you. If you're looking for a good time, this is your stop.Is it worth $59.99 (which is the release price)? Hard to say, really. I think in order to answer this question, you have to consider this game as multifaceted: as an object internally to the company that made it (so you don't support a terrible company like EA), you have to consider the game itself (is it just fanservice, or is it actually a decent game), the game as it compares to other games, and for a game based on a TV show, is it enjoyable to only fans or to everyone?No way is it worth $59.99: ""South Park Studios has enough freaking money. What they did in the past is great, but that was then and this is now. The company doesn't actually matter, all that matters is what I'm getting for my money right now."" <-- I personally don't gree with this mentality, so I couldn't really extrapolate on it. However, it wouldn't be fair to leave it out. I would say that you have to vote with yout votes and your money. Don't support ♥♥♥♥♥♥ companies and their ♥♥♥♥♥♥ products. We deserve better, not just whatever turd they want to feed us.Yes, it's worth $59.99 (which is my opinion): South Park Studios is a generally great company. They really do make fun of anyone, and do it to such a degree that it supports our freedom of speech. They have come far on the sweat of their own brow. So then, no qualms with the company. As it is, it's a really well executed ""give the player an interactive experience of an episode,"" and the best one I've come across, ever. The battle mechanics are easy to approach, and the story, humor, and acting is top notch.Finally, consider all the other games that are priced at $59.99: EA sport games (e.g. Fifa and Madden) and Activision's Call of Duty series, are essentially re-skins of the same game. I'm not going to get into it now, but these games are worth about $15 at release date as they are essentially weapon and map packs. Also consider that Oblivion, Skyrim, New Vegas, Starcraft, Dota, Rust, Dayz, and more are released for less than $60. What I'm getting at is: it takes a game of rare form to really warrant a full price release at $60. EA and Activision games are NO WHERE NEAR THAT MARK. Aka, PLEASE STOP BUYING THESE CRAPPY GAMES AT FULL PRICE. End rant.South Park, I believe, hits that mark. Not one thing in this entire game can be labeled ""bad"" or ""needs work."" Considering this, I hope this game is a proof of concept, as I would absolutely love to see more interactive episodes like this. If you ever buy a game for $59.99, this might be it.Finally, if you are not familiar with the show, you should go to SouthParkStudios and watch a few of the recent ones. It's totally free, and totally legal. Personally, as a fan of the show, I would recommend you start from S1E1 and go all the way forward if you've never seen the show. Firstly to get all the jokes in the game, and secondly because you can really see the development of the techniques, characters, writing, and equipment they use. Seeing the show as well as the studio through the episodes is worth the watch.Sooooo yeah. Review done. Get this game."

A lot of references, and definitely the humor most people recognize the series as being known for.Pros:- Customization (character, appearance, stats, abilities)- Interactivity (Really does feel like an RPG game, in both fights and exploration of the overworld.)- The same stupid (but laughable) comedy this series has been known for.Cons:- Known bugs that can interrupt your playthrough (Experienced one such bug when learning my first Magic spell. I had to reload a checkpoint about 1 minute before the tutorial).- Instructions can sometimes be unclear of where to go next, or interactable items can be difficult to notice (This may not apply to all people. I was stuck twice for about 10 minutes each unsure of what to do next.).- Even for the humor and gameplay (Let's be serious, this was not a game for a high graphics expectation), compared to other games available now at similar or lower prices, I say it is not worth the FULL $60. It's worth a good chunk of that in my opinion (Like $30-$40), but not the full $60.Overall: Worth getting if you see it on sale. It's a good time filler when I want to play a game on my own, that a 3-year old laptop can still run at perfect frames."

This game is fanservice at its best. As an unabashed South Park fan, this game had me literally laughing out loud for most of the game. If you are a South Park fan, do not hesitate to buy The Stick of Truth! If you're not, I'm afraid that the RPG-style gameplay may be a bit dull and a bit too easy to keep you interested. You'll find yourself spamming the same couple of attacks in every battle. The timed button presses make it a bit more engaging, but once you're doing them by muscle memory... battle kinda becomes a chore.There are a fair amount of collectable elements that make exploring all the nooks and crannies of the seemingly shrunken town of South Park more interesting, at least on the first playthough. Absolutely no grinding, very few fetch quests, and the game doesn't draw anything out unneccisarily, making it short but sweet. It's sort of like an RPG for people who don't play RPG's, but honestly the gameplay is just there to add a 'game' element to what is otherwise a long episode of South Park.Be wary of the autosave system! Reloading a game may mean you have to go back and re-do something because it doesn't save your exact moment of progress! Pay attention each time you load your game, as there are some missable collectables! I missed out on a major achievement because of this wonky system. TALK TO CLYDE AS SOON AS YOU ENTER KUPA KEEP! You'll thank me later!89/100Funny and fun, South Park fans should definitely play this! This RPG-stlye game is simple, but doesn't drag you through hours of pointless distractions."

As a avid fan of South Park, this game is purely 100% genuine from the show (from the original developers), definitely much better than the other South Park games since the show's debut. The gameplay is from what you're expected from a normal rpg game, although its quite similiar to Mario and Luigi Superstar Saga (as well as Dream Team and Bowser's Inside Story). Although, it has puzzle elements too, which I didn't expect but it was really fun. Otherwise, I would highly reccomend this to fans of RPG and South Park alike. Bravo, Matt Stone and Trey Parker.

76561198009634716,Recommended,213670,9442203,"Posted: 12 March, 2014",all,-Badgerkun-,"TL,DR: A South Park fans must own. Everyone else, give it a play, most fun you'll probably have had since Blood Dragon.I've never, ever been a big proponent of DLC - let it be items like clothing, weapons or skins - but this is the first game that's left me wanting more to play with other than rerolling a new class after the final boss battle. A game that actually makes you want to buy the next adventure/side-mission pack for the game is faaaaaar to rare to come by these days. Yet in honesty, the sticker price for the game isn't worth the 60$ but I still found myself fulfilled with a great, fun time that made me feel like I was playing a South Park game set in South Park, unlike pretty much every South Park up until the release of SoT.The mechanic of mix-and-match flair with costumes is a great alternative to the often rigid armor and equipment set-ups for modern rpg/arpg's and the straight forward ""Yes, x item is better then y item"" interface that many modern RPG's have taken up is present and in place and keeps you playing the game then weighing stats.On the Kenny side of the tracks; the classes feel a bit on the 'samey' side, with little to differentiate them aside from their class names and spell animation flair. I played a Thief and rerolled to a mage after the final boss battle and found that he pretty much had the exact same starting abilities as my Thief: A stun and a dot - although their advancements do seperate them marginally, I think greater attention to how the classes could have been different really should be priority if there will be any additional content or sequels to the game.Old Mister Hat's to the RPG/ARPG genre should probably play it on the hardest difficulty if you're looking for a challange, otherwise the myriad of stuns you're afforded will make much of the game a cake walk. Upon retreving your first ranged weapon, you're able to stun a member of the enemies you'll be facing on the battle screen by shooting them from the overworld and hitting one of their buddies. They're stunned for a round or two, which buys you a lot of time to work with, in addition to the way speed is handled, you'll find it incredibly hard to die on the lowest difficulty.Which kinda brings me to my one major point: The game doesn't focus so much on being an RPG set in South Park but more as a South Park episode you get to be part of with it's 'magic', stylized turn-based combat and Matt Stone and Trey Parker humor that'll probably keep me coming back for more."

The graphics are classic South Park style. The whole town of South Park you know and love from the show is explorable, including good ol' Canada. Now to the negatives: For one, this game is very short for the price tag $59.99, and to my experience has very little replayability considering there's only one choice for each quest/situation. There is some in poor taste jokes thrown in, but considering it's South Park, it's nothing new. Another peeve I have is that there's no difficulty option, so depending how thorough you are, the game will become extremely easy in the mid-late stages of the game. Overall, I would recommend this game as a definite buy for South Park fans. However, to traditional RPG lovers, this game is not for you for the obvious reasons stated above. Overall great game.

Even more brutal, rude and offensive than the series - which for South Park is only a good thing.Controls are simple and obvious, RPG battles are built to perfection.The game is widely customisable with many different functional and cosmetic aesthetic items to gather, combined with custom dye colour and effect modifiers vastly increasing the options available, as well as the huge range of weapons and the effect modifiers that can be applied there also.Can sometimes be a little shallow with the voice lines for side characters, who only have a few lines of dialogue, though this is a very mior issue and to be expected of any game.- looking at you, Miss.

,Recommended,213670,9447264,"Posted: 13 March, 2014",all,Battledore,"Disgusting, offensive, hilarious. South Park in three words. You play as ""some kind of dragonborn"", but unlike Skyrim (which is 500+ hours), this game is not very lengthy for an rpg. The main quest was finished in under 13 hours, and that time includes me  ♥♥♥♥ing around like an idiot (+ a few side quests). When the DLC's start coming out, more hours of entertainment are guaranteed. Character customization in this game is great, even though compact. The player can pick from 4 different classes, one of which is Jew (yeah). Dialogue in this game is suberb, and the writing in general really supports the 4th-grader-theme of the game. It is not required to have ever even watched South Park, you can still enjoy this game. The combat is turn based, it's great, although arguably a bit too easy. The difficulty slider still exists, though. Sense of humor - fantastic. This game even includes Canada, but don't get your hopes up. Game - and level design - fantastic. Art people did a great job as well. You may puke, but you'll have a blast with this game. Absolute must buy for any fans of the show, or for people who have a strong stomach and a love for rpgs."

All the elements that make the show great are poured into this game. From the up front humor of the game's story, to finding little things throughout the town that tie into jokes from the tv show, the game is great. I mean, you have a fart button! You play a new kid in town so you get to create your own South Park kid and jump into the fun.Graphics:Nothing fancy, but the point is, it looks exactly like the show, and that really helps you feel like you are contributing to an actual South Park episode. Noticed here and there a few graphic glitches on my outfits that didn't quite work with the hair style I picked, but that was mainly the DLC outfits for pre-ordering. Other than those, it's been fine.Gameplay:Gameplay is pretty solid. Standard turn based RPG. You choose a class, Fighter, Mage, Thief, Jew. Each has special abilities, but really any class can use any item or armor, each will just have different perks. You can use an item on your turn if you choose, then also use an attack ability. Not like early Final Fantasy games where an item uses up your turn, the catch is you can only use one item per character turn to keep it fair.Attacks are fun, certain attacks have certain button combos you will hit to perform, so you're not just clicking attack then watching an animation. So it keeps you engaged in the fight.There are a few button mashing events that are slightly annoying through the game play, I've never been the fastest button masher and for me it's even harder on the keyboard than a controller, so those were kind of annoying, but nothing I could not beat after a few attempts. The game does support controller options so I'm sure that does help for those instances.Story line is pretty great, great humor, and good twists so far. This is definitely a mature game, not for kids and not for people that can't handle dirty humor, nudity, drug use, sexual jokes, violence and tons of swearing. But if you love those things, you'll love this game. It's worth the $60 price tag, and will definitely be worth it when it goes on sale for anything less."

The fights are fun and interesting, and the bosses are not a walk in the park. If you are just a South Park fan, and only want to see the content I suggest you lower the difficulty. I personally am enjoying the skill needed to kill some of these amazingly fun fights.

,Recommended,213670,26400440,"Posted: 3 November, 2016",all,AllonBachuth,"While I would recommend this game, and I will list the reasons why, I need to start off with the negatives.The save system is probably the worst I've ever seen in a big budget RPG. You can save anywhere anytime into any file you want - except you can't. You can create a new copy of your last autosave from the last checkpoint you passed, but that's it. In a later part of the game I went through a cave, killed some monsters, got some loot, saved a guy and made him and the Canadian Princess my friends, and I went back into Ottawa. Saved. Quit. Reloaded and was put back in the cave. Sure I only lost a couple of minutes worth of progress, but how stupid is this? For a game that I beat in 13 hours, I should be able to save the minutiae of my equipment changes.Also, I beat the game in 13 hours on normal difficulty, no guides used. This is a fair length as there's no downtime in the story, there's a whole bunch of sidequests I didn't do, and there's replay value in playing as other classes. Is that enough to buy the game off sale? Your mileage may vary.While the story had no downtime, it didn't set up the final dungeon and bosses very well. I expected the story would be the first week of New Kid's stay in South Park, maybe 5 days. As day 3 drew to a close and the game was over, it caught me off guard. I'd been thinking of other things they could've added into the game, and what the logical progression of the main story would be. So while it wrapped up nicely, there wasn't a good buildup to it.I had some issues with the controls. I used the 360 controller setup, and I never got fully accustomed to all the uses of the triggers and right analog stick, but that's on me. More importantly, I blame the game for the problems I had with tutorials and combat. The tutorials did a bad job of informing me why what I just did wasn't what it asked me to do. Combat is worse. Sometimes the terminology is iffy - a character's melee attack comes with the instruction of ""Tap A when you see the blink"", and I read tap as a repeated action, not as a single press.But melee attacks are learned quickly; they have the same blink that comes with a sound prompt that gets you to press A or X at the right moment. All abilities aren't as forgiving; they'll tell you what to do, but not give any great visual or auditory clue of when to do it. They'll tell you ""too soon"" or ""too late"", but without an on-screen prompt it's still hard to learn the timing. Still, sometimes you'll get prompts for an ability or to dodge a boss's special move - even that can suck when it expects you to mash a random button and the strict countdown begins before you acn react to which button you're supposed to press.That being said, moving on to the positives;I really enjoyed the combat. There are some comparisons to be made to the classic pre-Wii Paper Mario games in that you have two choices of physical attacks (normal or ranged), enemies stand in lines so you can only use your normal attack on the guy in the front, and the timed button prompts of your actions significantly impact the effects of attacks.I also enjoyed non-combat victory conditions that give me EXP. Gotta look around for not-quite-Rube Goldberg contraptions and set them up with a shot or fart to take out enemies before they can act. It almost felt a shame to pass on the opportunity to take part in the great battle system, but sometimes I just wanna save my speed potions for the boss, you know?The graphics and voice acting are all 100% South Park, it's clear they had the people on board. Wandering around town, you can hear all sorts of music from the TV series being played over radios or whatnot.I haven't watched South Park in years, and I didn't feel lost in any sense. I think they did a great job of retaining the identity of the show without alienating casual fans.The amount of customization you can do with your appearance, your equipment, your abilities and perks is staggering.The amount of sidequests that were made available to me exploring the town on day 1 were overwhelming.Canada. Videogame jokes in a videogame that could only work in a videogame and yet be totally in line with South Park's portrayal of Canada."

Rarely have I been disappointed with what these guys have done, but there are some really obvious things that need fixing in this game.  I've only got an hour into the game so far, but these things are seriously detracting from the enjoyment of the game in my view. These flaws in my view are annoying as a gamer, not so much as a South Park fan.  Flaws first, pros later.Flaws -Battle system: After selecting an enemy to attack, you have to hit the button when the flash goes off. Amount of damages is  based on reaction time. Typically it is a skill based thing with combo attacks or abilities. No so much here. But that might be due to this being tactical turn based in game play.Battle Locations : Climbing a ladder to a billboard walkway gets me an encounter with two enemies. Instead of the battle taking place on the walkway, the battle is moved to the street below. An encounter with an enemy dog on one screen, but the battle takes place to the left of that screen.UI : No ability to adjust sound for UI interface separate from in game sound effects. The booming sound going from game to map/inventory gets annoying fast. Turning it down means turning down all other environmental sound effects.Map location :  Does not accuratley show your position on the map compared to where you are in the game. I can stand left side  of the Cinema and the map shows I am still at Tweak's Coffee House (two buildings to the right).UI Map/Inventory Abilities.  On the first tab, everything is visible, when clicking on other tabs, it overlaps everything else instead of staying within the confines of the screen outlay.  It's also to ... clean, not something you expect with the animation style of South Park.Collection of items : Inability to collect certain items eventhough it looks like you should be able to reach. Example an item under a park bench is not accessible. No popup interaction menu. And after smashing a wall grate I cannot get the item right behind it.Fast Travel : At times I want to fast travel to a location like back to Cartman's house, but I don't want to be IN Cartman's house as there is something close by I want to check out. So each time you fast travel there, you have to go through the whole house again.ProsOverall the game looks and feels like South Park.  Atmosphere is quite full and has lots of nice audio clips from many episodes. Some inside jokes you will get. The voice acting is what you expect and all the characters are there as well. I will continue to play it and provide an update to see if things get better.You will get some good laughs out of it, but the game might really be for the hardest of the hardcore South Park fans.  If you are not then I'd suggest waiting for the game to go on sale.  It won't be worth 60$ to you."

To be clear, The Stick of Truth really gives you a genuine South Park experience, the story is good, the gameplay features are nicely set to the narrative background and the gags are funny.So, what's the problem? Many who want to buy this game are South Park fans -I am as well-, ok, but beeing a fan doen't prevent me to see some ""big"" flaws: this title rely on the narrative part, and it's a great part, but as a game, and turn based rpg, it doesn't offer much.Here my pros and cons:PROS- Story, great story, worth of a South Park movie,- Graphics, like a real episode, not highest standards of course, but it delivers all you need to ""feel"" the South Parl atmosphere,- Gags, it's a South Park game, gags are foundamental, and they works great,- Gameplay Features, features are very bound to the South Park setting, contributing to create a unique experience.CONS- Game Lenght, there are few hours to play, on a normal difficulty you'll beat the game in about 20 hours,- Playable Characters, compared to others turn based rpg, you'll have 6 companions only to use in your party and just 4 summons,- Level Cap, 15 levels and that's it, character progression will stop and you'll reach it long before game's end (you could unlock some more ""perks"", related to number of ""friends"" you make, but also this possibility is limited), this makes further encounters useless exept for loots,- Character Customization, there are just for basic classes, some cosmetics and equipment you'll find/unlock during the game, but (again) not a great varaiety compared to other good rpgs,- Longevity, unless you're a huge South Park fan and you love keep wandering in it, you want to unlock all achievements or maybe try other classes, you probably won't play it a second time.CONCLUSIONI still recommend this game cause it's funny, well made and it gives some hours of good time. It isn't very difficult, but this is a very subjective aspect, some prefer easy games others difficult ones, so if this is in PROS or CONS depends on you.It should have been longer and deeper, but if you're a South Park fan (or you like gags and comedy) it won't be a problem. Keeping in mind that South Park fans will probably be very amused but turn-based rpgs fans could be disappointed, I think its price is a bit high for what it delivers, so buying it on sale is the best option (I know it always is, my point is that I don't see a game value worth of the full price).Well, whatever you decide, have fun guys!"

,Recommended,213670,9356895,"Posted: 5 March, 2014",all,Rabieshijax,"If you are a South Park fan, this is a must have. The Stick of Truth is a long South Park movie starring you. The game has tons of nods to previous episodes from the series, I spent several hours just exploring the town checking things out. The gameplay is similar to Paper Mario. It's a turn based RPG that gives you bonuses for well timed button presses durring attacks and defensive actions. These end up playing a vital role in surviving during your battles. The controls and certain ""puzzles"" can actually be a little confusing at times and some tutorials are obnoxious if you don't put in the correct inputs.  Unfortuneatley the game is very short for an RPG style game. If you do just the main story line you may easily come in under 10 hours. If you do all of the extra content you might be able to squeeze out 20 hours. By the end of the game I was sastified with all the hype that I carried coming into the release of this game having laughed myself silly several times through the course of the game.So in Summation:Buy it now if your a HUGE fan of South Park, you will not be displeased with the story, otherwise pick it up during the upcoming steam sale."
,Recommended,213670,9363148,"Posted: 6 March, 2014",all,ChristopherClever,"I'm super cereal.There are some badly designed games out there that tack on a popular name (TWD:Survival Instinct, Colonial Marines), but don't hold up to the quality of the show/movie itself. Fortunately, for any South Park fan, this isn't the case with The Stick of Truth. Some jokes can fall flat, but this game holds its own and there were several times when I had to pause the game to let my laughter die down (any scene with Randy).A lot of people are complaining about the short game time, comparing it to games like Skyrim, which boasts 100+ hours of game time. I can attest that if you rush through this game, you will finish it rather quickly. However, many people pay $60 for games from the Call of Duty or Assassin Creed series, and end up with a 5-6 hour campaign. South park's game time easily tops games like this and in no way is claimed to be as extensive as a game like Skyrim, which promotes a world 100x bigger than the little mountain town of South Park.My solution was to take my time with the game. Before I even finished the first story quest, I was already exploring houses, garages, back alleys, and stores. I followed through with side quests and found myself enjoying most of them. Every now and then, I'd lead myself back to the story quests to push myself forward, only to find more side quests I wanted to do (Howdy Hooo). This kept the game fresh, and here I am, 15 hours in and I still haven't beaten the game on normal difficulty. Maybe I'm just not as fast as some of these other people, but just like with sex, it's best to take your time with such quality fun and stop rushing to the end result. ;)This game isn't without its faults, but I paid full price and as a South Park fan, I'm satisfied with my purchase. When I beat the game, I will be going back to play it once more on hardcore mode (apparently Cartman has different dialogue if you play as a Jew), to get any missed items, trophies, etc. And just like with the Arkham series, I'm happy to do so.Pros:- Graphics, characters, and voices match the show accurately.- Fun rpg mechanics similar to that of Paper Mario. Enjoyable. Cool combat elements, summons, buffs/debuffs.- Enough side quests and collectables to let you soak in the South Park atmosphere and extend playtime.- Typical South Park humor in the form of jokes, obscenities, and surprise encounters. (Hint: Walk into people's houses.)- You get achievements for farting on people, what more could you want?Cons:- Weapons and armor are a little unbalanced and the number of them seems unnecessary.- Could be more difficult, no alternate game mode (New Game+, etc).- Not an extensive rpg, like most people think. More of a south park exploration game with rpg elements.- Ingame timer seems glitched. I've played for 15 hours, in game says 8 hours.- Game feels worth $30-40, not $60. I got my money's worth, but other people might not feel the same.Overall score: 7/10.Summary: Play this game and take your time with it. Soak it in and enjoy it for what it is. Comparing it to games like Skyrim will only get you disappointment. This game holds its own merit and is an accurate representation of the South Park universe, filled with laughs and hilarious references. South Park fans with enjoy it.It's worth playing, even if you have to wait for it to go on sale this summer."

Read at your own risk.]Hello everyone, time for a Good, Bad, and Ugly for South Park: The Stick of Truth.Good-This game is a fantastic mix of nostalgia for any South Park fan.  Thanks to Matt and Trey's extensive involvement, you will re-discover memories from the past 17 years of South Park that will excite fans, big or small.-Following the combat regiment of other RPG titles (such as Legend of Dragoon or any Mario-based RPG), fighting allows for more interaction than merely issuing commands.  Providing multiple mechanics including timing, button mashing, and rhythm, South Park: The Stick of Truth provides a quality interactive experience for any long-time RPG fan.-The art style is positively fantastic, once again acreditting the, much appreciated and extensive, involvement of Matt Stone and Trey Parker.  From the Crab-People filled underbelly of South Park to the iconically degraded shores of Canada, every moment is spent as if one were in the comical world the show has created for us.  Short of the extensive navigation and RPG-esque combat, an outside source would be hard pressed to not think they were watching an episode of South Park.-Collectibles and extras!!  This game has absolutely no shortage of side-quests, achievements, and emergent goals to guide the player beyond the core experience of the game.  Fans of the show will find plenty of characters and situational antics regarding many plots of different episodes of the show to fulfil their immersive, and otherwise nostalgic, experience.  The shops and buildings even have iconic songs playing through the building reminiscent of our favorite episodes.  Let's Fighting Love!!!!Bad-Game length.  The game is surprisingly short for the amount of time the creators put into it.  Weighing in at roughly 8-10 hours (while also having checked every nook and cranny I could find and completing every side quests available), the experience is, indeed, short lived.  Multiple character classes give slight replayability, but the lack of moral choices within the game (that have very little to do with any story unfolding, and more just give a momentary sense of comedy at the expense of the situation) leave replayability with the short end of the stick (no pun intended).  Here is to hoping that the ""Downloadable Conent"" button on the main screen isn't just for show and we can expect even more fun from the creators.-No mini-games.  Though the interactive combat, in itself, is somewhat of a mini-game, there are no real distractions from the main compass of goals the main storyline gives you.  Ocassionally referencing some mini-games, like rhythm based DDR, in a satirical manner, there is no way to replay them or create emergent goals for ones-self by going for any higher score or besting time limits.-It's kind of easy.  When I see a lot of abilities, items, and spells at my character's disposal, I'm looking for a strategic, in-your-face kind of meticulousness that is required to overcome great obstacles.  Unfortunately, the majority of the game can be won by simply using basic attacks.  The rest seems to simply be nostaglic and character-related fluff.  Once you've seen an ability, rarely does it provide much benefit to see it again, short of wanting to immerse in the character creation and really get into the world of South Park.  The items themselves seemed to be too varied and I could never tell exactly what I was trying to lean toward based on the class that I chose.  There is no real limitation, as any kind of equipment can be equipped, regardless of the class one chooses, but there is still little familiarity when trying to pick a specific goal to pursue in regards to item and item-ability combination.Ugly-Inefficient guidance and feedback through the game.  Now, I feel I must insist at first, I hate when a game hand-holds through the game play.  That being said, it is almost more frustrating when there is very little information provided on what one is supposed to actually be doing to progress.  While there are a few obvious moments that come up, such as the ""oh, that's for an item I won't have until later in the game"" moments, there are more that, even having the item, doesn't provide viable feedback on what ability or action is supposed to be used in certain sitautions.  This led to many frustrating moments where, while obvious in retrospect (Captain Hindsight!), were almost cripplingly annoying.-No retroactive navigation.  With all of the collectibles in the game, there is no mechanism that allows one to re-visit some previously adventured areas.  This means that if you fail to collect that Chinpokomon on a level, you will not have the opportunity to get it back, EVER.  While meticulous and rigorous adventuring is fun, limiting players from being able to retroactively collect all of the non-essential items in the game, even post-endgame, seems a bit conflicting with the style that players tend to enjoy games.  I love finding things throughout the game, but I love even more to go back after all is said and done and finally get everything that I may have passed up while immersing myself into the gameplay.-Fart jokes and poop humor.  This one is obviously more subjective than the others, but man do I have a huge distaste for such things.  Obviously, one could expect nothing less in anything South Park, so it isn't a particularly crippling experience.  However, prepare yourself for quite the experience, despite which end of the spectrum you fit on this scale.  I don't want to spoil too much, but let me just say this: You right-click, you fart.  'Nuff said.Overall score: 8/10"

I was wary at first because I loathe turn-based RPG games, but in true South Park fashion the game parodies the mechanics to make it fun to play and challenging (at least to non-TBRPG players).    You play the new kid in town who finds himself caught in a power struggle over The Stick of Truth between the Cartman-led humans and the Kyle-led Elves.  Naturally, there's more to the Stick of Truth than either of these two sides realize, and soon you find yourself the only one who can save the town of South Park from an unforseen darkness!  The whole town is there for the player to explore and fart on when not doing the story missions.  The developers took the time to include as many main and side characters in the show's lore as the game could hold I think, and really helps with the feeling that you are IN South Park.  The only drawbacks are the story campaign is almost too short, sometimes the keyboard controls are not instantly intuitive, and mission objectives can be VERY vague leaving one to wonder, ""what the hell am I suppossed to do??""Pros:  Excellent production design: Visuals, sound effects all straight fromt he show itself.  Voice acting is top-notch to go along with the great writing.  Main and side quests vary and are fun to play through.  Lots of options for different types of play: Warrior, Mage, Jew, etc.Cons: A bit on the short side, limited replayability unless you want to explore all the different character classes, keyboard controls for certain powers can be confusing, vague mission objectives at times.Again, fans of the show should enjoy it since it's about as close to playing an episode of South Park as one can get."

I love the show, and playing this was my first experience with their games (I hear the others are really bad but, I don't know first hand). I laughed all the way through, I thought the gameplay was amazing, and it was great. Normally I hate turn-based games, with few exceptions like Pokemon or old Final Fantasy or Paper Mario. This game actually brought me a feeling of nostalgia, not just because I watched South Park throughout my life, but the nostalgia of using the turn-based system that's comparable to Paper Mario.

I've been a gamer for nearly 22 years now and I've learned that Liscensed games are something to stay away from. With SP:TSOT, this is not the case. Not only you get a game that is faithful to the show (it literally feels like you're playing on one of those epic episodes), but you get a very neat, fun to play, easy-to-learn, classic style RPG.So far I've only done one main quest, but thanks to the game being completely open-world, I spent almost four hours exploring town and doing other side quests next to my buddy Butters.If you're a South Park fan like me, this game is the ultimate gift for yourself! If you're not very familiar with the franchise, it still an extremely well done game and it shall not disappoint a bit. Kuddos to the developers and also to Trey and Mark for this gaming masterpiece.Pros:-Amazing graphics (It's like watching an episode.

It is like playing an episode of the show.  There are so many references to the show (as to be expected) that there is a certain joy you get remembering which episode they were from.  As a South Park fan the Stick of truth did exactly what any episode of the show did, I laughed (a lot), I gasped (a lot), and I wonder how the creators of the show/game get away with half the stuff they show in here.  Either way it is amazing.  Gameplay wise I will say it took a little bit for the game to get going.  Try to get through Day 1 and the game gets a hell of a lot better.  The combat, which is turn-based, is engaging enough not to get boring.  Having said all this, if you are not a South Park fan, then I don't think the gameplay elements are enough  to keep you interested in the game.  It works, but that is about it.

This means that you should not expect a game with hundreds of hours worth of playtime, or any other twist or turns, or morality based storylines. This is literally an incredibly extended episode of the show, and because of that it has to be extremely streamlined for fans of the show as well as casual gamers. So think of it as a ""beginners RPG"" where you have 1 main quest which is esentially the meat and potatoes of an episode of the show, and the side quests which don't branch off into extended side plots or have any effect on the main story, they are mearly there to serve as fanservice for die hards of the show. So if you love the show, and are looking for an enterance into the RPG genre of gaming this is a good game to choose, just don't choose this to be a gold standard in the RPG market.

You just find a broken combo and stick with it, even though you may upgrade your stats youll still have the same add ons and patches.The quick time events get really numbing after awhile, you can only stand to hear jimmy do the same poem so many times before it becomes a chore and not funny anymore.Walking around town can be awkward even with the fast travel areas, some places are not well defined on if you can walk there or not.The user interface in my playthrough was terrible and I don't know if it was a bug or not but I couldnt scroll via the arrows presented in the ui to scroll through my items, i had to manually click on one and then hit the down arrow until I found the right items.  Navigating the map is clunky as well with a click and drag style that is awkward when also trying to search for target locations in the world.tl;dr dont get this game unless you are a south park fan, and even then only get it on sale as the gameplay does not match up to the story telling and is not worth full price."

A lot of reviews remarked on how short it was - I disagree. It really isn't that short at all. If you like, or have ever liked South Park, this game is for you. If you don't like the humor even slightly - I wouldn't get it.I normally don't giggle at games, but I found myself laughing rather often through the game. It is far more funny than even the best episodes offer. Nearly every character or sets of characters from the entire series is either referenced or shows up at some point. Nearly every area of south park is used at some point, and some of the plot twists or surprises actually left me delighted.Normally a game will fail to keep me interested or engaged throughout itself, but this game is extremely dynamic. It changes ALL the time. Goals change, areas change, scenery, enemy types, gameplay changes - it is WONDERFUL. There is SO much packed into this game, it certainly shows me why it had such a high initial price tag. I got it on sale for a little over $10 and it is worth far far more than that. A great game, one that I cannot praise enough.Buy it, you seriously won't regret it. It's very fun, and only gets more and more fun and engaging as the game goes on.

I just wish there was more to do in this game.

Being the super fan that I am, I took the chance and shelled out the cash. May be the best decision I've ever made. If you are a fan of the series you will be baffled by the amount of detail and references they put into this project. I am only several hours in, and have spent more time on sidequests than the main story like I do on pretty much any open ended game...but every quest is full of signature South Park humor, it really does feel like you're taking an active part of a whole epic episode arc. 9.5 hours in and I am already satisfied with the money I spent, and know this story will only get more outrageously excellent. 10/10 this is the best game I've played in a long while.

I haven't seen every episode (I'd say I've seen roughly half of the series), so there some references that left me wondering, but overall still enjoyable.I think the premise of being a new kid, and stepping into a fantasy themed, imagination based game is very clever. This appealed to me as my favorite South Park scenarios are those where they're doing kid things, and hijinks ensue.One note, this isn't the best one to play with a Steam Controller. I found the right stick and lack of vibration made the magic hard to work with. I ended up switching back to a 360 controller when necessary."

76561198037293906,Recommended,213670,13355983,"Posted: 13 December, 2014",all,Archovio,"I will just start off by saying that this game is very good.  There are a few quirky controls and frankly that is the only big issue I can find with the game other than the overall length.The characters and dialogue are 100% South Park so if you enjoy the show, this game will be more of the same type of jokes.  Most of the characters, even very minor ones, from the show make an appearance at some point.The combat system is fairly well done.  Attacking is very easy and you will be performing non stop perfect attacks within the first 20 minutes of playing the game.  The defensive side of combat takes some getting used to though as each enemy has multiple different attacks that all need to be timed differently to get ""Perfect"" blocks which will greatly reduce the damage you take.  It only takes getting hit a few times though to get most of them down.  I played on normal difficulty and did not have much trouble with any of the fights.  I only had to replay three I think and only because my teammate died to an enemy attack and the enemy died to bleed or fire damage after it killed him which would have voided a playthrough long achievement had I kept going and not reverted to a prior save.The quests in the game are not overly tedious and you are not really kept in any area long enough to get bored with it.  The downside to this was that I ended up finishing up the last of my playthrough around the 20 hour mark which is a bit short for an RPG.  If I had to add one thing to this game, it would have been about 10-15 more side missions.The controls are good save for some placed where you must perform on screen commands.  I played using an XBOX 360 controller and some of these events were just brutal.  Learning the first spell from Cartman took me like 10 tries.  There is another part, towards the end of the story, where using a controlled will make you pull your hair out.  To remain spoiler free, you will know it when you get there and there are numerous threads discussing it.  When you have to spin the stick for this part, placing my palm on the stick and spinning it as fast is possible is the only way I made it.  Others have said that quitting and starting up the game with mouse and keyboard is much easier.Overall, I would give this game a solid 8/10.  If it were another 15 hours or so longer, that score would be higher."

It took me about 10 goes to get through a training moment learning ""magic"", but once I got back into the game I found doing that ""magic"" was earier then how the game taught me!!!!!Also... there is a moment at the VERY end where you have to do an abortion, and it just doesn't work sometimes.But...despite all those little snags... the game is EXTREMLY funny and well worth the play.

,Recommended,213670,9406013,"Posted: 9 March, 2014",all,ALTUS PRIME,"Great game if you're a fan of the show, and if you couldn't care less for the t.v. program then you're getting an alright RPG with South Park's trademark humour.- I believe I was able to grab most of the sidequests in the first of the game's three acts, although a couple will have to be completed as the story progresses.-There's a ton of equipment and items to collect as well as people to meet in your journeys, which in of itself is a collectathon, as the more friends you make the more perks you can unlock for your character.- You will gain certain abilities for both in and out of combat, as well as some that are exclusively designed for exploration. These latter abilities can be used for getting more gear and items, however  the effort necessary to re-explore the town to find these hidden caches might put a damper on their overall usefulness.- I never really felt like the game was that difficult, even on the hardest setting possible right from the start. I even gave the AI an accidental handicap by mismanaging my upgrade points! To explain: in my first run I was a warrior, and ended up wasting most of my points in my first three powers. But I managed to drop one point in my final and most destructive power, giving it more damage based off my armor score. Combat for me was then entirely based off how much armor I had from my gear, and how much I could slough off the enemy (if they had any: if not, they were already dead). To go back to my previous point, for my character only a select few armor sets were worth pursuing purely for combat purposes. Anything else was just to collect for an achievement.All in all this is a decent game. Maybe not worth the $60 for how much game you get (I thought the game was about half way through, when really I was approaching the end), and definitely not worth it if you're not a fan of South Park in general, as most of the humour will derive from references within the show. However if you are, you're in for 15+ hours of ""pretty funny"", mixed with some truly ridiculous laugh out loud moments."

Every quest in the game has meaning and purpose and a reward that suites. While the game may be only 12ish hours long ( I did do every side quest) , every moment in the game is a joy.The only thing that you can complain about is the combat system. The combat system is not terrible by any means, it's very responsive, easy to use, and all the moves are satifying to use. The one flaw that the combat system has is the players involvment, its limited to pushing a a button at the right moment or mashing a button.Overall, i'd recommend South Park STOF to any rpg fan and fans of the show.9/10"

,Recommended,213670,33269116,Posted: 5 July,all,TheFancyRoman,"South Park holds a special place in my heart (and in my DVD shelf). I have been watching it for years. There are good episodes and there are bad episodes but mostly the entire series is good. So now they decided to make a game on this series. The best part of this is that Trey Parker and Matt Stone were actually part of making the game. It wasn’t just a random fighting game with a South Park paintjob and brand.The entire game is around 16h for the main storyline and the side missions but it can go up to 20h if you want to find all the Chinpokomon, kindergarteners and hobos.  A 30€ game (7.50€ if on sale) which delivers 16h worth of South Park episodes is pretty good if you ask me.I don’t want to spoil the plot because it is so random and so damn good but I will say this: The plot feels like multiple South Park episodes taped together, which is good for the most part. Some parts are a little more tacked on than others but they are still good. They just don’t fit in nicely.The combat is fun but becomes repetitive after you find the correct combinations of attacks and the most powerful weapons. Most of the bosses are just enemies with ten times the HP. Just a grindfest. Most of the weapons are just direct upgrades to the last one and I only had a few moments when I was thinking “Which one of these weapons would be the best in this situation?”.Some sections, like the battery part in Mr. Slave’s♥♥♥♥♥was really hard to figure out. I didn’t have Stan with me and the buddies didn’t give me any sign that they could help, like most other parts like it.The humour is spot on. The customization is good. The voice acting is great.If  you don’t like South Park, then you should propably skip this one but if you do, then this is a must have."

It is recommended for anyone who enjoys the show, RPG's or both.The problems it has is that the game is a little too easy and it is short for an RPG.There is one recurring abortion gag with some ridiculously tedious mechanics that you will need either guess work or a guide to get past and it is used a couple of times in the game making it irritating.And there is little replayability except to make the opposite choices of your first play through and if you are a completionist.In the end it is quite a funny and well made South Park RPG that takes the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of the gaming industry and everything in general as Trey Parker and Matt Stone are well known for that will leave you satisfied you played as if you had watched the show."

You are truly getting what you pay for here, no funny business (Apart from all the jokes which are hilarious).Not only is this game a must-own for all fans of the show, but its also a very fun RPG to-boot! Combat is very similar to the turn-based combat of Final Fantasy VII, but everything has its South Park twist. You are free to roam around South Park, meeting its residents and finding interesting side-quests to complete. I've already met Al Gore, unfriended him, defeated ManBearPig, been abducted by aliens, bitten by gingers, killed by Nazi Zombie Kittens and watched my parents have sex while I was battling giant rats in the wall.

,Recommended,213670,13788919,"Posted: 2 January, 2015",all,ECOSTA,"Fantastic game. The whole way through, the experience feels like watching a really good South Park episode or South Park movie, and the game is a *really* solid RPG, to boot.But the game isn't without its flaws. I want to spend a few paragraphs on some criticisms of the game, and then we'll talk about what makes the game awesome.The game feels heavily ""consolized."" Loading screens are far more frequent than they should be and the controls often don't make much sense. Throughout the game your character will be taught ""magic spells"" from various NPCs. Each time you learn a spell, you are taught a series of controls to use that spell. However, these spells can be used both in and out of combat, and in both situations the controls are different from one another—and in neither situation is the spell invoked the same way the game inititally taught you!Your out-of-combat utilities (like firing a ranged weapon at something in the environment or sending a buddy to perform a task) are equally awkward to select and use.Now, here I should note that I played with a controller attached to a PC. I started the game with a keyboard/mouse but changed very, very early on to give my normal gaming posture a rest (I play games a lot with the keyboard/mouse), and also because South Park: The Stick of Truth seemed to be tailored more toward a controller. Perhaps the controls are better with a keyboard/mouse, but using a controller felt awkward in many parts of the game. But not in combat. In combat the controls felt great. More on that later, though.On top of that, the game's humor can be off-putting in some parts. This isn't a real criticism so much as it is a warning—it IS South Park, after all! The show has a reputation of making comedy material out of even the most sensitive of topics, and this game also doesn't hold back. I like to think of myself as a fairly easy-going guy and I try not to take many things too seriously, but there were parts in this game that I felt myself somewhat rushing through or avoiding just to get away from an uncomfortable topic.There's a lot of back-and-forth running around the map in this game, and loading screens are absolutely everywhere. The loading screens are a real slowdown.So let's see. The loading screens, the really iffy controls in much of the game, and the warning about how the game remains very South Park in its humor are all the things I wanted to make sure to mention. So, now we can talk about the stuff that makes this game a fantastic one!While moving on the map and navigating menus is often awkward with the game's controls, combat is something the game gets very, very right. As I mentioned earlier, this game is a very solid RPG, and The Stick of Truth's turn-based combat is airtight. This isn't your typical ""select an ability and watch what happens"" kind of turn-based combat. Here, you'll select an ability, and then you'll influence the outcome of the ability with some simple, but fun controls.For example, Butters the Paladin has a ""Hammer of Justice"" ability. To use it, you select it and then choose a target. The game then has you rotate the left control stick in circles to make Butters spin (think Olympic discus tossing), and at just the right instant, press the A button. Succeed, and you'll deal bonus damage to the enemy! If you mess up, Butters will still deal damage, but not as much. Again, this is coming from the perspective of using a gamepad to control the game; I'm sure this is different for a mouse/keyboard, but the principle is the same.Combat is filled with awesome stuff like this. When you are attacked, most of the time you are given the chance to block some of the enemy's damage by pressing A at just the right time. Some enemy attacks strike multiple times, requiring multiple well-timed blocks! Different enemy attacks have different timings as well, so you'll always need to be on your guard.These combat mechanics make even turn-based combat a very active affair. The action is fast and challenging, so you'll need to be spot on with your controls. Thankfully, controls in combat are responsive and intuitive, and anytime there's some ambiguity about what to do in battle, there are useful tooltips and pop-ups to remind you of how to use an ability.While combat is great fun, the game also very often presents you with multiple ways of dealing with foes. Sometimes you can distract them and sneak by. Other times you can use the environment to defeat your foes without having to confront them. Keen awareness of your surroundings and appropriate use of your abilities out of combat can speed up your progress and yield satisfying results.It should be noted that if you sneak by enemies, you probably won't get experience for dealing with them. But in the cases where you can use the environment to defeat them, you'll be awarded experience as if you had battled them!There are many quests to accomplish throughout the game, and a few side quests can be completed as you progress. As far as questing is concerned, it's your typical RPG fare—pick up a quest, complete the objectives, turn the quest in. The game does nothing to revolutionize questing, but it handles questing very well.The story-based quests, however, are always greatly satisfying to accomplish because you are awarded not only with experience and often loot/money, but also with story exposition done in only the way South Park can. It really does feel like you're earning a little piece of a South Park episode or South Park movie when you complete a story quest.The writing in the game is spot on. You'll get to watch the South Park characters you're so familiar with do the things they do, in the way they do them, while interacting with one another and with your character. I found the story largely fun and interesting.I was often quite pleased with the developers' efforts to include as many South Park characters as they could in the game. This could not have been an easy task to accomplish, but the game is solid through-and-through with the show's characters, and because the show has been running so long, these characters bring with them their histories, backdrops, and references that the South Park fan should thoroughly enjoy.Character customization is very in-depth for a game with such a simplistic visual style. You'll begin the game by choosing a class, and then customizing your looks. As the game progresses, you will find, like, a bajillion different ways to customize your charcter's costume (""gear""), hair, facial features, makeup, and accessories. You'll even find ""strap-ons"" (for weapons) and ""patches"" (for armor) that let you add significant bonuses to your gear, letting you really specialize or round out your character and playstyle.I did make a warning above about the game's humor, but for South Park fans, that (most of the time) means you're in for more of what you enjoy about the show. There were plenty of times I found myself actually laughing out loud at the characters' antics; or at the writing; or at the timing of a joke; or just at South Park being South Park. It's a funny game.There is also a difficulty slider bar. Early in the game I cranked the difficulty to max and didn't look back, and for me, it was quite rewarding. The window of opportunity to block enemy attacks seemed drastically smaller, necessitating more precise timing, and enemies often didn't go down without a fight. I had to stay on top of my gear choices and customize appropriately. Which buddy to bring into battle with me was also a serious consideration, and more than once I had to stock up on potions.Overall, it's just a really solid RPG, and I'd strongly recommend it to any South Park fan. I could go on about it, but I feel I've covered most of the relevant aspects of the game, and apparently Steam has a character limit for reviews. :)"

So if you're ""um""ing and ""ah""ing about it, sorry but I have been sent here to destroy you!Firstly, if you've been a fan of the show since epsiode 1, there is not a chance that you're not going to enjoy this game. From Visitors, to Underpants Gnomes, to ManBearPig...this game has all the best nostalgic references from the show done in a completely new light. You've probably heard that this game is basically an extra season of the show, which is accurate. Except being a game it is uncensored and they were able to take it to new places. What's even better is that it is in RPG format and you create your own character that is assimilated into the game as the new kid (your character never speaks but the other characters make jokes about it). You always have a buddy with you through out the game, you can change your buddy at any time but have to unlock them first & they join you in battle. Once all unlocked you can choose from Butters, Jimmy, Kenny, Stan, Kyle or Cartman (I personally don't think they could have chosen better for the buddies, pretty much my 6 favourite characters, and I won't give away what classes they are because some of them are just hilariously suiting). My final broad description of the game is this: picture a fantasy RPG done from the perspective of the collective imaginations' of the boys (eg, when Cartman cast Ice Storm, he just runs out of screen, then runs back in with a cooler full of icy water and throws it on you!) It's funny stuff, and there are plenty others.It has been said that the combat gets repetitive, but if you are a avid fan of the show & a patient sort of person I don't find this to be the case. There are 4 classes to play as well so surely each of them are different enough to want to explore. The enemies that you face are hilarious in their own right, and side-splitting dialogue is exchanged during battle (eg, Al Gore summons the Secret Service, 4 armed guys in black suits rock up and say ""C'mon, protect the kinda ex-Vice President, kinda...""). All the hilarious familiar faces of South Park make an appearance, and yes you don't even need to ask, Randy is hilarious as always and is involved in a few of the quests that you do. Oh, and in case this is your first window into the game and you HAVEN'T watched any trailers...the game is done in the same animation as the show, so you can't really feel any more like you're engrossed in this quiet little mountain town.I could keep going all day, but perhaps I should just leave it there and say this...If you are a fan of the show, BUY THIS GAME! No chance of regrets. If you aren't a fan of the show, you will still find it funny & enjoy the combat and story etc, but won't understand any of the references from past episodes or dynamics between the characters for that matter. There is a reason this game won so many awards! It is awsome. And with a sequel on the way...I can't wait to see what they have in store for us next"

Thankfully many of the battles can be skipped, or made easier in various ways by exploiting the environment. That is not to say that some of the battles weren't enjoyable or challenging. But the majority of them were to easy (on normal difficulty).The voice acting and graphics are what is to be expected from Southpark however the soundtrack ranges from meh to ugh throughout and is at its best when not noticed.The game took about 14 hours with 48% of the achievements to complete. I don't think a second playthrough will yield enough enjoyment to justify it, but you can continue on after finishing the main story to tie up any loose ends, or achievement hunt if you wish. I personally won't but it's a nice feature.I would give it an 8/10 at the price point I paid (about 10 usd)"

Especially, SP fans there is so many running jokes/references and some things that just made me laugh uncontrollably at times.What I didn't like,The DLC is worthless unless you want to run through the game in the same set of armorHad some graphical issues with characters disappearing during cuts scenes at the end of the game (not too bad or gamebreaking)Collectables can be missed forever.

That should probably be a good indication of how much i liked this game. That said, it does have it pros and cons though.The game is unmistakenly south park, if you do not like the show, do not buy the game. The gameplay itself is quite generic and to be honest really simple, and incredibly easy. I played the entire game on the hardest 'hardcore' difficulty, yet never felt like I needed to make sure my equipment was in top condition, or restock potions, in fact I never ever ran out of potions. On top of that I pretty much ignored using 'magic' in the game, which were supposed to be the kind of OP spells I believe. Despite all of this it was a great game though, the simplicity in the gameplay ensured that the focus of the game lied on storytelling, It is almost as if you are playing in a real south park episode. I feel however that this is not an excuse for such an easy time on the hardest difficulty.Overall this game gets a 9/10,Truly south park, less interesting gameplay."

It calls to a time that reminds me of what it means to be young, and to want to consume every aspect of my games in one sitting. Everything about South Park is fun, and while it may not be challenging, it is everything else and more. Well written script, a beautiful cast of existing characters, tons of collectibles, fantastic summons, sharp references to modern gaming, classic gaming, and self-referencing that will make any fan giddy. Is it worth $60? If gaming has gotten a little stale in the past few months, and you're a fan, then I'd say most definitely yes; but if you're having a great time in other games? I'd say wait. The game maxes out at around 15 hours on Hardcore (which isn't hard), and has little immediate replayability. It is a mostly one and done adventure with a ton of heart, a ton of laughs, and some decent gameplay to get you from point A to B."
,Recommended,213670,13178346,"Posted: 1 December, 2014",all,Steveosaurous,"If you're a fan of South Park, then you probably don't need me to tell you to play this game. It's certainly more than a lame RPG with a South Park skin, but it's less than an a masterpiece that elevates the genre and the source material.Pros:*Funny story from start to finish*Fun to explore the South Park world on your own*Fun, somewhat-deep combat system that even non-rpg fans can enjoy*High quality cut scenes and writing*Good environment varietyCons:*Brings nothing new to the table*No real reason to return to the game after you've completed the main story*NOT for people who have never seen South ParkI feel like the pros are self explanatory, so I'll elaborate on the cons. The game does not introduce any new ideas that do not already exist in the South Park universe. Almost every single joke in the game is a reference to something that is in the show. For fans of the show, like myself, this is a good thing. But this completely closes the door for any non-SouthPark fans. Even in terms of combat, which I found to be very engaging as an RPG-enthusiast, there is nothing new here. The combat is good overall, and much deeper than I expected it to be, but it's still not as deep as what you might find in your typical RPG. There's a good tutorial and scalable difficulty, so even people new to the RPG genre can jump right into the game and have a good time. It comes off as RPG-lite, which is understandable as the game needs to appeal to a broad spectrum of South Park fans.The main story is high quality all the way through, and the writing is solid, but once you've completed the main quest and side quests, there is nothing else to do. You can achievement hunt and look for collectibles, but many of the previous mission areas are inaccessible, and there's no real reason to explore. You won't find a secret side quest that you never knew about, or a mini-boss that you'll have to grind to level 99 to beat. As an RPGer, I found this to be a detriment, as even the old school Final Fantasy games had this.Overall, I had a great time with this game, and I highly recommend to any and all South Park fans. Even those who aren't interested in RPGs. Non-South Park fans would do best to stay away, as there's not enough new things to appeal to people just looking for a good RPG, and almost all the jokes are show-referential."

There are hours of prerendered cutscenes(some skippable)that keep you entertained and immersed in the ""episode"".The Canada part of the game was amazing for me since i lived and breathed the 8 and 16 bit RPGs of my childhood. This omage was the highlight of the game for me. And since the Matrix is my favorite move, i was physically amused by the Nagasaki learning sequence.Four classes for 4x the replay value. I would have liked there to be more class skills and class induviduality, but for the shortness of the game they are able to get away with the simplicity of it.Hundreds of collectable armors, weapons, and flair to make your ""new kid"" look however you want him/her to look. I would advise against getting any DLC as it is all mostly throw-away gear by the time you gain a few levels and can use the stronger higher level equipment.A clever weapon and armorrunesystem that the game playfully refers to as ""stickers"" that can give you the advantage you need to defeat a tough boss.Lots of unique andpunnyachievements to collect, as well as several side-quests that will keep you thinking about what new skills you have gained that will allow access to previously unchartable paths.Controller support so you don't have to use a mouse and keyboard. Mouse and keyboard is to RPGs what controllers are to First-Person-Shooters. Sub-optimal.(Sorry COD and HALO fans)Two difficulty settings, normal and hard(because we don't talk about ""easy"" settings in video games ;P)Cons:Button spamming is a mainstay in games like God of War, and this game unfortunately uses it as a way to disguise an annoying and primitive game mechanic asinteractive. Seriously game devs stop making quick time events and button mashing a thing in videogames; NO ONE enjoys the carpal tunnel required for some of these events.Max level in the game is 15, which is very easy to get to making you regret certain skill choices as you cannot max all skills. (there should have a skill reset option)Trying to track down some of the side quest targets was annoyingand time consuming, but it could be argued that it is part of the quest's challenge.The limited use of the game's ""summons"" is also kind of disappointing, but most of them areboard wipes, so being spamable would make the game too easy.For some people the humor andcertain localesinside a gay man's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ complete with everything you might expect to find up thereof the game could be off-putting to say the least. I however have a pretty lax sense of humor and am not easily offended or grossed out.It's neither a pro or a con, but it should go without saying that this is a game forMature Audiences. Please don't buy this for your kid.Overall the game is a great experience for any fan of South Park or turn based RPGs and it will not disappoint if you enjoy either. Highly recommend and cannot wait for the ""Fractured But Whole"" sequel coming soon.Best. Title. Ever.Rating - 8/10"

Fairly robust RPG elements, good turn based gameplay, and a ""South Park"" style story that was actually pretty solid.  The game is a nice length, taking me about 9-10 hours to complete the main story, plus a couple hours afterwards playing around wrapping up side-quests.  It is a nice length for the game as it they kept it feeling like a lengthened South Park episode rather than a long and grindy RPG.The humour is a little over the top at times, as South Park is, but overall I had a good time with this game. I'm definitely not a huge South Park fan, but if you have seen enough that you will pick up some of the one-liners and can laugh at it's absolutely ridiculous style of humour, then I think you will enjoy this game, definitley not for everyone though.4 ""Ridiculous Jokes Making Fun of Canada"" out of 5"

It is another title by Obsidian Entertainment (Baldur's Gate series, Pillars of Eternity, etc.).  You embark upon the most epic larping-adventure of all time with the cast of South Park, playing as the new kid in town.I really don't want to spoil any of the humor for anyone who has never played the game before, so I won't.  What I can say is that no opportunity for satire is missed in any aspect of the game.  The battle scenarios, the overall plot, the gear, weapons, settings all feature immense content that will make you laugh intensely... all while playing what is actually a pretty challenging RPG.  Nothing else is to be expected from the creators of South Park, Trey Parker and Matt Stone, who seem to always transmute the mediums they touch into gold, whether they take the form of cartoons, musicals or now with this game.  I regard them as some of the best American satirists, even in league with Mark Twain.If you're not from the U.S., you should definitely pick this game up.  It's a great reflection upon our contradicting, somewhat psychotic and multi-faceted culture.  Of course, it IS satire... but nonetheless enlightening on key aspects of our society and the awkward landscape of middle-class, suburban values.The port to PC is pretty good, with some minor irritations.  Also, I am not very fond of the use of key-mashing as a mechanic in games, which Stick of Truth utilizes for a lot of the character abilities.  Still, the gameplay is really fun.  The experience makes you feel like you're a kid again, with all the fart humor, vulgarity and immaturity that made childhood great."

The game literally feels like an interactive episode; this could easily stand alone as a season itself.  The combat system is very reminiscent of the Paper Mario series, which while simplistic hides a little depth, and the writing it top notch.  This is one of the few games to ever actually make me laugh this hard. The only downsides to this game is the length and it's difficulty, it can be beaten in about 14 hours if you do all of the side quests.  This is a bit short for an RPG, however the game has high replayability with it's various classes. With four completely different classes that playtime can easily be quadrupled.  Do I think this game is worth the $60 price tag?  Yes, there is a lot of quality here even if it lacks for quantity. As for the difficulty the game is very easy on it's default setting, and I recommend you turn up the difficulty upon starting.Verdict:  If you are a fan of South Park, get this game."

,Recommended,213670,9392249,"Posted: 8 March, 2014",all,TheSlorg,"A solid game that seems to hit that sweet spot between too much simplicity and being overly complex, particularly with the combat system. The combat is one of the highlights, with the kids using common household items for weapons and armor, and the system is deeper than you might imagine, but still simple enough to remain immersed within the story.And what a story it is. Many have said it already, but this is just like playing through several episodes of South Park. There will be all the jokes you might expect from the show, so those who are easily offended (or have no idea what South Park is – where have you been living the past 15 years or so?) might want to give the game a pass. In fact, it's more like South Park the Movie, as it can get away with a lot more than the show itself can.With tons of characters to befriend and items to find, as well as four classes to play through as, there is plenty of reason to replay the game at least one more time to see it all, for roughly 30 hours total."

Other than that, I love this game.Gameplay: Solid mechanics, can't get more basic than this. A controller is reccomended though. Timed button presses will make you or break you when playing this.Humor: It's South Park. If you don't like South Park's humor or didn't really like the show, you won't like this game. References are everywhere and they range from great to ""Oh yeah, I remember that.""Visuals/Graphics: This game perfectly recreates the show's art style to the point where as many reviewers have said before: ""It feels like you're playing an episode of the show!"". You shouldn't need a powerful or fast PC to get enjoyment out of this, but you might not want to play this game if you're running on a potato. Stick of Truth takes a page out of the book of Mario RPGs, in that timed button presses can affect the flow of gameplay entirely. So a PC lacking in power could make the game a bit less enjoyable.Overall: I wouldn't say its worth the full price of $30, but as of when I'm writing this, the game is about $7 which is well worth the price of this gem of a title. If you enjoy the sickening, but often intelligent humor of South Park, then by all means buy this game.Just don't buy the DLC. Its just some insignificant garbage that the game starts you off with if you want to complete it faster. I regret buying it."

The town itself isn’t too big and fast travel spots help you get around even though I kind of wish there were waypoints on the screen when you’re in the fast travel menu so you can get where you need to go easier. Not a big issue though.The game looks and sounds great and is a perfect video game adaptation of the TV show and I’m really looking forward to The Fractured But Whole which will be coming out next year.  The storyline, characters and visuals are all exactly what you’d want from the tv show and the battle system is a great starting point if a little too similar to the paper Mario games. Bump up the difficulty a touch as well and maybe allow more than one partner in battle at a time…. Could spice things up!For the full review check out my video!https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecDENHito5M"

The Stick of Truth is completely entertaining and does a good job making you feel like you are in a South Park episode.  Having the original voice actors for South Park and the writing are spot-on.There are 4 playable classes and you gain new/enhanced abilities as you gain levels and popularity.  The only negative I found in the entire game is I hit the level cap (15) about 35 hours into the game as I was trying to complete every side-mission.Combat is turn based while you control your character and one active 'buddy.'  Timing of spells/attacks (clicking when the game flashes) is key successfully casting/attacking.  Weapons and armor can be used by any class and are modifiable with 'patches' that can be purchased/found in-game.Travel is aided by fast-travel 'Timmy' to quickly move between 12 predetermined way-points."

I wish that this game had a new game +, or at least some more end game side quests.I basically did all the side quests while doing the main storyline. I also didn't like how there was no one to fight with towards the end of the game.Other than that, if you can get this game for cheap, I say buy it my reason is because it doesn't have much of a replaybility as one would expect, but one play through is more than enough, unless you want all of the achievements."

Even if your not a fan of South Park, I'd easily recommend this for your first RPG. Hell, even if it isn't your first RPG. It's a fantastic game all around.

Secondly: Trey Parker and Matt Stone (the show's creators) had executive input over this, meaning that the game is a perfect rendition of the show; whether it's the writing, sharp humour or the visuals. You are, in effect, playing through an episode.Obviously then, if you dislike the show - turn away now. If the small shopping list of reasons why this is an 18 game isn't a hint, this game takes no prisoners. Simply put: You need to be cool with attacking Nazi-Zombie aborted foetuses.If you can stomach that, then the rest of the game will be peachy. There's a huge amount of laugh-out-loud moments to be had, aided by the cracking dialogue, lovable characters and obscene number of references to the show... And Randy Marsh. Everything is better with Randy Marsh. It's a fun story that parodies the RPG genre as much itself, frequently hinting how it's just kids in costumes playing humans vs elves.The game itself is a turn-based action-RPG. What's neat is that you need quick button presses to pull off attacks and block incoming ones; with special moves obviously requiring a bit more. It adds a nice level of skill to the game, even though I still frequently manage to skewer Kenny onto a unicorn. There's a great selection of weapons and kit too, providing a surprisingly wide arrange of abilities, particularly where some weapons can hit a whole column, pierce targets or work best when there are multiple enemies on screen. That said, the character classes are a tad disappointing. Though they have some starting differences, there's not much change in terms of playstyle, especially where you tend to swap out your class-specific kit for the generic in-game pickups anyway. All 5 special moves tend to follow the same pattern as well: Single target damage, stun attack, defence down... and so on.And for all its variety, it does err on the side of easy, even with the difficulty cranked to the top. With ridiculously overpowered damage-over-time effects like bleed/fire (we're talking shreds 50% HP here), any veteran of the RPG genre will likely have little trouble aside from the odd fight or 2. It's not a challenging game, but the interactive combat at least makes it engaging and fun. You can get a decent 10-15 hours out of a playthrough, which can feel a little short, but is at least engrossing and enjoyable enough to warrant multiple playthroughs to try new things out.All in all, a very rewarding must-have for those who love the show."

One of the greatest achievements of The Stick of Truth is its ability to immerse the player in the South Park universe. To put it plainly: The Stick of Truth achieves greatness by it's ability to stay faithful to the original TV show while providing players with an interesting story and satisfying gameplay to boot.Gameplay is somewhat repetitive (but still satisfying), but that is more a fault on the genre. The game is a 2-D turn-based RPG, so most combat sequences will follow a similar pattern, with some variation in strategy from one character to the next.I liked it enough to play through twice."

The graphics are perfect, and while I did see some of the screen tearing other reviews noted, it did not detract from the experience. The story is as many others have said, a 14 hour long episode. As a long time fan of the show, it was nice to see several references - the game also went a few places I was not expecting (Mr. Slave for instance). A true accomplishment is an explorable ""South Park"" itself; it makes a difference when you can explore the town as a whole rather than just piecing together components from what  the TV show provides episode to episode. Overall, the story was just long enough to be worth the playthrough without dragging. For instance, while there are several moments where you are on fetch quests, the developers put a  ""South Parkesque"" spin put on each one, so I did not find them annoying in the least. It truly is an example of a whole being better than a sum of its parts. I am guessing replay will be low for me, but considering I bought it during a sale, worth every penny paid."

For South Park fans, anyway.Initially, the children of South Park are playing a simple town-wide game; like a huge LARP without the dice and casual brawling, but the situation escalates hideously, partly thanks to the ineptitude of grown-ups around the world, and as happens so often, the children have to work together to save the world from itself.The story and the dialogue was put together by Trey Parker and Matt Stone, and it is exactly like an episode of South Park with you, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ the New Kid, as the protagonist. There's some enemies, but since enemies scale with your level and you level up pretty quickly, and your HP restores to full after every battle, it's obvious that this game isn't about the fighting (although the fighting is deeper than you'd expect it to be); it's about the story, exploration, and questing.I love it, but then again, I thoroughly enjoy South Park.

,Recommended,213670,18640344,"Posted: 23 October, 2015",all,Macho Unicorn,"Much like the beloved TV show, South Park: The Stick of Truth is ridiculous, over-the-top, and crude. South Park has taken its shots at the world of video games before, but never with this kind of reverence. At the same time, the game is a celebration of seventeen seasons of the show, drawing references from fan favorites across the entire span of its run. Amazingly enough, the South Park stuff aside, it's actually a really good RPG as well.South Park: The Stick of Truth puts players in the role of the new kid in town. He and his parents just moved to the quiet, Colorado mountain town in order to get away from some bad thing that happened that he has conveniently forgotten about. After being shooed out the door by his parents and told to go make some friends, he discovers that the children of the town are embroiled in what has to be the most amazing LARPing session of all time, all to decide who controls the miraculous Stick of Truth, which gives its bearer control over the universe. He naturally gets drawn into the game, but behind the scenes, the weirdness of South Park is at an all time high. Aliens, secret government organizations, underpants gnomes, nazis, zombies, nazi zombies, and Al Gore all threaten to bring the town to the brink of destruction, unless the new kid can become cool.It should come as no surprise that Stick of Truth looks and feels just like an episode of South Park. The game begins with a terrific character customizer that allows players to generate their own nine-year old kid in the South Park style. Some players may be disappointed to learn that only male characters can be created, but there are story reasons for this, and rest assured, the girls of South Park get their day in the sun as well. Similar to Fallout 3, the appearance of the new kid determines the appearance of his parents as well. The town of South Park has been faithfully recreated, including the vast majority of landmarks seen throughout the show's seventeen-season run, including Jimbo's Guns, Skeeter's Bar, City Wok, South Park Elementary, City Hall, and even Canada. The story possesses unique elements, but also draws from the show's history for events, side quests, and even the miscellaneous junk items.Of course, exploring South Park isn't as easy as it looks. There are a number of places the new kid won't be able to get to, at least not right away. There are locked doors that require keys to open, and rooftops and small spaces that require special abilities to access. In fact, the interactivity of the environment is one of the game's strongest aspects, and even plays a role in combat. By using the various special abilities at the new kid's disposal, as well as the special abilities of his friends, players can find multiple routes through the game's areas, and even make combat easier by defeating enemies beforehand, sometimes in surprisingly ridiculous ways.Stick of Truth's combat involves simple but engaging turn-based battles reminiscent of the Paper Mario series. Near the beginning of the game, players can choose one of four classes — the fighter, the mage, the thief, and the jew — and each class has its own special skillset. Each class learns five special moves that can be used by consuming power points, and can spend points earned each level to upgrade their power. In addition, the new kid can also summon powerful beings like Jesus and Mr. Slave to assist in battle, and harness the magical power of... his farts. He can also bring a single ally into battle, though they can be switched out on the fly at the cost of a single turn.Once battle begins, combat takes place turn by turn, ""just like in medieval times."" The new kid and his ally can perform one healing ability and one attack ability each turn. All attack skills require some sort of timed button input to perform effectively, though they are mostly very easy to perform, and the ones that require a bit more finesse are still plenty powerful even if the player fails.Unfortunately, the game tends to be rather easy most of the time. This is partly compounded by the ease of which players can gain experience. The game caps out at level fifteen, and if players are ardent about completing side quests and exploring the town, the new kid will reach this cap well before the end of the game. The game is much more challenging in the first few hours than it is later on, despite an adjustable difficulty setting. That said, the ease of play is still dictated by successfully performing attacks in combat, and a string of bad inputs can quickly change the tide, right up until the end of the game.Players can also collect a huge assortment of weapons, armor, augmentation items, and accessories like wigs, make-up, and glasses to further customize their character. The number of customization options are mind-boggling, so players should have no trouble making their character their own. Players can also get permanent passive bonuses to various combat functions by earning perks. Perks are earned by gaining facebook friends in the town.One of the most surprisingly excellent aspects of South Park: The Stick of Truth is its audio. The fantastic voice talents of Trey Parker and Matt Stone are certainly wonderful on their own, but an even greater surprise is the music. Not only are there some terrific orchestral pieces that help set the tone, the game is filled to the brim with the goofier songs from the series' history, often playing on radios scattered throughout the town or during particular battle sequences.Some players may wish to be cautious, however, as even by South Park standards, Stick of Truth is particularly crude. Not since the 1999 film South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut has South Park pushed the boundaries of good taste as far as they have here. Players will engage in battle beneath the bodies of two people making sweet, sweet love, perform an abortion, and delve deep inside a man's ♥♥♥♥♥♥. There are alien anal probes and just about every bodily function imaginable, and anyone who is even remotely offendable should stay far, far away.The best thing about South Park: The Stick of Truth is the little things that help bring the town to life. Fans of South Park are definitely not going to be disappointed, and fans of RPGs won't be either. Although the game is fairly short, the quality of the experience is undeniable, and the humor and multiple classes give it a fair bit of replayability as well. And as Obsidian games go, it's also one of the most stable. I didn't encounter a single issue. It took a while to get here, but the wait was well worth it: South Park: The Stick of Truth is sweet."
,Not Recommended,213670,28217125,"Posted: 6 December, 2016",all,markzwaan,"On the one hand I really like how The Stick of Truth manages to feel like an actual episode of South Park. It features a huge cast with pretty much any South Park character you can think of. The typical South Park humor is also there and ranges from mild parody to full on satire.The RPG elements are not as deep as in more serious RPG's but much more elaborate than in a RPG light game as Costume Quest.While I liked a large part of what The Stick of Truth had to offer some elements were either disappointing or left a very sour taste.Since this is a commercial game that is likely to be bought by people who are a fan of South Park and not something that's aired on national tv for anyone to see, the creators apparently thought there were no bounds. And so the game features nazi zombie fetuses (no, that's not a joke) and similar elements (having to descend a gay characters♥♥♥♥♥♥ again not a joke) that seem to be there mainly for shock value and not to amuse. While some people might find these elements hilarious, they didn't amuse me in the least. Luckily the truly funny stuff outweighs these shock elements but still, I wonder why they felt these things had to be in the game.My main reason for ultimately disliking the game has to do with the RPG part of the game. While the RPG system was a bit deeper than I had expected a lot of potential was left unused. You assemble an impressive cast of characters throughout the game. But I ended up playing with the same three characters 99% of the time. Only on very rare occasions was there a need to switch to a different character. While some attacks are more effective than others against certain enemies, only on rare occasions did I need to use a specific character to get past a fight. Part of the fun of a good RPG (in my eyes at least) is selecting the correct combinations of characters (and so the correct weapons and spells) that's necessary to defeat specific (combinations of) enemies. It's why I still like to play FF X and FF X-2. Another part of the fun comes from selecting the combination of gear that either suits your playing style or that is needed to defeat specific enemies. While the game allows you to choose from different characters, ultimately it doesn't really matter which one you choose. You can still use any weapon and wear any piece of armour. The only difference is in the special moves you'll have at your disposal. I've only played through the game once, so I can't say if the games plays any different if you choose to play as a different character. But my guess is that it won't matter much. Similarly some of the puzzles you solve require you to use a specific character similar to Costume Quest. Unfortunately this feature is only used in a handful of puzzles. Which is too bad since this could have been a nice way to give different characters a good reason for being in the game. While The Stick of Truth uses more elaborate RPG systems in some ways in other ways it felt closer to Deathspank where I just let the game choose the best weapons and armour automatically since there is no added benefit of selecting specific gear.In short: is this game worthy of the South Park title? It certainly is. Did I enjoy playing the game? Some if it was great, some of it was kinda okay and some of the game was really, really offensive and not enjoyable at all. Is it a good RPG game? Unfortunately not, there are RPG elements, but they are superficial and poorly implemented. Do I recommend this game? Well, if you're a hardcore South Park fan you'll probably won't bother reading this review nor will it persuade you from buying it. But if you're not a South Park fan but you're just looking for an interesting and funny RPG (light) to play, my advice is to steer clear from this one and look at other games instead."

The story plays out just like a episode with all of the lewd, perverted, dark humor that made the series famous. Its a breath of fresh air with all of the disappointments in gaming as of late.

Watching butters turn into Professor Chaos and either do a bad♥♥♥♥♥move or whiff and turn back into poor butters depending on if you hit the mark or not can be incredibly satisfying.I usually lose interest in a game because i play so much of it and get kind of burned out but i never had that feeling because the story kept pulling me back in.

,Recommended,213670,24132192,"Posted: 6 July, 2016",all,Halflight,"South Park: The Stick of Truth is a turn-based roleplaying videogames developed by Obsidian Entertainment and takes place in the South Park setting: your character is a new kid just arrived in town who gets immediately involved into a large-scale LARP organized by the series' protagonist. Predictably, the game soon gets out of hand as increasingly gross and dangerous events start plaguing South Park.As the New Kid, a male kid whose apparel you can completely customize, you can choose between four classes: wizard, thief, warrior or jew (a special class specialized in debuff and who gets stronger as he gets debuffed in return). The class of choice only determines the kind of abilities you can unleash on your enemies, as gear and weapons are completely class-free. On top of your set of abilities, you will learn special magic moves (farts) as the story progresses, as well as one-per-day summons. Weapons and pieces of armor can also be ""enchanted"" by applying different stickers to them, which grant the Kid special passive effects. While levelling up allows you to unlock new class abilities or empower the ones you already posses, unlocking perks (special passive skills) requires you to befriend people (and creatures) around the town: the more you befriend, the sooner you get new perks. You can carry with you a single additional party member, choosing from the members of the main cast: each as his own abilities and special skills for you to use.The combat of South Park: The Stick of Truth doesn't differ that much from your typical turn-based RPG. In order to truly master it you'll have to get savvy about:- Defending yourself and dish out your attacks, which is done with button prompts- The status effect you can inflict upon your foes: burning, freezing, bleeding, screwed (dead in a certain number of turns) and grossed-out (a poisoned status that will sometimes prevent an enemy from acting), which are something vital to break someone's defense.The strongest suit of The Stick of Truth is of course is extreme adherence to the show itself, something that was helped by both Trey Parker and Matt Stone working on the project: the town of South Park you get to explore is extremely faithful, the graphic engine makes you feel like you are moving through an actual episode and the various characters react and talk as you'd expect them to. If you are a fan of the show you'll recognize several characters and places (some you'll even get to interact to) and appreciate how far this videogame goes, sometimes even beyond the show itself.Gameplay-wise, though, South Park: The Stick of Truth suffers from two significant shortcoming:1) For a roleplaying videogame, it can be beaten fairly quickly (between nine and ten hours, on an average), even considering the optional side quests and extra objective you can entertain yourself with. This however could be tied to the game shifting publiusher (from THQ to Ubisoft)2) The combat starts off as reasonable in difficulty, with no strong challenge curve progression afterwards, and becomes drammatically easy and mindless halfway through till the very end. This is due to the general generosity of the game when it comes to gear and weapons, the extremely low level cap (15), every class getting at the very least one or two abilities they can use to whipe the floor with even the largest pack of mooks and your health and mana being refilled completely after each fight.Still, South Park: The Stick of Truth is basically a must-have for the fan of the show proper and a very unique, solid, satyrical and entertaining turn-based roleplaying videogame for everyone else. Just don't come in and expect a very hard challenge"

This was a game that was sitting in my steam library for a bit over a year and i'm really glad i finally got around to giving it a shot. The turn-based fighting combat system was pretty good, and the interface was pretty well laid out and easy to use,My only 2 complaints about this whole game was the fact that i had to check a walkthrough about 4-5 times to figure out how to get to a certain area simply because it took me forever learning how to navagate some certain areas that you had to get to during the quests in this game, if some of the areas were a little better layed out for me, or atleast gave you hints of how to get to the next area after 5 minutes of struggling to do so, it would make this game near perfect.My other complaint was that it was a little too short in my opinion. According to steam, it took me only 17 hours to complete the game and all of it's side quests in its entirety (and that's while taking frequent breaks with the game still running). I was dissapointed to feel that a game i enjoyed so much was over in what seemed to be such a short amount of time, but hey, maybe that's just because time flies when you're having fun.If i had to rate this game, i would probably give it an even 9/10. Definitely one of the best buys you can get during a steam sale when its price is 50-75% off."
,Recommended,213670,23303860,"Posted: 30 May, 2016",all,ZCS| Nightmare,"First off, I am a huge South Park fan, so I'm bias.I thoroughly enjoyed this game and the RPG elements were pretty great. My 30 hours on record are from three different playthroughs, so take that into account. The game is short and, oh, how I wish it was longer! I hated extinguishing everything there was to do and going to the endgame.I would highly recommend this for any South Park fans and old-school rpg lovers. If you aren't a South Park fan, you most likely won't enjoy it either as much or at all. If you're easily offended by South Park, completely avoid it. It crosses the line on quite a few subjects, which I personally love dark and messed up humor. Lots of fart jokes, too, which are meh, but didn't ruin anything for me even though your Magic ability is basically fart types.Gameplay is solid. Lots of different weapons and customizations, though you'll be switching out equipment on a regular basis. Battle is turn-based, you'll almost always have one partner with their unique moves and abilities. You can switch between different characters in and out of battle, which is nice (though it takes up their turn when in battle). Difficulty, even on hard, is pretty easy when you have the option to use an item then attack/use magic.It's similar to Mario RPG (on SNES) with timed attacks for extra damage, so it's somewhat interactive though can be annoying.Story is great, though what few decisions you have, don't have much of an impact on the game and both decisions lead to the same outcome. It pretty much is just an interactive episode of South Park.If you like the looks of this game, but still on the fence, I'd say wait for a sale before getting it. You always have Steam refund options if you don't like it, which you should be able to figure out within the first hour or so of playing.My only complaint is that I wish it was longer and not so many timed button pressing events (I forgot the proper acronym and term for that)."

I liked watching the South Park shows and this game really made followed the series closely. Permanently missed out on Beetlebot, so I couldn't get complete the Chinpokomon quest.PROS1. Combat SystemSo simple yet so much more fun. Simple actions like mashing AD, WASD, W or clicking when the shiny light comes on makes combat slightly more fun. However, the fun kind of fades away when your abilities power up to ridiculous levels and you want to use the most powerful ones over and over again.2. StorySo odd, some scenes seem to remind me of people in real life. Despite the exaggeration of the cartoon, I have actually seen some real-life scenarios of what was shown in the game. E.g. 2-faced girls.3. PuzzlesThere are just so many. You don't have to kill monsters if you don't want to. You can just use the environment to kill them.4. Mini-gamesDancing Goth Game, Abortion Game, All the potential ""Sorry Australia"" mini-games, You could probably add all the mini-games from the Deponia series (Those are pretty good).CONS1. No MultiplayerI think that you could have created a 2-3 man questing system with a much bigger world with bosses. There are so many things from South Park that weren't shown. E.g. North Korea and the Dinosaur♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Stephen Hawking, Greenpeace.2. Repetitive SystemMonsters level up in the same way, i.e. more HP and more armour. Their attack patterns are basically the same. I was hoping for more variety.3. Missable QuestsIt's not really fun to know that there are quests that you have missed and can't return to. You don't really want to look at a guide and replay the whole game again."

It is not simply inspired bySouth Park, itisSouth Park. Watching the cut scenes is indistinguishable from watching the show itself, with all of the crude humour and profanity intact.You are the new kid who has just moved to town, and are tasked with fitting in and making friends in your neighbourhood. You are soon swept up into a war between humans and Elves over the Stick of Truth, which gives the wielder control of the universe. Of course, things escalate from there, and what starts as a mere children's game becomes entangled with a government plot to destroy the town.Fans of the series will love the plethora of characters and references to the show. The main cast is there, and can be controlled in combat as your one additional buddy, but even very minor characters make an appearance. All of the equipment and items you find also contain jokes and make it worth reading the descriptions. The amount of detail and careful attention paid to the cast body of work is staggering and appreciated.The game itself plays mostly like a JRPG reminiscent ofEarthbound, and the combat is lifted fromCostume Quest. You explore the town, with more of it accessible as you gain new powers, and battles are settled in a turn-based system that relies on timed button presses for attacking and defending. This keeps combat engaging and fast-paced, especially since you are never forced to grind. The one downside is you will probably find a few moves that work well and ignore the rest, especially the fart (magic) system.There is a large amount of equipment and a deep system of visual customization as well as weapon and armour modification. Unfortunately, if you complete most side quests and explore the town well, you will probably find most gear you find along the main quest is worthless, making those dozens of weapons and sets of armour just things to collect.The game itself is short for an RPG, but still quite long when compared to other genres. However, since there is no grind, the game's length is not padded out, making the whole experience enjoyable.The GoodLooks and feels exactly like aSouth ParkepisodeTons of references and cameos for fans of the seriesInteresting combat and progression systems with no grindThe BadSome combat options, like farts, have minimal useGear you find is often weaker than what you already haveNot particularly long for an RPGThe Bottom LineSouth Park: The Stick of Truthis a game every fan of the show should own, if only because it plays like a mini-series. However, there is a lot here for RPG fans, too, especially ones who enjoy a modern setting and games likeEarthboundandCostume Quest."

You will need to watch a series or two of the show if you want to understand some of the in-jokes. However, this doesn't stop it from being a good game.However, there are a couple of things that bother me, that also stop me from calling it an absolute masterpiece.Positives:-It feels like you are playing in a Southpark movie, were your character is the protagonist. It's all been very well designed.-Very funny! (If you like politically incorrect/dark/gross-out humour, you will love this!)-The characters are superb as always.-Simple to understand as an RPG. Very standard (choose you role, beat and loot enemies.).-Collecting is fun! There are all kinds of cool stuff to collect in the game.-It's creative! As a fantasy, D&D styled RPG, it's been made very creatively. Items that you collect are imaginative (weapons will consist of household items, alien weapons and much more!) and even some of the various levels are creative (I don't want to spoil them).-Lots of little side-quests that give you more than just the main story.-Story is fun, it's very out there. (As you should expect from Southpark).Negatives:PLEASE NOTE FIRST POINT BEFORE PURCHASING:-Some collectables are missable! There are some collectable items that you can only get during certain story missions and once you miss them, you will have to start a whole new playthrough to get a chance at them again. If you are an achievement hunter/perfectionsit like me, you may want to look up guides on the missable items in this game while playing.Also your current collected items can NOT be transfered to a new playthrough, unfortunately.-Most of the magic (fart) tutorials feel annoyingly difficult and aren't skippable. As far as I can see, they make it a lot harder than it turns out to be and they don't explain it very well. It's funny the first time, seeing as you need a tutorial telling you how to use your farts as a weapon, but it gets tedious.Score: 9/10"

I'm looking at doing a replay, because the graphical requirements are extremely low and I think it would be fun on my surface PRO (which runs it very well).  The humor is southpark quality, and unlike other crappy southpark games of the N64 era, this wans't outsourced.

The gameplay is a simple style of RPG gameplay, yet there is still room for tactical play.However, some quicktime sequences during the game can be overly difficult, and sometimes unclear as to what the player is expected to do. Plus, the classes don't offer a huge amount of variance in gameplay (no class-specific gear or the like), which can limit replayability.Overall, this game is a perfect adaptation for South Park and is well worth a purchase."

Can't tell you I'm still laughing.It's actually a really fun game, and a must play for any South Park fan.My only problem with the game is they decided to have mini games that you need to complete to continue. I can't say about on any platform other then the PC, but they can be very frustrating because they often rely on mashing keys on your key board. The ailen probe is a perfect example. Even with a reasonable KB it takes a lot of mashing, if your KB sucks you could be stuck there for a very long time. It also uses a check point save system, so if you decide to come back the next day to try a mini game again, you have to sit through it's entire cut scene. IMHO they should really give the cut scenes some sort of way to skip them.Other then that it's a great game with an interesting turn based combat system, and some pretty cool quests.

,Recommended,213670,33447042,Posted: 10 July,all,ＰＲ４ＩＺＥ,"The Stick of Truth is an oddity in that it's not only faithful to the material, but good too. You really couldn't ask for a better South Park game. It looks and sounds identical to the series, and is just as gleefully offensive. But it's also a very decent RPG, with rich customisation and slick turn-based combat.You are the new kid , and you've just moved to the not-so-sleepy Colorado mountain town of South Park with your parents. There are enough bits and pieces in the character creator to make a fairly accurate depiction of yourself, and I enjoyed seeing a little paper me sharing the screen with Cartman and co. in what is essentially an episode of the show. Don't worry about what name to enter when you're given the chance, though—everyone refers to you as '♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥' regardless.From the start, most of South Park is free to explore. Wandering its streets and plundering its houses, I was struck by how detailed it is. There are secrets, sight gags, and show references everywhere , and thorough exploration is rewarded with weapons, costumes, and other useful loot. It's a big space, and nearly every building can be entered, from Tom's Rhinoplasty and South Park Elementary, to the houses of all the main characters. The whole game is dense with jokes and Easter eggs, even down to the hundreds of sellable junk items. A lot of love has gone into designing the world.As you explore your new home you're drawn into a clash between the humans, led by grand wizard Cartman, and the elves, led by... well, I won't spoil the surprise. Cartman recruits you into his army and you're given a selection of classes to choose from: mage, fighter, thief, or jew. Yes, really. Each has its own special abilities, but there are no limits to what armour and weapons you can equip. The two factions are fighting over the titular Stick of Truth, a mystical artefact of great power that, according to the kids, allows the bearer to the control the Universe. But really it's just a stick.The writing is what you might expect from a South Park game. It's crass, it's satirical, and its parodies—of video games, RPGs, and high fantasy—are keenly observed. Nothing is out of bounds for Matt Stone and Trey Parker, and the game will no doubt stir some controversy. But that's why South Park exists, and I'd be disappointed if it didn't . The show has been ruffling feathers for almost 20 years and I'm glad the game hasn't pulled any punches. A few scenes in the PC version, including Randy Marsh being violated by♥♥♥♥♥♥probing aliens, are censored in certain regions, but they amount to a fraction of the game. I'd consider some of the stuff that wasn't cut to be more controversial.The war over the Stick gives way to a larger story involving a UFO, a government cover-up, and a virus that turns people (and kittens) into Nazis. But there are opportunities to stray from the story in the form of sidequests. You'll help Al Gore hunt down the elusive ManBearPig, fight Mongol warriors in the Tower of Peace, reunite Mr. Hankey with his missing kids, and dozens of other distractions involving characters from the show. A few are 'collect X things' filler, but most are entertaining and reasonably lengthy, with rewards including the ability to summon, among others, Jesus to help you in battle.The combat is where Obsidian's involvement becomes clear. They're the studio behind the likes of Fallout: New Vegas, Knights of the Old Republic II, and the forthcoming Pillars of Eternity, so they have some RPG chops, which is evident in South Park's excellent turn-based combat. There's genuine depth here, with status effects, damage modifiers, stances, buffs, debuffs, and customisable gear. It's most reminiscent of the Final Fantasy games, but with a South Park twist. Fling a turd at an enemy and you'll inflict 'grossed out' status, causing them to keel over and puke, while red-headed enemies' 'Touch of the Ginger' ability lowers your defence. It's snappy, fast-paced, and requires some strategic thinking, but bar a few bosses, it can be a little too forgiving on the default difficulty setting.Real-time elements give the combat some added flavour. You can block by hitting the right mouse button just as an enemy attacks, and most spells and abilities involve some kind of player input to pull off properly, usually in the form of simple, unintrusive minigames. To use Jimmy's bardic powers, performed with his magical lute, you have to complete a short rhythm-action sequence, while the new kid's fart powers (think Skyrim's dragon shouts, but funnier) are timing-based. These make combat feel more hands-on and dynamic than your average turn-based game.There's a lot of gear in the game, which greatly expands your ability to customise your character and comes with interesting buffs and modifiers. Combined with 'strap-ons', which add additional effects to weapons and armour, this gives you scope to make some unique character builds. As you face enemies with different strengths and weaknesses, you'll find yourself regularly changing costumes to adapt. Much of the fun in the game—that is, the RPG beneath all the jokes and pop culture references—lies in experimenting with the vast array of gear and strap-ons you find as you play. This might be the first time in PC Gamer history where the word 'strap-on' has appeared three times in a paragraph.The problem with reviewing The Stick of Truth is that I can't really talk about my favourite bits. Being surprised is half the experience, and you won't believe some of the stuff it makes you do. I had to stop myself calling people over to my monitor in the office to see whatever ludicrous thing was happening next. It's one of the most unpredictable, and consistently entertaining, games I've played, which is all the more impressive when you realise that the only reused assets are enemies. Every scene is handcrafted and animated, which is remarkable for a game that lasts between 15-20 hours. The summons and late game special attacks, including one where Cartman overloads his V-chip by repeatedly swearing, are a joy to watch. They've somehow made the famously low-fi South Park feel lavish .And I laughed. A lot. It's puerile, yes, but not in the dimwitted way the execrable Family Guy game was. South Park's humour has always felt very knowing to me, with its tongue wedged firmly in its bum cheeks. The show marries schoolboy fart jokes with dark, witty satire, and the game is no different. It also manages to steer almost entirely clear of the trap a lot of comedy games fall into, where they joke about something while actively making you do it. See Far Cry 3 spin-off Blood Dragon mocking boring tutorials while making you sit through a boring tutorial for a recent example. The comedy here is never at the expense of fun, even when it's poking fun at gaming cliches.There are better RPGs out there, but no one's buying The Stick of Truth just for that. You'll probably buy it because you like, or at least are familiar with, South Park, and as an extension of that series it's pretty much perfect. That it's a decent game underneath it all too is a pleasant bonus. Above all, it's just a wonderful piece of entertainment. It's surprising, surreal, packed with jokes, and rarely frustrating. I didn't get bored once across the 17 hours it took me to finish the story and most of the sidequests, and it kept me laughing consistently until the credits. If that isn't worth 90%, I don't know what is."

I do not really like South Park all that much, though this game has kind of made me appreciate it a bit more. I really wanted to play this game for a while, and when it went on the steam sale I had to pick it up just because I had a big RPG itch that needed scratching. I wasn't disappointed. I completed the 11-12 hour game in about two days, being completely hooked. The game is filled with humor poking fun at video games and culture in general. Graphically speaking it looks identical to the TV show and your character fits in extremely well, while being a silent protagonist(which leads to some very funny jokes). I can't believe how much I laughed at a game based off a show I never really cared for. This game is a MUST buy for RPG fans even if you don't like South Park I'd say. Unless you're TOTALLY against the idea of South Park.Alright Pros and Cons time.Pros:+Looks visually identical to the TV show+Hilarious+Really fun timed battle system+Does not hold back on the rudness and crudeness of the show(may be a con to some, though I felt it was MOSTLY a strength)+Tons of collectables and interactions+Feels like an entire season of South Park starring you+have to add another pro saying again how hilarious the game isCons:-Some flickering graphical bugs that were easily fixed by restarting the game, but still something to look out for-Incredibly easy, I only died once in my whole playthrough-Only able to use one other party member-Maximum level is only 15 as far as I can tell (in general I think the combat system is great, but the damage and levels and party members should be revamped if they ever do a sequel)TL;DREven if you aren't a South Park fan, or even dislike it, there is still a lot to like here.

The writing and humor are top notch; if you like South Park, this won't disappoint. There are references stretching back all the way to the first season, from songs that play on radios to the stuffed Scuzzlebutt in Jimbo's gun shop. And since this was developed by Obsidian, the combat is surprisingly good. It's your standard turn-based battle system, but it has a real-time block/parry system, and some of the status ailments are truly hilarious. Want to make your enemy skip their turns? Throw that turd you fished out of the toilet at them and they'll be too busy throwing up.The only downside, if you can call it that is that the game is relatively short, clocking in at around 15 hours (I clocked 20 on my first playthrough), give or take a few depending on how many sidequests you do. Naturally sidequests will tack on some extra hours, and if you're a South Park fan, you'll want to explore everything you can regardless, just to see everything you can (like walking around Mr. Slave's bedroom). And to collect all the Chinpokomon. But considering the quality of the game, it's more like paying $60 for an interactive season of South Park than just an ordinary game.If you like South Park, you'll like this game, end of story."

The comments suggest there is too little content and it is too short. I feel this is an apple to oranges comparsion since the content in this game is highly polished with high quality voice acting and side quests that are interesting and entertaining. I would much prefer that to 100 hours of fetch quests and tedious travelling that seem to serve no purpose other than to drag the game out.

76561198031956651,Recommended,213670,10238576,"Posted: 26 May, 2014",all,pooperpirate,"This is possibly the first game based off a TV show that I actually love. If you are an avid fan of South Park you would be committing an atrocity if you did not buy this game. Even better is if you are a lover of RPGs due to how this game pokes fun at the genre and is an RPG itself. If you are not a fan of South Park I would be cautious about buying this as the game makes lots of funny references to the actual show (even the show's main characters have closets which are dedicated to their previous adventures).The big reason it's a must recommend for fans of the show though, is how it feels like a true South Park experience. The whole game plays out like an entire season of the show, with you as the main character. Exploring the town of South Park is a blast. You can go to explore familiar locations from the show and find collectables that are actually WORTH collecting, mainly friends. You can also do some side missions, one includes finding jesus. This brings me to the cast of the game. You see a lot of familiar faces from South Park and even some really minor characters only seen in one or two episodes such as Damien or the satan worshiping forest animals. Every main character's house is explorable and almost all major locations in the show are present and accounted for.Now how does the gameplay fare? Really well actually. South Park does a lot of things right with the RPG and combat portion of things. First off is that every move you perform requires you to a button prompt of some sort (such as mashing a and d) that can boost your damage or in some more extreme moves, prevent you from self-injury while attacking with said move. Each class and the buddies have their own unique style of moves, each of which are fun to watch being performed. Some of my favorites are Cartman's V-chip, Professor Chaos, and Pestilence for the Jew class (yes there is a Jew class, suprised me as well and made me fall out of my chair). The game also allows you to bypass some fights by using the environment to KO your enemies before engaging. As per RPGs you gain exp which allows you to level abilities, and for every friend list milestone you make you get a perk. You also can perform magic by farting. You get four spells, each of which can be used in battle and out. As mentioned before you get a selection of 6 companions to fight with you in combat, and can select from 4 classes to play as. All of them have their own unique skillset and all of them have unique dialogue when exploring certain areas. In the case of classes you can still play any play style you want. Mages can focus on melee damage, thieves can focus on armor, ect. ect. The only difference between them are what abilities you get, and what default gear you have. Then there are the summons, four of them, all of them ending a battle instantly (save for bosses, because as Jesus puts it: they are scary), all of them entertaining. You can also ""mod"" your equipment by adding patches to them which can give things like bleeding or armor piercing.Really my only complaint is that the game is WAY EASY even on the hardest difficulty. Play this game on hardcore otherwise you will zomgwtfbbqpwn everything in your path (which you actually will still do in hardcore). Adding into this is the seemingly endless amount of potions that you most likely will never use (even revive potions, which should always be hard to acquire). Also there is no reason to play the other classes as they all play out pretty much the same, severly detracting from replay value (I still did multiple playthroughs as there were two major choices in the game I wanted to try out for the opposite side, plus the character dialogue). These gripes however are easily overshadowed by the decent-to-great RPG gameplay.Overall this is possibly the GREATEST South Park game ever, and easily one of the best licensed titles. The gameplay is done pretty well but could have used some tweaks like difficulty.  If you are a fan of the show and don't have this game, please, just come out of the closet and buy it. If not then I cannot recommend this at it's current price tag. I would still buy it when it goes on sale though. Now if you'll excuse me I'm gonna go fart on every thing in this game.tl;dr:Great game, buy if you are a fan of the show, buy if you like RPGs a lot. Do not buy if easily offended. Only major issue is game is too easy."

The game is full of surprises and features a lot of insider jokes for South Park connoisseurs.But even if you are not a South Park fan you may enjoy this brilliantly crafted RPG. The combat system is similiar to the Mario & Luigi RPG series that you may know from Nintendo DS and 3DS. The Stick of Truth features an open world, cool locations, intense battles, a nice but very compact skill system, great videosequences, a good and lighthearted story, lots of crude humor and great satire. It's not a very complex or ""deep"" role-playing game but the mechanics are well done and there is a lot to discover and to do. Even though it is not very ""deep"", it's not a ""casual game"" and the boss fights can be very challenging.Two things I didn't like about this game: I found it a bit short (finished the story after 14 hours) and there are missable collectibles (and I hate it when you cannot go back to get something you missed!)I recommend this game to any South Park fan or anyone who thinks he might enjoy a South Park themed-RPG. If you do not like South Park or if you dislike the Mario & Luigi combat system, this game is not for you."

This game yes, took me 17 hours to complete, which all in all is pretty good for 60 buks, BUT, there is little to no replay value of this game. There is only 2 ways you could maybe play this game again for 'different content'.1. There are some points in the game where you get to make a decision about which team you join, BUT, the overall outcome of the game is not altered. It is basically one boss fight difference.2. You could go play the other three classes you didnt select in the first place but really? would you want to play the game again for another 17 hours with basically the same content but 5 different spells interchanging for the ones that you have currently? no.Other than this i think this game is a very good attempt of making a game which feels as if you were in an episode and that you were making that episodes content. So all in all. Good game. Just dont buy it until its atleast 40 bucks as it is so not worth the 60 dollar price tag :)"

South Park the TSOT is a 2D open world RPG game with rewarding exploration and good sense of humor .The world of South Park is captured perfectly . There are momentos from each southpark esisode scatered around. If you like me and have been followign South Park from espisode 1 you will get a lot of nostalgia . All of the loveble characters are here voice acted by the creators so its almost like watching a very long South Park episode .You can pretty much access each house or establishment in South Park city that appeared in the show and loot it .There are 4 classes you can play each with uniqe skills and upgrades so game has decent replay value .Perhaps the most imporant thing is the variety of skills and weapons at your disposal ranging from thrawing crap to using katanas . Combat in game requirs you to constatly hit timed window which makes it more fun than average turn based combat . Unfortunetly game may be a little too easy so I would recommend bumping difficulty to hardcore after level 3 .I don't know if this game would be enjoyable for someone who haven't seen the show very often but for those people who have its a great tribute to South Park legacy .

76561198044192744,Recommended,213670,11683772,"Posted: 12 August, 2014",all,Red Out,"South Park: The Stick of Truth is an rpg that has more of a Final Fantasy style of combat to it. But its not that at all what makes this game fun to play. Its ultimately the humor and the story that kept me playing.The game starts out where all the kids are playing an rpg (This is also a follow up of the Black Friday episode), Cartman's humans vs Kyle's Droll elves, and they are all pretending to war against eachother for a stick they call the Stick of Truth. Its rather entertaining how much detail they go into on their made up world of Zaron, from Jimmy's house being made into a bar, to Kyle and Cartman's houses being the center point of their kingdoms.But of coarse, South Park being South Park, the game's story gets even more crazy and random, from nazi zombies to a government agency pretending to be Taco Bell.At the begining of the game you create your character, and there is quite a wide variety of hair styles and hair colors, though skin tone choices are sadly low, and you can't choose your gender either, sorry gals but you have to play as a boy. After making your character, you start in you're home in South Park, I won't say anymore to avoid spoliers, but just to let you know as part of the humor in the game, you're character does not say anything. You eventually get the choice of you're class, Fighter, Mage, Theif or Jew (Only South Park). All of them are unique in their moves and default armor. Unfortunatly, perks don't change by what class you choose, they are always the same which kinda hurts this game in replay value.At some point later in the game you choose wether to join Cartman or Kyle's side, though I feel this should have been placed in the begining of the game, regardless, your choice only effects who you fight in the story line, either way both human and elf vendors will be available. At least you either get Stans sword or Butters hammer depending on the side you choose.Sadly you are only aloud 1 buddy in combat, and there are only 6 buddies in total, but for the most part they are all useful, however, you will use Butters more often just for his professor chaos ability. It pops up at level 6 which doesn't really take long to get too. The game for the most part is really easy and Butters just makes it even easier past level 6, though later in the game there is a big difficulty spike. However I found out the reason why, is beacause enemies have their armor massively increased. This is really no problem since all you have to do is spam your armor shreading abilities.Despite how much I love playing this game, my biggest pet peeve with this game is that it plays way to similar to Final Fantasy, by that I mean you level by just playing through the game (Levels have little influence since enemies get harder eveytime you level), levels just simply unlock better weapons and moves.You can also get plastic surgery to turn your face into David Hasselhoff.Now this won't effect the game's score but its still worth mentioning to potential buyers.WARNING: THIS GAME TAKES M RATING TO THE MAX.This game is borderline adult rating, since this is South Park there is a lot of humor in here that some may find disturbing (And thats putting it in a nice way).There are jokes about, abortion, homosexuality, sex and crude humor (You can attack using farts).Not to metion this game is a gore fest with strong langauge.To simply put it. Not the kind of game to be playing in front of anyone unless maybe they are a South Park fan too.But even then this game can make you cringe as well, especially that last part with Mr. Slave, geez.My score is an 8/10"

The overly-sensitive need-not-apply. This game attempts to offend absolutely everyone. If you don't like South Park, you won't like this game.The Stick of Truth is a simple turn-based RPG. Some abilities and sequences require QTEs, but they are all very easy. The gameplay is very similar to Super Mario RPG on SNES. Pressing a button while defending will reduce damage. Pressing a button while attacking will increase damage. Of course, these buttons must be pressed at the right time, or you'll just make things worse.You play a new resident of South Park. Another young boy that lives on the same street as main cast. Stan, Kyle, Kenny, Cartman, Butters and Jimmy are all playable. Nearly every South Park character makes an appearance, or is referenced in some way.The game is riddled with ""junk"" items. (Much like those commonly found in World of Warcraft and the like.) You can't do anything with them but store them or sell. Nearly all of them are ""easter-eggs"" which reference the South Park series in some way. For example, you can find a ""Where has my country gone?"" CD.The music stays very true to the South Park series. It even incorporates the short tune that would accompany the start of the show, or a return from commercials. In small areas here and there, you will find other music from the show.If you are a fan of South Park, you will probably enjoy this game. It is very easy though. The enjoyment of the game comes primarily from the story. There is a lot of story here. A ton of jokes. At least a movie's worth.Addendum: Why it's too easy.The ally characters each have an ability that can be used, for free, in addition to their other action. Butters' ability is game-breaking. He pats you on the back 3 times in-a-row. This heals health each time. There are item-mods and perks which take effect each time you are healed. (Such as restoring more health or gaining PP.) So you could be healed to full, and restore enough PP to use your ultimate ability... EVERY TURN.Items are too potent. Even without considering equipment-mods or perks. The restorative items give way too much health, and you can carry around 50 minor heals and 50 major. Then 10 ""ressurection"" items too. It wouldn't be so bad if you didn't find them every 2 steps. There are so many, I sell them off to buy equipment, andstillhave plenty left-over.Allies can heal all HP/PP to full by switching. They can even use their free-action first.Abilities are too powerful in late-game. Even your basic ability can kill every enemy before they can act.The speed potion is cheap and plentiful. It allows you to take 2 actions instead of one. Your ally can use it too. This can easily overwhelm most enemies."

That first person shooter with the pee snow balls, the  racing game I never played and a quiz game show hosted by Chef?This isn't like any of those. It's an RPG, and its the best venue for South Park to do what South Park does best. It truly feels like an episode or the movie. However, you don't have to be a fan of the show to keep up.This game is a new, self contained story from the creators of the show. And God damn does it show! The writing is sharp and will have you giggling on a scale from one to ♥♥♥♥in hilarious! But its still an RPG, which this game doesn't forget. Matt Stone and Trey Parker are big fans of RPGs, and Obsidian was first on their list. That also shows. It plays like a really good RPG. like a really good, like, Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars good. Remember that game? Yeah you do. It's good right? Well, this is pretty much that plus toilet humor.The battles play out much like Super Mario RPG. It's turn based and you can use one item in addition to your attack. When attacking or defending, you are prompted with a timed button press or a wiggle of the analog. A successfully timed wiggle will grant you more or less damage depending. You gain various summon characters and abilities based on your class as you level up.To say the least, the battles are engaging and the game doesn't really drag much. Even when traveling though the rural town of South Park, you gain different abilities to access various secrets. You can talk to pretty much every character from the show, and some of them provide side quests for you, in addition to the main story line. There's plenty to do in the town of South Park and you can get tangled up in quests for hours. That's not a bad thing. Aside from potentially lost comedy, completing each quest will provide you with gear and abilities to help you with your journey.Either way you look at it, this game is solid. It had me wanting to see what what was waiting for me when I started the next morning. This game was constantly surprising me as I progressed further and had me giggling with my stupid refection in the monitor while it was loading. I recommend this game, as either and fan of the show or RPGs. I have a feeling there might already be a lot of cross over. You can wait for it to go on sale, but if you're on the fence about it, just get it. It's pretty fun, man."

Well this is a Real Big Title Videogame by far. The comedy is amazing and the way the charaters act and move around makes you feel like you are really just watching South Park. The RPG elements are really good too and some battles and bosses are suprisingly tough. There seems to be an endless amount of weapons, armor,  and upgrades and the world is filled with familiar environments and characters. Overall South Park: The Stick of Truth is a real RPG and a really good game that feels whole yet still has the elements from the show we know and love."

Alright, maybe not, but if you're a South Park fan you'll absolutely love all the fan service this game offers.  This game is loaded with references to jokes from all seasons past, and cameo after cameo of your favorite south park citizens.I didn't expect much from the combat in this game as I'm not a huge fan or supporter of Quick Time Events (QTE).  However, the combat is also filled with it's own hilarity as you discover your special attacks and try each of your South Park friends abilities in battle.  I just loved the makeshift style of the spells and weapons and armor.  They all felt like a South Parks kid representation.  I played a mage and lol'd when I cast my first lighting bolt spell, which was a bucket of water and a car battery.If you enjoy the show, you'll enjoy playing this game.  It's like watching a 20 hour south park movie.  If you don't want to play it, well...Screw you guys.  I'm going home."

It's really great :) There was one or two moments where I laughed and I smiled the rest of it. Combat is too easy, but on the maximum difficulty it is still enyojable (treat Normal as Very Easy, and highest as Easy).The game really does feel like a series of episodes and it should be all the recommendation that it needs.The only thing that can get bad, are occasional glitches - invisible characters or characters in and out of combat. That happens fairly rarely, although it seems the game does not like alt tabbing too much (as in - at all).The main story is really great, and takes you through most of things that ever happened in south park, and throws in some. It is fairly short, but it does not get boring. I'd give it an 8/10 or 9/10 if you are a huge SP fan. It felt refreshing."

As someone who grew up with Paper Mario and likes the South Park show, this one resonates with me.  It's basically a parody of RPGs...  South Park style!  You get to join Stan's quiet little mountain town as the new kid and meet new ""friends"" as you participate in a Fantasy game that seems to have everyone involved!  It parodizes everything from the turn-based battle system in general, to invisible roadblocks and everything we grew up around in these games.  It's not just a parody, it's a strong RPG on it's own with minigames, an actual plot and interactions with your surroundings for hilarious results.  Obviously, this is South Park, so it's not for everyone.  Let's compare South Park to Picasso.  For most, it's random and a mess, but for those who see it for what it is, it's basically art.  I know, I just called South Park art.  Go with me on this one.  It's one hell of a game filled to the brink with offensive yet hilarious comedy and charm, only brought down by a rather complex menu system and a slightly repetitive battle system.  But it's all good, it's unbelievavly entertaining to watch.  South Park is one of the best RPGs in recent memory.  It brings back fond memories of Paper Mario as a kid and is basically a super long South Park episode.  If you like the show, this is definetly a buyer.9.7/10"
,Recommended,213670,9349508,"Posted: 4 March, 2014",all,Krobelux,This game is great! You can tell Matt and Trey put a lot of effort into making this game feel like the show. The comedic timing is on par with the TV series and the battle system is reminiscent of earlier RPGs such as Super Mario RPG and Paper Mario. Very simplistic yet challenging nonetheless.Highly recommended for those who are fans of turn based RPGs and South Park. This is without a doubt their finest game to date.

As a big fan of South Park this felt like playing a interactive movie length South Park episode with loads of laughs. The turn based combat system works well for this game as it adds a tactical element to the game and isn't just another ""spam the attack button"" game. It is definitely a game that i believe many would play again just to relive the witty humour that is in this game, and for that reason this game is a must have for any South Park fan and for anyody who is slightly interested in it!"

,Recommended,213670,10200539,"Posted: 22 May, 2014",all,LoneGreyWolf,"South Park: The Stick of Truth *NON Spoiler review*The Stick of Truth is a very entertaining game, with around 12-16 hours of gameplay including the sidequests, the storyline is nothing far from what we would expect from South Park, from having a very comic, random but enjoyable storyline. With gems from most episodes of the TV Show itself ranging from the very first pilot episode towards the later Black Friday episodes.Throughout the game you will be meeting our favorite characters from the four boys, Stan, Kyle, Cartman and Kenny to Butters, Jimmy, Craig, Clyde and many others! The dialogue within the game will split your sides with laughter most of the time, either it be from actual character to character interaction or be it on the quest journal, or as we would see it, “Facebook”.As you journey in your epic quest for the Stick of Truth adding the many characters of South Park to your friends list to either unlock achievements or even for a quest, but it doesn't stop there, it just isn’t for the looks either, it also has its perks what can also upgrade your character, allowing certain damage/resources/resistance modifiers to your character.The combat system within the game, is a very smooth style of combat, at first glance wouldnt seem to fit in a South Park game, but once you get started in the game, it feels very natural.Pros of the game;> Original content and dialogue> Fresh intake into the world of RPGs> A good amount of customization, what effects dialogue and interaction with characters.> Many hidden gems/easter eggs to the TV show what you will find a nice little laugh if you remember the episode.> Controls and interaction are very simple to use with an informative tutorial at the start of the game.Cons of the game;> Once you have completed the game once, the feeling of replayability goes out the window, due to the story being the same each time you would play. Despite what class you would play.> The difficulty in the game even on the hardest setting isn’t deeply challenging, all but par some boss fights.> No end game content, now for me in the end of an RPG once you are done with the main storyline I always feel there could be something else to do, whether it be exploring or finishing up side quests, but there is a lack of side quests and you will most likely finish them during the main storyline.In summary, even though the game is fairly short for its price, I personally felt it was worth to pay that little extra for hilarious content what was provided.without a doubt and even with some of the minor cons of the game, I felt it was a good investment into buying the game.I would recommend this game for any South Park fan, as I feel you would only have to be a SP fan to understand all the witty lines and items ingame to get the maximum enjoyment.Thanks for reading."

I can't stress enough how quality it is overall, a game based on a tv show is seldom (quite possibly never before) created with this much potential realized. The sense of humor is on par with the best the show has to offer. They reference tons of subtle stuff from the show, from junk to sell like Token's bass guitar or the Intellilink Manual, to stuff like collectible Chinpokomon.Customization is done well, as is pretty much everything else. It isn't censored or watered down. So far my only complaint is the small party size, although you can switch out ""buddies"" during combat.  I highly suggest getting this if you are a fan of the show or have a sense of humor. If you are easily offended or have kids within earshot... pick it up anyway, develop a sense of humor and send your younglings to their grandparent's house for a week. 9.8/10"

I have never gone more than five minutes without either laughing or being simply delighted by one moment or another.Not being able to rebind the keys is stupid, of course, and I really do not much care for Japanese-style role-playing games, but the fact that I am still whole-heartedly endorsing this game despite those issues goes to show how high-quality it is.

It's a turn-based action RPG with some point&click adventure elements. The game runs perfectly fluidly with almost no load times at all (unlike the console versions *wink*). If you are a fan of South Park, and a fan of Butter's Creamy Goo, you will appreciate this game which explodes with callbacks and hilarity at every turn. I'm being super serial right now you guys."

I didn't 100% it, but I DID do all the quests, level up to 15, and get enough friends to max out my Perks. Game is incredibly short and easy. By the end of the game I was just spamming special attacks that hit all enemies to finish normal fights in one round. Against bosses, I could just lob out the Broken Bottle with a Fire damage strap-on to inflict enough negative status effect to just watch bosses die to stacked Bleed/Gross Out/Burning damage. Why bother Stunning enemies when you can just kill them all?Overall, I'd give the game a 7/10 ONLY if you're already a South Park fan. If you've never watched the show before, this game is a mediocre 4/10 at best. I simply can't rate such a short, easy game higher than that. That Ubisoft had the balls to try to charge $60 retail for it amazes me. I'd be kicking myself if I paid full price for it. As it is, I feel like I should have got it from Gamefly or something rather than buy it even on sale.TL;DR version: Rent it for a weekend and you can probably finish it with ease."

This will always be a memorable treasure in my library.----------------------------------***SPOILER ALERT***------------------------------------------So, You arrive in a quiet little mountain town in northern Colorado and end up playing wizards and warriors with a bunch of local kids who are divided into two sides fighting for a legendary twig said to hold the power to command the very fabric of reality, but that night aliens capture you and try to anally probe you. But because you have incredible♥♥♥♥♥powers and are able to fart like a legend, you manage to absorb a piece of the probe which gives you the ability to teleport. Then you Mr. Marsh break out and you manage to take out the pilots, which crashes the alien space ship into south park. Alien slime from this crash turns living organisms into undead members of the German national socialist party from WWII. You continue playing wizards and warriors, making more and more friends as you go, including satanic woodland creatures, a Chinese chef, the son of god, little underpants stealing creatures that give you the power to shrink and grow, and of course, a festive piece of feces.  You have to enlist the help of the girls who sent you to investigate one of them being at an abortion clinic, and as it turned out, the files of that girl were in french, so you have to go to Canada which is having political problems of it's own. All this time you've been channeling and mastering your farts to do more powerful things, such as release at a certain time, go further, and of course do basic damage. So the two masters of farting teach you how to blast through solid objects, which allows you to rescue the one guy in Canada who can translate the documents into English. Through this you find out that the government plans to destroy the Nazi zombies by blowing up all of south park by putting a nuclear bomb inside a gay man's♥♥♥♥♥Trey Parker and Matt Stone... you two are something else."

The over the top lines and jokes that make fun of current events and everything else in the world are great! This game looks exactly like you're in the tv show. You get to create your own character and play through a skyrim meets game of thrones world with all of that southpark humor we know thrown in. Great writing, and all of the companions and characters throughout the game make hilarious comments as you play. I love the combat system, it's turn based but throws in mouse clicks for blocking and extra attacks as well as button mashing and random key pressing for special abilities (keeps the combat kind of fresh rather than just taking a turn). I love the story line as well, it is new and inventive while at the same time making fun of other common story lines in todays games and tv shows. The stick of truth is one of the few games where I actually want to find all the secrets and earn all the achievements where it doesnt feel like a chore or get boring, and it has tons of replayability. My only small dislikes are how short it is for an RPG (roughly 12-15 hours for me) I just wish there could be more or at least a DLC. I also dislike how there are only four classes to choose from.

There are plenty of hilarious references to the show that help the player to immerse himself/herself in this interactive episode (as some other more famous reviewer referred to it).Concerning the gameplay, it is nothing too innovative, its a classic JRPG (japan role playing game) combat system with some quick time events (not too different than final fantasy 8 if i recall correctly). Nevertheless the combat is entertaining and rarely boring, this combat system does the job nicely.Technically the game is extremely well done. Graphically it looks like watching an episode of the series and I have encountered no bugs during my playthrough, except maybe a very minor flaw (beware, minor spoiler):You can summon Mr. Slave to help you in a fight from inside his butt.One of the things that the game is definitely lacking is replayability, since once one has finished the main story and the side quests there is not much else to do and replaying the whole game with a different class would most probably dont influence the story itself.Concluding, if you are a fan of the show, then this is a MUST buy for you. However if you are interested in a relaxed well polished rpg with tons of politically incorrect humor, then this may be the game for you."

Yahtzee's review comparing this to Paper Mario is pretty spot on.It's an RPG, simple to learn, easy to master, almost too easy. I cranked the difficulty up to hardcore knowing it was an easy game and it STILL provided only a mediocre amount of challenge if only because I was playing to maximize the amount of achievements I got in a playthrough. But I suppose it is nice to do that because then subsequent playthroughs are faster and easier. Seriously you can attach upgrades to weapons and armor and remove them at will with no penalty, it's very easy to become OP and makes combat trivial and time consuming (which I guess is why the main story almost entirely consists of Paper Mario style dungeons where you want to use the environment to instakill enemies in interesting ways to skip past combat).Mechanically the game has different status conditions (stunned, asleep, grossed out, on fire, and bleeding) but given how bosses are immune to stun, sleep, and grossed out, not to mention a more frequently recurring enemy 'type' that's always immune to grossed out it can be very easy to accidentally gimp your character (offset by the game's ease, I guess). Respec-ing doesn't exist so yeah, have a plan for a character.Plotwise it's solid (for South Park) right up until the end. No, seriously, you will know the point at which Matt Stone walked into the dev team's room and said ""Alright, gimme what you got cuz we're releasing this tomorrow."" But the stuff before the ending is really good. Without spoiling, they effectively recorded voices for multiple characters for every scenario, placing bits from the show in at all kinds of points to really make it worthwhile to explore.Overall pick this up while it's on a 66% sale. I did and I got a lot out of the game (3 playthroughs worth of entertainment). Just be aware that this game does have missables, and missables make you playthrough again to get achievements."

Really really good game. An awesome game!I don't know how people who are not familiar with South Park cartoon (wut?) or who don't like it (wut?wut?WUT?!!) could treat it, but this game is absolutely must have for every fan of SP. It is like watching the movie, being part of it and playing the game at the same time. Game has references to almost all characters and episodes, classic SP humor and 100% authentic ridiculous story line. Being a part of the South Park doesn't mean that you are playing one of the characters. Nope. You'll be the New Kid. Others kids will threat you like a new kid, rip on you as they always do, and you'll have your unique (ridiculous and fun) background story. This is amazing.Tbh I was expecting everything that I said above. What I didn't expected is that The Stick of Truth is an interesting to play. I mean from the gamer perspective, not just from movie watcher. Game is not like watching scripted scenes and pressing 'E' from time to time. You have to play it. You have to learn how to play it. Damn, you even have to learn how to fart! Because failing to do a perfect fart when it's needed may result of your defeat in the combat. Yes, fights are primitive and ridiculous, but that's what South Park is about, isn't it?..10/10"

The game takes about 14-16 hours to beat, but I wish there was even more. The post-game is ok, you have a few side-quests to complete but that's it. The post-game takes about 1-2 hours to complete. This game also offers you collectables, Chinpokemon, for you to find around the map by doing puzzles. If you haven't watched South Park, I recommend watching a few episodes before you start the game.In conclusion, South Park: The Stick of Truth is one of the best RPG's I have ever played, now that's saying something. It has great humor, wonderful graphics, and the game makes you think you are actually INSIDE a South Park episode. I give this game a solid 10/10."

,Recommended,213670,12886794,"Posted: 11 November, 2014",all,Blunderhorse,"It's basically Paper Mario by Trey Parker and Matt Stone, which is a great thing.  Much like Paper Mario, the combat is simple, but keeps you engaged by requiring timed actions for your abilities to be effective.  The only downside I will give the game is that if you have any experience with RPGs or even basic strategy it is very easy to break the combat system, making fights incredibly easy: for example, modifying your armor so your abilities can restore more PP than they use, modifying multi-hit weapons to inflict a status effect that stacks, etc.  Luckily, the game is about playing through and enjoying all of the little jokes they threw in, and how you handle combat will not interfere with that.  If you're interested enough to be reading the reviews, then you probably enjoy South Park enough that you should get the game.  Just remember that they're taking full advantage of everything they can get away with that wouldn't go over so well on television."

Its story, script and art style are all true to the show, unsurprising seeing as how the game was written and directed by South Park creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone.It is obvious that Obsidian Entertainment have played a lot of Paper Mario. Everything in this game, from the timing-spiced turn-based combat system to the battle companions to the interactive world navigation to the equipment upgrades to the cutting injokes about the game itself all bear the halmarks of Intelligent Systems' Mario RPGs. Replace the South Park characters with Mario characters and clean up the filth and this could be a Paper Mario game.The story sparkles with political satire, unashamedly coarse humour and enough references to make fanboys giggle like lunatics. The script, as well as the art style and animation, make the player feel like they are a part of the show. Games such as Skyrim are made fun of to rib-tickling effect, and the story itself could easily be a story arc in the show.As a fan of RPGs, I appreciated all the injokes poking fun at RPG staples, such as turn-based battles, Power Points, world exploration and boss battles. These injokes would seem obnoxious if the game was rubbish (it has happened before), but South Park: The Stick of Truth is really fun to play. Taking cues from Paper Mario, your attacks in battle can be powered up with well-timed mouse clicks and keyboard inputs, and you are supported in battle by one of five potential 'buddies', each with their own special attacks. The timing-based attack system means that the combat rarely gets boring, to the point where I actively sought out battles for the fun of it. I found a certain buddy to be somewhat overpowered compared to the others, but this is a very minor criticism.The sound design is also very good in this game. The music is exceptional, and the audio feedback from attacking and defending is very pleasing. The buddy characters' voice samples, performed by Parker and Stone, are also very entertaining, as they react authentically to the things you do (mostly your farts).Some have questioned the pricetag of this game, arguing that $60, or your regional equivalent, is too much for a game that lasts ""only"" about 15 hours. Personally, I hate this mindset. I agree with Totalbiscuit that the games we get these days ought to cost upwards of $100 (or your... oh, you get the idea) on launch, and we are incredibly lucky to get them at the prices we do. I got this game for £40 and loved every minute of it, so I feel that it was worth the money. I can not deny that the cost may seem unjustifiable to some, so you should take that into consideration if you are looking to purchase this game. If you are really bothered by it, wait for the game to go on sale. Also, I encountered a strange bug that sometimes caused my game and sound to start stuttering when I loaded my save file, This fixed itself after several relaunches, but it was annoying when it did happen. I do not know what caused the stuttering, but you should be wary of it.Overall, South Park: The Stick of Truth is a highly enjoyable game with few flaws. It may seem too easy for  its demographic but if you are looking for an authentic South Park gaming experience, look no further than this game. Go forth, young warrior, on your quest to become... cool.Good Points:Excellent story, script and soundEnjoyable, addictive combat systemFlexible equipment and upgrade system allowing you to tailor your character to suit your play stylePlenty of fun side quests to fill in the timeA goldmine of referencesAs authentic a South Park experience as you can getBad Points:A little too easy for RPG veteransAn annoying, unexplained bug that occasionally causes the game to stutter upon loadingA certain Jew is a little overpoweredCould have been longer (that's what she said)May seem too expensive for someRedWolf Rating: 7/10"

The story, jokes, and world is not just a one sided gag of just TV episode humor or their usual Upbeat humor on what's going on today. The combat system isn't that bad either. With just a few flaws with input timing and the notion of not defending on turns, the combat while interesting is lack luster even on hardcore. I only died 3 times during the whole game and that was during one boss fight that was a lot higher than me. but even being put at a disadvantage for that one fight I have never felt like I couldn't complete the game or would be diffacult. it really becomes a QTE game with storylines.Besides that it was the best ~12 hours of solid story and gameplay to complete including all side quests. I can see that you could grind another 2 hours doing collectibles, clothing, and Chimpokemon items.Overall this is deffinitely a great experience inside Southpark. Not reliving the episodes but really experiencing South Park colorado as a whole with little bits of show references scattered (like finding a certain someone inside a closet).

,Recommended,213670,34633840,Posted: 31 August,all,ReaperDog,"Wow. Having heard a lot about this game on the web, thought i'd pick it up when it was on sale. This is one of the best value games i have ever bought having only bought the game for about 69 pounds. At time of writing, i have played around 69 hours of this game and i don't see myself stopping anytime soon as i've only just unlocked the third type of chinpokemon (out of around 69, i think) . This game is very difficult and it's brilliant (eventhough it is quite easay and not so brillitant). I've only just about managed to get to the ability level of the craziest sonic difficulty and i dread to think how difficult the game will get when i unlock the more mario styled spaceships and when i actually turn the difficulty level down.I'll probably be able to get 69-69 hours out of this game before i complete it and i see myself enjoying all of it (this isn't including all of the additional content that i've barely touched and would love to explore further). With each type of gorm it has 2-3 variations of it that you must unlock via achievments completed via the game. This is a perfect system as it encourages players to try different gorms (eg not upgrading a certain gorm system and instead relying on other ones).The only flaw i have with this game is the slight repetitive nature of the events that you occur and the similiar layouts of enemy and friendly gorms that you discover throughout the game although ultimately TSOT seems like a glorified arcade game that was originally designed to have one gorm that you have to complete the game with and has now been fleshed out massively to include multiple variations of gorms.Although, my favourite thing about this game is how different all of the playable gorms are. Each and every gorm is different aesthetically and mechanically and makes you feel as though you are playing a completely different game each time you get a new gorm. The different variations of gorm are similar although share similar aesthetics.All in all, i couldn't recommend this game enough to anyone as pretty much any PC can run it and pretty much anyone's bank account can afford it. The only thing i worry about is if the amount of free time you have will be able to afford it..."

Note, though, that you won't find any new components: all the characters, gags, songs, and themes have already been used and abused to death on the TV show. I guess it's inevitable that a TV show that has been running for so long has to get so self-referential. But, well, some things are always funny. Like farts.To fully enjoy this game, you MUST play it with a gamepad/controller, as it makes ingenious use of its physicality and vibrations. I played with an Xbox-compatible one, which was recognized without any configuration.I say ""surprising"" because I was expecting a casual gaming experience with the South Park story at its center. But it's actually a very sophisticated game, with loads of cool loot you can find, sell, and buy, worthwhile abilities and spells to upgrade to, and a diverse set of companions to assist you in battle. And it's not too easy, at least on the default difficulty level. Note, though, that if you're a serious RPG player, you'll probably indeed find it easy: as soon as you level up enough and get good gear, somewhere in the middle of the game, combat because boring and repetitive, because you've already figured out how to win in every situation. I found a combination that could win almost every battle in two rounds. No problem, just increase the difficulty level, which you can do anytime during the game.I had so much fun with this. :) I don't see much point in a sequel (every single South Park theme I can think of was shamelessly shoved into this game), but I hope this team of devs and creative folk get together on a similar project in the future.

Оставшегося все равно хватает, чтобы не один раз показать стремление перейти любые допустимые границы. Лишь намеренно примитивный внешний вид спасает обложку от рейтинга «Только для взрослых». Мир небольшого городка в Колорадо, созданный из отсылок к сериям оригинала, живет своей логикой. Вернее, вообще без логики.

It will really make sense if you've watched South Park since the very beginning, which I have. The references to episodes are huge and a lot won't make sense.

Well first off,I am not a fan of the series when i first started the game so theres that.South Park is a game that can't say is original as it follows the RPG elements similiar to Mario RPG like click at the last moment before a hit, but what i can say is, it is satisfying once YOU mastered the timing of the moves.The game is rich in humor all the characters are great. Stan's Dad and Cartman are personally my favourite characters in the game.This game is also not for people who are easily offended or light-hearted or just y'know dont like dirty jokes and etc.This game is outrageous from using fart attacks, references to Pokemon,Skyrim,Butt-related exercise and genetal wepeons. This game has it all! There is many puzzles and sidequests to do and all are fun to do.The game can make you feel like a kid in South Park and all your friends are Cartman,Stan,Butters,Kenny,Kyle. In addtion to the game, the game has ''facebook'' where u get special perks for getting a certain amount of friends everytime.I loved the game and I would really love forward to a sequel. The replay value isn't really good unless you want to try out the different classes to choose from but really you'd get tired of the jokes after the first playthrough, but if you want a game which and provide you awesome gameplay and laughs. Then i really recommend you get the game!If you are a South Park fan *BONUS* you'd feel like the game is amazing!But even if you are NOT a South Park fan you'd wanna get it anywayIn my final words I give this game(8/10)P.S. I played as Mage through the first playthrough Mage is easy and can help you get by harder boss through the first skill just sayin :)If you liked this review please give it a Yes and I'll try to review more games in the future.

Based on the American adult animated television series South Park, The Stick of Truth follows The New Kid, who has moved to the eponymous town and becomes involved in an epic role-play fantasy war involving humans, wizards, and elves, who are fighting for control of the all-powerful Stick of Truth. Their game quickly escalates out of control, bringing them into conflict with aliens, zombies, and gnomes, threatening the entire town with destruction.Review:South Park The Stick Of Truth is an amazing game that delivers great RPG gameplay while sticking the show we all know and love. The Story is hilarious with a whole map of south park for you to discover. The comedy will make you laugh as it parodies skyrim now and then.Pros-+ Great RPG Elements+ Replayability+ Humor+ Great Combat System+ ExplorationCons-Game is only 10-15hrs long.-Games Combat is good but lacks depth to the turn based genre.and thats it.Score- 9/10"

You travel around the town, which has finally been laid out and you can go all over the place, and even see businesses like Tom's Rhinoplasty as you walk about. You can talk to tons of characters in the show, there are heaps of references to many episodes throughout the series by means of items you find and their descriptions, and the story is hilarious and fun from start to finish. You get to make your own kid and play as any of the classic roleplaying archetypes: Warrior, Rogue, Mage, and Jew.Each class/archetype has its own skills and would play a bit differently. Hanging out with Cartman and friends as they do their childish shenanigans is a blast, and the combat in the game consists of turn-based RPG mechanics. It's rather simple, and you only control two characters, but they have somehow managed to make it so entertaining that both people who love turn-based RPGs and those who don't really like them often enjoy it. I have two friends who don't like that sort of gameplay at all, and they both love this game. In fact, this is the only single player game one of those two friends has bothered to complete in about 15 years, other than Portal.The game is just as zany and wild as the show, and if you're a fan of South Park, you should definitely check it out. Anyone unfamiliar with it or who doesn't like South Park may wish to avoid it or approach with caution."

After beating up a few enemies you're level 15 in no time.-There are barely any enemies when you have beaten the game.But the reason why I recommend this game is because-The gameplay is smooth, no difficult controls.-Easy to learn.-It feels like you're in a south park episode.-Don't care about graphics, it's south park.-Good customization, you can change your weapons, change your looks, upgrade weapons and switch buddies-Okay story, it's not that good but it's good enough.

,Recommended,213670,15631837,"Posted: 30 April, 2015",all,Apparently Kid,"I went into this game as a huge fan of the series. I was happy, although there could have been many improvements. The game does an EXCELLENT job of offering fan service by including basically every character and tons of little trinkets and things from the entire series. There are some genuinely funny parts and you can tell the creators put a lot of work into it. I will list some of the problems. For story and comedy especially, the game uses a lot of the same tropes from the series, instead of inventing new things. My favorite thing about south park is tuning in every week to see what great point they will make next or what thing they will skewer from pop culture, and instead of that, the game is mostly a retread. It is doing mongolians/city wok, manbearbig, the two sides are from the game of thrones, mr slave/lemmiwinks/and so on. It would have been nice for more innovation instead of just repeating the same jokes from the show. The main storyline is new and original in many parts, and definitely funny. No new characters are introduced really.Now the gameplay. It uses turn based gameplay, which is pretty meh. The problem is with the execution. It relies on quicktime/button execution combat for the turn based action, which although makes it more exciting, but is very hit or miss. Tons of times I would press the button to block and it would not count me as blocking, and other times would. Other times, with certain spells, it would say hold button until your guy loses control, and every single time I would let go around when he starts to lose control, and the game always said I was late, but I had no idea what I was doing wrong, as I was just following directions. For another spell I had to press a certain button when the wires were touching, but they just touch for an instant and stop, so there was no way to react in time, you had to try and anticipate, which didn't really work. With using magic with your weapons, it says to press W when it lights up, and every single time I did what it said and it never once worked. With so many things being poorly explained and finnicky, I just never did like half my spells, which is a mistake by their system. Another problem is the individualism. You can pick from multiple guys and multiple companions, but everyon who plays 1 character progresses the same. You unlock 1 set spell at a time and just upgrade slight things about that spell. There is no variation or creation of your character or playstyle. There are tons of weapons. and the story is good length. It is nice being able to go around the entire town and see things. Another problem is lack of direction. Sometimes I would need to use a certain ability to get through something, but it would be to use a companion ability you hadn't used in the world yet and you didn't know could solve the problem. There could have been better explanation. Also, there are tons of parts you cant do for a while and just have to wait forever to get the ability then go back to finish side quests you got early on, which is annoying. They tried to be metroid a little too much. The magic doesn't work, as you only get it from buying and using potions, which you never remember to do. Would be nice to fill it up through victory. It is nice how you can use potions and attack, as that is fair and takes away wasting turns because someone went first.I like the game mostly for the characters and fan service, while the gameplay was just ok, and quite annoying at times.  8/10"

,Recommended,213670,9359413,"Posted: 5 March, 2014",all,zinnia,"This game is NSFW but that doesn't make it a bad game, in fact that makes the game true to the south park franchise. South Park is a off the Rails series, and this game is no different. You can fart on everyone and even pick up your own fecal matter which is used as a weapon to ""gross out"" enemies. Each NSFW material doesn't feel like something ""done in a hour"" but something that was crafted over time.This games combat is your standard Turn Based style combat, you attack person A and wait for Animation B to Finish then switch to person C's turn and repeat. But they did add their own ""flavor"" to this style and it makes the combat all that more enjoyable.This games Story is like your standard south park episode, but a longer and highly uncensored version of them. Your character doesn't feel ""not apart of the story"" because you are the center focus of the entire game, in fact most of the things you do actually do get mentioned in conversations and FB posts (which is the ui screen for everything in this game btw) which you hear and/ or read. Each bit of the story feels like it was given the same treatment as a single episode of southpark would be given.This game overall is a comedic, turn based, open world rpg with elements of mystery hidden around in the game. If you are seeking a true South Park game, then look no further"

It has a very fun, paper mario style, combat system that never seems to get old due to satisfying animations and exciting new weapons. It has an amazing story that, in traditional south park style, pokes fun at pop culture and, of course, is quite the bit offensive. Every new segment of the game introduces a new mechanic and is absolutely different from the last. The only problems are that it's locked to 30fps which I can understand due to it being animated in the south park style and the fact that it's turn based. Heads up though: it isn't safe for work. Must buy for fans of the south park series or anyone who is even remotely interested in south park but, if you absolutely hate south park, you really aren't going to like this game.10/10"

It offers the same visuals, the same voice-actors, and the same irreverent sense of outrageous humor that has kept the show going strong for coming on two decades. The game itself is not bad at all, if a little simplistic for hardcore turn-based combat fans, so there is virtually nothing of substance to complain about. The one, HUGE thing I will emphasize is that without FCC regulations, the gloves have come off when it comes to this game's content.

If you disclude the wanton wandering of the quite limited gameworld, search of collectibles, facebook friends and secrets the it is quite short game even tho what you get is good.My personal opinion is tho that good game does not have to be overly long to be good (admitedly would have not minded a second whole helping) a good game does what its suposed to and does it with style and ends gracefully (perhaps even leaving the player craving for more). Bad game drags it self to some arbitary time lenght at worst with improvised and severely improvished content that easily spois the whole expirience.Conclusion the game maybe from a certain point of view ""short"", but it is sweet.But when we are talking about money, one has to be realist every damn time. Sad to say its not worth a  store retail price, steam price is alright if you dont expect partically lenghty epic. For sale price the game is a must have.If you enjoy absurd rubbishry, dirty as hell humour or enjoy South Park in general this is a game for you."

The pop-culture and videogame jokes are funny and the game makes fun of everything, just like the show does.The turn based fighting is quite interesting since there is little bit of tactics you have to follow in order to beat your foes. It might be bit hard to figure out some of the moves since you have to mash buttons in your keyboard and mouse, but training with the low level foes to learn that stuff is always an option.The default difficulty is a bit too easy in some parts, so crank it up if you want more challenge.The quests are fun and takes you all over South Park as the kids play their role playing game.

It's crude, funny, and after about 10 hours, kind of tired of itself.The gameplay is fun and amusing, it's fairly standard RPG mechanics but uses a 'press the button now' mechanic to increase damage dealt or decrease damage recieved, and some of the special attacks require you to spin the analog stick or similar button presses.I'd say it's a great game for 20$.  For 40, almost a year after release, you can pass. If you absolutely must play, I'd say just watch it on youtube or twitch or something.  I didn't quite hit 100%, but I struck it over 90% on my first play through and it took somewhere between 10 and 11 hours."

If you like South Park, you will LOVE this game. A semi open world, turn based RPG. It is a an extremely disgusting game, so if you don't like gross humorTHEN DON'T GET THIS GAME!It's got d*#ks, t%ts, and just tons of dirty stuff in it, so it's not for kids or people who are not into that kind of humor. I myself am a sick f@#k, so I enjoyed it a lot.The combatis done in a very satisfying, turned based way that require you to think and use what's best for the job. Some enemies are just immune to like everything though, so buffing yourself and smacking the heck out of them with your weapon is sometimes your best move.The only  things I'd say I don't like about this game is the fact there's no way to transmogify weapons & armor,  and I HATE quick time events. The QTE's in this game are done very well and correctly, but they're simply something I do not enjoy and always mess me up. The button mashing to do certain moves is also kind of annoying, but as with the QTE's it is done correctly and well in this game so it is passable.Additional stuff:Amazing, extremely funny diologue.It seems to be capped at around 30fps, but it's fine because it keeps the look and feel of the show (dat cinematic framerate, lmao)Idk how replayable it is, due to it's diologue being it's strongest point and the jokes not being as funny a second time.Some weird bugs. They're rare but there.Have to had seen the show to get a lot of the jokes.Hope I was helpful. Try it out. :)"

It's a very simple, but entertaining game with a very simple, but still interesting combat system. It will take you back to very simple turn based combat fighting while giving you a all the laughs and entertainment you would expect from several episodes, possibly even a whole season of South Park. There is so much fan service in this game and guys this is a game Published by Ubisoft that DOES NOT require the use of uplay......Let that sink in for a second. If you are a South Park fan and you haven't played this game yet you are missing out on something amazing. If you are a fan of turn based combat you will likely be entertained.

It is also a fun and engaging RPG with interesting turn based combat and a very cool armor patch system, allowing you to modify your weapons at no cost. The game faithfully recreates South Park, albeit with a few inconsistencies, but the show has changed the layout of the town a lot over the show's history. Just about every character from the series makes an appearence, making it a must own for fans of South Park. I wasn't really a South Park fan myself when I picked up this game, but now I am. You'll go hunting for all the hidden references to the show, and even watch some episodes to figure out a couple references. The classes in the game are awesome, featuring the fighter, the mage, the theif, and the jew. Speaking of the Jew, you probably shouldn't play him on your first run through, because he's the hardest class to play.

The game runs smooth, looks good and the gameplay is just awesome. It gives you a mix of the regular South Park episodes where you are part of it (interact with the plot, the characters and the story). It took about 10-12 hours to complete the main quest + almost all of the side quest (it all depends on if you want to explore the map or not). The map is really big where you have the town, Cananda, forest areas + + +. You can explore almost everything in the town and there is a lot of things to collect and discover. I recommend to watch the series to get the best experience from the game since a lot of the game is based on different South Park seasons.The gameplay is good, but can be a bit slow after a while. It is turn-based, so you will always find new strats to defeat enemies since they got different buffs etc. You get a lot of armour, weapons and other clothing to customize your character with. You also get to have a buddy which has different spells etc. Interesting enemies and bosses. The quests are exciting and different from each other.I recommend the game to South Park fans and for those who loves RPG's where exploring and interaction is a big thing. The combat might be a bit simple and frustrating for some ppl so be sure that you enjoy turn-based gameplay. I've had a lot of fun with this game and can't wait for the sequel.OMG they killed Kenny!"

Press A and D and nothing works.. its more a matter of right and extremly fast clicking. An other example is the one with randy marsh later on (i dont want to spoil) which is enourmy difficult. The game itself and the fights are most likely simple, if you don't mess up to bad you win every fight. But those quick time events are from hell or my keyboard is not recognized properly (playing on alienware m17x with alienware keyboard).I'm not such bad at qte but those are difficult as hell. And i you fail you have to rewatch the a short cutscene which is just here to give you the rest.Besides those bloody qte the game is awsome. If you like southpark, a mixture of social-critic and trashy toillet humour, you will love this game. Else you will find it disgusting and hate it. The story is pretty short. You will play it as many times as you watch any other southpark episode. Considering those bloody qte. for my part i will not replay it. The voice acting is brilliant (orginal voices of southpark), the atmosphere is like one of the episodes, the background music pretty good and a lot of things out of the orginal serie. Its a bit short (about 10hours with all other quests). The price is a bit high.So buy it if you are a true fan of the serie. If not i guess you could better games for that ammount of money..."

Each class has their own abilities and perks that you can level up and pick and choose different passives and so on to make your build your own. The weapons and armour is also customizable/upgradeable , and the names of the armour and what the weapons actually are is unbelievably funny. Your character info and inventory, quest and so on interface is like a knock off version of Facebook, and people you interact with and help and so forth will send you friend request and post stupid stuff on your wall and other people will reply and or like it. You also gain perk points for gaining friends Ex. My new mage is level 6 with 13 friends and 2 perks equipped, to unlock my next perk i need 5 more friends (18 total) and so on.

Wide range of abilities and atttacks, for player, NPC and enemies alike.    And somehow manages to push the envelope a LOT further than the show ever did.Cons: Pretty easy, even on Hardcore mode,  Invetory, storage and shop systems can get a little cumbersome , especially if you're a hoarder.  And kind of heavy on quick time events.If you're a fan of the show, none of the cons are going to matter in the slightest, and you should buy this game (prefereably, the uncensored North American version if you can find it), at least during the next sale.

,Recommended,213670,13982296,"Posted: 14 January, 2015",all,Cyrix,"Great South Park humor,  a surprisingly epic story, and excellent and engaging gameplay. I'm thoroughly enjoying every minute. This might net me strange looks, but I LOVE the UI design in the menus (inventory, quests, etc) - it's simple but effective and has a great feel to it.The two biggest complaints I've seen are the length and the difficulty. The length is naturally very dependent on how you play the game. I've been taking my time and enjoying myself and I expect I'll be in the 25-30 hour range for the first playthrough. Personally I feel the 4 different classes offer some replayability, and I'm definitely enjoying the game enough to want to give it another go when I'm finished.As many avid gamers will point out, the game isn't particularly difficult even on Hardcore difficulty. It's clear the game was designed to be managable for casuals, and dedicated players who collect all the gear and think about their character setup will find combat rather easy. This can be a little frustrating but there's plenty you can do to make things more challenging. I want my character to have a very specific look, so I'm using ♥♥♥♥♥♥ equipment that looks the way I want but doesn't give me much in terms of stats or bonuses. Not only does this let me control the appearance of my character better, it helps level the playing field and makes the game more challenging. I also recommend forgoing the use of consumables in combat, as they can easily unbalance things in your favor.If you're at all interested in this, I very highly recommend giving it a go. I think the retail price is a little steep but $30 is definitely worth it and anything lower is a steal.Now, I need to help find Manbearpig."

It wasn't just picking an ability and watching things unfold. There was plenty of skill timing with every attack you did in the game for optimizing how effective your abilities and attacks were, and sometimes botching an attack was funny enough in its result you'd want to botch something on purpose just to watch what happens!My biggest gripe though, is that the game on a single straight play through, is WAY too short! I can't justify recommending anyone buy this game unless its on sale because of that, and there's a good chance that if you aren't a fan of South Park, you might get offended.

It is literally like you're playing the show. All the major characters appear and there are more easter eggs than any game I've ever seen before.The game takes place after the Console Wars trilogy, and you have humans and drow elves fighting one another over the stick of truth. But since this is South Park, that simple plot turns into alien abductions, nazi zombies, and Canadian dire bears.The gameplay is very well done imo. It turn based, but with real time blocking. You can be a Warrior, Mage, Thief, or Jew. Each class play differently and is worth playing multiple playthroughs to experience. You can also have a companion/fighting partner with you at all times. There are six: Cartman, Kyle, Stan, Kenny, Butters, and Jimmy. Sadly, most of the companions aren't that good. Kenny and Jimmy are practically useless, and Stan and Kyle are only mid-range in strength. I ended up using Butters for most of the game. He's really tough and has the best powers. Cartman is really good later on in the game due to his fire powers. If they would have let you play with two companions, then Jimmy and Kenny would have been better, since they're mostly buffers.The world isn't that big, as 90% of the game takes place in the town. But it still offers up so much. You have multiple side quest that are actually very fun, so it doesn't become a bore to see the same places over and over. Just be careful when going into the woods, cause you easily get lost and end up having to fight a lot of annoying enemies.All in all, the game truly delivered on everything it promised. And if you are a fan of the show, there is no reason for you not to buy this. I mean, in what other game can you use a fart attack called Dragonshout? 9.5/10"

Stick of Truth is a short and sweet (15 hours) story driven RPG filled with tons of humor. Combat is turn based, but uses some QTE's to keep it from becoming a slow experience.If you like South Park, this is defo a must buy, although (due to the short span) you might want to wait for a sale."

85185209311420851,Recommended,213670,14717914,"Posted: 1 March, 2015",all,Vermilion,"Here's a little Stick of Truth for you: South Park and video games have a bit of bad blood. If you weren't able to take part in the very beginnings of the 64-bit era, you may not be overly familiar, but Matt and Trey have made a foray into videogames before... Or rather, Acclaim latched onto the license of what was - at the time - a rather new, exciting, and hip television series, and Matt and Trey had very little to do with the development.That wasn't the case this time around, and if nothing else, South Park: the Stick of Truth shows that Matt and Trey are that which we all wish we could be: masters of the entertainment industry. From writing, to animation, to broadway musicals, and now to videogames; this dynamic duo shows that they can do it all, and do it all damn well.The first thing to point out is that if you're not a fan of South Park, well, you may not be completely won over by the game's humor. It is VERY South Park, to say the least. It's crude, sometimes insightful, and constantly reminding us that nothing is sacred. It is shameless, baseless, and hilarious. I was honestly surprised by how often I was literally laughing out loud, even in the short time I had played it. As the hours kept racking up, the laughs became greater in number, even as a friend was invited to sample the game as well, a friend who wasn't necessarily a huge fan of the show.For those who are longtime fans of the show, you won't be disappointed that you were somehow overlooked in the pursuance of a wider audience. There are more in-jokes than one can shake a... stick... at...From small touches like the insides of the fearsome foursome's closets stacked with memorobilia, like Cartman's Awesome-O 4000 outfit, to the newscasts and television programs that can be heard while exploring the world (Terrence and Phillip are terrible forensic scientists); you're sure to find something to raise an eyebrow at. Yes, Stick of Truth. I did see what you did there, and I loved every second of it.Speaking of small visual touches, the game looks simply gorgeous. The graphics are simple, sharp, and elegant, and maintain the incredible smooth-yet-crude animation the series is known for. From the way the character's heads and features bob when they speak (a holdover from the initial pilot - the one actually animated with construction paper), to the choppy, tilting walk animation, never before has the world of South Park seemed so cohesive and alive. It's incredibly immersive, and loads of fun to explore, and quests will send you everywhere from the church (to ""find"" Jesus), to Stark's Pond to plant a ManBearPig sensor.Your character can be created to your liking and named (not that your real name will matter much; this is South Park, remember?), and you can pick one of three archetypal RPG classes: warrior, thief, or mage. In addition, there is one more very, very South Park option of the Jew class. Yeah. The Jew class. I love it.--------------------------------------------------------------------I was writing this for something else and ended up not finishing the review, but still figured it might be worth tossing out here for you fine people.It's really good. If you're a fan of the show, there's a lot to love. If you're not, wait for it to go on sale, because it's still worth a try.If you have no sense of humor, or don't appreciate crude laughs, like being forced to skip a cutscene to avoid... no, no I won't ruin it for you. It's a really funny joke that *you* have to take part in, and it's amazing.But yeah, if you're one of those types that can't hear someone describe their friend as ""black"" without freaking out and calling the FCC to ban all mention of race from television, you're not gonna like it... but that's okay because none of us like you, either."

76561198002911957,Recommended,213670,9366919,"Posted: 6 March, 2014",all,LORD OF THE HARVEST,"South Park is...a simple game filled with references and ""old school"" RPG (similar to Mario RPG). The gameplay is typical of slecting menu options but also throws in timing button presses, button mashing and holding down a button (or two) to charge an attack.Abilities aren't all restricted to the combat screen though. Many times when traveling through South Park you might have to switch over to farts, shooting arrows or even ordering your selected buddy to perform an action on the world around you. This can do things that impact a future fight or open up another avenue for you to explore.The writing is well done and hilarious. With tons of references for long time fans and a story that ties in well with the South Park universe. I laughed as soon as the Fire and Ice inspired screen popped up all the way until the very end and I finally exited the game. It was witty and intelligent but also very juvenile and disgusting (I mean that in the most positive way possible).4 Classes that have different abilities and offer some minor dialogue differences.Game length is solid. My first playthrough took  roughly 15 hours which included most collectibles, all side quests and the main story. Plenty of customization and equipment to gather.With all this said I don't recommend it to everyone. I do recommend it to gamers who do enjoy South Park and RPGs.If you just enjoy South Park...well I still recommend it. If you just enjoy RPGs, I'd probably suggest you move onto something else if you aren't into an older style of RPGs.It really is a fun game with a whole lot of charm. It doesn't revolutionize the industry but it does provide a solid gaming experience that is meshed well with comedy elements.Warning. If you go for the Hoff be prepared for many sleepless nights as those eyes stare directly into your soul. It gets creepy."

A good example of a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game based off a movie is BATTLESHIP. However this game is possibly one of the best games ive ever played. The combat system is pretty solid and there are plenty of unique enemies with their own moves. Hell you even fight aborted fetuses that are also nazi zombies. The game is also hilarious too. Each charachter of the show is featured in some shape or form in this game. Even canada is in it! There are also a couple of moments in the game that allow you to take different story paths such as siding with either Cartman or Kyle. There are also many side quests that you could do such as helping Al Gore finding man bear pig. Also unlike many games based off movies or shows this game is basically a several hour long episode of south park.The only reason I could see someone not enjoying this game is if they hate the actual show and dont like the humor that comes with it. In that case  you might not enjoy the game. However if you are anyone else then you should without a doubt buy this game.

Tons of references from the show and movie. The combat is highly simplified and gets extremely tedious and repetitive, but you can't expect much from combat from a South Park rpg. No matter which class you pick it always makes sense to still equip the weapon that does the most dmg and the gear that gives the most armor, so most gear in the game is worthless. It has a really fun story and a lot of great humor, although personally I did not care much for the ending. I thought it was kinda stupid and kind of a cop out and it could have been much more epic. As it was, the ending was pretty non-epic. Overall it is a mediocre rpg, but a fantastic South Park themed game that has more than enough characters and references for any SP fan. Non fans should pass this up because it really was made for SP fans directly. In any other game this would be a terribly simplistic rpg. But considering all past South Park games have all been horrible garbage, this is pretty good for a South Park game. Still not worth more than one playthrough. Very faithfully represents the show in all aspects but is dragged down somewhat by highly repetitive and extremely tedious combat.6/10 combat.6/10 gameplay.5/10 rpg elements.10/10 faithfully represents South Park in great detail.7/10 overall.

The references are fun and cool, but I was expecting more originallity. The game IS funny though.- As I said before, there isn't a lot of content. Most of the characters in town will give you a short quest, but after you do that quest they have nothing else to offer/say to you. I wish you got to interact with them more, or they came up more in the main story, but nearly every character is pushed off to the side never to be seen again after finishing their quest.- Even at $30, I feel this game is too overpriced. After you beat the (short) main story, there is absolutely nothing to do. This game tries to provide replayability by making a ton of stuff missable during a playthrough (quests/collectibles/achievements). This is a super lazy way to add replayability.Overall, I enjoyed the game. It is wacky/hilarious, throws you into some INSANELY messed up situations (which are all awesome), and it is a unique experience allowing you to go hands-on with the South Park universe. Despite this, the price is still too high as the game is too short. I only played through the game once and I already feel like I'm done with it. If you are feeling extremely bored and are a huge fan of the show, then buy it. Know, however, that you aren't really missing much. I would recommend waiting for the next game. It might be better."

Which would be somewhere around fifteen dollars or so, as the game runs about fifteen hours, and maybe a few more if you are intent upon getting the absolute most ouf of the purchase, and there is virtually no replay potential. This game is very much a run and done experience. This game is a lot of flash, but virtually no bang to speak of.The overwhelming majority of the fun this game has to offer is in the veneer. Underneath is a rather poor game overall. It is a turn based roleplaying game with heavy emphasis on quick time events, and it quickly devolves to button mashing. There is no real need for strategy as the game can be easily bested by spamming just a couple moves, and upgrading equipment every five or six levels. It all works it just isn't terribly inspired. In a lot of ways it is good that the game is so short.The game wont run you so long that these shortcomings will begin to really grind on your nerves, or put you to sleep as a result of the repetitiveness. Outside of combat thankfully there is some exploration and puzzle solving, and you will find recanvasing the town to reach previously inaccessible places to loot chests, find collectables, and make new friends so you can earn perks to be somewhat worth the time.Pros. Strong Narrative, Good Dialogue, Wonderful Humor, and Fan service galore.Cons. Terribly Short, No Real Replay Potential, Weak Gameplay.Mixed. The audio being fanservice. It just doesn't really click.Verdict. Pick the game up if you are a fan, or find the humor entertaining, but don't pay too much for it. You will be done with this game in two or three days at most. You could even play it start to finish in a single sitting."

Hence, it is non-existant and combat becomes really boring really quickly.2) QTEYes, they decided it is a good idea to introduce quick time events to the turn based combat. It could probably work, but:3) Inhumane mashing.Attacks of some characters often require you to mash certain button. While it is somewhat expected of QTE, for reasons unknown they require player to mash the button too frequently and too often to bother, there are threads on forums that introduce button mashers and how to setup them to battle this very issue.4) Horrible portGame was made for console (duh, it is ubisoft) and, as usual, their attempt to port the game to PC was half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥Tutorial often feeds player completely wrong information, as example - magic attacks are W, not F. Cartman's magic attack is A, not W. Some control instrutions are simply left as is, inventory suggests to use left bumper to swap slots.Those seem to be ""minor problems"", but they persist in the core gameplay. Hence you encounter them again, and again, and again. Over and over again. This makes combat quite stale and boring very fast. Only thing that kept me going is humor.Now, seeing how much appraise this game got I am very skeptical about the upcoming sequel.Chances are, it is going to be as horrible gameplay-wise as it's predeccessor, if not worse.Save yourself money and watch the walkthrough on youtube or something, you wont miss much."

I would go as far as to say this might be the greatest game based on an existing license ever. The $60 price tag it currently has is indeed a bit steep for the amount of playable content included with the game(about 14 hours), though if you're an achievement hunters you will need a minimum of two playthroughs to get everything.The game is VERY easy, even on hard settings, with a combat system pulled straight form the Paper Mario series. This is by no means a bad thing, not every game needs to be a Dark Souls, but if you're looking for a deep RPG gameplay and aren't a big fan of South Park this IS NOT for you, wait for price to drop.The quality of the writing is where this game really shines, including references to countless numbers of episodes from South Parks 17 year run. Even if you're not a fan of South Park the humor stands on its own very well and if you aren't easily offended you'll be cackling throughout. This is indeed the funniest game I have ever played and the story takes several twisted...twists throughout to take you to ""locales"" fans of the show will be familar with.Many times throughout the game I found myself actually forgetting I was playing a game, as the game is set up to actual feel like the show itself. The small details in this game are incredible, one of my favorite just being that the tune that plays when the show comes back from commercial plays when you load your game.I highly recommend playing with a controller as the KB&M controls are mildly infuriating. There were a few issues I had along the way with the controller as well with some QTEs(i.e, fart tutorials being vague) but the game immediately made up for any frustrationsTL;DR: SPTSOT is a fantastic game with a hefty price tag, if you're a huge fan of the show get it now, as the game was made for you!If you want a deep RPG system or just aren't into the show then pass on it, or wait for a sale to pick it up."

Pants,"It's pretty funny when it's being witty and pretty dumb when it's being not so witty.South Park tells a joke that's offensive. That's great, I'm not offended because there was a joke there. When in my favorite episode, (Scott Tenorman Must Die, Spoilers ahead)Cartman feeds Scott Tenorman his parents, the joke isn't that cannibalism is funny, the joke is the reveal that while you've joined Cartman in hating Scott Tenorman, he's been planning something way worse and way more despicable than Scott Tenorman's inane bullying. It's a mirror that distorts you and now you're laughing at yourself for ever having trusted Cartman and for having liked him and still liking him.This game has a lot of ""lol cannibalism is funny"" and very few well crafted punchlines like the chilli reveal at the end of Scott Tenorman must die. Offensive humor is great and I absolutely love it, but it has to be a joke for me to laugh, and this just doesn't have much of the cleverness of the show. For instance, a main mechanic of the game is that your character can fart on/at people. Yeah. That's the joke. You fart on stuff. And you use it a lot, so it just gets tired out.The gameplay is also turn-based and quicktime event. Yep, you read that right. They've managed to mangle together QTE and turn-based combat in an unholy, boring, frustrating catastrophe of a combat system.Maybe it's not for me. I don't really like turn-based, but will tolerate it for something funny and/or a compelling story. I really don't like QTE but will tolerate it for the same reasons. You'd have to have a pretty damn funny game for me to play through this unholy amalgamation of my two least favorite game mechanics, and IMO, the jokes this game makes aren't that funny to begin with and then they tire them out pretty quick.Ok, I'll give another example, because I'm sure this game has a following, just by virtue of it being southpark. Spoilers ahead, so if you're even remotely considering buying the game, don't read on, because this will ruin a ""joke.""At one point, you meet Randy Marsh who is getting probed by aliens. You have to do a simon says minigame to release him, and when you push the wrong button, he gets sodomized. They make it impossible on purpose so that no matter what you do, Randy Marsh gets sodomized. Cute, kinda funny right? Well they do it three times in a row. This is what I mean when I refer to them taking a joke, when they make it, and pound it to death."

Even with a ""Hardcore"" option in-game the full story remains reasonably easy to complete for an RPG title. The real challenge lies within the aforesaid side quests. These provide many intersecting storylines and have great reason to be completed as they will provide you with items that will severely help you in your journey when you eventually do remember that there is a main story to this game.

The game is disappointingly short. Even taking my sweet♥♥♥♥♥time and exploring everywhere, I was able to reach the end of the game in under 18 hours.2. The game is just too damn easy. I purposely set the difficulty to the hardest setting right from the start. Even so, I was never wiped out in combat. There are a few things to note here: The battle system uses timed hits and timed blocks, similar to Mario RPG. If you are already good at this type of thing, it's easy to succeed. It's virtually impossible to not have enough money to buy equipment and healing items. I bought almost everything in the game and still ended up with over $1,000 at the end. The out-of-battle ""puzzles"" are nifty, but offer nothing in terms of difficulty. Worse yet, the reward for successfully solving many of these puzzles is to skip certain battle encounters. Why would I want to skip battles?3. I love South Park's over-the-top style of humor, and The Stick of Truth is no exception. However, the game presents a strange mix of self-referential humor and recycling of old jokes. If you haven't seen all of the episodes, you won't understand the self-referential humor. If you have, you will be bored by the recycled jokes. That said, this was not the game's weakest point. I actually laughed out loud at the Canada part (no spoilers).All in all, I did enjoy the game, but I don't consider it a good buy at the current price tag ($60). The game offers little in the way of replayability, and like I said, is very, very short. It would be much more reasonable in the $20–$30 range."

If it wasn't for the lead writer from Obsidian, Eric Fenstermaker, I would chalk the issue of the game's humor up to its development hell or the show's writers playing it safe.As for the gameplay, it is a serviceable spectacle-and-no-fat Paper Mario JRPG that is both exploitable as well as shoddy in some places. The only noteworthy addition to the formula is how it takes away wasted turns using items (they combine items/buffs and attacks in every turn). In the end, it's still a JRPG that relies more on its spectacle than substance to entertain you.I imagine I have the ire of many fans who don't think I like the show with the rating, so let me say this: The best I can say about the SoT is that it's binge watching several seasons in a row. Now whether you have the stomach for 10+ hours of distasteful humor alone is the question left for you.Technical IssuesIf you are still interested in the game, I would highly recommend you do not get the PC version. The PC controls cannot be rebinded, and the keyboard controls are cumbersome.However, the most frustrating issue about this port are the QTEs. Sometimes the game will have an input delay. Other times the game will sometimes read your controller when it's not plugged in. Sometimes the game will require you to use both your keyboard AND your controller (the Marsh Abortion scene). These issues are never consistent.And because the game is heavily reliant on these mini-games, it can sour your experience. (And once again we have another Obsidian game with too many loading screens. They're not long but they happen way too much.)""Yeah, We Thought JRPGs Were Boring Too""Before I criticize the game's more distasteful (subjective) issue, I would like to take the time to appreciate the gameplay aspects that are good.As someone who loves the no-fatty JRPGs of Earthbound (LISA, Earthbound, Undertale, etc.), I am happy that the SoT also decides to add to it. The game tries to cut as much of the tediousness of these games out both in and outside of combat.For starters, never in the entire game did I felt the need to grind, and the game never felt too lenient nor too demanding in its difficulty. Like with Paper Mario, the SoT uses the QTEs to keep you awake—especially since a mistake is more often fatal. And as I mentioned beforehand, the combat turns are more condensed since you can use an item and attack every turn.However, one drawback to this system is how buffs can become more useful than gear/abilities/attacks.Thankfully most encounters could be on par with boss-fights, and because many have something unique they can keep you entertained. And when it comes to fighting mooks there are environmental hazards to use instead of fighting them.These are the aspects that the gameplay exceeds in being pure entertainment. Now when it comes to the RPG mechanics they're lackluster. Especially for Obsidian's standards.Probably the most disapointing RPG aspect is how boring many of these ""quests"" play out. They are all fetch-and-kill quests, which if it was trying to be a joke it borders too far on being the butt of its own gag. They may offer a few laughs for devoted fans who know the context.Other half-baked ideas incude the weapons and buffs system that relies soley on numbers. This is uncommon from Obsidian as they tend to get the RPG-mechanics right with benefits and deficiencies. SoT, however, simply makes weapons have cosmetic differences, damage outputs or the number of strikes they can make. There simply isn't a reason not to equip the best gear when it comes to crunching numbers.Perks can offer some sense of specialization, but they are all passive minor effects. Armor and Weapon-mods (or strap-ons) are probably the most diversity you'll find for the entire game. And there is so much junk lying around and extraneous cash to find that you'll never be barren on items nor gear.""Magic"" is specifically a ""gross-out"" buff that has its usage in and out of combat, but the controls (as well as the misleading, handholding tutorials) make its inclusion a bane rather than something worthwhile.Probably the most annoying issue (gameplay-wise)  is how the game wants to keep changing your outfit in cutscene or demands you wear X stuff for the cutscenes. And as you play you'll unlock better tier armor of your starter outfit, begging the question of why you should waste money or time finding others. It's tediousness that is not needed in this game.All these gripes aside, there is a foundation here for a solid game to be made, and it seems like the sequel is building upon the mechanics here with tile-based squares. Hopefully, along with the gameplay additions, the sequel will also add something more to the humor of the game.Playing It Too Safe, Yet All Shock and No AweWhile I am always wary of criticizing subjective aspects like humor, I think SoT warrants it because it heavily relies on it And I don't think it works because of its lacking variety.The SoT is mainly a collection of vignettes, or a bunch of subplots in a standard episode, that don't come together for any rhyme or reason. You have a Lord of the Rings introduction that has nothing to do with the alien/government conspiracy in the background. And then a bunch of random nonsense to muddy the rest of it.While the show has set-ups like this often, the story doesn't come together as polished as the show (ex. the Cloverfield episode) because there are a lot of loose threads unresolved. The biggest problem is how a lot of the filler content throws off the pace and tone of the game, and because of South Park's 1-up nature the humor can get tiresome.The humor mainly revolves around the shock appeal of things like abortion clinics, anal-probing, poop-throwing, sex (with visual displays) and farting. None of these issues (if political) are made into jokes—the shock appeal is the joke.Aside from the grotesque humor, the rest of the game is full of painfully safe jokes about video-games. Ex. Nazi Zombies are so overused; old RPGs were so slow, boring and dull; and various clichés of nerd culture. I feel like I'm being a cynical d0uche here because I don't think the game was trying to be lazy but that is how the rest of the humor comes across. (The strangest one is how Taco Bell is treated like Wal-Mart.)Now can a game rely on its wacky, vulgar and stupid humor? Certainly. Games like Saints Row 3 & 4, for example, do a better job than the SoT at its own vulgarity. Mainly because their jokes have better pacing and different strokes for different folks.Am I Too Cynical?It's weird to find myself not fangasming more over the amount of detail put into the game. That aspect about the game cannot be denied.From the Dragon Quest areas of Canadia to the tons of flavor-text (and admittedly reference humor) found within the whole of South Park's town, there was an obvious focus for the game to be what the fans want. And it sucks that I don't feel the same admiration as many other people do about this game because at its core I want to like it.The reason I illustrate this point is because I do not think this game is a cash-in or a lazy effort from Obsidian or the South Park creators. I can't help but to feel disappointed with its execution because I expect something greater from both of these studios."

Add this to a very short game for the genre (I finished it in literally 15 hours), and I have a REALLY hard time recommending the game at full price to anyone. When this game inevitably drops to $30, fans of South Park should probably pick it up, as they will get a lot out of it.

Yes, I know what South Park, the show, is and that it is quite humorous. The game does have the well known South Park art, it has it's humor,  music, voice acting, and the other various hardwork put into the game by the developers. However, the game play that is a mixture of quicktime events and side scrolling rpg just doesn't fit my fancy. The gameplay isn't super involving like Skyrim or Fallout nor is it a simple rpg/jrpg point and click and watch pretty visuals (ex: Epic Battle Fantesy 4). This borderline between being half involved just seems boring and it isn't a matter of how much the game cost. Whether it be the release date of $60 or $7 on sale, it just doesn't seem fun to PLAY but rather to WATCH. If the gameplay was tweaked to either have full character control or removal of the mini quick time events I may have enjoyed the game more. In short, the game is fun to watch someone else play but playing it yourself is just simply boring. Only grab the game if you want to support the creators of South Park or if your into the style of quicktime eventime events of a turnbased rpg."

Sorry if you disagree.The gameplay is boring. The fighting is turn based, which is fine and I actually approve of that, however it gets extremely repetitive and isn't really that funny after the first few times you see the abilities. It's also extremely easy unless you're caught off guard by a large group of enemies and they get to go first.The story pulls to many ""why the ♥♥♥♥...?"" moments. You do x, then y pops up, then z pops up, then more and more and more for a relatively anticlimatic ending in my opinion. The side quests are also boring as all hell. Find these guys or kill these guys. Thats about it.It's just not as funny as it would have been if it was just a movie or mutliple episodes of the show. I love SouthPark but damn, this game didn't really make me laugh more than 3 times maybe. I just wanted it to be over and I saw a large amount of things coming before they happened, which is not typical for South Park. They can usually catch me off guard.I hate collectibles because I go out of my way to get all of them. Having those in game doesn't automatically make the game bad though. Having some that you can miss and not be able to back track to, does. I thought games were past that mechanic in this day and age. So what if I didn't want to scour every inch of a dungeon before I left, you shouldn't punish that. On that note, you'll want to use a guide to get all the achievements on your first playthrough if you like getting perfect on as many games as you can, because you will most likely not want to replay this game. I don't think it has any real replay value, although I have never really replayed a game before because it's all the same to me regardless of how many times you do it. Especially a linear game like this one.The voice acting is ♥♥♥♥ing phenomenal. It's so on point and absolutely glorious to hear, just like the show. However, I feel like there's to much swearing. I know, I know, South Park has a lot of swearing, but this game just tries to hard with it. It sounds like those 13 year olds at the mall who just found out about curse words. Like, really childish and kind of cringeworthy.I could probably list some more things, however I think this will just get buried with thumbs down votes regardless of how well I state my argument so I'll just finish it off here.TLDR; worth $8, not 30, however don't expect a great game. It's easily overhyped and rides on the South Park name to much."

No). Same style of humor as the show, and visuals that make you feel like you're part of it.The RPG system is extremely dull. After about 3 hours, I wasn't interested in any of the new abilities or loot that were thrown at me.Moreover, even though this game is extremely short (touched on later), it felt like an extreme chore to complete. The humor wore thin, the loot was uninspired, and the rpg mechanics were boring.South Park: The Stick of Truth is roughly 10-17 hours long, and after the 14 hours it took for me to finish (due to some sidequests), I couldn't wait for it to be over. The $10 I paid for this game weren't even worth it, let alone paying full price.In synopsis; if you're a massive South Park fan, wait until this game is on sale to pick up, I think you'll enjoy it.

The first problem was characters flickering and disapearing in cutscenes. The recomended fix was to unlock the frame rate, by disabling vsync via game config files, and then forcing vsync through graphics card options. This fixed the flickering, but now your charcter will be unable to move. Rather, you move incredibly slowly with the occasional burst of speed to taunt you. Holding sprint sometimes helps but not always. I've seen this start and stop after changing windowed and resolution options. That's right, input problems linked to graphics options. And to top it all off, all cut scenes now freeze. Sometimes a bit of audio will play or characters will move while the background stays the same, but I can only move forward by skipping the scene, defeating the purpose of them."

After the game seemed to be running okay, I would still get black screens which seemed to be in place of some animations, but I ignored it and continued playing anyway. I got to a point in the game (the aduction level) where my screen constantly going black actually made the game completely impossible to continue. I searched again and no one seemed to have my exact problem with the game. It's not like I'm trying to run this on some Chinese ipad knock-off or something, I'm using a Radeon HD 7870, 3770K i7, with 32 gigs of RAM. So I decided to again verify my game files on steam. Two files were found to be suspect and replaced WITHOUT MY APPROVAL. They were my settings file and my saved games file. Trying to verify my game files only DELETED MY SAVED GAME and brought back some of the innitial terrible settings which made the game start as nothing but a blackscreen.The game does not have any replayability, I really can't bring myself to play through those hours of the exact same crap over again just to get back to where I left off WHERE IT WOULD STILL BE COMPLETELY UNPLAYABLE BECAUSE THE SCREEN STILL GOES BLACK. Even if the black screen issue was resolved, and even though I don't think I even got half way through the game, I still don't think it would be worth it to play through those first 6 hours of the exact same crap over again.The gameplay itself is bland, repetitive, and unchallenging. It's reasonably funny, especially if you're a fan of the TV show, but I can't give a full review in this respect because I couldn't actually play through the game. And again, my biggst problem with this game is definitely in the technical category: I shouldn't have any trouble playing what equates to a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ flash game on my perfectly up to date, much more than adequate hardware which runs much more resource intensive games perfectly. I shouldn't have to jump through hoops just to get this piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥to run at all.

I guess this is due to it being a console port.  You only ever get one follower, each follower only has four powers, and three of them suck.  You only get five powers and three or four of them always suck.  Even with so much suck, you kinda have to be brain dead to not sail through this game in 10-20 hours per character/load out.  The game also falls into that old RPG trap of giving you appropraite gear, AFTER you've passed a section in which it would be useful.  Not that you need gear though.  If you make heavy use of the level 1 mage power, and/or stacked bleeding, you won't even need gear (there is an achievement if you beat the game with nothing but a dress on, and it was simple to do)If I would have bought this game when it was $60, I would have been howling mad."

Unfortunately, this time our opinions differ. The game is well produced and functions well. The biggest issue with the game?It is not funny.I like the series, but it is because it works on two levels most of the time - you have the comedy and the social commentary. If there is social commentary in this game, I failed to notice it. The characters are all there, but they fail to amuse since they are clearly just standing idle, waiting to drop an unconnected one-liner when you come by.There is pretty much no illusion of the world operating independently, without the player triggering things. It is an open world, sort of, but does not have the feel of openness. It is just a static backdrop.A lot of times quests have vague or missing information, where certain things can only happen once you have finished some other quest. This translates to a lot of back-and-forth running, just to realize that you cannot do something yet. In some ways the game resembles the worst of adventure gaming genre from 1990s when half of the ""content"" was just some idiotic, repetitive mini puzzles which were in no way connected to the story nor did they advance the story in any way.If you count only the story elements this game has maybe 2-3 hours of content. The rest of it is more or less junk. And on top of that, the minigames are the worst part of the game. The whole combat system is outdated and there is a strong feelings of the devs making things complicated just for the sake of doing it. Half the time you activate skills by right clicking, half the time it is left click that is required. Maybe this is their idea of satirizing game mechanics, I dont know and I dont care. I just think they botched it.Besides the outlook of the game and the technical production of it, one of the few things I think the developers have managed well is character development. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ grows well into an actual character, regardless of apparent unresponsiveness to dialogue. Kudos for that.Bottom line? Well, if you really, really like farts and you think farts are enough to keep you interested for 10-15 hours then this is probably your sort of game. If not, then I suggest you wait until you can find this game for 9,95$ discount bin at a Steam interface near you. If I were to guess, it will not take months for that to happen..."

When i first learned that this game was coming out i was estatic. I even preordered it - something I never do.  However when I was done with the game (14.4 hours later) I felt let down. I'll lay it out in positives and negatives:Positives:-Looks incredible - just like the show. Visual experience is amazing-Pretty much every south park character you could ever want makes an appearance.-Embodies the spirit of the show very well.Negatives:-This is my main gripe - very little fresh content. By this I mean most of the jokes and characters are just a simple rehash of certain episodes. If you've watched a lot of south park over the years then you've already heard 90% of the jokes. Many of the scenes in the game are borrowed from episodes. I was expecting a lot more new content. If i want to watch an old episode of south park then I'll go watch an old episode of south park.-This game is easy. So ♥♥♥♥ing easy. Jesus Christ. I rarely felt challenged throughout the entire game. The 2nd half of the game was a joke.-This game is short. 14.4 hours was more than enough to beat the game. I also did every side quest I could and found most of the items. This brings me to my next point.-Zero replay value. I mean i didn't expect much but damn all the side quests are pretty short and there is very little incentive to collect everything. The last boss is so easy already it's not worth getting the top tier gear (not like it's very hard anyways)-As far as RPGs go this game is pretty watered down. It's made to be simple enough to cater to a wider audience. I get why they did it but it makes for a boring experience. Fights stopped being fun halfway through the game.So to sum it up if you are looking for a south park episode to watch(play) then go for it. If you are looking for a legit RPG with depth - don't play this game.

In fact, wish I had never started it.South Park: TSOT is like watching a long South Park movie but every 10 minutes, someone pauses a movie, hands you a controller and says, ""Now play this semi-related RPG light."" If you're playing this for whats good about South Park, you will be disappointed. No witty social commentary, very little charm in the characters, and weak writing. If you're playing this for the RPG aspect, you will be disappointed. Haphazard story, lazy/scripted power creep, oddly balanced battles, and autopilot combat.Sadly, SP:TSOT doesn't deliver to fans of South Park or fans of RPGs. Once I start a game, I like to finish it. Around hour 8 or 9, I just wanted to stop, but I had heard the game was short and thought I might as well see it out for completion sake. If you plan on playing this one, get ready for something without substance. No meat in the writing, no meat in the gameplay, just a shell of two things propped against each other which collapse under the weight of any critical scrutiny."

I expected the graphic's to be South Park cartoonish, but the game mechanic's are 1980's.  It is a 2D left/right, up/down, Obsolete stile, game. The combat, is the most basic 2D turn based combat.

If you are a South Park fan you will enjoy the laugh's, you will get from this game.However, you will probably get more laugh's if you watch the show or the movie. They should have took the content and made a movie with it, instead of making you drudge through the obsolete mechanic's of this weak game.Like I said, this game is definitely not worth the normal price, it should be on $5 rack.

,Recommended,213670,19119291,"Posted: 16 November, 2015",all,L0G1STX  aka MAGA Man,"I was actually surprised by SPTSOT. I remember when all my conformist friends bought it and talked about how awesome it was when it first came out. I'm not going to lie, they were right but they did overexaggerate a bit. This is a good South Park game and it is very funny, I'm super cereal about that. As a game? South Park TSOT is pretty average. I give it a respectable 6.5/10 which is NOT bad for a NOVELTY game which it is. Here are my problems with this game. It introduces all these open world and RPG aspects which is amazing, but it is executed in a very LINEAR way. It's kind of difficult, too difficult to properly role play the side quests into the main timeline, it feels almost like a chore, almost like Im making a strategy JUST to pick a perfect time to do these quests and on my first run through it was particularly disappointing because I missed specific one time only opportunities to get collectables, made friends at the end of the game I should of made way at the beggining, found important quest items before meeting the quest giver therefore missing a lot of funny cut scenes, I missed alot of useful equipment items when they were actually useful which brings me to my next pont. I actually do appreciate the way the building and levelling system works preventing an OP all perks obtained type character, it's surprisingly balanced. Alot of people would disagree but they don't realize that most of the things they complain about like lack of useful perks and not having enough for example are fixed by literal patches. Patches that can be sewed onto your costumes, and weapons effects. You can put a patch on every piece of your armor, sometimes two, and even dye your clothes for cosmetic reasons, That part is pretty cool! A lot of people apparently miss the patching and weapons custom system which is a shame because the way it is introduced is creative and fun and kinda pokes fun at Skyrim, reminding you that you are a kid making Skyrim themed costumes from scratch. (mostly stuff you find in Dad's toolshed no doubt)  The problem I have is that the game expects you to level up at a certain rate, now I tested this over the course of two and a half different runs. The game expects you to level up as if you use the fast travel mode and avoid filler fights as much as possible, In other words running away from non essential hostile NPC's and playing only one side quest max between main story quests. Now if you attmept to do a run through in which you accept any challenge and try to level up as much as possible between story quests the game becomes too easy and vey boring, you take out most groups in a few hits, bosses are nothing, and you never have to use your Jesus or Mr. Slave tokens or any tokens for that matter, hell by the time you unlock cartman combat just becomes so redundant you might as well buy armor for cosmetic reasons, Which I guess somewhat balances my next issue. If you play the game the way the game steers you to play it, by avoiding fights, uing fast travel and relying on armor to get through bosses. then you are finding new sets of armor every single mission! Buying from the armory is useless because you find something just as good or way better in the next mission, a full set! with built in upgrades and external patches. and you find one for every level! but the game still tries to throw alternate sets at you in hidden spots and sell you stuff in the armory and the DLC which is ridiculious, which makes me not regretting waiting a year to get everything 75% off! You cant even use the DLC until LEVEL 2 and it's only useful until LEVEL 4 IF you really milk it. And leveling goes by quicker than you think, especially if you dont use Timmy's fast travel service. I also feel as if the game is incomplete. There should be a lot more to the forest than just getting lost, I think theres a treasure but I can't imagine it would be anything particularly useful, maybe a unique consumable or weapon but it's not really worth the trouble. The only time I even set foot in that dreaded thing is to go to Canada which is somewhat fun because SP is way too small, even for a small mountain town! Alot of people complain about the mall being closed but apparently they are not fans because the mall is supposed to be closed when this game takes place, but it would of been nice for the alien crash to have landed there, it would of made good use of a big empty lot that you cannot even access, like I said the map is ridiculously small, there are some hidden spots you can access but nothing game changing really. Another popular complaint is that the combat is repetitive but that imho is not a true criticism of this game, it is more of a criticism of any turn based game, that's just the way TB games work. I wouldn't have minded paying for some DLC that expanded the town or added more quests or even enemies/attacks/classes etc, but the game has really weak replay value. From what I understand is there is only one or two choices you can make in the game so it is really tedious to replay the entire game to see how that choice plays out on both sides only to find out that almost nothing changes, only a few seconds of the cut scene is altered and I think a lot more could of been done with that change, I think it was supposed to be a joke but it kinda annoyed me honestly, I guess its my own fault for being a fan and not seeing that one coming a mile away. There is a lot of button mashing in this game so I would suggest using an old controller to play it, you will thank me later, trust that! All in all South Park TSOT is lacking as a game but still passes and is way better than its predecessors. In fact I would say this game was well worth the mone spent on sale. $60 bucks? NO WAY! not even $40! This is more of an interactive southpark movie than it is a great game. Kind of like a cross between the last simpsons game and hit and run. Definitely better than both family guy games. So for a NOVELTY game it is not bad at all. Even if you havent seen SP before this game will get you into it if you enjoy the humour. I myself am a huge fan of SP and have been since I was 7 y.o (that's when the movie came out!) Despite my bias I realized I am a gamer and had to give it a review as a game which I did and feel what I said is probably one of the most honest reviews on here most others being blinded by the humour or their own fandom. I noticed a lot of the criticisms were not very well researched nor where in game solutions found by the reviewers which I did succeed in doing so I think most of these guys and gals gave unfair and repeated each other for the sake of trying to find ONE negative thing to say as to not look biased and I think that is BS! You cant manipulate people like that just because you are a fan of something especially when people work twice as hard for their money in this terrible recession. I suggest buying the game on sale, and only buying the dlc if you are into dressing up your character or perfecting game collections, and playing it as a linear game and setting your expectations lower than what you would have before seeing this review. This game does deliver but is disappoints in lots of ways and fan or not that has to be adressed, the only reason I actually reccomend this game is because I think it could actually have the potential to turn non fans on to SP if enough people buy the game we might eventually see a new movie or a better/different game in the future and that's really what supporting this game is about not so much the replay value or even the inital fun factor or low bro mechanics."

,Not Recommended,213670,10953820,"Posted: 29 June, 2014",all,huffadopolis,"Honestly?  It was like watching an episode of South Park happen in front of you, quite funny and exactly what you'd expect.But, the combat had that old super mario RPG (or was it paper mario?) 'if you hit A at the right point you get a bonus in combat' gimmick to it.  Every. Single. Attack. Except in this game most attacks required several timed button presses.  And it wasn't that they were hard to do, it was that the bonuses you got for performing the timed button presses was so great that not doing it wasn't an option.  It would have been much much better if regular attacks would have just done the bonus damage/effects without the button pressing and leave the special attacks for the extra button pushing.  That, I feel, would have been way more fun and 100% less tedious.  As is combat is just that, tedious but not difficult at all with the exception of a couple boss fights which just took a few tries was all.  Even those just required figuring out the gimmick/weakness and then they were easy also.Between that (which was neat at first, but once you saw it all and got the timing down it was like.. really?  forever it's gonna be like this?) and the never ending running back and forth between places you've seen/been/done I couldn't finish the game.  I got what I think was maybe 80% through before it wore me down.Needed more South Park Episode-ness and less what boiled down to repetitive fetch quests and combat to go along with it as the major filler between the good parts.6.5/10, storyline and cutscenes and voice-acting all gave the game the South Park feel but everything else failed to impress once you did the attack/special once, or saw the enemy's moves/sayings one time.  Loot was crappy too, you got a ton of useless♥♥♥♥♥♥ and no real customization because you always used 'the best' of what you had at the time there was no reason to choose anything else.edit: I'd like to add that I am bummed out to give this game a negative overall review, I had it on my wishlist and was so looking forward to playing this game for well over a year waiting for whatever caused it to be delayed for so long since it first showed up on steam's coming soon list"

Except it has the same depth of jokes, only spread out along an entire 20-30ish hour experience. Kind of feels like their company's first actual game (if you look beyond the horrible N64 SP games back in the day)-- it's definitely flawed and sloppy in some places. Little things that break immersion are rampant, like NPCs that only have one line that they repeat; frustrating instances like badly laid out tutorials for 'spells' that will loop the teaching part annoyingly; UI issues and more. It probably would have been a good idea for them to have condensed this down a bit-- there is a lot of variety in scenery and quests, but most become ye Olde Fetch/Kill Enemy nonsense. The loot system is clunky, as are many controls. The animation is up to par with the show, though, and you can SUPER customise your character. Unfortunately you can only be a boy, though you certainly can equip super femme and cute outfits and accessories.Basically, if you LOVE the show, you'll probably like it. The humour is the same, including some seriously problematic and cringeworthy jokes that weren't funny in the 00's. You'd have to be a diehard fan, because they reference/dredge up super old jokes that just don't work anymore. This feels like a warmup for their next game.Really, ONLY buy this if you're a MASSIVE fan of the show, and don't mind a game that's not very compelling gameplay-wise. You'd be better off just watching the show."

Every time you find a new better weapon or armor, it's only 1% better than the last. You're constantly replacing stuff with new stuff, finding out that everything kind of sucks. When you finally find a new area (Canada), you only spend a few minutes there. I quickly found the shops and bought a few better weapons, whoo hoo, and 5 minutes later they were replaced. I finally get cool armor at the end of the game, but the crap I bought in Canada was still better.

If SP humor doesn't offend you then have no fear that you will have a riot playing this.My only complaint - (using a 360 controller) When navigating menus and even during fights the controls would glitch occasionally.  In menus, it would act like I was holding down a direction on a stick/d-pad.  In fights/convos it would either not register a button press or give me 100 rapid fire presses.

Don't get me wrong, there are alot of laughs to be had here, but not for this price.Since it is $60, I need to consider that with my review. First, the RPG elements are too simple. The world, while cool, is entirely too small especially when considering other FF/$60 AAA RPGs. You are constricted to only walking on the sidewalk in a grid pattern that feels constraining. The combat is fun, but is really simple at its core. You are limited in many ways that would not bother me for half the price, but that is not the case. Most people comment on how short the game is - I don't care about the length of gameplay so much (at least not here), but I do care about content and originality.

I purchased this because of the positive feedback I had heard about it and because of who was behind it, but I just don't feel that it lived up to expectations. The game isn't well polished, it feels old, and the controls leave a lot (and I do mean a lot) to be desired, especially in combat. The interface, character system, and inventory system is stale and irritating, and the game itself doesn't feel quite put together and polished in a way that you would expect from a finished game, and the controls and interface remind me of a by gone era in gaming--especially with the bulls**t save system.After roughly two hours with this game it was already feeling repetitive and stale. I'm sure there is plenty more humor to be had and story to tell, but I just don't feel any motivation to actually spend any more time with it, I just wasn't enjoying myself. Part of me says I want to like it, while another part tells me that it just doesn't deliver the experience I expected or the quality I wanted.I'm glad that others seem to enjoy it, and maybe I will give it another go at some point, but honestly, right now I'm just not into the game."

The thing is right now I am writting this right after the release. The game has glitches, some features seem a little rushed, and some mechanics are simply broken. Its a great game other then that but until it is patched I can not recomment this game to any one.And example is that you move using WASD, as any other computer game. At parts there are sequences you have to follow using up down right left. You would assume thats WASD but you actually have to move your hand to the arrow keys. This will happen back and forth, without reason.When you walk around you collect ""Junk"" which are props from the show. You can sell this ""Junk"" at the vendor .... one piece at a time. There is no ""Sell all junk"" button. So you will end up with 35-50 pieces of junk between missions and then double click each and every one of them .... My god my hand hurts.Also my character blinks durring cut scenes, considering the simple graphics this should not happen. I run most games between high and ultra, no drivers out of date.So for 60 bucks you will get a game that desperatly needs a patch, wait until the patch, it will save your hand and hours of frustration."

This game is way more fun if you are already a South Park fan because of all the background music and sounds plus the character personalities.Unless you are absolutely desperate, wait until the price drops to at least $29.  Of course it has already been out for some time so im sure the desperate ones have already spent their $60+  I tried to wait it out but I ran out of games to play and was pretty bored, but I had a good time playing it.

,Recommended,213670,10409100,"Posted: 9 June, 2014",all,HeckinSweet,"First thing I thought about this game was that it wasn't going to be a normal game, the entertainment was going to lie in the jokes. I also thought this was an asinine, I mean that lovingly, attempt to breakthrough to a new audience. I was wrong on one of those points. This was not an attempt in any way to get gamers to start watching South Park. This game is for gamers who already like South Park. Now, before you argue with me, bear with me for a paragraph or two. South Park has been around for atleast a decade, Matt and Trey are very funny and a lot has happening in the world today.If they weren't making a game designed specifically for their audience, why would they put in so many in-jokes, old characters and throwbacks to seasons before? That would be a dumb way to make no fans, telling jokes they obviously aren't going to get, it makes the show seem un-funny. What if I came up to and told you an inside joke between my buddy and I, would you really want to talk to me? No, I've excluded you from my group of friends by saying something only my buddy and I would understand. It's not like South Park is a new show either.That's not saying they didn't come up with new jokes, though. Matt and Trey are smart writers, they've been writing for years and they've been able to give the new guy a chance. Just a small chance, it's still for fans. However, you can always count on this dynamic duo to bring some great satire to the table, which brings me to my last point.A lot has happened over a short time, I'm sure they could've poked fun at anything and made the game about that. So why didn't they? You know the answer, I've said a dozen times already. The point stands, if you're an SP fan, play this game, seriously."

I might take a swing at another class but I dont see it changing much.The humor is SO far over the top and in the gutter its almost unreal, so it will be a love it or hate it to most people.Its not all good though, there are some glaring weaknesses.What upsets me most is that they obviously spent so much time developing the play mechanics with such a variety of special moves, abilities, equipment and add-ons and varied damage types for your character and your companions but really didn't make much use of a lot of them.   The balance of powers in combat is seriously broken and simple to find easy mode.  I suspect that they ran out of time or money with the content and play balancing and just had to get it out the door.This is a bit of a spoiler, fyi.Combat is turn based which makes 3 specific things OP as all hell.  Speed potion (coffee), the SWAT team headgear found not even halfway into the main quest and anything that will deal frost damage.1 Initiate combat yourself so you get first attack.2 use speed potion so you get 2 attacks3 Use frost buffed weapon or ability to slow foe and cut their attack rate in half4 Second attack focus on the weakest opponent and likely kill them with a strong single focus attack.5 Swat headgear gives you another attack if you get a kill so you can chain this all the to an easy victory if you have a decent weapon and often not even need to use powers.6 Didn't kill them?  Ok, buddy gets a go...he can use coffee too so 2 more attacks for your side.7  Bad guys turn...wait, they are frosted so they will miss this turn, guess you and your buddy get to make another at least 4 more unanswered attack round then.That is broken.  No turn based combat should be gimped that easily.  Additional attack and opponent round skip things are just too powerful in this type of combat.   And of the DOT effect types in the game, fire, frost, shock, holy, bleeding and gross you really only need 1.Enemy defensive positions add the need to choose attack types wisely and was a good aspect but it feels like they forgot about the system in most battles, they rarely use them.I didn't find any reason to use any other buddy than anoying♥♥♥♥♥Jimmy because his special boost of free power points is just too good.  The only reason to switch out is for doing a buddy command outside of combat, which is itself very under used, hell...I dont even know the buddy command for Cartman, Stan or Kyle because they are never needed.Magic...farting that is...has no use in combat for the most part, I only used it for the final battle because its required.  Standard attacks/specials that don't use consumables are superior in combat all the way but they make a big deal about the aquisition of these spells as though they are a critical element.The bones of a great rpg system are here,  its a simple to use but decently deep system that doesn't feel overwhelming in character micro-management that bigger, more serious rpg's can be bogged down with.   They just don't put it to use well enough.It is well done though as far as feeling just like playing an NC-17 episode of the show and worth a play through for 10 buck or so.   Main quest can be blown through in short order, too short.  I got it on sale with the DLC but damned if I know what that added, guess I need to go read about it.Would love to see this rpg system adapted to other properties or even more south park and just balanced a bit better so you don't cheese your way through combat."

If you happen to love both then why are you reading this? Click on 'Add to cart' already you won't be disappointed.Characters: If you're familiar with South Park, as in watched a decent amount of episodes, then good news: you'll know every character already. And you'll love them all. If you've never watched South Park then that's a hurdle as characters don't really get much background. You'd be basically jumping into a game that doesn't really bother to explain to you the relationships or the personalities of these folks from a quiet little mountain town. You'd be put into a situation where they might be comical but you won't really get why.Gameplay: If you've played Paper Mario rpgs then you know how this game plays. It's a turn based title where whenever you do an action you have a chance to produce more/less damage based on prompts and actions. Which of course makes the whole turn based aspect of the game so much funner. You're put in the town of south park and you can walk around, visiting familiar sites and homes. You can initiate fights with enemies or entirely ignore them. The customization system is amazing, one of the more in-depth ones I've played in a game. If you don't like how your character looks it's not an issue as you're given different hairs, face accessories, glasses, armor, and weapons you can add to him. And they're all color customizable.Story: The story is basically a parody of standard RPG Fantasy tropes, mixed in with the typical on-the-nose satire found in South Park's writing. This means that you'll be laughing non-stop if you're familiar with either, even more with both.Presentation: the game has incredible presentation. Music, graphical, everything. Even the way the characters move. It feels like you're in a South Park episode, they got the look perfectly right.Humor: I'm extremely biased because I watch South Park religiously, but it's amazing. BUT NOT FOR EVERYONE. If you are easily disgusted or don't approve of profanity then I can't recommend this game. Because there will be profanity and gross situations all the time. A lot of sexual humor as well. The satire is brilliant of course, but you'll have to deal with the regular South Park humor throughout the whole game. So if you've seen the show and don't stand it, I cannot recommend the game.Over-all: One of the most fun games I've played in ages. This game was almost made for somebody like me. I love rpgs and love South Park, so the two joined into one? Yes please. Do yourself a favor and play it now.10/10"
,Recommended,213670,10929007,"Posted: 28 June, 2014",all,Lurgen,"I hardly ever review games, but for once thought this one deserved it.Games based on TV shows and movies rarely satisfy me. They usually fail to capture whatever it is about the original that made it so great. South Park somehow manages to avoid this, and stays completely faithful to the TV show.This has to be one of the best TV to game ports I've ever played. It feels like an interactive TV episode, retains all the original (remaining) voice actors, and plays really well. The jokes are funny, the content offensive, and the gameplay interesting. Despite being a turn-based combat system it never feels slow or clunky (unlike the last couple of Final Fantasy games) and mixes the enemy types up enough to keep things interesting.It isn't a long game though, you should be done in 10-15 hours if you take your time and find most of the hidden content, and I would not consider it at all difficult. It is definitely worth playing if you're a South Park fan.Warning: Australian customers get a nerfed version of the game, with objectionable material removed and replaced with a crying koala (no kidding). This is easily reversed once you buy it with a simple patch that you can find in the forum. The content isn't critical to the game or story line and is possible justified in being removed but since it's easily restored you can make your own mind up."

Throw South Park's irreverent humour,  wacky settings and characters and you have this full of laughs game .I liked that you could open a characters closet and see great references to TV series past episodes.  The combat abilities of each of the characters do a great job of representing the characters’ established personality.  Lots of loot, usually with a humourous description.As far as RPG’s go, the combat is interesting but not particularly difficult.   I would recommend playing on Hard.There are some really over the line situations but it’s to be expected from the creators of South Park.If you enjoy South Park and/or have a, less than innocent, sense of humour you will enjoy this game."

Each turn in combat has a quick-button element to it that is actually used in a way as to make the fighting fun and engaging. You can't just zone out and mash your same attacks like in WoW, nor can you rely on the same patterns over and over like in final fantasy. For this reason alone, I found the game was fun enough to warrant a full playthrough.The story reminds me of what I would expect from a south park movie. It's rude and crass, but that's what makes it south park and not some other set of characters. I didn't find it any more or less shocking than the movie or episodes specifically, but it just lacked the censoring, much like the movie."

Game.  Okay...For starters, if you have kept up with the show from start to, oh say about to season 10... maybe less... you'll notice they've stuffed about every imagineable reference/character/tree/fart that they could into a single game platform.  I can't think of a single character they left out, and the one's you don't see or interact with, are referenced by the dozens of filler characters across Colorado/Canada.You're playing an episode of South Park.  Matt and Trey know exactly what they were doing and brought all the same quirky, fart-filled fun from the TV directly to your fingertips.  Did I mention it's not on television, so they can get away with whatever the hell they want?  Well now I did.I'm geeking out just trying to put my thoughts into words.The gameplay returns you to the old school, classed-based style of turn-based RPGs, armor, and equipement.  Seeking to become the new cool kid in town, you're accompanied by a fellow companion, which can be any number of kids in South Park, all with their own unique ability to interact with the world.If you love South Park, this is a must buy.

South Park: The Stick of Truth is a great game and a must have for fans of the series or those that like a little lite RPG action (and can handle the game poking fun at them and it's self).  The humor is great, the pacing of the game is perfect and it is just plain clever from begining to end.  I never once felt any scene or mission drag on too long or get bored with what I had to do.South Park is was on of the best games I've played in a long time, and you can clearly see the care and creativity that went into designing and bringing this game to life.  Some may find the length of the game an issue (I finished in 23 hours), but the content, joy, and laughs I got while getting to the last battle were well worth the price of admission.

,Recommended,213670,9682651,"Posted: 30 March, 2014",all,Marzop&&,"Overall, I thought the game was great. However, with a few minor additions, I think the game could have gone from ""great"" to ""game of the year."" I would have liked to have seen the game expanded even further. Throughout the game, the player comes across three different alternate settings, specifically the alien ship, Canada, and Mr. Slave's butt. These additional settings gave the player a break from the town, which is where the main story resides. Each alternate setting/chapter has unique enemies and gear that the player can use. Given the storyline, I don't know how they could have incorporated other settings/chapters, but I would have enjoyed additional content like a chapter dedicated to hell or Imaginationland.I acquired access to the high-level weapons from Jimbo's Guns about 75% through the game. Once I had these two weapons, the gameplay went much quicker. I don't know if that was good or bad, but even the final boss fight was a breeze...using Butters as my buddy through the battle.I found the initial combat training, under Cartman, to be the most frustrating part of the game. I couldn't get the timing right and had to redo each excercise 5 or 6 times. I also found the magical fart training a bit frustrating, until I figured out the trick behind it. Overall, I had a great experience with the game and it had some good LOL moments. I just wish it was a bit longer."

,Recommended,213670,9683267,"Posted: 30 March, 2014",all,Demonseed Elite,"South Park, The Stick of Truth is the closest I've ever come to living in a cartoon.  I'm a big fan of South Park, having watched more or less every episode, and even then, I was apprehensive about picking up this game.  Why? Because games done off popular shows generally fail hard.  Regardless, I gave it a shot, and was glad I did.  It is essentially playing in an episode of South Park, and it is every bit as hilarious as the show.The game is hysterically funny, creative, fresh and absolutely entertaining.  The game play is typical JRPG turn based combat... why, because Cartman says ""I know it's dumb, but that's just how they fought back then"".  Perfect explanation if there ever was one.  Sounds exactly like the kind of moronic thing Cartman would say in any episode of the show, and it fits perfectly.To any fans of South Park, I highly recommend this game.  The writing, story, music, effects are all top-notch AAA effort.  It took me 22.5 hours to get through and it was money well spent.  Kudos to Trey Parker, Matt Stone and Obsidian Entertainment for an amazing and wild ride.  I've been a part of the South Park universe and I hope for a sequal so I can go back again."

76561198127453864,Recommended,213670,9658522,"Posted: 28 March, 2014",all,Baron_Machina,"Gotta say, after playing The Stick of Truth, I hope that they NEVER make another South Park game without Trey Parker and Matt Stone's heavy influence on its development. Stick of Truth is literally everything that you could want from a South Park game, and actually is great in it's own right as well. The game is literally filled with references from the show (and I don't just mean that figuratively: the main characters' closets are LITERALLY filled with references). I also love the game's story, being about kids role playing as fantasy warriors and having imaginary wars with each other over ""whoever controls the universe"". It captures this set up perfectly, and kinda makes me miss the days when I did this as a kid. The whole plot also makes it so that you don't necesarily have to be a huge fan of the show to get the plot, since your character is a new kid in South Park and all the other characters treat you as such. However, non-fans will unfortunately not get all of the references and obscure characters from the show. Also, as expected from South Park, the writing is freaking hilarious, having laugh out loud joke after laugh out loud joke with no decrease in quality. The crudeness that was so upfront and hilarious from the show is back and better than ever, to the point where I'd even say it's more crude than Conker's Bad Fur Day.And I have to say, making your own character and exploring the world of South Park is awesome. There is quite a bit of visual customization so if you really want to, you can recreate yourself as a South Park kid. The visuals really bring the South Park experience to full effect, with everything looking and moving exactly like the show. Also, exploring the town of South Park is a lot of fun, with tons of different areas all from the show like the School and the houses of the main cast. You also get to meet so many characters from the show, like Mr. Garrison, Randy Marsh, Al Gore, and Jesus. The developers wanted to create the ultimate immersive South Park experience, and they nailed it perfectly.The combat is also a lot of fun, taking inspiration from action RPGs like the Mario RPGs (Paper Mario and Mario and Luigi specifically). The game uses action commands in order to effectively attack to increase your attacks' damage or block to decrease incoming damage. You also get to pick from one of six characters from the show to serve as your battle partners, who can be swapped out at will mid battle. Out of all of the partners, I personally found Butters and Kyle to be the most useful. You also get to pick from one of four classes, Fighter, Mage, Rogue, and Jew (let's face it, you all laughed when you first heard that, as did I XD). Each has their own unique abilities in battle, such as the mage ""casting spells"" by using regular objects, like waving a sparkler in someone's face until they catch fire (so wonderfully BRUTAL). You can equip your character with a wide arrangement of weapons and equipment you find or buy ingame, each with their own stats and effects. You can also earn perks that give your character permanent status effects by gaining friends in South Park and adding them on your ingame Facebook page. I gotta say, though, the game is pretty easy, even on hardcore mode, so don't expect this to be that challenging of a game. Also, in terms of RPG standards, the game is pretty short. Side quests included, the game should take you about 11-12 hours. Even though the combat is easy and the game is a bit short, it's still is a ton of fun to play.All in all, South Park Stick of Truth is a great game. It may have a few flaws, but it's easily forgiveable for it's strategic yet engaging gameplay, it's laugh out loud storyline, it's and expertly and loyally crafted atmosphere. If your a fan of the show, this is a must have. If you don't know the show much but your a fan of RPGs, I think you'll still get a lot of enjoyment out of it."

It is as funny and as offensive as anything you have seen on the show or in the movie. There was never a point in the game where I wasn't laughing at something the kids said or did. Yes, the gameplay and combat are not extremely difficult to master, but the point of the game was to tell a story. This is how the game stays so appealing (Mainly through the fact that every cut scene and character interactions looks and feels like you are controlling an episode). Hell, they even mock the concepts of turn based RPGs throughout the game. By the end, all that matters is finishing the epic story.2) Don't play this around anyone who may get offended by the humor of South Park. Seriously, don't play this around parents, teachers, priests, etc. Unless you want your parents organizing together and blaming Canada for today's morally corrupted youths, then I suggest you play this only around others who share your sense of humor.

It happens to have a South Park theme, which is quite amusing in its own right. If you're squeamish, don't play this game. It gets grosser and grosser the further you get in the main quest chain.The classes feel more or less the same - they all do about the same damage, the abilities are only different in color and text. The buddies that you choose to help you for a fight have more differences than the class that you picked. There was a spot in the main quest line that I thought wasn't really playtested properly, but overall, it's a reasonably polished game.I liked the different ways you can handle enemies, if you don't want to fight them all, you don't have to. It's a game that calls for a certain amount of lateral thinking.Is it worth $60? Dunno. If you're a rabid South Park fan, it probably is.

If you are a big fan of South Park, as I am, then surely you will enjoy The Stick of Truth and what is has to offer. If you don't care to involve yourself with games involving talking poo, becoming facebook friends with Al Gore to become united against ManBearPig, fighting a crossdressing princess under the supervision of a a nude elderly man, and becoming afflicted with Dire AIDS, then this game might not be up your alley. NOTE: this game is not for the easily offended.The turn-based battle system is fun, there are just enough different moves to keep things interesting (though I would love to see more moves/variation). The story is great, it's like watching an episode of the show that goes on for 10 hours. The side missions, collectibles, and other various ""extra"" features of the game kept me busy during my second playthrough and kept me interested enough to finish that playthrough. Unfortunately there is not much variation between the 4 classes, so there is very little replay value - don't expect the game to ""feel"" any different when you play a different class, everyone can use all the same weapons and armor only the special moves are different (each class has 5 special moves, unlocked as you progress through the game).My major complaint about The Stick of Truth: there is not enough content to justify the $60 price tag. One could beat this game to 100% completion in under 20 hours, which is actually a generously high estimate. I haven't heard any talk of expansions at this point in time, so while I do love this game I'm also upset with myself for dropping $60 on it.FINAL VERDICT: This game is a must-have for any South Park fan, BUT you should wait for it to go on sale or come down in price.

I know the idea is to beat the main story.. and even all the side quests.. and then build another guy and go back to finish all the acheivements, but this game almost requires you to do that.

76561197973938427,Recommended,213670,9556294,"Posted: 18 March, 2014",all,Shamus the Idiot Shark,"Now I'm gonna base this on the fact that the game hasn't had any downloadable content released yet seeing as it is a new game. The creators of South Park first of all I really appreciate putting the time and effort to release a stand-out game. Usually I'm not playing RPG's that often but this is definitly a good direct path towards one whether or not you play RPG's often.You make your own character who you build him up based on strange quests from fighting AIDS filled bears, to finding a♥♥♥♥♥♥♥for Mr. Slave (a character from the show) and there are several points where you have to choose between two options throughout the game. The weapons and special attacks are recognizable and definitly to take notice as well based on the four class choices (warrior, mage, theif, jew) and your team mates (who you only choose one to follow and join you in battle) who each have different power attacks to help aid you.The controls might come off as a little annoying and different at first with the combat system but it's easily learned and you'll definitly build a foundation on it. The storyline, let's face it it's South Park you're not gonna be disapointed and there are several scenes throughout the game that it comes off as disgusting, slightly controversial and overall a funny game. The creators did a great job making it feel like you're playing a game but also make it feel like you're watching an episode (or movie) of the show.This game also builds a lot of nostalgia for prior episodes written from the characters you run into, the strange songs that were composed and even if you never watched the show it puts you in a perspective still that you don't need to watch the show to get the references, just know they're ♥♥♥♥ed up like the show is (and Jesus Christ it's funny as hell.)And like I said earlier in regards that there's no DLC for this game yet, my ONLY complaints are the price of this game in regards to the amount of time it took me to beat the game. Most RPG games you'd imagine take a LONG time to beat, in this one I found myself not unlocking even half the perks and abilities that were available for my character (and I beat every quest) and the game was actually rather quick. Some enemies were not difficult to face (In all honesty I'd recommend hardest difficulty for this game) and sometimes you want to try all the special weapons but sometimes by the time you get them you already have one that's majorly better than it.Overall I give this game a 3.5/5, the replay value is still extraordinarily good and if you're familiar with South Park you'll find yourself engulfed in the game but this is a game I'd recommend if you're JUST starting to play RPG style games but also looking for the entertainment value. I don't think the game deserves a price tag of $60... and in major hopes that the DLC's for this game extend the main quest or add more time consuming obstacles I just found the game very short. Overall great game, but at the moment I'd wait for a Steam Sale or at least a credibly extensive DLC to be released."

,Recommended,213670,9567453,"Posted: 19 March, 2014",all,nobody,"(Summary: well executed and largely captures the spirit of the show, has some flaws, can only recommend to the most hardcore fans at this price, even casual fans should put it on their wishlist so they're notified when it gets a price break)I've gone casual over the past few seasons but still enjoy watching the show from time to time.  I'd still call myself a big fan, and as a fan, I can tell you we've tolerated quite a few bad games themed after South Park (the boring FPS, the annoying pinball machine, a cash-grab tower defense game).  It's not lightly when I say that this is without a doubt the best use of the property in a game.  This shows that it is possible to build a game around a license and really nail the tone.  The characters here are fully voiced (except for the player character who is subjected to several running gags as a silent protagonist -- a great decision on behalf of the writers), and their interactions are exactly what you'd expect from the show.  Other times, the ""edgy"" gags can feel a bit forced, unnecessary and often cringe-worthy.  It reminded me how the creators of South Park talk highly about their self-enforced ""censorship"" because it prevents them from using the first and most obvious thought that comes to mind.  Overall, though, I think the game gets more right than wrong, so I won't belabour the point.The game script suffers a few flaws.  At one point in the story, you free a captured character to advance the storyline, but because I couldn't figure out how to open an elevator (due to an interaction that wasn't explained very well), I thought I'd missed something.  I set off revisiting the areas I had just cleared where I could review monitors that showed animations of the character I'd just rescued, still trapped and pleading with me to free him.  Obviously, this is confusing to a player, and I thought I'd ""broken the game"".  No, it was just that the designers had forgotten to wall off that area or disable the monitors.  I was able to progress once I figured out how to trigger the elevator.  There's a few interaction problems like this in the game, but they are thankfully few.You'll encounter some ""side quests"" you can't immediately complete because, unknown to you, they will become part of the storyline.  For example, I thought it'd be fun to befriend the goth kids; they're accessible from the opening moments of the game, and they even tell you exactly what you need in order to gain their approval.  But the items and events needed to progress here don't become available to you until much later.  And in retrospect, I see no reason why I couldn't have completed those tasks earlier.  This alone might be a minor concern, but this isn't the only time something like this happens.  If you choose to deviate from the storyline and go do some other tasks, prepare to have your time wasted because you never really know which quests you can actually accomplish at the moment.These are pretty common complaints about these kinds of ""open world"" games, but knowing that the game was delayed several times, it would be expected that these issues would have been identified and worked out.  Still, we've tolerated far worse in the past.  Is it worth $60 to run around in this universe while putting up with some minor problems?  If you're not convinced, I'd implore you to at least put it on your wishlist and grab it when it's on sale."

Pretty decent South Park atmosphere, lots and lots of references to different episodes of the show, a handful of very provocative jokes, interesting main storyline and side-quests, exciting battle system, great amount of places to explore, characters to interact with and bizzare things to do.There are few drawbacks though. Most of the battles are way too simple even in the hardcore mode despite the fact that the battle system is overall good and has its potential. Also the game has many QTE episodes, and some of them could be very anoying. I ended up using the gamepad for this game, but there was one or two moments where I had to partly switch to keyboard to complete the necessary QTE. Also the storyline is rather linnear. If you prefer to thoroughtly explore the game world during the first playthrough you'll find not much to do during the second one.But, to repeat myself, I enjoyed my time with this game very much. Besides all South Park things, it also reminded me the good old days of my childhood and those great street games we played with friends. I hope there'l be many gameplay DLCs for this one. I would return to this world once again with great pleasure!"

It's vulgar, it's offensive, it's hilarious, just like South Park should be. The battle mechanics does get a bit stale over time. I wouldn't fault it too much on this game as I feel this is how turn based RPGs tend to be. You find a strategy that works for you and do the same optimal sequence of moves every fight.

There's plenty of nostalgic elements for South Park fans and RPG fans alike, and like any great South Park episode, the game never ceases to push the boundaries on what could possibly be included in a media product without getting censored or banned (poor Germany).I highly recommend this game, it is one of the only times I have sat playing a game with a smile consistently on my face and the game causing me to laugh hysterically on a number of occasions.

Yes, because the storyline this game features is phenomenal, The downside of this game is that if you're a casual gamer you could beat the storyline in under 1-2 days maybe hours depending on your skill level.

Finding out Butters was my first new friend in town was just the cherry on top. Even being placed in the role of ""silent protagonist"" felt funny again simply because of how often South Park pokes fun at conventional RPG tropes over the course of the game.I ended up playing through the game three times. While I would like to say it's because it's so amazingly well done and fun that I just had to replay it a few times, but to be honest a lot of it was because I'm a completionist and finding every friend you can make in South Park is actually FRUSTRATINGLY tough. This is especially so since it depends on you completing a SEPARATE collection of Chinpokomon, BOTH of which can be missed out on by overlooking them in temporarily available areas! That, and playing through it once felt pretty fast.Plus, the combat system started wearing thin towards the end of the first playthrough since it often just came down to using your favorite super move as quickly and frequently as possible. Beyond that, prioritizing PP recuperation and ongoing damage (broken bottle ftw) helped me stroll through the game with minimal challenge.Stick of Truth is full of great references though, whether it's the classic aliens or Hasselhoff or crab people. Honestly, after seein some of the concept art, I wish the nighttime scenarios were more robust. Still, there's no denying that The Stick of Truth allowed me to happily roleplay alongside the cast and characters of South Park on one of their insane adventures."

Some of the bosses are sometimes a bit too easy. Especially later in the game and you have done a lot of roaming before completing the main storyline. I sometimes find myself in a position in which i can defeat a boss in just 5 rounds.The jokes in the game are very good and you will see a lot of things that are used in the tv series. Although i must say that the alien part sometimes get a bit too far but hé that's why it's south park ;)Anyway it's a good game and real fun to play. they have done a lot of effort and you can see that ingame.

I haven't felt this emotionally invested in a game in a long time where I wanted to lose sleep to play it.I loved playing this game, but....by the end I felt a huge sense of loss.-The game caps your level on a weird number. Most RPG's usaully cap you at 99 or 100 if they are epic in length, or a good solid round number (20,30,50 etc). This one was 15, and you're usually not even close to the end by the time it happens. Not to mention it prevents you from maxing out your abilities which really erked me when I came to that realization.-The game doesn't take a long time to beat or (my guess) fully complete. I've heard some people speed through it in 12 hours and some can take all the way up to 20 if they are completionists. I think I got through it in 16 casually playing it.My silver lining hope is that the creators are going to be releasing more content later (hopefully free) to make you want to play through it again and so that we don't feel gipped from paying $60 for a very short adventure.Verdict:At full price the game has you craving more content.But the content it does have is completely magical.Video games nowadays have lost a certain spark that made them really fun to play, and this game has that spark in spades."

Towards the end I felt like I just had to get it done and didn't want to do the side quest and complete it. I wish I could have upgraded my party members or give them armor/weapons at least.

If you are fan of South Park this game is a need to play even if turn-based games arent your thing just based on how much of a love baby(ora nazi fetus) of the show this game was.

I have not laughed so hard at a game, nor have a found myself so imersed in a game is such a long time. The only negatives i have about this game are 1)The map lay out isnt always helpful, it might be because i have been spoilt with the likes of WoW and so on where the map actually helps you along, becides an arrow pointing to where you are  and a exclamation mark to your target of a target, i sometimes found my self just walking right past where i need to be. 2) Though this a lovely PC port (one of the better ones out there i might add) Not being able to rebind your keys is alittle annoying and to be honest a bit silly not having that option. Enough of my whining, all the nods to old episodes and in jokes are in there, all the characters, the combat is brillient, with some of the most off the wall special movies, you can just smell the magic ;-).

I also re-equipped my items more times then i could count.But even with all these issues the game is amazing i tried with a game pad and all the cutscenes glitched out so i stuck with keyboard and mouse. the lack of replay value and the large amount of achievements that may take multiple playthroughs made me dislike it more then i should have.Overall 9/10"

I think it's quite funny, but I rarely watch more than a couple of episodes a year. So I wasn't too sure if I would like this game or not, and in the end I found that I loved this game! It's unbelievable crude, but that's okay. They handle it in a way that all the sick humor feels like it's there for a reason rather than just there for shock value. The game play is pretty solid too. All in all I had a good time with this game.One of the biggest draws to the game is that it was written by the show's writers and voiced by the entire cast. If that hadn't been true this game probably would have sucked quite a bit more. Mostly because without the clever cast and writing the game couldn't have held my attention as long as it did. The plot is... weird, but fun. And in the end that's what is important.The gameplay caught me by surprise. I'm not going to say that it was stupendous. Because it wasn't. I found myself spamming quite a few attacks over and over again. It's a good thing that some of them are so much fun to use (like anything from Princess Kenny or the Thief's final ability). The game could have stood for a little bit more variety with the combat. It holds up for the duration of the game, but by the end I was kind of sick of seeing the same moves over and over again.Honestly the most entertaining thing for me was finding as many costume pieces as I could. I had fun dying the pieces and mixing and matching them. There is a huge variety of pieces and the depth of the dress-up mechanic really makes me sad that you HAVE to play as a boy. I would love to see an update to the game that let's you start out as a girl and work up the political backstabbing. It would be a way of retelling the plot from a fun perspective. At least I think that would be fun.All in all I enjoyed this game. I don't see myself coming back to replay it over and over again, but I don't regret the purchase at all. It was a very fun time that I had trouble pulling myself away from."

This game has easily been more fun and immersive than any other game that has come out this year.I haven't beaten it all the way through and I do worry about replayability a bit due to the large portion of story driven content.However, the RPG itself is very deep and fun to play as a game itself. The lack of a user interface is done well for once and it seriously plays like (several) episodes of South Park. I found myself enjoying the combat thoroughly!I usually only buy things on humble bundle or if I will play them for a long time. I do not regret paying the full 60 for this one.That really, really says something.Be aware though, some countries have anal retentive demolition man government policy and so they won't be able to experience this game as the whole piece of art it is. If you are in those countries, I am doubting the game will be boring because of the changes (It is literally impossible to ruin this game even with a slight bit of creepy spying old guys in suits censorship) but that is something you may want to consider if you live in CensorShipistan or EasilyOffendedVille.Myself, I am able to experience the full game and from what I have seen... Every bit of effort and care has been given to make the game an actually enjoyable experience. They did not rely on fans to buy it simply because they are fans. They wanted the game to stand on its own two feet. The npc dialogue is reactive to what you do, the game does not tend to keep you from doing something you want to do unless it has good reason and I found myself immersed in the South Park universe.Although it is story driven, the ""plot twists"" are not toooo obvious and the game feels as crazy as South Park does.This is a solid 10/10 singleplayer experience and I suspect that if you were to stream it for some friends or let them watch on the couch... A good time will be had by all involved."

The humor, graphics and voices are spot-on and it was like watching and playing in an entire extra season of the show.  Some parts are exactly as predictable as you'd expect and other parts are very creative.As an RPG game, it's pretty poor... progressions is very fast and is basically a war of escalation.  Either you can kill your enemies without them scratching you, or they can do the same to you.  Not much in between and very little room for strategy.The game's mechanics are confusing also; it has strange quicktime elements and what you do in a fight doesn't match what you are told to do in tutorial areas.  For instance, to use a Magic Spell (fart), they instruct you to do all manner of finagling with the mouse and arrow keys.  But when a fight comes, the instructions flash past and they are inexplicably different.  Simpler, yes, but still vastly different.No replayability here... a great game but nothing there to make you want to play again.  I played as a warrior and didn't get the feeling any other class would present much new gameplay.

I really enjoy the customization system that goes along with everything, if you wear something you can change it's colors. I look forward to DLC for this game, that is something I rarely say. Other than that, I would say turn it up to hardcore if you are a veteran of RPGs and the challenge is suffient. The humor in this game is like bigger longer and uncut in it's truest form. It brings me back to older RPGS and it has some fun adventure elements that I think are charming. My only con is that I wish you could have more interaction on the ""facebook"" and that is a very small one at that."

But you knew that going in, and that's part of what attracts people to southpark.  Nazi Zombies?  Stuttering?  Token african americans?  Self made abortions?   It's all here.All of that said, what isn't here is an effective control system.   Playing the game on an I7-4770, 290X Video + QDH (2560x1440) it looks beautiful, but the controls are out of whack in a way that doesn't impact any other game I play.. the game seems to respond to controllers (I use the XBOX360 Controller for windows) in a way that seems either slow or just.. wrong.   Making the game very difficult to play, even on casual levels.   I've tried editing some settings, but adjusting to the timing is.. not really something that is consistent.  This is a downfall from someone who had no problem grabbing up time at Tomb Raider, Dishonored and other games.. but here, simple tasks can be downright daunting as a button press on my keypad seems to take forever to come into place in the game.The game has a big problme here in that it's all or not; you're on the controller or the keyboard, there is no option to switch back and forth between the two, and the game doesn't provide you any options to reset the key layout for those of us who have seperate keypads.   That said, it's quite fun and I'll remain hopeful that an update provides for these issues."

You may feel that the time it takes to complete the game is rather short but I believe a few of us have been spoiled with the likes of Skyrim and Mass Effect.  Every single second of this game is enjoyable and fresh!All in all, the developers of this game may have been poking fun at RPGs in general, but they seem to have made quite a good one in the process.

Although as an RPG, it is fairly simplistic, and not terribly challenging, as a South Park game, it is awesome.  It brilliantly captures the best part of the show: boys being boys.  You can find references to just about every episode in the shows history somewhere in the game, and finding them is a big part of the games charm.  It’s obvious that Parker and Stone took full advantage of the M rating, and in some countries, whole sections of the game got banned.  Let’s just say that that by the end of the game, you’ll understand how lemmiwinks must feel.  It’s not a long game, with a full play-through around 15-20 hours, but there’s certainly enough variety of choices and play styles to warrant a second time through."

It's worth every last penny you have. A great ride, and no shortage of F-bombs make this my Pick of the Year."

GET IT NOW!and now on to the rest of this review. You play the role of a New silent Kid in Southpark. This game play's out like any episode of South Park minus the fact it is actually a game that you control. I honestly can't stop playing this game because it will always get you laughing with a few jokes from the TV series and many other jokes that make major References to other Entertainment sources.Mostly starting off the game does play off that of a Turn based Strategy game, but you still have to block/defend and attack with in the combat event's once you start the battles, but still it is a turn based so no rush if your suddenly distracted by something in real life that wasn't scared away by the comedy that is South Park. The game will throw you a curve ball plenty of times during the combat, so make sure you are prepared before you venture out.I have just completed the game, and it has been a very complicated game play especially depending on the character build you wish to select. The Leveling system for the game is based on Armor and Weapons, with the key of the combat is based in how you build up your character before the fights. If you are planning to go into this game and just play it at hacking at everything with out using any special skills or abilities your game play will be VERY long leading up to the end of the game.If you are a Fan of Comedy, and the RPG experiences then this is the perfect game for you, if you dis-like the South Park TV series or was never a fan for any of the season of the show... then this game is probably not for you.Warning: This is rated M for a reason and the developers pushed this game to the Adult Rating, but still managed to keep it some what Mature.I found it very hard to write this review with out spoiling the Story but as I am writing this I have a new game que'd up to play through it again... can't get enough of it."

The turn based style combat mixed with the unique combo requirments for every move make it feel like Mario RPG. The world feels deeper by use of it's Metroidvania way of breaking up each location.

Just when you think it cannot get any more ridiculous it throws something else your way and its hilarity all over again. All your favorite characters are here in some form or another, and the entire game plays like a long episode of the show.The combat while not the deepest I have experienced in an RPG, is still deeper that it appears on the surface, and is more than adequate to carry this game along. The special abilities of your party members are fun to watch and many are taken straight from past episodes of the show.The game length may turn a few people off, I expect 12 - 16 hours for most people to play through the story, and after the credits roll you are plopped back into the game so you can finish off any remaining side quests and try for achievements.If you are a fan of the show, you should not pass this up.And remember, you must never, under any circumstances, fart on another mans balls."

Once I got started playing this I found my fears are unfounded. It's honestly like playing a really really extended episode of the show. You honestly never really need to grind at all though I'm not sure on that totally since I spent a LOT of time doing the side quests and comparing myself to a lot of playthroughs I've seen I was about two three levels stronger than the average.My one grip about the game is that it is way waaay too short. I started playing roughly ten in the morning and had beaten the game by the end of that night. I really don't think sixty dollars is worth the price tag but it is a truely entertaining game that will really give you something to do if you're bored and have nothing to do.I would wait for the price to go down or a sale to happen first though.

The narrative is essentially equivalent to a full season of the show and possibly goes even more overboard then the show at times.  In typical South Park fashion it first toes the line of what is politically correct then steps over it and starts sprinting.  Lets just say nazi zombie aborteed fetuses and leave it at that.  In the end the combat is fairly simplistic and at times feels quite easy but the combat is simply used as a means to tell the story.If you are a fan of the series you will enjoy the game its like getting a whole new season that happens to be connected together throughout with a dizzying number of references to boot.  I would definitely recommend a buy if you are even a casual fan of the series, if you dislike the series do not buy the game and complain about the humor it is typical south park humor taken even more over the top at times.

This game was really hard to put down from the day I picked it up until the night I topped off the last achievement.  The Stick of Truth combines South Park's unique animation style and raunchy humor with traditional fantasy and RPG tropes and hits all three pretty head on.The game does have its flaws, such as a large number of permanently missable items, frustrating tutorials that don't accurately reflect gameplay, and an unskippable cutscene of Jimmy stuttering that lasts over a minute.

Soooooo funny. You can tell the people at south park studios were involved and the dev team were huge fans. There are more references and throwbacks in here than a seth mcfarlane show (but used the right way instead of being THE JOKE to focus on and just mixed into the background or as items) some of which go all the way back to the very first season. You even have the old chinpokomon as collectibles.Even the sounds are great. From the chatter of the towns people or your battle buddies down to the music, walking into a building to look for extras and hearing let's fighting love play over the speaker, or even just the actual weapons and abilities, it's all great.My only complaint was it felt too short. Even after doing just about everything (permanently missed one chinpokomon and had some random gear and collectibles I missed) it was only about 10-11 hours total.

Pop culture franchises are rarely good games, so my expectations were pretty low. But still, this game managed to impress me. The Final Fantasy style turned-based combat is very simple and shallow, and rarely a challenge, but that's OK. The real reason to play is to find amusing collectibles and enjoy great writing.As far as the plot goes, don't ever assume you know where the story is going. It's really well written to have the kind of surreal absurdity that South Park excels at. And the dialog and situations are just amazing. Hands down the most innovative, and disturbing, boss fight I've ever seen in a video game. All in all, great fun."
