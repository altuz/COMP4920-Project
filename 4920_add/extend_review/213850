,Recommended,213850,18855215,"Posted: 3 November, 2015",all,CoryStarkiller,"This version doesn't have the best base game decks.This version doesn't have the best DLC decks.This version is still the best Magic The Gathering game to buy on Steam.How can this be?Magic 2014 has the best modding community for any of the Magic games on Steam.http://www.slightlymagic.net/forum/viewforum.php?f=109You can get all the decks from 2010, 2012, 2013, and even a few from 2015 in this game for free. Also, there are lots of other custom decks and custom cards that have been made. If you don't like what the community has made, there are great modding tools to make your own cards/decks. Installation of the mods couldn't be easier, because it is nothing more than drag and drop.All of the modded decks can be used in online play(assuming your opponent also has the modded deck you are using). There is even an online community focused on playing with modded content, so you will be able to find an opponent, even when using the unofficial content.The actual gamemodes are more of the same from the previous games in the series. The new gamemode is ""Sealed"" play, which is a total ripoff and should be ignored after you use your base game plays. Sealed is not enough like the IRL counterpart, to justify actually spending money on those DLC.There are lots of purely cosmetic DLC, in the form of Foil Cards. They are completely pointless, aside from looking shiny. There is even an option to disable seeing the Foil skins on the cards that other people use, if you dislike their inclusion in the game. There is also a bunch of Deck Key DLC, which is nothing more than ""skip the grinding"" DLC. The Deck Key DLC should be skipped, as you can just use Cheat Engine, a Trainer, or sharing a gamesave to get all the cards without having to spend money or hours grinding.The only DLCs that are worth buying are the Expansion Pack, and Deck Packs 1-3, since these are expanding the content of the game. Expansion Pack adds 5 more decks, and adds more content to the base game's gamemodes. Deck Packs 1-3 each add 2 more decks to the game. These 4 DLC give you slightly more than double the number of decks of the base game.  Luckily, Stainless Games has given the bundled option of all 4 of these DLC with the base game for a cheaper price than buying them separately. This bundle is called Gold Game, and is going to be the wisest way to purchase this game now.Magic 2014 is more than just a dumb nerd game. There is a surprising amount of depth to playing, without the need to buy dozens of IRL cards. Easy to learn, hard to master.As an added bonus, you can enter promotional codes to get some extra cards for all 21 decks. I had to enter each of the codes a few times to get them to properly unlock the extra cards, but they will unlock with a few tries. Check the ""Problems"" section if you are unable to get the promotional codes to work.http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=170231686If that guide does not work, the excellent modding community I mentioned before has found another work around for getting the promotional cards.http://www.slightlymagic.net/forum/viewtopic.php?f=62&t=10898"

Which I was okay with.All I wanted was the ability to build my own decks with the new ""Sealed Deck"" Gametype and duel the computer. Maybe let the computer play one of my own decks. That would be cool, too.But that wasn't happening. You can only play ""Sealed Deck"" twice until you have to buy new slots for your custom decks. No deleting decks allowed. After you draw your boosters, those boosters are locked to your acccount, and you can't shake them or Re-draft (Start from scratch). You have to buy more slots from WoTC. This is a money grab, plain and simple.When I dug into it, I found out their reasoning was for ""Online Play"", they didn't want people to sit around and re-roll decks to get the perfect combination and head to the top of the Online Ladder, so they locked cards in place. But then they let you re-roll decks anyway, however you have to ""Buy Slots"". Which means, people will still be doing the same thing -- sitting around and re-rolling decks to get the perfect cards. The only difference? They have to shell out three bucks everytime they do it, now. So, we can clearly see why they put this mechanism into place.Which is the dumbest part. I suck at programming, but I know a monkey could seperate online from offline play and let me reroll my sealed decks, even if its just against the computer. But, they opt not to. Because they want your money.I'm not joking when I say I beat the Single Player campaign within an afternoon (3 hours), and when I found out I couldn't Re-Roll decks, I uninstalled this application and rebooted MTG 2012. It's a more solid / balanced game with more fun decks, and Planechase is Worlds Better than the current iteration of Sealed Deck.Try again, Wizards. Nobody wants to play a MtG game where they are paywalled for building decks. That is what this game is about. Building decks and taking them apart. Why are you preventing us from doing what the very foundation of this game is about? That's like telling a Kenyan Runner he has to complete the 400m dash, but you hack his legs off and charge him if he wants to use them. What is the sense in that?Lunatics."

,Not Recommended,213850,8147620,"Posted: 20 December, 2013",all,Emporor Penguin,"My Opinion: While Magic 2014: Duels of the Planeswalkers greatly improves on the mechanics of the previous games, poorly constructed decks ultimately ruin the game.I have a deep love for Magic. It's one of the best card game's I've played, and I've been an avid player for years, playing both the online versions (MTG 2012-14, MTGO) and the real life version. So jumping into this, I thought I would love it out of pure fanboyism. And in fact, I did. The campaign in this game is good, although there's still some problems with AI cheating. The challenges were fun way to spend the time if I got tired of basic duels. Most importantly of all, Sealed play (a game mode where you construct your own decks) was the most enjoyable part of the game, a place where veterans like me could go and test their skill instead of facing people with the same decks. Every opponent was different, and that's where a player's skill lies.So what's the problem? The problem is that using my own created decks can only be so much fun. I said every deck was different in Sealed Play, but always within the same core group of cards. The variety was lacking, but this is it's first installment so I couldn't have gone it with too high hopes. So naturally, when I get tired of Sealed Play, I go to basic multiplayer with the dozen or so decks that the game provides me, right? Wrong. As the standard multiplayer is the main aspect of the game, it should have been the best, but ended up being the most terrible experience I've had in MTG.Each deck, without any cards unlocked, is pretty good in itself. If you used those decks in real life, you could play a pretty good game. In MTG 2014, as in the previous installments, the more games you win with a deck the more cards that are unlocked, usually good ones. To start off with, unlocking cards is painfully slow. 2013 had, let's say 30 unlockable cards, but each win would give you a card plus all of it's repeats, meaning you only had to win 15 or so times to unlock the full deck, so it didn't take too much of a grind. In 2014, each 30 cards has to be unlocked individually, leading to an incredibly slow grind that ultimately isn't feasible to do, especially since you have to win the game to unlock a card, could take upwards of 60 games to get the whole deck if you're good. When each game lasts around 10-20 minutes, that's just impossible, at least for me. The second problem is the card choices, each deck is riddled with the most overpowered game breaking cards imaginable, taking away all skill and making it a game of simply who can get out the most mythics (the technical term for game winning cards) in the least amount of time.Want to continue reading for a more in depth review?

Im glad you asked...I want a bunch of people to play and have fun and i want my games to get joined a lot more:P ..i know this is going to make a bunch of people happy too...i know when i figured it out my smile was from ear to ear. Also i have read so many peoples posts about being so unhappy about this specific limitation on pc for the sealed slots.you wont have all your campaign cards unlocked on the new accounts but im thinking some people may just be as happy about that too:) even if your not stoked on that you can always log back into your main steam account and play with all your unlocked decks and cards in other formats.This is my contribution to the community. For some reason i had kept coming back to that thought of ""if i could only reset or get more sealed slots""...now we all have it for free and can even clear up more slots every 90 days if we want.MarkDavidTheDJakaFaithNChrist & RPGALOT in gameGOD bless you guys! hope to see you in game!"

I've always had some interest in it, but the cost of getting the cards and having to learn how to actually play the game was always a deterrent.Then came along a Steam sale, and I bought this game having read that this is one of the best places to learn how to play the game for beginners. And I'm glad I did. At the moment I am over 20 hours into Magic 2014 and enjoying it inmensely. This while not even having tried online gaming, nor the expansion which I bought in the bundle, or a ""closed deck' game. As a matter of fact I don't even know what a ""closed deck"" game means, since I'm re-playing the campaign trying to unlock cards for the different sets. Again, this while being over 20 hours in the game.To concur with the other reviews: this is a fantastic place to learn how to play the game for beginners. The tutorial explains everything perfectly. As you go further into the campaign you will have cards with certain attributes which weren't explained in the tutorial, and with a simple mouse-click on the card you can see what it does. I'm surprised how easily it was to learn how to play Magic to be honest.Replayability is necessary to unlock most of the cards. Considering the enemies in the campaign play the same way every time, one might think this becomes boring. For me this couldn't be further from the truth. I am actually enjoying replaying the campaign with different sets. Since you play with different cards, you'll have to rethink your strategy and despite the AI playing the same order of cards every time (I don't think this is the case for bosses though) it still becomes a new experience with every set.As I said, I have never played Magic nor it's videogames, as such I can not judge this game by looking at other offerings and seeing what the 2014 version does worse (or better) than other versions. I can only tell that my experience with this game has been a very good one, and I would easily recommend it to anybody."

You can only use predefined decks and take out or in cards that are already part of that deck.Second: Sealed play is a joke...you get those 2 sealed deck slots but then you can't reset them if you change your mind or if you don't like your draft. Yes you can buy more slots but it doesn't solve anything.Third: Fix steam overlay, this has been a problem for a long time and there's still no fix for it! Yes in some computer it can be ""fixed"" by running the game as administrator, but it doesn't work on all PCs.Forth: quite often is very hard to know which cards you have unlocked because after winning in multiplayer most of the times the card unlocked doesn't get highlighted.For the people starting to play magic the tutorials are well done and will teach you well how to move and to understand game dynamics.Beside this I have to say it was nice to get the promo card at my Magic store and it is always nice to play with my friends both online and IRL."

You play the decks available in game with the option to add or subtract cards from a preset list for that deck. It's not a good game for learning about deck building.Why I recommend it: This is an excellent tool for learning the game mechanics. The pace is nice and slow, and the visuals make things very simple. The game won't allow you to make an illegal move, so as a new player it's an excellent way to learn what to do and when; it even goes as far as to show you which cards you CAN play at any given stage. It breaks down the steps and phases of a turn very clearly, so again, you can learn how the game works. Another, and probably one of my favorite features in the Digital MTG series is that whenever an ability is triggered, the game will slowly and visually show you exactly which cards are involved, with the option to enlarge the card and read the ability.It's a lot of small things that help learn to play the game that you probably wouldn't get with a human player, regardless of their patince. They just don't want to wait while you read every single card 2 or 3 times and trace with a finger everything that's going on.I recommend this game 100% for new players or people who are interested in starting out. It's cheaper than buying a pre-made deck in stores and comes with the advantage of masterfully teaching you how to play, without being so all encompassing as to eliminate your reason to play the 'real' game."

Otherwise you just get prefabs with loads of mythic rares and you can select/deselect cards)*Collecting, comparing, trading, etc.*Great moments of triumph from strategyWhat you DO get in this version:*creature battles*spells*lots of land tapping*online multiplayer with a couple different modes*Pay for features you should get with the game for free*Pay for booster packs*Pay for each extra deck slot*Pay some more and then some more, and then more after that*streamlined phases and actions*a pleasant casual experienceThey somehow took a lot of the fun out of the game, namely the collecting, trading, deck building, strategy, etc. But still have fun elements like creature battles, spells, art, etc. So this version could be called a streamlined version of Magic The Gathering's actual gameplay. It's sad that they didn't seem to care about adding the collecting and actual deck building, but I suppose they were either worried about competing with their physical cards' sales, or they just didn't think that the average Xbox 360 player (who this game is obviously targeted at, and designed for) have the patience or maybe even the capacity to collect, comprehend and create their own deck from scratch.I was rather disappointed to learn that the game lacked these crucial features (at least in a real experience), but found out through playing that although the most fun in the physical game is the winning with a deck that you built from scratch, the core mechanics of the card game still stands on its own. As for this computer game, it may not be a CCG, but it's a table top card game that is fun and casual but also a challenging experience.One final sour point: As mentioned above briefly, there is a whole lot to pay for to get basic features that should have been included with the game. I don't really have a problem with the paying aspect as that's what the physical MTG game is, if you think about it. But I do have a problem with the growing sentiment that game development should be one half-released product and the other half behind an extensive series of paywalls. There are 49 addons for this game, and although not all of them unlock features, this is quite the pathetic attempt to disguise large payments by splitting them up into dozens of ""DLC."" I guess it is up to each of us individual players and whether we want to stand for this blatant capitalization of gaming addiction and half-product half-""DLC."" I can't blame the industry for moving towards higher/hidden monetization of their titles, but I don't have to like it.P.S. About the Regenerate comment: activate Regenerate BEFORE combat damage and DURING the block phase AFTER they have assigned blockers. I know.. ""Regenerate before damage, WTF?!?!""  I don't know why, that's just the way this game works."

If you're a new player to M:tG, this is a great place to learn the very basic gameplay and mechanics of the game. You'll be exposed to cards from the very first sets all the way up to now. The game will have you unlock decks and stronger cards by facing other Planeswalkers. Deck construction is a bit limited, but with a pool of about80cards per deck, you should be able to come up with a few strategies for each of them. It's a great place to start if you don't want to pour money into the physical card game or Wizards of the Coast's Magic Online. Diehard fans may be a bit dissappointed with the game on the whole considering how broad and intense Magic can be outside of DoTP, but this game balances out the power curves you'll see in standard Magic: the Gathering play. You can add your own creativity in the Sealed Deck mode which enables you to build a 40-card deck from semi-radomized packs. You may have to switch your strategy as you play this mode, as you'll face different opponents who have different strategies. You won't get blown out by Pro decks, but watch out for the DLC decks as they are more powerful. You can join forces with your friends to face other AI Planeswalkers (which you can higher or lower in difficulty) or other human players.

Well, Magic 2014 is the collectible card game ""Magic The Gathering"" in its fourth iteration of the series ""Duels of the Planeswalkers"" (DotP), not to be confused with the Microprose game of the same name that also is known as ""Shandalar"".Magic 2014 allows you to compete with a number of pre-built decks (as of writing this: 10 in the base game, 5 in the expansion and 2 in the deck pack) with 60 to 100 cards against other pre-built decks or in the campaign mode against so-called ""encounters"" that don't follow the Magic deckbuilding rules.It would be too complicated to go into details of the complete Magic rules, but the basics should be explained here: When you build a deck, you can freely choose what cards you have in it, which include any number of basic lands, up to 4 of each other card of the same name, and up to 1 of each restricted card. In the computer game I review here, the game takes care already that you can't build an illegal deck unless you have less than 60 or more than 100 cards. The ""more than 100 cards"" rule does not apply in real-life magic but because of the influence of luck generally a deck is considered more efficient with less cards in it, unless it is specifically built to maintain a larger card base.After you have built your deck you can play. In the computer game, instead you have the pre-built decks with unlockable cards. This means you can customize your deck to a degree but not as freely as you would in real life Magic. This is on one hand good to introduce you to the game, on the other hand it also limits your options.When you start an actual game, usually both players (it works similarly in a game mode with more players) draw a hand of seven cards each. You can exchange that hand for another one with seven cards, then six etc. down to one. You will usually want to have a certain number of lands and other cards in your hand.Lands are used as a mana source. Almost every spell in the game costs mana. There are five mana colors in Magic plus colorless mana. A card that requires colorless mana to be cast can be paid with any mana, while a card that requires a specific color must be cast with that color. In the first turn, you will usually play a land - you can play at most one per turn unless other effects allow you to play more - and maybe cast a spell. There are different kinds of spells:Permanents are spells that go to the battlefield when cast. Those can be creatures, enchantments or artifacts. Creatures can attack the enemy, enchantments and artifacts have different effects that affect the gameplay. Usually a permanent can only be used by its controller, who normally is the one who cast the spell.There are also instants and sorceries which are spells that can be cast to have effects on the gameplay, for example making a creature stronger or weaker until the end of a turn, or dealing damage.In your main phases, you can play permanents and sorcerys, in your attack phases you can attack. If your opponent has the turn, he gets those benefits and you can block. Instants can be played at any time, even in the opponent's move. Two decks are even built partially around instants that prevent an enemy's spells from working.Your objective is to defeat your opponent who starts with the same amount of life as you, usually 20. When you win with a deck you unlock a new card that you can use in it later.Read the rest of the Review in the comments because of the artificial character limit by Steam!"

Unlike the actual card game though, your options to improve your garbage decks are severely limited.  It's a good way to learn to play Magic: The Gathering, but frustrating if you already know what you're doing and looking to build a decent deck.  Some of the later campaign matches are especially asinine as the AI opponent starts with a stacked deck that allows them to play all their best combos at the beginning of the match every single time in exactly the same order while you get stuck with a properly random shuffled deck.  The only way I was able to beat the last few campaign matches was by restarting over and over until I got a hand that I knew would stand a chance against the first few combos in the stacked AI deck.  That is not how Magic should be played.I only recommend this game to beginners interested in learning Magic: The Gathering, if you are already a Magic player you will probably find this game frustrating and annoying.  Half the fun of playing Magic is designing and building your deck, and that entire aspect of the game is poorly represented in this digital form.  Combine that with the fact that the AI basically cheats and the cards are literally stacked against you, and you have a video game that is only marginally as fun and entertaining as the actual card game it emulates."

The game mechanics, while mostly done well still have a few key elements that do not work properly (priority of effects triggered by cards entering the graveyard to point out one).  Also, for the campaign, Magic 2014 made all of the final fights at the end of each plane a fight against a fully scripted deck so there is no variation and you just have to build a deck knowing exactly what your opponent is going to play.  As a result, those games often became an issue of starting over until you got a decent beginning draw.  Very weak.Also to be clear this is just a rating of the single player content and the mechanics I have seen.  It may still be a solid multiplayer experience."

The visual style of the game is important for me so when I ran the game for the first time, I was pleased to see everything in the game as it is. The menu of the game is friendly, the color of the battleground is friendly to my eyes. The game itself is running smoothly while the newer ""brother"" from the series seems to have some ""slowness problems"" on the same machine...Even though I have never played previous versions of MtG so far, I still read many reviews and watched lots of game-plays which does not offer the same level of fun.CAMPAIGNThe campaign itself is pretty solid with all of those opponent's decks. Only the last fight against the main ""villain"" can be disappointing for someone. It is easy to face to someone (not only the ""villain"") who has some kind of disadvantage in the game. Actually there is a opponent's deck who is quite difficult versus some player's deck aiming on late game play-style.  If you want to use only one deck for whole campaign and own only basic version of the game, then you can ""feel the pain"" in some situations.SEALED PLAYEven I can confirm, that it does not offer anything special to players. It reminds me a draft, when it is difficult to collect a solid deck. And even if you buy new boosters, you can not use them all altogether. It is really weird. I played Sealed game-mode only for achievements.As for being a repetitive game-mode.Two-headed ogre is fine, but All-for-one is so much better according to my opinion. Four opponents attacking to each other offer unlimited variations.MY SUMMARYIf you like MtG as me, you will not regret to have the game in your library at all."
,Recommended,213850,17547152,"Posted: 15 August, 2015",all,Metal Bison [33rd],"In 1993, an American-based company namedWizards of the Coastacquired what is considered the world’s premier licensed trading card game, which was originally developed by a studious individual known as Richard Garfield. Now, with millions of individual cards in circulation and a highly distinguishable brand that bellows across the tabletop gaming world,Magic: the Gathering (MtG)has evolved into a highly successful franchise that includes in its catalogue an assortment of comic books, novels, and other merchandise.Magic 2014is a structured trading card game based on the physical card game of the same name, and is highly enjoyed by myself and  many others. Just like this variance of the game, it is quick and painless to learn, as everyone I have taught has picked up at least the basics during the course of one game.Here are some things that I enjoyed about this specific year’s instance of the video game series:Story - You take the role of a Planeswalker: a spellcaster that utilizes various forms of magic to defect countless enemies; this is also the premise of the player vs. player aspect inMagic: the Gathering. Throughout this story’s arch, you follow and ally yourself with Chandra Nalaar, a pyromancer seeking revenge against an enemy of great power. Chandra is one of the featured Planeswalkers within theMtGuniverse, her story told through multiple comic strips and novels since her original appearance in the 2000’s.Magic 2014sequences the player against multiple opponents in turn-based card game action as the story progresses through said battles and cutscenes that are, in my opinion, pretty awesome.Draft Mode - Similar to real-life booster drafts for the trading card game,Magic 2014is the first of theDuels of the Planeswalkersseries to feature Draft Mode, in which a player receives a given number of booster packs in order to create an in-gameMagic: the Gatheringdeck, which is then utilized to defeat multiple enemies in succession. Though only two different decks are allowed through this game mode without having to dish out some extra spending cash for downloadable content (DLC), the player can earn additional booster packs that expand the total pool of cards they can use to modify their deck; this further enhances customization and overall play. There are also hints displayed on screen during deck construction that aide newer players when first creating and later editing a ‘library.’Connectability to the Card Game - Though it has very clunk player interfaces and you cannot tap your own mana,Magic 2014is exactly what you’d expect it to be: a video game adaptation of theMtGtrading card game. The similarities boil down to game mechanics, the utilization of cards that were in circulation, noteworthy Planeswalkers and other characters from the base game and novels, and even the ability to purchase foil deck conversions at an additional price as a cosmetic change.Magic 2014is, simply, the sameMagic: the Gatheringtrading card game that millions have enjoyed for years converted to a digital format.TL:DR -Magic 2014is a great entrant into theDuels of the Planeswalkersseries that can either be utilized as a teaching tool for card game players interested in learning theMtGtrading card game or as a standalone title with varying styles of play and degrees of challenge. I would like to give a very special thanks to ‘the guys’ for enjoying the physical variance of this card game with me for many years. Also, a big thank you to my fantastic fiancé for being addicted to purchasing booster packs for me so that I could own more cards in an unbearable stack than I ever thought I could.

It has improved on previous versions, but it is particularly annoying to know that a card works one way and DotP seems unaware of this fact.New players won't notice this, and the 2014 version certain makes the UI a little more responsive, making it less likely for you to miss an opportune trigger.Deck building is a generous description of what really happens. each deck is, in essense a 90 card deck, and you unlock a good number of those cards throughout the playing of the game - or you can pay to unlock them. The final deck is no powerhouse, but when compared to the relatively terrible decks you are started with, it's a rewarding experience to take those powered up decks against previous opponents against whom you may have struggled and crush them mercilessly.The sealed deck element is both brilliant and remarkably dumb at the same time. You can do sealed 2 times before you must buy more slots. This little money grab makes the experience highly frustrating. You can not delete the boring, or bad, pool of cards you once had. It was the most fun I had in the game, and the one reason I never went back after finishing them. If I wanted to pay money to draft, I would actually go draft online or in person and walk away with cards I can use for other things.Nothing is overly challenging in this game, and with any level of decent magic skill, you will outplay your opponents easily. they are predictable, easily trapped and setting up blowouts can make even the unfair matches seem relatively easy.Overall, however, the casual magic player will enjoy this game, and deal with the limitations and weaknesses.

,Not Recommended,213850,10067553,"Posted: 9 May, 2014",all,DamianTheAlien,"I enjoy MTG CCG. This however really annoys me. It also loads slowly.Extremely frustrating and very poorly balanced. Your first campaign starts you with two single coloured pre-built decks with no option to optimize each deck save to remove cards. Now this is fine until you reach the fourth duel in the challenge where you face an extremely optimized white fast creature deck and you are defeated time and time again. To progress I imagine you have to go back and duel the previous fights to get the right cards to begin tweaking your decks. Those who remember the ""duals of the planeswalkers"" computer game will befrustrated by an annoyingly steep difficulty curve without immediate access to tweaking your deck.Learning is slow paced for key concepts but for more complicated powers that involve interrupting play (e.g. regeneration) these are not explained.  Those who are prepared to grind the first couple of campaign scenarios (or spend money to unlock decks of course) might be a lot more satisfied. Play the demo and if you are a wiz at the game, consider buying if cheap. Otherwise you might get ninety minutes of enjoyment and four hours of frustration."

There is a way to play in multi-player against other Steam players but that is not the focus on this game. Ultimately the game is designed to get the player introduced to Magic the Gathering and then transition them to the CCG in the real world (non-digital).If you want to learn the game or are a fellow store owner who wants to introduce the game to new players, download this game.

If you expect to play against AI characters in two headed dragon, then you are better off just turning the game off and saving yourself the frustration. They have better decks and always seem to draw the perfect card to screw you over at just the right time. Also viewing the cards can be troublesome sometimes when the game decides that you had enough time and now you should stop.The game can be fun for usually simple campaign duels and playing against other players is easy and fun, which could easily make this game a good entry point to Magic: The Gathering over having to buy a bunch of cards. But the game is definitely best enjoyed with friends.At the end of the day this game is just the at the time Magic:The Gathering game. Pretty soon a new one will be released if it has not already. But this one seems like a step back from 2013, so hopefully the 2015 version will be better than this."

It managed to get me and several other people ordering magic decks to play together in person, then get them to buy it on steam to play when we were apart! However, i would not spend the extra money for the foils, as it does almost nothing, they get a slight shine, and the legendary creatures get a short, 4 second animation. Just get the $10 one or wait for a sale on the special edition. Id reccomend getting the regular game, then spending half the $10 you saved on the expansion to unlock 5 more decks (50% mroe cards, and theyre badass). Also, look up the promo codes online beforeyou play so you get a slight boost with all of your decks when you first start leveling them!!

In fact, it might be more friendly to beginners than it is to long-time players, who might have some challenge adapting to some of the mechanic changes. The campaign isn't the longest, clocking in at under a dozen hours, and whilst the ""tables"" or backgrounds for matches have little to no diversity, the presentation as a whole is solid.Still, given the low price, it's good value for money. Of course, if you want to spend a lot of time making your own decks in sealed play, you'll probably want to shell out extra money to unlock the slots.

Let's go to some specific points nowDeck Variety: Pretty varied decks, we don't have only the monocolored decks we know we have double-colored and triple-colored as well. There are even TWO white decks. All of them have a different style of play, fitting most of the players playing style.Cards Variety: I expected a little bit more, but I'm by no means disappointed. We've got some quite interesting cards.Graphics: C'mon, it's not the most important thing in this game. The graphs are more than enough for it.DLC: It's cheap and it's worth it. You can use the 3 or 4 decks (don't remember) you gain to play in the SP as well as the MP. They're unique in this game. All of them are varied and we even have a really good elves deck in this DLC that uses some really old physical cards. Pretty good.Also, both the game and its DLC are cheaper right now. I'd buy the Special Edition if I were you, really worth it.Magic 2014 - Duels of the Planeswalkers is undoubtedly the best TCG we've in Steam. We've got a great variety of both decks and cards.

The Prebuilt decks offer a lot of nice synergy cards which many beginners might not be able to understand. And you can grasp the basics from this. I actually wish other friends of mine played this before starting to play real magic. I facepalmed when I learned they didn't know that a counter spell could counter everything unlike a counter creature/aura/enchantment/sorcery instant.- Fun to play with friends. Always has been. And it has Two-Headed Giant. I wish it had Planechase as well but we can't have it all.Some customizable cards. You can choose the amount of lands and select from the predefined cards. Plus the codes for 10 free cards are available. Just search it up on Google.- Nice interface. Compared to the next installment. I definitely like this interface better.Cons:- To get the full experience from the base game you'll want to buy the Magic 2014 - Gold Game pack. Otherwise you can look up a method of adding custom decks. That makes it much more bearable.- Grinding. Yes you need to win games to get cards. It's a hassle but worth it if you play your favorite deck. I still hate grinding though.- Sealed Play. We all had different perceptions of it back when this game first came out. And yes it was disappointing. Never buy sealed decks. Honestly mod the game and play singleplayer with decks that you made for free.With that said, I will recommend this game because it's still good.

I don't regret buying the game only because I knew what I was getting.And that's not the complete MTG 2014 experience.If freedom of deck building is what you're looking for, don't bother with this game - even the sealed play is heavily restricted.That feeling of having an almost great deck is horrible when you know it could be better if you could just pool all your cards together and nab from there.The game is somewhat good for beginners as it does give you plenty of time to familiarise yourself with the mechanics while keeping track of the game for your (which I still struggle with sometimes with all my experience), but as it takes away parts of the game I truely enjoy, I'm cautious to recommend it to those who haven't experienced the physical game itself."

It tells you what you can do in each phase (and explains what phases are), how cards are played and when you can play certain cards.You can look at the cards, read-up on effects and special abilities (IRL the abilities are usually explained on the cards, less so in game, but there's a ""more info"" button, which is helpful), which is super helpful sometimes.Also, I thank myself for getting this during the sale at an insanely low price, it's fun to play with friends - in fact, it can be a blast to play this with friends; you can have a 4-man party, 2v2, or one-for-all, which is really nice.So, why the negative review?Because this game is more money-grabbing than most other games I've seen. You buy the original game, yet you soon realise that it's either a horrible grind to fully unlock a deck and even more of a horrifying grind to fully unlock all preset decks, or you have to spend 1 euro to buy a ""deck key""; it's not even 1 or 2 euros for all decks, but for each deck!The campaign, depending on your starter deck, is at times impossible, because the AI has the same scripted hand every time you play against them. You might have to replay the same guy 4 or 5 times before being able to beat them (happened to me on the blasted tutorial boss for christ's sake!), which is (to me) boring and frustrating.The challenges are quite fun, but can also get extremely annoying and are, at times, nearly impossible to figure out too.The sealed challenge part is just an insane money grabbing ploy. You get 5 boosters to make a deck and that's it, final. They don't allow you to reroll your deck; the excuse is so that people don't constantly reroll to get the best deck and just own online, to the point of becoming #1 in the leaderboard, but guess what! You can buy slots for more decks, essentially making it possible for people with money to waste to just buy 20 slots and still get that perfect, beat-all, deck.PAY TO WIN in a nutshell here!Another problem is that the campaign can be finished in a few hours if you're lucky - so you get the expansion DLC, which unlocks a few more decks, but again, it doesn't fully unlock them, you have to grind for that, or spend even more money!Then they sell deck expansions, more money, grind to unlock or pay to unlock, more money!TL;DR: Can be fun if you have friends with which to play, but otherwise it's a money-grabbing ploy that's simply a reboot of previous years' games."

This results in exiting matches with almost no overpowered deck combinations. So in the end the best player wins and not the deck. Also the gameplay and graphics are the best of any magic game. Controls are very simple and you can do anything as in reallife magic.All cards can be unlocked by winning matches or if you are lazy you can purchase deck keys.

Except it's another rip off, if you get lucky you might get an OP deck, good for you! looks fun at first then you notice you'll struggle hard to find any player to compete with you.. and then once you unlocked those 2 ""free"" sealed deck bad surprise! if you want more deck or if your draws were terrible and both sealed deck you have you CAN'T reset them and you have to PAY to get more slots! and not just a few cents, no, 2 euros just for ONE sealed deck that might turn out terribad again, pure waste!Actually until not long ago from the 6th sealed deck and up DLC you'd have to pay about 9 euros just to unlock 3 sealed deck slots packages! what a RIP OFF!so talking about price check it out, about 60+euros to have a full 2014 version, which gets you basically 3 or 4 decks worth playing but you'll get very bored of them fast, probably won't have any players to compete with within a few months with the 2015 version coming up and a game FULL of BUGS!Yes another huge bad thing about the 2014: it doesn't resolve ANYTHING from the 2012 and 2013 (well actually a recent patch in the 2012 broke a deck you can't keep it unlocked anymore, it hasn't happened YET in the 13 and 14..), you'll end up with a limit to token on the board as usual, freezes, game sync issues which won't get solved until one of the players leave the game and to make matter worse when you're trying to unlock decks if your opponent leaves the game for rage quit or whatever reason you HAVE to fight the AI until it's over unlike the 2012 and 2013 where you could choose weither or not you wanted the AI to take over, making the unlocking process a pain in the *SS, basically trying to force your hand to pay 1e per deck key to unlock them!So if you like magic what I recommend you best is to either go get some cards in real life and play there (that won't cost you much more than the sealed deck DLC anyway!!!) or buy the 2013 version which has much better decks and variety and pretty much as many online players anyway) or even get the 2012 if you get it on steam sales, you might struggle to get some multiplayer going but the decks are way more fun anyway (might wanna wait until the Treefolk deck isn't freaking bugged anymore though, how can you realease a patch 3 years after the launch of the game and BREAK the game is beyond me, just proves how bad the dev are and how much they do not care about their customers nor their games!)So there you have it, DON'T give your money to vampires by buying the 2014, especially for the full price, at least wait until some solid 60+% sales or you might regret it, I DO"

And let me just say, when I'm playing a video game, I shouldn't be confronted with the decision to spend more money or stop playing within the first 2 hours of play. The base game might as well be free since Wizards will nickle and dime you for all you're worth. Enjoy sealed format? 2 bucks a pop after the first 2. Enjoy new decks? 3 bucks a pop. Want foil cards? Seriously? Why? Well, that's money too.This game is the pinnacle of money grubbing developers, which is a shame because I don't mind spending money on a quality game I enjoy (up to a point), but just the feeling of 'pay me or you can't play,' makes me say 'Thanks, but I guess I won't play or buy from you again.'Pros: it's magic, it's generally funCons: obvious money grubbing, limited playability, you're better off going to shops and playing magic or just playing something else at allOverall, would not buy if you've played a decent amount of Magic before; BUT if you're looking to learn, you can pick this up pretty cheap and get a feel for your playstyle.

Why would a company digitize that game and charge $15 - $50.The offline game is a linear set of decks, and nothing else.Most content is pay and see, meaning; after buying the game you must also buy content created at the same time as the game. It's not new content. It's pay for content.This game could be like the 1990's ""MAGIC THE GATHERING"" PC card game.  You could have craft your own deck, or explored a gui rpg world like fallout or an elderscrolls game.  Where fights could be settled with cards.A magic the gathering online game could include the ability to play as other editions of the original game, or have a special mixed aditions play.  In fact with todays technology a single engine could support multaple card games like pokemon, battle-tech, or the infamous my little pony.  Think of TF2 and how it evolves over time, or the halflife engine which has multiple games born from it.  you could have a main engine that lets you purchase the rights to different versions of magic as they come out, you could purchase an ""orange box"" that may contain ;fallen empires, arabian nights, 16th edition, Erza trilogy, Portal, Portal2 etc.But you don't.  In fact you don't get much of anything in this game.  And considering how good computer games of the same price are. There is no excuse why these yearly released magic games suck so much, except for one; greed.I recomend you don't buy this, or any other magic card game for the pc. Especialy those yet to come out.

The more I played it the more limited I realized it is. I LOVE the fact it covers so many different sets, I HATE the fact you dont get to build a personal deck. It's not even a DLC option which astounds me. I would consider this more a tool for teaching how Magic is played rather than a game. You go through the game one battle at a time to unlock preconstructed decks with up to a total of 100 cards available. There are many decks to unlock, but none of them can be mixed. Theres a booster campaign but those cards are locked to that specific campaign and you're limited to how much you can grow your collection.TLDR; Great learning tool, but if you're looking for a virtual MtG that you can just build a collection and play with friends, this is definitely not it.How I think it could be fixed:If they do start listening to customer feedback, this could easily be fixed by simply making a custom deck slot DLC and even selling booster packs (at a lower cost than paper cards of course, I mean, it's virtual after all.) They still generate money, and I get to have a nice neat virtual collection that I can play against friends with. Theres just something about winning against another person with something you created completely from scratch rather than a limited set of 100 cards. Completely different feelings."

Every enemy you meet has it's own tactic how to play against you so you have to find out a way how to defeat him. I stucked at one enemy for example for 6 games until I was able to outmaneuver his tactic. And if you really like challenges you can choose higher difficulty which makes your way through game really uncomfortable. Difficulties are Mage, Archmage and Planeswalker.There is also a Multiplayer where you can face up to 3 other players at once in modes like free-for-all or Two-headed giant.It's a really good game with beautiful graphics and many options and I would really recommend it.

If you are a MTG lover, this is a good place to be. The deck variety is very good, even with the base game alone, but the DLC expands on this greatly.The different difficulty settings offer a choice for either new or old players, though even the lowest setting still provides a challenge. The highest setting, however, can be rediculous at times. Sometimes it feels like the AI is cheating to get whatever card is teh best at that moment. They will play a land card every single turn, and they always have just the right creature or spell to counter you. This can be very frustrating, and it is even worse in a 2v2 match against two AI's. The AI in Magic 2013 felt more...  organic, than it does here.Sealed play is a uniqie mode that adds the real life excitement of opening a new pack of cards to the ever present grind. I have not played it as much as I have other modes, but I still enjoy it.Overall, I strongly recommend this game to anyone who likes either Magic, Card games in general, or anyone who likes to test their brain.

The bad thing about this Sealed campaign is you get two slots to make different decks, if you want any more, well you need money for that. You can't delete old saves for the sealed campaign.

This is ridiculous.And then I realize that you need to pay for new deck or card or whatsoever. Alright, I get it, so you want us to pay more for better cards.

As an owner of the first 2009 version I can quickly say that it has been several improvements over the years. You have more freedom with the decks, as you are able to swap all cards  from the preset decks out, and put your new and better unlocked cards in. The gameplay is still Magic 2014. Nothing to hold against them here, as they stay true to the source cardgame.The decks are varied, and challenges you to try different gameplaying styles. Some are aggro, others are control, and some rely on specific strats. Each deck has 40 unlockable cards. Some of them are throwaway horsegarbage while other strengthens your deck signicantly. With the amount of unlockable cards you can see varians between how people choose to play each deck.The multiplayer is lacking in content. Which is really Magic 2014 biggest weakness. With such a fanbase as MTG has, it should've been Stainless Games first priority to make the player vs player experience immense and filling.Instead you get a bareboned version. Where you go into ""lobbies"" with your opponent(s). Chose your deck and go. That's it. No ladders, no tournaments and barely no reason to play multiplayer other than playing against other human players.Also the addition of sealed play feels like nothing but a tease. Here they could've done so much more. Maybe even made it into an arena (Hearthstone) type of experience.Summary+ Fun and varied decks+ New Deck packs are being constantly developed added(tho at a price of 3euro per 2 decks)+ Good AI, the best in the series so far+ Lots of gametime if you want to try and unlock everything+ Challenges and singleplayer campaign of decent length- Multiplayer is bare boned- Sealed play is bare boned- Some unlockable cards are utterly useless- Somewhat clumsy menu and UI.I would definitively recommend this to fans of cardgames and especially Magic: The Gathering. If you hate card games and/or lack patience, stay away.It will not be like Magic online, which is much more advanced and challenging to both new and more seasoned players. So if you are a die hard Magic nerd,  you would probably be better off with Magic Online. That said, this is a good entrylevel for completly new player."

In the campaign mode, the four or five animation movies are quite poor, show nothing interesting and graphics are bad. As you can see in the fith screenshot planes are a short trip, 3 encounters against weird buids with fixed gameplay that will force you to use different decks in order to beat them, and a last one, a boss using a unlockable deck. You get a short text with every one of this four encounters, plus an introductory one for the plane, and that's it. Once this are beaten you can face a Planeswalker (of five) and unlock its deck or move to the next plane. There are 5 planes like this in the core game, and the last boss (you fight it alongside Chandra). Beating him unlocks revenge mode, where you get a rematch against the ten playable decks and a final one agains the last boss.In sealed deck mode, first and second screenshots, you get six sealed booster packs, and with the random cards they contain you build a deck, wich you can use to face up to six computer controlled decks, a test-deck that spams 1/1 fliers, plus other players also using their sealed decks. You can recieve another three booster packs in the singleplay mode. Now, there are two slots avalaible in sealed mode, and every sealed deck use one of this, for good, it cannot be restarded. Extra slots can be purchased, up to a maximum of 20 (3rd, 4th and 5th slots cost 1'99 each, 6-10, 11-15, 16-20 slots are sold in groups of four for 8'99 each). Quite messy.10 challenges, and multiplayer (1vs1, 1vs1vs1vs1, 2vs2)The expansion adds two planes in campaign mode, 5 unlockable decks (meaning 5 encounters in revenge) and 5 challenges.There are playable decks as dlc, for 2'99 you get a couple of those.Soundtrack is very good, and so is the artwork. Gameplay is fine, unless you want to use a gamepad.As I said, the game could be better, has a lot of potencial, but it's still used as an introduction to the actual card game. That doesn't mean is not a good game, and even if some of the dlc are way overpriced  (would you buy everything the total spent would be close to 100 €), the core game and the expansion have a huge value for the money.Core game: 4/5DLC: 2/5"

The PC version will only let you do something 'by the book', whereas if you don't fully understand the rules when playing in person you can end up doing something wrong.After playing both this game and the 2013 version, I'd say that 2014 is a much stronger choice.

Magic 2014 is by far a huge update from past games.  The co-op modes have been included and improved, and we finally see the beginnings of a serviceable sealed play format (think Hearthstone Arena or Scrolls Judgement modes).The UI in this installment is slick and responsive.  I love that this game streams well, too, so I will be doing more YouTube and Twitch gameplay videos for sure.  There are tons of features packed into this game.  I'd say this is the definitive version of Magic online.  Campaign/single-player is satisfying as well.  I will say I found even the initial battles challenging so this is a great tool for shaking off rust or [re]learning the MTG ropes..  It's a fantastic introduction to the ""Return to Ravnica"" series, too.  Excellent across the board.At it's core, this is still fundamentally the same game.  At $10 or less, it's worth it.  You can grind to unlock all the pre-made decks, which you can tweak a bit to your liking, or you can pay to unlock the decks.  Some complain about the microtransactions due to the silly business of buying foil conversions and deck slots but these items are more for the hardcore players..  or those who are impatient.My only complaint, if I had to say something bad, would be that the DotP: SE version is pretty poop.  They should have included more deck slots for sealed play and perhaps a token to unlock your preferred deck.  The eBook and soundtrack are cool additions but that could have been a third tier bundle, really.I think this will be my last DotP purchase as it seems that Wizards is committed to releasing one of these every year, which sucks because it spreads the online community thin.  They seem to use this series as a glorified marketing piece but, fortunately, the replay value is very high in spite of these blatant greedy moves.

The rest is good.Rating (5/10 = failure): 6.5Multiplayer: YesCompletion: 14Cards: NoCloud: YesCost: 5 USDIf you played the other Magics, you know the drill. This isn't much different; just some rebalanced decks based on previous theme decks. That said, who in the world did the testing for this game?The first few battles are pretty standard. You get to pick between a monogreen or monored deck (both of which are kind of on the weak side). Battles are a little harder than normal, but perfectly doable. And then suddenly you are pitted against a monowhite weenie deck. Those are brutal in just about all Magic editions! It's not even a special deck; it's just some random unnamed mook. Green just isn't fast enough, and red will exhaust its instants with no good permanents on the field.Once you beat that, you get to face... another white weenie deck. Brilliant. Following that, you get an entire plane that is easy, a few moderate battles here and there, and finally some decent challenges. Suffice it to say, the difficulty is out of whack. And I've been through the entire game with each and every (non-DLC) deck. The pattern remains the same.The campaign itself is pretty short- around 30 battles (provided you attack the other optional planeswalkers too). I would have liked about 2x more main campaign battles set at a proper difficulty curve. That would have gone a long way in enhancing the experience.Puzzle mode still exists, but it's not part of the campaign this time around. Most of them are pretty easy too with the exception of the last one. Not much else to say about that mode.By now you can already tell there's going to be a Magic 2015, 2016, etc. etc. So I guess the only question is what's new? Sealed deck mode! Sealed deck is the most promising feature of Magic 2014... and yet it's also the least developed.Sealed deck plays much like it sounds. You get a handful of random cards and make a deck any way you can out of them, and pit it against another sealed deck. It's great. But there's only like, 5 battles and a few boosters, and then you're done. Wut?How easy and fun it would have been if we were allowed to make new sealed decks over and over, and in longer campaigns? But no. Sealed decks use your username as a seed, so you'll end up with the same cards every time, and to play with more sealed decks, you must purchase DLC slots for them. Yes, you must buy slots for more sealed play which is like a 1-hour game at best.I understand games are a business, but this is just an insulting cash grab. I understand using seeds for multiplayer games to ensure someone isn't cheating using cards they couldn't possibly get using their name. But what I'm asking for is unlimited single player sealed play. Where's the harm in that? Oh, I'm sorry, replayability is for suckers. We can't have that undermining our real card game, now, can we? Players should be grateful we even included some form of sealed play. /eye rollAnyway, I won't include sealed play in the final rating because it's optional and grabby. The base game is fine, and fun (with a horrible difficulty curve), but without a proper sealed deck mode, there's very little this game offers compared to previous installments."

While I wasn't too big into Magic before playing this game; the game did however make it easier for me to understand Magic much better than I did before. However, the actual game itself suffers from a short campaign and a shorter sealed campaign; as well as a low number of opponents to play against in custom play.First the good stuff, while the campaign is too short for a seasoned magic player; a beginner should find the campaign as a 4 hour tutorial on the basics of the game. The sealed campaign is also a good way for beginners to apply what they've learned to create a deck with a strategy all their own.But unfortunately the main game only uses cards from the 2014 Core set and there is a limit in the sealed campaign that keeps you from creating more decks. You could buy those slots, but it's more beneficial to just get into the actual trading card game.The experience is enjoyable, but too pricey. I recommend picking this game up if you’re a beginner or a seasoned player with very few people to play with. I also recommend picking this game up when it’s on sale."

You are given decks that you can edit and devise a strategy with the cards given in that deck (keeping in mind that you can only use 60-100 cards and 40% of them have to be land cards. Every card in Magic has a mana cost (except lands) to pay for these mana costs Magic uses 5 different elements known as land cards that produce mana: *Fire ~ Mountain *Darkness ~ Swamp *Earth ~ Forest *Water ~ Island *Light ~ plains, Each element has its own things that they are good at and bad at and part from your life force bar these lands are your main resource. In away lands are a bit like money you spend them witch leads to investing in more money and when it your turn again you get paid again, of course the more money you have the bigger and better things you can buy and so on. To win the game you must think carefully and play your cards right to either take your opponent's life force to 0 or make them run out of cards and its very rear that anyone comes to a draw. Matches can last anything from 5 mins to an hour and a half but a good average match lasts about half an hour.My opinion & More InfoI wouldn't say this game is totally mind-blowing but it is in all fairness its a grate game! Out of the 150+ games i have on my list its the most played and iv met some good people and made some friends from all over the world with magic 2014, but i don't just recommend 2014, all of the Magics are great and i recommend them to all, even if your not a fan of card games, i know people that hate card games however, they love this one. For me 2014 just feels nicer and more user friendly, it only takes 1 or 2 matches to pick up most of the rules, plus i like the new game mode""Sealed Play"".As for the campaigns they are all fun, not very long but that has been balanced out in difficulty and the amount of of them, some of the matches you will find easy some you will learn to hate, it depends on how you build your decks. progressing threw these campaigns unlocks decks, but you still have to win about 30 times with each deck before you have all the cards in them decks (unless you buy them instead!). No doubt that you will find online mutiplayer easier than playing against the AI as the AI has a very big and bad habit of cheating and i find 2014 cheats more than the previous Magics but hey that makes the win even more rewarding right!! Plus if an AI in a card game wasn't able to cheat then it would be too easy and boring and would make the game rather lousy.Game ModesFree For All- This mode is hole idea of Magic and is the most played it can be played by 2 players or anything up to 4 players there really isn't much to tell about this mode other that what iv already told you. like all the other game modes its just some good relaxing fun and if you can get your opponents talking you get a good giggle out of it, even more so when you are really good friends with that person.Two Headed Giant- This game mode requires a little bit of team work and 4 players. The game mode works the same way as Free For All but with a twist, you are split into teams of 2. you and your partner share the same life force and do your best to defend it, you are able to see yours and your partners hand so then if they a card that can help you or the other way round you can just tell them (unless your partner is an AI of course) but the only the abilities or effects you own only work for you and you also have your own supply of land cards the rest of the game is just like Free For All. This game mode can come up with some interesting results as some decks just don't mix and others compliment each other rather well.Sealed Play- This mode is like a sub game mode its completely different form the other two main modes (Free For Alland [/b]Two Headed Giant[/b] use the decks you buy or slowly unlock). Sealed Play is made to make things more like the paper version of Magic. You get given 5 booster packs of random cards and then your expected to make a deck of at least 40 cards (there is an auto build option) and then you can fight your way threw that deck's campaign to earn more cards but you can also use it in online multiplayer, sadly at the moment there is no way of trading cards with friends or resetting decks also you can only go head to head with this game mode, I'm looking forward to this changing because Sealed Play has a lot of potential and i don't think it has met any where near its potential (lazy Dev's or maybe there just gathering ideas for the future of this game mode).Thanks for reading all this, its a lot i know but i hoped it helped and you at least give it a try as its not that price heavy and you can get a really good time out of it, like i have. One last thing if there is cards you cant seam to unlock that is because there is something called promo cards that you have to unlock using codes."

You can only play the sealed mode twice before you have to pay for more deck slots to start a new game.  You can't delete your saves once you complete a sealed deck campaign and even if you're clever about it and delete the save from the game folder, the cards that come the sealed pools are saved to your Steam account, so you'll end up with the same cards.It gets worse.  Let's say you really love the sealed mode, which I did in my two campaigns, and you really want to play more of it.  You want to play more of it so badly that you pay for more deck slots.  That's great, to each their own.  BUT.  They limit how many deck slots you can have even after purchasing.  So, even if you decide to pay to play more of a game that you already own, they won't even let you pay -more- to keep playing.  At a certain point, you're completely done with Sealed.  You just can't play anymore.  They added a format to make money, but don't want to take your money.  Fun.Overall, the gameplay is great and what Sealed you do get to play was super fun, but the fact that a replayable game can end is just a buzzkill."

Perfect for newcomers to the card game. However, for the experienced Magic player, or even someone who prefers deck building in general, this game can be somewhat frustrating. You do not have the ability to create custom decks. Only decks you can create AND create are sealed decks, and all the cards in the game are from M14 and M14 boosters. You can't create decks from scratch and only crack M14 boosters. Most of the cards are the same anyways. The game's Intellegence in-game (NOT the AI Opponent) is sometimes lacking in ability resolving, since it's intellegence doesn't stem into human reasoning when playing the physical game. Sometimes it does weird things that isn't intended.Overall, it's a good game to play Magic when you don't have your cards or you're not in the proper enviroment, however, if you want the full experience and the real deal, buy Magic cards or play Magic: Online (95% exact replica of the physical card game but in online format).6.9/10"

But the worst thing you can say about this game is that it does not allow for the scope of freedom that is inherant in Magic: The Gathering.The positives, as in any good game worth your money, far outweigh the negatives. First of all there are many pre-arranged packs of cards which you can use in both the single player campaign and online with other players, and winning games unlocks more cards for each pack. You can play 1v1, or 'Two Headed Giant' mode for 2v2, or Free For All for as many as 4v4. The campaign is straightforward and entertaining (even if I still think 'Clones of Simic' encounter is lame) and teaches even novice Magic players the rudiments of the game.Sealed Mode, which is obviously the most controversial part of this game, is misunderstood. Many players complain about not being able to trade for cards, or 'reset' their decks to get a mulligan. Guess what? That's the point of Sealed Mode, you have to make the best with what you're given. This teaches deck optimization and conservative thinking, and you can play online knowing every other player did the same, they didn't just pull a trade to arrange some pre-conceived card combo they looked up online from players better than themselves to give themselves an unfair advantage.Magic 2014 is not only worth your time, but your money.

Because for a sub-casual Magic player like me, it's good enough, and $10 is peanuts compared to the cost of playing Magic in a live setting.  I'll get at minimum 10 hours out of this, and probably more due to multiplayer with friends.  If you're new to Magic, this is a nice learning tool, and the limitations inherent in DotP are actually a good thing for a novice player with no deckbuilding experience.  And really, those people are the target audience for this product; If you're a seasoned Magic veteran, you know there are alternatives that give you greater freedom with deckbuilding.So, with that out of the way, different things about DotP 2014 (as compared to previous DotP titles): there's more lore-related stuff throughout the campaign, though the story may as well be non-existent, which I consider neither a virtue nor a flaw for a title like this.  (You don't play Magic for the story.)  The client seems more stable and less sucky than the one for DotP 2013.  There's no way to skip encounters during the campaign, which is a bit annoying for someone who isn't really interested in ""puzzle"" games and just wants some vanilla Magic against an AI opponent.The alternate game mode in DotP (replacing Planechase in DotP 2013 and Archenemy in DotP 2012) is sealed play, where you get access to two random card pools out of the gate--if you want to have additional sealed pools after that, you'll need to buy them for $2 apiece.  Some people loathe this, but as someone who has spent $25 a pop for sealed play in a live setting, I personally don't mind too much, and as extras go, I find it sealed play to be more substantive and enjoyable than Planechase in DotP 2013.  I've paid more than that for new deck DLC in previous versions of DotP which have offered substantially less replayability and enjoyment.Magic is a good game, and one that you'll probably enjoy if you like turn-based tactics games.  DotP is just one way to experience Magic, and if you've never played Magic, it's probably the best way."

You can play a number of pre-made decks against computer or human opponents, which unlocks more cards that use can use to tweak the decks.The big improvements to this version are the music, which is pretty good now, and the story, which reveals something about the greater MtG storyline for a change. The graphics are nice as always, and the control is decent as always. The new decks are fun to play with, but most of them are very similar to decks in Duels 2013. New encounters make the single player campaign more interesting. Sadly, the challenges are much easier this time.A new addition this year is Sealed Deck mode. There's a huge caveat that they don't tell you, and it was almost a dealbreaker for me: you can only play Sealed twice. I mean, you can use your deck from Sealed as much as you want, but you only get two pools to make decks from. The rest will cost you $2 a piece. Unfortunately, I was done with Sealed very quickly, and it didn't add much to the game for me. At least it's better than Magic Online?If you're going to buy a Magic: the Gathering game, Magic 2014 is the bet one so far, and it still had tons of content for the $10 price.

If you mistakingly try to pause and do it one second to early or too late, you will miss your window and the action won't work. In fact, just today I tried to counter a very powerful creature and it didn't work...""No valid targets"" it said. Then the creature was out and it was too late and I got smashed into the ground. If that counter worked who knows.In addition, the timing system where it forces phases and rounds to glide by is entirely too fast. If you have 10 creatures and need to choose defenders for a spore rush that will kill you without careful planning and you only have 30 seconds....you will lose.Oh, and do you want to read that 200 word card description to make sure it does exactly what you think? English better be your native tongue and you better read fast fast fast because if not you'll easily waste over half your turn, which leaves little to no time to actuall DO your turn.This game removes any strategy aspect of Magic and distills it down to complete luck, as any real strategy is lost when every 10th action you take is swallowed up without results by a clunky interface and unforgiving timer system.I expected something better from a multimillion dollar company, but cutting corners is all I got."

This is a ""strategy game"" first and foremost so if you, as a beginner, don't have access to combining the color types, or even playing a solid color type you wont get far, nor does it teach you Magic because deck creation/play style is 80% of this damn game and there is none; so you cant try the strats that are more suited to your personality/play style ...you just cant. Sorry. There is no custom deck creation in this game and you are forced to use the very lame/un- thoughtout decks they provide. The interface is clean and simple to use however it takes way to long to go from turn to turn even if you go to options and turn off all the animations, pop ups, and tips turns still take way to long. Why do i have so many hours logged if i hate the game? Because i modded the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of it with custom mods, thats why, and no the game does not support mods.Ai: First I want to say this game has incredibly sloppy and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Ai. I would even go as far as to say Rigged. As you go through the game unlocking cards to improve your deck you will quickly notice that the Ai is locked in its decision making do to the fact it is based on a deck strategy, the Ai will not alter or improvise in anyway. Hell ive even been in instances where the Ai has no idea as to what to do to counter what i had just done so it does nothing and just continues to lay down land cards even though he has cards to take action. Putting the game on max difficulty changes very little im terms of difficulty and is still far to easy. The AI os AwefulSecond battling other players just isnt fun AT ALL, everyone is using the same decks, the same strategies. What its come down to is the only thing determining the winner in VS is the one who gets the better starting hand (in other words luck, or in this case a flawed random generator) where as normally your deck strategy/in the moment decision making would decide the victor ...I also want to add this game has false advertising ALL OVER IT, at launch they made the game sound like something completely different than what it turned out to be and with held a GREAT amount of information from customers regarding deck creation. Wait what? ..i thought the game didnt have deck creation. Well that's right it doesnt but they sure as hell advertised it as if it did. Instead what you are given is 40 card limt deck option made using 10 random booster pack, and guess what? if that deck turns out to be crap or the the wrong color type, tough, your stuck with it ...oh wait but it gets better, if you want to make another deck and try again you cant can't. They wont let you delete the deck you just made and if you want to try again you have to spend $2.00 for another deck slot once more no guarantee that you get ANY! of the cards you desire.DO NOT BUY THE DLC the decks lack  massive amounts of creatvity and are not fun or interesting in anyway, it is a complete waste of money ....Zero effort was put into it.Caution Magic 2015: Wizzards of the coast is an incredibly money hungry company with one purpose in mind; to get you buying extra crap you dont need, booster packs, deck add ons, deck slots, and if they weren't they would be offering a fully functioning magic the gathering experience with all cards for a one time fee of 90 bucks or something ...but nope, they want you spending-spending-spending. A pre ordered copy of the magic 2015 was given to me by a friend so ill let you know how it turns out, but im willing to bet my left nut that they will be up to the same old sneaky♥♥♥♥♥♥TCG pro tip from a pro player:Gambling, i mean buying booster packs is VERY addictive (see what i did there) and something you should always be thinking about when playing TCG (trading card games). Trust me i understand/know the feeling of ""not"" knowing what that next booster pack will contain, the surprise, the excitement, and the wonderful smell of freshly purchased booster box/packs meets no equal. All those wonderful highly addictive toxic chemicals.Ask your self this ...if your playing TCG games with friends or tournament out of love for the game why are you spending thousands of dollars on it? essentially throwing your future down the toilet. If your just playing with friends or even tournament i recommend this. Buy a good printer for around 90 bucks and print all the cards you want from the internet; you and your friends will have access to what ever they need to come up with awesome deck combos etc, etc, and when your ready to play the big boys in tournament you will know Exactly what to buy for that special deck you just made saving you thousands of dollars; use old crummy cards in deck sleeves to support the printed out paper card (because paper is very flimsy and hard to work with), if you dont have any search ebay for random lot of common cards you can get around a 500 for just a few dollars.

There were two giant rule violations in the first 2 battles you go into.  There's one deck that included over 10 of the same creature card (You can only have a maximum of 4 of a unique card other than basic lands in your deck).  The rule for damage allocation for combat phases was completely off.

I get the rules, I play casually with friends. This isn't my introduction into Magic or anything. I also play a few other TCG's so I'm not entirely clueless either.The tutorial is a cakewalk, up until the final battle: Chandra. You're sitting on a deck you can't alter with a list that will let you play one card a turn if you're lucky while she always has something up her sleeve. Five or six battles against her and the closest I got to beating her was getting her down to about half her damage. All that took was her not playing anything. Afterwards the AI woke up and stomped me, I didn't get a single damage down afterward and the dead draws started happening because, hey, a 4+ cost enchantment is really cool, except when you have no creatures to use it on.Sealed started off pretty good. I got a deck that wasn't too bad and stomped Liliana even though she had death touch and murders up the wazoo. Then came Garruk (the owner of the deck you use in the tutorial) who proceded to consistently beat me. Why doesn't his deck start off like that for the tutorial? Or is my draw luck really just that bad? The one thing I will give them is that, even at Archmage, the AI is really good. If they have you, they know they have you. You have a first striker you're leaving untapped since it can block anybody they have and survive? They'll wait until they get the card they have somehow destroy it (for Chandra, this is practically every card).As for the other aspects of the game, the mechanics aren't that bad. A minor annoyance in this category is the animations. I turned them off, yet the combat animations still seem to be pretty slow. I don't need to see the creature bite/burn/slash/stare at whatever they're attacking, just the damage. Sealed is pretty fun, though it's not going to ever be the same as a draft. Yet, they seem to be worried that it will compete with the actual game. With how frustrating the AI and preconstructed decks are, they have nothing to worry about."

Now to the bugs - the game freezes mid game as if you're waiting on someone to make a choice, but it never will go through, until everyone leaves and restarts the match. That happens about 40% of the time. The other times you aren't able to play instant cards when you try to.

Chandra's deck in the previous installment could literally be played with no creatures...Jace's mill deck was surprisingly fun, and the demons of Liliana's were brutal and made for some interesting happenings.What I have played of this, and of the 5-6 decks I have played...each deck is LITERALLY the exact same.  Well...not exact, but they all follow a basic premise...mana ramp, play big creature, win with big creature.  Even the non-green (the color best known for mana-ramping) followed this pattern.  Whichever side dropped the bombshell first, won.  And the time I've played, only one deck acheived this on a consistent basis for you.  The AI pretty much cheats it's way to beating your face in.The campaign itself only unlocks a handful of decks.  In order to unlock the myriad of others, you have to play a ""revenge"" mode, where you re-fight all the people you fought...with better versions of their decks.  And then, you encounter and unlock the other missing 10341 decks you didn't get before.  So much grind, such hassle.  Or, you know, the alternative exists...pay them real money to eliminate the grind...which also destroys much of the (non-existent) fun of facing new decks with what you have and winning.This was the first DotP I did NOT enjoy in any sense.  I gave up on the campaign after losing repeatedly with the two decks I had at my disposal.  Eventually, i did succeed and tried other decks, only to find that I couldn't win ANY matches without using one specific deck, period.

You can't even make your own custom deck, you HAVE to use the decks they give you. If you have ten dollars to blow, sure go ahead and buy it.

Then I started clicking around, and I went into STEAM'S Community Guides, and I noticed that in order to win the ""Phantom Mage""achievement, a fellow has to win a game controlling only illusions . This aroused my curiosity, as I was all ticked off about the lack of usefullnes of the illusion spells in Skyrim (unless you go with all the perks), so I went into downloadable content and found the Deck Key for ""Mind Maze"", which would allow a fellow to compass this mighty task .

The new drafting mode is an interesting and refreshing style of play that has been well waited for. One of the less exciting changes to the game is the make over that has been done to the HUD. Oddly they have chose to go for a lighter and brighter theme as opposed to the darker more metallic version of the previous entry. It isn't a bad choice but the bright blue is a bit distracting. Another aspect of the game that is a favorite of mine is the DLC decks that come every once in a while, this time around they are all pretty good, but personally I don't find them as interesting and unique as previous DLC decks. Overall the game is really fun especially if you can play with a few friends, a definite buy if you liked the last one or want to get prepped for DOTP 2015."

I've had the time of my life with this game any my friends, but the developer decided to move on to new versions and broke the previous versions enough so they have become unplayable. Consindering you have to either pay, or spend countless hours to full unlock all decks, this seems like a timesink. I have been playing MTG the card game since 2002 and had a good time. I've probably spent $10k at least in cards trying to complete certain decks. But this has gone out of control. That a company retroactively ♥♥♥♥s up a game to make it unplayable so you upgrade and play with a) cards you don't care about b) rules you don't care about c) changing existing cards around, just makes it unsupportative for me.

,Recommended,213850,10929587,"Posted: 28 June, 2014",all,Snacky Chan,"NOTE - This review isn't so much about the game but the decks featured. I don't have enough space for each expansion deck.The base game comes with 10 decks. These decks range in colour and strategy, but some are clearly better than others:WHITEGuardian's of Light - This deck heavily features aura's and others spells that work well with aura's. It doesn't have very much removal, so it relies on the strength of its own creatures... or really, creature. It usually attacks with just one creature that  can usually be chump-blocked. Thankfully, the deck has a good number of creature's or aura's with lifelink so you can stay in the game whether they chump-block or not. However, if your one super-powered creature is killed through removal, it's hard to come back. Losing a creature and 2+ aura's from just one spell means more mana-efficiency for them.Overall, a very strong deck if your opponent can't remove your creatures.Avacyn's Glory - This deck's strength comes from numbers - and removal. This is a white weenie deck basically made from the Innistrad block. The deck works like a well-oiled machine, but can breakdown if a wrench is thrown in. This deck, if played perfectly, can win in a few turns. It can also play the long game with spells like Baneslayer Angel, and obviously, Avacyn herself. One of the reasons why this is one of the strongest decks is because it has many removal spells. This means this deck can stop creature decks in their tracks.Unfortunately, many of the best cards in this deck can only be unlocked if you buy the extra unlock key.Without the unlock key, the deck is one of the strongest in the game.BLUEMind Maze - Despite the name and Jace's usual mill deck strategy, this is a highly aggressive Illusion tribal deck. The deck is mostly creature-based and can win very quickly. The big problem is most of the creatures have the ""if targetted, sacrifice"" clause. This can be a problem if your opponent has creatures and spells that can target your creatures. This deck has a few counterspells and a few freeze spells, but mostly relies on its strong agressively-costed glass cannons.BLACKDeadwalkers - This deck is a rather basic zombie deck that is very dangerous. Many of its creatures are expendable and can also come back from the grave. This deck also has 19 pieces of removal, and can keep killing your opponents creatures while it slowly withers away at their health. Some of the removal, like Tendrils of Corruption and Corrupt, also give this deck some  lifegain.All in all, this deck is probably the strongest of the base game decks.REDFirewave - This is Chandra's usual burn deck. It features a few Phoenix's with a decent bit of damage spells. While this deck can be good at removing small threats, it really suffers when dealing with anything bigger than a 4/4. It doesn't feel like it has any set strategy, and kind of stumbles between burning your opponent and punching them.It does get bonus points for its strength in multiplayer games.GREENHunter's Strength - This deck can be summed up with just ""creatures"". While it lacks a real direction, this deck can have its moments. It has a few pieces of situational removal and can overpower the game very early on. As the game draws on, the deck slows down a bit and the agressively-costed Kalonian Tusker's and Garruk's Companion's feel like dead-draws. The decks main drawback is that it has very little mana ramp, despite being a mono-green deck.The deck gets a lot better once you've unlocked a few more cards, but evolve beyond ""Play Creature; Attack with Creature"".Overall, a decent deck, but can be foiled by a bit of removal.Chant of the Mul-Daya -This deck is a fascinating ramp deck that has a few big stompy creatures to finish off. This deck really falters early game and can lose without playing anything good if you don't ramp your land fast enough. However, once you've got 6+ lands, the deck gets really dangerous. It has a few All is Dust's, which can really turn the game around. This deck suffers to most from removal. Even if you've ramped up to 12 lands by turn 7, you'll probably only have 2 big creatures that don't really have any means of protecting itself from solid removal like Doom Blade or Oblivion Ring. This deck is probably the best deck at top-decking a means of winning, though.In the end, this deck is the strongest if your opponent doesn't play any removal.MULTI-COLOUREDSliver Hive - Probably one of the most anticipated decks of the game, this White/Red/Green deck is a relatively new imagining of the Slivers from M14. This deck features a bunch of Sliver's as well as some mana ramp and small bits of removal. On paper, it seems like a strong deck. This deck can win quickly if you get all of the pieces assembled quickly and efficiently. However, this deck suffers once one of the Slivers are destroyed. Since they all build off each other, removing one can mean the difference. Even if they have no removal, you might still be unable to deal with them if they have one bigger creature than yours.This deck gets a little off-focus when you add more of the unlocked cards. While this can diversify the deck, you start to lose your win condition as you start veering off the Sliver strategy.Masks of the Dimir - This deck is basically a Black/Blue control deck. Its main focus is on discarding your opponents cards from their hand and chipping away at their health. Unfortunately, this deck really doesn't know what it wants to be: It doesn't have enough removal to really stop big threats and it doesn't have any counter spells to really control how your opponent plays. The only victories I've earned for myself was through attacking with my 4/4 flyer. Once it's killed, I rarely win afterwards.A really disappointing deck; one of the weakest in the game.Enter the Dracomancer - This Black/Red/Green deck's main focus is playing dragons. This deck has a decent bit of ramp spells that go into the few dragons (7) the deck starts with. It has a few weenies that can protect you and deal small bits of damage, but after a while, they're only good for chump blocking. They can later be used for the few cards that can Devour them.Similar to Slivers and Mono-Green ramp, this deck gets bowled over once you've destroyed the few big creatures this deck plays. Devouring the weenies sounds like the right thing to do, but it actually helps your opponent pin-point which creature to destroy. Removal is minimal in this deck.This deck does get better once you've unlocked more cards, but initially, this deck is weaker than the Dimir deck.So there you have it: the initial ten decks this game offers. I hope this helps you decide whether this is the right version of Duels of the Planeswalkers or not.I've even taken the liberty to rank the decks personally, based on how well each deck has played against each other:1. Black - Deadwalkers2. White - Glory of Avacyn3. Blue - Mind Maze4. Green - Chant of the Mul Daya5. White - Guardians of Light6. Green - Hunter's Strength7. White/Red/Green - Sliver Hive8. Red - Firewave9. Black/Red/Green - Enter the Dracomancer10. Black/Blue - Masks of the Dimir"

There are a few that are fun to play (Dodge & Burn being my personal favorite), but most seem very simple. I miss the Landfall deck from a couple years back... Jace's deck is pitiful compared to year's past... And most just don't seem to have much flare to them.WotC is trying really really hard to put a story to MTG, but it is pointless and unecessary. The Planeswalker idea is dumb and needs to go away.So, be as it is. It's another year of premade decks. Again, the sealed play is fun, couch co-op 2-headed giant is fun, and there are more decks this year.REMEMBER- They are not going to make it to where you can make any deck from scratch... you can already do this with hteir actual online MTG, so why would they want you to be able to do the same thing for 10 bucks? Go buy some starter packs and boosters and get started making decks on their actual MTG Online game.

The campaign is set up very bizarrely, where the AI always draws the same cards in the same order, and seemingly always has a counter to anything that you do.  Possibly the worst part of this game, though, is that it straight up ignores the rules from time to time, such as not destroying lands when a destroy all permanents card is played.  Really, the best possible outcome for a Magic game would probably be the rules of Magic mixed with the production value and flow of Hearthstone.  Just sayin."

They reduced the ammount of decks you start with to only green deck and red deck from the tutorial, meaning you have ♥♥♥♥♥♥ decks.They also increased the ammount of games you have to win to unlock the entire deck, on 2013 version you could unlock 2-3 of the same card if they were the same card, but this one you have to win 30 games to unlock 30 cards even if they have repeating cards on the deck.So overall they increased the grinding everywhere so people buy paid unlock decks.All this is to make people to buy the paid unlock deck option.

I'm still playing this awesome game now, I spend 2-3 hours each day for things dealing with MtG.Regarding this game, it's clearly not the paper game.- The pool of cards is not that wide, you have to play with a restricted amount of available cards, which is annoying.- I'm pretty sure that some IA opponents have pre-determined patterns : there are playing the same cards in the same order, game after game. It's not that fun to know what's coming next, especially when you play a game that involves a random aspect ...- The interface isn't great and doesn't allow you to use all of the mechanics of the game. In particular, it's not quite painful to use the stack.But, in the end, this is still Magic, a great game, and you will have fun to spend around 20 hours to unlock all of the achievements.

Therefore I can tell when the game is fixed. The opponent you are playing against is controlled by the computer. Therefore, if it doesn't want you to win, you won't win. For instance, if you're playing against a blue deck and he's used tons of counters and you have your most powerful creature right in your hand and you cast him because you know he can't have anymore counters, guess what? One more counter! The controls are awkward and clunky too. It's hard to understand how to block and attack because you have to go through at least 3 ""are you sure you want to attack"" screens."

It feels like they prepared the first part of the game well, but began rushing it for release; I don't know why: a game like this could withstand an extra year of development, take advantage of new cards being released, and use the time to add maybe triple the levels. There's some nice ideas here, but it's overall too short; especially with the amount of stuff to unlock: there's not enough gameplay here to use even a third of it at all really, unless you're really into multiplayer.As far as gameplay, this game does a fair job of showing you the rules and helping you progress through each step correctly. However, there's no way to queue an action: more than once, while defending, I've wanted to enhance one of my monsters with an instant spell; you can't cast a spell specifically while choosing your defenders, yet the window of time before the attack starts--and you can't use a spell during the actual attack--is so short, that I've often missed it, even while trying to use the card as soon as I'm able. You have to endure this ""wait window"" over and over throughout the duel, and it's tedius; yet when I actually want to make use of the window, there's always some animation just before it starts, and then there's no kind of alert the window has started ticking by, so it seems as soon as I try to use my spell, it's already too late! Or too early! It's not like I want a longer window in this game, but it's so frustrating when the enemy plays a spell and I'm going to play a counter to that spell but they're still in their casting process so I can't actually cast mine yet, so I wait, for, what, I'm not really sure when one step ends perciesly; next thing I know it's too late! After playing through the campaign, I think I only had a 50/50 success rate for using a spell when the window was relevent. It's easily the most frustrating thing about this game.It's fun, and an easy way to play Magic, but there are freeware multiplayer Magic programs that allow a much broader selection to play with, so there's really very little reason to actually play this one. If only the campaign for this game had been developed more--or if the multiplayer had more cards you could choose from--it could be a good game. It's still fun, and worth the fair price, but this is definetly some distance from the premiere Magic experience."

Anyone who's even remotely interested in MTG should give this a try. it is a great way to get back into the game if its been a while or even if you are an active player it can be a fun way to experiment with the different card mechanics, test decks and you will enjoy the Planeswalker story in the campaign that is starting to really flesh out into a pretty cool story. it offers some interesting motivation to your games that are already very engaging. The nice thing about MTG is you can draw perfect cards or the worst cards from your library and lose either way. It takes intelligence to win and excercising that with the hand you are dealt is supremely engaging and satisfying. losing is sometimes frustrating but when you finally get your opponent down with a strategy that you engineered yourself it is extremely rewarding!"

You can easily learn the rules at your pace and see some examples of particular strategies. If you like it, you can consider starting with the actual card game, which will give you the freedom this game lacks.The second thing you might use this game for is if you already are a Magic player and want the chance to try out some thematic decks. This way you can save yourself a lot of time and money.Magic 2014 simply isn't the best game in the series for either.The first Duels of the Planeswalkers is your best choice if you want to try out Magic, as it is much more beginner-friendly than this one.Magic 2013 is, on the other hand, the best choice if you want to try out some fun decks, not only beacuse it had the Archenemy mode.In conclusion, Magic 2014 is not bad, but perhaps not the best choice if you want to buy a Duels of the Planeswalker game."

I'll say it right at the beginning: this game is completely useless unless you're a beginner at Magic and want to learn the ropes.So, the good:- The user interface in general is really nice and works well, but it has some glaring issues- The campaign is cool, with a series of fixed-strategy encounters plus a dynamic AI encounter for each chapter-The battle mechanics are well made but I suspect a couple of bugs are out there- The dlc's are just there to make you unlock stuff faster, you can do everything ingame without problems.And that's it. Now, the bad:- There's no hot seat mode. What the hell? This is mandatory. You can only fight against AI or on internet multiplayer.- this is a big one: YOU CANNOT CUSTOM BUILD DECKS. Straight out impossible. That's like 90% of the fun in magic, and they took it out. Main reason why the game is good only as a learning tool but other than that it's useless.- while building decks the filter tools are downright lacking and having to scroll through the cards is a pain. Plus, after every won encounter, when you unlock a card it gets AUTOMATICALLY added to the deck, so you have to scroll and remove it every goddamn time.- in general it's just barebones. You fight with basic decks against the AI, or against internet opponents, that's it. There's a sealed combat option where you unpack cards and build random decks but it's just there to remind you ""you could build custom decks, only we decided not to let you""That's it. Worth 9€ if you're new, ignore it if you ever played more than a couple of matches of Magic. I don't feel like playing multiplayer only with pre-made decks, it kills the fun of it."

,Not Recommended,213850,13308238,"Posted: 10 December, 2014",all,BDA,"I am a brand new player of MtG, and I found this game very helpful in learning the rules and tactics of the game. I'm glad to say that it isn't as complicated as I had thought it would be, and I'm really looking forward to diving in to the world of tabeltop MtG now that I understand a bit more about how certain themes and decks operate, and that is largely thanks to Magic 2014 - Duels of the Planeswalkers.However, I'm sad to report that this game only gave me the briefest taste of the action, and fell well short of leaving me satisfied. As a brand new player feeling this way, I can only imagine that veteran MtG fans will be left disappointed. Once I had beaten the shot campaign (which is comprised of a series of duels against static enemies who always draw the same cards, in the same order), and felt I had a pretty good grasp of how certain cards could synergize with each other, I was disappointed to see that there wasn't much of an option to build my own deck and experiment. The only exception to this is the sealed deck mode, where you are given a small number of random cards, and can earn up to three booster decks to craft your own deck. However, this feels almost completely pointless, as once you have unlocked the three booster packs (For a total of 9 packs, I believe), there is no way to unlock any more. You're stuck with what you have. Like it or not. Your only options after that point are to continue fighting the same battles you already fought, but without the rewards.Overall, I'd say that Magic 2014 is a decent purchase if you're brand new to the game, and just looking for a stage to learn the rules of the game, and have a chance to play around with premade decks to learn a few possible tactics. If you were hoping for the possibility of actually building your own decks, though, then you should probably stable your expectations."

Although it does take some of the customization off in the computer version it is still very enjoyable. If you love magic as much as I, you sure should but it, especially now with the sale on 75%.There are 2 different modes to play it. There are sealed and there are normal game mode.Though, when you play normal you don't make decks from scratch. Instead you get a standard deck in which you can improve and customize with 40 extra cards for the specific deck. These cards are locked from start but can be unlocked while playing.In the normal gamemode you play through a campaign. The campaign contains about 5 worlds with each 4 duels to play. 3 of these duels are scripted while the last ""boss"" in each world draws cards randomly from his deck, just like you. When you win a duel you will get an additional card for the deck you played with. When you win a duel against a ""boss"" you will get an additional deck.If you're looking for customization there is still a bit of that, as you can play sealed game. Sealed game is when you get 6 booster packs, each containing about 15 cards and build a deck with at least 40 cards. As you play throw a very challenging campaign, about 6-7 duels or so, you can get 3 additional boosters.You only have 2 slots for these kinds of decks, but if you want you can buy 1 more.Final score: 4/6"

76561197967900181,Recommended,213850,10408152,"Posted: 9 June, 2014",all,Brandon,"I find this game to be a bit of a quandary. I love Magic, in all it's forms. I have been playing for almost 20 years off and on. It is indeed one of my favorite gaming obsessions. I love the game mechanics, the artwork, the deluge of new releases brought to us by Wizards each year. These are all fantastic things. However, and this is what makes a review for this game difficult, I think people miss the point with what Duels is trying to accomplish. This game is not made for the hardcore IRL Magic player. It is made for the casual fan, or perhaps even a beginner wondering what the game is all about. Don't get me wrong, the challenges and sealed deck play inclusive of this edition are geared at a more experienced player, but, minus those, this is an attempt to get people into the game.Thus far, you may be wondering where I'm actually going to recommend this game, well patient reader, you have reached that fork in the road. I will very much recommend this game as it serves the prospective player on many different fronts.For one thing, I have difficulty finding real life games of Magic to play. I have a busy and odd work schedule that prohibits me from being able to play at my local hobby and game stores. This fills the need nicely. One could say that Magic Online would be a better option, however, that title, though I do enjoy it, is a much more difficult entry to get into. The process of finding games is difficult, as is the ability to compete with others that have incredible collections to work with. I don't want to spend money forever just to have a chance to win a game. Duels gives players the opportunity to pop in and play a game quickly without the meta game that goes along with real Magic or MGO. I will provide no argument that the act of building quality decks is a huge part of the game. For me it is possibly more enjoyable than playing. I love looking through my cards and trying to come up with that next killer combo of cards. But, in adult life I rarely find the time to sit with countless cards at a table and do just that, or perhaps I just don't find it to be important enough to make the time. I don't know.Regardless, this is a decent digital representation of a fantastic game. It gives quick play ability. The sealed deck mode gives decent, albeit limited, deck building for the first time in a Duels entry. The challenges, for me anyway, are indeed challenging, and very fun. I really enjoy the puzzle aspect of the challenges, and they are quick enough that you will want to try again and again until you beat them. I will admit I have not tried this year's campaign mode, nor the multiplayer, however, neither of those was my primary reason for purchase. I bought this for the Sealed Deck play. I wanted to see what they would do with it. While it isn't like playing for real, that's what MGO is for, it is a reasonable alternative at a much cheaper price point. I think it will likely be a good point for them to improve on with next year's edition.I just want to end this with one more point to be made. A lot of negative reviews are being written about this game. I urge interested parties to download the demo before purchasing. This will give you a chance to see if it's for you. It may or may not be. I have a feeling that most of these negative reviews are being written by people expecting too much. No Magic product for $10 is going to give you a huge assortment of cards to work with, nor the ability to build custom decks to your hearts content. This product sits in a particular category for the Magic franchise and people need to understand that. If you want all the cards and the best multiplayer, go online and get Magic: The Gathering Online. If you want an interesting take on things in a quick and easy format, or want to learn to play the real thing, this is an excellent starting point.Because everyone gives everything a number rating on here, I'm going to do the same.  8/10"

The way they 'rate' the decks is poor, because it isn't based on numbers of creatures, lands, size of deck, anything.  I made a deck in RL that was only spells, and it beat 90% of its opponents, handely, and without having a redraw.  This game only allows tournament rules with mitigated rules on number of cards of a name allowed.I play old school, 4 cards of a name to a deck except lands.  This game showed me and proved that 5 or more of a card can be used of the same name, which isn't tournament, but giving only one redraw of 7, then degrading down a card each redraw is tournament.

,Recommended,213850,9652222,"Posted: 28 March, 2014",all,Total Liability,"For those that said this version is just a cash-grab, you really have to think of the business model that M:TG uses. Small payments, often. With that said, there is a whole lot of content to be consumened within the £6.99 base version of the game for many many hours of play. In all fairness, most of the cards can be unlocked without spending more than the price of the game. After that one or two payments of £1.99 will have you pretty much the complete set. Now with that out of the way, I will  admit that nothing much has changed since Magic 2013, and that's no bad thing, it's just more of the same with this year's cards. If you're a Magic fan, you'll drop huge chunks of time on this, if you're not, you'll pick it up fast and begin your addiction. The only thing that annoys me is that they havent made the UI any more intuitive this time around. After playing Hearthstone and throwing my cards around the screen, and going back to this, it feels very clunky and having to click tiny buttons on the left of the screen really halts the pace. Also, not being able to drag and drop cards on each other is an issue that should have been addressed for 2014. Overall, cracking game. Can't wait for M15!"

I finished almost the whole campaign+revenge with a single deck and didn't even fully unlock it.In a world where free-to-play Hearthstone exists this kind of game is absolutely unacceptable. And don't get me wrong - Hearthstone doesn't even come close to Magic:TG - the card game, but compared to this video game incarnation it's an absolute winner in every category possible (well, except the card art, but that is again thanks to M:TG - the card game).I wouldn't recommend this to anyone, even on sale.

Whatever its other flaws, Magic 2014 is fun to play.HOWEVER, it's another cash grab in a series that peaked two iterations ago. If you want to try out magic, buy 2012. This version is engineered to trick you into paying money. Unlocking cards is a chore, deliberately so, in the hope you'll give up playing the game in favour of paying to win. Each card in each deck is unlocked individually, whereas the decks in 2012 would unlock multiple cards of the same name, so that unlocking decks was a delight.Worse still is the sealed deck system, dangled in front of us as in incentive to buy into this money farm. As you're hopefully aware, you get two sealed decks (which is no problem), you can buy more (which is fine and dandy), but you CAN'T EVER RESET THEM. That's right, you play with them once, and you're stuck with them permanently. Again, Wizards of the Coast decide to take huge slashes to replayability, value, and fun in order to try to get you hooked.I've followed the series from the original, and the fun I've had with 2012 has kept me coming back until now. WotC has made it very clear that we, the gamers, are not important to them. You are essentially paying them $10 for an advertisement.

I personally like it, and it's not hard to get the hang of once you learn how to play the basics. I do reccomend playing the tutorial if you're a newcomer to the game, but otherwise, you can skip the tutorial if necessary. As you play the ""planes"" (Which are like chapters in the story), you unlock new decks to play with. You may be wondering ""How do I unlock Jace's/Ajani's/Liliana's deck?"". To that, my friend, I have your solution. Click the little planeswalker button in the corner to duel the default five planeswalkers--Chandra, Garruk, Jace, Ajani, or Liliana. As you beat the planes, you can unlock one planeswalker to challenge. I reccomend leaving Jace for last, or until you learn how to play your deck really well.  Anyway, my review score-wise would have to be a solid 9/10, as Magic does have some of it's flaws, but most of them aren't big. And if you lose it's your fault, for screwing up.

I have completed the campaign, the puzzle challenges and a sealed play campaign, so this is what I now build my small review on.The campaign is not very long, and I must admit that I did not care for the story at all. But it is fun, and the decks you play against, and the decks you unlock, play different and are really fun! It does appear that some decks are slightly OP compared to others, but I have not played online yet, so that is not really a problem thus far.The puzzles are either really easy, or rather difficult, but even for a newcomer like me, they were all managable. But they are fun and a welcoming break to the regular gameplay. It would be fun if they expanded on this.As far as I have understood, the ""Sealed Deck"" gameplay, is what it's all about now. It is really fun to be able to put your own deck together, and I reckon it is a part of the game that really feel like the offline play. But I feel kinda limited, and would like to be able to create more decks, before I hit a paywall.When I write this, I am 17,8 hours into the game, and I have not even unlocked one complete deck yet, and I have not touched online multiplayer either.

76561197973129601,Recommended,213850,9292909,"Posted: 28 February, 2014",all,StefanWB,"Ok, so here's the deal.Yes, compared to actually playing Magic: The Gathering with friends or at your local game shop, and compared to playing the fully fleshed out MTG Online, the Duels of the Planeswalkers series provide an experience that is demonstrably less rich and varied, and only includes a fraction of the real MTG experience. People are right to criticise the game's lack of proper deck building, and to bemoan the list of features that every DOTP iteration excludes (I appreciate Sealed as a chance to let new players try a Limited format, but I'd have much preferred they brought back Archenemy from Magic 2012).But while those criticisms are valid, let's address the many extremely positive features of these games, and dissect how they perfectly fulfil the purpose that Wizards of the Coast intended them to - letting people try the Magic experience in a more structured and easily digestable format.First off, Magic: The Gathering is an expensive hobby. You either have to keep up with the expansions (one big core expansion annually, and one expansion block made up of three smaller expansions), spending lots of money on packs in hopes of getting the cards you really want or diving into the world of buying individual specific cards, or you're spending money in MTG Online, buying digital packs of cards or buying/earning tickets to enter Limited events.Magic 2014, by comparison, is currently retailing on Steam for £7, with a £4 expansion and three deck packs of £2 each. For the price of 4-5 booster packs, which each give you 15 cards (10 commons, 3 uncommons, 1 rare or mythic rare, and 1 land), you have access to hundreds of cards from Magic history, some of which are extremely rare and valuable IRL. As a value proposition, there is no better way to dip one's toe into the wonderful world of MTG.Which brings me to my second major point; sure, the DOTP games don't have proper deck-building, but for a lot of people, that's probably a good thing. Let's face it, Magic can be pretty overwhelming and daunting for new players - you may even say that if Magic itself was a card, it would have Intimidate! If you get that joke, then maybe DOTP is not for you, but plenty of people won't get that joke, and Wizards/Stainless essentially designed the DOTP series for those players.Magic: The Gathering is experiencing something of a renaissance in recent years, and so naturally more people who either haven't ever played Magic or haven't played it for a very long time may be tempted to try and get into Magic. Where should those people start? Wizards makes lots of starter decks and boxes that are designed for new players, but that's more expensive and much more restricted than DOTP. One of the true joys of the MTG experience is building your deck, but it can be totally overwhelming for a newbie because there are so many cards that do so many different things and so many potential strategies and tactics.And this is where the Duels of the Planeswalkers games shine. You have a starting point - 5 mono-coloured starter decks, one for each colour - and from there the game opens up and you unlock more decks and unlock more cards for each deck. It's a very controlled environment that allows you to try out each deck to see which is most to your liking, build familiarity with a chosen deck, and customise said deck by winning matches and unlocking cards. By doing this, players will gain a better understanding of core mechanics and the functional differences between the colours, and will see that deck building is about balance and focusing on a set of mechanics, rather than trying to do everything. The mono-white Ajani deck is very focused on enchantments and lifegain, and players can see how a deck can be built around a single mechanic, and experience the advantages and disadvantages of that deck type. The game even presents players with deck ratings, which demonstrates which decks have the biggest creatures, which decks have the most flexibility, which decks are the fastest, and which decks include the most card synergy.My third and final point is that Duels of the Planeswalkers gives players - both experienced and inexperienced - something that the base game doesn't always provide; a focus and a structured progression. The game has multiple campaigns to complete, many challenges to test your understanding of certain mechanics, and more. This all helps in giving new players a chance to experience the game while unlocking new cards for their favourite decks along the way. One last quick thing to say is that I don't know if there's a better way to play Magic against a non-human opponent; the AI isn't always great, but being able to play against the AI is great for people who, like myself, don't have friends to play Magic with and isn't always keen about playing the game online.So let me boil down my arguments to one fundamental truth: how much value you will get out of Magic 2014 DOTP correlates directly with your familiarity with Magic: The Gathering. If you've been playing and collecting for years, or are deeply invested in Magic Online, then by all means feel free to totally ignore these products; they're not for you. If, however, you're totally or relatively new to Magic, then I can't think of a much better place to start than this. I speak from personal experience: the DOTP games are what got me into Magic. A few years ago, I knew very little about Magic, whereas now I'm getting ever increasingly absorbed into the culture of Magic, I have favourite colours (White and Green - Selesnya fo' lyfe!), and actually own physical MTG cards.The DOTP games are essentially designed as a gateway into the world of MTG. Don't criticise the gate because it isn't a cathedral, especially since it's a damn good gate that does it's job perfectly well. People need gates to get into places, and once they're inside they can start experiencing the ""true"" depth, insanity, and wonder of the world's first and best CCG."

It's roughly equivalent to the old MicroProse game (for those who remember that), only without the random encounters and with better gameplay mechanics in the duels.  It has a campaign mode with around 20 matches to fight which provides a reasonable level of challenge.It also has free-for-all or two-headed giant dueling against computer opponents or online players.  This is limited in that either one uses the prebuilt decks (with any unlocked cards and limited user modification) or the sealed decks.  The prebuilt decks all seem reasonably balanced; though inevitably some are a bit weaker than others, I've been able to win with every deck against every deck.  Sealed deck play is also limited; one gets only two sealed decks (that cannot be reset) unless one pays for extra slots.  As this would mostly be of interest for dueling online opponents, it's probably not worth it for hardcore M:TG players.However, for those who are new to the game, or who (like me) are looking for just a taste of the game without getting back into the full ""I'm spending $150 on a booster box every four months"" addiction, it's a fun diversion."

The game is enjoyable and this time around you can modify the land count in your decks, even with this I feel it wasn't as good as Magic 2013.  Keep in mind it's all oppinion but I prefered the decks in the previous game over this one and the campaign in this one felt much easier, the final ""boss"" in this game was a joke leaving me extremely dissappointed with the campaign. The custom match options does not have planeschase like 2013 which was another huge dissapointment for me.The major new addition is the Sealed Play option, this gives you booster packs and using the cards inside of them you must build a deck. I found it fun but it's very flawed, obviously being random pulls you can get really lucky or really bad cards to work with. The major problem is you have two slots to work with and you cannot delete your deck, I understand many would delete there decks after there pull if they don't like there cards which would ruin the fun but I would like an option after I finish the sealed campaign but if you want to have more sealed campaigns from scratch you have to buy them using real cash, and to me that's a big let down.I would have liked an online sealed where so many players or AI go into a lobby and pull and make random decks and it works through tournament style. But this didn't happen and I felt this could have made the game so much better. Even with all I said I still reccomend this game to any fan of the card game because it is enjoyable and will get you through if you don't have anyone to currently play with."

The campaign is fun to play through and with all the effects and what not the game keeps you interested for a very long time. The computers that they provide for you to face make very clever decisions and will keep you on your toes constantly. I also love the puzzle mode where it will create a situation in a game where you need to win in the next end step. Though I am so upset that this game wasted a lot of it's potential by making these pre-made decks and FORCING you to use them. I would have spent hundreds of hours on this game if I could play with creating my own decks and facing people. But aside from that one huge downside this game is still so much fun like I said and there is a mode where you can build a deck known as draft mode where you will open up a couple of packs and build a deck. You then go on to face some more NPC's and you can earn three more packs by beating all of them. It allows you to customise your deck a bit more but not enough.

After you've unlocked a deck there's 40 cards for each deck to unlock (1 for every win). Note though that they're tied with the deck so you can't switch them around.Challengesis when you get a premade hand and cards on the board and an objective that you need to complete (usually on your current turn). The difficulty in the ""vanilla"" version is sadly extremely easy but the ones in the expansion thankfully requires a bit more thinking and planning.Sealed Deckwas what I looked forward to and when I bought this game I knew what the previous aspects had to offer and those were fine but the sealed deck was and still is a HUGE disappointment and I'd almost like to call it a ripoff.Here's how it works. You have two ""Sealed deck""-slots. When you start one you'll be given 5 ""boosters"" that contain a fixed amount of random cards. After that you got a small campaign where you can unlock 3 more boosters and so far it's great.The sealed campaign offer very little in the way of challenge and when you're done you are actually done.You can't get more cards for your deck(s) which is understandable and the main thing here is thatYou can't delete your sealed deck(s) and start over, ever!Otherwise, lots of achievements for a game this size, steam trading cards and a really smooth UI. Once all the card animations have been turned off in the option menu the game runs really smooth (as in it won't take ages to run the combat phase).Some other options I recommend turning off (or they might cost you quite a lot of games due to lack of control over things) are ""Simplified Targeting"", ""Order blockers Automatically"", ""Always Use Optional Abilities"" and ""Browse Entire Library"".You also might want ""Hold Priority"" turned on or the game will skip phases if you can't play cards or use abilities etc which is okey for single player but in Multiplayer you do not want your opponent to know that you can't do♥♥♥♥♥♥with what you got on your hand.Knowing this review sounds a bit harsh I got to sum it up by saying that all bad things considered it's still Magic the Gathering, easily the best Trading Card Game (TCG) I've ever played and, even though this game is limited, it still beats Hearthstone and SolForge by a mile as far as gameplay goes.I give this game 3/51 - Crap, don't buy2 - Fun for an evening3 - It's an alright game4 - Great game5 - One of the best I've ever played"

For players like myself, they get you up to speed with the current rules and move you on your way.For the most part, the game is enjoyable, but it does suffer from some slightly slow gameplay at times and the collection of cards can get tedious and feel a bit unrewarding unless you are willing to shell out the physical cash to buy the cards in a deck.

And as many as you want too.Even better is the ability to create any type of Magic card from scratch. Whether it's an existing card that's not in the game, or one you create from your mind. There is quite a learning curve to creating them, but there are hundreds of cards others have made already and have done the hard work for you. Even entire sets!Modded decks/cards even work online.

I originally started to play it with papercards and been playing now about 1,5 years. First standard (3 latest released sets) but changed to EDH (Elder Dragon Highlander) for much more casual gameformat. But on the DOTP version...Magic 2014: DOTP is awesome game for practising the basics of magic. The decks arent any superoverpowered, but enough good to give you some good tips and tricks how to every color could be built. Also its CHEAP way to get into magic. Depending on how you want to play (competitively or just kitchen table) the deck can cost quite a lot If really wanted to work on, even >100€. DOTP gives you already good working cards and for one single price. It also lets you try some drafting and teamplaying (2 headed giant).All in all, if you want to learn MTG, start from this. It also gives you some good way what colors are your favorite."

And that's where my praise ends.Duels of the Planswalkers is notoriously known for being a constricting way to actually play Magic.  In-game purchases for pre-made decks that have pre-determined cards for you to 'customize' with, and a predictable AI that doesn't strain any challenge is really discouraging for people that were hoping for a more flexible card game based in the Magic universe.If you're like me (relatively new to Magic but has some experience with playing in draft sessions and such), skip this.  Either go play Magic irl or buy the original Magic: The Gathering RPG by Sid Mier.  Otherwise, there's no harm getting this if it's on sale,  and if you're curious to learn how to play.

However this would make Sealed Play redundant and there is the fact that you're getting tons of cards in the game for very little money.

We were left to understand the rules by ourself. of course this meant that our personal interpretation was often taken as self-interest ! Resulted in endless confrontation and frustration.I started fro real with the 2010 PS3 version. Computers are great to teach you card games, no human interpretation. Sometimes the game wouldn't let you do something, that meant you misunderstood a basic rule. Even my bro came back to the game and we had lots of fun over the net, particularly on 2-headed giant.I could play all the decks with 50% chance of aquiring an additional card for one in 2 win. Very addicting.I know very little about programming, but I have a lot of experience with game making. I can assure you this is the simplest game you can program. The mechanics are decades old and playtested to the max, no further balancing is needed, the art litteraly copied from the card game. Why then do we get minor rehashed game engine year after year, buggy, unstable and slow (console is nearly unplayable due to loading).I'm not even talking about AI, there is none. You can fake AI with rules but in the end, unless you write a rule for every possible outcome, you will get consistent mistakes. ie: If you are overpowered (50 beasts at 10/10, 200 health) the AI will stop playing. The game won't crash but the AI will draw 1 card, and disard 1 card at the end of the turn, period.This is clearly a cash-in enterprise. It works. From what I can see, it runs on very limited resources. Bugs can only hope to be fixed in the next one or second advent. I have bought every game, hoping my experience would be improved by as little as 1%. It did. I can understand fixing the minor shortcomings would make this game 10 times more pricey to produce. Is it worth it? Of course not. But I strongly believe the community deserves it.With all this said, I still recommend Magic. Don't fall for the obvious cash-in tricks buried amongst the really cheap deck unlocks (who needs foiled cards?, wallpapers, soundtracks ?)"

From a returning player's standpoint, 2014 is by far an easier way to refresh one's memory of basic mechanics. However, no game is without drawbacks.- There is limited deck building. For a beginner, this is reasonable enough. However, building a deck is half the enjoyment of the game. Yes, in this regard one could simply buy a copy of DToP '15, but that is more money out of pocket.- Sealed slots are extra. Yes two slots for 40-card decks come with the game, however, as aforementioned, despite the slots being cheap, it is regardless money lost. Of course you could run only two decks, but the paper game is centered around experimentation. It would seem that way in Duels, but alas, it isn't.Regardless of micro-transactions, the game plays exceptionally well and newcomers will catch on quickly. I speak from experience.

As a fan of trading card games I had to give it a shot. The game has a perfect entry level and an excellent tutorial on how to actually play Magic. When the tutorial is done you start by playing the campaign, which has some really cool challenges and opponents. What I really like about this game is the fact that it runs really smooth, the card animations have a nice flow and some cards have cool effects. Another positive thing is the music, great, ambient background music that does'nt bother you while you're playing or thinking about your moves.The multiplayer mode is quite fun, you can play 1v1, 1v1v1v1 or the so called ""Two Headed Giant"" mode which is a 2v2 game. You can even play 2v2 with a friend against 2 CPUs (and their difficulty can be adjusted so it can be quite challenging as well).The game does not have create-your-own-deck function. however. You start with a basic deck and unlock some more decks to play with. And to play the sealed mode more than twice you have to buy new slots which kinda sucks.All with all the game is a really cool for either beginners or advanced magic players, and if you like trading card games this is a worthy addition to your game collection."

You get given very little choice and its expensive to buy more deck slots with no ability to erase you old ones.On the whole if you are new to magic or like a cheap and gentle way to play and explore without investing lots of money in cards this is a good buy.However if you rather a larger choice of cards at a higher cost mabye give this a miss."

After playing through the main and sealed deck campaigns, I've developed a much better understanding of MtG and had a lot of fun with the variety of decks I unlocked.  There are many things I like about M2014, but a few aspects that I disagree with.The interface is very intuitive and easy to use.  As a beginner, I found the ""More Info"" button to be very useful in explaining various game mechanics like Devour, Undying and First Strike.  Soundtrack is excellent and gets you pumped for the duel.The main campaign was fun, but I didn't like how the ""encounters"" (non-boss duels) were scripted so that the AI basically plays the same cards each time you duel against it (ahem, Sewers.  goddamn Sewers).  It was exciting to unlock a new deck at the end of each chapter, and though the plot was pretty basic it added a nice bit of flavour to each duel.  However, the final battle was disappointing to say the least.Sealed mode (where you get a bunch of random cards from boosters and build a deck from them) was fun in theory but M2014 put on a bunch of unnecessary restrictions.  The sealed campaign is short and allows you to unlock some more additional boosters, but other than that you're stuck with the cards you have.  You can only make up to two decks in sealed - any more and you'll have to buy additional slots.  Because of the limited number of cards you get for each deck (and the fact that you can't exchange cards between decks), I found myself stuck playing decks of the colours for which I had the best cards.  I wish they'd had a mode where you could just build a deck from any of the cards that you collected (including the unlockable decks), without any restrictions.Multiplayer with friends, of course, is always nice.  I've also had matchmade games with strangers, and those turned out alright too.  Two-headed giant (2v2) mode was super hectic fun.  In order to be somewhat more unique, you can customize your player avatar and title, and those are unlocked by doing certain deeds in the game (like achievements, but the objectives are different).Challenges are either easy or tricky puzzles, and the tricky ones helped me understand the mechanics of Magic a little better.Verdict: This is a decent Magic game, and you'll definitely get more out of it if you're a beginner.  The replay value wasn't as great as I expected, and experienced players can probably skip this one unless it's on sale. Either way, you may want to wait for a sale to pick this up.  I'm looking forward to seeing how M2015 will turn out."

It has the occasional game breaking glitch, and has a terrible dlc system in the form of sealed play slots.On the other hand, i'm hard pressed to think of anything else that Magic 2014 fails to accomplish.The game is beautiful, and it has near endless replay value. 21 decks exist in the game, although about half need to be bought as dlc (buy during a sale if you decide you like the game enough to do so!). Each deck has a radically different play style from the others, providing the basis for a solid multiplayer meta where decks tier differently and each have their various strengths and weaknesses (except Avacyn's Glory. that deck is broken as hell).The game's campaign is good fun to play through, and is very well paced. For a novice MTG player, it provides him with a good understanding of the game, gradually increasing in difficulty and complexity as it goes along. For the veteran MTG player, it's good fun in the sense that he gets to relive cards from across the history of magic, find out about card combinations he never thought of, and more. Just a warning: the balance of the tutorial boss battle is rather off, and you may end up having to retry it over and over. If this is your first DOTP game, like was the case with me, remember that you can edit your deck in the main menu to make this battle easier!Multiplayer has some issues where some people complain of connection difficulties. From my experience, connection issues do not occur when you go through the custom game menu or host your own game, whereas the quick game option is a headache to connect to. Occasionally games will hang halfway through - i suspect this happens when the host disconnects or lags out. There's no good fix for that and it has ruined a fair share of games for me. Very annoying when it happens, but otherwise multiplayer plays well enough to provide great fun. The community is very much alive, and you may end up remembering quite a few names that you see around often.There's real value for money in this game, especially if bought for sale like i did. It's definitely a better buy then paper Magic, anyway, where a good Standard deck could cost you $400 USD. Pick it up, have fun, and avoid Sealed Play like the plague."

,Recommended,213850,9001974,"Posted: 6 February, 2014",all,Lottabullets,"While it doesn't compare to paper magic, Duels 2014 is another great experience for entering into the wide universe that is Magic the Gathering. With the introduction of sealed mode, you get a sense for what its like to actually construct a deck from a pile of cards and make tough decisions on what to include and what to cut from your deck. All in all, its an enriched experience that does a good job of mirroring paper magic.Its hard to enjoy this game by itself as someone that loves the deckbuilding aspect of paper magic, and the competitive side. Without true deck customization from the get-go, this game is a tough sell for the hardcore Magic crowd. With that being said, there are plenty of third party mods to enable you the ability to create your own decks and utilize the deep cardpool found within the game.Some of the legacy issues that this series suffers from is the AI. If you aren't playing online, you are playing against an AI that stacks their deck (encounters), or comes up with the perfect draw on a situational basis (actual Planeswalker opponents). On the highest difficulty, it does make the game a little difficult to play and enjoy knowing that you are at a disadvantage right off the bat, but knowing that the AI is still very much beatable, and the fact that they walk into obvious traps even on the highest difficulty means that the game rewards you for playing smart, and punishes you for misplaying.This game certainly isn't for every magic fan out there, but if you want to have a gateway to learning magic the correct way, Duels has, and will be, the best way to learn the basics and build upon the basics. 8/10"

Your only real game styles are regular and Sealed, and the Sealed is very limited in that (without buying additional content) you only get one card pool to play with, meaning that the Sealed campaign has approaching zero replay value, since you get the same cards every time. There's no Arch Enemy, Planechase, or any other fun variants this time around.On the positive side, the campaign mode feels a lot more like an actual campaign mode now, rather than just a series of unrelated games. They have added a little bit of story, put in some narration, and made the ""final boss"" fight a lot more entertaining than in the previous games in the series. For example, there is no ""tinker a Mox into Darksteel Colossus on turn 1"" like in the original game.I'd say this game is a good fit if you are either a very new Magic player (what the game was really designed for), or you just liked the first two games in the series and ran out of stuff to do in them. That said, if you're just looking for a Magic game to play, I'd probably go with the 2013 version above this one."

The tutorial is insanely good, and the visual image of ""the stack"" is very good for people who have no clue how to visualize how spells resolve and in what order. I think the interface is very simple and easy to use for beginners and it would allow them to play some cards which are pretty expensive and that they would probably never get to play with like Umezawa's Jitte and Exploration.  The decks are not really balanced that well, I think.

You now have a bit more control over your deck. Sealed Play is hit or miss. The cards in your card pool are the same permanently even if you uninstall and reinstall the game due to it being generated based on your profile or something. You get 2 free Sealed Play slots with their own card pools, if you don't like the cards you get, you'll have to buy more slots if you want to play with different ones.I'd say it's worth it if you're looking for a few hours of fun and don't care too much about Sealed Play.

I've played the actual Trading Card Game before but it never meant enough for me to go out and spend all the time, money and effort on collecting decks you would spend to get what you get out of few bucks on this program. It's a quick campaign in that you can pretty much beat everything the game has to offer with opening one deck in about 25 hrs complete. But the fun it supposed to be in the challenge of learning all the decks that you unlock and how all their different pluses and minuses. SO then you figure to multiply that across the various decks thru the campaign. You do have to grind to get the decks to open up to their full potential, but what stat buidling game dont you anyway? So that's not really a valid point. I mean how much time would you spend in RL collecting all these cards anyway? Right now the entire season is available for less than what I would pay for a value meal, so as long as it's on sale I say go for it! I definitely wouldn't pay more than $10 for it though to be fair."

The UI's a little clunky; you juggle in and out of a lot of nested menus.  There are tool-tips for each ability & rule, but the application of certain mechanics aren't at all intuitive (I.E. ""Protection"" from a card color on a creature doesn't grant said creature immunity to that color of card, but instead makes them invisible/unblock-able to the specified color.).  There isn't much depth to single-player play, though I suppose that's to be expected from a game whose chief mechanic is crafted card decks."

It is only duels on table, that's it.I suppose I could live with that.I do not know if this is wrong but I started right off the bat with single player>campaign. I have to go through a tutorial and that is great but here is the deal. I have to beat up Chandra as last tutorial AI and she is plain unbeatable or it is meant from me to be playing a very particular and should I say a very peculiar way with no margin for error if I want to win because decks are not distributed randomly, it appears like there are several pre-fab deck distribution at least for AI which create this bubble gameplay/strategy and in my experience that this game is therefore deck instanciated! In other words, don't choose the wrong deck or simply lose fast, lose slow but lose anyway.Now as noted all way above, the gold complete offer the chance to choose from a vast variety of decks in campaign solo mode which I am happy but I cannot just choose 1 deck and jump to the next because I just lost.Last but not least... what are those 0 to 5 stars next to each pre-fab decks. I understand a couple of those values but others do not say or mean anything like creature size ( I assume the more stars the more ""monstruous/devastating"" creatures are), Deck speed ( I have no idea what this value is for ), Deck flexibility ( I assume the more flexible the more versatile the deck is), and finally card synergy is so far the biggest mystery in this game to me. You would guess that hovering the mouse would provide cues and clues but nope... nothing.Other players that are obviously more experienced stated the fact that sealed campaign is ""fun"" and I agree with them for the simple reason you start with 0 card and it feels like really opening those surprise packets. This said,  while I could beat Chandra with a purely Death base deck + 5 or 6 cards requiring any land types, it appears impossible to do so against Ajani. It really sound like I need to shuffle and build another deck to beat Ajani whom appears to me to have a good defensive base until that AI can just overwhelm the player.I am glad I caught this game while in promo and I recommend to anyone who want to try to actually buy it when it is in promotion. I feels to me the value is just right that way and not a penny more.The game appears easy to dive in and be familiar with the game mechanics but it takes some time to understand AI decks and even more time to get if your deck can even compete against the AI or should you do something about your deck.I am one of those old school perhaps but I am not prone to mix and match.Again I am noob at this game and it is a cool game but just not the same experience as the very first Magic The Gathering, although I am glad the franchise goes on :)"

It's also disappointing that deck building is so limited.Pros:-Many decks to choose from.-Many cards to unlock-Lots of content in the way of campaigns and challenges-Rewarding GameplayCons:-AI/RNG can stack against you. They will always get the cards they need 80% of the time, having an answer for whatever you play.-Sealed Cards are limited. Can only open a few packs, and you can't use your created deck in any other modes.-Gameplay can hang up on AI making decisions.

You can work your way through the single player and unlock decks and have a lot of fun playing them.

In multiplayer it becomes more interesting - essentially it's like playing constructed for real, you just don't have any control over what's in your deck (besides choosing one of the preset decks, for which you can unlock more cards by using it in single player).I enjoyed this very much, therefore... recommended."

The price is very fair for what you get -->  You get to learn how to play the most loved trading card game in the world and you don't have to spend tons of money, or research how to build decks.  There are MANY fun decks in this game.  Some bomb dropping decks, some toast them quick decks, some Zerg-like decks and even some to derail the enemy's plans.  A review I read said something about the music...     The music?...  Now for the cons:  My mouse arm is killing me and I haven't gotten to bed before 2 AM for 2 weeks straight so my real life is suffering a little.  I only wanted to try it and I'm afraid I might be addicted.  I had seen a nerd on youtube that said M15 is good, but to learn the game go back to M14.  And he was right.  I can see that when I return to M15 I will have the card knowlede to build a decent deck of my own.  I just beat the game a few minutes ago and am still pretty pumped.  The game is easy to learn, that's for sure.  But it's easy to underestimate how deep it is.  If you made it this far into my review you obviously are interested and if you have a mind for strategy then pony up the money for a game you can impress other nerds with.  Like the nerds at Mensa who gave the Magic TCG  the ""Mensa Select"" award at the Mensa Mind Game competition in 1994.  I started not even being able recognize a single card.

It looks prettier graphics wise than 2013 but all the same bugs and problems that existed in 2013 simply ported over with the core engine. The cheating has been just as bad as 2013 as the deck hackers were up and running from the start in this edition as they werer in 2012. The Sealed Deck format is nothing of the sort. Sealed Deck in name only. there is no tournament to play (you are restricted to 1 vs 1 games) and there is zero re-playability. You get two slots 6 initial booster packs to open and 3 more are earnable by playing the sealed deck campiagn (for each slot). The card pool is absolutely horrible and repetative. For those of us doing this legitly, making decent decks in Sealed with this pathetic ""Random Pool"" is about impossible. The so-called card randomizer is stuck in white and blue mode. Black and Red are very light and green is so-so in its card draws. You might as well save your money and not bother buying additional slots because after 20 decks now in Sealed I can tell you now they all will look identical. White/Blue with the occassional Black white or Black green,,,,, and always the same cards ... always. In a word .... BORING. Then after running through the Sealed campaign to get more of the same cards you already have, you get to go online to see how well your new deck performs against a human only to meet deck Hacker after deck Hacker who obviously was not pulling HIS cards from the same  random lot you were. I laughed at the obvious hacked decks as I saw clone after clone of the campaign decks (Eldrazi, Avacyn Ajani, Lilianas) almost card for card. yeah ok. Anyone who knows sealed deck in real life and who has made 4 or 5 decks in this game in Sealed KNOWS you will be bowing down worshipping the Magic Gods to see one mythic rare hinge card let alone an entire decks worth of power cards that flawlessly resembles the campaign decks. This is nothing like the 1997 issue Sealed deck format we got from Microprose (Which stomps the crap out of this money grubbing format) where you could make a sealed deck and play in a tournament then do it all over again if you wanted unlimited ...... so this game is ok for 10 bucks but I wouldnt waste any more money on it in the Sealed Play as you will end up with a bunch of Blue/White decks all with the same cards .... very boring.

As well as the 5-6th Kor spiritdancer enchantment decks.  Zendikar and Scars of Mirrodin block cards are heavily featured in this version as well as previous incarnations.  The challenges were extremely boring and to easy to solve, as opposed to the other versions which actually required some thought and tinkering with to figure out.  The highly touted sealed deck feature was disappointing, and continuing for another sealed pool required micro transactions.The good side is more customization, particularly lands, which comes in handy for curving mana better and more handily.  For example, Duels 2013 had a goblin deck which featured cheap and inexpensive goblins, unfortunately far to often a mana flood was in order for the deck,  Nothing quite like having 5 lands on turn 5 played and 3 creatures and an action card.Other good things, an improved artificial intelligence.  Lack of fun and entertaining modes such as Planechase, Archenemy leads to stale gameplay is another bad addition, especially for lack luster sealed play.  At times, all progress on your deck unlocks  often get reset, leading to having to reunlock every card once again, which can be frustrating."

Stemming from this is the crazy DLC packs that they clearly produced in a effort to add more variety to what becomes a very predictable game. One problem......If you like Magic The Gathering enough to buy all the decks packs and expansions for use in the game why wouldn't you just buy the actual real life cards and play with people? You'd have a quality product and ever changing encounters depending on your opponents tactics and card draws!So my conclusion: -Buy and enjoy the game for what it is, especially as of the time of writing this its not that expensive, but stay away from the DLC and consider buying some real decks for a far more varied game."

,Recommended,213850,7917502,"Posted: 4 December, 2013",all,Tom Servo,"So I was actually very hesitent to buy this one, because Magic 2013 felt pretty much the same as 2012 except with a few more decks, some bells and whistles thrown in, and a clunkier interface. But when 2014 went on sale, I gave in and bought it though I had low expectations. I never thought I'd be pleasently surprised by how much it has -actually- improved.Firstly, I simply cannot gush enough about the implementation of the player into the storyline. Before, you just fought all of these planeswalkers without any real reason... you really didn't  have a connection to them whatsoever, you followed -their- storyline without having one of your own. The game is a bit more immersive in that it actually includes you in the storyline. In the first duel you have with Chandra, she speaks to -you-, the player, and the information she gives decides your journey further.The interface has cleaned up a lot: it's more streamlined and much less clunky. The menus are easier to use and cleaner. You can pick the lands you play for multi-colored cards, which is a nice addition. In battle, the phases bar look cleaner as well.Graphics-wise, the cut-scenes were a little off. I preferred the method they've always used in the past: still figures and moving backgrounds. This time, some parts are animated and they look a little sloppy, as if they were created in the 90s. But it's not a huge deal. Some cards are animated, which is a really cool effect.Other than that, you can expect the usual fair: new decks, new avatars, new game modes, etc. I've never felt any of the other games were comparable to the first PC Magic game, but this one I feel is the new standard."

,Recommended,213850,7388449,"Posted: 14 October, 2013",all,Basilius,"For us Planeswalkers, there’s a desire to cast Memory Lapse on our minds and view the game again as beginners. We long for those trampling monsters, the overpriced yet devastating spells, and the bliss that comes from winning a game by bashing your opponents face with a 9/9 dragon. Unfortunately once the maturing mage explores more refined planes—constructed, limited, EDH—he leaves behind the naive yet slightly more satisfying battles of his youth. He trades primordial wreckage for strategy and precision. “Expensive” is now defined in RL currency, rather than mana. The ingenious creations of an adventurous mind are replaced by the fine-tuning of imitation. Suddenly the love of the game is “promoted” to the love of the metagame. And we feel with this evolution that something was lost.Magic 2014 lets us revisit those simpler times. Picking your flavor of magic, whether it’s the rampage of green’s creatures or the scalding of red’s spells, every player can pilot decks attuned to their style and fight the personalities of the Dominarian multiverse. The games are straightforward yet rarely frustrating, and the addition of new cards for every win makes progress enjoyable. The diversity of decks keeps things fresh, and the power of later challengers or revenge campaigns puts your deck to the test. I say deck, because it is your ability to structure your deck that makes the most difference. Games are often too simple to reward strong plays, and unlocks are the only meaningful way to improve your chances of success.For veterans, this makes the game a joke if you know what to look for. For new players, or experienced ones with discipline, this makes exploring the game a joy. Challenges, achievements, personas, and titles all round out the package to burn time and steep yourself in flavor. Probably the best part of the game is multiplayer, where playing a few constructed or sealed games with your mates makes you feel like the (albeit pleasant) grind was worth it. Mercifully, Wizards of the Coast lets you buy decks for a dollar, so those with cash to burn can skip the monotony.Duels of the Planeswalkers, as a series of games, is inferior to both MTGO and the real thing. But for a journey to a more innocent past, where the game is what mattered, not your meta-strategy or budget, these are refreshing and enjoyable. For those who can’t help but unlock the best decks and smash the computer’s face in, this probably isn’t the game for you. If you owned the previous titles, you likely already own this one, but if you’re on the edge I would say it’s my favorite one yet, but not a big enough improvement to justify the buy. But if you do grab it, I also recommend the expansion, which simply adds more magic love.Any platform, short of finding 13 year olds just entering the fray, where I get to swing with giant dragons and drop game-breaking spells for twelve mana, is worth the price tag. It’s Magic at it’s core, unfettered by efficiency and pretension. But it’s certainly not Magic at its best."

If you don't know what that is it can be thought of as the game of chess crossed with poker, painted with a thick coating of fantasy. The main difference between this and real magic card game is that this does not allow you to build your own decks--you are given 10-15 pre-made decks that can be customized with a small (perhaps about 30) pool of unlockable cards you can buy with unlock dlc packs or earned through wins. The game's strength is its low price, ability to play vs decent computer opponents, and flexible multiplayer that includes two-headed giant mode (normally magic is played 1v1, two-headed giant is a 2v2) with or against any combination of computer opponents, friends, or random people.For the price, Magic 2014 offers a very good experience for players new to magic or players (like myself) that haven't kept up with magic in a while. People who are already immersed in magic and play frequently with their own cards will find Magic 2014 to be lacking."

Some are staged up so IMBA that you need to strategize what deck and build you want to bring into; some even takes a few retries.Sealed deck offers some kind of ingenuity gameplay; kinda like my schooling days’ decades ago, where we pay tournament entrance fee which includes Starter and 2 packs of Booster; it’s using your skills with whatever luck that fate had deal you. Sadly, I got trashed so bad on round one that I can’t sleep properly for days; Mirage Starter with 2 packs of Weatherlight Booster. Got good and expensive cards but without deck synergy to perform needed combos. While playing Magic 2014, the Sealed Deck aspects does bring back nostalgic moments. Thankfully, there’s “Restart Duel” option. It’s still challenging.The music tracks are masterfully orchestrated and the animations just nice. Some story cut scenes to make the story mode a little more interesting.There’s still lots of rooms for improvements. But I doubt they will spend resources on working on older releases.

If you're a hardcore veteran who wants access to all cards across all expansions throughout the history of Magic, then this game obviously isn't for you (that's Magic Online). This, however, is a low-cost, level playing field where you're not going to break the bank and still have a feeble deck versus something that's been hand-crafted over the past decade to make you lose on the first turn.There are basically two styles of play in this ... Regular and Sealed.By 'Regular' I mean you have a selection of 10 different decks that you unlock by playing the campaign, and these are only customizable in that you can add or subtract from the 80 or so cards in the deck to tune it to your liking. Unfortunately, even after unlocking the decks there's a bit of a grind to unlock the extra 30 cards in said deck, by winning matches (1 win for 1 card). This can be circumvented by spending a buck to unlock a deck, though you can unlock a deck fully just by grinding an easy mission in the campaign and calling it a day. As a found out a previous title, though, this info doesn't get saved to the steam cloud, so it won't be unlocked on other computers, and if you reinstall you'll lose the deck unless you manually save some .cfg file somewhere.Sealed play allows you to create a deck from 9 random 'booster' packs that gives you a wide assortment of cards across all colors to work with (there is a set pool of ~150 card types that these random cards are drawn from, I think). This can be intimidating to work with, but luckily the game offers semi-helpful 'auto construct' and 'deck strength' tools to help you on the way and offer an appraisal of how good it will perform in the game (based upon what metrics, I know not, but serves its purpose well anyhow). The base game gives you 2 such sealed decks to unlock and play, and you can purchase further deck slots for $2 each, up to I think 15 total. I'm sure it irritates some people that you'd have to pay the extra $2, but TBH it's far cheaper than an actual booster pack of real cards. I've already purchased one and am happy with this decision.The 'campaign' story is shallow and the CGI cutscenes might have been good a decade ago. The in-game music is actually pretty good. They've added some animations to certain cards when you zoom in on them, a nice touch IMO. Play feels a lot more streamlined and polished from previous DotP titles. For some reason, they took out the 'Planeshift' mode in multiplayer (where random environment cards would affect play), which I thought was a fun mode so I was sad to see it go.As before, you can probably expect there to be some sort of expansion down the line adding more decks, and probably some random promo codes to look out for to unlock more cards. As it is, though, I've been having a blast in Sealed play and could recommend the game based on that alone."

The game asks what your familiarity with the game is before you begin, so I don't believe everyone has to go through the hand-holding I requested, too.There are multiple modes in the game, and you can customize the deck you're playing with, but you have to win battles to earn more cards. The auto-deck builder can be helpful, or not. You have to play close attention to the balance it chooses for your deck, but it helps you understand what makes a more powerful deck. Like in real life, each deck requires tweaking. I like that about the game.All in all, I recommend it for some casual fun with the game without committing to buying cards for decks."

,Recommended,213850,21184008,"Posted: 13 February, 2016",all,Xenohaz,"Pros:+The attack animations are kinda cool, although they get repetitive quickly.+Very nice as a way to play MtG with friends over skype/curse/teamspeak/whatever.  On that note, I would say it would be best to get this game if you have friends you know will play it with you.Cons:-UI is clunky, frustrating and occasionally buggy.-Pretty expensive if you want the different decks: I got it during the sale, but if it weren't on sale the price tag(s) would've probably scared me away.-The active community is relatively small, so it can take a while to find a match, especially late at night.-The challenges are painfully easy or absurdly difficult to complete without a guide, and seemingly nothing in between.Final note: I know there are more Cons than Pros on this list, but overall I enjoy this game more often than not.  I would just suggest saving your money and waiting for a sale before buying it."
,Recommended,213850,21149203,"Posted: 12 February, 2016",all,BluntForceLlama,"I have purchased this on XBL and now steam, since I have enjoyed it that much.Solid UI.Competent AI.My only complaint for single player campaign, is that once you unlock the harder ""Revenge"" Campaign the computer always seems to draw EXACTLY what it needs early in the match, so if you fall behind even for 1 turn without pulling something useful, odds are you will lose. At that point, in a game in which you are supposed to be pulling randomly from a shuffled 60 card deck, it no longer feels like you are playing a skill game, but more of a game of luck with you having the disadvantage of being the only one with an uncertain deck order.Sadly that means there is not a lot of depth or huge swings of momentum in the campaign. Most duels play out very similiar, meaning I know by what round I need to have certain cards in play. So instead of taking the initial starting hand you are dealt which may only favorable in a longer game, you are now handicapped because the AI will be starting with a quick strike hand, thus you are nearly forced to redeal until you are able to get a favorable draw. While this does make the game more difficult, I feel it does so unfairly. It's like playing 20 different characters in the campaign, but they ALL want to do a Zerg Rush.Haven't been able to find any multiplayer games to join. Dead online community?I still enjoy it. I still recommend it."

The decks provided for you in this edition are fantastic.  Once all the cards are unlocked you have the ability to use some serious Mythic madness.  The background color is nice and easy on the eyes, which is actually pretty important to me because I have sensitive eyes.  The GUI is the most cleaned up out of all of them and menus are easy to navigate through.If you are looking for which of the DoTP series to get, I would highly suggest you try this one first.For the love of all humanity please do not try DoTP 2015 first.  If you do try DoTP 2015 before any of the others, you will most likely end up in the psych ward."

YESBeing a die hard MTG player for years there are a few things that I have come not to expect from any MTG video game. First, there will never be unlimited access to all the playing cards. Second, there will never be a fully functional tourney enviroment without dumping senseless amounts of money into cards that you will never legitly own. If you take those ideas and erase them from your mind from the start you will see that Magic 2014 Duels of the Planeswalkers is still a good game with great playability. There are a few mechanical errors that I have seen so far but once you learn how the system operates you should be able to anticipate those hick-ups."

This game could not have done a better job of teaching the rules and the gameplay, and it's done in such a smooth way that it feels like it's just part of the game.  For new MtG players, this is absolutely a great tool for learning the game and seeing the different possibilities for decks.As for the gameplay, the user interface and music fit perfectly together.  It's easy to see what's going on, and at no point was I confused about anything that was happening.  For such a complicated card game, they have made it very easy to maneuver the turns in-game.  And because there are so many keywords and card effects, you can zoom in on a card to access explanations for any card text, making this game really friendly to newcomers.  The only downside is the timer - you can pause it, but if you don't pause it at the right time, you screw up your whole turn.  It's a little mistake that keeps happening to me.  Maybe others don't have that issue, but I hate having to redo a match because I accidentally skipped my game-winning play.Multiplayer is alive and well, and single player is extensive and fun, and gives a safe place to play when you just want to experiment.  The AI is very good as well, and often I found myself enjoying watching the computer make some really complicated plays on a level that is far beyond what I typically see in card game AIs.  Sealed deck play gives you a set of packs that you open, and piece together some unholy frankenstein deck out of the garbage cards from the packs, and then you play against some sealed decks made by the AI.  It's the closest thing to true deckbuilding in the game, and it's a shame they limit it to 2 slots without paying to unlock more.In fact, that's actually my biggest complaint - there is no true deckbuilding.  You have several decks, and can unlock more cards to let you customize that deck, but you cannot create your own new deck out of all unlocked cards.  You can pay to unlock all the decks, or grind to get them all if you feel up to the repetition.  There's a lot of stuff you can choose to pay for in this game that is optional, but the expansions are worth it for the added decks.There's a lot of other little things in this game that give it a layer of polish that aren't really worth getting into.  But as someone fairly new to MtG, but experienced with card game video games, this is really well done.  I haven't played any of the other versions of this game for other years, but this one is pretty high on my list of good card games.Bottom Line:Absolutely worth the price"
