Wanting to just play though the game, I built ships how I would like to. But the games restrictions are just too much. Add too much and you get a bad grade, which in turn will hault your game upon any boss because you need better ranks on stages. To get better ranks requires boring and tetidious rearranging and picture perfect accuracy. Upon reaching the last boss, the game wanted me to go back and get 15 more stars before I could beat the game, and that really ruined it for me.Most of the time the game just left me stressed and frustrated. There was only one time where I really felt enjoyment in the game and it's upsetting to say so, because this game looks promising, but it fails to deliever the joy and fun I've had with other indy games of this style.If I could play the game how I want to, this game would be worth it. But with the restrictions and constant remindering to go back and get better ranks at stages you've done before, I'd have to recommend a pass on this one."

Build your own battle bot kind of games like this seem to be a lot of fun until you find out how limited, frustrating, or poorly they realized the ideal.  This one highlights the lack of multiplayer as soon as you get bored with the puzzle aspect.  I have nothing in general against puzzle games, but i hate to see great ideas like this being relegated to -just- another puzzle game.Buy it on a good sale if you really want it, otherwise don't bother."

The tiny bit of novelty in making your own designs wears off early and is quickly replaced with a sense of agonizing boredom as you rebuild your ship from the same base over and over and over for every level. Enemy AI seems target at a random. This is a good game in small doses, maybe 20 - 25 minutes at a time. Wait for a sale though, $9.99 is too much for what you get here. If you see it for 75% off, go for it."
,Not Recommended,214100,1524860,"Posted: 1 May, 2013",all,Ryebread,"This a nice game of constructing your own hob-powered destruction engine, but bear in mind that it is essentially a physics trial&error puzzle game. There are 37 levels in total, and the ships you build are only to specifically fight the enemy(s) of each particular level. Nothing is carried over besides unlockable (over various) parts for your ship.For me, it was interesting at first, but grew tedious as I had to reinvent my ship for every stage, and was left in severe want of a free-form/sandbox stage to build an all-purpose mega-ship or an inpractical behemoth of my own.Once you finish the stage, there is little left to do except to replay old stages to get a higher rating (done by using less materials and guns). It took me 7 hours to finish this game, and while it was an initially fun experiment/distraction, I wouldn't recommend that you pay full price for this."

,Not Recommended,214100,8401862,"Posted: 29 December, 2013",all,Lion Heart,"The idea is good, but the game gets borign fast.You build your vehicle with the intent of destroying the ai controlled rig. You pick parts/build it, and set it to battle...thats all. You can not control the unit afterweards...just sit and wait to see if it won or not, if it did you go to the next round vs another ""harder"" AI oponent...it gets tiresome quite quickly...I would say its a pass unless its on sale for less than a buck."

When you ineviably get stuck you will go on youtube to see how to do it, right?  Not really because there are different outcomes even if you use exactly the same setup over and over you will constantly face more and more problems.  Then you will get annoyed and never play the game again.Overly 'Fairly awful'"

The game has enough variation between levels but it still feels repetitive.  Getting three stars per level is tricky and difficult a couple of levels in. 5.5/10

,Recommended,214100,1895685,"Posted: 16 December, 2012",all,Krazyface,"I had this game on my wishlist for a while and got it in a sale.  Don't bother.  This game is not very well thought-out.  There is no way to control your craft, it runs on autopilot.  There is no way to point the guns; if you put any on the back-end of your craft, they will fire upon your own ship (several missions place enemies behind you).  The game severely limits how many blocks/guns you can have, and rewards using as few as possible.  While this probably encourages good engineering, it just isn't fun.  I hope someone else does this concept better some day, I was really looking forward to it."
