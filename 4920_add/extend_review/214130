The reason why you should not buy this is the following:This game uses not steams licensing model. You need to enter a Serial-Code to unlock it. You get one of them when you buy the game through steam. But as soon do a clean reinstal (for example new OS setup), you have to enter the key again and you get a message saying ""The key is already in use"". I contacted their support three times (with 2-3 weeks between every email) to ask them to reactivate my key. They just ignore you and dont answer. Even when I thread them in the 3rd mail to take legal steps they just ignore you and don't answer.After that I contacted Steam support and asked for a refund, as I obviously paid for a product I can't use now. They just told me I have to contact the Ikarus (author company of aeroflyFS)...To this day I still have this game in my library that I waste 50$ on and cant use it because of their bad customer support.Please do not buy this and do not support such a company!

,Recommended,214130,7789847,"Posted: 27 November, 2013",all,CoolBreeZe,"I always wanted to fly, and I bought aerofly FS a few months before starting real life flying lessons. The idea was to be in a Visual Flight Rules (VFR) airplane and familiarize myself with flying, but skip (unknown) procedural parts. aerofly FS isn’t a full flight simulator like MFSX or X-plane, but to my opinion, it succeeds very well in introducing VFR flying. Flight dynamics are accurate; I spent most in-game time in the Cessna 172 Skyhawk, flying VFR over Switzerland, and landing/taking off at all airstrips. I use real VFR circuit patterns and airspace classification information to add to the experience, and just fly VFR flights from one place to the other. I also do a bit of airwork, e.g. maneuvers (stall recovery, steep turns, slow flight, crosswind landings) and procedures (emergency, circuits), but lack of resistance of joystick/pedals and lack of G-force loadings are not making the experience very close to the real deal. But none of these is the game's fault. In that regard, I miss other AI traffic, radio telephony with ATC, simple procedures (e.g. start the engine, turn on landing lights, VOR navigation), and maybe recording capacities. Few additions are planned, but it is still unclear when and how they will be released. Nevertheless, I love flying & I love aerofly FS. Out."

Fuel mixtures, Air Traffic Control, A.I. aircraft and Autopilot are amongst a handful of things that are simply not present in Aerofly FS. It is very clear that Aerofly is meant to be a VFR simulator, with its comparatively small gameworld, small range of aircraft, and lack of radio communication, and whilst this is ultimately all-right, it may deter more experienced simmers from investing a lot of time into it.Despite lacking in a detailed simulation, however, Aerofly FS has understood and captured the joys of flying and sight-seeing very well. And with its simple control-scheme and variable flight dynamics, its a considerable investment for someone looking to get into the flight-simulation genre."

But boy am I glad I got it (for around US$8 equivalent). This is an excellent game for the money. Yes, it only covers Switzerland, but it does so in stunning detail. There is nothing generic about the scenery and no repeating patterns. Everything is exactly as it is in real life, towns look like towns and appear where they should, rivers and lakes are where they should be. The scenery is breathtaking and you will have to do a lot of flying to see all of it. The aircraft look, feel and sound real and they are fantastic. Yes they don't have alll the intricate details of a study sim, but they do the job just fine. I've come a long way with flight simulators such as FSX, X-Plane, P3D, DCS World, IL-2. You name it, I had it. And this sim is fantastic. I like the moving map which you can pop on or off and the info panel which you can hide or display. I like the way that you set up the controls, it is so much better than FSX, P3D or Xplane. I like the way my TrackIr works with it. I like the challenges (mini-missions) and Dovetail can take some lessons here for their crappy Flight School. I am simply having a ball with this sim and cannot believe how cheap it is. You're getting a whole game with 8 great aircraft, detailed scenery for a whole country, a bunch of missions/challenges, and something like 34 airfields, all for the price of one heavily discounted FSX add-on. Perhaps it is a good thing that I waited this long to get Aerofly FS 1 and for all the problems to be sorted out, because all I can see here is a really cheap, really enjoyable and really good-looking flight sim."

The detail on the aircraft itself is impressive, ranging from seeing the steering components actually move to minimal, but visible, damage on the airplane. Landing and taking off is simplified.The biggest issue I have with Aerofly is the quality of the environment. Clouds are not highly detailed and the ground is very barren. The occasional cluster of buildings you might fly over (or through), are the ""large cities,"" while the rest of the landscape has nothing besides Google Earth-like textures. The mountains are nicely done though.Overall, if you are looking for an easy to pick up, quick to learn flight sim, it's hard to do better than Aerofly FS, but if you are looking for a serious, challenging, realistic flight simulator, look elsewhere, such as MS flight sim. It will entertain you, but not really challenge you."

But first thing you will notice is that nothing really works. Try switching something via your cockpit buttons and you hit a wall because there is no functionality on the buttons.Being only limited to Switzerland is also a very big downside. The world also seems unreal with only sun shining all the time and bright colours. Because the sim is so limited it cannot really compete with X-Plane and FSX. It is only good for soaring. Unless the developers expand the world and give more indepth features for it i dont recommend getting this. You can get quality addons for fsx with the price of this game that give as high level of detail to Switzerland as is presented here and you can use it with much indepth simulator FSX.

The flightmodels are absolutely magnificent a very close replica to the real world equivalents. The default scenery is the best I have ever seen in a flight sim by a large margin especially on the highest of settings. Its a shame that you can only fly within one area and other world locations arent currently present. The number of default aircraft is slightly limited all thoughh it appears there are DLC aircraft available to purchase created by Just Flight (Only 2 at the moment). There is no AI so you are literally flying around by yourself, on a similar note there is currently no multiplayer mode available. That being said I think it is due to be added in the next version/ patch. The weather physics (e.g. Wind) is absolutely brilliant, it feels very much like real life especially through the valleys where there are updrafts and downdrafts & thermals etc, very good. The user interface is easy to use and looks decent. There is good controller detection support as well & the game in general is very easy to setup.As im sure others have posted it's a great starter or casual sim experience.

,Not Recommended,214130,7902827,"Posted: 3 December, 2013",all,elad,"TL;DR: One of the worst flight simulators I've every played.I've been a fan of Flight Simulators ever since I played Microsoft Flight Simulator X back in 2007, and have been playing various simulators ever since.Aerofly looks decent, has neat graphics, and looked promising. I managed to fly (and land) the Cessna quite easily.So what's my problem with this game?I guess my standards are too high. Flight Simulator X had dozens of planes, and allowed me to fly anywhere in the world. aerofly has a much smaller selection of planes and airport, which was disappointing.The fact that you can break various parts of your plane (mostly the wings) when crashing looks visually good, but it usually makes no sense: if I slam on the ground too hard, my wings shouldn't fall off. I'd expect an explosion, or my plane stopping to work, but having my wings fall off and the rest of my plane rolling around makes no sense at all.While we're at the subject of crashing, crashing planes is where the physics engine of this game really shows how bad it is: I don't know if you watched Air Crash Investigation or saw footage from real plane crashes, if you would you would see crashing in this game is nothing like that. when I crash in game, my plane is thrown back into the air upside down, falls again and then the game restarts.The planes in game were too easy to manouver and did not feel right. The controls are extremely senetive and the planes react so quickly as if they are unaffected by gravity, wind or drag. Calling this a simulation is like calling Just Cause 2's flight mechanics a simulation: it's a balant lie.On the subject of simulation, there's no Air Traffic Control, no failure simulation, no ability to start in a parking lot and drive your plane there, no control over most of the detailed plane subsystems (Compared to other simulators which allowed me to turn off the engine, or cut off one of the fuel tanks, enable navigation radios, or set trim...).So my bottom line: not really worth 40$ (and I'm starting to think it wasn't worth the 20$ I paid for it when it was on sale)."

I thought (before purchasing) that this was a true flight sim with an entire World size map to fly in. Nope. And the controls are quite basic and they are not many key functions to customize. I am a bit disappointed with all of the positive reviews of this. I had considered not buying this but I read a few of the nice reviews and thought (why not give it a go). But now after playing it hopefully I can get my money back because I believe those positive reviews to be fake and misleading. Unless you have no idea about flight-sims, STAY AWAY from this one!"
