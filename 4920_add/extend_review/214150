The user interface has a few issues but they are managable.  the biggest downside was figuring out how to play the game which for me meant making the AI very dumb …. well below the beginner level ai for a game, figuring out some core mechanics then notching up the challenge after figuring a few things out."

But I was amazed.Finally a game that can truly match the amazing gameplay and addictiveness of the Sid Meier's: Civilization franchise. Now I regret  not buying the package deal of GC1&GC2, becouse I sure will buy the seqeul and am really looking out for part 3.When your a Civilization junkie like me? You sure should try this game out! You will find yourself finally having something to beat your addiction, just get your self a new one!"

There have been reported problems getting this game to install or run all over the forums, and while I didn't encounter any of the installation problems, even the proposed solutions to getting the game to launch don't work for me.As such this is a thumbs-down, but mostly as a warning that the game may not work at all for you!

The only issue was some of the auto focus changes but was common for the year it was released.  I have not played II or III so I am guessing they learned.  I am about to purchase II in hopes they got rid of the more aggrevating behaviors.  Overall the game is very playable and well woth the $10 I payed for it.
76561198053081900,Recommended,214150,11276250,"Posted: 16 July, 2014",all,Blackfish,"This was one of the few games I played over and over as a teen.I'll be honest, I never got into the sequel, because I didn't like the way the planets were depicted (though it probably made influence more intuitive). So I don't know how this one holds up to GalCiv II. But on its own merits, it's a good game.In Galactic Civilizations, you start out as ruler of united Earth. The various alien races, having gotten the secret of hyperdrive from the humans, have turned off their massive wormhole portals and scrapped them for hyper-capable colony ships. The real space race has begun, and it's up to you to determine the path you want humanity to take.Madcap conquest is definitely an option, but if that either doesn't sound appealing or isn't practical, you can turn to other means - being a technocrat and staying ahead by selling and leaking techs; buddying up to the top dog; making everyone's economies dependant on your trade; or amass cultural influence by convincing the aliens how awesome Hollywood, Nike and Coca-Cola are. In practice, most games tend to involve a combination of all the above - the alien races tend to be more receptive to your diplomacy if you have a lot of ships with big guns, or if a significant chunk of their economy is powered by trade with you. And being ahead in tech is useful for keeping a welfare economy afloat by selling techs to other empires, or to prop up an enemy of an enemy without going to war directly. Conversely, rolling in dough means being able to bribe your rivals, buy state-of-the-art warships from a militarist friend, and ramp up domestic spending (including research and social projects).Along the way, you get to decide whether to be an evil empire, a benevolent federation or any combination and variation of them. A sprawling but sparsely populated expansionist nation, or a handful of highly-developed star systems? Military juggernaut or trade linchpin of the galaxy? Underhand arms dealer or open warmonger? Your answer to these questions is often simply ""yes"". It's telling that a game that allows you to build aphrodisiacs and massive theme parks also give you the option of building propaganda machines and pseudo-Death Stars - often at the same time (who says star-killing not-moons can't have fun water slides?).The alien civilizations all have distinct personalities - by default some are good, some are neutral, some are evil, but fiddle with their alignment setting at the start of the game and they change accordingly - a civilization that originally extended a friendly hand will now threaten to exterminate you at the slightest excuse, and vice versa. They will gloat when they're winning a war, grovel when they're beaten; extort you when they're much more powerful and don't like you, give you periodic gifts with mincing courtesy when you're the powerhouse.Though a thoroughly old game by now, this game has plenty of charm and solid mechanics underpinning them. I'm sure nostalgia only affects my verdict -that is still amazingly fun- only a little."

This is definitely the case where playing through one obsoletes the other, in my opinion... still, the amount of game you get for the 'Ultimate Edition' on Steam sale can't be ignored."

I love 4x genre but CIV is my taste. This game has steep learning curve and no tutorial. You have to learn the game by watching YouTube videos from legendary streamers/LPs. I had no nostalgic touch for this game too. Also I couldn't stand so old graphics. I know graphics is not everything, but I seriously couldn't stand this very old graphics.The game is good as per many reviews. But if your gaming taste and/or profile matches similar to me, then stay away from this. Get newer 4x space strategy games, plenty of good games available in the market.Note:  I played the game (at least tried) for 2 hours, however Steam couldn't capture the game time somehow."

I have looked up this problem on forums and the only soution is to turn off any battle animations, which ruins the games excitment a little.

I was expecting something more like a SRPG with a science-fiction setting... I didn't realize that the focus of the gameplay was closer to Civilization than a turn based ""Homeworld"" (focusing on spaceship combat).  Besides a handful of scenario missions there doesn't seem to be much to play besides setting up stand alone games.There's plenty of playable alien races and a couple different classes of ships, but I found the interface and gameplay to be hard to comprehend, and no real tutorial to teach you during play for people that don't want to read the manual."
