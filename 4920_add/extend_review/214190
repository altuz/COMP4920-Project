However, the developers have been taking steps to bring back the servers. Althought the game is simplistic in some areas and could be greatly improved, the progress made on it since early access cannot be neglected. I recommend this game to anyone who seems a bit interested (as soon as functionality is restored) because it truly is a great game to play with friends.Many thanks and best wishes to the developers."
,Not Recommended,214190,34068095,Posted: 6 August,all,Bitl,"Was a very fun and interesting title. However due to its lack of a playerbase and servers, I reccomend holding back on this one.If you really want to play it and get somewhat of a playable experience, you can host a single player server like this:1. Go to your Steam directory.2. Go to steamapps/Minimum/Binaries.3. Open MinimumLauncher.exe and make sure ""Bots Allowed"" is checked and set ""Server Type"" to ""Lan"". After that, select ""Start Server"". Feel free to mess around with the options as you please.4. Wait for the server to fully start up.5. Then, launch the game or open it if you have already launched it.6. Select the game mode you have selected from when you created the server and then click on ""LAN"".7. In the ""IP"" section, type in ""localhost"" or ""127.0.0.1"" as the IP, then click connect.8. If you are at a loading screen, congrats! You just hosted a server!Hopefully someone big in the gaming community will revive this and make it have a bigger playerbase, but for now, hold off on it unless you are extremely interested in the title."

Even if it gets picked up again you just know there is something going to be wrong with it.'Yes an incredibally stunning 3rd person shooter game with MOBA elements added, just dropped by both publisher and developer in a most appalling fashion. Regardless of it once having thousands of players a week, today you would be extremely lucky to find 50 a week. What happened? Why did it suffer a sudden catastrophe?Well for one thing the developer/publisher decided to delete premium content that customers had paid good money for when they made a complete overhaul of the game in one of their updates. Its not a question of wether the publisher had a right to do this as any careful scrutiny of small print will show when it comes to microtransactions that the publisher ALWAYS hold the right to the stuff that you buy. Instead it's more the question was this a wise move on the account of the publisher/developer? And lets just say that the mass exodus from the game has already answered such a question.The problem is, in my experience, no constant nagging or complaining will ever, ever, ever bring that premium content back to you. Yes you might as well just accept the fact that you are a victim to that small print you earlier ignored. However in reality, gamers never, ever accept this fact and before you know it you have a negative tsunami of bad reviews completely devastating any chance of new ones coming to enjoy the new product for what it is. This negative feedback has seriously taken it's toll on the game and as of now, there are not even any servers being maintained by either publisher or developer. Instead the request has been made that the consumers themselves start to host their own servers for the game so that the hardcore fans of the game can continue to enjoy its content and at the same time save costs for both publisher and developer.Because of this newly introduced strategy you will hardly ever find a server to join and if you do it will most likely be team death match meaning that the principle other two modes of gameplay are completely ignored and you will hardly ever get to experience it.First there is Titan mode: Each team has a titan (a massive transformer robot) whose objective is to destroy your enemies walls in order to gain access to their nemesis power plant and destroy it. You can level up your titan by harvesting creeps which are spider like things that crawl along the ground. This mode often required good team strategy and some real challenging head to head combat. Now unfortunately this mode is but an elusive dream.Horde Mode: 4 players are stacked up against progressively tougher wave spawns of enemies. Only expert players were ever lucky enough to go the hard yards in this mode. This mode required a professional approach all the way.Team Death match: Its the only mode you will most likely still occassionally find. More often than not you will be pitted against bots and the occassional pro that just can't let the game go. Problem is the pro will be ruthless and you stand very little chance being anything other than fodder. This mode is still enjoyable if you can play it with friends and it is easy to farm bots with and level up quickly so you can unlock the large assortment of guns that the game does have and which is completely free, no microtransaction needed.Personally this game is practically dead, the only chance of revival is if they were to make it free, but this would off course bring the microtransactions back which everyone hates. Maybe they can make it free for several weekends every year and hopefully spark some interest back into it? Maybe some communication from the publishers and developers and a formal apology will go a long way? Maybe its worth an earnest effort to see if that they can again get some dedicated 24 hr servers running for the game? What are the chances of this game making a comeback and not entering into an early grave? Poetically I think it's chances are quite 'minimum'.Here are the developers:http://humanhead.com/Here are the publishers:https://www.atari.com/Here are various you tube videos i like showing you the different modes...Titan:https://youtu.be/fyqI9fcVNmI( at the 7 minute mark in video he shows titan mode)Death match:https://youtu.be/C48TdFA7L8UHorde:https://youtu.be/40Qjk_yQMBU"

Just thought I'd put this out there for those considering.Now, I've seen a couple bugs. If you're pressing/holding a directional key when a match is starting, your character can sometimes get stuck moving in that direction. I'm talking about with the keyboard here, so I imagine the same issue might be present on a controller (a positive that it's so easy to set one up if you wish).The only other problem I've seen is a number of one-sided matches, whether I'm on the winning side or not. This can almost entirely be attributed to how new the game is, however. Everybody will figure it out given some time. FYI the ability to run and gun outweighs the benefits of swords at least in the early/mid game.Despite minor stuff as above, this game feels like a good shooter, and it feels like a very polished game considering how small the dev team must be. It's graphics are simplistic (or minimalistic, as the title plays on), but still very pleasant to look at, especially when maxed out.There's plenty of depth and longevity to the crafting system and progressive power curve in each match. When it comes right down to it, what any MOBA or MOBA-lite needs is solid combat, and this game delivers.GIGANTIC looks like a great game as well, but to some extent, it feels like Minimum has already accomplished what that game intends to do.Great job devs. Anxiously awaiting future updates as this game hopefully continues to grow."
,Recommended,214190,14771229,"Posted: 6 March, 2015",all,PWNomancer,"So I bought this game on sale, and it looked really good, but I couldnt play it because my computor was a♥♥♥♥♥♥ but now, on my new computor, It works fine. This game is really fun, Like, REALLY FUN. I'd say that it's a lot more fun than even Space marine was for me, and as an avid fan of warhammer 40k, That means something.There are a few balance issues though. For starters, jumping backwards is the same speed as running forwards, so you know, Melee is really easy to counter. Speaking of that, Almost everything you come across is a counter for melee.Shotguns, Miniguns, Sniper rifles, Launchers, EVEN SOME GRENADES WHIPE THE FLOOR WITH YOU. Now, I'm not saying melee is impossible, quite the opposite, It's really fun. Personally i'm a fan of the Heal katana, but i dont see it often. It's just kind of annoying when you get someone with a freeze gun so that you cant move, a fire grenade so you cant heal, and a shotgun to sit right infront of you, but just out of range. Speaking of that, I cant figure out which one, But one of the shotguns seems really freaking broken. In three games, this same guy was wielding it, and it ended up deciding the fate of all three games. I mean what the ♥♥♥♥? It has a set spread and high damage and fire rate. Who thought that was a good idea? It doesnt even have a slow reload speed or anything. Once it starts rolling, it doesnt stop, unless you snipe him down, which you cant do because there's freaking terrain literally everywhere.Other than that, the gameplay really is quite fun. The main gamemode is titan mode, where, when the game starts, you have enough for one peice of armor, and both teams have a titan. Both titans are invulnerable untill they start to fight.Pretty much at this point you have two choices, Help destroy theirs, or use excessive force to stop them from destroying yours. After either dies, the other goes on to try break two walls, There are turrets that assist you at this point, but the enemies can destroy those. After either has destroyed both walls, they have to break the enemies power core with four hits. When both die, a new phase begins called the creep round, in which you go around killing some creeps for recources for armor and to power up your titan. There are also golden ones, which are really fast and hard to kill with melee (Rip), Which, as you can guess, gives better recourses and boosts your titan even more. As you kill enemies, your currently equipped weapon levels up up to 5 times. When you die, it resets. I'm not sure how the reset is calculated, but i often end up with level 2-3 out of spawning, which is wierd. So armor has three levels and doesnt reset. Armor has really nice bonuses, For instance, i use a centurian armor set, which gives bonuses to yourself and nearby teammates, like movementspeed damage and healing bonuses. it also raises your health by a bunch. All in all, I reccomend this game. it's really fun, but not without it's kinks. I'd say about a 7.5/10."

However this game is still being built, THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS THAT NEED TO BE FIXED. There's also a lot of cool features that we don't have access to yet, with the promise of ""Coming Soon"" (such as being able to level up your gun) Even with the bare game I still love the look and the play of the game. For some reason I like the simplicity of shape based maps and players! (it still looks awesome and I feel it's easier to run on my rig)The game modes are really cool (Team Deathmatch, Titan, and Horde, a survival Co-op type game mode against enemies/dinos) My favorite being ""Titan"" where you must get your Titan to the other side of the map whilist enemies trying to stop yours and progress theirs. If the Titans are destroyed you must battle it out for materials which come from ""Crystal Spiders"" or ""Creeps"" a bug like creature that just runs around spawn areas, in order to get your titan up and moving again. There's also a golden creep that gives your titan 10 points of power. The power is how strong your titan hits the other? or how much damage it can take? All I know is that the more points that your titan has, the better. The gamemode's very fast paced and the matches last a fairly long time if the teams are even, around 30 mins max. Even though the match lasts so long, I never find myself getting board due to the amount of things/objectives to focus on during the match. If everything is pulled off correctly your team will achieve victory through your titan smashing the enemie's core crystal.The weapons are amazing, you can either run around like a ninja or rain down on enemies with your machine gun. Other weapons include, snipers, mini guns, machine guns, shotguns, light sabers, and much more crazy stuff to come. However if you want some extra awesome stuff you've gotta pay for it, and it's quite expensive. You can buy either cool special looking weapons or armour each with their own interesting effects and attributes (for example, a green light saber with the ablility to heal yourself and others around you).I feel they need to balance the sword more though because of how fast people can get near you and slice you in half(There are amours and Techniques to contradict this!) Each time you get a kill you can pick up a crystal that will upgrade your weapon (you can also get these crystals from friendly/enemies destroyed sentrys) and if you get more than a few crystals then you're maxed out and it makes your gun freaking godlike. It makes other players have to team up against you in order to kill you which is a cool addition to teamwork within gamemodes. Aside from working with your team to get rid of pesky enemies, you can run and jump quite smoothly in game allowing you to avoid gun fire and secure the kill. Last but not least I'd like to say a tad about armour and equipment. Armour can be bought throught the match with materials collected, different armour gives you different abilitys and new armour can be bought with points from playing matches. You may upgrade each peice of armour the same as weapons except armour upgrades don't go away when you die and you may only upgrade armour 3 times to max them out. Equipment can also help a bunch wheather it be a well placed gernade or sentry. You may unlock more equipment simply by unlocking and crafting with aquired points from matches.I've had a decent amount of server difficulties. Sometimes I'll play a whole match and get a good amount of kills and then at the end it'll say ""You've been disconnected"" or something as the match score board is up which is really frustrating to a guy that likes to stack up his kills and wins. It'll also kick me sometimes at random times in the match saying ""Lost connection to host"". Another bummer is that I don't get any xp when this happens so no leveling up.... I don't know if this is happening to anyone else though. It hasn't happened to me to many times but due to the fact that it has happened leaves me cringing towards the end of each match.I think that anyone whos got a few bucks should try this game out either now while you've got it half off, or later when there's more features and updates to play off of!I really enjoy this game. It seems like so far you're either going to fall in love with it or completely hate every thing about it. Might aswell give it a try while it's on sale."

The swords (every single one of them) will take a maximum of 3 hits to kill. Combine that with the Knight Armor which increases health by a mind boggling amount, and you're unstoppable. The game itself is fun if you can find a group who are around your level. I don't leave the game a thumbs down because of unbalancing though. My issue with the game at the moment is the way it works. During the tutorial, it says you're invincible during spawn. Nope. Players will idle in your spawn (which there is no penalty for) and spawn kill you with the 1 hit kill level 5 plasma cannon, over and over again. If they're not spawn killing, they're glitching, boosting, or lagging. This game struck me as a masterpiece during development (the earlier stages) but now it is so loaded with trash talking 12 year olds and spawn killing scrubs with +200% health and a 1 shot weapon, that it is unplayable.

Minimum on the other hand has changed me from a Steam plebeian into a Steam reviewing sensei.Game just left early access and still has more content than COD.Updated: 4/9/15I haven't had this much fun with a multiplayer shooter since Badcompany 2. I was real skeptical at first with it just leaving early access. I've had my share of disappointments with early access games and betas on Steam (shakes fist at Starbound) But I'm glad I made that leap head first into Minimum.Titan Mode: I get most of my enjoyment from this mode. The smaller maps never leave you with a dull match. This mode is heavily team based, if you're 10x better than the other team but don't work together to kill creeps you're going to have a bad time.Horde mode:  It's come a long way and is a lot of fun. Not a whole lot of people play is sadly, probably because you can spend 40+ mins playing and the amount of currency squares you gain are minimum. ""10/10 pun"" but seriously one 13min game of Titan Mode will net you more than a 40min Horde Mode game.The crafting system is pretty fun, not too in depth but fun non the least. Each match you start off with enough to make one piece of armor and from there kill creeps and players to build more. Each piece has its own unique set of traits and leveling your armor up is pretty crucial to winning.There are armor pieces you can buy with real money but are just cosmetic and are in no way a (pay to win) cash grab.All in all for $9.99 this is a great 3rd person shooter with unique gameplay you wont find anywhere else."

My impression, from watching the videos, reading the store page, and looking at screenshots, was that it was somewhat Monday Night Combat-like, with both sides having creeps fighting alongside them, and players defeating the creeps as well as enemy players to power up both themselves and their team's titan, with the objective of ultimately pushing their titan into the enemy's base to win.This is not the case.Instead, it's team deathmatch, even down to the small, cramped maps, where little dispensers along the sides spit out ""creeps,"" tiny cube-shaped robots that do absolutely nothing but arbitrarily wander around. These spawn whenever titans are inactive, and you kill them for ""titan powerups"" to improve your titan, which is never quite explained in any depth. ""It makes it stronger,"" is about as detailed a description as you'll get. Once you collect enough, the titans spawn, and meet in the middle of the map to fight. The winner keeps moving and tries to break walls down until it is destroyed. This goes on, ad infinitum, until both walls on one side are destroyed, or you get frustrated and quit because the match has been going on for half an hour.Possibly the most egregious offense, however, was having to create an account and log into a third party service upon starting the game, and then to be greeted with a cash shop on the main menu.Also worth noting is that the game is extremely unstable. Matchmaking frequently does not work, inviting friends to parties can return a number of bizarre and unclear error messages, or leave you in an empty party that doesn't even display yourself as a member, and having the Steam overlay open (especially during loading screens) can cause crashes to desktop and graphical artifacts. Often these errors can only be resolved by completely exiting the game and restarting it. Even the tutorial glitches out if you try to use the menu, forcing you to quit the game rather than being able to return to the tutorial or do anything else.Currently there are very few maps, even fewer weapons, and tremendous balance issues, which I won't even go into, as they're covered extensively by the other Steam reviews. I would really not recommend purchasing this."

Although, ever since it was released, the developers, in my perspective, struggle strongly on performance for others who do not meet all the requirements than is what originally stated on Minimum's Steam page. I strongly recommend the developers to focus on overall framerate, and performance to allow as many users as humanly possible. So, I can finally see the overall reviews go from Mixed, to Mostly Positive.I see Minimum still as an Early Access game that needs tons of work and developers that can read the disliked reviews and create a solution. I hate to see the users pay for a game that can't run properly and stays offline for who ever knows how long. I don't recommend this game to anyone that has a home desktop or any PC unless that PC or desktop is made specially for gaming. I'm curious to see how many users find this review helpful or not."

And to be honest, my opinion still stands.At this point? Save your money. Trust me. - My inital thought.When I wrote this down and made it public for you to see, this was during the Second Beta Weekend that they had where people could get a code and activate it on steam, and I obviously took part in this.When I first played Minimum, I instantly liked the visuals that they had to offer. The simplistic design is something you will either love or hate. I personally love them, but with the lack of detail it would be understanding why you would not like the visuals.Now when I first started to play Minimum, I did not know what to think. The game just throws you in without no explanation what so ever, which could be a problem for many new players coming into the game. Without you looking up or knowing ahead of time you would have no clue on what the armor does, or may not even know that it exists! A huge downfall.Balancing is also a major problem. As you get kills with your chosen weapon, they level up becoming more powerful and more unique. The problem with this is that one or two people on the enemy team can kill you in one shot while you try to kill them with a whole clip. A huge problem.At this point, there is only one game mode, that being Titan. Titan being a Team DeathMatch which has an emphasis on killing an enemy titan to get your titan to move up and destroy There titan factory. (Or whatever its called.) You can also power up your titan by killing creep which spawn when both titans are destroyed, adding a MOBA element to a 3rd person shooter, which is quite unique in itself. But that being the only game mode, it can get quite boring really fast.At this point, I still say do not buy this game unless you like the concept. However, I would still say that you wait for new game modes, new guns and new blueprints to be added to the game."

,Not Recommended,214190,12401170,"Posted: 7 October, 2014",all,il Duderoni,"It's not ready yet. That's the overwhelming feeling that I'm getting with this. Why did it leave Early Access when the game clearly suffers from serious issues, both optimization and balancing wise?Let's start with the optimization. I don't know why, but the main menu with the announcements gets very laggy, while the other options that seemingly show more of the 3D world give me a smooth framerate. Which wouldn't be as annoying, if it wasn't the page that everything defaulted to. Especially when changing servers, you'll just get punted back to that laggy main menu. Which, by the way, lags everything else as well. Don't try and pick another server in Steam Overlay when that's going on.And then there's Titan mode. A mode with obvious influences, not in the least with Moba influences where there are creeps to farm that power up your Titan. For people who start out, it can actually get very fun. Everyone's new and barely knows what to do, which means it usually turns into a straight up bout between forces.But as I level, I seem to encounter more higher levelled people. And they seem to be wielding a nasty little baseraping tactic. One or two of them with maximum levelled weaponry, shells down the opposing team's spawn point while the others farm the Creeps, attack your Titan or escort their own.But you may say, aren't there safezones that we spawn in? Yes, but more often than not, the baseraping happens just outside of there, at points where the team stil gets funneled. Whether or not they're doing it in sight of the Spawn cubicles is irrelevant, really. Even if you try to snipe them, your unlevelled weapon (your weapons delevel upon death) can't hit them hard enough before they can retreat just a little bit and continue what they are doing.In short words: Baseraping is the name of the game, and if you're on the receiving end, prepare to get frustrated.Horde Mode seems fine, but the difficulty ramps up rediculously fast from wave 4 on. Enemies taking shots from the strongest of weapons straight to the face and still perfectly surviving. That's getting a little rediculous. And with a recent patch that apparently nerfs the rewards for these, I'm not sure I want to play these anymore either.Which leaves Team Deathmatch. It's actually one of the better modes to start playing, and seems exploited the least. When more than three combatants meet, it all tends to get pretty chaotic and it seems moderately fun.But even that gets soured when you realize that staying in a server is 9 out of 10 times absolutely not a good idea. A bunch of people leave the server as soon as a match is over, and you're stuck for a long while waiting on random people's mercy to join your game. Games will not start until most or all slots are filled (I've yet to actually see a game start where the final holes didn't get filled) I myself got so sick of it, I too started server hopping soon enough. It's the only way to consistently play and also get some rewards.But if these holes don't get filled during a match... well, you're♥♥♥♥♥♥out of luck then. You can really feel it what team gets the advantage when someone disconnects and nobody fills the gap. In fact, I left a match for that reason, accidentally came back later and saw that autobalance was not a thing. Indeed, 3 v 5 is something that does not get resolved during a match.Rewards are always three types of resources, used to craf weaponry or pay to make specific sets of armor available. Functionality wise, they seem fine, but the menu interface of them isn't optimal either. I was clicking on a weapons picture  (not the equip button) and was hoping to receive some interesting information regarding the weapon in question. Not so, most of the time. A semi blank and obviously unfinished window greets me. If I actually want to learn more about a weapon, I need to go to the crafting menu for it and spot it there.Some hard statistics would be nice, too. What's the rate of fire? How many bullets are there in a clip? Information like that can only be learned by crafting the weapon and taking it for a spin. Yes, that does mean you end up risking creating a weapon you may end up disliking solely because you weren't properly informed.These are all complaints that would possibly get a pass or can be ignored if it was in Beta or ""Early Access"".I don't know, maybe the Minimum devs wanted to force some trust on us by scooting out of Early Access early on, making us think the product is totally worth your time on that basis. That's a wild assumption, but what isn't is that this game is unfinished.Get on that.Once these things are addressed, I'll look into writing a new review that will properly portray the potential fun this game could provide... when finished."

The game used to be owned by Atari, if I am not mistaken, and Atari decided to stop funding it. Suddenly a few people start giving it a thumbs down saying that the game is dead and it wont come back. Yet the developers found another company willing to help fund it, and now the game is back up and running, the problem being that when most of it's previous players found out that the game ""shut down"" they didn't bother checking if it came back.i'll be honest giving a game thumbs down or saying it is bad because it has a low player base is wrong, the devs didn't implement that into their game, it should simply be a warning sing. Now the question is, is it good?♥♥♥♥ YEAH IT'S GOODThe game allows the player to literally play their way, by allowing them to customize their loadouts with multiple guns and swords to choose, and armor sets with different stats and models. It has a quake feeling to it because of the crazy gun play, but third person. The concept for the game is creative and pretty original for one game mode, that being Titan Mode which is the most played, you have to kill these creeps and collect titan power up to make your titan more powerful, players will fight for the creeps, specially the golden creep which gives the titan a power up.  the other 2 game modes are survival (Horde) and Team Deathmatch. The game does have a lot a space for skill gameplay, it may seem sometimes very casual, but when you play the game you realize it requires more skill than it seems.The only bad thing about this game is that it feels oddly optimized, when I'm in the menu it drops to 10 Fps but in game I have 30 Fps, thing is that I have ran heavier games and they run at 40-60 fps. Crashed very little time and the game has never gotten stuck on me. Other than that the game is fine."

It's just like this game claims to be.It blends MOBA and arena shooter concepts in a way that feels seamless, resulting in a fast-paced, highly tactical, and strategically demanding gameplay environment that will leave you with the itch to hunt down any blockman, block-creature, and block-giant in your path.Weapon balance is pretty decent for the most part, although a few improvements can be made throughout this Early Access period.  The main balance complain seems to be over the katanas, but as of now, there have been plenty of counters and a variety of loadouts that have been able to take on katana users no sweat.  The simplest solution is to backpedal and shoot.  You can also craft armors that give you melee defense, higher speed, or higher jump to easily avoid katana users.  As for ambushes? Well, that's kinda what they are good at, so watch your back!As you should expect from Early Access, the content isn't exactly vast and it has its fair share of bugs, but these are highly likely to be improved upon by the time the full release comes since Human Head Studios has proven itself to be making much progress and be highly community-involved.If you like games like Unreal Tournament, Loadout, and LoL, then this game is for you.

Each team has this giant AI player attempting to reach the other side and players battle it out and help their titan while under fire from the enemy to get to the opposing teams destruction point. The game is quite simple, the more you kill the better your weapon becomes. Some mention that it is sort of unfair or unbalanced how the game is with this upgrades (armor upgrade you are allowed to keep throughout the match unlike gun/damage upgrades). I do like this game because you can JUMP and DODGE and SPRINT! You are also able to throw grenades which is always a bonus. There are different weapons from assault rifles to sniper rifles.Visually the game is nice and because of it's minimalistic approach, and the graphics aren't bad. My computer goes nuts though and fans start running like crazy.This game is cool, and because of Titan mode it sort of stands out from the rest of the FPS's out there. I would put this more with competition against Team Fortress 2 rather than a game like Titanfall or CoD. Nevertheless the game is fun but some may find it boring quicker than others.The game was well done, but could have stepped out of it's comfort zone from being another FPS.

,Recommended,214190,12176899,"Posted: 21 September, 2014",all,Ez pz kill me pleasy,"Never thought guys who created Aliens: Colonial Marines would come up with this.So, Minimum is a 'Just-came-out-of-early-access minimalistic 3rd person shooter with MOBA elements'. But that description is wrong about what it says: The game is not complete nor really minimalistic. Apparently, it's version 0.5something, and even though the armor system, base gameplay, weapon crafting and devices are generally done, it features only a couple maps, and the planned weapon upgrade system, structures and all the options that brings into the game aren't available yet. It also has a load of bugs, mainly in the UI and drop system, alongside with some sttutering during loading screens and occasional fails to end the program. It doesn't affect the main gameplay too much, though.The second lie is 'minimalistic'. That's not what minimalistic really means. Sure, it doesn't have stupid drawings on the walls, nothing is lying on the ground, but the models are just blocky rather than being simple. Funnily enough, that gives the graphics an interesting charm - the blocky Titans, one color ground and upgrades that look like small futuristic car batteries go very well with all the lens flare everywhere.The game itself then has three gamemodes: Team Deathmatch, Survival and Titan Mode. But right now I feel the game has actually only one gamemode truly worth playing - Titan Mode. In this particular one, five players on each side are pinned down in a conflict on a simple map featuring one main 'lane' and one or two 'Jungle areas', much like a MOBA would. The 'lane' is where giant robots named ""Titans"" march trough - meeting in the middle to fight to the death, where the winner may continue on to destroy the enemy's base. Bases are then made out of several parts - Power core, which is what the enemy needs to destroy to win, Turrets, which are your best hope to damage the enemy Titan after it destroyed yours, Spawn Rooms, whch are exactly what they sound like, and defensive walls, an equivalent of MOBA towers, which can be damaged only by Titans, and that usually combo with Turrets to keep the Titans under as much fire as possible. Titans, however, don't fight alone - players can help damage the enemy titan and destroy turrets, while the enemy team must be stopped from doing the same.But then, the time comes - both Titans down. Then, the Creep Phase begins. The teams are informed that harmless creeps start spawning in pre-designated areas in the 'Jungle' map parts, where each killed creep drops a powerup that increases your Titan's strengh, making it more probable that it'll win the fight with the enemy titan. Of course, the enemy will do the same - so part of your team should start farming, when the other one should go interrupt the enemy's farming process to cripple them. Alongside with that there is the Golden Creep - faster version of the standart creep with more HP and no restrictions on it's position on the map - wandering around before it gets killed and drops a powerup worth ten times as much as a normal creep's. When time for this phase is up, titans respawn with their newfound strenght and the Titan phase begins once again. Rinse and repeat until the match time is up or one of the sides wins.The PvP combat is based around weapons and armor. You can carry two weapons, one of which may be a meelee, one rechargable device, currently limited to several variants of grenades and turrets, and up to three different pieces of armor: Helmet, Chest armor and Leg armor. Each of these armor parts is crafted on the battlefield from armor shards and polygons (see the pun?), and can be upgraded up to level three. These resources drop every time a Titan is destroyed, a Creep is killed, a wall is broken or a player is killed. Each armor upgrade adds a small HP bonus, and also some kind of a special bonus, which in some cases comes with a disadvantage to keep things balanced. These armors come in sets - each with three individual parts, to provide a bonus to a specific playstyle, but you can mix different armor parts to match your personal one. These stay on you even after you die.Weapon upgrades, however, don't. Every time a turret is destroyed or a titan is destroyed, one blue weapon upgrade is dropped, which you or one of your allies may pick up to upgrade their current weapon by one level. Players, however, drop one upgrade if they don't have a weapon with level three or higher, and drop two of these if they do. Each upgrade increases damage and, beyond a certain differing point, adds the weapon a passive ability. Kills become necessary to have an advantage over your enemy, but with each level over them, the probability of you being focused down because you'll drop twice as much upgrades plus lose all your upgrades increases. This makes the action more dynamic, as you become more and more dangerous the longer you stay alive. Every weapon also features an rechargable active ability - dash, jump, burst fire or super powered projectile.Over all, I think this game is an idea that got ahead of it's age, but the game is still too uncomplete to be fully judged. Just look at the structure plans - there is one that would spawn weak combat creeps all around to slow down the enemy. I can still recommend it though - as long as you can take the bugs and the darn stupid camera most 3rd person shooters share."

,Not Recommended,214190,11416358,"Posted: 26 July, 2014",all,P3TC0CK,"This review is a post-release review. Scroll down for my views during the EAC.Having returned to the game and given it a few more tries after it came out of Early Access I can definitely say I would not recommend this game as a purchase at the current moment.As mentioned in my EAC review, this game has a whole lot of potential, but that alone is not enough to warrant paying for this game.Balance issues still exist. Devs and 'regulars' of the community continue to insist that weapons like the Giantkiller and other sword varients are easily counterable. The problem is their view of their own game is pretty short sighted.The devs view so far concerning items/balance has been their damage outputs and offensive capabilities of armor and weapons. While that's needed, Minimum is one of those games where any slight change to your potential movement translate to HUGE advantages in combat.Items like Icarus Pants, swords, shotguns, and berserker pants all have the ability to completely spiral a game out of control.On top of balance issues, my main concern has been that most of the items are hidden behind a grind system. Bought the autosniper because you thought it was cool but it turned out to be severly lacking in damage? Guess you're stick with it until you unlock it after grinding your next level.There are interesting cosmetic items available to buy (which are a way of unlocking some weapons without leveling) but it feels like just an attempt at squeezing the last few dollars out of the last few dedicated groups of players.The devs have spoken regarding this, and they're actually considering making items tradeable/sellable in the market and plan to give them unique modifiers. If that doesn't give you a hint of ""pay to win"" then I don't what will besides having to straight up buy each weapon.I initially bought this game in hopes of supporting a great idea from a great dev in the hope the dev would learn from their mistakes. I made this decision even with the knowledge that they were planning to add cash shops and weapon unlocks.Seeing how the game is developing, with half-baked changes and silly cash grabs instead of real content and consumer-friendly updates, I unfortunately cannot recommend this game to anyone.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Does Minimum have potential? Yes. Is it worth buying at this point? Absolutely not.I was initially on edge about buying this game (especially early access, which I've decided not to do anymore) but seeing that Human Head Studios, the creators of the Rune series, was making it I decided to make the jump and support them.The game is pretty unbalanced, but this can be forgiven as it is early access and it seems the devs are pretty active at updating the game. The art style is hit or miss, personally I love it but I am sure a lot of people will not like it.The game has a lot of potential, but other than that it's filled with a lot of balance issues.The biggest issue in my opinion is you need to play many games to farm resources and unlock schematics. This wouldn't be an issue if it were for cosmetic items, but to place all weapons, armor, and items under this catagory is a problem. The idea of crafting your items on the fly is a great one, and opens up a lot of posibilities and variation as every item significantly affects your character's abilities and sometimes even your allies.To force players to grind out those items puts you at a pretty clear disadvantage if you don't have the time to do so or you buy items that are not currently in the meta.This isn't a free to play game (hell even F2P games like Dota 2 don't do this kind of thing) and shouldn't be treated as such. Until the system is changed, I can't recommend this game to anyone who takes competition seriously."

,Recommended,214190,14206706,"Posted: 28 January, 2015",all,KoJeT_,I'm actually very mixed about this game.  It has a classic arena shooter to it almost akin to Quake or unreal with moba esc aspects in the titan gamemode.  Your weapons level up as you kill enemies and pick.. well whatever it is they drop when you kill them.  This isnt for the entire match just until you die. Though some times it seems to retain 1 or 2 of its level ups (weapons max level is 5)  Im not sure what Causes that.  Most weapons seem relativly balanced and easy to deal with if you know how.  I enjoy most of that It makes for a rather solid game.  Its aesthetic choice though not my personal favorite is appealing and simplistic.  The connectivity... was iffy at best.  Some matchs I noticed almost no lag.  Others I couldn't even hit someone At point blank range Because they were NEVER where My client showed them to be this is a huuuge problem and killed a lot of my enjoyment on it.  The game claims to have a crafting system though really its more of a Mid match shop than a crafting system.  The out of game crafting system is again... Basically 2 shops you have to go through to aquire a single weapon.  Which is really annoying.  Yes I do Recommend this game even with my small amount of time playing it though Im not sure how much enjoyment you can really squeeze out of it. I purchased the game while it was $2.50 instead of the regular $10  So I would recommend it for that price.  For the full price I am unsure.also the game is not Early access Though it feels like it is.  Fairly few weapons and gadgets makes most engagments feel the same Even the different Variants of swords and shotguns are almost the same weapon save for the special which... well Makes no difference in my opinion.  If the devs add more weapons and gadgets and maybe some more variety with characters themselves It would be worth its full price.So for what I paid I enjoyed it for its full price Not so much$2.50 7/10 would recommend$10 4/10 Not with current content.

However, I'm not sure this is a purchase worthy of your time. This game recently came out of Early Access but it still might need a little more time in the oven. The core shooting mechanics are solid, but the supporting features are disappointing. The ""crafting"" system is really just a specialized currency system that you use to purchase new equipment. Don't expect very much customization here. I couldn't even figure out how to change colors. The deathmatch and co-op survival modes are what they sound like, but the core ""titan"" mode is confusing. Your goal is to protect your titan while trying to destroy your opponents and their titan, but the strategy pretty much always boils down to a free-for-all. I was getting waxed over and over again. With no real class system beyond your weapon loadout, player direction is really lacking. I was just running around most of the time hoping for a kill and would suddenly find myself sliced in half by a high level player with a lightsaber katana. Whatever...the game is really cool looking and it's got lots of nice weapon effects. I really, really REALLY want to like this game, but I have doubts that there will be a player base willing to stick around long enough for the game to reach its potential."

I have a crap-top and I run it at about 30fps on a good day, but that doesn't take away from the play style. I read a few of the reviews and one point I do have to agree with is the momentum side of things. To compensate for this, I'd actually recommend a way to get rid of old armor which you might have set up for a particular playstyle. This would free up a slot for some mobility or damage boosting armor for another loadout. And while we're on the subject, the momentum side of things could be improved, but the first weapon powerup compensates for this. Whatever weapon you have in slot 1 of the loadout will automatically be upgraded as the match progresses, up to lvl 5 (if you respawn during the 5 seconds your team takes to kill the golden creep on titan mode). This does make it semi-fair, while adding the test of skill: can you outmaneuver your opponent long enough to gun (or cut) them down? For some, comebacks aren't a problem, and others never stand a chance. But I digress. Overall, on a scale of 1 to 10, I'd rate the game a 7-7.5, just because of optimization issues, connection bugs, and the armor sticking with you to the end."

If you are not familiar with SMNC, you should probably ignore this review :)This game will not scratch your SMNC itch. There are no classes, just loadouts. You can switch loadouts during a match. There are currently two game modes, and it switches back and forth between them: team deathmatch and Titan. It is the Titan mode that is most like SMNC. In Titan mode there are two giant robots that head from home to enemy base. When they meet, they fight each other. There are also barriers that come up and in the base there are some feeble defenses against titans. Once the Titan defeats the defenses in the base the game is over. So, it is sorta like SMNC... but with a single (albiet giant) 'bot.Teams are 5v5 and you can leave/join whenever.Death comes quickly, sort of like MNC or Turbo. You can build yourself and weapons up during the game with pickups, when you respawn you start that process over.Verdict: it may be a good game, but it is not an SMNC replacement. Perhaps 10-20% of SMNC gameplay elements.Outside of SMNC: I was not pulled in by the game on its own merits. There are plenty of other similar games out there, not sure how this is all that different."

The whole idea is a good one but when you start off you don't get a too informative tutorial where you don't know how to buy armour for ingame etc. Next therte is a game balancing issue. I was in a match where 1 team had lvl 20+ players whereas my team had lvl 4/5/6's.

I kid you not, a game where literally the entire world and all it's characters are made from untextured cubes, the game has framrate issues on lowerend pcs. secondly, on top of that, matches come standard with massive amounts of rubberbanding, and just general lag. players have a tendency to intermitently teleport all over the place (which is made worse due to the fact that there is a dash funtcion on several of the games weapons). at it's worst I had a case where I was in spawn, hit the dash button, and sprint buttons at the same time and started flickering back and forth for about half a second until I remateralized at the center of the map (come to think of it that would be a cool game mechanic. too bad it's just a massive glitch!)now that I've touched on the games massive technical issues, there are several game balance and design issue that I feel I should mention for starters the game has a really stupid progression system. basically because the game has moba elements, it has an in match crafting and resource system that acts very similarly to gold farming and item buying in mobas. it's a really neat mechanic IMO. the problem is that there is ANOTHER resource and crafting system OUTSIDE of matches that you have to use to craft the blueprints that you use in match to craft the items! I can't think of any other moba-esque game the forces you to unlock the ability to purchase in match items OUTSIDE OF MATCHES! and for good reason! it's really stupid! admittedly the default blueprints that they give you are pretty good, and it doesn't take much time to unlock all of the rest of them, but it's still unessecary, unjustified, and annoying for new players as it limits their ability to adapt their build.there are numerous other potentially game breaking balance issues, such as a sniper rifle that when fully powered up makes it's targets unable to move, which isn't very fun to play against, melee weapons are a bit too strong/easy to use, etc.TL;DR this game has truely amazing potential, but it's no where near there yet. I desparately want to reccomend this game, but right now it has so many major game breaking issue that I have to reccomend that you avoid it like the plague until they are fixed. I hope that someday I'll be able to take this review down and give this game all the praise that it otherwise deserves."

The weapons are balanced despite the claims about OP swords; all you really have to do when someone charges you with a sword is back up, jump continously, and shoot. Obviously they'll kill you in seconds if you let them close in on you, otherwise it'd be a pretty useless weapon. With that aside, the 3 game modes are varied; Horde, being the least fun in my opinion, is your basic how-many-waves-of-creeps-can-you-survive mode; Team Deathmatch is just that with the first team to 50 kills winning; Titan, being my favorite mode, is engaging, fun, and strategic for a game with such simple mechanics.What attracts me most in this game is the reward system: in-game, you have 6 loadouts with two primary weapons available with each, and with every kill you get with either weapon, the weapon upgrades in damage and effect up to 5 levels. However, you lose the level ups upon death. This keeps the game interesting by implementing a tide-like match, swaying back and forth if you aren't careful to stay alive with your upgrades. You collect Fragments and Shards from people, creatures, turrets, and structures that you destroy, which you use to craft and upgrade the armor that stays with you throughout each match; there are many different armor types for you to unlock, encouraging all types of gameplay from Samurai and Ninja armor, meant for hit-and-run playstyle, to Tactical and Olympian armor, meant for a tankier, frontline playstyle, to Disaster armor, for explosives and heavy weapon use if I remember correctly, to several others. Additionally, Minimum is very visually pleasing with all of its vivid colors, especially the increasingly molten glow of your enemies as you damage them. Out of match rewards stem from blueprints and schematics, a system that allows you to unlock all the goodies you want: new weapons, gadgets, and armor for your in-game loadout.The only downside I see is in the relatively scant amount of people who play this game (though when a match isn't full/somebody leaves, semi-challenging bots with pretty funny names will take empty spots), which is why I recommend you buy this with some friends you'd like to play with in mind.All in all, this is a very fun game to play and it's inexpensive enough that you could convince your friends to buy it and play with you, which makes for a much better experience. My only hope is that this game will pick up speed so that more updates, maps, weapons, and mechanics can come its way!"

The titan mode for example is really interesting, because it blends MOBA elements in different phases, which keep the pace of each round at the highest !The in-game weapon upgrade & armor crafting mechanic is nice too, and nicely balanced as far as I'm concerned. Your weapons have 5 upgrade levels, which get upgraded whenever you kill an ennemy (you have to secure the kill to get the upgrade though, which means you have to loot the blue item). I haven't played sniper yet, so I don't really understand how you're supposed to snipe from afar and yet collect the weapon upgrade of defeated ennemies :/Your weapon upgrade gets back to the minimum when you get killed, but in order to make it fair, that minimum level goes up to 3 throughout a game. So unless you don't craft any kind of armor, you won't get insta-killed after your first death.At the time of writing this review, here's my list of pro & cons:Pros :Simple design, yet beautiful graphics & effectsSolid matchmakingGunplay feels nice, and is quite balanced tooNice variety of maps & guns (would like a few more maps though)Cons :Many features are still lacking (at time of writing), such as weapon customization, craftable devices etc (greyed out, but should be coming)Sometimes, firing a weapon doesn't really follow your aim (due to the orientation of your character. Might be intended, but is annoying)I've noticed that most of the GUI doesn't properly update at times (in-game score tab, end-of-game XP recap, etc)That's about it really :)I wasn't expecting much of this game, but got pleasantly surprised !

76561197982843462,Recommended,214190,12520154,"Posted: 16 October, 2014",all,liquid.mango,"I would take any complaints about balance issues with a grain of salt.  Yes, if you're caught out of position by a sword-wielding opponent, you're dead.  Launchers are excellent on small maps where players tend to bunch up and are vulnerable to splash damage.On the other hand, if you pay attention to enemy positions and fight at range, swords are useless.  If you stay out of big melees and work the angles, launchers can be countered.  If there's any area where there are balance issues, I'd say it's in the armors.  A big portion of the armor selections are next-to-useless.  Which would you rather have: a helmet that gives a 5% damage bonus for shotguns and rifles, or a helmet that gives a 5% damage bonus for you AND all your nearby teammates for ALL WEAPONS?  Could use some tweaking.Strategy and teamwork are very important in this game.  Combining weapon loadouts that synergize, and choosing the right armor can make the difference between a useful loadout and one that can't get anything done.  I really appreciate how leveling up and unlocking new weapons and armor opens up new styles of play, while the starting weapons and armor never stop being useful.  Sticking together with your team is critical, as it's almost impossible to win a two-on-one fight (if your opponents know what they're doing anyway).The map design is great.  Mobility and positioning are a key element of strategy, particularly on Titan maps, which have opportunities for sword ganking, sniping, and everything inbetween.Personally, I've been waiting for a game to attempt this kind of art style for a long time.  It's very reminiscent of Mirror's Edge, so if you like the visual style of that game, you'll enjoy the look and feel of Minimum.That said, it really shows that the game is still in development.  There aren't a lot of servers, the automatching often puts you on servers with no players, I've exprienced some audio/visual bugs, and I'm pretty sure the ""Pickup Hell"" weapon, that claims to make creeps drop more items, doesn't actually do what it says.  On one of the Titan maps, I fell into a crack and was stuck until an opponent killed me (The Event).  I would like to see more maps, of course, and I feel that the Horde mode would be more fun if the difficulty level didn't ramp up quite so fast (I haven't seen anyone make it past the third wave without heavily exploiting the enemy AI and level design).Overall, a really fun third-person shooter that, I hope, will continue to improve.  It's $10 US, so buy it if you're sick of CoD.  What do you have to lose?"

I believe they are also why some of the maps feel very closed in and overall don't lend themselves to great shooter gameplay.Some weapons don't seem to offer any benefits over others, for example the cryo rifle looks to be superior to the rail rifle in every way despite the rail rifle having a delayed charged shot that you have to track while charging; it doesn't feel like it does more damage despite increased skill requirements. The grenade launcher seems to be inferior to the plasma launcher in every way. Swords are significantly more useful than shotguns, especially with more useful alt fires to escape with.Map design is the weakest aspect of the game likely because of the divided focus between shooting and melee.Maybe if they get things to a more balanced state and make some better maps it will be worth picking up in the future. As it stands it could be a fun for an afternoon diversion but not something you are going to play past that."
,Recommended,214190,10338693,"Posted: 3 June, 2014",all,Aresteele,"Minimum gives players exactly that. A bare minimum game without any high resolution details or environments because it doesn't need them. On it's own it already outshines other titles of the same genre. With objectives and game modes so simplisitc all that needs to be done is grab your gun and run into action. Titan Mode pits two mechanical behemoths against one another as players run around collecting crystals to help stengthen their massive ally all while blowing away the opposite team in blocky destruction. Customizable loadouts, armor selections and schematic crafting add to strategy and overall enjoyment.More than worth the money and with future improvements already on the way, this can only get better.A few suggestions for the devs- Implement a proper level matching system. Basically pitting players together of the equal level and skill.- Block off spawn containers once a player exits them. Too many people exploit the invulnerable aspect of them and shoot others while protected. Or at least prevent shooting from within them.- Lower sword melee damage. Base damage on swords seems a bit OP for single blades, dual blades can be an exception.- Armor crafting should be a sperate loadout option same as weapons. This can allow players to know what they want ahead of time and not hold up their teams with decisions. Armor leveling should be done at the respawn screen.- Tweak gun accuracy- Add interchangable mods to weapon loadouts"

This is when it becomes unbalanced. The more experienced players tend to work together rather than running solo. This ends up making the the newer players having a difficult time being able to compete. In the end, the newer players get pushed back into spawn until they all move out together which often end up killing the geared experienced players. Several times me and my friends almost beat the enemy team in the first titan clash where we would usually break the first wall and do some damage on the second. We all knew what to do and how to start off while the other team didn't. You can solo pretty well, but if your team isnt working together, you will often loss.As for the swords being overpowered, it is both true and false. Swords do great amount of damage but their reach is somewhat short. To counter this, just carry a loadout with taser shotgun or cryo sniper, this is a perfect counter to all melee users. One or two shots will stop them in their place, keep your distance and finish them off with another weapon, the slow effect last about 4 seconds  which is enough to finish them off. You could also just stay near a friendly turrent which can be used as a decoy to distract the enemy and finish them off."

,Recommended,214190,12143794,"Posted: 18 September, 2014",all,Gary III,"[BRIEF]- Minimum is a great, fast-paced, well-rounded 3rd person shooter. I have recommended this game to several of my friends. This is a cheap shooter game that stands out from other games such as CoD and BF simply because it's a geometric-like game. A game can have blocks without being compared to Minecraft, so let it go. The developers chose to do this sort of art style most likely for two common reasons: They wanted to stand out and they wanted to spend more time on the engine. The game runs very well on my computer, the servers are 90% reliable, and there are many more features that are currently being implemeted in the game.[MICROTRANSACTIONS]- I'm sick of them, you're sick of them, he's sick of them.. who isn't? The developers have cut the price of the game from $20 to $10. They need the extra cash. At the time of me writing this review, they are purely cosmetic aswell. Each ""cosmetic"" item in this shop has an equivalent that can be obtained by playing the game.[GAMEPLAY]- I love this game. It runs so smoothly! I was amazed that the game was actually exactly how the trailer showed. I have enjoyed a couple of hours playing this game and I play on spending many more. It's like a mixture of Call of Duty, Titan Fall, and League of Legends.[GRAPHICS]- The game is pretty. It's not meant to have top-notch graphics, the developers wanted to make a fun game that's really cheap and can run on computers that are in mint-condition.[IMPROVEMENTS AND SUGGESTIONS]- Some weapons are clearly better than others. Anyone that has played Minimum for at least 15 minutes can honestly say that the swords are too op. I believe that swords should be at least half of the power that they currently have. I have purchased the grenade launcher and the fork launcher, I believe that the launchers should get at least a 25% speed buff because anyone with the starter weapons can kill you more efficiently. To get a kill with these weapons, you need to basically steal someone else's kill! I feel awful doing it so I stick to starter weapons most of the time.[MOST IMPORTANT SUGGESTION]- If I had to choose one thing, I would ask if the drops from players can have a 3-5 second shield on them for the killer because figuratively speaking, 75% of the time some dude with a sword rushes my kill and takes the drops.[ENDING THOUGHT]- In conclusion, I would highly recommend this game to anyone who likes games such as Dota, League of Legends, Call of Duty, Battlefield, and Gears of War."

Graphics are suprisingly good despite the simplistic appearance (The effects compensate neatly). Weapons are pretty balanced.-People seem to say that once a weapon is charged it gets OP. Now tough i can't deny that if you go 1vs1 against one with higher upgrade you will probably fail, but in group fights it tends to even out as the ones with upgraded weapons will be the biggest target for the enemy group. The true cause of this ""upgraded is OP"" debate is that if you are a skilled player you will get the upgrades fast. The best players ive seen sofar always seem overpowered, but they are simply awesome.-Microtransactions: *sigh* as demanded by the corporate overlords at Atari the game does have Microtransactions. i can clearly see that is the cause as it seems like a fish out of water.

The weapons and armor really change the type of play style from match to match, and no weapon is really over powered. Then there is titan mode, which involves your team killing and collecting passive mobs to power up a titan. Once both teams have powered up their titans, the two titans will fight, and they are also open to enemy attach. The point of this game mode is to escort your titan to the enemy's base where it can attack their ""core"" and win the game.There is a third game mode, but it is a four person game mode in a zobie style survival mode. I haven't had the chance to play this game mode, so I cannot comment on it.Overall, I would reccomend this game to anyone that likes to play FPS games (this is a third person shooter, but that doesn't hinder the gameplay in any way) or even if you don't.

,Recommended,214190,12118923,"Posted: 16 September, 2014",all,Ugly Coyote,"6/10Pretty standard. If you've ever played Battlefield, CoD, Star Wars Battlefront, Counter Strike, Gears of War or Halo then you've played this.Rather than bring anything new, this is just a competent, run of the mill and safe third person shooter with no new or interesting mechanics, no dedicated server hosting (as of yet), one somewhat interesting game mode (titan mode) and a few flavors of gun to play around with.The controls are very responsive, but movement is limited to sprinting and jumping with a few weapon specific boosts/bonuses. The starting katana teleports you forward, the starting shotgun lets you super jump.The Weapons are, like everything else about this game, standard. You have your starting shotgun, sniper and assault rifle. Every weapon has an alternate fire and the prices for unlocking them are something you can manage in 10-15 games, assuming you win/perform well. You can unlock the weapons in whatever order you want. There are a few different flavors of sniper, rifle, shotgun, grenade launcher and Sword.As you play in a match, you gain points which unlock armors that improve your health and give you a stylish look. Different armors can be bought. Killing a player drops a boost which upgrades your held weapon. If you're using the starting Katana, you get two that attack faster/deal more damage. If you're using assault rifle, you get 4 extra barrels that shoot in a fan in front of you.The audio is present, by which I mean you can tell where enemies are by their gunfire and movement.You and your enemies can take a good deal of damage and only the snipers can deal one shot deaths, though performing a headshot is tricky as the animations are quite erratic. You're unlikely to die without warning unless you get ganged up on.This game has Microtransactions, but they are cosmetic only. Kudos to the devs on that.The game requires a log in and creation of an Mber account.TL;DR Minimum is a standard and decently executed third person shooter that brings nothing new to the genre and lacks a few key features needed for a successful multiplayer shooter (dedicated servers/custom games), though these MAY be added at a later date. The games lifespan depends on this.I recommend it only because its 5 dollars as of now. It's dirt cheap, so go for it. I likely won't be playing it again.6/10"
,Not Recommended,214190,12114785,"Posted: 15 September, 2014",all,Kenshiro,"Nice and simple review.Pros- Fast paced shooter, UT/Quake/any arena based shooter, really.- Awesome concept of being able to upgrade guns and armour, multiple times.- Decent variety of weapons, with multiple types of guns in the same category.  (Different snipers, rifles, shotguns, etc.)- Giant Rock 'Em Sock 'Em robots.- Satisfying kills- Snipers are pretty useless.  Huzzah.Cons- Servers are beyond terrible at the moment.  A lot of ""rubber-banding"" and flat out disconnecting.- Not very beginner friendly.  There is a tutorial, but the game lacks a map screen and directive for new players.  Can leave you feeling bewildered.- KATANA IS OVERPOWERED.  Oh.  My.  God.  The game would be about 5x better if this thing was nerfed.  The maps are rather small and the corners are plentiful, so someone rocking a maxed out Katana can turn a corner and annihilate you in a couple seconds while you scramble to jump and get away, which is damn near futile since the range of the swords seem immense.  My biggest gripe of the game so far... Even worse than the connection issues.- Some guns just feel useless, and the amount of resources it takes to unlock a new one will leave you running a grindfest for quite the while.- Microooooooo traaaaaansaaaaactiooooooooooons.  Booooooo.Overall, I feel as if the game shouldn't have been released yet.  The connection issues and the occassional glitch are rather overwhelming at times, and the weapon balancing is poor.  For a ""Shooter"".... The melee weapon sure is the primary choice of almost everyone.  If you buy this, expect at least 60%+ of a lobby to be running swords.  That's if you can connect and stay in a game, anyways.6/10."

,Recommended,214190,12094491,"Posted: 14 September, 2014",all,Crispy Fandango,"This is a very limited, 2.5 hour impression but I feel I have a solid argument. Take it as you will.The chief complaint right now is that melee is overpowered and it is impossible to turn a game around if people are doing very well. For my time with the game I have not noticed this. I've joined games late and helped a losing team win and created a stand still as a team was about to lose.Playing this game you will come across lots of players using melee. It's very powerful and flashy and fun. The thing is, this should be treated with more attention as a MOBA. In MOBA games you don't bum rush into a fight you can't win, and you don't stick around when♥♥♥♥♥♥is hitting the fan. With my four bullet capacity sniper rifle I've taken down many melee users face-to-face.The thing is, this game provides lots of oppotunity to make better of your own situation, but I think people don't even take that into consideration when they play a game with guns. They think any one gun should be able to take another without any work, or strategy, or understanding of movement as if this were just a run-stop-shoot-heal-repeat game like the boring ""stand offs"" in a game like Call of Duty. If you think you can't win a fight, or you get caught off guard, RUN.Running and sprinting in this game make fighting hectic and engaging. Of course you're going to die by the double sword guy if you  just stand there and try to bullet hose him. YOU SHOULD DIE. In what world is it the proper thing to do to just let the melee guy beat you while you shoot bullets? You have a gun! Create distance from him or remove yourself from the fight altogether!Time and time again I've been surprised by a melee user or one with a fully upgraded grenade launcher. And in most cases I've been able to kill them. I tossed a grenade at an angle or against the ground where I knew it would either hurt them greatly or spook them, run and jumped to take my cover and regain full health, then taken the fight on my own terms. If you've been ambushed or caught in close quarters by a melee there's no reason to stand your ground. It's always harder to hit something flailing around and jumping in a twitch shooter. Why aren't people doing this? Instead I see people get mowed down like grass as a guy sprints around with twice swords and they're surprised. What are you surprised about? You just stood there and took it!Understandably, my hit and run tactics play directly into the fact that I use a sniper rifle and this may not help other weapon users, but like any MOBA and even any shooter in particular, there are classes and roles to take.Don't fight anyone on their terms. You don't have to stand your ground and take abuse. It's not impossible to get away from a flailing samurai. I've done it countless times and made them pay for it."

The lighting detail and particle detail seems to be most of the strain, the detail of these alone can't be changed.You can't fine tune the video settings much. The only detail settings are culling, texture, world, and shadow. There's also the normal resolution, and vsync settings.Lag is an issue in the game. I have had some rubberbanding issues in every game I have played.Winning seems to depend solely on what team can kill more creeps between titan spawns.If one team has more people that could upgrade their weapons, they will win."

It has found a balance between simplicity and amazing value.It has just the right amount of customization (not too much to slow you down and enough to keep you entertained for a long time) and you can be a totally different fighter every match.Pros:You don't need a great computer to enjoy the great things this game has to offer. Just tone down the settings a bit if your computer is outdated (the way this game is setup, it looks pleasing on any setting).Good developers who actually give a **** about player's opinions.Cool game modes (I like titan fights but I play team deathmatch just as much).Good bots (actually fight and folow objectives and are coded pretty well).The leveling and scavanging system are setup better than any shooter I've played so far (and thats saying a lot considering the amount of time I've played shooters when I used to be a console peasant).Cons:Bots (NPCs used to fill lobby's when not many players are on your current server) say the same things over and over and are slightly annoying.

,Recommended,214190,16542990,"Posted: 19 June, 2015",all,Midnight™,"One of the best multiplayer games I've played in a LONG time. I'm incredibly picky about my multiplayer shooters and I tend to dislike the typical war-shooter copy paste that's going around nowadays. Minimum is a barebones shooter where your skill is determined by how fast you can maneuver and how well you can aim.Minimum is a fast-paced, strategic twitch shooter with solid, simplistic gameplay and so much more to come. ThereISa community playing this game right now,  and people do keep up with it. It only takes about 4 seconds to connect to a match with all 10 people. The developersDOrelease updates fairly often, and they're high quality and expansive. I bought the game when it came out and even before the content they've added the game was good.Things to like:- The art style fits the game very well. The game doesn't have any sort of premise, so it doesn't try to fit any strict stylistic rules. The result: Firemen astronauts with Barney heads being attacked by raptors.- At the same time, the environments look very good. The map design is fluid and clean while having tremendous asthetic appeal. Maps have a well-organized balance of long range and close quarters areas.- Gameplay is very solid and clean. No frills, just skills. There are guns, giant grenade launchers and flaming swords to fit any playstyle. The better you are at aiming in two dimensions (something most modern shooters don't train you for) the better you'll be at this game.- Developers talk with the community! There's a thread on steam regarding weapon balancing and ideas, there's a website with forums for users to talk with developers, and the devs listen!- Matches have incredibly good back and forth. I've played matches where my team was seconds from losing only to take the next ten minutes making a coordinated effort pushing back and winning the match.- Movement is fast and smooth, akin to playing scout in Team Fortress 2. Except now you can play as a scout with flaming swords and a sniper rifle.- If you don't like multiplayer (or just need a break), there's a really fun horde mode where you face off against ninjas, raptors and knights.- It isn't free to play! This means you can actually have fun! Players can't buy weapons to have an advantage over you. There are skins for sale in game, but they're actually easy enough to get without spending any money. Because of Minimum's integration with steam's inventory system, you can trade and sell items you get by playing for skins you might want. I traded a few weapons for a pretty kickass shinobi armor set that I use all the time.Things to be aware of:- Balancing is a little tricky at the moment. It's easy to get frustrated at players that have the game figured out a little better than you might.- Getting kills buffs you, dying detriments you. This sounds frustrating, but with the way the game is balanced it isn't too much of a challenge. If you take time to practice and figure out what works best for you, it won't matter that you were killed and lost your level five weapon because you'll know how to earn it back.- Obviously still some bugs and lag issues, as this game is still being developed. Getting rubberbanded every few matches is a little annoying but I'm sure it will be resolved eventually. However, the servers are generally very good. I usually have a ping of 20ms or less.So I hope me writing this enourmous review will convince a few people to pick up this game while it's on sale. It's only $4 right now, and we could always use more players."

76561197990604326,Not Recommended,214190,13880056,"Posted: 7 January, 2015",all,Zekko,"This game is flawed in a myriad of ways, but the most important one is this: it's boring. So incredibly boring. The variety of the weapons and the level design is so low you've pretty much seen it all within an hour of playing.This game is not fairThere's this idiotic system where kills upgrade your weapon, but dying resets it. This means the rich get richer and the poor stay poor. While I enjoy a good hunt on a player who's topping the charts, it should be about skill - not whoever gets the lucky first kill. Once someone gets ahead, the rest of his team picks up the spoils for his kills and get equally beefy. This means the match is pretty much decided by this point. Armor stays between lives, but most of the options are more of a trade-off than a downright improvement like the weapon upgrades.You need a pretty beefy machine to run thisDo not be fooled by the game's lack of textures and low polygon count; your system will struggle like a moped trying to haul an elephant, and the fact that the elephant appears to be wearing a corset doesn't help very much. Even the main menu isn't smooth. I run a Radeon 7670M for a graphics card, which is not much but enough to run most games at low to medium settings smoothly. It can run Far Cry 3 no problem. But this game... even witheverythingset to minimum (including turning shadows off completely and running at a lower resolution), this game STILL didn't hit the stable 60 FPS mark. 30 FPS may be fine for some games, but this game is very twitchy; not to the extend of, say, Doom, but twitchy enough you're at a disadvantage running at anything below stable 60 FPS.It isn't finishedEven the tutorial text says features are still missing. Besides, there's plenty of bugs. I often got a second aiming reticule drawn on screen and was unable to get rid of it, leaving me to guess as to which one was the one which actually indicated where my bullets will go. If the match starts while you're in the menus it'll force you back to the main menu. Energy cores often disappear when titans hit them. The news on the main menu displays 'Lorem ipsum' text while it loads. When you select 'titan' as the game mode and hit the server browser, it'll take you to a shoddy webpage and show you all game modes anyway. Oh, and there's no server names or ping display, making it very likely you'll pick a server halfway across the world with terrible lag.Some minor annoyancesThe game's own account system which the unnecessary password restrictions (it needs to contain at least 7 characters which one capital letter and one number). The keyboard input lag when entering said password. The unexplained glow on the titans when they first spawn (I'm assuming this means they're invulnerable at that time). Stats on the weapons (damage, firerate, etc.) are nowhere to be found, making your guess as to which weapon to unlock next as good as any. The sheer number of different pick-ups that all look the same, especially in the heat of the moment. Nowhere is it explained that health regenerates (it becomes apparent pretty fast, but I'd sooner associate making someone glow with a power-up, not being low on health). Aim assist and mouse smoothing are on by default. The giant hitboxes on titans, making it impossible to shoot enemies behind them. The jerky animations on the titans. The ledges that look like you don't have to jump over them, but you do. There's no hit indicator on the titan. You get the point. I also find the 3rd person view very cumbersome on a twitchy shooter like this, but that may be personal.ConclusionsNope. Don't get this. Save your money. Even if you can stand all the aforementioned problems, the gameplay really isn't that good. There's only so many weapons and they're all slight variations on a simple sniper, shotgun, launcher, or sword. The levels are all very similar. Games are decided way too quickly. It's simplyboring. The idea with the titans and the creeps is interesting (though nothing new), but the execution is just abysmal. If you're looking for an FPS with a little bit of MOBA mixed in (like I was), Titanfall really does the whole creep thing a lot better, and you can actually pilot the titans in that game. If you want the big titan to protect and move forward, Team Fortress 2's cart mode is vastly superior (not to mention free and runs like a dream on old hardware).Nothing to see here, move along."

It seems like a lot of the weapons and gear are very unbalanced. I use 4 different weapons, but people always accuse me of using noob weapons, so I don't know. Apparantly there is a big hacker problem, but I haven't noticed it. I only make assumptions about there being a hacker problem because forums have said it and I constantly get accused of being one.As for the community, it's not very friendly. For a game toted as being ""team-based"" no one communicates, and when they do its an enemy player accusing you of hacking or using noob weapons. Players get salty very fast. The teams are small, so if you are leading your team in kills, the enemy team is gonna get real sick and tired seeing your name pop up every time you kill them.The game modes are fun. Titan Mode is the main game mode, where you protect your Titan and power it up between phases. Again, this is a mode made for team tactics, but no one communicates. When people start losing they start accusing their team of sucking, even though everyone is just trying to kill each other except for that one person playing the objective.Sorry for the long review, but I have a lot to say about this game. Could've been really good, but the devs abandoned it and the players made it toxic. Now I just play because I get a weird amusement from being accused of hacking, or having players cuss me out because they are too salty to enjoy the game, because it is just a game after all.If you're gonna pick up, do it when it's on sale. It'll drop to 4.99 again at some point, and if your don't like it you can always return it.

I think the thing that makes this game stand out the most is it's art design and it's array of weapons. Although there may not be that many weapons right now, each one gives an extremely unique play-style, letting you find the perfect weapon to suit you. There's a lot of complaints that the swords in the game are OP as ♥♥♥♥, but the people that say that don't know how to play the game. Overall, the only thing I don't enjoy about the game is the lack of overall ""stuff"" to do, but that's to be expected for a game that just came out of early access.All I can say is GIVE THIS GAME A TRY, YOU JUST MIGHT LIKE IT.Edit: I realize my remark on swords in the game is wrong. The more I play the game, the more I realize that this is a flaw that I just can't find a way to play around. I don't want swords to be removed from the game, but they are a cheap way to win at the game. (please don't spam swords).Edit: I've been playing the game more and more (obviously) and the more I play, the more I love this game. I might sound like a fanboy, but this game has struck a chord with me not even tf2 did.

,Not Recommended,214190,14305796,"Posted: 2 February, 2015",all,MD,"A bad server browser, poor audio and visual effects design, a limited amount of maps and imbalanced melee weapons bring down would could have been a well-off third person shooter.The server browser button opens up a spreadsheet in a window in the steam overlay and from it you can see the IP, player count, and gamemode of each server but you CANNOT see the ping. I don't know of a solid multiplayer title that does display ping times in the server browser. Even in game I assume the ping amount that is seen in the scoreboard is false. I have 20-28 ping yet am rubberbanding and seeing delays in item pickups, delays in player deaths, and am not seeing all bounce minigun projectiles appear while firing is how I assume the ping number is false.The audio fades out when you are at low health and even before then, many weapons sound as powerful as water pistols, like the speed shotgun. The audio fade makes it very difficult to hear incoming fire, and does not do a good job of discerning the already blocky(literrally) weapons one another. The visual choices of what should be displayed in the HUD(hint - a healthbar, which isn't) don't really make sense. Your equipment recharge icon is very small so it's difficult to tell when exactly it will be ready again. Instead of a health bar you can see how much health you have by purely guessing from how yellow and bright your body is. Seriously, there is not way of understanding exactly how much health you have at any one time. This game more than many others should show your health amounts, especially when there are weapon upgrades that do more damage the more they are upgraded, and when armor pieces either increase damage done to you or increase maximum health or increase resistances to certain damage types. If it was a game with fixed health amounts and fixed weapon damages then I could understand, I wouldn't need to know the exact amount of hp to see if I am winning a fight or not, or whether or not I can peak one more time for an extra shotgun blast for a kill, knowing I can trade a hit and still win. In this game you just guess. In addition to those poor visual design choices there are the effects. Upgrading your katanas will allow you to have fire burst in a significant area around you, many times making sight impossible past the fire. having very bright and obnoxious weapon effects on characters makes trying to tell the already innacurate hp to brightness system even worse.A perfect example of bad sound design is the fact that there is a hitmarker placed near your crosshair everytime you land a hit and the option of turning on hit sounds. Even the designer(s) knew it was bad.But all of this is still bearable, despite the sounds, server browser, visuals, the unlock system being quite a pain to grind through and the maps being very few, the game itself is very fun... until someone uses the katanas.The katanas, any type really, are the strongest weapon in the game and are very overpowered. They kill faster than any weapon in the game, have a large hit radius(even vertically) and do not require any ammunition or aim, as they will turn you in the direction of your opponent on every attack. The only way to kill a player with a katana is to kill them before they get close to you which is very difficult when you can see around corners with the 3rd person camera, can sprint and can use the alternate fire button to instantly close the distance on an opponent. Coupled with the fact that many weapons have a very substantial time to kill, unless you are in a very open area and the katana-wielder is far away, they will get to you 4/5 times and at that point you will not get away. They are simply ridiculous and most TDM matches come down to how many people are using katanas on each time. Every other weapon in the game requires you to put the enemy in your crosshair while trying to get yourself out of theirs. The katanas don't care and sword fights boil down to 2 players spamming attacks wildly and uncontrollably in an attempt to kill the other player. Due to the fact katanas can close gaps instantly means they are massively overpowered and have no direct counter other than using certain items to evade and run away from the sword."

,Not Recommended,214190,12183782,"Posted: 21 September, 2014",all,FourFirstNames,"So how is it that this game is supposed to be fun?In the few matches I played, there seemed to be little use in creating a strategy that would work against more seasoned players. This was compounded by the fact that swords seem to be overpowered (faster movement + more damage). Add it all up and what I was left with feeling was frustration that there seems to be little to no hope at 'getting better' since you only live a few seconds, die, and all that non-learning-curve losing just enables an already-knowledgable team to get even farther ahead in the match.It's basically a snowball effect of initial loss creates greater loss, while people who have seemingly been playing longer exploit that to it's fullest. Which I suppose is fine for them...but I'd be worried by how far the community can grow, if the only incentive for playing is being crushed regularly, and thoroughly.Which is a shame too - I bought a pack of this thinking it would be something fun for my friends and I to play. Now I will urge them against an installation altogether. I'm actually the one out of us who has some patience for punishing gameplay, and even I think the amount of overkill you can experience strangles any chance of learning and becoming better out of a losing match.It's unfortunate, because mechanically Minimum is interesting. It reminds me of Monday Night Combat, except skills and classes are replaced by gear, and there's an emphasis on escorting Titans (at least in that mode) and improving them that, in theory, means different people could play different roles.As it is though, the game is woefully imbalanced towards swords, and further punishing a losing team to the point of discouragement, than learning through loss. I'd rather take a more balanced experience like TF2 over this as it is."

If it's ever back, even as fully free, I wouldn't recommend it. Go play Gigantic instead.""Minimum"" is a fitting name. There is minimal innovation here, and the minimum number of active players for it to not be officially dead. There's nothing overwhelmingly bad about Minimum, it's just average. The store page makes comparisions to twitch shooters and MOBAs, neither elements actually exist in the game. Combat is third-person and rather slow, with regenerating health and unlimited ammo. Strategy is pretty barren, as all characters are the same. Some weapons can provide utility in area control or slowing enemies, but they must be crafted in the awkward Blueprints system.The core game mode is team deathmatch with minor lane-pushing elements. Two titans spawn and meet in the lane, while everyone shoots them or shoots each other. Killing enemies lets you pick up orbs to ""customize"" your weapons in linear upgrades. ""Customize"" normally means options, but this is all automatic. These upgrades are decreased when you die, which means youcanweaken a fed opponent, but good luck. Armor can be applied and upgraded, which offers some real choices, but those upgrades are never lost in death. An opponent with max weapons and max armor will always be a problem. To make snowballing worse, there is a creep-farming period after both titans die. The team with more damage will destroy creeps quicker, and pressure the weaker team from farming creeps. The next Titan spawn will consistently be stronger for the snowballing team, enabling them to trap the weaker team in the spawn. A titan with creep advantage will win the fight and push naturally, and the only way to stop it is for the weaker team to shoot it down. Base turrets are pitiful against Titans, and there is little to stop opponents from filling your base with unlimited bullets while hugging cover.The graphics style is interesting, but the game lacks engagement. Unlocking content is a confusing process with 4 different unlocking resources in apaid game. The progression system is trying to keep players hooked, but it clearly hasn't worked. Despite developer statements of over 120 thousand sales, there are only a few hundred active players. Seehttp://steamcommunity.com/app/214190/discussions/0/622954747296773845/for details.I got the game at 50% off at full launch, and I'm not really mad about that. I'm just not passionate about the game, and clearly thousands of people agree. It could be interesting, but it doesn't do much different. It feels like Loadout, but that game is faster, free, and offers unique weapons without massive snowballing designs. Titan mode doesn't change Team Deathmatch and is nowhere near a MOBA. The MNC games did that far better. Almost no one is playing Minimum, and everything is multiplayer. The game doesn't do anything great enough to justify consideration, and I don't see new content other than maps and skins. The potential was taken to the minimum, and playerbase rests at the minimum, how fitting."

,Not Recommended,214190,13953627,"Posted: 11 January, 2015",all,Red Inferno-,Poorly designed game overall. At first it was kinda fun when we had 3 of us on a team but then one guy got on the other team showing just how bad the game is.The shotgun speeds you up the more you kill and you pair that with berserker armour(base armour) and you run very fast with even more damage. A lot of levels also work perfectly to just go around with the shotgun and kill everyone. We all essentially just switched to the shotgun at the end because it was the only way to truely keep up.The titan fighting seems cool but it's rather basic and they just seem to be giant sponges with little indication of how to kill them. The defenses seem rather medicore to actually kill it and if your team(or in most cases bots) just give free kills to the enemy they will level up rapidly and causing the balance to go to them.The game is flawed in design because you need actually balanced teams to make it work which as EVERY game can't seem to do balance.I would rather go play COD: Advanced Warfare on PC which sucks almost as badly(still sucks).

Only Negative is that there isnt really any servers BUT u can host your own and when I hosted a server for that session players joined very fast. U can find the server tool at ""C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\SteamApps\common\Minimum\Binaries\MinimumLauncher"" remember to open ports 8015 and 27015 (maybe also 7777 im not sure).Gameplay:Basically its 3rd person shooter whit little twist in it. When u kill enemies the drop ""fragments"" which u use to upgrade your armor. U also need to find some ""crystal sharps"" to upgrade your armor and those can be found some places of the map. U can upgrade your helmet, chestplate and leg armor max lvl for each of those is 3. U also can upgrade your weapon to lvl 5 by collectin ""power ups"" and u get those by killing enemies. When u die your gun lvl restarts but armor lvl will stay for the whole match. Everyone knows what team deathmatch is like so ill skip that. In Titan game mode there is 2 teams and both of them have 1 Titan. U basically need to get your Titan to enemy bace and let it destroy their core. On the way are walls and turrets. Also u need to destroy enemy Titan for your Titan to be able to reach enemy bace where the core is located. When Titans die Creeps will start spawning. Creeps will drop ""Titan crystals"" when killed. By collecting ""Titan crystals"" you titan will gain more hp. When timer is up both Titans will respawn and the more u collected ""Titan crystals"" the more your Titan will have hp.I havent played Horde gamemode yet so I cant say anything about it.Minimum Wiki had article about Ranked game mode but I dont know how to find match it or if its available anymore.Pros:Many different weaponsMany different armorsGood mapsGood gamemodes (atleast titan and team deathmatch I havent tried that horde game mode yet)Easy to host server (u need to open 2 or 3 porst: 8105, 27015 and maybe 7777)People join fast to your server if u decide to host oneNice graphics (very personal opinion)Cons:Badly optimizedNot many servers onlineCould have more playersI havent made this long review before and I tryed my best.

Yes, the glitches are there, but not adundant. It is definitely not refined, but what do you expect?

It really takes away from the fun when you are restricted to only one mode. Personally, i think if it went free-to-play it would attract a lot more attention, gain more popularity, and way more people would be playing it. The crafting system i didn't get to see much of so i can't give my fully developed opinion on, but it seemed really cool that you have to craft the weapons rather than unlocking them like ine every other shooter game.

Sniper rifles and shotguns are basically the bottom of the barrel.So nice graphics, gameplay, feel, gamemodes, music.Not so good balance and or community (they dont seem to do a very good job or i just get alot of easy matches)Could be people play pvp and not titan, works for meOverall an 8/10 game, really love it.

Actually its not a bad game, don't let the cover judge the book. but it has its share of flaws. Down below I will list up all the things I noticed through our game session with friends. But first.Pros / ConsJust a quickie..Pros.Great concept. [The Titan gamemode in this case]Interesting game styles.Fast paced action.Minimalism done right.Teamwork needed to win.Crafting and Market mechanism.Awesome visuals.That oughta' summed up the game.ConsThe actions sometimes become unpredictable. [eg. Cutting people for an hour and dont die]Lag spikes and low framerate on 4+cores and 4gb ramHitboxes for objects too big. [Sentry, Titans ... Can't move away beside them]If playing in a party, It mostly never gives you the same team. Happens with 3+ people.I got this game for 5€ in the Team Pack for me and my friends, And we didn't /entirely/ regret getting the game, But it is good, Because it packs enough adrenaline it pulls you back to play more until you eventually tire out. It has badass swordplays, Sick gunfights and OP sniper shooting ranges. Like mentioned, The only setback is the lack of optimalisation. Even for a game with such low graphics can lag hard on good computers such as mine or my friends'. It kinda ruins the fun, But surely makes up later in-game. In overall, Buy the game to support the developers. It has room for development.I'd say: 7/10. Great game."

No amount of money can introduce advantage to anyone.[opinion]Art style[/opinion]Level design (balanced, varied, thematic, and [opinion]beautiful[/opinion])Addictive[opinion]FUNFUNFUN[/opinion]GRAFFICSCONS:GRAFFICS (not very optimized as of yet)No DX9 support. IMHO to appeal to a wider audience, they should support DX9. I can see the Titan mode being a popular e-sport because it's a simple game, yet there are so many elements to take care of when trying to complete the objective. Think DOTA. I don't play it, but I know that even people with the most minimal hardware can play and be very good at it.Menu UI can definitely be improved (non-gameplay sections)I'd like to add another point to the cons section, which iswonky netcode(?) but I'm not sure if it's justified. Currently I'm running on a mediocre-at-best hardware setup, with all the graphics feature set to the minimum, and I've seen reports of players with more than sufficient setups having only around 30-45fps. I'm pretty sure I didn't get more than 24fps, and it's really hard to hit anything. I've had myself and seen other people rubberband. Not sure if it's my network, my hardware, or the netcode.

The team has worked tirelessly to bring the game back into a playable state.Before the game went down I spent a load of time on all 3 game modes. The combat is fluid and adaptable. Your character is responsive and agile. They are robust enough for new players to get into the game, but fragile enough that the element of suprise still plays a large factor in deciding who wins a 1 on 1 combat scenario.One of the biggest criticisms of the game is that players using melee weapons are nearly invincible compared to other weapons. I've never had an instance where swords were decidedly unkillable, as mentioned in other reviews. Like any game, players need to adapt their playstyle to the weapon they use. Machine guns will not work well in cramped spaces. Likewise, swords are next to useless in wide spaces. Your weapon decides what lanes you take.I have encountered two bugs, a texture error that does not affect gameplay whatsoever, and a leaderboard glitch that should be fixed with the new netcode the team is writing.For me, the lack of gore is a huge bonus. I can play it with my young cousins without complaints from their parents.When this game is playable again, I would recomend it to anyone looking for any type of non-military shooter."

,Not Recommended,214190,12624699,"Posted: 25 October, 2014",all,Dijkstra,"Please note: I don't recommend this game because it still feels too fresh from Early Access to be worth buying. To be sure, the dev crew does deserve support, but I think another content and balance update or two is necessary before buying is really worth it.Minimum is a game that currently feels like it's stuck at a crossroads and can't decide which way to turn.The art and audio direction are both excellent. They are the main drawing points that initially got my attention. The game is very clean and simple both to the eye and ear, which makes seeing the game extremely pleasurable. But it's the gameplay where Minimum really tries to be unique.Imagine Quake Live in third person. Now add in systems common to traditional Dota-like games. You farm creeps to power up your team's titan, which you then assist in beating the crap out of the enemy's titan. From there you escort your titan as it destroys the enemy's defensive walls (akin to towers in a MOBA) as it marches to the core (or ancient in other games), which then achieves victory for your team. Rather interesting and original, combining these two concepts.But here's where the game hits a snag. They have another unique mechanic: fragging players results in them dropping a pick up that in turn increases your weapon by adding damage and extra effects (such as AOE, multiple rounds per shot, a movement slow, etc.) Furthermore, dying resets your weapons back to zero (there is a caveat here: your PRIMARY WEAPON ONLY will retain its level, up to 3, with each titan spawn; so after the first titan, your primary stays level 1, the second it'll always be level 2, and from the third till match end, it'll always be level 3). I know what you're thinking, and unfortunately, you're correct. If you're very good at fragging, the power balance is almost guaranteed to stay in your favor. Because level five weapons make fragging enemy players, farming creeps, and defending your titan much easier than level three weapons, you really only can maintain your momentum in the match unless you simply suicide into the enemy team without defending yourself.There is also a part on armor crafting. With armor, you collect materials during the match from slain players and creeps, or as pickups around the map. The armor you craft gives you an innate damage resistance, as well as neat abilities or added defenses (things such as extra health, a double jump, increased damage with certain weapons, etc.). Armor, luckily enough, is permanent for the match duration once crafted.Creep farming is also somewhat...weird. You see, towards the end of the creep farming time, a golden creep will spawn. This creep drops a golden titan crystal that counts as 10 regular creep crystals and basically gives your titan some extra ""oomph!"" This golden creep is currently unmarked on your screen, meaning a player that knows its spawn location, will camp it, always netting the golden crystal for his team. This crystal usually does two things: make all the regular creeps you farmed mean nothing by evening the scores, or giving the team that secures it an unbeatable titan crystal margin.Besides that, the menu suffers from this weird frame drop issue, the UI doesn't explain weapons and armors fully enough (armors aren't even noted as having passive resistance - I learned this from the devs themselves on their stream!), and winning...earns you the exact same amount of crafting materials (the stuff you need to unlock weapon blueprints and armors, as well as craft weapon so you can actually use them in-game) as you do for losing. Your performance and whether you win or not currently mean absolutely nothing as of the last time I played. Which only leaves me asking ""why even play this game?"" after a match.Lastly, the matchmaking system is terrible. Long wait times, frequently being matched against more skilled players with a larger weapon variety than you, and most disappointingly, an apparently rapidly deteriorating player base (Search the game on SteamCharts. I was appalled by the data returned, and even a sizable margin of error wouldn't make a big improvement.).To be honest, Minimum has loads of potential and is very distinct in both gameplay and visuals. But these more glaring issues (Did I mention the 2-3 hit kill, AOE, large hitbox, frame-locking katanas with a built-in dash ability? No? Petty gripe then.) really make this game suffer. But potential is just that: potential. It looks promising, but is not an actual promise. It still feels very much alpha. The good news is that the devs are constantly working and dealing with the community on their weekly streams. Time will tell if this becomes the great game it has the potential to be. For now, it's worth watching, but not buying into just yet. I personally hope for the best."

When I say minimalistic, I mean it in a good way. The blocky theme gives it its own unique feel to it, something completely different from call of duty or any other FPS. Some will say ""This is such a rip off from minecraft"" when in reality, Mojang has not trademarked squares. Suprising, I know. It is not imitating minecraft for increased profit, it is not scamming roblox out of its share of fame, it is redefining fast paced combat, with minimal graphics that don't jump in your face screaming ""LOOK AT ME, THIS IS ART, NOT A GAME!"". My point being, this is combat at the core.I purchased this on sale for $5.00, and I am very pleased with it, especially since there are so many things that can and will be expanded upon.

Titan mode has 2 teams of players doing battle at the feet of giant Titans.  As the Titans do battle one will die at the hands of the other and begin to march on the fallen Titans base, fighting its way through defensive walls and turret fire.  The team being attacked must focus on killing the Titan before it reaches their base and ends the round.  If both Titans are downed the game switches momentum toward the ""creep spawn"" phase, where small NPC creatures begin to spawn around the edges of the map.  Kill the creeps to power up your Titan for the next Titan battle, keeping an eye out for the Golden Creep for extra power.The game starts you out with 6 available loadout slots, and a basic arsenal consisting of a sword, assault rifle, shotgun, sniper rifle, grenade, and deployable turret.  More weapon options open up almost immediately as you begin to play and spend currency earned in game (no pay to unlocks) to unlock and craft new weapons.  Weapons range from Titan killing giant swords to swords that heal your after a kill, to new versions of the sniper rifle and a few launcher weapons.Once you've chosen your loadout and begin the match there is still some customization and and specialization to consider.  At any time during the match you can hit the M key and open the armor crafting menu.  Each round you start out as a naked block man, completely capable of getting kills and winning the round, only without the bonuses and negative effects that come with the armor sets.  Armor bonuses range from increased Titan damage, ability to double jump, increased run speed, to increased damage and more.  Now that you've entered the match, crafted a piece of armor, and got a kill you can pick up the power orb dropped by the enemy, evolving your weapon and increasing your power until you are killed.  For example, if you are wielding the sword weapon and grab a power up orb, you are now dual wielding swords and look like a bit of a badass.  Power it up further to wield two flame covered swords and strike fear in the hearts of anyone you can sneak up behind.So, grab a load out, craft your armor, kill the enemy, power up your weapons, and defend your Titan until it's time to creep farm and make the final push on the enemy base!I'm writing this review an hour before I leave for work and I can't wait to get home and play some more."

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Spray a 9x9-inch pan with nonstick spray, then line with a strip of parchment paper so that it covers the bottom and comes up two sides of the pan. Spray the parchment with nonstick spray too.2. In a microwave safe bowl (or in the top of a double boiler or pan set on top of a pan of simmering water), microwave in 30 second bursts to melt butter and chocolate chips together until all is melted and smooth. Whisk in the sugars, then whisk in the eggs, vanilla and salt. Sift flour into the bowl and stir that in too. Scrape the brownie batter into the prepared pan. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes, or until the brownie layer is cooked through (toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean). Place the pan of brownies in the refrigerator to speed up the cooling process (or cool at room temperature and add the cookie dough layer later).Prepare the cookie dough layer:3. In a large bowl, use an electric mixer to combine the butter, sugars and salt until soft and creamy (1 to 2 minutes). Mix in the milk and vanilla. Sprinkle in the flour and mix in until combined. Stir in the 1 cup of chocolate chips. Scoop the cookie dough onto the top of the brownies and spread onto the brownie layer. I find that it's easiest to do this if the brownie layer is chilled and firm. Wet your hands or spray them with nonstick spray and pat the cookie dough on top in a even layer. Sprinkle additional chocolate chips on top to create a nicer, visual appearance. For easy, clean cutting, chill the brownies (wrap the brownies with plastic wrap and chill until firm- 1 to 2 hours or up to 2 days).4. Cut the brownies: Run a knife along the sides of the brownie pan and then use the parchment paper to lift the brownies from the pan and onto a cutting board. Slice the brownies with a sharp knife, wiping the knife with a paper towel between cuts. If you'd like all of your slices of brownies to look clean-cut without edges, use the knife to cut the sides of the brownies off before cutting pieces. Keep brownies slices covered and chilled until ready to serve."

Every games boast about their graphics... but who cares !Seriously here we have devs focused on gameplay and for an early access this is amazing !Combine 3 tenors of multiplayer games, Quake, Unreal and Dota with a Tron/ Mirror's Edge style and you have Minimum.Fast paced and violent fights. Point system: to be the best even if you're not a pro in pvp. During every match (actually in titan mode) every actions gives you points. So when you do your best to defeat the enemy Titan of destroying there defenses you will score points. I've seen players with the lowest number of kills  winning a match (400 pts with 5 kills and on the other side 200 with 16 kills).For weapons, the upgrading system is based on cubes dropped by dead ennemies. 5 levels in total, if you die you loose everything. Quite rude especially when the enemy killed all your team...Armors are really cool but respawn points are not protected so upgrading your armor means death (quite often because of spawn kill :\).The creep farming is funny, the more creeps you kill, the more powerfull your titan will be.Considering that in every titan maps the titans will fight each other (really cool to see !), this phase is very important.The longer the titans are operational, the better are the chances to destroy enemy walls .A reall y good game if you consider the minimum graphics."

A variety of weapons and equipment keep battles interesting, and some recent balance changes really go a long way toward keeping matches close and exciting. Currently, only Titan mode is playable, which involves escorting a giant beast of a machine toward the enemy base while trying to help it destroy the enemy titan, and using the down time of your respective champions to gather resources and powerups for their next activation.It's a long way to go to the finished product, I think, but the journey is probably going to be a lot of fun.

All of the weapons seem fairly balanced with nothing standing out as being overpowered, despite what some people say about some of the weapons everything has a clear counter to it.What brings me back to this game the most is the DEVS, they are constantly rolling out updates to fix everything from stability issues to adding new content, they event want to add a fun theme for Talk like a pirate day.

,Recommended,214190,12286640,"Posted: 29 September, 2014",all,Space Walrus,"This game has an amazing art style, and beautiful, dazzling effects. It's simple look might turn some people off, but the maps are surprisingly detailed and well thought out. The gameplay is very unique, something I'd describe as a MOBA-like, Third-Person Shooter/Sword Fighting, Base Defense.It's main gamemode (though there are PvE and TDM gamemodes), is called Titan. It focuses around protecting your Titan, to compare to MOBAs: Your Ancient/Nexus/Whatever Smite calls it. However, your Titan is mobile, and can beat the shampoodle out of the enemy's Titan. In the gamemode Titan there are two phases. In the first phase, your Titans attack each other, and which ever wins gets to try and destroy the defenses of the other's base. The second phase occurs when both Titans are dead. In this phase, you collect points for your Titan by killing the Creep/Minions/Whatever Smite calls them. Essentially, if you get better farming done, your Titan will be stronger in the next Titan fight. This repeats until one Titan reaches the core at the end of either base. When that happens, it's game over.The gameplay results in some extraordinary tactics and fun to be had with friends. Each map has it's own unique Titans and theme, so it's difficult to look at this game after a while and think: ""Eh, been there, done that."" And the best part of the game, is that it's still in development. They are constantly adding new things, new maps, balancing armors, etc.Overall, I'd rate this game an 8.5 out of 10. I'd certainly recommend this to any one of my friends."

76561197961096228,Recommended,214190,12239967,"Posted: 25 September, 2014",all,Xelly,"Minimum is a tough nut to draw up a suggestion.  There’s probably not much more I can add to the reviews of the various mechanics and systems in place for Minimum that other reviews haven’t provided.  Instead, I’m just going to give what I ended up liking and not liking about the whole package.I liked that the core gameplay more or less focuses on blasting an opponent, real or otherwise.  I enjoyed that the systems were simple once learned, and that there can be a fair amount of strategy implemented by player groups – a good game can be a really good experience if both teams are playing hard and implementing tactics and counters to the other team.  I like that the Armor you can use is not just for fun but can be tactically-relevant customizations given your weapon and/or the map.  Finally, I like that there seems to be some good groundwork laid out for the future, i.e. missions, upgrades, weapon levels, custom buildings (?), etc., can all lead to a fairly robust game.However, a good deal of potential only makes what I dislike about the game hurt more.  The game feels like it works against itself at times – gameplay doesn’t always reinforce the goals of each mode, for instance – and thus can lead to frustrating behavior for an otherwise team-based game.  Games snowball in one team’s favor extremely easily, and while you get no bonus for winning (or penalty for losing), getting crushed too quickly can become a deflating experience.  The weapons, while numerous, are not always so different that you need to employ different strategies to use them – you can use some shotguns like melee, and some snipers like launchers, etc.  This leads right to the next issue, which is that while the game has an acceptable grind, the grind is made not-quite-worth-it because the unlockable weapons are either uninteresting or irrelevant, short of having to be used to complete missions with.  Missions don’t cycled, and cannot be manually cycled, so you can be left with a trio of missions for weapons you don’t have (and need to grind resources for just to complete missions), or you have missions that include kills for support weapons.  Not terrible, but just not that fun, and not really something you look forward to.And, of course, as of this writing the technical aspects of the game still seem unpolished.  Missions will sometimes not be updated after a match, loading errors and game crashes can be frustrating, and some connection issues can cause rubberbanding or put you into a flipbook.  A windowed mode which doesn’t quite stretch to the edges of a window means you can click on whatever it is behind the game in a match and leave the game in the background.  When you build guns, you might end up building a gun twice with one click.The bottom line is, none of that is absolutely game-breaking, but they do add up.  This definitely has the feel of a game that could have spent a little more time polishing before release.   If don’t mind waiting for the issues to get ironed out, supplemented, added-in, or simply completed, or you don’t care about it, then Minimum is good value, especially if you ever get it on a sale.  There is potential here, and isn't so expensive if you want to hope for the best.  If you’re looking for consistent and plentiful content, Minimum is still pouring the foundation, so you'll probably want to check in later."

I do, however, like the MOBA elements thrown in. Except for the weapon leveling. The weapon leveling is an♥♥♥♥♥backwards system that only hinders those without experience (or high framerate, but maybe that's just me), and could easily be thrown out to balance the game out.Also, I asked on the forums if the devs could make a first person mode, and they replied ""Sorry, we didn't make first-person models, so no."" What? Are you serious? It's not that hard to make a separate camera in the character's head to make a first-person mode. Yes, I understand you mean models as in models that are exclusive to the first-person, but you could dazzle people and make a more realistic first-person. Not saying you have to, but it could really impress some people if you do it and polish it (Alright, pseudo-rant over)All in all, this game is essentially a TPS that throws in MOBA-like elements and upgrades, with armor crafting being on-the-fly, which is cool and all, but it's not really needed in all honesty.

Even though the katanas really need to be balanced, there needs to be more maps for all modes, and having a level 5 upgraded weapon can make some players near invincible, Minimum will most likely be updated in the near future to fix one or all of these issues. Before I forget, I do love the armor system and how you rank it up ingame by collecting. Similarly with the aforementioned weapons, they rank up ingame as well."

,Not Recommended,214190,16378833,"Posted: 13 June, 2015",all,...,"The game is very promising and very well thought out. The visual style the developers went for is appealling as well. Gameplay is intuitive and rewards players who do what they need to to win. Team killing, as I have learned through experience, will penalize you. However, those are the only reasons I am recommending the game and not refunding it immediately. The game seems to suffer from a lack of optimization. I am running a modern gaming rig, 32gigs of ram, over a terabyte of free space, nvidia drivers (all up to date and snuff), the full package, and I suffer EXTREMELY from what I can only guess is lag. Rubberbanding all over the place, misfiring grenades (which ultimately lead to a lower score, and frustrated team mates), all the while with all settings to the lowest possibly (which pretty much would ultimately leave the game looking like a turd that came from a pre-alpha build's♥♥♥♥♥hole, if it weren't for the fact that would be pretty close to the truth.) It is almost pathetic to think that games I can play (I.E Warframe, Skyrim, LoL) that are cranked up to the max, some with graphic mods, and this game, which has no textures to speak of, no real graphics, somehow undoes the very fabric of the computer itself.Communication ingame seems rather limited. Players don't seem to communicate, if at all. Text-chat was barren first 3 games I played, and I have no idea if there is even a Voice chat, team chat, etc.The game's tutorial guides you through one type of game mode, titan battle, which is pretty much the main attraction to the game, as it was featured in it's title. Despite being, you know, giant behemoths of polygons, these things are pretty brainless to the players in general. To an extent, I feel like it is a glorified version of payload from TF2, which is weird because of the many differences between the two, but the end goals are almost the same. Object A goes to point B where you win. However, the way to reach that objective is much different and certainly interesting and fun. (Probably the worst analogy ever, so just go play through the tutorial or watch a video of it on youtube, and you'll kind of get what I mean, eh?)there are two other modes, team death match (Self-explanatory) and horde mode. It would have been really nice if horde-mode had a tutorial, so I know what I am doing and how it goes, but once you die the first time in it, you pretty much know what is going on. BUT for those who want salvation from that frustrating surprise, its you and 4 others against enemy Ai cosplaying as if it were halloween. Also dinosaurs are in it. Basically, ""how long can you last?"".Gameplay wise, the game is great. Unfortunately, there are some issues. One design flaw I noticed was that when you kill enemy players, they drop parts and pieces to make you more bad♥♥♥♥♥then before. Sadly, anyone can pick up these pieces. I wouldn't mind this, but there are a few issues here, such as players who are utterly useless (LIKE ME) following other players who are decent and can somehow run the game killing enemies, and stealing their hard-earned buffs. Obviously, jokes aside, this is a problem. One idiotic leech can turn the tide of an entire game from winning to losing in a couple of seconds just by dying. However, the beauty of this, which I am guessing the devs were going for (right?) was that ENEMIES can pick up the fallen bits and become buffed themselves. This is a good strategy, as it means you will always be moving, and it does allow planning by both sides during the game.There is item purchasing in this game, though it is done through in-game currency. From what I can tell, no pay2win scrublords (Although I could be grossly mistaken. I only got to play 3 games total after all.) Guns are pretty much run of the mill, though they make a difference, and using them properly is crucial (Protip, grenade launchers hurt you and your allies. I found that out by killing a friendly turret and player by rubberband accident.)The game is good, but I feel like it needs more to it for it to thrive. It's great fun now, but play a few matches over a couple of days, and that steam will run out. With only three game modes total, the game could definitely use a bit more diversity to it, even if it was something like Capture the flag (Which would be fun as hell in this game). Deathmatch (Battle free royale, not team deathmatch) would also be cool, to see who is the most minimal in that lobby. Private matches are possible, which is nice touch, but again, with only so many modes possible, it's tough to say how long this game will last.The game is great, the art style so simplistic it'll ♥♥♥♥ your computer right up it's cooling unit so it can't even play the game, audio and announcer are great (They are frequent, but not enough for you to pull out your hair like in other games), and playing it just feels right. Until your computer offs and screws you with bad framerate. The game has been out for almost a year now and this game feels unpolished in certain regards, though, which leaves me tough to review positively or negatively. Also, there's a reason why it's 10$ I'm sure. Not that I am complaining. (4$ summer sale)I think that if you are in the mood for a shooter, thismightbe a game for you. But like I said, if those laggy-framerate issues on your bad♥♥♥♥♥rig can't be contained, you might just want to steer clear from this, or request a refund. The fruit on top is titan mode, and it's definitely good fun if you can run it smoothly.If you have the time and cash, give the game a shot and if you like it keep it, and if not, then refund it.TL;DR : Game seems unoptimized, has been out for a year, only 3 game modes, one short tutorial for one mode, cool art style, greephix are good. framerate issues rubberbanding fun times to lag. GG WP NO RE. Katana users automatically win with rubberbanding assissting them.EDIT: I am not recommending the game yet, due to the lag issues with servers. However, I feel that if people support the game it could become better. Or rather yet, wait for it's Sequel Maximum (IDEK I guess it'll be good...?) to come out and for this one to become free."

Especially when there is an armor that increases this factor with every level.-The armor crafted is way too resilient in comparison to damage dealing-The targeting hub for most of the weapons is completly off. When playing with the Cryo Sniper or the basic assault rifle, it would immediately fire above the aim reticle.-The sword is incredibly overpowered with melee-based armor equipped.- The rate in which unlocks and rewards are presented is basically slim to none, which is really in poor taste to me. You have to give something more substantial than just resources through 10-50 matches until you get something actually worth the cheap force of punishment.-The arenas and gameplay modes, while fun, are still incredibly limited based on function and variety."

I'm even down for the cheap cop out on the visuals. You know, make a game called ""Minimum"" and make everything cheap and flat as possible. Saves a ton of work on their end. It's cheap, but hey, long as its fun right?I was happy to see on the Steam Front Page where it said under the picture for Minimum ""End of Early Access!"" which I thought would mean a finished product. Something that doesn't seem to happen too much nowadays because everything is Early Access or Beta. Well ... silly me. Opened the game up and instantly started seeing things that said ""Coming Soon!"" or ""We're working on this at the moment!"" and so forth and so on. Remember when they made games and finished them?But ... all that is a whole other argument. This game is horribly unbalanced and needs some work. Some things are just painfully obvious, like the whole getting powerup drops from the guy you kill. Simple right? Well, what if you're shooting him, then some♥♥♥♥♥on your team with swords runs up to either get the finishing blow or just happens to be next to the bad guy when he dies. Guess who gets all the powerups? Not the sniper, that's for sure. Or the guy with any gun for that matter.And of course there is lag issues. I can empty a clip on a guy and he doesn't die, then two shots from him on my fully armored character and I give up the ghost. Then next minute it will be the other way around. Saw some guys bickering earlier about how he was chopping dude for a good minute with his swords and he never died.Really, in the end, it's just like 90% of the other games these days.

Please note, if I appear harsh or spiteful, I want the game to be fun and hope that this is taken as constructive critisism, and this review is susceptible to change as the game's life progresses and if the devs make necessary changes.1. Not completed, far from it.2. Paywalls, for guns, armor, asthetics, you name it.3. Unbalanced gameplay4. Gameplay itself is poor5. Very quickly gets repetitive6. Progression for someone who doesn't pay cash to get guns is ridiculously slow.7. Devs prefer to have more items available for you to buy than having completed features.So, to begin with, the game simply is not completed. It has an absolute plethora of features- Except you can't access them. About 1/20 of the features are actually there, from things such as crafting, upgrading, or in general, unlocking items. This also ties into reason number 7, where despite these features being unavailable, they STILL have more items for you to buy with cash than they do items you can unlock naturally. This is something that would be expected from a game in need of funding i.e. a F2P game, not a 10 dollar game at full price.Next up, gameplay. The gameplay, put simply, can have a winning team be determined within the first minutes of deathmatch, the first hour of titan mode, and the co-op of course doesn't apply here. The way the game works is by getting a kill, or picking up a ""powerup"" when dropped by an enemy or a turret of theirs, the weapon equipped increases in power. However, when you die, that weapon's level is reset when you respawn. The devs have ""fixed"" this by making the primary weapon start off with three levels in the late game. This is inherently flawed, since the team who gets luckier first has players that are constantly capped out with max weapons that dominate everyone, even with the minor boost that you're given since the level 5 of every weapon is just God Mode. The most common retort to this is, ""Well, you keep your armor, so it's fine."" In truth, your armor makes little to no difference in combat when there's some guy with a sword that can kill you with two hits, with or without the armor.This happens in deathmatch and titan mode, the only difference is that one just takes longer to end.When the I say the gameplay is poor, I'm referencing certain mechanics and design desicions. When taking damage, the only indicator you have is when your character begins to glow, and there's a soft hum. This is an absolute pain in the♥♥♥♥♥when in a huge firefight with particles everywhere that are the same color as the character's glow. You often find yourself dead without ever noticing that you were taking any major damage to begin with, and have to restart your progression of weaponry. This especially hurts the game because this isn't just getting unlucky, this happens with a 50/50 chance depending on if your team is winning or not. Having to deal with this constantly is absolutely one of the game's biggest killjoys, especially when you see some guy with a set of armor and weapons that you can't get without spending anther 10 bucks or so.The final reason for this game's bad impression on me is because one of it's arguably most important reasons, for me at least. In the game, I've reached level six, and I have only managed to craft one, count em, ONE gun. This is a huge pain for me personally, because even if guns could be bought with money, it would still be somewhat fair if the average player could obtain those as well through natural progression, and without needing to spend a few hours for one gun. The game would be so much more balanced with just a simple fix, and yet its quality suffers because of the direction the developers seem to want to take the game. It isn't impossible to have microtransactions in a balanced game, but the way it's being promoted in this game is just horrible and is hurting the experience as opposed to helping it get players caught up."

Currently only one mode is available for play.Titan Mode which consists of two teams farming creeps in phases to power up their team's Titan. Eventually the Titans will be released where they will duke it out in the middle of the map. You can damage the enemy's Titan which makes things interesting.Killing other players allows you to upgrade your weapons which makes killing so much more fun and quicker. You can craft and wield armor ingame for use in that match. Each armor piece has Pros and Cons, some allow you have more Health, but you move slower. Some allow you to deal more melee damage but you have less health.There are blue prints to be unlocked which will allow you access to more Guns and Armor. The game has a few bugs which is to be expected. It may take a few times hitting ""Play"" to actually get into a game. I had an experience when I clicked on Craft ""section where you can unlock weapons and armor"" and the game actually crashed to my desktop. At that point I was like well.. it's time to play something else...From what I understand this game will become F2P, you are merely paying for Early Access.

Even with the best items in the game you still get owned by noobs, so it's balanced to player ability.  Crafting is cool.  Hope to see a lot more items for customization;  however, minimalism is the point here, so it's also nice that the game is SO clean.  It's very easy to tell what is what and who to shoot.  The distraction of the Giant Mechs is welcome, slowing the viciousness of the FPS pacing to a more relaxed (yet vigorous) MOBA speed, as the players must escort them.  The hunting of creeps to power up Titans is also a fun distraction.  It's nice that all player styles have oppertunities to shine.  Turrets could be better for defense.  Also, I get crashes and kicks, but the dev team is dilligently working to solve those issues.  I really enjoy the katanas.  There is nothing quite like bulding up a speed+ set, running through gunfire, & decapitating another robot just because you can.  Melee really shines.

Although there are signs of weekly builds it seems that there isn't any development happening here on more serious issues. One example is that the game allows you to end up with an invalid loadout that prevents you from joining servers and with no way to correct the problem the game literally becomes a brick. You cannot play it.This is not an early access game but is certainly incomplete and buggy. Don't waste your money on this, go play Gear Up instead for your robotic arena fix."

It was fun, it was fast, and I had an abosulte blast playing it.That was about four or five months ago. I had taken a break from it to play some other games that I had gotten. After a couple of months, I had decided to revisit Minimum, to play a game I had actually enjoyed.Boy, oh boy, was I in for a rude awakening.The very first match I played ended with the whole enemy team having fully upgraded weapons and armor, while we were struggling to even power up our Titans. I was salty, and I was sad to see that my playstyle from the early days of the game didn't work anymore.I played five more games. The same thing happened: Enemy team got powered up completely, using high power weaponry (nothing but that, I might add), and fully upgraded armor. My team was getting slaughtered just walking out of spawn. This went on for all five matches.In a salt-fueled rage, I hard-shut the game window, and uninstalled Minimum.That was maybe three months back. Now, seeing Minimum's grayed-out name in my library, I'm reminded of how I used to like it. It also reminded me that I needed to edit my review. So, here's that.If you are seriously considering getting this game, be warned: It will chew you up, digest you, $#!t you out, and repeat the whole cycle again and again until you do one of two things: You either give in and stoop down to your enemies' level and use heavy firepower to dominate your opponents, or you make the sanest decision you will ever make and uninstall the game.The decision is yours, friend."

I bought it quite a while back but just now ready to jump in and start having fun each weekend. I'm going to give it a thumbs up only because the game itself is great. It's rare that you jump into a game now days and immediately start having fun. There were only a few real players and the rest were bots but the gameplay itself is great. Easy to control, smooth, great visual style. Frame rates were suspect at times even on my 980ti. Not sure if it's not optimized well or what. Thumbs up to the game, but it's probably not worth buying for anyone else considering it. I've heard the publisher bailed on the game even though the devs were willing to move forward. $10 for a game you will jump into and play with bots most of the time, a few humans here and there, when bored? You decide. I don't know if it's possible to host your own games and have all your friends join, but if you had enough friends to do that and it was possible to host, would be worth it."

If the game still counter as early access, I wouldn't be so harsh, but the way it is the game is simply boring. The interface is anti-intuitive. The important information are in the little icons top-left of the main menu. The game grants you with somewhat useless patch note ""news"" from months ago. Any game played require the use of the server list, which then connects you to the game. (works but clunky) You can't access crafting menu between matches, you need to leave the server then reconnect.So how is the game? you might ask... Well it's slow paced and everything feels a bit sluggish. I don't mean laggy, just unimpressive. You get upgrades when you kill opponents, but the upgrades don't feel like they are worth much. Everytime you die you lose the upgrades, but it never felt to me like I lost anything, nor did I ever feel like I needed to play safe so the opponent wouldn't get my ""worthy"" death. Katanas are very important in the game and very powerful, but a katana vs katana fight pretty much only means smashing the attack button while turning in a circle.Game would be worth 2.50$ , I got it for 3$ and I don't feel like I got what I paid for. I would not recommend buying this unless there is a 80% sale on it."

,Not Recommended,214190,12100773,"Posted: 14 September, 2014",all,Jakkar,"A nice little idea spoiled by poor netcode at this stage in development. Most rounds will be dominated by a single player who is effectively immune to damage and capable of scoring one-hit kills in melee from ten to fifteen feet in range, and can warp through other players. For a game with such a strong emphasis on close combat, the disparity between melee hit-detection/collision-detection and the sharp (though unresponsive) gunplay is unforgiveable.I'd hope they can resolve this, but with the history of melee in arena multiplayer games, I find myself without optimism.As for the gunplay... Weapons make the faintest, most boring noises, sometimes seeming almost completely silent in battle, removing any sense of impact, or any real clue of your own fire-rate. A stylised game like this needs intense audio - but the music is dull and the sense of whether you're doing/taking damage simply isn't there.Meanwhile the amount of damage required to actually finish a player off seems significantly too high for the style of gameplay on offer - or perhaps it's simply the lack of damage feedback and poor hit-detection making it seem that way?"

Combat is also quite one sided when it comes to a sword vs a gun, swords will mostly come off the battle on the winning side. Sometimes in games, the map won't render or something will happen and so there'll be a white fog, making it impossible to play as you're unable to see three meters in front of you making it very difficult to kill someone, although it appears it only happens to a few people every now and again. There are also a ton of micro transactions with armour and weapons, although they may not change much, if any of the gameplay, I've still never been a fan of the idea of paying money for weapon/armour skins. Going back to the servers, they are feeling quite empty and will leave you waiting ages to get into a game with people in it and half the time it won't even connect and will just take you back to the home screen.If you really want to get this game, then get it although I must warn you, it'll leave you unsatisfied and wanting your money back, if you disagree with this review or want to add more to it with problems you've had, then feel free to comment on it and I'll be happy to respond to it."

The movement, gun damage, balancing, and weapon variation bring my mind to want to say that it sort of reminds me of a third person halo.I was pleasantly surprised to find out that all weapons have an alternate attack or ability as well as the armor having various passive boosts that enable you to create your own class that fits your play style.The games simplicity, balance, and ease to pick up and get going make this one of my favorite games to play right now."

,Recommended,214190,16577742,"Posted: 21 June, 2015",all,niss,"So, I've played Minimum for a while, not too long, but long enoguh to make a good review of the game.MInimum is a graphicly minimalistic, yet somehow beautiful, third person MOBA styled shooter that is full of creativity, fun and good times.Whilst it doesn't have huge detail for it's textures, MInimum is a good looking game, and runs superbly, even when recording. I would compare it's FPS performance as similar to that of TF2 or CS:GO, which are both made by the huge company Valve.You can collect materials in game which allow you to make Weapon and Item Schematics, which allow you to buy weapons and make your own custom loadouts. There are shotguns, assault rifles, burst fire rifles, sniper rifles, laser guns and more.Your character can also be either male or female.There are three gamemodes, though you'll probably only play two: Team Dethmatch and Titan mode.TDM is quite self-explanatory as I'm sure everyone knows how THAT gamemode works.Titan mode however, is interesting: You fight enemies as usual, and kill creeps to collect powerups. Then, a giant computer controlled robot/monster forms for each team, and the one with the most powerups wins. Then, the winning titan destroys walls in a path to the other teams base, which it will then proceed to destroy. This takes time, though, and often the other team will kill the opposing titan, and the battle continues.There is quite a lot of depth to Minimum, and it is a very enjoyable game that I didn't really play until the last week, despite having it quite a long time before the Summer Sale happened.My rating for minimum: 8.5/10, could use some more maps, weaponry and gamemodes."
76561198054536841,Recommended,214190,16560999,"Posted: 20 June, 2015",all,Whrithlin,"Minimum is great. Even though the graphics are designed to be as simple as possible, the game is extremely pretty. I have yet to have any connection issues, and everything is fast and responsive.The main game mode is really the only thing I've played as of yet (since the other option is Team Deathmatch, and, gross) - if you're familiar with Soul Wars from RuneScape, it's close to the same style as that. The objective is to kill the other teams' titan, so that yours can walk up and destroy their base.Overall, it seems that all of the weapons are generally balanced. There are a lot of reviews that claim otherwise, but that is because of the 'snowball' effect that's potent in this game - the more kills you get, the more you power up your weapons. It's an interesting idea, and seems to effect all weapons equally (except maybe sniper rifles, because it's hard to retrieve your loot, but they're decent even without a power-up.) Melee does do a TON of damage, but the only real way to make it viable is to sneak up on your opponent or to stack up as much speed from your armor that's physically possible - because if you're paying attention, there are multiple movement abilities put on weapons throughout the game and you can walk backwards at the same rate as walking forward (which I personally like) - and force them to switch weapons in order to hit you.There are a few glitches that forces me to lower my rating - but none of it really affects gameplay. There a few (3-5) instances of objects existing where they really don't, and the interface can accidentally cover your tutorial and there's no way to close it, and sometimes your bullets DO get confused and look like they're flying the wrong way, but hey, whose don't?This is a fresh new version of a fps - it's faced-paced and interesting. I'd recommend to my friends 8/10"

Nothing more complex than that, such as proper Medic classes, stealth roles, instakill abilities, diving and wall running. None of that BS that makes you wanna rage. Not even snipers can one-shot you, you'll have plenty of time to take cover should you get attack by one.As each match progresses, player upgrade their weapons and abilities so classes stand out a bit more towards the end. This is the only game I ever get kill-streaks at a frequent rate in. Plus witnessing 2 giant robots punch each other up in the middle of a warzone is bloody badarseThe interfaces are pretty glitchy and laggy though. That needs A LOT of work.

Since you have two primary weapon slots and a device slot you can mix and match your classes. Then there's the armor you choose to wear every match which makes a big difference on how you move and stats. The game play is really solid. The only problem right now is you have to be careful on edges of objects in the game or you will get caught up on invisible walls. It's not bad enough to stop you from going 50 and 0 but you wish it wasn't there.I hope more people pick this game up because it's pretty fun. Keep in mind that if someone on the scoreboard has a ping of 0 that means it's a bot. Yes the game fills empty slots in this 5v5 with bots. I didn't realize that at first and was wondering why it was so easy to♥♥♥♥♥♥on the enemy team. Alot of the time it's rooms with at least most of the 10 slots being filled with players.It's a good game and even at regular price you should try it out.

It's so straight forward, yet great fun and has some depth. No cover system, no slides or anything silly. Run, gun, crouch, jump and kill, rinse and repeat. Oh, and defend Giant robots when you want. I have not been in a match that was not fun.Pro :Quick, fast action with great level layouts. Not enough maps really, but enough to have fun. As an Ex Quake series player I'm immediately drawn to it.Great progression system ( Dual, so unlocking guns/armour for levels, but building armour is done in game! )Good gun play. If you can shoot straight, you're going to do well. Slower more powerful guns are rewarding if you can get the timing right.Powerup on each of your two gun load outs based on player kills ( great idea). Changes the play style as you go.Frost and fire elemental damage is interesting and annoying if you get hit by it :)Flaming Dual weilding swords. Seriously fun.Con:Crashes a bit. And sadly it crashes in a way I'm unable to close and return to desktop ( can't get Task Manager to show as the main desktop area is blocked from display, so can't close process.). Signout of Windows (Win8 64) is the only solve, or reboot.Matchmaking sometimes returns me to the main menu (even after a loading screen), in a state which is obviously broken ( mission lists are blank or gibberish ). Joining a game from then will crash me. Quit and restart. Sometimes this is not solveable, so I wait for a while.

The game is not completed, but the content is there to put at least 15 - 20 hours before exausting all new content. The majority of the content is going to be unlocking those weapons and armor variations. While there are 'microtransactions' they are for skins and not for weapons ie. they function the same, just look better. Now while I am hugely against these 'meta'game transactions, this is not as bad because you cant buy the materials needed to craft new weapons and have a competitve edge at a low level. The game plays like a twitch shooter and the 3 gamemodes are fun and different from eachother.   The titan gamemode is probably going to be everyones first match, and while its good, its not as good as the team deathmatch mode. TDM in this game just works very well, the longer you stay alive, the more powerfull your guns, and once you die you have to regain those upgrades.Overall the game has decent content/ although it has many greyed out options in the crafting menu, I hope they do follow through and add the content because that would make this game trury worth the money, right now though its enough content that if you like the idea, buy it, if you dont like the idea, dont bother."

,Recommended,214190,12073834,"Posted: 12 September, 2014",all,Christopher,"Minimum is a third-person arena based shooter with a minimalist art style and solid gameplay. As of the time of this writing (9/12/2014) I can say that the gameplay is rock solid while the content is yet to be fully fleshed out. I'll try to keep this review from repeating anything you can learn on the store page and stick to the technical details.The GoodNetcode:The netcode it superb. Hit-detection is client-side, so if you shot something, it *really* is shot. No lag shields here. In fact, rarely have I ever encountered the ill effects of lag at all. Also, VOIP is integrated and works flawlessly.Gameplay:Rock. Solid. Simple as that. Weapon choices are balanced, a variety of armor pieces make for significant customization tailored to your playstyle, and three gameplay modes means you'll have a tough time getting bored. As a side note, I can see this becoming one of the classic 'must have' LAN games.Graphics:The graphical fidelity of this game is suprisingly high, given the art style. Yet, even though I am running the game on a potato, I am still able to get 60-80 FPS by cranking down the visual options. If you have a decent system, expect to be wowed. If not, have no fear as you can still enjoy the game. Also, FOV slider in the options menu! Huzzah!Input:Minimum is set up by default as a standard WASD shooter, but has all of the options for controller play as well. If you happen to need the extra help, aim assist is available. Also, completely rebindable keys.Tutorial:A quick and sensible tutorial teaches you everything you need to know without extensive drawn out voice-overs or millions of text boxes. All of the core mechanics are covered.The Bad (?)Content:Minimum is missing content. As you move through the UI, be prepared to see ""Coming Soon!"" rather often. You'll be waiting on Ranked Games, being able to host a dedicated server, making upgrades to deployables or structures, and Steam Workshop for user generated content.F2P Trappings/In-game Purchases:This is in part due to the title's development history. Originally intended as a F2P title, the game changed hands mid-cycle. The current developers chose to release the title as a one time paid model, but the trappings of the F2P history can still be found. There is an ingame store, albeit only for cosmetic items.VerdictAs with all good games, Minimum's core mechanics are easy to learn and difficult to master. Clearly this is a game made by gamers for gamers. The developers are constantly in touch with the player base and I expect they will follow up on everything they say they will.  Although essentially a multiplayer only game (there are bots, but it's not the same) the addition of dedicated servers means that even if the game goes belly up you'll still be able to play with your friends.If you are particularly jaded, wait to see that all of the promises are fulfilled by the developers. Otherwise, I heartily recommend Minimum to anyone."

At the start, it only had two maps and Titan mode to play on, and Team Deathmatch eventually. Even then, the game never stopped being entertaining.Now that Minimum's out of early access, there's a bunch of polished maps, Horde mode, and many new armors and weapons available. I highly suggest buying this game for the low price it's available at currently (I paid $20 originally and do not regret it), ESPECIALLY if you like MOBA's or shooters. Even if you're not a big fan of shooters, the melee (swords) in this game offers another avenue of combat that's fast-paced and really fun.There are NO microtransactions, so no one player has advantage over all. This game rewards heavily on skill and teamwork, but you can just as easily go about the map lone wolf with some katanas. I've NEVER experienced problems with queueing for a lobby, the longest I've EVER had to wait was about 1 minute. This game is well worth the $10 ($5 until Sept. 17) it's decreased to.

All someone has to do is right click and then hold left; within 4 seconds that target is dead. The guns in the game do no damage compared to the swords. I understand the point of view that ""well you have to be close to the person"", but the secondary ability (the dash) allows the sword weilder to almost immediately dash right next to the target. It gets worse. As you get kill the sword becomes even more OP and you die even faster.

The art style and music are wonderful, and the in-game systems, a blend of FPS and MOBA, are satisfying. Your weapons level up and become more powerful as you pick up drops from fallen enemies (or comrades - a mad rush to pick up all the drops makes things interesting in the middle of the map!), with more interesting effects than just greater damage - the ""Bullet Hell"" assualt rifle starts to fire out a wide spread of bullets, the sniper rifle blasts and area with movement-slowing ice. This is balanced by the fact these upgrades are lost upon dying, which sounds frustrating, but you're back into things so fast you'll soon be working on leveling that weapon back up. Armour upgrades are persistent throughout the match, and as everyone chooses different combinations of head, leg and chest armour, you start recognising the different players you've been encountering throughout. You'll see that dual-sword wielding guy with the berserker helmet and remember him from the last time he rushed you down. All the systems and art style combine to make this a satisfying game to jump in and out of for an hour here and there. Do check it out!"

Would be nice to have pistol's as a weapon thinking 3, 1 standard medium-fast paced pistol with low-med daamge with upgrades with secondary maybe a speed increase (not a lunge),  a revolver slow but high damage with a secondary being a speed reload (more of a skill weapon?) , and then a laser pistol medium speed, medium dmg with secondary fire being a power shot. feel free to add or subtract ideas but please have some reasoning."

,Recommended,214190,12124034,"Posted: 16 September, 2014",all,Ecks Dee,"Minimum is a very interesting game, it's a 3rd person shooter, if you play something like Team Deathmatch, it's nothing too special.To truely understand this game, you need to play Titan mode.In Titan mode, each team has a Titan at the start of a round, your goal is to guide the titan and guard it from the other team's titan to destroy the enemy core.  (BTW, the titans are AI that follow a set path).  If both titans get destroyed, it goes into the creep stage.  Here, you farm small harmless ai called creeps.  When you kill them, they drop an item which increases your titan's power in the next mode.  This goes on for about 2-3 minutes, and then it's titans fighting again.  But if your team gets more power than the enemy team, you have an advantage.  You continue this process until one team wins.Now what's interesting is the weapons and armor.  Whenever you kill a creep, player, or titan, they drop armor points.  You can pick these up.  In the beginning once you get 10, you can get either a helmet, chestplate, or leggings.  These help your defense against the enemy team.  (You start with 10 pieces in the beginning, so you can have atleast one armor piece) Later on, you can upgrade your armor, which requires crystals found randomly on the map. You keep armor and armor points if you die.The weapons have a rank system, everytime you get a kill, you get the next weapon upgrade.  It's goes to weapon level 5.  This increases your weapon damage, firerate, and enhances it in other ways.  but if you die, you go to weapon level 1.Your guns also have special abilities when you right click.  The assault rifle shoots 7-8 bullets in less than a second, shotgun gives you a high jump, swords give you a dash.Pros:-Unique concept-Nice minimalistic graphics-Good weapon selection (rifles, shotguns, even swords)-Fun, hard to get bored ofCons:-Weapon balance issues (Swords OP, shotgun takes 2-3 shots at point blank range even at weapon level 5)In my opinion, it doesn't feel like it should be out of early access, as it's still got some bugs and problems to be resolved.Overall, it's great fun, especially if you get it when it's $5, but still has a few problems."

The problem is that it's very much an unfinished game and the developers are outright lying when releasing this as a complete product and saying it's out of early access. This game won't be in a good state for another couple of months. It's lacking features, it's lacking polish and it shows. If you get this game despite it's problems, here are a few things you can expect happen to you.- The game sometime crashes on launch- The game crashes when exiting the game- The game drops you frequently from servers, despite <50 ping- There's a lot of bugs with sounds. Missing sounds on weapons. Sounds sometimes not playing.- Problem with rubberbanding, hit detection, collision detection. Get used to getting killed around corners or seeing your character get teleported around the screen.- Missing tooltips or tooltips that say one thing and does something else.- A whole bunch of useless items to unlock. Expect around half of the items you unlock  to be completely useless. The rest may be awesome though, so roll a dice and hope for the best.With all that said though, I've still had some fun, so if you are starving for a  fast paced shooter, it may be worth it, just be aware of what you're getting in to."

As I've stated before, it's very addicting game. It's that way because, like the game title says, It's pretty much mininum graphicwise... Everything is all solid colors and cubic. That way you can fully focus on the gameplay 100% rather than graphic like 99.99% of games nowadays. The gameplay is pretty fun, you get to play one of three game modes- Deathmatch, Titan, and Horde. I'll not divulge on what those modes are, you'll have to play this exciting and fast paced game to find out!"

The concept, although a mix of what we have seen, is new and fresh and really enjoyable, and the gameplay is very smooth and crisp. BUT it also has a lot of minor issues that hopefully will get fixed, like connectivity, optimizability, and balancing issues. For example, the guns need some balancing, as the launchers and swords are WAY more OP than the rifle and shotgun (I hate them sword-wielding non-killable guys T.T).

The controls are great, the movement is fluid and the graphics are extremely pleasant to look at. But there are some HUGE problems atm. Firstly, a game based on items and that you have to pay to play should NOT offer items that you HAVE to pay more money to use, and that are so incredible over powered. The swords in this game already make it completely unbalanced for PVP, and on top of the fact that the best sword is one you have to PAY for is incredible saddening. Secondly, you can buy armor with real money in this game, and it has no downsides. To put it into perspective, in game armor you can earn gives you roughly 10% buff and -10% debuff(dmg vs health, speed vs dmg etc). If you pay $1.50 you can get armor that at the first level gives you 25% EXTRA DMG WITH NO DOWNSIDE. The only reason I bothered to write this review is because the engine of this game is so smooth and fun to play, but if someone on the other team decided to pay $5 over you, you WILL be at a significant disadvantage."

76561198045988554,Recommended,214190,12067489,"Posted: 11 September, 2014",all,Just A Hapless Trooper,"Minimum, the American game company Atari throws its hat back into the ring, after years of silence. And, you know what, they came back in a good way, Minimum is a great game with interesting mechanics, and right now is the best time to get it, it's dirt cheap, I got it back when it still cost twenty, but now, the price won't burn a hole in your wallet, and for a game like this, it's best to get it while it doesn't cost too much.So let's dive into the gameplay, Minimum, at first, seems like your everyday third person shooter, and it plays very similar. However, the mechanics of the game, are what seperate it from, let's say Gears Of War. The game features a blueprint crafting system, meaning you gather resources (simply by playing and leveling up), to later use to assemble new weapons and armor, there is NO pay to win here (though there are armor and weapon types that you can purchase, but it's not necessarily somehting that gives you more of an edge, it's more for show). Now, these weapons and armor, can be leveled up in game, armor you level up by collecting purple and black armor shards (black shards are also used to create the level one armor set) and you level up your weapon by killing enemies or destroying enemy equipment. Each weapon and armor set has unique properties, such as the samurai helmet, which boosts your melee damage, and the speedy shotgun, which grants the player the gift of a much faster running speed. Armor parts are crafted into 3 sets, legs, torso, and head, and you don't need to craft all of the same type, it's actually best to mix it up. Such as, using olympian legs, which grant you a fster running speed, with a ninja chesplate, which will allow you to recharge your health faster after killing an enemy, and the beserker helmet, which grants you a higher damage rate.So, next, is the game modes, of which there are 3. Now, I know what you're thinking, only three? That must get old real quick. Actually, no, the game modes are all engrossing, especially the titan game mode. The first game mode is TDM, which is pretty self explanatory, but it's interesting because of all the armor combos, and the weapons are all interesting to use. The next game mode is Horde, which again, is pretty self explanatory, but there is a variety in enemies, ninjas, samurais, dinosaurs, astronauts, knights, this makes for a fun survival game mode. Lastly, the game's most hyped game mode, titan game mode. This game mode, is played by two teams powering up their titans, to destroy defensive walls (titans and walls, hah). This is done by killing creeps. BUt now I know what you're thinking, this is just like a moba isn't it? Well, yes and no, the game mode is like a moba, but it plays like a third person shooter, and you don't need to buy a ton of specific stuff and play a millon tutorials to understand it, it's simplistic, and fun, it's a moba without the complexity, but instead, giant robots that beat the hell out of eachother.Lastly, even though it's not really the most important part of the game, it's still a part of it, the graphics. The game's minimalistic style (hence the name, minimum) gives the game charm, they aren't the pixelated blocks of Minecraft, but instead smooth blocks, which give the game an interesting look, and I don't think you need a fast pc to run this one, though it still looks great in my opinion.So, overall, I feel Atari has made a solid comeback here, interesting mechanics, fun game modes, and charming graphics, and it's on sale right now, as a celebration that it's officially off early access (so all of you that are early access wary, put your qualms to rest, this game is no longer in the development stages)Rating: 9/10"

This is definetly not finished.The design:It looks great, the minimalist approach is very pleasing and makes me feel like I'm battling using legos, a good thing as far as I'm concerned :)The different level designs are diverse and nice to play in, vibrant and fun.A bit more customisation would be great though, colours, shapes or other visual effects without game effects, only making you look different.After a few matches you can choose some specific armour bits, aimed at your playstyle, most of them looking the part.The game itself:Potentially this could be great, especially the game-mode with the titans. However:Controls:Everything feels slowish, not as streamlined as a shooter should. Somehow the controls feel a bit sluggish, can't put my finger on why.Gameplay:The winner takes all, again and again and again.... This doesnt work very well. Shoot a few guys and upgrade your weapons and it gets ever easier to kill the other guys.... those guys that you allready demolished several times over. They lose their upgrades every time you kill them, making you (the winner) stronger and keeping them (the loser) weak. After a while it gets rather easy to kill the others because of this. I feel there should be something to even the odds, because once you lose, it's generally a downward spiral.Not much fun for the losing guys, but not much of a challenge for the winning team either.Bugs:Quite often you will ""jump"" back and forth, putting you back in the smae spot several times. Seems laggy, but there is no connection spike, really weird.The moneygrab:The options to simply buy ""skins"" (stff that makes you better armed and armoured) is a cheap ploy though, making this a pay to win unfortunately.In my book this brings the game down about a million nothces unfortunately.Do I recommend it? For the few bucks it costs, yes. But only just; if the developers put some effort in this could be a great game.

The game no longer has consistant crashes, AND I dont teleport any more (Which wasnt my internet btw). Really the only thing I can complain about is that there arent team specific creep zones, and that the homing plasma launcher no longer homes. Technically the second complaint is an improvement seeing as how Overpowered the Homing plasma launcherused to be. Also they've added more weapons and armor. This is a huge improvement!

Very unique and to me has a ton of replay value for only playing for a short period. The leveling system has 2 different routes. One being in game and temporary in which you get levels for your weapon by getting kills with them and the other by collecting resources and buying new armor sets to help defend yourself. The other route is out of game though again resources collected after the game and XP. These give you permanent upgrades and allow you to build new weapons.

Don't get me wrong, I expect issues with early releases, but I'd like to think the developers would get some of the more basic, fundamental parts of their game to be more functional before letting the players get their hands on it. The game often crashes when trying to quit using the exit game button, and don't expect to craft and try out alot of different weapons in any reasonable amount of time, as the game eventually decides that you shouldn't get what you need to craft the different weapons in the game (Which there are quite a few of, all with their own unique perks.)There are only 3 gamemodes to play in the game: Horde, Titan, and Team Death Match (TDM). TDM is what you expect, and quite entertaining, but alot of people complain about the spawns, and for good reason. Other than Titan mode, there is no set spawn point for your team, so you may just be spawning to your doom (Although the developers did put in penalties for killing fresh spawns, that's not really going to improve your experience).Titan mode is the staple of the game, seeing as how its part of their title screen. This mode involves two massive bots going at it, and its up to you and your team to see it safely to the enemy team's home base. No problems with this mode, its quite entertaining.Last up is Horde mode, where you and a bunch of your team members fight off against hordes of astronauts, ninjas, velociraptors, etc. Don't be fooled though, they might start off dumb and relatively easy to kill at the start, but they grow hard very quicklly. This mode needs more armor resources to drop off more creeps, as without the extra protection the later waves will destroy you quickly unless you have a fully organized team of pals to watch your back, but I will admit its very fun to try surviving the unrelenting hordes that turn almost any strategy you can come up with against you.This game also has many features yet to be fully implemented (as expected, its a early release!) which I feel will make the game feel much more rewarding. Do I enjoy this game? Yes. Do I recommend it in its current form? No. I suggest you hold on for awhile and wait to see if this game's developers get on the ball with fixing its bugs."

It sounded really cool, but all you do is pick up resources from killing enemies, then clicking a button and ta-da! you've created your armor.Perhaps the game will be a lot more interesting in the future, but at it's current state it's not really worth the 5$, unless you're an avid fan of Call of Duty, where you stand doing the same thing over and over and over again, prestige, then repeat.Then yea, you may actually enjoy this game.TL;DRScore out of 10?

There are three multiplayer modes and I've only played Team Deathmatch so far, but it's very addictive.  The pace is very fast, like Quake, Unreal Tournament, etc.  One nice thing I like about it is that you  get your 'upgrades' from drops from killed enemies.  One of the frustrating things of Quake, UT and similar games is that there are power ups at specific places, and it's possible to steam roll once your team sets up in certain places.  Since killed enemies(and allies) drop goodies in Minimum, that's not a problem.  You keep fighting, you keep moving, and you keep upgrading.  Armor upgrades are persistent for the round, and weapons upgrade automatically when picking up power ups(one drops per dead body).Titan looks like a fun mode.  Haven't played it, but the concept is straight forward.  The titan map I did see is really small(smaller than the TDM maps I saw!) so I imagine it's a blood bath.There's a crafting system, which, like everything else, is straightforward and minimalistic.  There's a variety of options for weapons, armors, and weapon skins.  You slowly but surely accumulate materials as you play rounds and the cost to craft new things isn't absurd(as is true with games like Warframe, where you spend *tons* of  time getting the crap needed to craft even one thing of value)Small learning curve, but tons of fun.  The 'Minimum' theme is all throughout the game, from menus to the gameplay, and I definitely think it's done right.  It makes everything feel sleek and responsive.  I much rather prefer games like this than made-for-console games that are sluggish in almost every way imaginable.I bought this on sale, but I would recommend it even at full price.  This is a great throwback to old FPS games with fast-paced arena-style action and a novel aesthetic."

Also to the guy who complained about the weapon power up mechanic.... git gud. Because honestly, I'm doing fine and the people who are owning others are... doing fine. Just play the game the way it's meant to be played.This supposed snowball effect of being overpowered literally does not exist. If your weapon is underpowered to the competition, you just have to be tactical about making your kills. And pick up power blocks that are lying around to level up your own weapons.

The game I played, I had fun with it, that said, I wouldn't recommend Minimum--not without first explaining what the gameplay had and what I felt it lacked.As a player with a very beefy computer and background in FPS games like Titanfall, in the end Minimum was too easy (more accurately, unbalanced) to be fun for as long as I thought it would. I would need some more gamemodes and a bit more refinement on the moba-like snowballing. Right now it looks like a small edge in skill balloons far too quickly into an entirely one sided slaughter, as is with many games trying to exploit the moba-shooter niche.Ulitmately, this game is fun but it just didn't have the replay value I would have expected for its price."

However be careful since this game has some issues. Read my old review for details.Full Review:I recommend this game for its AWESOME gameplay!! Especially if you wanna play alone. If it is on sale. Get it! have some fun!As soon as you want to play with friends, this game shows its ugly unfinished beta-face. Besides the plenty of bugs the matchmaking for friends is absolutly hell. Don't get me wrong, I had some very fun hours with this game. But let me just say this: It is possible to invite your friends to a party and queue for a game, BUT you will very likely not end up in the same team. :DThis is ok, for the first match you end up in, because it already started. But the game sometimes can't even manage to place you in the right team for the second match.Especially if you are more then 3 players it is impossible to play together. This disables this game to be any more then fun for a few hours. I voted it down because I am so disappointed. As I said, the gameplay is one of the best I've ever encountered, and they ruin all of this with matchmaking. What a shame.Another thing, which makes this game 'casual' is things like a flawed display for the health of the titans. This is one of the most crucial elements, and it doesn't work.Also, the game has plenty of lag-spikes, my connection is fine, I had a ping of 20ms, but I guess the netcode is just bad.Another complain I have with this game, is that it is not marked 'early access' within the store. This game is far from finished.TL;DR:If it is on sale. Get it with a friend and have one, or two evenings of really good gameplay. Don't get it if you are searching a shooter you can get into, and play often with a fixed team.Also, developers: Please finish this game! The gameplay is soooooo good."

I don't know what's causing the problem, whether it's un-optimized networking code or a game engine that simply cannot handle Minimum's special physics and effects. Or maybe it's a combination of both, or something else entirely.It certainly isn't my system specs, which are well above the recommended. At first when I start playing, the game runs smoothly at 60 fps. It runs even faster when I have vertical synch disabled, which I've tried. In fact, I've tried everything to get this game to continuously run smoothly, but nothing works.When it does run smoothly (and *sometimes* it does), it's a fun and novel take on a 3rd person, multi-player team-based shooter. I love the Lego-like theme of the game, and the many different ways you can modify your equipment and customize your loadouts, using the building blocks-gibs that drop from things you shoot and destroy (which are mainly enemy players). I also love the game's ""Titan"" mode, and the titans themselves (King Kong, Godzilla, giant mechs, samurai-colossus) are awesome. But oftentimes, as a match progresses - as the players start running and jumping and gunning, and the ballistics start zig-zagging, and the particles start flying everywhere - the game engine/networking starts choking, the framerates start dropping, and severe lag spikes start spoiling the fun."

Not to mention that their play times are under an hour so I'm not surprised. They haven't spent quite a lot of time learning the games mechanics and thus maybe leading to their eventual rage quit/ ventilation process.....Now with that out of the way.This game is a blast the moment I saw it's cover, I've been a very avid gamer who pursues games with a blocky look to them, and when I saw that it's a shooter as well I immediately took a look at it and I absolutely loved it and luckily I've waited long enough so that it finally gets a sale! :DAnimation and visuals are a 100% for me I absolutely find it eye candy and very appealing. Enaging the player is probably the number one objective in this game and it really does, the game has this gamemode that requires a player and their team to power up a titan and it's very nice since there is no way to power it up besides fight over it's resources in the spawn areas. When you have a cavalry of rifleman and shotgunners behind your back and a tank swordsman in the front charging the enemy's section of the titan powerup mines. The only feeling you have is EUPHORIA! Bringing a friend along is also a great idea because communicating is a very nice but not crucial thing you can have. If you're buddy is on the enemy team you guys can duke it out with swords and it's pretty hilarious. The combat is very much smooth and fast paced. Potential in this game is very very high. Being a skilled marksman really compensates in this game and in game items are very easy to obtain, not to mention that the game looks beautiful as well. This is the first time in FOREVER that a game has kept me hooked on that I log in daily to play it and even have me awake and engaged in it! Make the purchase while it's still on!

Clicking on a server once shows a window for a split second that shows some info including ping but it also makes you join the server. This means a dumb down.* The game can't stay connected for more than 3 minutes. Also there are lag issues. I find myself teleporting several times every match and issues with hit detection. Grenades don't explode half of the time.* The beam rifle is way too weak. Too low DPS and DPM and takes forever to reload. Compare to the default rifle which kills way faster and can kill several enemies before reload. The beam gun also has the most issues with hit detection and when it does hit it produces a huge spark effect on the target, obscuring it. The plasma launcher seems weak too and it's projectiles don't explode half of the time.* Some of the windows when doing the customizing stuff covers the resources so you can't see how much you have. The resource cost of the items aren't even in the same order as the ones you have. You have to write down how much you have then open the window where you spend it and compare.* Tooltips when holding the mouse on the buttons is too slow. Takes 3 seconds when it should take 0.5. The pictures of the menu buttons are less than obvious so you have to see the tooltip to know what they do.* Graphics could use improvement too by having shadows casts from more than just 1 light source on the map. Also the simple meshes and textures makes the quality of the lighting more noticeble. Having exceptionally good lighting would be great in this game."

Whether this was due to the high price of the game I'm not sure. If the dev's were looking to revamp the demand in this game then the only solution (in my eyes) is to open it free for people to play just until they get enough customers to increase the popularity.- Bots :PDon't get me wrong.

,Recommended,214190,12190839,"Posted: 22 September, 2014",all,PikaFlare,"Well, this was certainly a surprise! I'd only recently heard of Minimum and after looking up some videos about it, I decided to gamble $10 on it. I was not dissapointed in the slightest. Minimum is a third-person shooter set in a low detail, poligonal world where your team must defeat the other team in two of the competitive modes. The first mode available is the classic Team Deathmatch where you try to get more kills than the opposing team. The real meat on the bone for this game though has to be Titan mode. In this game type, you and your teammates must gather resources by killing creeps. Doing this will add strength to your titan. The objective is to overpower the other teams titan, have your titan bring down their defenses, and then have your titan destroy the opposing team's power core. Titan mode gets really hectic and is a total blast, especially when your team actually coordinates. The last game mode is a coop survival mode which was fun, but didn't keep my attention for long. The lack of other game modes is slightly dissapointing and I hope to see more in the future. The gameplay itself is very fast paced and chaotic as well. Gun selections are your standard fare of shotguns, assault rifles, katanas, snipers, and plasma launchers. What makes Minimum stand apart from other shooters, however, is the way weapons are utilized throughout the game. Everytime you kill an enemy, they will drop energy which will level up your weapon for that life. Every weapon has 5 levels and they become more and more powerful the more enemies you kill. Once you die, you'll start from scratch and have to level them up once again. You can also craft armor in the middle of a match which can give you certain stat boosts and unlike weapons, armor doesn't go away or level down throughout the entire match. This does lead to a slight complaint, that being game balance. The game does suffer from some bad balance issues and often you'll find yourself fighting several people with god like weapons at once. It's the classic scenario of ""The rich get richer"". There are instances in game where you will spawn at level 3, but this is usually near the end of matches.One of the main ""gimmicks"" with Minimum is its simplistic art style. Not only does it give the game a unique feel so unlike any other online game I've played, but it also makes things very clear and distinct. The enemy team is always red and they can be easy to spot out of the enviornment. The maps also look really nice as well as the Titans. Speaking of maps, they're actually really well made in this game. All of the maps are well contructed with numerous routes for players to take and also have spawn protection. In fact, if an someone kills an enemy who just spawned, they will actually recieve a point deduction which is a good attempt at trying to prevent spawn camping.The matchmaking in Minimum has worked out rather nicely for me. I've noticed some complaints about their game constantly crashing, but I have not experienced this very often (only one time). Due to its simplistic style, the game also has really fast loading times and everything renders rather well. I've also experienced very little lag during the time I've played as well. One thing I really like as well is the support Human Head Studios has put into the game. Since I've owned this game, there have been numerous updates and announcements for future content. There are actaully a lot of menus that are completely inaccessible which I can only assume is for planned future content. I really hope they continue to support this game throughout the years.Overall, Minimum is unique, fast-paced, intriguing, and just downright fun to play. If you enjoy third person shooters like Loadout or Warframe, you'll most likely get a lot of enjoyment out of it. It was well worth the 10 bucks and I truly hope this game will live and grow in many years to come."

Otherwise you're probably gonna have a bad time.I wish I could love this game. Despite being so minimalistic graphics wise, it's far too demanding on resources. I'm running a 2.8 GHz quad core CPU with a 2gb graphics card and 6gb of RAM, the game still doesn't run as smooth as it should (I'm aware of the recommended RAM requirement of 8GB). The tethering that occurs in the case of lag makes the game unplayable, and I'm usually within 30-80 ms ping according to the game.Otherwise, everything's great. Love the game's ideas. Not very keen on having an in game shop to buy skins for even more money, but that's the developer's perogative."

Due to lackluster internet connection, I never got to play it for as long as I wanted, however, it was honestly great. Then something happened with the servers. The devs had to shut them down for some form of a rehall. In and of itself, I didn't mind because I thought that when the servers were back, I can enjoy the game at its fullest again. However, the wait was long and the player base didn't wait patiently and so when the servers eventually came up again, there were only a few players remaining and those didn't last very long. Right now, the game is practically dead which is honestly a terrible shame. The devs had created something special here and it had the potential to take off if they had just worked harder. If you want to try this game out for yourself, the best thing you can do if get a group of friends interested and start up a private lobby and play there. You will find that the game at its core is very good but just not supported.Saying that, if the devs suddenly reboot the game and add a lot of new content.
