76561198013132245,Not Recommended,214360,11071567,"Posted: 4 July, 2014",all,huminado,"my only take-away from this thread is:It's far better to pre-release games as alpha, and incorporate many sales to attract a wide-player (tester) base.  This game was released in August 2012, so by the time I encountered the bug I saw, it had already been released over half a year.  I was playing what was promoted as a released non-alpha, non-beta, polished, clean product.By telling players ""this is just alpha code"" - all sorts of bugs are forgiven.  It just changes the whole tone, and it also scares players like me away.  I don't want to be anybody's alpha or beta tester and pay for it unless the game is extremely compelling.  That's just my personal approach as a consumer.So I don't know if my review is a troll.  If anyone asked me ""do you recommend this game"" - my review is exactly what comes to mind when I see this game, especially when I visit the forums and get that dirty message in red at the top.  It was a power play by the dev ""you didn't follow protocol.  Nananana.""  Or at least that's what it felt like for me getting banned.Today I played 2 multiplayer games, and I didn't see the issue that had happened before.  It's quite possible that the issue has been addressed.And there's really no point in dwelling on ""here's what so and so did wrong"".  I'd rather find a solution, and for me that solution is, it's much safer to call a game alpha than go through this sort of mess.--------------------------------------- ORIGINAL REVIEW BELOW ------------------------------------You have been permanently banned from all Tower Wars discussions.You were banned by a Tower Wars developer.Reason: ""Not following protocol to submit a bug report.""This is how this developer treats customers.  If the customer runs into a problem with the product, ban them from the forums.  Permanently.  Which leaves a pretty bad taste in my mouth.  I can't recommend a game by a dev who treats people like this.And for the gory details: my mouse would lock up attached to an object in the middle of games.  I couldn'tgo to the menus, NOTHING.  Multiplayer games would log me as having quit the game, when it was a bug.Of course NOBODY else saw this bug.  Well it turned out, eventually, that I figured out (no thanks to thedevs) that this only happened when my video settings were maxed out (monitor is 2560x1600).  So therewas a workaround - and they might have addressed this too.But I'm still banned from their forums.[EDIT: It looks like they have indeed added a single player campaign, so I've removed the statement that signle player is missing.]Avoid this one."

These low ranked accounts then end up getting matched against players that are playing at their true ranking. Since the scoring is handicapped, this leads to the honest players not gaining anything much when they win, but they will end up losing more times than enough and will have large amounts of points taken away.On paper, they will be losing to a noob and so get penalised, but in reality they are losing to players with skills that place him in the top 10.So, even at the bottomm rungs of the ladder, expect to find excellent players who will take great delight in making sure you end up frustrated and hating this game.Since the game is predominently multiplayer (the bots are fun for a while), what you are paying for is to be meat in the grinder.Avoid."

Which is immediately a harder difficulty. You unlock all your characters and towers in one game.So the next level is only harder, barely anything new, just harder to defeat.I very much prefer to play more of a campaign/story line where you don't experience everything at once so there is something interesting to look forward to when you progress in the game."

Nothing special here, typical set of towers available.You send your own armies to attack enemy in order to get battle points which allow you to unlock new units and upgrade old ones. There's more freedom here, and if you know what you're doing, this is a great place to showcase your tactical skills, especially at late stages of the game when some interesting units are available.There's also a little resources gathering aspect to the game.Biggest trick is to efficiently balance your defence, offence, upgrades and resources. If you screw up anywhere, you're done.There's one huge problem with this game, which is why this is a negative review. It has pretty much no tutorial available, no single-player campaign to gradually develop your skills, UI is un-intuitive, controls are messed up, etc. All you have are bots, weakest of which will probably defeat you up to five times untill you grasp basics of the game, and after that you only have try-and-fail approach to figure out why some more sophisticated things work and some don't.And then, playing multiplayer, game becomes over-competetive pretty fast, so unless it's inline whith your character, you will not be able to really casually enjoy the game ...It's a pity, if devs would've spent a little more time to implement decent in-game tutorial and usable UI and controlls, game would be much more playable."

AND send out units to act as enemies FOR the opposing team, who has to defend themselves by building their OWN towers. If it would have been a perfect game, it would have gotten a 10 for a really cool mix-up of the genre. But sadly, it's far from perfect. This game has a VERY steep learning curve, and when it was first released it had virtually no singleplayer until they updated it, but guess what? The first bot for singleplayer is hard if you don't know what the hell to do, and the description for it says otherwise! Also, there isn't that much variation and only 10 bots to fight against, meaning this game is predominantly multiplayer, which I honeslty don't like for the TD genre. I'd say to skip this one and get Defense Grid: The Awakening instead if at full price, but it's on sale for 2 bucks frequently, and for that price, I'd say it's worth it."

This isn't your grannies Bloon Wars, babies!  If you're too good at the rest, come play with the best.  A super-helpful and friendly community, addicting gameplay, ranked seasons where players who truly put in the effort can win fame and prizes and a delightfully whimsical Steampunk art style.  The learning curve is high, but those who perservere and learn the ropes march towards glory.  Be warned:  You WILL get your backsides handed to you your first few rounds in multiplayer, but not to fret.  The community has done a great job of creating guides and videos that are easily available to get new players up to speed, and the guy who just slaughtered you in six rounds will also more than likely be totally willing to give you a practice round or two to show you how things work.  All that said, my favorite part of this game is actually the audio and voice acting.  Skillfully put together, it matches the art in theme and energy, and the voices of both the King and the troops are amusing even when you're on a losing streak."

I've played PixelJunk Monsters, and I was also a huge fan of the Warcraft III Tower Defense mini-games onBattle.net. While Tower Wars isn't exactly like either of those, although similar, to me it seems like one of the most challenging.The game allows you to ""maze"", where you create your towers in a maze pattern, to lengthen the path of travel the minions must take, and at the same time challenges you to either create a maze, or cluster your towers together.It's a pretty simple game, but among all of the tower defense games I've played, I really like the way the maps challenge your strategizing skills.It's really a great game.

I found Tower Wars on sale and immediately grabbed as I'm a fan of worlds created with hexagonal terrains put together.The game resembles Tropical Tower Wars, a custom WarCraft III map that I used to play. Instead of having a fixed pathways and a place for your towers, you create the maze yourself. The world is made out of hexagon tiles separated into different islands. Three gold mines for each team are randomly placed in the map to create diversity for your mazing strategies.Controls[+] Not much to say on this as the game uses the most conventional controls for any Tower Defense game. In the time that I played I haven't felt any type of discomfort even once.Graphics[+] As I said before, I am a fan of game terrain made out of hexagon tiles.[+] The maps for different modes was well made allowing different kinds of strategies to be put to use.Balance[+] The bots are good for people who are learning the game. They start from easy and eventually gets more challenging as you defeat more of them one by one.[+] The game gives you freedom on how you want to handle your mazes.[+] It also has a route detector to make the game eye-friendly despite building a big amount of towers and stops you from messing up in case you get confused in your own maze.[-] Although it gets challenging as you pick higher level of bots. The only difference you see is the rate of how fast they upgrade their towers, and mines. They keep recycling the same strategy over and over.Others[+] Variety of maps to choose from.[+] You can either play defensive, offensive, or balance depending on how you wish to control the game.[-] Few people are playing and on that ""few people"" even fewer people plays Human vs. Human.

There is no single player mode to play against the AI to find out the strengths and weaknesses of towers, units or the tech tree.Multiplayer only contains 4 maps, and given the indie nature of the game there aren't a lot of active players so you could be waiting a while for a match."

You need a few hours to master all the mechanics, but then it's great entertainment.You and your opponent both have castles and barracks, and you need to send waves to destroy each other, while simultaneously upgrading your units and castles as well as tending to your gold mines. Gold is mainly needed for recruiting units, and as long as they are within enemy territory, they earn ""battle points"" for you, which you need for upgrades. This makes for some challenging gameplay, as you need gold to earn battle points, but also battle points to get upgrades to earn more gold, ...There are many different units, each with unique attributes - speed, health, damage dealt (against opponent's castle), armor, shield. Some have special abilities, e.g. they increase other units' speed or improve their shields.Similarly, there are lots of different towers with unique strengths and weaknesses, e.g. arrow towers, cannons, lava distributors, fans (to slow down the enemy's units) etc.There are a few maps shipped with the game and you can download additional maps from the community. The gold mines are always placed randomly, which means that for every match, you need to come up with a new path around which to build your defense towers (although you will always be using the same basic structures).I recommend that you buy this on sale and get additional keys for your friends, because as mentioned above, it's hard to even find opponents for multiplayer, and the matching can take ages. But I have spent way too many hours playing against buddies now and we're all hooked!PROS:[+] Challenging game mechanics[+] Awesome multiplayer mode (1v1, 2v2, 3v3)[+] Many maps to choose from and random adjustments in each round[+] Very cool steampunk settingCONS:[-] Steep learning curve (although this becomes rewarding if you don't give up early)[-] Very few people ""out there"" for multiplayer matches (but it's more fun with friends anyway)[-] Boring co-op mode"

After over 80 hours of game play and frustration I learned that the secret to beating this game is competitive thinking, and a ballance of everything you have to do. You cannot focus on gold but not upgrade units. You cannot focus on units and not on upgrade shields and other abilities.on top of all, your route that you creat for your enemy has to be complet and have many twists and turns. the more the enemy has to move atound corners and twist and turn, the slower they are.lava towers are almost useless, don't waste time with them. your best towers are the bows, cannons and fans to slow down the enemy. As well as the shock towers?a good strategy of taking down shields, while being able to attack in a split second makes all the difference.If you like a challenge and thinking on your feet. i highly reccommend this tower defence game."

I bought it on a chance on steam sale, and honestly in hind sight I'd have easily payed more than the full asking price for this game. I've sunk 25 hours into it and I'm no where near done with it. The graphics are basic, but HIGHLY polished and good looking. This game will most certainly age well for the style they've chosen. It's a tower defence with RTS elements so you are both attacker and defender, the game has a steam punk theme, good music well directed art, and has very few bugs which is impressive generally, but particularly for a smaller development scheme.The single player is challenging even at the lower levels, so if you want to fight bots they have everything from ""I'm barely paying attention"" to ""How is it even possible to generate units that quickly?!?"" and unlike bots in most games, these will actually ready you for playing against other players.. Which is good because you can rock 3 vs 3's in this title and oh my god will you.Balanced enough that you can't even gripe when you lost because you messed up or the other player managed their resources better than you did.Do I recommend this game? ABSOLUTELY. Normally I would say why aren't you buying it right now, but that doesn't do it justice. Buy the three pack, give copies to two people you play with regularly and remember to invite me."

Gold is used for building/upgrading towers and also for sending units.Battle points are earned by the units you send out. Battle points are spent for unit upgrades, unlocking new units, buying minersThere aren't as many types of towers or creep units types as I'd wish but it ok:- around 8 types of towers ( each can be upgraded 3 times - but it's a liniar upgrade, no branches or other abilities/customization of towers)- around 10 units(again each with some upgrades)- castle upgrades for armor or damage- a pretty complex tree structure for speed/armor/shield/health and other stuff as general upgrades for all unitsAt first it was a little strange the way you choose/upgrade towers(hold and drag mouse) but I got used with it and then I found out you can also use key shortcuts(shift+click,ctrl+click)"

And while it follows the ""Mazing"" style of TDs (you have no predetermined path enemies take. you have a patch of land and the enemies will take the shortest route towards your Fortress) it also forces you to focus on how you will attack.You gain resources by killing enemies and having your people waddle as far as they can.Now the Towers and Enemies are where the fun starts. You are not presented with the standart ""Normal tower/ Faster but weaker tower/Splash Tower/Slow Tower"" variety, but rather towers that focus on different kinds of Health as well as some supporting towers, like a wind turbine that slows enemies in its path or a huge pot that throws boiling oil to all its sides.As far as the offensive units go, you go from the why do I worry-kind of standart waddler, faster waddlers, healing waddlers, shielding waddlers, carrying waddlers, as well as Upgrades for them. in the end I believe you stand with as many supporting units as you have actual damaging units.Rounds may be short (if any of the players really messes up his BO) or can draw out to a 2 hour ""We all send a full wave of our biggest units, all fully upgraded through each others maze and look what happens""-Stalemate. but even those are fun, because its like a snail race.

Sure it has a survival mode to play it that way but that's not the sole action of this game. It's a tower defender and attacker! That's right you have to go on the offence or no matter how great you planning if you only defend you will fail. In fact if your balance of attach vs defence is even a little off you will fail. The computer baddys are tough, and may even break you heh.The real grabber with this game though is the online portion. You can battle with or against friends and strangers from across the world. Yes I used the plural, you can join with up to two other people per team (3 total) for a 6 player game! This is a fantasticly fun way to play. Mixing more than one mind into the game makes it a lot of fun, and a bit more challenging. Things happen fast, so don't plan on a extended set up period. A game can be completed in just a few turns or it can last for up to an hour (In one battle I had so far) all depending on the skill level and a little bit of luck in mine placements which are always random.The good:Instant funDecent ""Cartoony"" graphicssmooth, lag free playPlay with friends!New exciting twist to the tower defence genreThe bad:Can be a little slow to loadYou don't get the option to ""Rematch"" and the game quits out on it's own after a match. So no chanceto ask the other player to a hosted battle for a rematch either.The above makes meeting new people that play and growing your circle in the game a bit harder than it should be.You can always use the steam ""Recently Played"" list but you shouldn't have to."

I must warn that it is primarily head-to-head tower defense, so none of the storyline or RPG tie-ins that other titles offer. Still, it's very well-made and is a great example of the genre. You build towers to channel and kill enemies, while balancing resource production, units to pressure your enemy, your defenses, and upgrading your units to do more damage. It's a pretty interesting priority based system where every game plays out very differently based on how you and your opponent react. The way it makes me think is more like a RTS than a tower defense game. Pretty good."

Focus too much on your towers, and your enemy will overwhelm you with a superior economy; but focus too much on creating an army and your defenses will fall to even the puniest wave.The ecnomy of the game requires two currencies:  Gold (used to purchase troops, unlock new troops, and build and upgrade towers) which is mined through randomly placed mines that must be upgraded, and Battle Points (used to upgrade toops and mines) which is gained through sending troops into battle.  The interdependency of these two currencies further requires maintaining a delicate balance between offense and defense.Battles can be decisive and quick if the skills are mismatched; but if you find a good opponent, then you'll find yourself in for a campaign of attrition which could take upwards of two hours.  It's a high stakes tower defense game that offers a high amount of replayability; but the lack of map content (three total) leaves a lot to be desired when it comes to diversity of content."

The controls are easy to grasp, with plently of shortcuts for common  tower placements to place clutch buildings down in the nic of time.Hand in hand with the idea of  commanding an army and a maze, you are needed to manage a plethora of upgrades for your towers, units, and even your castle. These upgrades demand players to strike a balance between offence and defence, and makes  ""turtling up"" or ""going all out"" not the best stategies, expecially in longer games.If you are a fan of classic tower defense games, I would suggest this game to you in a heartbeat."

At round two the bots will start to send upgraded and new units at you continually. In that same amount of time I am able to put up 3-4 towers and send out a wave of 5-6 units. Difficulty seems very broken and punishing to me.That being said. I really like this game. Love the concept, the graphics, voice acting, music(amazing music actually). The brutal bot difficulty(why not have an adjustable difficulty for single player?) is keeping me from being completely in love with it.I do absolutely recommend this game though. It is very well done and multiplayer matches are an absolute blast(especially with a group of friends on skype or local lan.) My only complaint is the one that I mentioned involving the single player experience.*FWIW. In the menu when you click tutorial, it will bring up the single player menu again. You have to click Tutorial again to actually play it. A very minor issue but an odd one considering the ""Tutorial"" button is on the main screen but it does not actually take you to the tutuorial.*Update* I must say that I am impressed with how much the maker of this game has been in the  forum responding to comments and giving feedback to the players.

The few tower types make the game slightly disappointing, but the upgrades make it worth it. The main problem I have with it is the co-op gameplay.The co-op gameplay consists of only one map. This would be barely ok if it weren't for the fact that the difficulty on this map is just damn near impossible. Eventually the boss just kills your entire maze bringing it down to 1/4 of your once used build space. And the zone that gets overtaken is now a spawning point. To top things off, this boss is nuking and instagibing sections of your maze. This would all be fine, if it didn't become so frustratingly impossible at the end of the 3rd wave. Honestly I think it needs to be redone to a possible difficulty, and keep the current one and call it ""Impossible Mode.""TL;DR this is a good game to play solo. Not suitable for co-op unless you and your buddy wanna pay $10 for one map that's nigh impossible to beat. 6/10 would play again... but barely."

Tower Wars is a challenging tower-defence game, but with a twist where in one game mode you can send out armies to attack the enemy to gain battle tokens. Even if they don't reach they castle, you get tokens based on how far they go.I find it enjoyable, even when losing which is easy if you don't get a good balance of putting up towers, shaping the path, putting up the right de-buffing towers and so on. It's cartoonish effects make the game a lot of fun t play and there are 10 levels of difficulty to play, though from what I can tell no actual story in the game itself.However a big complaint I have is that it seems to be prone to crashing. I'm uncertain if this is a common factor on other people's systems, but it does seem to be prone to crashing, though when it does crash it just closes rarther than going black screen or forcing steam to crash which tells me it's possibly being worked on in patches.

It has 2 nice little talent trees.My first 2v2 game was against 2 totally new players like myself, we both built huge complex mazes and played for about 30-40 mins unlocking the top Creeps and fully upgrading them, we won because our maze was a little better and we timed our creeps on Skype to be released at the same time in one big wave at the end.Fun game....our 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th game was against people who could play, they build 5-6 towers in a blob at the start of the map then blobed up at the start with no attempt to build any sort of maze.....  these towers killed our creeps before they got on the map, we had no Battle points, and could do ♥♥♥♥ all... no upgrades, no mines, no money, no new creeps......  Crushed 4 times ???????????Since you need Battle points to get better units to Get battle points.... the knock on effect is game breaking.A little google told us that most games are won or lost in the first 45-90 seconds (waves unlock after 45 seconds then every 45) and the game is about building towers that kill units before they get close to the map.... tower defence....  nope...  not in this gamesooo game 6 we built 5 towers at the start but one of there units got on the map, none of ours did GG we loose tho it takes 15 mins to play it out.Game 7, we build 6 towers at the start, 45 seconds, we kill all there units, one of the Opposing players leaves he sees its a clear win... we play on for 15 mins, vs the holdout for the win.Playing a little on-line on my own told the same story, no VoIP sucks and most games...  you win or loose after the first 90 seconds and people just Quit after that since quitting doesn't drop your On-line ranking????This game really needs VoIP since your really need to communicate with the other player, it also needs some sort of marking system because 2 people building there own idea of the perfect maze when you can't sell each others towers...... ""Can you please sell that lightning tower 4 off from the middle, on the left, 2 down from that flame tower, NO NOT THAT ONE""This game is a real shame, you can unlock creeps with heavy armour, that need to be countered with cannons, Creeps with heavy shields that need lightning towers to counter them, creeps that increase the waves run speed/health/drop aoe healing.... it even has fun mega lava fortress towers.... none of these really see any action, since the Battle point starvation tactic beats....  everythingI am not sure how they can fix this."

The number of towers is small, with most of them being useless, the upgrades are negligable, and the gameplay simply lacks satisfaction as 90% of the enemies fall not to all your carefully placed traps, but make it through to the final ""fine we'l kill them for you"" part of the map. Single player is a joke. I had the whole path triple layered in every kind of usefull tower and a majority of the enemies made it through unscathed. It might be better in multiplayer, but the game sure as hell doesn't stand up on it's singleplayer.The steampunk caught my eye and I was disapointed in that regard, too. It feels really lacking in overall design. Levels (at least the first few I tried) feel baren, the enemies are creative only in close ups, and the actual defences don't really have any substance to them.Overall, I'd rather just play a free flash game."

The types of towers you can make can each be upgraded, and all of it is very neat and tidy, but there is just something unfortunate about how unbearably ""Realistic"" it is. I don't want cannons and arrows and fans, not beyond the initial ""early stages"" gameplay. I want monkeys wth laser-beams coming out of their eyes, I want dragon-roosts, I want Lich-towers that spam some wierd slimey crud and you don't really know nor care what it actually is, but only that it does good damage against certain armor types.The game doesn't move fast enough, and at the same time, it is like trying to crush ants with a hammer.

If your intention was to provide a learning mechanism for the game and make newer players feel welcome into the game then you have failed miserably at the first step.What's worse is that despite months and months of similar complaints the same issues still remain and the devs and the player base who have cracked the code will defend it completely thus proving more of a barrier to new players.Broken game, waste of money."

But it is clearly focussed on PvP (1v1, 2v2, 3v3) and the other modes seem like 2nd-class citizens. There is just a single coop level & mode - disappointing.2.) The UI does not work well for me, both in input and output. The tower placing mechanism is error prone. Several hours of playing (and watching the UIs feedback) did not lead me to defeat one of the simpler bots. Reading steam community guides for a couple of minutes allowed me to even compete with players.3.) 2 years after release i still encountered 3 bugs, 1 of which tipped a head-to-head pvp match to my opponents favor by not allowing me to place towers where i needed them (they could legally be placed there).Edit: Reduced UI critic, as the info i was lacking to suceed is present and i just never recognized it."

As you create towers throughout the hexagonal spaces that’s in your lands, you also spawn your army from a barracks which travels to their lands. I liked this idea, but then felt that the developers had tried to include too much in the game. With a dozen different towers and units to use, you have upgrades for each individual tower, upgrade trees for your units and towers, upgrade trees for your barracks and castle, two resources to use for towers, units and upgrades; several different mines to gain resources which can each be upgraded individually… ok so there’s too much to upgrade.The main problem for me was that the game wasn’t engaging enough to keep me playing. Maybe a single-player campaign would have been enough to keep me playing. While game might be complex, the learning curve is still decent, just finicky. Aesthetically the game was OK, Steampunk being something that can never get old, but generally not enough to make a game great. This all being said, I never tried the multiplayer which is the game’s focus… so maybe I missed the fun part.For full review, visit:http://icarusreviews.net/2014/02/21/brief-write-of-a-brief-flight-tower-wars/"

I don't know enough about computer processing to explain the details you need to get this game to run smooth, all I can tell you is that it runs beautifully on my Windows Surface Pro 3.  What I can tell you is that it is a whitty game that breaks the fourth-wall (For those of you who don't know:The Fourth Wall is a term in entertainment when the character has a thought about the watcher, or user sometimes in the form of ""I wonder if this is some kind of games and we are all just pawns""  or the characters just outright acknowledge you as a player in a sense that you aren't apart of their universe)  It can be quite fun, and is a good time waster if your at work and want two hours to kill.  The singleplayer is mainly versing higher level intelligence bots, not much to it, but if your that type of person thats easy to please, and doesnt need complexity it can be really enjoyable.  Also I do know it takes a long time to find a match in PvP.  If you play with a friend it is better.  Overall  the fact that this game is a time-waster (in a goodway) and has achievements is great!  I personally like to achievement hunt, but the fact that a smaller game with not so difficult achievements gives me a break, and its just interesting to see what objectives the game will amek you complete.   However, if you are not good with focus, or multitasking I DO NOT reccomend this game for you as you will get frustrated with trying to build and upgrade defenses, also trying to make them into a maze.  Dispatch troops, and upgrade that aswell. And finally trying to upgrade your gold mines and castles at the same time."

There aren't that many selections for towers (and even with those selections, you pretty much only use 3-4 of them) and I don't think there are enough levels of tower upgrades (only 3) which means many of the AI troops can walk through all your defenses.... yet their unupgraded towers manage to decimate your troops still.Personally, I'd recommend ""Defense grid"" over this 9 days a week."

Lack of that sens of ""am i doing good or bad? how good I am doing?"". The single player missions seem pointless, as the game does not tell you how other people did, and gives you no score or achievement to aim for. I played the first level for an hour, survived everything and upgraded everything, yet i felt like i wasted an hour... What was the point? Againt you can't compare your performance and have no point of reference, so the whole thing is an exercice in futility no matter how well you do.It seems the developers want you to jump into multiplayer and go against other people. But I do not believe that the system  is robust enough for multiplayer, the upgrades, towers, stats, units, nothing seems optimised, balanced, or even transparent in what it does and that is really unatractive for someone looking for a competitive game.Since the game is not transparent in its stats, it forces you to read guides and spend time on the forums, instead of simply playing and thinking / figuring out things for yourself (which i find is the most enjoyable aspect of tower defense games : number crunching), since i can't number crunch here i'd rather uninstall this game than rely in the community to tell me what is good and what is not. Seriously what would be the point of adopting solutions designed by others? You'd just be a bot running the cookie cutter solutions of another, instead of figuring out things for yourself. Not my idea of fun.All in all this is a tower game with a single innovative feature, but seeing as it does neither single player nor multiplayer well, there is no reason to buy it unless it gets heavily patched.Also looking at the dozen people on my friend list who bought this game, i don't see anyone who played this title for more than 2 hours, which reinforces the idea that this game is not very fun and offers very little bang for the buck.Time to uninstall this and go back to Defense Grid."

The single player is one of the reasons why I like the game and it should also be a reason for people to get it. The single player is a good way to learn how to play the game (even though there is a tutorial). You could think of different ways to try and win a game. Also there are a few maps to play on but after a while it could get repetitive and that is the reason why I rate it 8/10 and not 10/10. Besides the standard gamemode there is one more. Although the standard gamemode is better overall.If you have a computer that just makes the requirements (like me), expect to be turning down the quality of how it runs and how it looks (the gameplay still looks pretty good though).

Tower Wars isn't an easy game.  In fact, I found it annoyingly difficult for no good reason.  I also found the tutorial to be lacking and the enormous plethora of available upgrades for towers, buildings and troops along with the equally enormous plethora of available towers and troops in the first place, much too daunting to get me to want to play in the slightest.I would not recommend this to anyone unless you are a true Tower Defense savant and really want to give it a shot.

It's got all the classic elements of a good tower defence game, and the hex-based grid is awesome.Things I Like:[+] Tower defense mechanics.[+] Single Player gameplay is challenging and rewarding.[+] Hex based grid is just fantastic.[+] Gameplay is unique (as far as I'm aware anyway.)[+] The art such as tower models, and characters are very nice, as well as the maps, effects, all of it. It's very sleek.[+] Maps and the randomness created by the mines moving around each game is awesome.[+] The audio (including character voices) is amusing and well-done.[+] User Interface is generally well-designed, and amusing, and looks good.[+] The camera is perfect.Issues:[-] User Interface and I have our disagreements. I want it to go back to a menu or let me restart right after I lose angrily and it just sits there and I hit buttons to try to make it go away, until it lets me exit the current map.[-] When exiting a map that you just lost (or won), there is small text that must be clicked, and I haven't found a key on the keyboard to make it click through. I would like to be able to hit [ESC] or [ENTER] and have it go back to the menu at that point.[-] I often find myself accidentally clicking and then it defaults to building a tower where I had no intention of putting a tower, and then I am sad.[-] From what I've played it doesn't seem there's a lot of genuine strategy. You just have to balance upgrading mines, units, and global unit stats, and keep everything moving in the right direction and build a standard set of towers with as long a maze as possible. If you build some towers in large quantities, you'll lose, if you focus on one type of upgrades, you'll lose.[-] UI doesn't agree with my pen tablet entirely. when I click to upgrade a tower it clicks constantly, and sometimes does odd things, which isn't that surprising.[-] Hotkeys for things are not displayed. If I could hover over the send button and it would say something like ""[SPACE] to Send Troops"" or ""[1] to queue this troop"". Those keyboard shortcuts are useful but I only learned them through the tutorial or tips or guesswork. I like hovering over things for information.[-] Hovering over units does not give any info about what unit they are or their health. I assume that's how they planned it, but I would very much like more information at my fingertips.[-] I find it hard to build a complex maze in a hex-grid (but that said, I'd still take a hex grid any day.)Other notes:[~] Gameplay is exceedingly challenging, getting me stuck on one bot for quite some time in single-player, and I can only imagine it's even harder against real people, as I'm sure I'll find out soon. It's a very delicate balancing act. The fact that it is hard is not a bad thing though. It's just not for people who aren't up for a serious challenge, or those with lots of skill already in other tower defense games.[~] Each game can be quite long, but I enjoy long games so I don't consider this bad.[~] Full disclosure: I bought it during the summer sale, for a very low price. I do think it's worth the asking price though, for sure.Conclusion:I love this game, despite it's flaws. I love it's style, I love hexagon-based games, and I love it's mechanics. If you're looking for a fun, straightforward tower defense game, I highly recommend it. This game requires patience, and a willingness to learn."

AND send out units to act as enemies FOR the opposing team, who has to defend themselves by building their OWN towers. If it would have been a perfect game, it would have gotten a 10 for a really cool mix-up of the genre. But sadly, it's far from perfect. This game has a VERY steep learning curve, and when it was first released it had virtually no singleplayer until they updated it, but guess what? The first bot for singleplayer is hard if you don't know what the hell to do, and the description for it says otherwise! Also, there isn't that much variation and only 10 bots to fight against, meaning this game is predominantly multiplayer, which I honeslty don't like for the TD genre. """

The method to place a tower is AWFUL. Click and hold mouse button down on a hex, rotate to your selection and release.Personally I prefer games where you don't have to 'maze'. This is like Fieldrunners in that you are free to build wherever you like on the board and route the enemies through your city of death.The game maxed out my Radeon 7950, no slowdown but the fan was full on. I guess that's a side-effect using what appears to be a third-party 3D engine with no optimisation.Oh and about that tutorial (which seemed to have been added after most of these reviews were posted): I have never heard such a lacklustre piece of voice-acting in my life. It sounds like the guy was pushed into a sound booth, a microphone shoved in his face and forced to narrate the whole thing in a terrible Mockney accent in a single take before he was allowed his first cup of coffee of the day.It was on sale but I don't even feel I got my £1.39's worth, I can't see myself playing it again.There ARE better tower defence games out there."

,Not Recommended,214360,8473964,"Posted: 31 December, 2013",all,TofuTakahashi,"Tower Wars, what more is there to say? The game plays around the game mode made popular by War Craft III in which the player constructs towers in a maze to protect their base (or in this game's instance, their castle). Its a simple style of gameplay for a very casual game that can be both relaxing, or in more difficult settings absolutely intense. Unfortunately, Tower Wars fails to deliver on any of that excitement that made tower defence games so very popular in the years past.A few review note this game as being easy, others stating that it is hard. Overall, the game is easy--until you hit the absolute best in any given map in which case its a waiting game for the creeps to get strong enough to make it to your castle. Games lasting an hour or more of just waiting for your maxed out maze to finally be defeated while you sit hopeless...and bored. That is the survival mode in a nutshell--lifeless and easy. Aided with a rather terrible user interface and rather bad maps it feels uninspired and a chore to get into.There now is multiplayer too, which like one of the single player modes adds the the ability to spend gold to buy ""creeps"" to send to the oppossing player's maze. This verses style worked fantastic in days past--the perfect balance in deciding to spend money for either offencive play or defencive play. While Tower Wars continues on this great gameplay, some of the same reasons that make the single player so dry still exist in multiplayer making it one of those games which simply does not draw the player in.Sure, my ideas of tower defence games is carved from the various mods from the early days of their introduction as mods for various Blizzard games, but I gave Tower Wars a chance to work with the genre to create new and interesting gameplay and build on it. It adds hexagonal tiles, which could have resulted in amazing new ways to making new mazes, alas the maps do not even permit very complex mazes thanks to their size. I simply cannot recommend this game to anyone, especially at the asking price of $8. It quite simply falls short."

In this game you can either play classic tower defence with non-stop enemy waves, which includes a co-op mode or you can go head to head with a player or a computer, where both sides build towers AND send troops at the enemy team. The trick is to balance how much you spend on attack or defence. The game is a medival steampunk setting and has crisp graphics that are quite appealing- My rating 8/10 check it out  its on sale until January 3rd"

What more do you need to know?Ok, so you want to know more?Two sides, each one constructs a tower defense that will slow down the mindless grunts being sent by the opposing player.  Both sides do this while sending wave after wave of mindless units to attack the enemy castle.Good variety of units though some not all that useful.Overall, I like it.

I never played MP so far just startet like a week ago with the SP against the bots. I took me about 20 attempts to beat the easiest bot (WTF??). I played the tutorial first but this doesn't help a bit with the game mechanics. You learn the hud, thats it and then you have to go through frustrating hours against the AI unless you understand the basic mechanics like forcing enemys to spend their money on towers not troops and so on.I've been playing this for a week now and after the hard start it got a lot better. I managed to win vs the next bots in a few attempts and had a lot of fun. But now I've reached like a dead end. I'm trying to win against the AI lvl 6 and no mater how the game goes at the beginning its just frustrating to be in the lead for like 30 minutes and get bashed in like 5 minutes by suddenly unstopable waves. How can I have more income more BP stop every wave, send own, upgrade and so on and suddenly the AI becomes OVERWHELMING. Forums are filled with people talking bout how easy all the bots are and so on, but whatever. As everybody knows bot 9 and 10 are cheating. But the others are as well in a more subtle way. Having infinite APM (@developer it seems so, is it true?). And other things that don't seem to be fair. Disregarding the fact of tower placing and wave setup, my shielders always get focused whereas my towers tend to ignore them. Maybe thats just ""luck"" for the AI but nevertheless frustrating.I paid 2 bucks for a week of fun so its absolutely worth it. For people that play the MP I guess its worth it anyhow."

While there are a plethora of options for the game, I find that I can't pull my camera back as far as I'd like. In addition the learning curve is fairly steep and unforgiving. This wouldn't be so bad except play is ONLINE ONLY. There's no skirmish mode against a computer, it seems like an obvious thing to add, but they didnt. You can only play this game against other players. So in my experience you either get absolutely trounced by people who have their strats down, or you trounce a new player.In addition since it's a newer game, you have to wait for a match to be made, yesterday that took eight minutes. 8 minutes of sitting in a queue staring at a loading screen isn't the most fun when I just want a 20-30 minute game.There is a single player 'TD' version of the game, but it's not the real game and feels tacked on.Ultimately I would say give this a pass just because of the online pvp only unless you're REALLY into this style of game."
,Recommended,214360,13021225,"Posted: 20 November, 2014",all,[Dr] VirtuouZz-OPN-,"Review Score: -6.75/10- As of Nov. 21, 2014. 'Simple n' quick to play, Very Challenging, Complex Tower Defense.'Summary: The game is easy to pick up, but as soon as you hit mission 2, things become very hard. This is the make-or-break it point of the game it seems. Because of it's startling difficulty it usually steers people away at this point. Why? Because unlike a standard Tower Defense game, it's not only about how well you build your defenses (To prevent enemy from gaining battle points) but also how well you form your assaulting force (To gain battle points). Once you get this idea, the game becomes pretty easy, and then turns into a true TD middle-to-late game(The end of the match).Pros:- Easy and familiar mehcanics (of a TD game)- Complex learning as time goes by.- Fun and addicting - Easy to forget time.- Very Challenging Campaign Mode.- Very Challenging PVPs/Versus players.- Co-Op works, and multi-co-op works.- Sticks to familiar roots of a traditional Tower Defense, and ingeniusly making it complex, and hard.Cons:- Hard learning curve at Mission 2.- No Tutorials on how to ""combo""- No Tutorials on ""Soldier to Tower ratio""- Difficult to play past mission 3-4.- Every second counts, and quick ""Analyzing"" required to deploy towers properly, due to Mines being randomly generated (Which forces different paths).- Very rarely, but has happened twice to me; a randomly generated Mine will block an entire section out (Making that entire area useless to you/or out of range = Very bad start-up/random generation that will give you a disadvantage that entire match).Ending Conclusion; This game is worth the play - Perhaps better if you waited for a sale. Despite these shortcomings; If you're looking for an Advanced Tower Defense game, this is exactly it. And if you're looking for a Co-Op Tower Defense, this game is still the game you're looking for. And if you're looking for a Tower Defense game that is harder than every other tower defense game.. This is still it. Because of those reasons I recommend this game - As no other game has proven worthy of the ""Most challenging Tower Defense"" Game as of yet, and this one holds true to it's core Tower Defense roots, whilst shoving out the ""Easy to pick up, very hard to master"" Kind of game.-V."

If you like competitive multiplayer tower defense, it's perfect. Very well done. Unit and tower variety, good ""talent tree"" system, gameplay is smoth and bug-free. Also family-friendly if that's important to you.My only complaints with the gameplay are the zoombots are a little too strong if you rush them early and the games aren't as fast-paced as I'd prefer, but no big deal. Also the tower system is a little strange, attacking shields first, then armor, then health. Since you have to build crossbow towers for first towers, that means mid-late game you must sell the weaker crossbow towers near entry to replace with the electric and canon towers first, then place your crossbow towers after that. Otherwise you won't deal damage effectively.*Note: The multiplayer is dead nowadays. Only good against the AI bot or if you have a friend to create a private 1v1 match with. My friend and I will still do some occasional 1v1 duels on this game. It's too bad because if they released new content and updates and kept the multiplayer alive, it could have been amazing."
