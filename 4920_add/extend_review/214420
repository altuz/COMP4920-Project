76561197995238758,Recommended,214420,14436598,"Posted: 11 February, 2015",all,Hobb_Bomb,"Alright, I was pleasently surprised with this game so here's teh simple breakdown:Pros:-Fun, fast paced style of gameplay. Death results in a few short seconds and you drop back onto the field.-Style/Attitude works well, its heavilty stylized to not look too realistic nor too cartoony. Its a little whimsical and I personally like that. It doesnt take itself too seriously and therefore is an easy pick up and learn to play sort of game.-Decent variety of parts, game types, etc.  You can build just about anything you'd like and play in a usual range of PvP game types, Deathmatch, with or without teams, capture the point. There may be a couple others I'd forgotten about but its all very standard.-The tank controls are difficult but not too stupidly hard. They require some getting used to, but they make kills feel earned and skilled. One of a short list of PC titles I chose to play using keyboard and mouse rather than my xbox controller.Cons:-Pay to win; If you dont shell out the $20 price tag you have to earn your tank parts and customizations like in a normal game. Thats fine with me, but if you DO spend the money, every part in the game is instantly unlocked. There do not appear to be any game breaking destructive weapons that allow you to dominated if you have them, however the spirit of the game ruined by the random matches full of folks who spent the cash and have the best tank they could design.-This means you better play with friends to have fun. Now I'm not saying you cant pick this game up and play against randoms and not have a good time. However logging in with a group of pals and building machines of war and playfully blowing eachother up is way better.-The Host system is a little bit... not good. Its the usual idea, when you are in the lobby you can click a button to invite your list of friends. The problem is that it checks them off so you cannot resend the invite if there is an issue. And there were issues. A couple instances where players did not recieve the invite and the only fix was to back out and start a new room. There also is no 'ready up' system where the host can launch the game for everyone. Everyone in the lobby has to hit their respective 'start game' button before anything happens. Not game breaking, but clunky.Final thoughts:Yes. Download the free version, skype with some friends, and start building your tanks. It was absolutly worth the time and effort put in and was a lot of fun. I may even pay for the basic package that grants you extra colors to paint your tank in and unlimited storage so I can collect more than 9 parts at a time. The game looks good, feels good, and has some degree of depth to it that I enjoy (Like using a spider tank to clamber clumsily up the wall to avoid my enemies)."

,Recommended,214420,19222844,"Posted: 22 November, 2015",all,ShyShade,"It's hard to find a game that really scratches the itch in want of a multiplayer shooter in the customizable mech/robot niche genre. Too often do games rub you the wrong way, ruined by pay-to-win features (MWO + many others), too much customization allowing ugly player builds and unfixed bugs (Robocraft), or glaring balance issues and console exclusivity (Armored Core). Then there are other games, like Hawken, that hold a ton of promise, but the developers give up and change hands.Gear Up is an endearing indie game that does its best to maintain balance and fun, and avoids pay-to-win. While Gear Up is a bit casual, and still in development, I have to say it is the closest game I have found to really enjoy and come close to scratching that itch of finding a solid mech shooter."

Back when I only have around 20 games here in Steam. This is one of my most played game. And I installed and uninstalled a lot of games. But I never did uninstalled this one. It has this kind of feeling that makes you say ""Let's go for one more round"". And I really love the simplicity of it.Edit: it appears the game has been updated and I love the fixes. The only stuff this game is missing are more maps, mutators, a scoreboard (what are the kill counts and assist for if you can't compare it with the others), and they should also make it so that when you target a player, you'll see not only their name but their rank as well. It would help!"
,Recommended,214420,23591561,"Posted: 15 June, 2016",all,Elusive Kat,"I am recommending this game 2 years after its release. Even now, it is fun to play with the various hulls and turrets to take down anyone in your path.Pros:Well designed gameFun to play with friendsAwesome combinationsChallenging multiplayer battlesCons:If you dont start out in private matches with friends, you will die nearly immediatelyDisbalanced in-game matches (any level can join)Slow gear upgradesOnly partially optimizedYou have to pay to get infinite slots if you want all the gearWays to get rid of Cons:Start playing with friends, then move to random multiplayerMake private matches with friendsBuy premium or basic dlc (premium better)Lower graphics settings, then it runs smooth(Not really a bypass to this, but its not a pay to win)Overall Review:Although this game needs a bit more optimization and balancing, you can be a top player within days of playing. I think this game is more suitable for 5-10 friends (including yourself) to play together to have more fun. I do wish the game had certain restrictions on ranks for joining online matches, because my first few matches i was lucky enough to be put on a 6+ rank team against 1-5 rank team (rookie team) so I gained more money than i probably should have to start. Premium Gear Up is a good DLC game. I recommend this to anyone who wont ragequit, but rather be patient whenever they die, but they will have to learn to accept that losing is a major possibility.8.5/10 would die again.P.S. This is my first review, is it good?"

The customization in this game is fantastic but the only thing I would say is that the weapons and turrets ect should all be more balanced out because at the moment you could have four extremely overpowered guns on the same tank or two turrets with four side weapons attached. A good way to get around this would be to make certain weapons more powerful if you only have one weapon or do the opposite by decreasing the damage of the weapons if you have about three turrets. Also, some of the weapons are much more powerful than other so I would recommend give the weapons there own pros and cons like in TF2 for example, but the game is still in alpha anyway so it will probably get balanced out later. A few bugs and glitches like when you try to snipe with bug legs the camara spazzes out but like I said before, the game is still in alpha and the bugs will probably get fixed.Overall I think that this game is fantastic and I highly recommend that you download it. :-)"
,Recommended,214420,22919393,"Posted: 11 May, 2016",all,Metronome (Derill),"Gear UpGear Upis a wonderful little FPS game with ongoing development.The P2W ClaimsI think I should probably get this out of the way first.Some people apparently get the impression that the game is P2W. It's really not.Unlikegames true to P2W where you can recklessly spam in-game premium upgrades or keep throwing money until you win, all buying the basic and premium packages does is give you the ability to save 3 vehicles, unlimited storage, and access to all parts. It doesNOThave direct in-game premium currency purchases that give players an unfair advantage.The game does not even have an option for microtransactions.I don't even know where these accusations come from.No matter how much money you lob, you still need to play good to be good.While the access to all parts is questionable, no game-effecting part should take more than 10 game rounds to get, and that's assuming you lose half of them. You can get one of the most expensive ones in just 2 rounds! Meaning after about an hour or two of decent playtime (with a bit of luck), you'll have the tank that you can use for the rest of the game.This is, of course, excluding the fact thatthe basic tank is actually a decent glass cannonthatstillmanages to kill meThe GameplayThe gameplay is probably about what you'd expect from a game like this, thankfully the tank treads don't use tank controls. Gear Up is a (mostly) team-oriented FPS, with four main gamemodes: Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch,Control PointsConquest, and Tag. The first two are self-explanatory, and Conquest is king of the hill with multiple ""hills"". Tag forces you to join the person who kills you until you've unified the entire server!Your tank controls similarly to a car when using certain wheels in that it can turn only whilst moving, with others like a proper tank able to turn in place, and whilst using more exotic options such as the slimeball or spider legs, you're able to strafe side to side and move diagonally.Each server has a cycling selection of 3 maps. When the previous match is won, it moves on to the next map. After the third, it restarts from the first, allowing hosts to pick their favorites.The BuildingUnlike some may initially expect, this game doesn't actually allow you to put blocks or pieces together manually. You've got a chassis, a propulsion, a turret, your weapons, and decorations.there's a pinwheelTheChassisis what holds your tank together. You can go with a bulky armor to absorb hits, or a light chassis to get around fast! There's also the more exotic chassis types, like Twin which gives you two turrets!Propulsionvaries wildly. Outside of the normal treads and tires, you can also make your tanka unicycle!a hovercraft, spider mech, or analienunicycle!Next up, theTurretis what holds your gun on your tank. I didn't actually expect to see something like this, and it definitely adds a layer of strategy I didn't expect. Will you go for the light turret, or the fast one? The slow and armored turret, or the double-weapon one?You've got two types ofWeapons, and up to four of each. ThePrimary Weaponshave varying utility, from pure DPS to long range or firing over or around obstacles. You can't fire two of the same weapon at the same time, and you can't use a primary while another one is reloading. TheSupportcan do just about anything. You can become lighter with an Antigravity Device, equip an auxillary Machine Gun, maybe some Speed Boosters or Wings? You can even take flight with Lawnmower Blades!Graphics and SceneryFor the most part, the game looks amazing. It manages to keep a cartoony look while looking realistic, in a way that's hard to describe. The tanks are bright and vivid in the landscapes of ruined bio-domes and ancient constructs. The game also manages to keep somewhat of a futuristic setting whilst still keeping it modern looking (excluding Oasis), as suits the tanks, with varying weapons such as the bronze-age cannon, to the tesla bouncer.MusicThe game is sparse in its music, but what it has, I like a lot. It uses an orchestral soundtrack with some electronic instruments at both the title screen and the last 30 seconds of a match. Mid-match, there is no music most of the time, except for the taunt of the Disco Ball (my personal favorite)ConsUPDATE: They've fixed almost all of the crashes. For the last two weeks I've played, I haven't crashed once. Also, my issue with the Desecrator appears to have been a bug, and is now fixed. Cheers to the devs!There's a nigh inescapable issue of unbalancing. This happens to all PVP games, really. There's always something.cannon heavyThe game's performance on lower end computers can be questionable in high-player matches, especially with thelag cannonScavenger involvedLastly, sometimes servers can lag while connecting, causing it to stall for more than 30 seconds.Cheating?Well, I'm not going to say cheating is nonexistant, but it'srare. I've encountered one or two cheaters throughout my hours in the game, but take what you hear about cheating with a grain of salt; Heavy tanks moving around fast can be easily accomplished with speed jets and snipers can dish out a lot of damage at any range - And there's still lag to account for ontop of that, as well as the fact that recounts of a situation can be biased - Someone can say something to make someone look bad and get them banned purely because the person keeps killing them and they don't like it.My ThoughtsThis game is great. It's got so much going for it.If you're still reading then play this game. It's free. I have lost sleep over it. I lost sleep writing this review.

,Recommended,214420,13970060,"Posted: 13 January, 2015",all,constantcompile,"This game has no microtransactions.Stats-wise, there is absolutely no difference between unpaid and paid players. Every part can be unlocked by unpaid players. Making a one-time purchase(!) for Basic makes them unlock faster and Premium unlocks them all. The paid versions also allow you to save vehicle loadouts.The mechanics of the game are very impressive. The trade-offs between mobility, defense, speed, stability, and offense seem very well thought-out, although I wish they were better communicated in the buying menu.Strategy and driving skill play a huge part in this game. Lighter, nimbler vehicles can literally drive circles around heavier opponents, such that the heavy turrets won't rotate quickly enough to keep up, and projectile travel time means that dodging enemy fire is entirely possible at long range. Powerups can quickly tip the scales in favor of players that remember to grab them, and using cover effectively, especially with weapons that have slow rates of fire, can make a world of difference in terms of survivability.In short, this is a fun, ten-minute vehicle brawler with lots of depth and none of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t that plagues many F2P titles.

76561198056188695,Recommended,214420,30939337,Posted: 4 April,all,TheDazok,"My first review ever... This is going to be difficult...Whatever, I'll just write what I think about the game: It's amazing.I love this game for a couple of reasons:-The first being the customisation, which is very well done, in my opinion. Obviously there are still parts that need to be tweaked slightly,  but most of the parts are reasonably well rounded, for what they are. This also means that there is no ""perfect tank"". There are tanks that can perform well in a couple of situations, but no tank is very effective against everything. If you want the correct tank for yourself, you have to keep playing and patiently find out, which design suits you best, like I did.-The second is that this game isn't pay2win, despite the premium pack unlocking all available parts (I bought the premium version when I had about 200 hours in the game, btw). One could build my massive ""Hunter"" tank, just from owning the free version, it would just take a bit of playing and learning. And speaking of ""learning"", the game is easy to get into, but it's very hard to master, because of the thousands and thousands of build combinations.-The gameplay is fluid, very enjoyable and the pace of it depends solely on your skill-level and you tank-design, which is something that I found a very good thing. Most games I played, I had the feeling that the game forced a certain design choice above others (aka. meta game), but not in this game.-The graphic is quite enjoyable and the style is rather cute, although the day maps are a tiny bit too bright.The things I don't like about this game though is that some people in the game can be quite toxic, but to be honest, I've seen much worse in other games, like in Dota 2 and Starcraft 2.Also a few new maps would be appreciated.But overall, this game is one of the best FreeToPlay games, that I've played in a long time.9.7 / 10(Update)I thought that I maybe need to add some thing I didn't express last time:- There are bugs in the game, obviously, but none of them are game-breaking. There was a time when the game would crash every 20 minutes or so, but those times are long gone. The rest are either graphical bugs or people getting into unfortunate (but really hilarious) situations.- Remember when I said that there's no perfect tank? That no tank can perform well against everything? The same thing aplies for the maps. Some tanks simply work better on some maps, while failing on others. This adds another level of depth to choosing, how to build your tank.That's probably it for the review. Have a nice game."

It has a very arcade like feel but Its very inticate in the different builds and strategies you can use. The maps are developed for different styles of play as well. Some maps have 1 capture point that everyone is trying to get while other maps have up to 5. Some maps are full of tunnels and buildings to hide behind while others are wide open. Almost all tank builds are efficient at killing which gives it a nice balance.

,Recommended,214420,14802055,"Posted: 8 March, 2015",all,Cirom,"A surprisingly good little tank-em-up focusing on fast-paced action. One particularly neat thing I like about the game is that the parts you start off with with your starter tank.. aren't actually the ""all-rounder"" parts, for once! The starter gear is some of the fastest and lightest in the game, which is an interesting touch. (Although, first thing I'd say to a new player, upgrade that cannon, pronto.)Another thing I really love about this game, it's not Pay to Win. At all. I've only spent about ~4 hours playing this game and haven't (yet! ;D) purchased the Basic Pack.. and yet, I can afford all the most expensive gameplay-modifying tank parts out of the Gold I earned during matches - the most expensive I've seen being ""The Beetle"" for 15G. For the record, you earn a minimum of 3G for a match victory, or 1G for a match loss - with +1G for every 10 enemies defeated and +1G for every 5 control points captured in Conquest mode. A good 8 matches and you can afford that Beetle. (Unless you're absolutely boss and win EVERY match ;U)The only problem I have with this game currently is the weapon balance. In it's current state, snipers and gatling weaopns seem a bit TOO powerful at the moment (especially gatling cannons, which seem to have the accuracy of a sniper rifle, for some reason!) That, and the hull which allows a player to equip two turrets seems to have no drawbacks, considering that each turret has a weapon AND two Support Sockets. (My suggestion? Remove the two Support Sockets on the extra weapon! That's the Assist's specialty, not the Twin's!) -- I've seen some tanks using the Twin hull dealing ludicrous DPS for the sole reason that the hull gives 2 weapon slots and 4 support slots in total.

Gear Up has multiple major flaws, but its just so fun.First off, the game's pros. Gear Up has addictive qualities and getting that ""one more armor peice"" is always fun. The currency doesn't require real money, and you'll have enough for any peice after 4-5 rounds.pros:Amazing gameplayVisually appealing art stylefairly balanced pvpEasy to earn currencyNow we have the cons. My first problem is that after buying premium, there is no goal. Nothing to unlock. I find the game is more fun not even buying basic, as it means you have to figure out exactly what parts suit you. The second problem is that this game's graphics aren't all that, which is a good thing for me and my 2010 HP pavillion computer, however, this makes it more frustrating that the game is way to laggy. For me and a lot of other people, the only way to play is to minimize the screen and set the graphics as low as possible. I find it wrong that a game with meh graphics requires a gaming computer to even be played full screen.Cons:premium rips away any goal you hadthe game cant manage itself and the game is just way too slow for its level of graphicsyou will ocassionaly fire 4-5 rounds at a tank, not kill it, and have it spin around and one shot youyou will have your tank randomly explode after being sniped from across the map.there isnt any apparent turrets that let you have more than 2 support items.This game is free and fun, plus it only takes ten minutes to download, so i reccomend at least trying it out."

The game goes by incredibly quickly because of so many of the propulsion systems. Sometimes you have to really think before you start an engagement because the enemy could be driving incredibly fast tanks or be sitting back and supporting their teammates. And for an early access game the bugs are minimal at best.Gameplay. As before stated, it honestly depends on who's playing and what they're playing. The 3 types of gameplay as either Conquest, Team Deathmatch, or Deathmatch can appeal to any kind of gamer also. Who doesn't like fighting for control points as friendlies around you get blown up by heavy resistance? If not, then go Team Deathmatch where you can kill more things and worry less about capturing points of interest. If Team Deathmatch is too soft for another person, then you have Deathmatch which is total war and all out free-for-all. Which personally is plain ridiculous when you have people with nuke launchers and dual rockets on their turrets coming around and one-shotting things. Makes it risky and incredibly fun. Not to mention the walker tanks that you will see if you haven't already. They're more suited to sniping since they can cling to surfaces and make the fighting more 3 dimensional instead of all out ground war. Instead of going in a linear direction with tracks or wheels, a player can actually discover alternate routes of getting into the fight. For example, someone with a set of walker legs could go underneath the fighting on Armed Arena and come out on the other side to get supporting fire on the enemy. However, some enemies aren't what they seem.Engine. The engine for this game is freaking awesome. It runs great on my crappy computer and puts out an average of 76 fps over an hour. What makes it even better is that the engine is from in-house. Meaning that the people who made the game made the game engine. But there is a pretty bad glitch with it when running that happens(more on that later).Buying Gear Up. The packs for this game? Totally unnecessary. The premium pack? Incredibly unnecessary. I started playing this game without anything purchased to get a feel for everyone else that did the same. And to be honest, you don't have to have ANY parts to be MLG pro at this game. It comes down to what a player has been accustomed to and how they would prefer to play. The stock tank is a great one. It's fast, has great damage output, and has a decent amount of hp. In the right hands it is capable of shreking any other tank on the battlefield and shaming prem users like me. I know this because I did it, and then have it happen to me. And before I'm asked, NO. I was NOT asked to advertise for this game but because it's free to play and since there aren't any ads, buying either of the packs supports the developers a ton. Every bit counts, and if anyone wants to see the change they want, then buy the basic pack.Bugs. There are a few sport-spoiling bugs that I've seen and they truly do ruin all of the fun while in-game. While playing the game I found out that there is some sort of exploit being done with the elephant chassis that allows the player to take any sort of damage and not actually lose armor points. I'm not sure how it's done but fighting an unkillable enemy that can(and will) kill you back makes you feel a bit tense. For the premium players, and possibly basic and unpurchased pack players too, while in the middle of a battle you can resupply your ammunition by changing any part on a tank while in the build menu. And also switch between any tank while in position without respawning(I know because I found this one). There are also issues with changing the graphics settings, and that when they are changed causes the game to crash. And then the run-time error with C++. I haven't been having the freqency of game crashes like said in other peoples' reviews but it does happen, and I have to force close the application through task manager before I can run it again.Overall Score. I'd give this game an 7.5(pretty great). I'm being pretty picky here because of the game breaking glitches but at the same time easy because of the game being in the baby stages of alpha. I'm glad that this game exists because it's given me a great amount of fun, and shows AMAZING potential. Add some new parts, fix the glitches, and you'd have an awesome f2p game.Me.

What i got was one of the BEST f2p tank games EVAARRR!every single peice of equipment has a use (other than deco). The Physics are amaziing (the heavy cannon could drop less though), and the controls are nice and fluid. one thing i LOOVE about this game is the spider legs. you can climb walls. while there ARE a few ... kinks... , 'nuff said. there are 4 ""propulsion"" types : Wheels, Treads, Hover-thingys, and legs. they all serve different purposes and are all good in their own respect (but i prefer Beatle Legs). there are 3-4 teirs in each, all increasing in their respected skill. Treads are the most Balanced. Wheels are the fastest. Floaters are good at dodging ground obsticles and are highly manuverable (and float above death water), and spooder legs are tank legs. In terms of weapons, the game has quite a few, but some seem repetitive.(NOTE: i havent tryed all the weapons) The tanks consist of 5 main components : Cannon, Turret, Hull, Propulsion, and a ""support"" item. support items range from buffs to secondary guns.there are things like stealth, speed, and health boosts. enough about this tanks. Gameplay is smooth, nuff said there. this game is an amazing free 2 play because it doesnt push people to buy the ""full"" version.the only thing it gives you from buying it is saving loadouts, unlimited part storage, more colors, and a slightly higher pay from battles.that seems like alot, considering the more money thing, but the most expenseive items in the game are 15 G (the games currency). You get 1 G just for participating in battles, as long as you finish them. You get 1 G per 10 Kills, 1 G per 5 tower captures in conquest mode. but the most moeny comes from winning. first place gets you an extra 3 G, 2nd gets you 2, and 3rd gets 1.so say i got 11 kills, and came in first on a FFA DM. thats 1 for participating, 1 for 10 kills, and 3 for first place. 1+1+3= 4G. In other words, GET THIS GAME ITS FREE AND FUN!!! 8/10 (when playing F2P), 9/10 Payed."

I'm not really into these random indie games either, but a friend was playing it and I asked how it went. I was told try it. So I did.Minimal download of 700MB. The graphics are simplistic and detailed, yet cartoonish like TF2. My 660ti powers through it at ultra settings on a 1900x1200 display. I would imagine it'd run acceptabbly well on some low-ended machines.Game play? Have you ever played Unreal Tournament (2003/2004/UT3) or TF2? You'll catch on quickly.Three modes: Hold the point, Team DM, and DM/FFA. All are self explanitory once you start playing.Physics IS used in this game. Dont expect some top-heavy tank build to not roll over. It will!Who wouldnt want a spider tank? This alone is incredibly amazing for the vomit inducing disorientation using it makes. Hanging up-side-down while popping off a few tanks is quite impressive.I was surprised when I was rewarded for playing a match with XP and Credits/Crowns despite loosing the match. You're not forced to be a try-hard. Even the casual can get in and have some fun.Now some Cons:-No single player or Tutorials. It's all trial by fire.-UI needs a bit more work when building your tank.-Need explinations of each part and how they fit together.-Crashes fatally after a few rounds with a runtime problem. I hope they fix this.-8 maps. They get old fast.-Premium purchase gives you 100% unlocks. Meh...-Flame weapons are brutal-Maps are too small and too much water!Final thoughts:It's a really well ballenced game.

76561198123746755,Recommended,214420,32412650,Posted: 14 June,all,Ms.Spooks,"This is a pretty good game with lots of perks. I've been playing this game for 50 hours without buying the 29.99 premium pack. So if you're concerned about this game being pay to win, you have nothing to worry about. In less than 3 games that take 10 minutes you will already have enough for a new part. The credits are easy to earn and parts are fairly cheap.I did end up buying the basic pack however. Not becuase I had to but because it made the game much more enjoyable. While you get a slight advantage over people who are free to play in the access to 3 quick slots to save 3 diffrent builds. I say advantage because it saves a significant amount of time from switching items out.The next reason I bought the basic was you have unlimited item storage. This isn't a necessity by any means. Your storage increases with your rank and really it takes a while before you max out your parts. All the parts themselves are easy to collect completely free.The gameplay itself is very solid actually. The parts are pretty well balanced for the most part. For example, if you want to use a missle launcher over a heavy cannon you'd trade 5 damage for slightly faster firing speed and a diffrent type of projectile. Or if you want to use 6 wheels instead of the tracks you get less weight and slightly better max speed. There are a lot of turrets and hulls though that in my opinion are a waste of space so bear that in mind.As other posters have said the autoblance is a little funky where red team always gets the first person. This creates some very unbalanced games naturally. Since you can leave the current game without penalty there are *some* players who leave the game. Putting you at a further disadvantage. However this has never been a huge problem for me at least as the cases the games get terribly unbalanced is few and far between.The maps spawns are a little obnoxious at times. There seems to be a trend where when someone spawns alone the enemy team waits to spawn on top of them, all at once. This makes some skirmishes very unfair becuase it feela like the second you spawn you'll have to fight for your life. However it's only in deathmatch and team deathmatch game modes. In the other game modes it's a lot less of a problem in my opinion.The controls are difficult to get at first. Once you start having a few hours under your belt though it starts getting much easier to control yourself without spinning out. How you can move really is versitile in you can climb on walls, hover over water, or just roll around. In some builds jumping, hovering, and to some degree gliding can be fun to catch people off gaurd.The game is very stylized in a good way. It has both cute and cool attributes that make it visually nice to look at. The game is also fairly good looking full optimized as well so if you play on a toaster like I do than you'll not have to worry about it looking like a pixelated discolored mess. However there seems to be some kind of bug internally that does create massive frame drops. I'm sure in time it will be fixed.The map designs themselves range from really enjoyable to wanting to stab yourself with a dirty spork. I'm talking of course about 2 maps in particular which happen to be water levels. This forces ryou to either drive around obstacles in a small path to fall off and drown if you're not careful OR use the hover parts to get across water safely. The other major water map is just a giant putting people on top of the hill at a huge advantage. Now forcing you to either use legs to climp annoying walls or hover to sit on the bottom. While some of the maps are boring at first they really grow on you overtime. For example there is a map that is built more like a king of the hill game mode while everything else is just hills and empty space. At first it seems boring but once you get the hang of movement you'll appreciate the simplicity. The maps are very diverse from each other but there are so few you start getting a little bored of them.Overall I like this game. It's fun, charming, and a little nutty. I feel like it needs more dynamic part choices though to extend potential play styles. I also would like playing support to be more rewarding to do. Seriously you only get an achievement for playing medic, but get bonus points for getting more kills. Some of the hulls and turrets also need slight rebalancing to be more viable as they're great in concept but poorly executed. Once you kind of see the major meta builds, you start realizing how few options there really are for actual parts/non weapons/non support. Also for how high some of the maps can be having a max aiming hieght can get really annoying sometimes.I suggest this game becuase dispite its faults and shortcomings it really is a solid choice to play for a while. It's easy to get caught up in playing the game before realizing just how many matches you've played. Playing around with new builds to find what works is very enjoyable as well. Solid gameplay, visually good to look at, and overall an 7.8/10 from me. It would be higher if the game had more maps, parts, and gamemodes. would like to see some king of the hill or payload style games."

Finding matches is fast.The deal breaker: This game crashes constantly. All the issues with this game are outside of gameplay. Which is good, maybe they will eventually get fixed. The game crashes when loading a map, at random times while on the map, while changing graphics options, when you spawn, when you die, when returning to the menu, when clicking through the menu. It can literally crash at any moment. I've tried restarting my computer, restarting the client, reinstalling the client.The game also appears to have a memory leak. It starts at around 450MB usage in the menu, 460MB while in a map, then over time goes up to 2GB usage while in the menu.. Probably higher if you can go long enough without crashing.Other thoughts: There is no party system, and the ""invite friend"" system is broken. It's still easy to find friends in matches. I don't mind not having parties, I like playing against my friends as much as I like playing with them, this is a positive in my mind.TL:DR____________Fix the crashes and I'll give this game a solid recommendation. The gameplay really is there for a fun way to blow off some steam and mess around. But it causes as much frustration as it lets out at the moment."

Though it's a free-to-play, we both own the base game now, and I definitely don't regret it. Gear Up offers fast-paced multiplayer ground-based robot combat with a neat parts-based customization system that allows the player to create an immense variety of shooty zoomies; from the wheels, to the body, to the weapons, there's a lot going on, especially as far as the latter is concerned; there are many weapon types and nearly as many available as secondary weapons to plug into the sides of your turret. WIthout getting too into it, it has it's fair share of options to satisfy most tinkerers.As of right now, the game modes are a little predictable; matches are either team deathmatch or ""domination"" which probably works exactly how you would imagine. I did not, however, find this to be particularly troubling; the game has a BEAUTIFUL art style to accompany its interesting enough level design; at no point have I found the matches to be boring.There are a handful of games that play exactly the same right now in this genre. I, personally, have played a ton of Robocraft and absolutely love that game, so I was worried that this title might not be for me: worried that it might be too simple. I was happy to find that although the games are similar, Gear Up has enough going on for itself in terms of aesthetic and style where it stands on its own as a playable and FUN moon-and-zoom shoot-and-scoot."

If i'm a bit bored, or there are a lot of new players abroad, I tend to go basic tank, and I still tend to rek some scrubs, because when compared to some other typical layouts the basic (scout) tank is pretty good. So don't always see someone using some big fancy gun and go ""Wow, if I start using that, I'll be that good"", cuz that ain't it sugar. Just practice with what you have and then try one new thing, don't always buy something just because you think it'll make you ""better"".The people you meetThere are several types of people in this game that you will meet quite quickly, not all are as nice, or as helpful as I can be.First, the ""Basics"" as I call them, people you know just started, either based on rank or the parts they have. Typically consisting of all scout but one part or two, and usually using a machine gun or heavy cannon, they are usually high health but really slow and don't know what they're doing (they pick some big heavy body thinking that it will keep them alive, heh, if only it were that easy).There are the snipers, all shapes and sizes, from the flying ones that have just enough health to not get one hit by heavy snipers, the fast little ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s with no health at all, or the spiders that get somewhere cheesy and pick off basics, they all can get very annoying, but luckly it only takes one or two hits with something higher damage to destroy them.The Heavies, the big ones with like 300+ health and a lust for explosives and fast bullets, not fairly common, but they can ruin your day.The Gunners, fast guys with around 100 health and a need for speed, along with a passion for machine guns, they tend to zoom in F*** S*** up and run off for health and ammo, they are the type to rely on weapons as their skill, and don't confuse them with harpooners and lazer'ersHarpooner/lazer.. erThese type are pretty simmilar to the Gunners, except they actually have some decent skill, they tend to use the harpoon gun[s], or the vintage laser and assorted secondaries, which require pinpoint accuracy, and a steady freaking hand (with how fast they go, they need to account for their movment, your movment, obsticals, and gravity with the harpoons), and if they are as good as I make them out to be (and usually they are) they will kill you... again and again.The MapsWell there isn't much to say, there are several maps, some with optional night time, and most of them are pretty cut and clear, the open ones are fun for snipers and slower based combat, the duck and cover ones are better if you like quick kills and nasty 3+ person skirmishes, and the skate park ones are for some sick moves and rad jumps... bruhYou can pick three at a time when making a game and so long as someone is in the game it will keep cycling the three indefinitly, but there is no G coin/exp gain from just you in a match, even if you have a score, but someone leaves, you wont get any gain (sorry for you farming type)Health, ammo, and power ups, oh myThe three aformentioned things are found everywhere on maps (almost redundanly so), and are pretty simple, health packs give you 25 health, ammo packs refill ALL ammo (every single gun and secondary, even if empty will totally refill), power ups have two effects, blue shields will reduce damage taken by 1.5X and visa versa with red rockets (yeah I have no clue where they pulled that idea from, damn swedes) will increase your damage by 1.5X, and if combind you get a fun purple...y glowWeaponsWell, I figure you can guess what that means, there are several type, lets delve themBullet/laser GUN, run o' the mill machine guns, with a quick travel time and low to fair damage (this includes the description of the lasers that fire like a gun) and really good reload timesSnipers/laser BEAMS, instant travel time, fair to INSANE damage (up to 113 with the desecrator and 1.5X dmg) but nil on reloadShotty/fireFlame throwers, and the shotgun, oh god, what can I say, MASSIVE damage over short time, but no range, pick something fast nimble and good god make sure you can turn fastMissleThe ole' standbye, whether lobbed or launched they do good damage, have a range of decent to F*** all short, but deals decent to insane damage, and has really good reload times for the damageSo wrap up anyone?It is a easy to pick up, hard to learn, impossible to master game of goofy tank battles and endless mayhem.

There are no tutorials, not bot matches to learn on, you just get in the game and, pray to RNGesus that you get people that suck as bad as you.Anyways I've always loved the idea of multilegged platforms, plus the ability to strafe and climb walls sounded great, so I chose to go with those as my first upgrade.The multi-legs are garbage, there is no good sense of direction with them and, the wall climbing abilities are ruined by the camera. Not all surfaces are safe to climb on either, I was forced to respawn a few times because I had left the map... even though I was trying to climb a tower on the opposite side of the map (but was far enough from the border not to warrant a respawn).The first map I was on wasn't designed very well either. You're either sniper bait, or you get to run around a tunnel system and, pray that you have the higher DPS/better aim.When I actually went to play a legit match, the lobby took so long to load that I gave up."

It is not a really big game i should note. not that many maps and such, but it is still a lot of fun for short bursts and the graphics are pretty slick.That all aside... The F2P model isn't exactly fully F2P. if you play for free the game is pretty limited. eventually you reach a point where your inventory doesn't grow at a rate that is satisfactory. making the ""Basic"" pack very much needed if you want to collect all the parts. It isn't exactly expensive considering the fun you can have, but it is still odd.The ""Premium"" pack sits there is just bizzare tough. It is required if you want to play in ""Bot mode"", but also takes away all the fun of collecting all the parts the normal way.All around. this is pretty fun. It ain't big or something, but you don't need that with a chaotic arcade shooter like this.SLIGHT NOTICE:Game has a tendency to crash after a while. don't get too excited if a run goes well. it tends to crash then....Funny moments:-I was in a stealth sniper when i heard the sound of a enemy spawning on my location. i just stood still and the one even stopped next to me to snipe, i slowly turned my turret and blasted him."

Not much gamemode but it's really fun when you play with other players.Price: It's a free to play game but I bought the premium and it's absolutely worth the price: you'll get all the parts and even the parts in the future updates(There's no parts store section in the game anymore if you bought it).Also you'll receive some new gamemodes like offline bot game and bonus levels.Graphic: Not bad. I think graphic is not a big deal for multiplayer shooter games, just personal opinion.Maps: Easy to play, not too complicated. The last thing I want to say is that: Plz increase the health restore amount of the health packs and decrease the ammo restore amount of the ammo packs. I suggest health restore 50 health instead of 25 and ammo packs restore 75% of ammo instead of 100%.Any way it's a cool game and it's worth to spend time on it.

There is a conquest mode where you capture areas for a certain points income over time, but at the end of the day, you win faster by roaming around and killing every enemy trying to capture a point and then moving on, as that awards way more points if you are any good."

This game really needs to balance the team sizes. Most matches are played with uneven teams because the only way to balance the teams is for someone (on the team with more players) to quit and rejoin the match - which means that they lose all their xp that they had earned up to that point.2. Standing on certain surfaces (even flat surfaces) with Legs for propulsion will cause the camera to shake such that aiming is quite difficult.Overall I would recommend this game.

The pay system at the time I'm writing this seems to be fundamentally flawed. Basic gives you as many inventory slots as you'll ever need and it's easy to unlock tons of equipment just playing the game, however, I quickly stopped caring about my 'rank' and after getting a few parts and when I stopped a few days in I had roughly 80 of the 130 or so parts.  For what it is it has a wealth of content but you'll blow through all of it absurdly fast even with the basic package, if you have a premium account then it'll be lucky to last you a day.I'd recommend trying it if you're curious, but the game needs a lot of work before it'll be anything more than a flavor of the week sort of deal.PS. There are some latency issues with the game which could completely ruin your experience, though this seems to be hit and miss and not everyone will experience it as the matches are hosted via a peer to peer system."

,Recommended,214420,26169492,"Posted: 22 October, 2016",all,zwanglos,"An enjoyable tank-combat arcade-style game with light customization elements. Free to play, though I would recommend at least picking up the cheap 'Basic' pack if on sale to bypass the annoying 'limited storage for tank parts' feature of the F2P version (I can't remember if Basic also allows you to save up to 3 tank combinations, I think it might be the case). There is no P2W inherent in the game, only Pay2UnlockFast.This isn't a game that I take seriously enough to play for consistently long stretches of time, but one I keep coming back to occassionally. It's light fun, and its style makes it easy to just hop into matches and start blasting things with buzzsaws and coconuts. And thankfully even after a year post-release I don't have problems finding active matches with dozens of players.The customization is relatively shallow when compared to somewhat similar games like Robo-somethingsomething or whatever that was called. I think this will appeal to those who like tinkering around a little but really just want to blast things with harpoons and fireworks. If you're a more creative type who spends hours making their combat machines JUST RIGHT in an editor, and then testing it for 5 minutes to find out it actually sucks, so you back to the editor for another hour to make it JUST RIGHT AGAIN - well, the customization in this game will not appeal to you.You mix and match parts, but no tweaking with the parts. You mix propulsion+body+turret+weapon(s)/supports. There are enough different combinations to accommodate quite a few different playstyles: play a lurking cloak unit with high burst damage by equipping 'stealth' mods and waiting for your prey; grab spider-leg tracks and high-damage sniper rifles and pick off enemies from across the map while hanging upside down from a tower or the side of a wall; go very fast and punch hard if you're willing to sacrifice survivability for speed and firepower; be a healer; float over the water with long-range guns, making it hard for landlubbers to retaliate; put some jumpets and wings on and be a goofy hang-gliding tank with exploding coconuts if that's your thing (that's actually a very fun one, I've tried it).Game modes are fairly standard-fare DM/TDM/point-control. Surprised there's no CTF, though I think the devs wanted to just have gamemodes that worked interchangeably on the maps they have, and said maps are overall a bit too small for CTF anyhow.I've not come across any highly organized teams in the game and AFAIK there aren't any - the gameplay doesn't really suit it, even in the team modes. Especially in TDM, you can basically spawn anywhere you want, which makes things very disorganized and hectic. The Control mode allows you to spawn at base or at any captured points, but is still hectic. And the maps are really small.Only thing that irritates me is the lack of maps in the game ... there are about 5 IIRC, split across the 3 modes. I think this contributes to why I don't play for extended stretches of time, because it does get a bit repetitive on just 5 maps."

First, I love this game. I enjoy the mechanics of moving with WASD and turning your turret head with the mouse, and the imagination and creativity that go into building your tank is fun and good to show of with your friends. Although there are a few bugs, it is a pretty clean game, espeicially for just coming out of early access. The only problem with the game is the limited replay value. I hear a ton of complaints about ""invisible snipers"" and ""overpowered tankers"", but I've only played the game for two days and have already found a tonload of ways to destroy the types of tanks, such as mortars and spider legs. Back to the topic, after playing the game for a long time, it gets boring if you use the same type of tank over and over again. If you keep changing your tank and PLAYING WITH YOUR FRIENDS (this is the best way to enjoy the game since killing or blowing each other up has an actual meaning) this is a game that many gamers would enjoy."

It is stress free and fun to play in small bursts, or in long grinds. Being a F2P game, there are no microtransactions that ruin the games balance or give people an unfair advantage. It is a very fair business model that I think more dev's should follow. You can only pay for more part slots in your storage, or to unlock all of the parts early. Even unlocking all of the parts early isnt an unfair advantage because it is possible to do well with the starter tank and the parts that you onlock early on. Parts dont scale to level, so it's not like some guns are more powerful than others. Guns just perform different tasks and accomodate different play styles. I get the feeling the devs want to earn you money instead of exploit you for it. Im thinking about paying for premium later just to make sure they get my support.Con's:There are some major bugs in this game.- Random crashes to desktop- Unable to change graphical settings without the game crashing and no changes being saved.- Some textures didnt load in for me in the parts store which proceded to crash my game a few times.- Unable to spawn on certain points on the map.- Screen freezes and connection issues- Possible invincibility bugAlso when you first start out, a lack of a good ranking system will frusturate new players. Someone who is just starting out with a starter tank will have to fight level 20 tanks who have more weopans and body styles unlocked, and will just have to deal with it until they unlock more tank parts. I dont know if it is something they can fix in the future, but every once in a while games will be one sided because of the discrpency between what players have unocked due to how long they have played. I however would blame not knowing how to play the game more than I would the parts because with some experience you can beat anyone with the starter tank pretty easily.Grade: B -It has some bugs that need fixed and some slight balance issues, but it is incredibly fun. I really do reccomend it even though it is a little rough around the edges right now. It's still in early access, so lets hope the devs contimue to improve the game and it doesnt become ""abandonware""."

(There's also DM, and some sort of Tag.... maybe another mode I'm forgetting).The gameplay is pretty straight-forward and simple, Drive around shoot people. You have a secondary fire and primary fire. There is one type of pick-up the fully replenishes both.  There's also Health and a type of Over-Shield pick-up.  There's a red rocket pick-up but I'm still not entirely clear on what it does. Simple fun gameplay.Where it gets interesting is customization. You earn points as you play , (always at least one point for participation per match, and then points for Kills, and base captures in certain modes, as well as points for the winner/ winning team).  I find you earn points at a very good rate, generous. You then use the points to buy new parts that change your tank in really fun ways I find.But there are countless parts so even with generous points it'll take a while to unlock them all. There are various types of ""Propulsions"" , Chassis, Turrets, Main Weapons and Support weapons. The propulsions alone have several types , each with 3 weight classes that determine speed and armor. Legs that stick to walls and ceilings so you can climb around, Hoverpads that let you drive on water (both of these let you strafe (with Q and E).  Then there's tank treads that can't strafe but still let you turn on a dime, and wheels for speed but no dime-turning.The weights vary in armor greatly, as well as speed. I never found an opponent way too armored up for me (a light fast tank) to kill. But in those scenarios I did have to use my speed to gain advantageous positions and avoid their attacks.I could go into more but I feel like this sums it up. Its simple, but creative and fun. I am having a blast playing it. And have yet to figure out how they make money in the game (???)"

While there is a pay system, it's used mostly to support the creators and unlock extra space, but also can give you instant access to the parts you would have to unlock otherwise.Other than a lack of Computer players, this game is a shining example on how a simple game mechanic can still lead to some great gameplay, and I look forward to any updates this title will give."

Very fast if you are in the mood, or slow down and hide/snipe.Lots weapons and equipment.  You dont need to pay to have fun.  I really like the conquest maps that are basically capture the flag games.    Nice visuals, very speedy gameplay and awesome guns.  The only negative I have is that there are sometimes not too many people online in my timezone.  This improves on weekends.   Play away this one is a winner!"

I don't recommend Premium, as it's a bit costy and doesn't have too many privelages other than instant access of weapons. Basic provides, and it helps the developer since this is a free to play game.Graphics are nicely made, gameplay is fun. I've played this a LOT at LAN parties.

The gameplay itself is fine, the community is fine, the pay for more colored and infinite space, fine (though questionable), it's the items that turned this down, especially the cost for all of them. They either need to add more points per match or and a large amount of weapons."

There's cheap metods to defeat enemies and serious metods to even defeat even the strongest devs. I've put like 6 hours in this game and even came along to streaming it back then, when i wanted to reach atleast 100 subs on yt. Cheap metods are like...idk...just gettin' spider legs and camping somewhere on the roof where nobody can reach? Maybe, just maybe. And serious metods are gettin some kinda thing that makes you invisible and so you appear in front of everybody, scare them so hard they sh!t themselves and kill em' in one shot.I remember back then i was using cheap metods to kill like the small dudes. Goin' under the maps with spider legs? Yea, that's an option. Like, jeez, you have millions and millions of selections of robots. Like what are you gonna do? Camp the whole match? Yea, that's what you're doing.11/10 Would camp again."

Whenever playing the game you encounter mostly the same tank builds, and an overall lack of diversity in the tanks built, which is a shame, as the customization in this game is very extensive. I would give this game an easy 4 out of 5 if the devs revisited the game, and encouraged diverse builds, instead of using the same easy-to-use, high damage items."

,Recommended,214420,31536786,Posted: 3 May,all,omony,"A nice casual shooter with a variety of different tactics and simple controls. Supports different strategies and regimes. So if you got bored with a simple tank, take a flying one. There are always players online - some experienced, some are not. Don't expect any deep tactics in this game, it's casual.It's balanced enough (if you play well) and free. With a free account you can progress, buy equipment with experience. After an hour of gameplay I've built a decent hover and became a moderate player. You'll have to invest at least an hour or two to gain support weapons and a faster/harder base - after that, you'll be equal with other players. There is always a tradeoff between something fast-fragile and slow-strong. Without any money you can built a single tank and change it with gaining more experience. With Basic account you can have multiple tanks - so if you enjoy leveling up, take Basic after a few hours of gameplay. I bought premium after 3 hours just to support the developers."
