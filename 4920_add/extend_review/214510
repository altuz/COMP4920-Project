The devs has done well to find a way to nearly-constantly trigger my brain's pleasure center (with rewards, sounds, and visuals) that I don't tire of playing it.I can safely recommend this title to gamers of all ages and skill-levels. :)Buy with impunity!"

I think this game is definitely a fun game even if there are annoyances to be found.The game uses audio from the movies, which is good and bad for me. The audio is well done and as always it is nice to hear those familiar voices, but it does kill the humor and creativity of a lot of the cutscenes. I wish they had went back to no audio for the voices.The character wheel in game is useful but can definitely be cumbersome as it becomes an extra step in getting to the full roster, which when you have a lot of characters of when free roaming is very important.The questing is crap to me. Making me go back again to other levels and get items is not fun, it is boring. This is a feature I think was fixed well in more recent Lego outings.The mythril equipment was very good and I think brought creativity to the game, especially with the musical shoes and the Disco Phial.Combat was so so, I actully thought fighting would be improved for a game like this but it was the same.Level design was done well and I think encapsulated those scenes very well. If not for the many game breaking glitches and the ability to somehow get 1 or 2 extra minikits or items over the limit effectively keeping you from reaching 100%.Overall I would recommend this game with a 7.5 / 10. The newer games have improved this formula but this one is left in that time between old and new."

You cover 6 missions per each of the 3 movies and they added more of an RPG feel with what they call fetch quests. The challenge is about the same as the other lego games, and many of the things that are pain are also here (switching camera angles that all of the sudden make ou walk in a different direction. The camera angles are still the thing I hate most.) . It takes about 10-12 hours to beat the game, but if you are going for the achievements, it will take over 50 hours. Many secrets areas in this game and as usual, excellent humor and very fun game play. Being a big fans of the movies, this game does the franchise proud. A must for lego game lovers."

I have played this off and on over the last couple years, lol....but that is no indictment on the game. Actually, my interest in both the topic and the LEGO aspect kept bringing me back, even though my gamer ADD often took hold. The humor added to a mostly dark adventure was perfect, and as somebody who knows the LOTR inside and out, I really appreciated all the subtle jokes and such. Often, they really said what a lot of fans were thinking. The gameplay itself is fairly standard LEGO game fare. Engaging and simple enough that anybody can pick up this game and play it through to its conclusion. I also like how they broke the game up into three books with credits at the end of each. That was appropriate IMO.The extras such as free roam and so on all are also what you would expect and could literally add countless hours to your game.My only complaint is that a played a couple chapters offline, and the game never synced those trophies afterwards, so it is kind of odd seeing my completion without some of the end of chapter achievements (like the Weathertop one for example).All in all, I would consider this a must own for LOTR and/or LEGO game fans. Very well done. Let's see, 16 rings of power out of 19 possible with one ring to rule them all."

I'd never played one of these lego games before, so I didn't know what to expect. What I found was a fun game with plenty of content taking a serious storyline and making it goofy as well....And yet this game frustrated me. Alot. For one, it's a terrible console port. There's no mouse support, so you have to do everything with the keyboard. I did manage to get through this, but it makes playing a little awkward. Worse for me is the platforming parts, where you have to jump around to reach hidden areas or to progress further in the levels. Trouble is the camera can be annoying with this, and it is far too easy to fall off ledges or into water, and then have to try again and again. I got seriously frustrated at a few parts, though ultimately I made it through. I'd call the platforming the worst part of this game.So it's a fun game with some frustrating elements. This is one of those cases where a ""maybe"" recommendation would be ideal, but ultimately I'll lean towards ""yes"" on this one because the good bits outweigh the frustrating bits. Have fun! :)"

The voice over and soundtrack are the same used in the movie trilogy. The're impeccable. The graphics are really nice. The characters models are, well legos.

This combined with the goofy humor really adds to the experience.Game play wise, the game is a collect a ton platformer that made me remember the good days of N64 and PS1 (Banjo-Kazooie , Crash, Donkey Kong, Spyro) with some basic rack and slash and puzzling. It's fun, but it hardly presents any challenge.My only criticism about the game are some 2 or 3 buggy platforming sections that were really annoying.

So when LEGO LOTR was on sale, I decided to pick it up for the nostalgia.PROS:- Classic LEGO gaming. Whacking foes, building structures, funny cutscenes, everything. Loved it.- Great level design. I never felt like I was playing reskinned levels. I've noticed that in a few games I played recently, but not in this one. Every level is different.- Every character can do almost everything!!! LEGO Star Wars needed certain characters for certain actions. LEGO LOTR allows any character to complete *almost* any action, using items.CONS:- Not as funny... LEGO Star Wars was laugh-out-loud hilarious. LEGO LOTR tries, but it just isn't as funny. There were only two or three cutscenes that I really laughed at.- Occasionally requires button-mashing. There were a couple of times where the game literally tells you to button mash. For minutes on end. Boring.- Too easy. LEGO Star Wars had a decent difficult curve, running around completing objectives. LEGO LOTR feeds everything to you.- Too many semi-cutscenes. Parts of the game where they show you what's coming up, but it isn't a full cutscene. They drove me crazy, since they're unskippable.- Custom characters need to have a cape? What's up with that??CONCLUSION:Felt really good to play a LEGO game again. Not quite as good as LEGO Star Wars, but still very well done. Some of the new abilities are great, and I really like being able play through a level with a single character, using only items to get through.FINAL RATING: 5/7"

So, suffice it to say that we have a lot of Lego games.  LLotR is not a bad addition to the franchise.  It's fun, they've added a lot of new functionality to the gameplay and it's a Lego game.  We both like the game quite a bit.  The one thing we do both agree on, however, is that the actual movie voice acting is weird at best.  We enjoyed all of the previous Lego games because the characters only grunted and made noises while explaining the plot.  This added quite a bit of humor and fun to the games as you would have to think about what they were basically acting out for you.  Now with the actual voice acting, the games sort of lose that playful sort of feeling.  Regardless, the game is fun, but I would still take many of the last Lego games over this one."

The puzzles are pleasurable and do not feel dumbed-down for kids because some of them can be quite tricky, especially in Free Play where you will have to utilise abilities of all characters in solving intriguing puzzles. I found jumping puzzles the most challenging. The camera in this game is quite clunky plus the horrible character changing mechanism making the game a bit frustrating at some points. The camera can be panned but I found the lack of mouse support a bit annoying. The cutscenes now have voiceovers taken directly from the films, which may seem strange at first, given that previous LEGO games were silent, but it makes the scenes more memorable. The slapstick humour is of very high quality, as is usual in Traveller's Tales' games. Even the scenes from the films that always made me cry obviously made me laugh. Howard Shore's soundtrack is very well edited into this game and is playing non-stop in the background making everything more epic/enjoyable. I only didn't like that they changed the iconic music playing during the ride of the Rohirrim, the last march of the Ents and the Gandalf's Eagles rescue at the end of all things.

,Recommended,214510,21391724,"Posted: 22 February, 2016",all,DAYVIS2NIVERSE GAMING AND REVIEW,"'One does not simply walk into Mordor'- BoromirWould anyone like to take a guess at what I just did?So, here I am, Dayvis2, reviewing this game that I purchased from Steam about a month or two ago while it was on sale for £3.74, which, seeing as the story alone has given me 12 1/2 hours of fun gameplay, is a freaking bargain! Anyway, here's my review.PLOTThe story follows the plot of The Fellowship of the Ring, The Two Towers and The Return of the King, using cutscenes with sound clips from the films and levels with some brilliant gameplay. There are 18 action-packed levels to play, each about 25-45 minutes depending  on how much time you like to spend fighting, collecting etc.GAMEPLAYYou can play as loads of different characters from Frodo to Tom Bombadil to an Orc. In the levels, it's obvious that there are some new features, such as Ring Mode, where you can enter the wraith world and discover new objects that only ring-bearers can make, along with horse rides including the frankly epic Ride of the Rohirrim in Return of the King. There are cooking puzzles that require collecting of items that are then put in a pan, and the ability to use the Palantir in both Film 2 and 3 in order to travel between Frodo and Sam's and Aragorn Gimli and Legolas's stories. There is also the Eye of Sauron to look out for when you finish Fellowship, because its sight will cover areas, blocking access until you play a certain level, after which the eye will shift to a different area. This is so you don't just play all of Frodo and Sam's journey and none of Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas's journey.OPEN-WORLDOne of the best bits is the Open World, a complete map of all the areas explored in the story. You can visit the stone trolls in the Trollshaws, sail down the Great River and then past the Argonath, walk into Mordor, complete quests, forge items and collect gold and red bricks. Areas you can explore include: Hobbiton, Bree, Weathertop, Trollshaws, Rivendell, The Misty Mountains, outside of Moria, Lothlorien, The Great River, Amon Hem, Fangorn Forest, Rohan, Isengard, Helm's Deep, Edoras, Dunharrow, Minas Tirith, Emyn Muil, The Dead Marshes, Ogsgilliath, Minas Morgul, The Stairs, Shelob's Lair, Cirith Ugnol, The Black Gate and Mordor! You'll be able to switch the world from day to night and back again when you've completed the story, and inbetween levels you'll be journeying through the land. I must say that I prefer some aspects of the Hobbit world more than this one (see my LEGO Hobbit review for more detail) because of Eagle travel and the different locations, but that's just my opinion.GRAPHICSGraphics are pretty good even with the medium settings I had to use on my seemingly ancient computer.OTHERThe game doesn't feel rushed, but some levels, such as the Caradhras level, do feel a little stretched out. I particularly like the main menu screen that has four different versions, one with a map of Middle-Earth for the very first one, another with Hobbiton for Fellowship, one with the alignment of Isengard and Bardadur for Two Towers and Baradur with Mordor for Return.CONCLUSIONThis is a great game that feels like an epic bargain if you get it on sale. The LEGO games do go on sale often, so try and grab this one quickly if you see it on sale! Still worth the money at the usual price, too though. All in all 9/10."

The storyline is condensed somewhat hitting all the major plotpoints so might not make a whole lot of narrative sense if you haven't seen the movies.If you've never played a Lego game before firstly I would recommend a controller, as they've predominantly been designed with consoles in mind. The main campaign will probably only take you around 9-12 hours but there is a good 18-20 hours of side content within the big open world hub map of Middle Earth if you enjoy the whole collect-a-thon type of gameplay.Be wary though that if you plan to play this game with friends (as Lego games are designed to be played) that there's only local co-op.

Nevertheless it uses very often the original voice acting from the movie. The combination works well. So play it in English for the original voices. The German edition has only new voices, no archive material from the dubbed films. That works also, but you do not get the complete LEGO movie feeling. The strong points are the new dialogues that wrap the story up and introduce minor changes from the original.The game is fun to play - especially in local coop, but it is not very different from any other LEGO game.

It´s a nice typical Lego game and quite fun to play, but at the same time it's so glitchy and buggy.After beating the game (few crashes, stuck in the wall stuff), I wanted to collect all the stuff left. During ""Attack at Weathertop"" I had a game crash. After reloading and completing the level from the checkpoint (everything collected, treasures in pocket), I recognized that I still had 0/3 treasures.After a little research I know now that this is a glitch that can occur in any level. Playing through the level one more time didn't help. Now the level is bugged, I can't it complete it anymore (I still have the treasures but they don't count and I can't pick them up again...). I can't even reload an older save because there is only one save. Shouldn't have played the level from the checkpoint after it crashed. It's always fun if a game forces you to do research beforehand to avoid gamebreaking bugs that can ♥♥♥♥ up your savegame..."

An excellent choice for casual couch coop. A few areas feel lackluster (Minas Tirith being one room, for instance, and lacking any siege of Gondor level), but overall the world is well constructed and relaxing to gallop about.I'll say this though, the collectables are obnoxious and perhaps the numerical peak in the Lego series. Playing through the game you'll come across quite a few blocked off areas and currently indestructible bricks. At first this makes you eager to go back and satisfy that completionist urge, but the sheer number of them quickly becomes overwhelming. Unlike Lego Star Wars (where a thorough first try would net you the majority of a level's secrets), you'll probably have to play the same levels half a dozen times before being able to sit at a comfy 100%.But don't let that dissuade you from an otherwise enjoyable game! It's unadulterated Lego fun and a quality escape for a few lazy afternoons."

Harry Potter part I and II, lego star wars (complete edition) and clone wars, lego batman I and II (have the III), lego movie and lego superheroes (or something like that). So I'm not a newbie to Lego games. And yeah, I still love them to bits.Lego Lord of the Rings brings us the open world that I had seen previously in lego movie, lego harry potter and lego superheroes. Lego Star Wars has a somewhat open world, but not like this.Lego Lord of the Rings has one thing I did not like though. I like to be able to do missions and play with the charactes I've already unlocked in the free world. So I won't get tired of only doing story based missions. In Lego Lord of the Rings you can only play in the open world with the characters you have. For example, when I finish a mission with Legolas and Frodo I can only play with them until I do the next mission. Even if previously I was playing with Legolas, Frodo and Sam, if Sam for some reason disappears as that mission ends, I can't play with him. That annoyed me a little bit.It took me 9 hours to finish the missions (I did spend some time trying to get some bricks). Lego Lord of the Rings has the usual 10 minikits, has a ""blueprint"" that you must get in each mission and has 3 ""items"" you must also get in each mission.In the open world you can get bricks by completing races, getting to tricky places with some characters and do some quests for characters that you'll give you bricks or red bricks. The ""quests"" also exist in Lego Superheroes and somewhat in Lego Movie.Overall I liked this game like I do with every lego games. I wasn't too familiar with the story (I've seen one movie and am currently reading the books) and I liked it. I didn't think it had as much humour as the previous Lego games I've played but I did like it.And yeah, of course I'll buy another lego game when it is 4.99 again."

Now i'll be the first to say that i normally do not play movie tie in games. But with it being a Lego game that doesn't  really matter.

Not once did i ever get bored with the building.Classic Lego humor we all know and love.THE BAD:Control wise all u use is the keyboard and that's it. Now me i have no trouble using that.

At its worst, it is repetitive and slow, with tons of puzzles that you have to do to cover fifteen seconds of the movies.

They follow a pattern but its so intertwined in the story you don't even notice. Having all of the original audio from the film, including dialogue, was a HUGE plus for the gaming experiance. Especially with all the added jokes and gags, which none were rediculously cheezy, they were perfectly executed.

Prety much all the things that were design choices that impede your ability to play are fixed in The Hobbit lego game. Unfortunately I played that first so while if it had been the other way around I might have been ooohing over the delights of The Hobbit as it was LoTR felt like I was playing a badly broken beta of it.The control scheme has it's awful moments, suddenly forcing you into unhelpful fixed camera perspectives, making it excedingly difficult to tell exactly how you are positioned relative to other stuff, the targetting screws up regularly meaning you may fall through objects you are trying to grab or simply swing wildy at things you are trying to hit. The counters on missions glitch making it hard to tell whether you have collected everything. The levels themselves sometimes just plain break as trigger points fail to trigger and your progress is entirely stopped. NPCs mis-position themselves and become unable to interact with. A lot of the achievements are buggy and if you aim for completion (I do on Lego games at least) you are looking at a reasonable amount of frustration as you may have to repeat the requirements for various achievements multiple times before you get them to trigger - and at time of writing I am still missing one, very easy to get achievement as it refuses to pop no matter how many times I complete it. Most progress stopping problems with the game can be fixed by killing it completely and restarting it. This will unfortunately not save you from the rest of the bad design choices though.Feel like walking miles? LoTR = yes, Hobbit = summon a mountStupid camera angles screwing up your positioning? LoTR = yes, Hobbit = helpful marker underneath youCan't hit/grab items? LoTR = yes, Hobbit = all works like a charmCharacter wants to hit random crap? LoTR = yes and there's nothing  you can do about it, Hobbit = you can aim anything even remotely rangedWant to change to a character with the ability you need? LoTR = well screw you, we've decided to turn the character following you into that one. And since you were half way up a jump quest at the time when we did this, the jumping character will not only fail to get the ability it needed, it will also immediately ambled off the edge of the jump quest to rejoin its now useless partner on the ground. I mean really this one♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off so many times. There seems to be some inherant desire to keep characters the same size so if you have Legolas and say, Frodo (one big, one small) and half way up a jumpy thing you need  a rope so you figure you'll switch from Legolas to Sam, it will switch Frodo to Sam and switch your focus to him leaving Legolas to leap off the jump quest, and this is despite explicitly selecting the character from the menu of all possible characters etc etc. Amazingly in the Hobbit when you selected to switch to a different character, it just switched to a different character...Honestly, I played through it out of stubborness, but really if I had known how incredibly annoying it was going to be I would never have bought it. If you are a seriously casual player, don't care about completion and don't mind having to restart the odd level every so often in order to progress it might be an okay game for you. Unless you are really invested in Lego/LoTR though there are better games out there, better lego games and better LoTR games..."

LEGO Lord of the Rings is a fantastically charming and funny walk through the famous trilogy. With plenty of characters to play and replay missions with, items to collect and bricks to smash apart or put together, there is hours of content for you to complete.Play alone or with a friend over network or on local co-op. Exploration is rewarded. As is destruction.Many cinematics and cut scenes however, are not skippable, which might give you long breaks in the gameplay that you would rather not watch. Local co-op gameplay, whilst not the horrible experience of split screen gaming, does divide the screen into two halves when enough distance is put between characters.Pros:Charming and funny gameplay and cinematicsHigh graphical fidelityResponsive controls and combat.Cons:Long, story heavy cinematics.Local co-op single screen looks uncomfortably strange on screenAwkward keyboard controls.

,Recommended,214510,8775062,"Posted: 19 January, 2014",all,Mountain Man,"SummaryIt's just another LEGO game, but that's not necessarily a bad thing.ReviewIf you've ever played a LEGO game before then you already know exactly what to expect from LEGO The Lord of the Rings.  There are no surprises here.  Having said that, this is a fun and well-made game that fans ofThe Lord of Ringsfilms will enjoy.  Of particular interest is the overworld which allows you to walk from one end of Tolkien's Middle Earth to the other with no loading screens.  Not at first, of course, since certain parts of the map will be locked off until you've completed the requisite story level, but once you've finished the story mode, you can walk from Hobbiton straight through to Mount Doom without stopping.  It's not to scale, so the trip will only take you a few minutes, but it's still very cool, and the sights along the way will be familiar to fans of both the books and the movies.The individual levels are very enjoyable and contain lots of puzzles and secrets, most of which can't be accessed your first time through since they require the right character, so you'll want to go back and play them again in Free Play mode which gives you access to every character on your roster; however, you may want to wait until you've beaten the game because then you'll have every character you need to tackle every challenge, and finishing the game isn't hard since it's virtually impossible to fail.  If your character dies, you lose some studs (LEGO currency that you use to buy special unlockables) and your character is immediately resurrected on the spot, so even the most ham-handed gamer should have no trouble being able to make it to the final cutscene.LEGO games are known for their humor, but I was somewhat surprised at just how funny these cutscenes are.  Since they use dialog from the movies themselves, the animators had to be creative, and there are endless visual gags like the possessed King Theoden briefly nodding off while talking and Grimma Wormtongue elbowing him in the ribs to get him talking again, or Lurtz taking down Boromir with bananas and chickens fired from his bow (trust me, you'll never look at Borormir's climatic scene the same way again).  Who knew that the films' relentless severity lent themselves to so much humor?The game looks good with its colorful, high resolution textures and lighting effects.  We're not talking Arkham City quality, of course, but it does the job, and the music is great because it's taken straight from the Howard Shore soundtrack, so no complaints there.  I did run into several minor glitches throughout the game, such as characters getting stuck in the level geometry or suddenly freezing in place while the game carried on around them forcing me to restart from a checkpoint, but this was relatively rare.  Finally, multiplayer works great with the innovative dynamic splitscreen, and my boys had fun playing through the game with me.  I might even go so far as to say that this is the recommended way to play.Buy this game if you're a fan of LEGO games andThe Lord of the Rings, but if you've had your fill of LEGO games then move along because there's nothing to see here."

It was a Lego Star Wars and feelings which I have to that game are so warm. Mostly because I am a huge Star Wars fan and the second reason - back in those days me and my friends gathered around the computer and played together. Yeah that was with the help of hot-seat mod. We had a lot of fun. One day my computer crashed and I had to repair it and reinstall everything. While i was doing that i forgot about Lego game.But time moves on so do I. I grew up and eventually thought that Lego games are for kids. However, once i got sick so I had to stay home for a while and I wasnt able to visit my University. By coincidence Lego LOTR was on sale only 3.14$ + I was a bit bored at home. Finally, main reason is that i am also a huge LOTR fan. I love universe whichJohn Ronald Reuel Tolkien created. I've read his books. (LOTR of course, Hobbit, some parts of Silmallirion). Peter Jackson movies are also pretty good they have soul. The question isDoes this game have a soul?StoryStory goes according to Jackson films. And it's being served in a funny way. Plot isn't a dump mass of stupid jokes, it has a story and behind this story jokes and gags are comming. Because of that each character's goals and reasons are explained to player. That makes player who is never touched LOTR universe to feel comfortable. Another plus is absence of jokes ""below the belt"" which are very popular in modern society.Map/WorldThis is a new feature to me. I was very happy to see this one. So now you have a world of Middle-earth (I mean locations where film scenes took part). Developers made a good job, areas are situated according to books and roads are matched with a story. So the LOTR fans couldn't argue much. But it's pretty exciting to walk your own way from Shire to Mordor. Also add to that ability to visit Helms Deep, Isengard, Weathertop(especially at night it's beautiful) and much more. This world isnt't dead you can find camps, citizens, orcs, dwarfs ( some of them have a quest for you). Another good trifle - sometimes if you are attentive enough you could find some references to Bilbo journey and to the LOTR universe itself.CharactersYou have bunch o these. Every person from films is present here even those who where cutMouth of Sauronand those who weren't in filmsTom Bombard. Each character has it's own special abilities. For example, Sam can set fire on, Orcs are strong and can pull specific lego objects, Golum climbs on the walls etc. Voicelines are good almost the same as original. So you will definitely have a lot fun with this number of characters. And yes you can build your own one.GameplayIt's hasn't changed much from the old Lego games (unless it's a Lego Legoland or racers he-he). But now we have more puzzles to solve and they are more interesting not just simply build that or put this by the Force. Now we have to feed hobbits or throw fish at Golum plus almost every character has different ability that makes game interesting enough. Also new features like stealth(yeah hiding from the Black rider), horse riding, Crash Bandicoot mode, Troll riding. Boss fights at first seems to be interesting but in the end of the game they are the same: this is boss ====> you cant hit him ====> stay on the platform and wait till boss attacks you ===> boss weapon is stuck in the ground/wall/water/dwarf/corn flakes ====>time to hit the bad guy ====> Boss destroys platform, rebuild the platform and repeat 3 times. Note: fight with Barlog is so long, boring and annoying. However after all gameplay was interesting and I wasnt bored too much.CollectablesAnother new feature to me. On each level you can find amount of items wich are needed for quests. Some of them give you special abilities and some are just ridiculous like mushroom crown. Also after completing level you will get mithril blocks with the help of which you can forge items. Items could be different like fire or ice bow, tripple shot bow, fast boots, disco ball( madness) etc.MusicOst deserves a big plus. Compositions are chosen perfectly. Howard Shore made music for the film and his compositions are present in this game. It's incredible hearing Shire theme in Shire or theme of Rohan in the Rohan lands. This is a great plus. Ost makes you smile.ConclusionDespite some repetetive moments and sometimes crazy camera this game is good. It is made with love to LOTR universe which makes me happy and not disappointed in developers. Hot-seat mode makes everything twice funnier though.Lego Lord of the Rings is worth buyingP.S. If you ask me about raiting I would give this game 8/10."

One thing that bugged me was how many of the sounds have been cut directly from the movies. This was particularly prominent in the helms deep cutscene where you could hear the rain when characters were speaking (from the scene in the movie where it was raining) but in game there was no rain (or if there was it had no sound).Other than a few bugs and gliches that can be found (some amusing but many irritating) this is a great game. Its hard to describe it if you havent played a lego game before but if you has almost everything you didnt like (or at least thought could be better) in the older games have been improved in this one.

Also, the open world is amazing.It's a LEGO game, there's not much say about it. There's tons of collectibles, several characters, charming missions and plot. There's even dialog in this one. What does set LEGO LoTR apart though, are the side quests, because it is open world, there are a plethora of side quests, similar to an RPG. You can just gather side quests and burn some time doing those, or skip them and dive right into the plot. The side quests are fun though, I suggest doing them.This game is awesome.9.4/10"

Getting your character to du what you want can be an exercise in frustration. Your character moves to the left of the screen when you hit left and so on, but when the screen direction is constantly shifting because the game feels free to swing around to a different camera angle which you didn't want controlling where you're giong becomes an exercise in frustration. This is particularly aggravating in jumping and climbing sequences where sudden camera shifts can cause you to miss a jump and you get to do the entire sequence all over again.There are better games, avoid this one."

The dialogue is spoken, so no-Lego babble, can be a pro or con depending on your likes. Tons of extra content to un-lock!First, I'm a LOTR and Lego fan, so I am biased.  Even so, I would recommend this game to anyone who likes games with a good sense of humor.Some of the earlier Lego games may have turned off ""serious"" gamers, but imo they are definately getting better. I haven't played them all, but this one was a very positive surprise.First, they put all the main LOTR movies in one game, so there is very little padding (un-like say in the Star Wars Lego games).  The main story goes through most of the major plots points in well designed, fun and most importanly non-frustrating levels/missions. Once you leave the Shire the world opens up, offering plenty of exploring. Its not a GTA game of course, but the world is intuitive and fun.Once you finish the main stories, you can unlock free-play. I found this easily added a good chunk of play hours.  There are entire mini-levels that you would miss completely if you had not unlocked the required mini-figs to access them!Final word, get a decent gamepad, leave your cynicism at the door and have fun."

,Recommended,214510,19756767,"Posted: 17 December, 2015",all,Dirk Dickbutt,"Lego Lord of the Rings is pretty cool I guess.After the success of J.R.R. Tolkien's beloved novel: The Hobbit, he began to work on an epic saga about an all powerful ring that would bring the destruction of a place called Middle Earth. He wrote this series between 1937 and 1949 but not having it published until 1954 and 1955. What Tolkien gave us became one of the most renowned and beloved series of books in Fantasy history, pioneering many tropes, themes, and subjects that would cement themselves in literature, video games, movies, and many other art forms. So what better way to celebrate Tolkien's legacy than by remaking the movie versions of his coveted series but in miniature brick form?PFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF-Lego Lord of the Rings takes place during the Third Age of Middle Earth, two and a half millennial after Sauron, the Second Dark Lord and most trusted lieutenant of Morgoth, the first Dark Lord, is defeated in the land of Mordor, at the slopes of Mount Doom, by an alliance of Men and Elves during the war of the last alliance after he loses possession of the one ring, a powerful artifact forged in the fires of Mt. Doom to concentrate his own power as well as exercise his own dominion over the other rings of power, magical rings that were forged by Calebrimbor, Prince of Noldorin and the last of House Feanor.Wow, look at all those made up words.This one ring is picked up by Bilbo Baggins, a Hobbit and dirty little sneak thief who steals the precious from Gollum, who was also a hobbit at one point but now looks like my sister, a moldy grilled cheese sandwich. But Sauron, being the big♥♥♥♥♥♥OG that he is, is regaining his power and mustering his forces to regain the one ring.Frodo Baggins, another filthy little hobbit, is forced to take this mighty ring to the fires of Mt. Doom, the only place that can destroy it outside of the oven at Papa Johns, ooo that's spicy! So Frodo, Sam, Marry, and the other Marry, team up with Aragorn: Son of Arathorn, Legolas: Prince of Mirkwood, Gimli: Son of Gloin, Gandalf the Grey, and Sean Bean on one of the most epic fetch quests to ever exist.Oh right, this is a lego game,♥♥♥♥♥♥ hold on.I forgot to mention that pretty much everything in this game is made out of Lego, save for a few exceptions. Have you ever played a Lego game before? It's like that. So everyone is made of Lego, they move like Lego would, and they fall apart when they die like Lego. So what you have is a Lego platforming game about the first three LOTR movies instead of the books. Which is cool because all of the dialogue that is actually spoken outside of a few random NPC's is straight up from the movies.There are two parts of the game, the parts where you play through a level that was inspired by the movies, and the part where you move from place to place over a pretty good looking over world of Middle Earth. I have to say the game is pretty impressive for what it is. There are parts with a ludicrous amounts of little Lego orcs in them and it's almost baffling how I didn't have slowdown with so many jokers on screen at once.You can't die in LLOTR, I mean, you can, but there's no game over screen. It's obvious that these games are meant for kids, but this game is neat even for a kids game, like the one Chuck-E-Cheese that still has a Marvel Vs Capcom Machine. It's there, but you have to bring your little brother so you don't look like a total weirdo.  I don't have a little brother so I'll bring your little brother instead. I'm getting that machine one way or another.But should you play Lego Lord of the Rings: The Return of the land lord?Get it for cheap, it's fun and a well made game, but there really isn't enough meat on the bones to warrant a full price, I'm also pretty sure I hear Tolkien going mach speed with the rolling in his grave right about now.Lord of the Smorg gets 3 men who's last names are just their father's first names out of 5.The one Curator to rule them all:http://steamcommunity.com/groups/Dickbuttexperience#curation"

I suggest in stead of grinding it out, to play it once in a while and finish it slowly.Overall, this is a great game to destress and enjoy the Lord of the Rings triology.

And you go on the internet and everybody keeps praising them. ""If it aint broken, don't fix it."". Well lego star wars came out in 2005. Every lego game has been the same since then. Personally I miss the old lego games like ""lego Island"" ""Lego Racers 2"" and one of my favorite games of the past ""rock raiders"". But getting to this game, Yes a lot of it shares the same pattern of the lego games after star wars, but they shake things up enough that this one is acutally good and worth buying (on sale). The graphics have been pumped up and look good, It is open world (at least inbetween levels), and it was really well done in connection to the movies. They use the sound clips and conversations from the movie directly, instead of just ""grrr, blah blah, grr"" from the other lego games. But I would say if you are not a fan of lord of the rings (specifically the movies) then dont buy it. So much of the humor and value of the game is playing it and watching the cut scenes and noticing the differences that they made to make it humorous. Oh well feels weird talking this long about a lego game from a critical standpoint. But yes, even though it follows some of the basic layout that I'm getting sick and tired of in lego games, It has so much more to it that it is good enough to play though and not go insane with boredom.

,Recommended,214510,2626429,"Posted: 29 November, 2012",all,Vitamin ω «Expired Tomato»,"LEGO The Lord of the Rings is the classic tale we all know and love set to prop comedy and Louis Armstrong's seminal hit ""Blue Yodel No. 9 (Standing on the Corner)"". All the major beats of the classic teleplay are present: young Frondo Baggins is left to care for his uncle's estate after uncle Bilbo announces his retirement from the LAPD. However, the wise wizard Gonald realizes that a piece of confiscated bling Bilbo passed on to Frondo is in fact The Ring, and sets him off on a quest with his gardener Rudy.However, Frondo is situatied somewhere in the back of the title card for the game, and the story does not truly begin until reaching the elven city of San d'Oria, where Viggo Mortensen and a young Jimmy Connelly (stunningly rendered in LEGO form thanks to advancing mocap technology) join the group. Many trials and tribulations await our heroes, not the least of which trials and tribulations await our heroes, not the least of which the mad Gallum.If you've played one LEGO game, you know what to expect. LEGO The The Lord of the Rings ups the ante by introducing a basic questing and crafting system, as well as an inventory management system that puts the likes of the Resident Evil series to shame. Many medieval stand-ins appear for similar elements in other Legos games: minikit pieces become treasure chests, gold bricks become mithril (used for crafting and the exclusive one million dollar cash prize Traveler's Tales is running), and red bricks become red bricks.The LEGO Lord of the Rings takes the idea of an open world, first attempted in LEGO The Batman 2, and tweaks it in an interesting way. The hub world is in fact a completely explorable LEGO The Middle Earth, complete with side objectives. While the normal level-by-level gameplay occurs in the same static camera layout we've all come to enjoy, these little breaks between levels are a nice median between the tiny hubs of elder lego games and the huge, yet dull, world of LEGO Batman 2.Traveler's Tales has opted to pull dialogue straight from the movies for this game, which makes sense because they ultimately do not have the budget to bring on amazing, well-paid and respected actors like John Rhys-Davies and that guy who looks like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Paulie Shore. Not only does this make the dialgoue volume slightly inconsistent, but it also creates interesting scenarios, like that part where Boromir dies like a ♥♥♥♥♥ being voiced with all the seriousness it deserves, while portraying a LEGO man dying of a banana to the chest.The game supports local co-operative play, which is also a staple feature of The LEGO games. The games are fairly simple to pick up and play, and provided you don't play with some♥♥♥♥♥♥who keeps wanting to kill you it's sure to be a good time. The game also splits the screen if the two players stray too far from each other, which demonstrates the amazing power of the Cell. Just don't play with your ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ younger cousin, because at some points in the game the two players control two different aspects of the same scene, and he's not going to get anywhere if you aren't there holding his hand.In conclusion, LEGO the Lord of The Rings does not disappoint, but that's only because it's impossible to set the bar for these types of games too high to behin with, and any attempt the game makes to surpass the bar is worthy of praise. Buy this game for something fun to do with friends over the weekend. Just don't invite the sperglord who loves Lord of the Rings, because I swear to God Kyle nobody gives a♥♥♥♥♥♥if this isn't a 1:1 reproduction of the movie we're just trying to have a ♥♥♥♥ing good time."

LEGO Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy in 2006.Being a huge Star Wars fan and a LEGO fan I had to check it out. I really enjoyed the Star Wars nostalga and all the LEGO humour. Being a Lord of the Rings fan as well I decided to grab this game during the most recent sale. I have been playing it with my girlfriend, and we just finished the story of the first movie in the series. It is an excellent game for two people to sit down and couch co-op.A caution to those who do not have controllers to use with the PC. This game is extremely hard to play on the keyboard, especially with two people! You will want to have two compatable controllers because where this games shines is in it's two-player co-op. Tonnes of LEGO LOTR characters to choose from as you often travel with a party of five or more through middleearth.I Love this game, the humour is great, the storytelling is spot on, and the collecting just never stops. If you want to play as any of your favourite  LOTR Hero's or Villains this game is for you. The Learning curve is quite simple and gameplay runs smoothly.The split screen on Co-op took a little while to get used to but once you do the game is great. Don't expect too much of a gameplay challenge as it is pretty easy, you don't lose lives just LEGO studs (money to purchase characters and items ""in game"").Where this games' challenge lies is in its treasure/loot hunting. The Levels are littered with puzzles and secrets that you require multiple different LOTR characters abilities to unlock. This makes replaying levels with new characters you unlock essential for having a complete experience.Don't shy away from this game if you have more than one person and require some two player console style fun, Get out of your Hobbit hole and whip around with some little LEGO Hobbits in a somewhat freeroaming LEGO Middleearth."
76561198036248633,Recommended,214510,14291692,"Posted: 1 February, 2015",all,IrethTasartir,"First, I wanna clarify that I overall like this game much. All negative critics I point out is mearly there to say what would i like changed in LEGO games, since  they had become what they are. I don't regret a single dime spent for this game. It's really really good game overall. I will just point out common things shared between theese games that were requested bilion times already, and that should not be as it is now.Playing other LEGO games (and I did play most of them), first thing I was against is yet still no Mouse support..but to be honest in this game you don't miss that nearly as much as in LEGO Batman 2 or 3. So Would give this game a go on no mouse.Story in game has become really good now, compared to old games when there were no talking what so ever. I really enjoy watching cutscenes no matter how long they are, so I kinda mind when cutscene is rushed a bit, and most of all I mind not being able to see cutscenes over again. I mean common..How hard it is to import unlockables video libary. Most of games have that now.. Imagine how cool would be to see cutscenes only when you finish entire game, or if you miss bit of cutscene (if something distract you).Having to little control keys and not be able to change all of them. I know this was aimed mainly for younger public, but older can find this game pretty apealing. So why not think about people who look at all points. Besides, younger players are really advanced now, so nothing strange when 7 yo looking at options to change everything around. I've seen that too. I gues in this game, if you are about to look at map this much, give us tiny minimap (with option to turn on/off), or at least make bindable button assigned. If i wanna go to map I have to pause and go down twice to choose map.. Sigh..anoying. Especially when you figure that they have boathered to bind FX for certain options screens and no MAP BIND? at least i didn't found it...and what's with random key placing? backspace = zoom out; F1 zoom in? Ha? how did they connect those two? and why not same buttons i use anyway. I'm not gonna JUMP while looking at map?I really feel that controls are bit outdated. They need revision. Taging players can be so exhasuting sometimes. Especailly when in critical times characters decide to tag other character that is far away or no where near logical choice. Improve that AI, ha? There is pretty frustrating issues with AI playing in Singleplayer. Example where you climb up really high (pain in the♥♥♥♥♥♥ if you ask me, with being able to easily miss point and fall all the way down), than if you have to switch character...it decides to actually tag instead of switch, and while doing so, AI controled char would just jump back down, therefore making all your trouble for nothing.Next. This game has gone towards a RPG a bit, and I like that, but if so, make it than bit more in order. Character inventory and equip example...SIGH how many times I had to reequip certain weapon after unlock it. I like using cluster bow, but OH THAT frustration when you equip it and you hit shoot, your character decides to switch back to melle weapon just to hit your tag companion that's lurking around (sucky autotargeting i guess), making your special bow unequiped. :( It looks like developers just threw some new stuff in game, withouht effort to test it out, or more, fix the problems.Seems like we've been playing same product over and over again, without too much technical improvements, and that should change, since it's bit outdated now. Few simple fixes would do the trick.Other than those small things that can sometimes be really big, this game is still amazing. Awesome graphics. Good gameplay, fun experience over again. You would think that after several same games you would get bored of this, but seriously...NO. Amazngly how it's doesn't get old. Just pick your favorite theme and go for it.Happy gaming everyone."

It received so many good reviews I thought it would be at least mostly fun.Alas, it is mostly boring as hell.I admit, technically it is expertly done. It looks good, play smoothly and is overall very polished. But the gameplay mostly consists of two extremely boring features:1) Running around the area, looking for hidden LEGOs. Could be fun if it wasn't so overwhelmingly omnipresent. Looking behind every bush is somewhat fun when it's mixed with other activities, like for example killing stuff, but on its own it is about as fun as vacuuming a very complicated room with plenty of complicated furniture. Without using hands.2) Rewatching long scenes from the movie, rendered in the LEGO world. What was the point of this? If they did an actual parody (with actual jokes), or I don't know, didsomething different, okay, but this? I've seen the movies, thank you very much, it looked better in the cinema, now give me stuff to do or at least let me skip the scene!There are a lot of good elements too, I really liked the combat mechanics and some ever-changing level design (like the Black Rider motif).

So, I really want to love this game. I really, really want to love it. However, I just can't. I purchased this game on December 27, 2012, almost exactly three years ago. Despite meeting the sytem requirements, I was one of the people to be caught by a bug in the game that prevented me from making it past the prologe. It really sucked. The next year, with a new pc, I was able to complete the Black Rider, but I could go no further. Fast forward to the summer of 2015. I finally purchased a decked out gaming rig and was ready to give the game a go. It was pretty great. It had all the cheesy lego action that I expected, the wonderful sound track, and an open world approach. In short, it was everything I wanted all those years ago. However, It is hard to feel great about a game that was purchased for full price and wasn't playable for years.The short and simple is this: Go ahead and buy the game if you well exceed the system requirements. Have a blast, it will be enjoyable. If you meet the system requirements or barely exceed it, then don't even bother.

All of the characters from the movies are here so far and represented well with a lot of dialogue actually taken directly from the movies. If you are a big Lotr fan or Lego fan or just have time to spare there is a lot of stuff to do in the game. Busting up things in levels to get lego studs is always satisfying although I was disapointed when I punched my dad in the head and no Lego studs came out.Fantastic game, 8/10"
,Recommended,214510,14088498,"Posted: 20 January, 2015",all,Joaten,"I am happy to join with you today in what will go down in history as the greatest demonstration for freedom in the history of our nation.Five score years ago, a great American, in whose symbolic shadow we stand today, signed the Emancipation Proclamation. This momentous decree came as a great beacon light of hope to millions of Negro slaves who had been seared in the flames of withering injustice. It came as a joyous daybreak to end the long night of captivity.But one hundred years later, the Negro still is not free. One hundred years later, the life of the Negro is still sadly crippled by the manacles of segregation and the chains of discrimination. One hundred years later, the Negro lives on a lonely island of poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of material prosperity. One hundred years later, the Negro is still languished in the corners of American society and finds himself in exile in his own land. So we have come here today to dramatize an shameful condition.In a sense we've come to our nation's Capital to cash a check. When the architects of our republic wrote the magnificent words of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence, they were signing a promissory note to which every American was to fall heir.This note was a promise that all men, yes, black men as well as white men, would be guaranteed the unalienable rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.It is obvious today that America has defaulted on this promissory note insofar as her citizens of color are concerned. Instead of honoring this sacred obligation, America has given the Negro people a bad check; a check which has come back marked ""insufficient funds.""But we refuse to believe that the bank of justice is bankrupt. We refuse to believe that there are insufficient funds in the great vaults of opportunity of this nation. So we have come to cash this check- a check that will give us upon demand the riches of freedom and the security of justice.We have also come to this hallowed spot to remind America of the fierce urgency of now. This is no time to engage in the luxury of cooling off or to take the tranquilizing drug of gradualism.Now is the time to make real the promises of democracy. Now is the time to rise from the dark and desolate valley of segregation to the sunlit path of racial justice. Now is the time to lift our nation from the quicksands of racial injustice to the solid rock of brotherhood. Now is the time to make justice a reality for all of God's children.It would be fatal for the nation to overlook the urgency of the moment. This sweltering summer of the Negro's legitimate discontent will not pass until there is an invigorating autumn of freedom and equality. Nineteen sixty-three is not an end, but a beginning. Those who hope that the Negro needed to blow off steam and will now be content will have a rude awakening if the nation returns to business as usual. There will be neither rest nor tranquility in America until the Negro is granted his citizenship rights. The whirlwinds of revolt will continue to shake the foundations of our nation until the bright day of justice emerges.But there is something that I must say to my people who stand on the warm threshold which leads into the palace of justice. In the process of gaining our rightful place we must not be guilty of wrongful deeds. Let us not seek to satisfy our thirst for freedom by drinking from the cup of bitterness and hatred. We must forever conduct our struggle on the high plane of dignity and discipline. We must not allow our creative protest to degenerate into physical violence. Again and again we must rise to the majestic heights of meeting physical force with soul force.The marvelous new militancy which has engulfed the Negro community must not lead us to a distrust of all white people, for many of our white brothers, as evidenced by their presence here today, have come to realize that their destiny is tied up with our destiny. And they have come to realize that their freedom is inextricably bound to our freedom. We cannot walk alone.And as we walk, we must make the pledge that we shall march ahead. We cannot turn back. There are those who are asking the devotees of civil rights, ""When will you be satisfied?""We can never be satisfied as long as the Negro is the victim of the unspeakable horrors of police brutality.We can never be satisfied as long as our bodies, heavy with the fatigue of travel, cannot gain lodging in the motels of the highways and the hotels of the cities.We cannot be satisfied as long as the Negro's basic mobility is from a smaller ghetto to a larger one.We can never be satisfied as long as our chlidren are stripped of their selfhood and robbed of their dignity by signs stating ""for whites only.""We cannot be satisfied as long as a Negro in Mississippi cannot vote and a Negro in New York believes he has nothing for which to vote.No, no, we are not satisfied, and we will not be satisfied until justice rolls down like waters and righteousness like a mighty stream.I am not unmindful that some of you have come here out of great trials and tribulations. Some of you have come fresh from narrow jail cells. Some of you have come from areas where your quest for freedom left you battered by the storms of persecution and staggered by the winds of police brutality. You have been the veterans of creative suffering. Continue to work with the faith that unearned suffering is redemptive.Go back to Mississippi, go back to Alabama, go back to South Carolina, go back to Georgia, go back to Louisiana, go back to the slums and ghettos of our northern cities, knowing that somehow this situation can and will be changed. Let us not wallow in the valley of despair.I say to you today, my friends, so even though we face the difficulties of today and tomorrow, I still have a dream. It is a dream deeply rooted in the American dream.I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed: ""We hold these truths to be self-evident; that all men are created equal.""I have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia the sons of former slaves and the sons of former slave owners will be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood.I have a dream that one day even the state of Mississippi, a state sweltering with the heat of injustice, sweltering with the heat of oppression, will be transformed into an oasis of freedom and justice.I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.I have a dream today.I have a dream that one day down in Alabama, with its vicious racists, with its governor having his lips dripping with the words of interposition and nullification, that one day right down in Alabama little black boys and black girls will be able to join hands with little white boys and white girls as sisters and brothers.I have a dream today.I have a dream that one day every valley shall be exhalted, every hill and mountain shall be made low, the rough places will be made plain, and the crooked places will be made straight, and the glory of the Lord shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see it together.This is our hope. This is the faith that I will go back to the South with. With this faith we will be able to hew out of the mountain of despair a stone of hope. With this faith we will be able to transform the jangling discords of our nation into a beautiful symphony of brotherhood.With this faith we will be able to work together, to pray together, to struggle together, to go to jail together, to stand up for freedom together, knowing that we will be free one day.This will be the day when all of God's children will be able to sing with new meaning, ""My country 'tis of thee, sweet land of liberty, of thee I sing.

I'll stick to a list of pros and cons.PROS:- Lord of the Rings theme.- Official soundtrack of the films.- A sense of humor, good for an occassional chuckle.- LAN multiplayer with up to 2 players, a rarity these days.CONS:- Fixed and unhelpful camera angles.- Quick Time Events as far as the eye can see.- Puzzles are extremely easy and generally only require you to press a button or two with the right character selected.- Poorly fitting dialogue and voices taken directly from the films and used regardless of tone of the scene in the game. Once Gimli even said one of Aragon's lines in Aragon's voice (""Mithril...!"").- Very confusing controls. Some menus require one set of keys while others require other keys. Only the movement keys are used for movement, the other 6 buttons seem to have been picked at random for every menu.- Singleplayer this game is very frustrating, as sometimes you must complete a number of mundanse tasks to continue. With two players this process can be sped up significantly. Fights with bosses (like a troll) are also much easier, since the troll will always be targetting a player.All in all a big disappointment."

I however am giving up on it after a little over two hours. The problem is that it's just not the game I was expecting, it has the tags action and adventure, but I'd make that a big adventure and a small action.This game frustrated me for the same reason that old school adventures do. I get stuck somewhere and although I eventually get past it, I feel like I just end up cycling through my available characters and run all over the place smashing everything and seeing if a trigger pops up. Also silly things like get stuck for ages knowing what I have to do but it seems like the last piece I need is nowhere to be found... only to find that I accidentally already picked it up with one of my characters and it was in their inventory. I don't think it's necessarily a fault in the game, it's just not my cup of tea.So, while it's a good game, I'm just leaving my negative review to warn other players like me. If you're the type to easily get frustrated because you get stuck and you don't care as much for exploration and collecting every small thing in an area as you would for some proper action, you might want to give this a miss.Oh yeah, one other thing... other reviewers say it's a must for die hard LotR fans? Make that die hard LotR MOVIE fans as the game follows the movie more than the book (even if they are reasonably close together for a movie adaptation)."

,Not Recommended,214510,33596950,Posted: 16 July,all,maelwys,"Having played through a number of the Lego games on various platforms, I found the Lord of the Rings LEGO game to be disappointing compared to others. The movie sequences are quite good - it has all the awesome signature moments from the movies that you want to see - but boss battles are repetitive affairs, the humor that is a hallmark of the games seems toned down and moments are few and far between, and the whole experience is marred by bugs and gameplay issues. More than once I had to restart a level simply because the game bugged and would not allow me to advance until I reloaded from a save. Add to this multiple pathing issues, jump puzzles that are pixel specific, and collectables that are nigh inaccessibile due to geometry and hit box bugs (ropes that characters fall through, balance areas that can't be jumped onto, etc), and it makes for a frustrating package that feels rushed and unfinished.TL;DR: If you want to experience the Lord of the Rings Trilogy, just go watch the films. It will take less time, and unless your DVD is scratched, you won't have to restart the scenes."

While I do understand that Lego LotR like its counterparts is a children's game, I think I might have gone a bit overboard by buying three of these during the last summer sale. Lego LotR left a particularly bad taste in my mouth compared to Lego Marvel Superheroes since it was full of so many graphical and audio bugs, it just didn't feel as clean of a product. Now, while alone I think the games are fine, I would recommend just sticking to the newest Lego game that comes out as they are all just carbon copies of one another with a different skin. Even if you are a big fan of LotR, the ""humor"" adding by a Lego game is quite minimal so I wouldn't really recommend that you get this game unless you have a kid who is really into LotR, this is a definite do not buy due to its age and lack of finishing on a audio and graphical level.You can find the full review here:http://mouseandcontroller.blogspot.com/2016/09/lego-lord-of-rings.html."

While I might not be the biggest LOTR fan there is, this game doesn't skimp on the story - it makes light of certain elements that kids might find a little distressing, but this isn't exactly a game designed for mature themes. It's lego, after all.The controls are adequate at best, and downright appauling at worst. You would need to bind your own keys from the default arrow keys and number pad (numbers 2 to 5, no idea who thought that was a good idea). I - for the most part - played it with a 360 controller, and bar a little ineptitude from my part, I had little issues with the controls. What makes it downright appauling then? If you have a 360 controller as player 1, and player 2 hops in on the keyboard, it isn't possible for player 2 to hop out, while player 1 can. Admittedly this has nothing to do with the controls, when you attempt to customise the keyboard controls after being forced to get rid of the controller and wanting to continue to play with something usable, player 1 now has no input. Pressing any button on the keyboard (including esc) will try to assign player 1's controller to that, but as player 2 is using it, it won't keep it. Trying to re-introduce the controller wont' help. I've pressed every button on both keyboard and controller, and onyl been able to get away from it by force quitting the game.As for character controls, the game is fine, except during the platforming elements. Or maybe I just happened to find one really, really bad one when looking for mythril blocks near Mt. Doom. It's bad enough to make half-life platforming look good.The graphics are okay, until you turn off depth-of-field and motion-blur, then they're actually quite pretty, and at least you can see stuff in the distance with it off.The comedy is as it is with all other lego games - slapstick and visual. It doesn't deviate from the story at all, so beyond silly disguises, or someone being hit over the head with something else, there aren't going to be too many giggles.To round this off - if you like lego, go play with lego. If you like lego games, you might like this one, but I'd suggest something else; this is easily the worst lego game I've played. If you like LOTR, then you might want to give this a miss. If you love LOTR or have kids who are into it, you might have some enjoyment from it."

And wow does this game try its hardest to make you fail. And the thing is, it's not a challenging thing, it's a bug thing.So imagine you're trying to cross a river thats about five feet across, and for whatever reason you tend to drown in water that is 2 feet deep. No matter, there are olf planks floating in the water for you to get across on - a good old fashioned jumping puzzle. But wait! Even though they are so close together you could probably just take a big step and get across, you cannot seem to jump to the next plank, as if there's an invisible wall around them. After the 17th try, you manage to get yourself from one plank to the next, realizing that theres only 3 more to go. Oh, and remember, if you mess up and fall, you go back to the river bank and start all over again.Or how about another jumping puzzle where you have to jump from a cliff to a clearly reachable rope to swing across a gap? Seems easy enough to handle. But wait! To add some challenge, let's take to camera to the worst - and I mean absoluteworstangle possible to it's impossible to gauge where you are relative to the rope. That'll leave ya guessing for a while, and everytime you miss and fall to the bottom, we'll let you plan you're next attempt while hiking all the way back up to try again.Or how about we have you climb to the very top of the tower at Isengard for a prize? Well, in classic LEGO fashion, we're going to give you several different obstacles to overcome using many different characters together. It's a great idea, but not when your character swap system is so broken. When you change to another person of the Fellowship, instead of swapping the character you're using, it swaps theothercompanion for the desired character, switches you to them, and before you can switch back to the player you nearly had to the top, you bet he's already jumped off to get back to you. It renders the character-swapping ""quick bar"" nearly useless, and cripples any kind of puzzles where you need more than one character.... not to mention, theres those damn planks again at the very top of that same tower to smack you down and crush your spirit.This game is beautiful in its world design, the levels are cool, and the humor is as you would expect with a LEGO game, but holy crap is this game buggy. On several occasions I'd have to restart the game because accidntally walking over a certain rock somehow launched me into orbit and wouldn't let me come back down.And every game is going to have a few little glitchy bits here and there, but these are so prevalent and obvious that I am very sure anyone at Tt that played this for more than twenty minutes noticed them. This leads to the suspicion that they saw the bugs and just didn't care enough to fix them before release - or any time in the four years it's been released.Despite all that, I had a very enjoyable time with this. Bu i cannot recommend such a broken game to anyone, and I am shocked to see that so many people have. Only buy if it's on sale for $5 or less."

This is an excellent retelling of a story we're all familiar with, laced with kid friendly humor. This is the staple of the series & TT Games delivers. However, this entry into the Lego series is problematic.Platforming is TERRIBLE. Most notibly are spots where you are forced to do the balance beam jumps. There seem to be force fields in the air that stop you from jumping far enough or into the right spot. you will repeatedly fall into the water on these sections & have to repeat the whole set of jumps over again.The stage ""Osgiliath"" is extremely buggy. The Ents will randomly rocket up into the air because of their shoddy clipping with the ground. There is a pit where if you get too close with an ent. He will go into a minute long trance & just walk toward it. The thunderous footsteps of the ents changes to clicks when the ent has both Pippin & Merry in possession. When the ent attempted to rip down the dam wall at the end of the map, the game seized all control & all I was permitted to do was change between the hobbits.On the stage ""Cirith Ungol"" there is a bug that will not allow you to trade items, between characters. If you happen to pick up 2 helmets or 2 armors with 1 character. You will be forced to restart the section.Basically this is an ok game, but it's not up to snuff. Glad I bought it on discount.

,Not Recommended,214510,9841402,"Posted: 17 April, 2014",all,Azundris,"I don't think I've ever taken such an instant seething hatred to a game as I did to some of the Lego ones currently on sale. Consistently getting 70+ % scores in reviews, utilizing popular franchises so you know in advance what to expect, and promising co-op, what could possibly go wrong?First off, Lego LotR does not recognize my mouse. And no, I'm not talking about game-play yet, I'm dropped into a game where you cannot even operate the menus with the mouse. My 360 controller doesn't seem to do anything, either. I google it. No, it's not a bug or configuration hiccup, the mouse is not supported. At all. This is a classic example of ""You could've researched this, but because the notion seems so insane, you never thought to.""On the upside, you can use the controller once you've told the game that that's what you want. Using the keyboard.At which point you may notice that there are two columns for control, player 1 and 2. A dark sense of foreboding descends upon you. You shop around the options, and sure enough, there is no online play. In all fairness, this has a degree of user error to it, as the steam description plainly says, ""local co-op"", but since e.g. Lego Star Wars had online play and most reviews you'll read don't specifically mention that this game doesn't, just ""co-op"", ""I played this with my kids,"" etc., there's certainly room for misunderstanding, so I'm warning you now.The opening cinematics have a forced-funny moment or two, but given the presumed audience, I'm not sure you can blame them for trying to make things more child-accessible, except that I had a couple of ""I'm not sure this would make much sense unless you've read the book/watched the movie anyway"" moments, so at that point you already need to have decided the undiluted version isn't ""too dark"" for your spawn. (Either way, you do essentially start off playing Isildur, who is then force-killed by plot requirements ten minutes later, so what are we even talking about here?)Perhaps unsurprisingly, the game immediately drops you into an uninteresting fight against minions and finally Sauron. The game doesn't exactly tell you what to do, but not having spent your life under a rock, you aim to cut off the dark lord's finger to get on with it. Which meant battling not so much Sauron, but the controls — I know this is probably aimed at children, but does it have to feel like that game where you're supposed to eat a candy bar with knife and fork wearing huge oven mitts? The directional controls were the most unprecise it's ever been my misfortune to suffer. Strangely, the dark lord seemed to have the same issue, because we spent 10 minutes bumping into each other and swinging our weapons around without inflicting any noticeable degree of damage on each other.That's all I can say about the directional controls, except that the camera ones aren't much better. In the opening scenes, an angle is forced on you, which you can change by a handful degrees either way. Later on, you fortunately get full rotation, but turning the camera still feels slow and laborious like pushing around a boulder.The challenge of the opening mainly consisted of picking the right character for a task (""it's not like you can't jump up there, it's that you can jump there as Isildur, it looks like Elrond does the same jump, but he'll succeed"", ""it's not like you can't destroy that, you just have to pick the character with the right sword"", etc). And yeah, you may have to read the character names to pick the right bearded and helmeted Lego head.At some point, I got sufficiently frustrated with the controls that I essentially switched to finding new ways of killing myself on Mt Doom (fell off the cliff, fell in the lava, etc.), which at first glance didn't seem to have any ill effects — outside of the minifig exploding into its parts, I mean. It's not so much that you ""lose a life"", it's that you lose gold, cos our guy Isildur is constantly looting stuff as he goes along. This gold is apparently later used to unlock new characters to play or something, which they allude to in an interstitial screen that came and went so fast I wasn't sure (I'd read that you can choose a character or even create one in the Hobbit house, so I was anxious to get there. Of course, that option was not offered, so I don't know whether you first have to complete some quests, or what.).So, yeah, you know why the minifig's hands look like that? Because they've given the lego computer games all their thumbs down.tl;dr Don't impulse-buy this, despite the sale. Research very, very carefully, much more so than with ""normal"" games, just reading a few reviews on metacritic can be vastly misleading. If unsure at all, Do. Not. Buy."

,Not Recommended,214510,9867351,"Posted: 18 April, 2014",all,ripentaro,"I have been a fan of the Lego games since the initial run of Star Wars titles. As such, I was well aware of the minor problems with controls and camera that have always been prepared to deal with them in each new Traveller's Tale title but the gameplay and glitch issues make this game feel incredibly slapdash. There are other issues beyond these that I take issue with but as they are secondary they shall wait till later in my review. Firstly glitches. You don't notice them early on but as you start to explore the HUB world more they become more redolent. You will fall through the world on an occasional basis but this can be fixed by instant travelling to a location. the more crippling factor is the broken collision detection for both characters and objects. Frequently you will find your character floating uselessly in the air. Floating objects are a more nefarious as they will render push and pull block puzzles unsolvable. These kind of glitches are so frequent as to render it impossible to believe that they would not have been caught by game testers had a proper  quality control been done. This leaves the game feeling, in spite of its graphical quality, extremely unpolished.Now on to gameplay. The controls are terrible. Direction feels imprecise and button response is indecisive. Buttons very often do not respond as desired, such as when holding the Y button is supposed to bring up the character select but instead just swaps you with the second player (extremely annoying when playing co-op). At other times they simply do not respond at all, such as the case of the extremely flaky jump button. This, paired with the vague directional input, leads to much cursing in what is essentially a platformer. Much of the challenge in this game arises not from clever puzzles but from the player fighting the controls.Another problem in gameplay are the design choices. Many quest-givers (is that a word?) are in hard to reach locations making just the act of turning in a quest an annoyance. More annoying are the menus. This is illustrated most by the constructable items. In the game you can build certain items that allow you to mimic one character's powers on another. This is rendered superfluous by the fact that you have to navigate 2 menus to equip the item each time so that it is simply faster to search one menu to find the character with the requisite power. Every time something requires doing you might as well just whip out Samwise The Swiss Army Knife of Middle Earth.Alright, the finale: Story. But this follows the story of the movies, right? That should be a good thing, right?... Actually, no. Here's why. There is no freedom to deviate from the scripts of the movies as they are married to using the film's audio. Part of the enjoyment of the Star Wars and Indiana Jones games where their ability to deviate from the source materials in order to better facilitate gameplay or to make jokes that could not be done with the source dialogue in place. Yes, there are added jokes in this game but as they cannot change or add dialogue many of them feel weird and out of place, especially in a movie that maintains a serious tone in almost all of its dialogue. The original audio also prevents them from adding story sequences that weren't in the movie, for example an added Tom Bombadil/ Old Willow Level would have made a welcome addition but, as there was no dialogue for this they couldn't. This issue of the audio was initially what steered me away from the game until the recent sale, mostly because of the serious tone of the story. I was not really interested in seeing these performances being juxtaposed with silly sight gags. My fear was realized and many of the jokes feel out of place or will leave you saying, ""Oh, that's just wrong."" Should have listened to my doubts. At least it was only five bucks."

Overall, it's a very sloppy port to PC.1) It's a PC game that doesn't support the mouse, despite several game mechanics being ideally built for it - for example aiming ranged attacks brings up a reticule that must be placed over a target. The game does not support the Playstation 3 pad, so if you want to play it, I'd have to recommend picking up a 360 controller.2) It's buggy. Characters will frequently get stuck in walls and other such similar annoyances. Thankfully if you move far enough away, they'll teleport behind you when you're not looking, but this isn't always an option. Mercifully, I've not found myself unable to continue at any point. Rendering errors are frequent - and I've found myself unable to continue past the Nazgul attack in the moors, as some sort of ground overlay is floating around in the z-axis meaning I can't actually see the gameplay area. From what I gather, the console version of the game have been patched, but the PC version has been neglected and abandoned. Reading online also indicates that there are bugs related to white blocks that can potentially make it impossible to finish the game.3) The overall design isn't great and the game has it's problems. Some of the character interplay towards the mid-game is nice and it may get better later (though I may potentially never find out as I'm unable to continue), but the level design is shockingly poor. The majority of the game is entirely linear, including the puzzle sections which have components that illogically have to be completed in a certain order rendering the puzzle section little more than a waste of time as you go through the required motions. Large parts of the game seem to take place on hills and slopes, but the player is tasked with collecting studs which are represented with rigid bodies - as a result you'll spend a lot of time chasing them down hills to collect them, only finding they have rolled into water or off a cliff and are therefore unobtainable. Some levels have too many playable characters - one level has the entire Fellowship of nine characters, which makes selecting the correct character a chore - it doesn't even fit on the character wheel any more. Some of the character icons, particularly those of the hobbits, are difficult to discern from one another, compounding the frustration. In some cases areas of the levels are enclosed and too small (such as structures in Rivendell), meaning that the camera is obscured by outside walls of the structure, meaning you cannot see what you are doing. Lastly, some of the lighting and choice of colour palette can make some things in the environment very difficult to discern, particularly during levels that take place at night.Overall the game is entertaining, but frustrating due to issues, and I cannot recommend it."

The only voice naration is literally the sound from the movies and the lego characters animated to look like they're talking. I think it would have been a lot cooler if they perhaps followed the storyline of the book, or even parts of the Hobbit.

Though most of the spoken dialogue is lifted straight from the films, it is still used in a creative fashion across the board. Howard Shore's amazing score punctuates every element of this game to make it as epic as its title implies.From a gameplay perspective, it pretty much plays like any other recent Lego game, but the addition of RPG elements such as weapon crafting and other equipment just make it slightly refreshing. With hundreds of items to craft, collect and test the game clocks in at well over 30 hours. It supports local split screen mulitplayer and is kid friendly. Get it now!"

It's well done and cute. Fun for all ages."

As it has been said by many others, the one aspect that wins over most people is the use of the actual dialogue and music from the LotR movies. With a very large number of characters to unlock from the world of Tolkien (beyond just LotR), a ton of tasks and quests to complete after you finish the story, there is always something else to do. Completionists will put many, many hours into this game."

I'll admit I'm slightly biased as I'm obessed with Middle-Earth, but it s a perfectly balanced game. The LEGO series is well known by now for creating polished, solid, and extremely fun adaptations of existing franchises, and LEGO The Lord of the Rings is no exception.This game would have been fun enough if it had just followed the lead of LEGO Star Wars and simply the player a selection of levels based on the movies along with a small hub. However, LEGO LOTR not only provides this, it also includes a full open-world version of Middle-Earth to explore between each level. This open world isn't empty either, it's full of side-quests, collectables, and characters to unlock.As with pretty much every LEGO game, the gameplay is very casual, and not meant to be very challenging. This may put some people off, but most people know by now how LEGO games work. The gameplay is fun, the twists on the movies' memorable moments are hilarious, and collecting thousands of studs is still so addictive. If you are fan of either LEGO games or The Lord of the Rings, if you are just looking for a bit of casual fun, I couldn't recommend this game enough.9/10Often on sale so might be worth waiting, but it is certainly worth its full price anyway. Fantastic game."

It follows the LoTR story relatively well (obviously it takes liberties) and the story mode took me about 10 hours on the first play-through.Essentially, you smash your way across the landscape, picking up lego 'studs' (money) solving puzzles and fighting lego monsters. The story is very linear, and it's not at all difficult. A couple of the puzzles were a bit touch and go... for example, I couldn't figure out how to kill Shelob the giant spider for quite a while... but it generally feeds everything to you on a plate, leaving you with what is essentially a hand-held but enjoyable little play through the LoTR universe... albeit in lego form.You can play all the way from start to finish unlocking areas as you go, without having to go back and repeat anything... but if you want to, you can unlock characters and go back to do parts of the game that you had trouble with earlier.If you're even remotely OCD then this one will really wind you up. There are so many little bits and pieces to complete (optional if you're not a completionist) but getting 100% of everything on every level is going to be quite a long haul.I've unlocked around 25% of the game after 12 hours... and that's just the easy stuff.The strength of this one is in the ability to go back after you've done the story mode and find all the extra little bits and pieces that you missed the first time. For example - there's a secret level where you get to play Sauron and smash up a miniature Middle Earth. I won't say where.There are dozens of characters to unlock. You can buy them with the 'studs' as you find them, and go back and collect the lot later on.There is no character progression to speak of, but there is a very simple crafting system, which allows you to exchange mithril bricks for items that you can discover and unlock on your travels.I wasn't expecting to enjoy this one as much as I did. I bought it for my little girl to play with, and thought I'd give it a try first. Suddenly, I realised I was hooked.Cons... the biggest one is the save system, which seems to be rubbish. A few times I had to repeat sections I thought I'd completed, because I hadn't found a statue which acted as a save-point.  Once you're in ""free-play"" mode after completing the story, however, you can save whenever you want.Other than that, and a few annoying camera angles, the game is extremely good. A light-weight explorer/platformer in the lego LoTR universe. Much fun."

,Recommended,214510,9200538,"Posted: 20 February, 2014",all,King James,"As a fan of the LEGO game series, I enjoyed LEGO LoTR. If you've never played a LEGO game, though, I'm not sure if this is the one to start with unless you're a big huge fan of LoTR. One of the things I've enjoyed about the LEGO games is the anarchic sense of humor and the willingness to lovingly goof around with the source material. However, LEGO LoTR is oddly restrained. Maybe it's because it not only follows the story of the film series, but uses actual audio clips in doing so, that the sense of playing around with the material isn't there like it is with the other LEGO games, such as the silent Star Wars and Indiana Jones games. Maybe it was an intentional design choice. The humor is still there, but it's just not there in the same laugh out loud way that previous games in the series had.Still, the game is fun to play. There's a wide range of characters, but the addition of the Mithril Treasures that allow any character to have the powers of any other character in some ways means that you won't be playing as quite so many characters in free play. Quite literally, once you've got the Mithril Treasures, you can play as a single character in Free Play and accomplish every task without switching out your character.Pretty much every character of note in the film series makes their way into the game, as well as some that only found their way into the Extended Edition footage. There's also some that never made it out of pre-production, like the love-him-or-hate-him Tom Bombadil. I am not a giant LoTR fanboy but I consider myself decently familiar with the source material both in film and book form, and even I'll admit that there were several characters I had to go to an LoTR wiki to remember who they were. The film's locations are also recreated on a small scale but are instantly recognizable. The details are appreciated especially as the game has an extensive overworld with a lot of secrets and quests to complete.If you're a veteran of the LEGO games looking to get your fix, or a big huge fan of LoTR (particularly the film series), I'd recommend this title. If you've never played a LEGO game, you may want to start with another title in the series to figure out whether they're your cup of tea before you pick this one up."

Sometimes one needs some relaxing, and in these moments a game should not be a job, but it should provide a sense of satisfaction and distract from the problems of every day life. In this, LEGO LotR is a full success. It  provides loads of nice images while you click on your keyboard to advance in the story, and the main purpose of playing becomes to see what comes next, what gorgeous recreation of the LotR world has been produced by the developers. There may be some small criticisms to be done: clicking can be a little too frantic at times, and the overall game is strictly linked to the fairly awful movie trilogy, but in spite of that it is simply so funny to see your small Lego characters do their jobs in the gorgeous environment. And there is, as in all LEGO games, a nice sense of humour which makes the playing experience quite enjoyable."

The only one i had previously played before this one was the Star Wars saga game which i really enjoyed so i was glad to see they had expanded on a winning formula and managed to keep fun as the main feature of this game.This game still has the wacky humour of previous games although has included the voces for characters instead of having mute characters. It still has all the stuff standard to all the Lego games like collecting studs in levels to use as currency, loads of characters with different abilities and collecting minikits as well as some new stuff.You have a nice open world middle earth to explore so you travel from level to level through middle earth. The open world has characters that give you quests to collect items found in the levels or craft them from mithril bricks which you can collect  in the open world or from completing levels. The items you craft also can be useful as well as being weird and funnyThe game is pretty easy to beat in story mode but the real fun is repeating those levels in free mode where you can use any character and item you've unlocked to play through the level which lets you collect items or explore areas you wouldn't be able to reach in story mode. It's a lot more difficult to try and collect everything in this game as there's just so much.The only complaint i have with this game is i found it to be quite buggy. There was a couple of occassions where i couldn't complete a level because of bugs (for example in one level all Frodo's items dissappeared from his inventory and i couldn't go any further because there was one i had to use). However while annoying it didn't happen often enough to be a major nuisance.So overall i'd recommend this game to everyone especially if you enjoy the Lord Of The Rings films or books. It may be aimed towards a younger audience but even as an adult i really enjoyed it. It's a great game to just pick up and play when you want to relax and just play a fun game. It's a 9/10 for me."

It railroads you through to the end, giving you little chance to explore, buy characters, get mithril blocks, and do Free Play properly.2. This game does have the occasional glitch, including two notable ones that forced me to restart the level.  There are statues that let you save in the middle of levels.  Don't overlook them.3.

Actually, I was disappointed I didn’t grab The Hobbit-LEGO while it was on sale too. (I bought it the second the title went on sale again, since LEGO titles seem to go on sale pretty often.)What first sold me was watching the re-created movie cut scenes with the twist of LEGO humor. There’s about an hour and a half worth of cut scenes, which are definitely not a waste of time. The “voice acting” is audio clips from the movies so it’s obviously spot on. And the music consists of the same majestic scores you hear in the movies, making simple tasks like lighting a fire 1000x more epic.If you’re going for 100% completion on the game, it’s going to take time: probably 30-40 hours. I’ve logged 37 hours and I’m at 82% completion, but I do mess around.You get to unlock pretty much every conceivable character mentioned in the movies (and some from the books, like Tom Bombadil) which allows you do things likeride a sheep around the Shire as Sauron.Now tell me that didn’t make a “Thank you for your purchase!” email arrive in your inbox. The entire world of Middle Earth is your sandbox.As a side note, I definitely suggest using a controller. The controls are pretty wonky and unnatural if you want to stay true to keyboard/mouse.Really the only drawbacks would be (1) that you don’t have much control over the camera angles, which makes some areas hard to navigate, but those instances are minimal. (2) The fact that since it is a game made for a controller, it’s a “one button does everything” control system so you’ll definitely end up dropping an object instead of using it a few times. And finally (3) if you’re an achievement hunter, there’s a couple buggy achievements, so I suggest you seek out a guide to overcome them.But all and all, it’s a great game if you want to kick back, enjoy Middle Earth, and hit things with a frying pan ‘till money bursts out. Oh, did I mention that there’s a “Mithril Disco Phial” that plays a remix song of famous LOTR quotes that your characters rock out to?Yeah, just buy it."

The lego gameplay fits the LotR world surprisingly well.The ""hub"" is the best I've seen so far in any lego game. There are also loads of hidden things from the lore as well as a bunch of easter eggs. The cut scenes are directly from the movies - as well as any voice acting. This means that the game is even more loyal to the movie than some other lego games (HP, PotC, SW). This also makes the levels super linear and full of cut scenes (which you cannot skip on your first playthrough btw). This means that a level consists of a number of sequences and you cannot backtrack to a previous one without starting that level from the beginning.Unfortunately the game does not really add anything more to the mechanics either. It still is mostly smashing things to get coins, changing to a certain character to get stuff done and unlocking things in the attempt to get 100% complete.Still, I found the game addicting and do not regret the time spent with it. A person not familiar with LotR might not feel the same.TL:DRIf you love Middle Earth and silly stuff: Buy itIf you dislike grinding, too easy gameplay and have no interesting in LotR: Maybe not"

The map is huge, very beautifully designed and you can roam around it whenever you want. There is so much to find and you can collect an astounding number of studs very quickly throughout Middle Earth. On the other hand, I have to say this has not been my favorite LEGO game. The levels can get tedious and a bit repetative in their nature. None of the characters can swim (you'll see why this is a problem later). Finally, there will be some bugs. The asthetics are certaintly more pleasing then the game but if you like open-world and especially ones that take place in your favorite trilogies, then I recommend LEGO LOTR."

But the good stuff comes along too, and more than makes up for the bad!I'll admit I'm a sucker for all things LEGO and I love the Lord of the Rings, so I might be a bit biased. If you don't give a crap about LEGO and you maybe don't care about the Tolkien universe... well you probably won't like this game. But if you're into it, then the constant slapstick will entertain, the puzzles will bring you joy, and if you play it with a friend it will be even better. The soundtrack is straight from the movie and it never gets old. The gameplay is easy and is just good silly fun. And those who like collecting everything will love this game... there are tons of collectibles, most which require solving puzzles that are more difficult than previous lego games and will employ all the character's skills. I think I finished the game with about 25% of all collectibles, so there is plenty of free play to be had after you finish the main story."

The game itself was just as fun as every other Lego game I've ever played.That being said...The bugs are too numerous. The number of times I've had to restart a level or a puzzle because a boss got himself stuck in the ground or an object flies off into space randomly or something along these lines was....well....a pretty big number. Far too big. Not to mention it also caused my computer to completely freeze up multiple times to the point where ctrl-alt-delete doesn't even work and a hard reset is required. I'm running a pretty decent rig that has no problems whatsoever with Far Cry 3 on 1080p in ultra settings, so I don't see it being my computer at fault here.I want to love this game.

Lego games are clearly made with Co-op in mind and this is no exception, so that means you need two controllers or a keyboard and a controller + a friend if you want the full experience, though you can still play alone alright.2. It is one of the buggier games out there. The bugs are not many but when they do show up they are somewhat game-breaking. For example, the Sauron fight at the very beginning is sometimes bugged to the point that you have to restart the game and you can't skip the long intro to that fight. The Xbox controller suddenly began to cut out every minute or so, killing your character unless you disconnect and reconnect it in time.3. The game is poorly ported from the consoles. You can quickly tell that you were not supposed to play this with the keyboard and there is no guarantee that it will support a non-xbox controller. Unless you already play games with a controller, you have to ask yourself if you are going to buy one just for this game?4. This is not a big problem, but you will quickly notice that the actors sound like someone with a cheap mic just recorded Lord of The Rings when it was on TV and put those recordings in the game.Some of the pro's are:- Co-op is well integrated into the gameplay for multiple players to feel useful.- Graphics and sound are...well they are Lego graphics and sound; they are fun if you are into that sort of thing- There are a lot of secrets, little puzzles and stuff to do. Pleasant level design overall.- Girls seem to like this game so you may get your partner to co-op"

Besides the main storyline that takes you from Hobbiton (well, actually from the War of the Last Alliance) to Mordor and Mount Doom, you get to run around Middle Earth in an open world setting.Beware the gold bricks on the Tower of Orthanc. They almost drove me crazy. You have to switch between Legolas and Gollum AND jump down with perfect positioning to reach one of them which hangs mid-air. Why couldn't we have any flying characters in LoTR - like those in Marvel / DC?Where the hell are those eagles again?!"

The graphics, even though they're lego, are absolutely gorgeous and it follows the entire story of the One Ring, so this is a great game to have on your library.There is also an insane number of collectables for the 100% people, though you'll probably go nuts trying to gather every secret."

But that's not a bad thing at all really. Though having played newer ones with a checkpoint access system that lets you go back to a certain area in free play to look for Collectables you're missing without playing the whole stage again it's absence in this game is annoying but understandable.That being said it's a solid game that's fun. You can't go wrong with any LEGO game but they love or die on their licences so it's a must for LOTR's fans who understand this game takes more liberties with the Movies than the Peter Jackson did with the books. For the sake of gameplay and fun. That being Said Randall was right in Clerks 2. There is only on true return and it isn't of the King, it is of the Jedi."

,Recommended,214510,33755489,Posted: 23 July,all,Montresor,"It's a LEGO game. It has a lot to due outside of the main story as you explore Middle Earth and complete quests to progress through the game. The story is fun and each mission uses unique mechanics to keep each one interesting. The level length is not bad either, they average 15~20 minutes. I have logged over 20 hours in the game doing the main story and free play. I have not collected every item in Middle Earth so there is a lot of content to play. The major downside is that my game is filled with random and annoying bugs. They are not game-breaking, however they can be extremely annoying. My character would get stuck and I would have to restart the mission, I was not able to turn in a quest, and the final encounter in the Mount Doom level would not register that I am tapping X (controller), therefore the fight would never end and it did this repeatedly. Like I said, not necessarily game-breaking, but very annoying. There were more little quirky bugs that I discovered while playing."

This is a very interesting title as it is not like your normal LEGO game where you have a hub in which you choose what levels to play, buy characters, check your progress etc. This one takes more of an open-world adventure approach with a huge explorable world. I would definitely reccomend this game if you enoy LEGO games as well as The Lord of the Rings!"

,Recommended,214510,35394969,Posted: 1 October,all,gg unit,"There is plenty good to say about LEGO games in general, what makes LOTR so noteworthy is that the Co-op play is amazing, the game is deep and allows both players to dynamically explore that depth.Instead of having a second player who plays a glorified AI bodyguard, stuck within sight of the 1P the two have seperate asymmetric roles in major battles, and both players can freely explore and complete goals in the world of Middle Earth.Tons of fun!"

For some reason it has an open world element without any kind of centralized hub.  The level design is okay at best, and boring at worst. There are two boss fights: shoot a thing with arrows until you are allowed to mash X and watch your character do something cool, and big invulnerable guy hits the ground and sends a damaging line to hit you, wait him out until he becomes vulnerable repeat. Most of the levels basically play themselves by giving you giant arrows to every objective you need, and giving a massive rotating gold border to things you need to throw rocks or shoot arrows at. Some of the platforming is decent, though there are quite a few places where you can get stuck, or something loses the ability to be interacted with, forcing you to restart the game. Button prompts, every single action you take you will get a button prompt, in boss fights you can usually press the wrong button and it will do the input anyway. All of the voice work is taken directly from the movies, and often isn't mixed very well, which gives the game a very cheap feeling. As I mentioned previously there are some severe scripting errors that can force a lot of backtracking if you're unlucky. A lot of the levels feel underdesigned probably because a lot of time had to go into the sparse world that you travel between levels. If you want a Lego game that feels both finished and has stellar level design, check out either of the first two Lego Star Wars games. 4/10"
