It's a terrific painted puzzle game with crazed creatures and gorgeous animations.There are5 worlds and each world contains 12 levels. The difficulty level is rising with each new world. In every new world you will get new items/creatures to solve the level.If you know the game'The Incredible Machine', then you know what you can expect from 'Eets Munchies'.The game is not hard to beat and it will not reach the difficulty level of 'The Incredible Machine'.I would have seen a sixth world, where you have to combine all the items/creature activated in the previous worlds.All achievements are easy to collect.Pros:+ gorgeous animations+ crazed items/creatures+ funny idea/concept+ level creator+ Steam Workshop to download levels made by Users+ option to speed up or slow down the animations/movements+ shortcut to start/stop the level (and sometimes other shortcuts)(+ Indie developer)Cons:- short gameplay time- not bloody difficult as 'The Incredible Machine'Recommended, but only if it'son sale, because of the short gameplay time.8/10"

,Recommended,214550,9443920,"Posted: 12 March, 2014",all,battybuddy,"Eets is a game about a little white... whatchamacallit thingy named Eets who is very hungry, and changes his walking behaviour via emotions: Happy, he'll just plod along at a leasurely pace and jump over edges, scared, he'll slowly creep and back away when he comes to an edge, and angry, he'll stomp around at a fast pace and pounce over edges like he's trying to win an olympic event- and you have to use these emotions and a bunch of activatable tools to get Eets to his goal of a nice tasty cake on a rope.  While I was a fan of the original Eets Chowdown (in fact, one of the first DLC I ever got on the Xbox 360) I do admit it had some flaws, most glaring of which was the precision of the puzzles combined with how very easy and tempting it was to just go ""Give me the solution"", and cheat your way to victory. While Eets Munchies has the same ""Give me the solution"" option, I'll be honest- I don't feel as tempted to actually USE it: So far the precision of the items is not as pixel perfect as the original, and those times where you do put something in the wrong place don't feel as frustrating.Another great improvement is the music. Sound effects are replaced with a bunch of notes reminesent of the old Warner Bro's Coyote and Roadrunner cartoons, where Eets foot steps are punctuated by music depending on his mood.  Given that Eets is now no longer 3D rendered, and is now 2D animation, this also makes it tons easier to tell what his mood IS exactly (a feature that previously had to be conveyed in a little close-up image of Eets- especially if Eets starts off the level in the air.)Add to that a level editor, and I'd say Eets is now a much better game then it's first outing."

This puzzle/thinking game is great for anyone who loves cute and silly things, while wanting a challenge at the same time! Did I mention that YOU can make your own puzzles in this game? Yeah, it's that awesome! This is why this game should win an award!"

I'm afraid I found it ""meh"" at best.  After a few levels I was already wondering how soon this would end...  The game is clearly made for smartphones as it's a rehash of the simple ""get 3 items and reach the exit"" idea.  In fact, it's probably better on smartphones than on PC, as there's no full screen grfx, and when you do enlarge the window the grfx do look too big.While just completing a level is pretty easy, however if you are someone who must get every 'pie' before the exit then this game will be quite difficult in the later worlds.  Especially so on the challenge levels (aka Mystery Levels) which have no hints and are very different from the previous ""worlds"".  I was finally able to complete one of the Mystery Levels after first attempting 5 or so of them.While the game is fairly polished, it just isn't very exciting or new.  It is, however, thankfully short -- I was able to complete all the levels in 2.5 hrs (except the Mystery Levels).6 out of 10."

It isn't always predictable, so you need to expect to do each puzzle multiple times, which I don't like. Most annoyingly, the click box for the items doesn't match the image, meaning you have to click just below each item to interact. It got super frustrating not being able to click items logically.4/10 ok but not worth $7"

This game is casual on some levels while merciless in others. The fact that it is clearly a mobile game for touchscreens is apparent from the UI as well as puzzles. I will not hold this fact against it though because it works well on PC, even going as far as integrating Steamworks. This grants the game a possibly endless array of user-created levels. Sadly one of the achievements is to create a level and publish it and so Steamworks is flooded with low-quality levels. This means the good ones are harder to find. I picked this up on a sale and you should too unless you are a big fan of these kind of games.------------------------------------------------------------------If you liked this review you can find more on theCurator pageor in myReview Corner."

Most of all it makes you made for thinking its somethiing easy to solve, then you get stuck on one level. Really nice puzzle game that makes you want icecream and cake at the end of the playing. If you have Klei titles you get 20% off, so get Don't Starve and lose yourself in adventures in crazy worlds so you can use this game as mind relaxing. In a sort of a way ... Enjoy ;)"

,Recommended,214550,13629870,"Posted: 26 December, 2014",all,Kane Reynolds,By far one of the best items I got during the Winter Sale this year. The soothing gameplay plus the puzzle solving in quite enjoyable. While not much in the way of difficulty I can safely say you won't be pulling your hair out with this one. It should be able to run good on most systems too. I'm only 11 mins in and I know I'll be enjoying this one for a while. The music is very much a long loop but by no means annoying. Get this one on sale -- you won't be dissapointed.
