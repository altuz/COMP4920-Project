To go along with this game of many bullets, bullet points!- 3 different ways of firing, each with an alternate function when charged, creating VASTLY more strategy and allowing for way more technique than your average ""just keep the fire button held down"" shmup- Beautiful, crisp and refined polygons; 3D graphics for a 2D shmup is pretty uncommon- Well-drawn character portraits and nice character design- Cool looking ships- Surprisingly good dialogue- Good music and atmosphere- Actually has a story worth your attention, but also allows for skipping and turning off outright- You can turn on hitboxes being visible for the enemies and your shots- Good progression- There are parts that are on-rails with a lock-on cursor and parts where the angles change- Boss rush mode and extras- As to be expected of a bullet hell shmup, it is challenging- 60 FPS, no load times and responsive menusThis is a shmup that actually tries to innovate and set the bar higher for its genre. This is probably my new favorite shoot-em-up. Seriously, more people should play this game. There is a demo on Steam. I strongly urge you to play it."

Each weapon also has a charge part to it.  Making the weapon system a bit like a combination of R-type and Radiant Silvergun.  The unlockable ships all have variations on the same weapon types but still manage to be useful.  Movement feels great and bullets are abundant enough that you feel there's enough going on without being too overwelmed.  In this regard the game isn't really considered a Bullet hell.BADUnfortunately there are quite a few problems with the game as a whole.  The scoring system is something that I think could have used some more work to make it more interesting for Super plays.  And another problem is the graphics... No.  The quality isn't bad.  The issue stems from identifying bullets admist the chaos and knowing what can and can't hurt you.  In most SHMUPs enemy bullets are on the highest layer and are typically a bright colour that you can identify easier.  Some bullets that aren't of the pink ball variety tends to blend in with the explosions and your own bullets.  Leading to moments where you question what just hit you.  The story is there but nothing too special.  I watched the cutscenes once then turned them off personally."

To some the constant changing point of view from horizontal, vertical, behind the craft, and even at an angle will take a while to get used to. Story is muddled and translated poorly in fact there is one section where the game tries to tell you background information while you are dodging bullets. (Who the hell thought this was a good idea is beyond me) The first two weapons cover front and side directions while the last is an auto locking missile launcher which is something more bullet hell games need since now you can focus on dodging. The overall gameplay is cinematic in a genre that only focuses on doing one thing in one direction. So far there is no other game that pulls in off available making this a must buy for bullet hell fans."
,Recommended,214570,4830105,"Posted: 28 August, 2013",all,Capt_Blakhelm,"Buy? Likely. A neat 2.5D doujin shmup that mostly plays in a vertical fashion, but will occassionally switch perspective to horizontal, and even through gameplay moments simlar to Starfox 64 and Rez, using it's 3D capabilities to it's advantage. You can get a better feel of bullet mechanics thanks to the hitbox option. It's great to let you know where you can be hit and where to hit enemies, but it's a bit wonky because the red, circular hitbox overlays are on the upper most layer, so it will be above damn near everything, including cutscene tech. It's worse when there are so many hitboxes on bots - anything with collison has hitboxes, including you and your own damn bullets, so you will see red circles all over the damn screen. Whats worse, a blue hitbox typically means it's a defeated enemy that is exploding into the background, but the hitboxes for actual enemies in the background are still red, so you can't quite tell if something is in the foreground or background until you shoot it. I think it's a better job than Sine Mora IMO, but all you have to go by is depth. Which brings me to the biggest issue of the game, and that is being able to tell what is in the background. You might find yourself dying a bit to enemies shifting to the foreground, and dodging bullets in the background that aren't actually going to hit you yet. Otherwise, the difficulty is is fair and mostly ""your fault if you die"". It's a pure shmup in a sense, so it isn't a bullet hell, but it can almost get there. You don't have powerups, but you rely on a forward gatling gun that can charge a penetrative blast , a laser missle lock on a la Zone of the Enders, and a wide shot that can be charged to release a bullet cancelling bomb, which is great for personal defense and doesn't damage you, but doesn't protect you from collision damage. Soundtrack is good, but nothing award winning. If you're big into shmups, I can recommend it, thought you may want to watch some videos to see if the 3d aspect will bother you."
,Recommended,214570,9934420,"Posted: 25 April, 2014",all,Goldenkitten,"For what it is, a doujin shooter made by a tiny team of people, Ether Vapor Remaster has an amazingly broad scope. The small production cost and team show through in some rough edges but what it gets right it gets REALLY right.The bad first. It has a hitbox that can’t decide what size it wants to be, some bullets have larger areas of effect than it shows, the 3D view means that shots can come from a different plane than you’re on and they can be very difficult to judge (particularly homing shots), and the game has an uneven difficulty shifting between painfully simple and blazingly difficult at times.But its high points drown those low ones out quite handily. A very pretty aesthetic, an interesting (if underdeveloped) story which is exceedingly rare in this genre, good music, and extensive replayability via a host of unlockables.It’s also easily accessible for players of all skill levels; I definitely think this will be my first recommendation to those new to the genre from now on. While other games might have tighter gameplay the fact that you can customize your game via additional credits and shields (unlocked through reaching certain scores, or beating the game) that mean anyone can beat the game through virtually unlimited continues making it perfect for introductory level players. Even for those of us who know the genre this is still a nice addition because it makes learning the later levels much easier since you aren’t immediately booted after making one slip-up as you are in other games. Allowing you to play through the hard parts to see and memorize all the patterns before coming back and beating it the “right” way.In short it’s a great game despite a few missteps, and might well be the perfect game for those just coming to the genre that find some of the hardcore Shmups on Steam just a little too hardcore."

It goes through different types of shooter, from side-scroller to top-down to angled shooter, sometimes on the same level. Mind you, it is one tough frigging game, but awesome and worth its value nonetheless. If you like ""R-Type"" or ""Ace Combat"", or even ""Einhander"", then this one's for you."
,Recommended,214570,4385802,"Posted: 23 January, 2013",all,Shotime,"Ether Vapor: Remaster is an arcade shooter that focuses on being cinematic and challenging.  As shooters go, it's pretty difficult (your hitbox is quite large); although, some of this difficulty can be of the unnatural variety.  For example, a lot of the colors for projectiles run together.  It's extremely difficult to avoid a projectile if it is the same color as the weapons you fire, or is blocked out by your own laser beams.  To partially rectify this, the game allows you to turn on ""hitboxes"", which is nice in theory, but it adds hitboxes to *everything* in the game, including your weaponry and your enemies weaponry.  This helps to allow you to see what's shot at you for *some* projectiles; however, it also clutters up the screen and everything has a red border, so it blocks out other projectiles that weren't very hard to see before.  It's a rock and a hard place, and it's really a shame because it's a major strike against a shmup.  In trying to be cinematic and not make every projectile pink (the best color to use in shmup IMO) they've added an unfair difficulty spike to it.  But, the game is mostly good, hence the recommendation I'm offering for it.  There are two ships to select from (one is unlocked after the game) and you have three modes of firing - Frontal, Side, and Homing - nothing surprising there; however, you can also charge up the weapons for a massive piercing frontal attack, a shield that damages everything caught in it and blocks projectiles and lasers (extremely handy) and a massive AOE homing explosion attack.  Homing attacks are very important in this game.  A unique mechanic of Ether Vapor is that the game is semi-3d, I think it's officially classified as 2.75D.  The perspective changes from top-down, to left-to-right, to even behind the ship (think Star Fox).  It's really neat and is done well, flowing into and out of combat.  There are also really neat periods of time where you use the ships homing lasers to destroy missiles while autopilot is on and you rack up huge points - extremely fun!  That said, another strike against this game is that the Z axis is played with a lot, and it's nigh impossible to determine if enemies are able to be hit by conventional weaponry or if you need to use the homing lock on because they're off your Z-plane.  It can get annoying and the only way to know for sure is experience in the game.  Speaking of experience, this game teaches you how to play it pretty well.  It seems extremely unforgiving as you need to start over every time you play, but in reality you get better, learn the levels, and you unlock more continues and more ""shields"" (hits you take before you need to continue again) as you play.  So it eases you into the game and it makes what at first seems daunting and impossible easier as time goes on.  I felt it was paced really well and still kept its arcade roots, unlike other shmups like Sine Mora.  After beating the game, besides the new ship you also unlock Boss Rush mode that adds replayability.  You also unlock ""extras"", which is really just a link to a Japanese-only website, so that's kin of a bummer.  The switching of weapons and arcadey style is really reminiscent of Ikaruga, and if you enjoyed that game you'll probably like this one.Pros:CinematicFunVaried/Useful weaponryPacingChallengingCons:""Cluttery""Z-Axis woesLack of leaderboards (and personal ones don't work quite to my satisfaction either)All in all this is a difficult shooter that has a lot of fun and fast paced action.  Even a veteran will find himself challenged by this game and new players can get eased in and earn more continues but still feel like a bad♥♥♥♥♥since there is only one difficulty level.  There's a story as well, but like most Japanese shooters it's not much of note.  I'd buy this if you like shooters, but note it's not the best one I've played.  B+"

At the end it can't achieve the precision of 2d shooters, nor the inmersion of the 3d ones.When the game gives the idea of highlighting  hitboxes you know there is something wrong.The main problem is the bullets. its color. the enemy bullets mix with the backgroundand the effects. you have to force your sight to see them. This is especially anoying on the 5th and final stage when the bosses start shooting voleys of small purple-grayish bullets  which are the same color as the background.Then comes the perspective. On the same stage, the game changes the perspective like 10 times, leaving you confused and dizzy and at the verge of a seizure. And it gets even worse when you combine this with the bullets problem. You don't know what's on the same plane as you and can kill you and what is over or under you.Come on, I am trying to play! If I'd want to see spaceships shooting at each other in some weird angles I'd watch some mecha anime."

,Recommended,214570,11939279,"Posted: 31 August, 2014",all,DRUNK_CANADIAN,"Ether Vapor Remaster is a shoot em up/bullet hell game which clearly has a lot of effort poured into it, especially versus others of its genre. The game's story is weak although there is at least an effort to convey it through the game itself and the visuals of the game are superb. The game hops between top down/horizontal and what I can only describe as a fixed camera perspective as you shoot your way to victory, this combined with the beautiful visuals and pseudo 3D feel make for a stunning experience. The cons to this game are debatable in itself, the game has what I would describe as a questionable progression mode, someone odd ""firing mode"" mechanics and a steep difficulty curve which will put off those not familiar with the genre. I struggle to play this game and the questionable hitboxes seem to detract from the experience, that being said the game is an extremely well done shoot em up despite these flaws. I recommend this game with a warning that it is a bit unforgiving however those who are fans of the genre and don't mind some trial and error progression (memorizing enemy patterns) will get a good shoot em up experience."

Gorgeous 3D models with 2D gameplay that shifts from vertical to horizontal action and some chase cam sequences. The mechanics are solid and fair, the hitboxes feel good and the weapons systems are versatile and powerful with excellent situational mechanics. The gameplay is about optimal placement, there isn't any weaving through bullet mazes. Scoring is based on enemies destroyed and time to clear on bosses and mini-bosses. Finally you can opt completely out of all of the anime style dialogue scenes that occur at various points in the stages. If you ever enjoyed shmups this is something you should take a look at."

Well, only 30-40 mins for one playthrough, if that matters.A typical japanese shump - colorful and has great OST selections. As for the gameplay, it's simple - shoot and stay alive until the end. At first you'll be struggling to reach next levels due to limited lives/continues, but as you keep playing you'll stack more allowing you to progress further.The real challenges in the game is to get the next high scores. And bosses. Megarachne and the final bosses are particularly unfair with their attack patterns, nearly unavoidable so yeah that's why you need enough lives. It's bullet hell and requires reflex memory to avoid the incoming attacks. Best played with gamepad - tested the game with Rumblepad and F310 and they're working properly.And oh, need story review? Don't think it matters much, you're not going to pay attention to the story while playing anyway.

There are variations between levels that make this game an up-down Danmaku game, and side-to-side Danmaku game. Since this is usually a topic debated between Danmaku fans; you'll get the best of both within this game.

Coming from doujin roots, Ether Vapor's unique feature is frequent style and perspective changes. At times the visuals make it difficult to distinguish between enemy attacks from background noise, which in this genre is unacceptable. It has no powerups or additional weapons aside from the three you begin with, so it's also fairly simplistic. Yet despite these flaws I find it oddly compelling and really have grown to love it. Maybe it's the very attractive visual aesthetic or maybe after so many years of more traditional formats the gimmicks draw me in, I don't know."

Fans of this genre need to have this in their collection.What makes this quirky is you play levels as either horizontal or vertical...which changes it up as opposed to keeping it one way in all levels, also the enemies can attack in both 2d and 3d which makes the action more varied and less predictable.You also have 3 weapons to start with, all 3 have a charge function too which needs to be ulilised as the action can get quite intense.,..so its not as easy as just firing and killing.  Good level of difficulty not super hard but not a walk over....and as you play you can unlock more continues, more shields and ships.Ive not completed it yet, however im very much enjoying this port of one of my favourite old school 2d shooters."
