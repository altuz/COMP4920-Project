,Recommended,214590,11330571,"Posted: 20 July, 2014",all,Bokxie,"Fairy Bloom Freesia is a game well loved for it's combat mechanics, but other elements also makes me want to recommend this game so much.I'll start with the combat. It's pretty difficult for me to explain, but it has the gameplay of Action RPG games like Tales of, but much more simplified, which isn't necessarely a bad thing. The only disadvantage to this gameplay is that there are only a few enemies throughout the game which just come back with different color schemes.You fight as an anime fairy forest girl who is protecting said forest from bad things. There is no exploration though, as you just fight enemy waves with bosses after a select amount. Don't worry though, after every wave you go back to the intermission, where you can equip and upgrade skills, and save so you can take a break from the game. A shout out to Edelweiss for making some really good and interesting boss battles, with the exception of the first boss.The graphics and music are really appealing, but that might be different according to your taste. Another thing I like is personal, but a big reason why I love this game. It comes in the form of references, though some are incorrect. For example, the main girl is not a reference, but looks and acts like one of my favorite Anime characters ever called Last Order. And lets not forget the achievement which is a direct reference to Madoka Magica, one of my favorite Animes of all time.This game also has a great replay value. After you have completed the main story, several different modes unlock, with much more challenges than you have faced before in this game.I might be a little biased when it comes to this game because it had several things that I look forward to in a game. But these are somewhat personal preferences, so I'd advise you to check out the demo first. And if you enjoyed the demo, then you will for sure enjoy the game."

I love how every action and skill for this game, the boss was quite challanging and the gameplay was pretty decent. The controls are good, people highly recommand you to play this using a controller but it's not like you really needed it. I played the game using keyboards only and still find it fun. The storyline for this game was quite short, but I wasn't really into the story. There weren't many bugs except that if you update the game, then it just destroy the game for you. The graphic was nice, I like how every skill you cast and has that effect for it. The music for this game was beautiful as well, main menu theme are my favorite so far.

Imagine the endless enemy mode of a Super Smash Bros. game.Okay, maybe that's not that fun of an experience to think about paying money for but this game shines in the depth of its combat system. Controls are suprisingly similar to Smash Bros. but with lots of room for the customization of your set of ""special"" moves.Fairy Bloom Freesia does have its flaws though, a really short story mode with predictable characters and THE TWO (the big one and the small one) enemies being the most noticable. There are challenging boss fights to mix things up from time to time but also annoying protect-the-big-glowing-orb missions thrown in as filler for a game already lacking in any exciting content.Overall, this is a game to just lose yourself in. A game to put yourself on auto-pilot to and amaze yourself with 999 combos and juggling for dayz.Note: A couple of the steam achievements are either translated poorly from japanese or bugged to the point where you can actually get them to count. Another mild annoyance."

76561197991895839,Recommended,214590,12812861,"Posted: 5 November, 2014",all,Blindga,"In short: It's a fun little game. Definitely one of the better ones on my list.By no means is it perfect, but it has plenty of charms going for it.Good:I liked how fluid and easy the combat system is. Punches, kicks, slices, bashes, and magic bolts all flow into each other well in what is, essentially, a free form combo system. Smack enemies around however you want using an array of acquired skills and special moves; primarily with the goal of locking enemies into painful juggle combos and smashing them into the hordes for group damage. It is quite satisfying to high kick an enemy into the air, use a Ether Saber uppercut, and then Reverse Spin kick them backwards into the row of enemies behind you.There are also some rpg aspects there; but it's not really developed. You get experience and 'level up' but it's not all that noticable. You do however get to buy upgrades and equip new special skills and passive skills to change your style and tweak your game. A fair variety of magic attacks, melee skills, and useful passives lets you come up with quite a few interesitng combinations, and with the free form combo system included it's hard to imagine the sheer number of attack patterns and strategies at your disposal.It's a good challenge too! Surprisngly difficult and unforgiving at times for such a cute theme. Bosses have a whole repertoire of special moves that they can play on random, and are quite capable of keeping up with the agile little fairy brawler. Hordes of faceless mobs will pummel you to the ground, shoot you mercilessly, and all together are quite capable of overwhelming the heroine and knocking her out in seconds. It's a game you have to stay on your toes with.The music is also good and plays well to the different settings. There is also some japanese voice acting, so that's cool I guess?And the game is cute. Freesia's a sweetheart to be sure. But if you aren't into anime stuff then there's not much story or lore going on anyways. Cutscenes are pretty barebones with still graphics and text that are overall pretty short, with in game animated scenes lasting only a second or two. Everything else is pretty much left up to the player's imagination. Characters are kind of interesting in personality and design, but you really don't see enough of them to make it count. It's overall standard anime/fantasy story stuff, and that works for me.Bad:The game is painfully short. Can be beaten in under an hour if you're fast. Maybe two or three hours on the higher difficulties where you'll be taking your time. For such a sweet and well developed game, it ends quickly and becomes repetitive soon after; albiet still quite amusing.Repetitiveness is the main problem here. It's not terrible, but defintely the weakest point in this game. There are only five main arenas to fight on, and only four enemy types(short, tall, flying, and giant). Some enemies develop into sub-species with alternate attacks, but for most of the game you'll be facing hordes of the same four faceless enemies again and again. It doesn't help that the first boss is just a bulked up version of a regular enemy as well (thankfully the remaining human boss fights are much more diverse).There is also a sort of endless quest mode, called 'Guardian Mode', that has you try to fight for 99 levels of randomly selected waves, but that's even more repetitive.  Sometimes I ended up clearing a level only to fight the exact same lvel setup right after; there's not even much variety in the randomized stages!It is a little slow in the beginning too, when you don't have any basic skills upgraded (and with the first boss not really being that hard), you're stuck using the same moves over and over, and it's easy to get a bad first impression for the game. Things don't start getting interesting until the second arena, but with the game being as short as it is that is a huge minus.But with the lack of diversity in the challenges aside, it's still a pretty fun game.Overall: I would have liked a little more variety and challenge, and maybe even a little more story as this game is quite charming despite being relatively simple.  The rpg mechanics could have been a bit more interesting too, but I won't exactly criticize that.It's a simple beat-em-up about a cute fairy trying to save her tree that features a pretty awesome free form combo system that lets you smash around enemies and tear apart hordes of faceless golems in whatever fashion you want. Despite it's cute theme and repetitive challenges, it is quite difficult and quite fun to play. A ""can pick up and finish in an hour"" short, but still good fun while it lasts. There are multiple difficulties, plenty of skills to master and try out, a new game+ mode, and an endless mode too if you want a little extra fairy fighting action.It's just plain fun, and cute as a button to boot. I recommend it, especially for the low price. If you like beat 'em ups then there's no reason not to give this one a swing."
,Recommended,214590,10600333,"Posted: 21 June, 2014",all,TheComboAddict,"Alright, just so you know what you are getting yourself into, I've played way too many fighting games to count, I love combo crazy and challenging beat em ups and hack and slash games such as God Hand, but there's nothing I love more than when a game gives you so much freedom to release the combo cancelling ♥♥♥♥♥ in yourself.Fairy Bloom Freesia in short is literally like taking: Super Smash Bros or Kirby's simple controls (or Project M turbo mode in general); general things we fighting gamers love in fighting games (cancel combos, parries, etc); Devil May Cry/Bayonetta with its combo craziness of aerial raves, jump cancelling, dodge canceling, air dash cancelling; and then taking God Hand's customization of the moveset and its experimental ways of combos and cancels. Put all these into one, and you get Fairy Bloom FreesiaSimilar to God Hand, the story doesn't necessarily take itself to serious as they make jokes to some popular memes and even stereotypes of characters commonly found in games occasionally. There are even some achievements that are callouts to other game franchises such as Devil May Cry like the Aerial Rave achievement. In fact, even most of the design in the game isn't anyhting to crazy in terms of backgrounds and stages because the concentration is all on you having fun and exploiting the gameplay mechanics to your advantage, just the way God Hand did. This game literally wants to have fun with the freedom it gives you to make plenty of dream combos.The stage design of the game kinda takes a little bit from Smash Bros being a small arena that monsters spawn in with some platforms here and there that you can jump on. While some backgrounds look pretty, you'll notice some repeated objects or just nothing much because the game wants to keep you in the moment of the fight. These stages will be repeated an amount of times, (5 I think), before you fight the boss of the section which can prove challenging if you don't practice up on your just guards, dodges, and cancels (not cancelling out of moves can leave you open sometimes.)The controls are very simple to grasp and work flawlessly with the game....especially when you cancel them combos. Just don't be afraid to experiment. Moves don't always have to chain into another move, you can chain straight into a dodge if you need to keep yourself from getting attacked.Rpg elements are included in the game in which you level up getting experience from defeating monster, and also gain mana which can be used to upgrade your normal moveset, gain special moves that can be set to your special attack directions, and passive abilities such as HP boost, berserker (probably super armor), and reducing how much guard crush guage is filled when attacked. Stats also increase with each level up, though, whether the stats gained are random or not, that I cannot confirm.This is honestly a great game to unwind and relax with especially for fighting game, beat em up, and hack n slash lovers. The freedom of being able to just go wild and make long cancel combos is just a beautiful dream. However, there is one flaw with the game in which the combo meter does not go away after you stop attacking and even if you get hit in the middle of a combo. It lasts about 5 seconds before it actually leaves. This in a way is a flaw but almost seemed necessary to reach the 1000 hit combo achievement for those who can't ""dante must die"" the game. It also make its possible to get a pretty high score through less effort for veterans of these games, though, sometimes you'll drop said combo trying to reach a far off enemy. This hardly affects the gameplay otherwise.If this game is on sale...do not hesitate to buy it. heck, even if it wasn't on sale, the demo would have convinced me to buy it full price. But what really sold me, because I'm Captain Sheepy...is that ""Tetsuzanko"" Is a special ability. (Akira Yuki's back strike....Bayonetta?...Yun from Street Fighter 3?....Kyo Kusanagi? Paul Phoenix?...you know, what people call the shoulder charge?)"

There are 2 modes, story and guardian (which unlocks after beating the story once), as I said the story is rather short but lets you get a good grasp on how to play, and guardian mode is just wave after wave of enemies which is a nice treat.It's a nice game, with a pretty nice soundtrack, and quite cheap so I would definately recommend getting it.Oh and if you do get it, don't let it update to v112 when it prompts on start-up in a seperate window, that will apparently screw the game up as it was a japanese-only update or something."
76561198128371609,Recommended,214590,31757379,Posted: 14 May,all,Emuser,"Fairy Bloom Freesia is a game that is played in a 2D plane but with 2.5D graphics.  People would call a beat-em-up or hack n' slash with bits of platforming and RPG thrown in. I must say that I was not expecting anything out of this game (curiosity finally struck since I had bought the Edelweiss' Fairy Bloom + Ether Vapor Double Pack, mainly for Ether Vapor) but I am glad as all hell I spent the extra $3 for that Double Pack.Gameplay involves fighting mobs in arenas, between each day you can invest the mana you earn to learn new normal moves or unlock special moves, any of which can be assigned to neutral, left/right, down, or up + special button.  There is a decent amount of customization thanks to the freedom of assigning special moves in this fashion.  Lots of combos are possible out of everything you can put together.  The game is fairly challenging, and ramps up really quick so a personal tip from me to you: forward + basic attack cancelled into a guard is a quick effective move that can be done repeatedly which is good against big enemies or bosses not stunned by regular hits.  You net hits and have the ability to block shortly after your attack when needed but there is some technical prowess to it if you want to do numerous cancels in a short period of time.There is replayability in the form of additional difficulties that are unlocked when clearing the hardest difficulties available to you at a time.  There are a fair amount of special moves to work with too, so there is some experimentation to be had until you find the perfect mix.  New game+ does exist to let you carry over unlocks to the next playthrough.There is an oddly satisfying feeling to zipping around all over the screen slapping mobs silly as a little fairy girl, something I honestly thought I would never find myself saying about any game.  It isn't very long for one playthrough assuming you don't get stuck on one boss for too long, maybe a couple hours the first time.  It's a fun little hidden gem, not too long so that it overstays it's welcome, but short enough that you don't get too frustrated at the challenge. If an anime 2D beat-em-up with decent challenge that lets you swing enemies around like silly sounds like your kind of thing, go for it."

That being said, the game itself is lots of fun, and stays fun even when you replay the game to try it on higher difficulties, or to try out different game modes, or to earn more achievements.

Mood,"A deceptively action-heavy beat-'em-up with a little i-frame dodging and combos and parry-like guards and blahblah.The entire thing's short in content from the simplistic plot to the level arenas to the fairy protagonist herself. The graphics and artwork ain't exactly top-notch.I don't know if it's just me but for whatever reason, when looking at the control settings, all I saw was the control layout for a controller. It seemed doable with a keyboard but playing with a controller appeared more appropriate anyway for a game like this.On my end, some of the font is broken. Some letters and special characters are replaced with a white rectangle as opposed to something normal. Apparently my fix for that was to set my system's locale to Japanese.The base game, its Story Mode, doesn't take more than a few hours to complete and is much shorter if attempts at skipping the cutscenes is made. The way it goes with Story Mode is that you go through levels, or ""Days"", fighting waves of baddies, which don't even come in many varieties anyway aside from a color difference that dictates what's a weaker or stronger version of what enemy. Sometimes you'll also be protecting one or three of these ""Vortex"" things from enemy damage until the level's over.For every 5 days, it's a boss battle and then a map change the next day. Aside from maybe the first boss they're pretty engaging with how fast they can be if you're not careful and it helps that they become a good change of pace from the possible repetitiveness of doing the same kind of levels over and over again.Days themselves don't take very long to complete and after a day's through you immediately go through an ""Intermission"" state where you can train, save progress, and buy & upgrade skills using the ""Mana"" dropped from baddies as currency.The skills are categorized in 3 sections; Basic, Special, & Optional where the last two must be equipped manually. The Basic skills add new attacks to your regular combos where you're to use the right buttom prompts to properly perform. One of the Basics is a ""perfect guard"" of sorts where if an attack is guarded at the right time the attack meter doesn't fill up, which when it does breaks your guard and damage is inflicted to you. The Special skills are basically active attack skills that are activated depending on which of the four possible Special skill slots they're equipped on. Each specific slot is supposed to be something like where a Special skill is added to the slot that has [Up + Special Attack] and then that attack would only activate with the specified combination. The Optional skills are essentially automatically activated passive skills of sorts mainly consisting of buffs which you can only equip two of.The only way to figure out exactly how helpful each active skill is is to test them out in a fight. Since there were so many Basic and Special skills I didn't really bother figuring out all of them and just kept sticking to what was already helpful and replacing what wasn't.All attacks & combos themselves are simple & fast and aren't very hard to pull off. The Basic and Special skills being a little more simpler to use so it's just a matter of using them at optimal times.In addition to the game's sub-par graphics most enemies fire projectiles of sorts that use a glow-y effect of some kind. Amidst the likely chaos from duking it out with the waves of enemies, there's going to be a some fancy effects that occur making many of these projectiles likely difficult to even notice. Often times they'll phase through enemies that can lead to completely unnoticed damage to you.It's apparently pretty easy to get stunlocked mid-air and easier when baddies just start raining down. As far as I know there isn't an ""air recovery"" of sorts to compensate for that.The replayability relies on the increased difficulty modes for Story Mode and a Guardian Mode. Guardian Mode is basically just the same objectives only there are 99 days in total, 3 continues, tougher enemies as you get further in, and intermissions only come every somethingnumber days depending on how far you're in to it.If not just repetitive it ain't too bad of a short & simplistic beat-'em-up."

,Recommended,214590,10329168,"Posted: 2 June, 2014",all,Webkun,"I haven't played a brawler this responsive since ever.You are the baddest fairy of the forest and you get to shank some fools while shooting magic and dodging and blocking your way to the next day, where you can do the same thing again.This game is combination of the combat system of Super Smash Bros (the block break mechanic, the perfect block mechanic, and the dodge step mechanic, and the basic fighting mechanics)and Devil May Cry (999 COMBOS, ABSOLUTELY INSANE SPECIAL MOVES, FLASHY EFFECTS; HELLO, DELIVERY? ONE ORDER OF CRAZY PLEASE)The story is not anything profound and you should just mash the next button through the dialogue. The combat system is deep with a customized special skill loadout (you can have 4 equipped at any time and theres about 20 to choose from). The enemy variety is unfortunately lacking, as most small budget games from small studios, they usually skimp out on the art assets of the game. Theres like 4 or 5 main enemies that just get recolored throughout the game, however they DO get new attacks as the game goes on, so the variety is actually a bit better than it may originally seem. Even though the enemy models may be few (and in some cases boring or ugly), Freesia (the main character) and the bosses are all unique and look sufficiently pretty. The character designs are kept simple and I personally think it works pretty well. What they did NOT skimp out in in the art aspect are the absolutely gorgeous particle effects which really help drive the feel of the action home. The cutesy anime art style is understandably offputting and doesn't mesh with the typical target demographic of this game at all, and may be hard for a lot of people to look past. I personally don't mind it at all and think it give the game just a hint of charm to it (similar to Recettear), but if you're not particularly into the Japanese art style then the overall asthetic just isn't for you most likely.Speaking of Japanese, the game comes fully playable in Japanese and English. The English translations are good enough for the skill descriptions and tutorials. I can't speak for the story as I skipped over most of it, but I assume it was also competently done as well. However, no matter what language you decide the text to be in, the spoken language is always Japanese. As a Japanese language hobbyist, this again doesn't really matter to me, and probably shouldn't matter TOO much for anyone else either (everyone loves to play as Marth or Roy in Smash Bros, and they only talk Japanese). Just be prepared to be hearing Freesia yell ""IKUZO!"" all the time (Which is the equivalent to some dude yelling ""HERE WE GO!"" every time he punches someone). The Japanese seem to like particularly vocal characters, Freesia and the humanoid bosses not being exempt from this. It would have been nice if they gave them subtitles though (which they did not).Long story short, theres a special ability that lets you launch an enemy into the air with a double butterfly kick, encase them in a ball of magic and LITERALLY slam dunk them into the rest of the enemies on the ground, making sure to do a few flips on the way down for good measure.Get this game (when its on sale)."

The game itself, isn't very long, but the combat stages are very fun and enjoyable. The story could use some work, but I think the main purpose of this game is for the player to basically just fight. Freesia's (the faery) moves are very fluid and easy to combo with, I feel that the enemies could use a bit of variety. I'm pretty sure the game is finished, but it'd be nice to see the developers make another game similar to this one. They could implement special powers for the future protagonist to have in addition to their martial abilities.The controls for the keyboard are a little finicky and require a bit of preparation before playing. In addition, the key are marked as, ""Key 1"", ""Key 2"", etc., so it is a little confusing as to what key you're actually using.

With its anime theme and its wide array of skills, spells, and buffs, players will suddenly find themselves completing their first play through only to jump back in to unlock what they couldn't do during the first run.  The skills reward the player with blur effects, screen shaking, bright lights, and loud percussive explosions and generally feel really good as they're slicing through their targets.  With an EXP per kill system that is used to unlock spells, players are tasked with chaining the most absurd amount of combos in an attempt to hit the mother load that never ceases to entertain.  The story is very light, however, and can be finished in an hour or two.  There are also very few enemies and gameplay may get stale after noticing that monsters in the final levels are the same as the roster from the first.

It seems like a game that'd be on Dreamcast in that it's arcadey, colorful and easy to pick up. Think of this as a beat-em-up in the style of Streets of Rage, albeit with more of a focus on combos and a story mode that feels like survival mode in some other games. You can unlock various skills and level them up using mana, allowing you to equip your character according to your preferred combat style. There's a decent amount of depth here.Also, for anyone who's wondering, this game runs surprisingly well on laptops. You'll probably get a lot of slowdown, but only during flashier combos."

Once you clear the game you open up 'Hard' difficulty and Guardian Mode, as well as some extras under the Gallery option. Plenty of ""award"" challenges to keep completionists busy for probably 30 hours more.Guardian mode is pretty much a gauntlet mode, only allowing intermissions every couple days or so and spawning many more enemies per day than the Story mode's stages usually do.The skill system enables a wide variety of playstyles and makes you think about what you want to use for the next round. However as you play the game more, you'll find out which skill combos work best for most situations.My main gripe about this game come from how little there is in terms of variety of enemy. You fight golems and the occasional boss. These golems get more difficult as you progress through the game. This is signified by their change in colour. Very samey."

Sometimes the game felt extremely hard even on normal difficulty, but that just made it even more thrilling once you beat those parts. Timing your blocks is very important, but if your block gauge is about to shatter it becomes all about dodging to keep your defense strong.

If you've ever had the pleasure to play on an actual arcade machine before, this game looks and plays just like one. Its not the most amazing ground breaking sidescroller fighter no, but it is fun and extremely well done for what it is.I had never heard of either Fairy Bloom Freesia or its original concept Fairy Bloom (a open source Japanese indie game) until I happened to do a Steam store search for “fairy.” I waited for it to go on sale as the game didn't look like much and there were numerous reports of bugs for the game in the other reviews.(*Important Note: the developers did release patches to fix all the bugs, and I haven't ran into any)Needless to say I was surprised when I opened up the game for the first time. It wasn't anything mind boggling, but it immediately gave off the arcade game style which was quite the throwback. The first problem was that there was no options to change the keyboard controls, only the controller controls. It took quite a while to figure all the controls out, but once I did it was very easy to learn combat. The menus being easy to use was a huge help.The soundtrack is amazing, the voice acting for Freesia is amazing. Sadly she is the only character to get voice acting, but that's forgivable as the story mode is quite short and there are only 6 characters total in the game. Its a short story mode, but fighting games are not known for their great story modes, and the usual trend is the longer the story modes get the more bloated and confusing they get. The story mode in this game being short and generic actually helps it in this case. The original game had NO story after all.The second mode is Guardian Mode, which is a wave style more arcade-like mode. You have to go through 100 maps, each with increasing difficulty and amount of enemies, with stronger versions of the bosses mixed in. Its not drastically different but it does add to the replay value.There are hard modes for both game modes, and you can choose to have your upgrades and unlocked skills carry over! You can also choose not to carry them over if you want to make it harder on yourself. The NG+ on both modes increases the enemy health, damage, and quantity. It will punish you with enemies comboing you to death if you don't have a good grip of the controls. One bad mistake = death.The graphics are great and the background ambiance is great too. Unfortunately there are only a handful of enemy types that just get pallet swapped in each of the 5 levels. But each type of enemy is unique from each other. There is also only one or two maps for each level, and they get reused for the bosses with the exception of the final boss. Keep in mind this is an indie game with a small development team.Combat is a lot more intense then you would expect. This is because the enemies can ragdoll off each other, and its common to have several enemies literally pinballing around the screen in a fight. They implement this into the combo system, so the more enemies you have bouncing off each other the more you can hit them to keep your combo going. This is made more fun by the satisfying whack sound they make when they slam into each other. Though it can get into earrape territory when you have a lot of them going at the same time.The skill and leveling system is bigger then you would expect for an indie game. The abilities use your energy meter and the stats/skills are always on once you pick them. Leveling all of these use the same experience you pick up when defeating enemies, so you definitely wont be able to unlock it all on the first run though. Thankfully as mentioned before the upgrades do carry over into NG+.There are a couple dozen different abilities you can unlock each with varying usefulness based on your playstyle. One you definitely want to get is the blink, which gives you a get out of jail free card when the enemies inevitably stunlock you into a corner. It also makes the bosses much easier as they can and will teleport themselves, usually right into a combo on you.SummaryI am very glad that I found this little gem of a game. The soundtrack is amazing, the voice acting is amazing, the graphics are amazing. In my opinion it is worth full price as it has much charm and content for an indie game its size. If you love classic arcade fighters or sidescrollers you really should pick up this game, even if its on a sale. If you wanted a new wifu or two you should also pick up this game, as Freesia's voice acting really is top notch. Sure the story mode is short, but it doesn’t overstay its welcome either. There's also the wave mode which is fun when you want to mindlessly smash enemies all over the screen. There's also enough of a difficulty spike to make NG+ on both modes worth it giving it replay value. The limited map and enemy verity don't detract much from the game either. Fairy Bloom Freesia also hits the most important checkbox: Its just plain fun!"

I had fun playing it, because the gameplay itself was quite entertaining but you are mostly fighting the same 4 kinds of monster and the ones that appear the most are the small ones and the tall ones. The flying ones an the big golems appear in some levels, but the big golems don't appear as much. This lack of variety can make the game quite repetitive but once you get the hang of the game, the levels go by pretty quickly.The boss fights are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t hard. In the second boss fight I did, I may have simply not performed well because I wasn't entirely used to the combat system. The problem is, the human or fairy opponents can still attack you while being attacked while every other enemy and Freesia, can not attack whilst being hit. This puts you at a clear disadvantage because while you are trying to hit the opponent, and often succeeding, they will suddenly kick your♥♥♥♥♥Fighting the first female boss who shoots projectiles took me a long time to beat since she can just spam projectiles at you the whole time and it gets pretty unfair. Again, she can also still throw projectiles and hit you while being hit herself. There is also a large gap in the difficulty between the regular enemies, and the boss fights as the regular enemies are extremely easy while the boss fights are extremely hard.On the plus side, the character models for the humans and fairies are quite good and some of the backgrounds are really nice. The arenas seem to get bigger progressively with more platforms to jump on which can help strategically as well.One thing I didn't like about this game, was the artwork for the sort of Visual Novel style bits (where they tell the story). The artwork looks like the kinds of stuff I drew as a 16 year old and not something I would expect to see in a game of this quality. I think to be honest, the game would have been better without the visual novel sections entirely because the story is not very entertaining and the sprites look pretty bad. Freesia's sprite looks good when compared with the others but could still use improvement.6/10 - It was satisfying to finish, but overall it isn't one of the best games. When you consider the price though, it is definitely well worth it."

The total amount of people that worked on this game seemed to be around 13 people based from the credits (and that's including all of the voice actors LOL).

FBF could be classified as a single-stage brawler with combat similar to Super Smash Bros, of all things! Unfortunately, it's held back by some pretty glaring issues.The primary feature of this game is the combat, which managed to surprise me in the fact that it seems very one-dimensional on the surface, but quickly becomes frustrating if all you do is button-mash. The game is broken up into small stages, wherein you fight a great number of very squishy, very bouncy enemies. At first it's a blast to just knock them around into each other, but can become overwhelming with the amount of projectiles that can be flying around. Then come the boss fights, which require a great deal of finesse to master and can be gamepad-chuckingly difficult. I suggest 2 approaches: button mashing and flinging moves for the masses, and stamping the block button any time the bosses even twitch.The plot is fairly typical japanese stuff filled with fairly typical japanese characters and the RPG elements are the typical japanese grind. The only substance comes from the combat, but there are simply too many things going on to really feel like you are controlling the fun. When you do finally get a good rhythm, though, it can be heaps of fun. But then it ends, cuz this is a fairly short game. At least there's ""New Game +"" if you're not quite ready to put it down yet."
,Recommended,214590,4830106,"Posted: 14 September, 2013",all,Capt_Blakhelm,"TL;DR: It's a cutesy, singleplayer brawler that plays similarly to Super Smash Bros with RPG elements, but with out as much polish and refinment of the combat. It is very enjoyable, though is at times more fustrating that it should be. FBF is fairly short and offers replayability through NG+.Buy? Maybe. It's an almost too cutesy, Super Smash Bros style brawler set in the Jomon forest, a place dependent on the power of a magical stone that is protected by Freesia. Combat is similar to Smash Bros where you have a simple attack/combo button, jump button, block button and special attack button based on the direction you press.The neatest aspect of this is the ability to customize the specials from a wide variety of moves including projectiles, ground smashes, anti-air moves and more. It is presented in an RPG fashion, as more specials unlock as you level up and complete levels. This does mean that you have to figure out which moves you like or need prior to each Day (level), as some are not effective in some situations (especially moves that only work in the air or only work on ground, leaving Freesia doing nothing and wide open to attack, which isn't a problem in SSB). You can unlock all basic attacks, but you have a limit of two ""passive buffs"" that you can apply. This doesn't make sense to me because there are so many of these buffs and at many times, I feel like I lose so much because I can't use a couple more. Thankfully, the game will tell you if you're up against a boss or protecting a vortex in the next fight.The combat is nowhere near as good as SSB. Combos feel good and satisfying, but often are easily interuppted by a near extreme multitude of projectiles thrown by offscreen enemies, requring you to block mid-combo to prevent damage (this may be why the combo reset timer is a bit forgiving). That same block, like SSB, can be broken if you are attacked too much, but it's shown under your HP bar in the upper left corner of the screen, instead of on Freesia, requiring you to take your eyes off the action in intense fights - VERY BAD. Offscreen enemies are a huge nuisance when they are shooting so much while you're dealing with melee enemies - you don't have the ability to deal with it, especially when your block doesn't let you evade out of the way like SSB, just hop around. Bosses never flinch like you do when you are hit mid combo (except when you beat them down to certain points of their health), so you spend most of the time in boss fights playing defensively and nicking at their HP with 2-3 hit combos, so you aren't juggled (while they can also break the block, which is your only real means of defense). I mention offscreen enemies - that means the camera is fixed on Freesia's location, which is not a problem until there enemies beyond the bounds of the screen that can ruin your day - or enemies attacking vortexes you can't see.  I got kinda irritated near the end to amost rage quitting, but thankfully, that was the last battle around 3hrs. There's replayability in NG+ and a Guardian mode that some how didn't save after I beat the game because the game crashed when I messed with resolution settings (even though I could access my 2nd save file that occured after beating the game. Oddly, it acted as if it was before the last battle.). I've seen a Dark Freesia, so there might be more bosses or levels.  This game isn't BAD, it's just isn't as polished as the early Smash Bros games. I'd love to see a really good SSB clone, that maybe has some RPG aspects like this, as well as some exploration. It's important to note that Freesias battle yaps are pretty annoying, since she screams with every attack: it may not bother you, but it will probably bother people around you if you play with speakers."

They should not have neglected level design and monster AI. The regular stages all seem an unending slog of motionless targets on relatively unchanging platform orientations. The only difficulty in these portions of the game seems to be the often obscured spew of projectiles that will unavoidably juggle you to death with no chance of recovery beyond the initial hit. That, and perhaps mindlessly keeping track of your own combo count for no other reason than to have a high combo count.The game definitely shines in its boss battles, really forcing the player to fight efficiently with an effective character build. Yet even this can be easily cheesed using broken defensive abilities and homing magic, not to mention the boss battles themselves are far and few between. Most disparagingly, the final boss fight ends up being extremely simple and much easier than earlier ones, regardless of unlocked abilities and player skill, as it still holds true in a higher difficulty mode in NG+ which pits you against a hardier variant of each of the bosses to scale with maxed out stats.It's enough fun for a pick up and play kind of approach, or for anyone who really gets deep into optimal play, but the longevity doesn't extend much further than an achievement farm. I would definetely consider a sequel or extension, but I cannot recommend this game as a complete package."
,Not Recommended,214590,7826761,"Posted: 29 November, 2013",all,Nai,"What in the world did I just play?This game is pretty bad.  I bought it with a coupon, so I'm not terribly bent out of shape, but I still can't give this game much praise.  Ignoring the fact that this game is near unplayable without a controller, the game's set up is terrible.   Basically, you flucuate between two screens.  An 'intermission' screen between each day, where you can spend earned points, and then the combat screen, which is one of several different seasons/mood variations.   This game looks like it was going to be a fairy themed fighting game, but somewhere along the way they dropped the ball on multiplayer and decided to take their fighting arenas and try to inject a story into it at the last second.Beat'em Ups made in the 90s have more variation to them than this game.Most of the enemies are literally reskins of the first few enemies you encounter, with some of the advanced enemies being shrunken versions of bosses, so don't expect to fight a huge variety of enemies.  Also, as far as your actual moves go, you do manage to get an impressive selection of special moves, but none of them are anywhere near as powerful as simply knocking one enemy into another repeatedly, like they were gasoline filled balloons holding matches.Where the game does vary is in its difficulty.  At some point, between Summer and Autumn I think, the game's difficulty spikes.  They remind you that you can 'train' in order to become more powerful in order to complete the day(effectively the levels in the stage), but it amounts to you playing against slightly weaker versions of enemies you've already killed.  Yes, they solve this difficulty spike by letting you grind, giving you very little natural progression.Ultimately, this game brings together the worst parts of several genres.  The static 'stage' from Arcade styled fighting games(minus the multiplayer), the grinding of legacy RPGs(Without the depth of story).  The only thing that I can say that this game does right is how Freesia herself moves and responds to controller input.  If they took Freesia out of this game, and put her into a game with better level design, better flow, and less grind, it could easily be a great game.  Unfortunately, Freesia is tethered to her tree."

The game's story also seems like it may have some interesting ideas.Unfortunately, that's about all I can recommend, as the game just isn't satisfying to play. The combat arenas, while pretty, are repetitive, small, and clausterphobic. The combat, while functional, feels very stiff and can be inconsistently responsive. Every single part (not just special attacks, mind you) of Freesia's moveset is locked off behind a leveling wall, which really doesn't help matters. I mean, progression is fair game, but not when that it compromises the core gameplay loop.The enemies themselves fail to remedy the issue as well. While the basic enemies are nearly brain-dead and incredibly easy to dispatch, when facing a boss, if you intend to stay alive for any period of time, you best block every single of the attacks while you whittle down the incredibly long health bar.Bored.

You lose if every vortex is destroyed.The game has controller support, which is good to have the option, but I don't think it's really an option to NOT use a controller.

There are multiple difficulties unlocked as you beat the Story Mode, and it includes a New Game+ feature where you can start over from the beginning with the skills you had unlocked on previous playthroughs.Guardian Mode is especially fun - you can unlock it after finishing the story mode and it consists of fighting through 99 days of increasingly difficult battles (some of which include fighting bosses...or multiple bosses) and ends with you fighting a special boss, who I won't spoil. Your save data from Story Mode does not transfer over to Guardian Mode.It's definitely fun and definitely worth the money in my opinion. You can find out yourself if you like the combat style by playing through the demo. I never played the demo so I don't know how long it is, but I've heard it's just the tutorial."

Game is pretty.Can play this on old laptops with X3100 graphics.Gameplay has genuine depth and replay value is high.THE BAD:Short story mode.(But replay value is high, so...)Maybe too hard. You need to be a veteran gamer for this one!THE SPECIFICS:The music is fantastic and really sets the mood. First thing I did before playing the game was listen through the whole menu track. Also, the menu is really pretty and the graphics will scale to your resolution which keeps things running fantastically well -- I cleared this game on aDell Inspiron 1525laptop and apart from a slow down here and there it ran really, really smoothly!The difficulty curve goes from naught-to-ninety and then some, but levels out a bit when you learn what you're doing. The story is short, feelng more like a single chapter in length, but it's nice that it's there.The combat is a bit on the hard side until you get to grips with defending and dodging, and even when you do get into the flow you still end up taking damage in seemingly unavoidable ways. The battles are tough for this reason, but after a while you realise that avoiding damage is sort of the name of the game and it becomes all the more fun – I wouldn't call it bullet-hell exactly(it's too chaotic for that)but the game can definitely throw a lot at you. Choosing which skills to use to take down a particular foe gives the game a genuine strategic side, and it's here that you'll find most of Fairy Bloom Freesia's depth. The difficulty can drive a player to rage-quit, but victory is always a different skill choice or better approach away.At less than a tenner it's well worth it, but I stress that this game isn't for beginners! If you enjoy fighting games and games where you can restart with the same high-leveled character at a greater difficulty(Disgaea, Recettear, Diablo, etc), then I'd say this one is for you. If you only ever play through something once, then get it on special offer and you'll still have your money's worth.I just really hope Edelweiss takes the core concepts of this game and expand on it, as the potential is huge."

But once you figure out the controls and get used to them, the game is insanely fun and overall I found myself feeling very satisfied once I crushed all the foes with a combo or destoryed a boss. Its a fun game and on sale or full price. I think its worth it. The storyline is humor and interesting for what little there is. Overall its a classic beat the crap out of everything and feel awesome doing it game."

Since it was on sale I decided to take my chances. I'm glad I did. This game unlike other wave defense games is actually done well, and doesn't get to repetitive either. There is a story, but don't expect it to be anything like a great RPG story or anything. It is alright for a game that doesn't need to focus on its story to keep you interested.  The game is a 2.5D platforming beat 'em up with a defense game play to it. You defeat waves of enemies and progress to the next level. After each level you will be able to choose from a wide verity of magic attacks, regular attacks, and enhancers. Since you only have a limited amount of currency and stat slots, you have to think what will help you the most for future levels. After every boss battle the game stage will change and get more complex and tougher enemies to fight.  The game will start to get harder right around the first boss battle. It's a fun game to get into if your into wave defense type games or beat 'em ups. The music is charming, same goes for its art style."

You could say it's grindy, but it's short, and IMO the amount of grinding you'll need to do doesn't outpace the amount of fun you'll have mastering the system.The demo left me a little concerned about how well the progression mechanic would work, but once I got the full game, everything fell into place. Not too flexible, not too easy.The game's fairly self-aware and doesn't take itself too seriously, and the plot isn't anything mind-blowing, but it's still satisfying to fight bigger and bigger enemies, aiming for higher and higher combos. Reminded me of the combat portions of the Devil May Cry series."

Much like the protagonist, Freesia is a short and sweet, :strictly: combat-centric arena beat-em-up (no platforming!). While Story Mode isn't particularly long, Freesia's New Game+ and Survival Mode equivalents offer a surprising amount of replayability for the price. A fantastic game for combo savants and button mashers alike."

Lots of customization and moves woven into a very simple core combat system that feels liquid smooth. Relatively well-translated dialogue in a sparse and simple but intriguing plot.I'd recommend this for the price it's usually at. If it's on sale, you HAVE to pick it up.Warning: Normal mode is pretty tough! However, reiteration time is very slight and you keep Mana (used to upgrade skills/stats) you gained in-level even upon death, so it's challenging but very forgiving with a very ""one more try!"" feeling. But people who aren't into that kind of challenge shouldn't feel guilty about playing on Easy for their first playthrough!"

If I recall correctly, my total playtime was over 100 hours.The visuals are a little simple, but with very satisfying animations and special effects. The music is also very good. I believe the soundtrack has remastered versions of the tracks, with clearer instruments. Freesia's voice may be a little annoying, but I think you can turn her volume down.The gameplay is a combination of Super Smash Bros and fighting games, with customizable abilities and special attacks. There are many available options to suit all kinds of playstyles. If you're a fan of those games, you should definitely check this game out. It starts out a little slow, but has lots of depth.Last I checked, the English translation is a little wonky here and there (eg. achievement context seemed confusing, a few typos and so on), but it's not too bad.
