That's okay though, because I am too selfish to care.Then there is Male Student. He has a name, but you are supposed to talk to his father, hunt down his name through school and then ignore him not wanting to talk to me by threatening his social life until he joins my club.By doing all of this, I got the good ending."

,Recommended,214610,13038500,"Posted: 22 November, 2014",all,Fruitsniffer,"Warning: Lengthy review incoming!Cherry Tree High Comedy Club is an interactive visual novel with the gameplay of a dating simulator.Before I get into the review, I want you to know, that I played the westernized localization of the game. I’m going to talk about this in a little bit more detail at a later point of this review.You play as Miley Verisse, a young comedy fanatic, who’s planning on forming her very own Comedy Club at her school. Miley’s roommate has already been compelled to join the club, but the problem is that school clubs have a minimum number of required members, which means that Miley has to find three more people to join her club until the end of the club trial period. That means you’ve got two months to manipulate and befriend as many people as possible.This is where the dating simulator gameplay comes in.There are six different characters that can be recruited and you befriend them by talking to them about different topics. You raise your skill levels by reading magazines or visiting places and occasionally you can also find random stuff on the ground that raises your skills as well. The higher your skill for “fashion” for example is, the more the friendship level of a character will be raised when talking to them about this topic.This type of gameplay can get a bit repetitive, since you do the same thing every day. You get up, talk to a character, talk to another character, watch some TV and the day is over. Repeat until some special event happens or until the friendship level of a character rises.To get a character to join your club you have to get them to friendship level 5, which is pretty much impossible to do for all 6 characters in the first playthrough. Fortunately there is a new game+, which allows you to keep all your skills and only resets your friendship levels.The whole game has a lot of jokes, because, you know… Miley’s a comedy enthusiast and stuff.There were some jokes that are right up my alley that I found really amusing and then there were some others that just fell flat for me.The characters are rather diverse and even though some of them seem pretty spineless in the beginning, you find out that they have a really interesting background story after befriending them. On the other hand, there are also some characters that still seem rather spineless after you convince them to join your club and their background story is by far not as interesting as you’d expect.A big problem I had with the game is, that it only supports a resolution of 640x480 and if you want to play it in fullscreen mode, the game window gets stretched to fit the height of your screen and you get two beautiful black bars next to the game to fill your screen. The settings of the game are also pretty limited, but hey, it’s a visual novel and not some fancy AAA game title, so I guess that’s expectable.At the time I bought this game, no original version was available in English, only the westernized version, with different names and locations.With the release of the sequel of Cherry Tree High Comedy Club on Steam we finally get to play the game in English with the original names and the same places as in the Japanese version of the game.For example, Miley turns into Mairu and Cindy suddenly is called Haru. Also, chilli dogs turn into rice omelets, because, you know, western people only know chilly dogs and can’t comprehend rice omelets or something.All those extremely western sounding names feel a bit out of place, because everything feels so Japanese and all those cherry trees in the background for example definitely don’t make me feel like I’m in the US either.I’m going to be completely honest with you: Cherry Tree High Comedy Club was the first visual novel I ever played, so I might judge this game a lot differently than some of you visual novel veterans out there but for someone new to this type of medium, this game was a really good entry point and even if you’re usually not a big fan of those type of games, you might still enjoy all those cute characters and the nice setting.The multiple endings and the new game+ give the rather short game some replayability, since you will not be satisfied with only knowing the background story of for example 3 of the characters but you will want to know the background story of all of them, even though they might not be as interesting as you’d expect.All in all, Cherry Tree High Comedy Club is a pretty decent visual novel for veterans and casuals in this medium. It might have its flaws but it is still a really enjoyable game to waste some time with.If you’re a diehard action fan who needs explosions, headshots and a lot of gore to enjoy a video game, or someone who detests reading and dislikes games that heavily rely on text in general, you might want to sit this one out.Everybody else:Should you play Cherry Tree High Comedy Club?Yes. Yes you should."

,Recommended,214610,16842707,"Posted: 2 July, 2015",all,novalinnhe,"I've never really played a ""visual novel"" style game like this before, but for my first time I really enjoyed the offerings. Cherry Tree High Comedy Club is a feel-good story about Mairu Hibisu, your typical 'I Wanna Be Hokage' type protagonist who dreams of becoming the next big international comedy senstation. Re-opening her school's defunct comedy club is the first stepping stone to her dreams; however, in order to form a club at CTH you need to have at least three members who want to sign up. And this is where the fun comes in!CTHCC is essentially Persona Social Links The Game, but it puts its own cute little twist on things. You run around town discovering new students toharass and blackmail into joining your clubhopefully recruit, and as you get to know each of the students you meet, you'll begin to level up your social standing with them. Get to know them well enough, and they'll eventuallygive in to your constant houndingjoin up.One feature I really liked was how by talking to each character on a daily basis, you start picking up clues as to which converational topics they may or may not like. Some are made obvious, and some not so much. You also do better talking to students by increasing what you know about each of the conversation subjects. There are loads of ways to do this, from heading to the cinema or reading magazines in the library, to spending time at the arcade or listening to that weekend's guest speaker at the art gallery. There's genuinely loads to do all over town and many day/time specific events, which I personally enjoyed as it encourages you to get to know and care about the places & people you're interacting with.I also really loved the variety in each character's story, which starts to unfold as you level up your social standing with them. No story was similar and many were quite serious at times, but the sprites and character art remained adorable throughout, making it pretty hard not to find yourself endeared to everyone by the end. There's also a little re-playability value with the New Game+ mode (where you can start a new game with the stats you built up from the last one), but as CTHCC is just a quick bit of cutesy fun, you probably won't be picking it back up once you're done with itunless you want to see the perfect ending. Would highly recommend this as a great introductory game to the visual novel genre.Quick sidenote: if you're looking for pantsu, this really isn't it. There are absolutely zero romantic interactions with any character, which I was more than happy with but I understand would be a turn-off for some."

This is basically a resource management sim with some social interaction which never really hits home. Presentation is pretty nice, but the rest of the game kind of meanders along and doesn't go anywhere.If you really like the art style and have an urgent need to burn some time, you could do worse, I guess."
76561198129411711,Not Recommended,214610,29552951,Posted: 28 January,all,Inconsistent Gamer,"InCherry Tree High Comedy Club, you play as Mairu, a high school student and aspiring comedian. In order to help bring comedy to the world, she sets out to restore her school's comedy club. But the student council president has a catch. Mairu must recruit at least five members in order to establish a new club. There is already herself and her best friend Hoemi, but she will need three more people to agree to join. Now Mairu must meet new people, make friends, and try to convince them to join her comedy club.As a note for this review, I played the so-called ""un-westernized"" version which retains the original Japanese names and some other cultural references, as opposed to the Americanized version.The main mechanic of this game is that you walk around town, meet people, and try to talk to them and make friends. This is mostly done by honing your conversation skills by learning about subjects to talk about through activities like reading magazines or watching television. You must also pay attention to your own concerns by completing homework on time, minimizing your fatigue level, and managing your money.To start off with some of the positive aspects of this game, I really enjoyed the artwork. The characters and backgrounds are very colorful and this aesthetic is pleasing to look at. The cartoony/anime style of the game really befits the more light-hearted nature of the story. I also liked the music used which is often up-beat.However, I was disappointed with some aspects ofCherry Tree High Comedy Club. The first would be the writing and characterization. While it is never really bad, it all just felt too generic most of the time. There are six potential recruits to chase after, but they mostly seem like clichés that I have seen before. As a result, none of the characters feel very memorable. Also, for a game about starting a comedy club, especially with a main character that loves jokes, I thought much of the humor fell flat.The gameplay also felt weak. I only played for a few hours as of this writing, but it was mostly just grinding in order to try to deepen Mairu's friendship with other characters. This quickly became boring. The general mechanics of the game were never really adequately explained which was frustrating for me. I went through on my play-through thinking I was doing what I was suppose to in order to make friends, but I ended up with a bad ending having failed to recruit a single member.This is not a terrible game and, believe me, I really tried to like it. The art style is very nice and the story is light-hearted, but I thought the gameplay was repetitive and boring with writing and characterization that felt inadequate. I paid the full price for this game and really expected more. Overall, this was just too average at best."

Except instead of dating, you're trying to get them to join your comedy club. It sounds ridiculous, but it works!Miley's a hyperactive girl frantically trying to get three more members to join her club. The downside is people here actually read before they sign stuff, so she needs to get really friendly with them before they join up.The game is freakishly difficult for a dating sim the first time around: unless you have a walkthrough or know exactly what you're doing, you will probably fail. This is not a bad thing. But before you can get New Game+, be prepared to really slog it to just succeed.What kept me hooked was the writing and translation. The dialogue is hilarious; every character has charm and personality, and there are lots of great zingers during conversations. The translators have done a great job bringing this to a Western audience: think of the Samurai Pizza Cats, and you know the way they tackled this.Things I would change: skipping cutscene dialogue - there's a LOT of talking, which makes replaying the game tedious - and making it clear that if you use a conversation topic, it's only good once."

I thought I was doing stuff right then didn't get any recruits at the end so apparently I am missing something. I would recommend looking up a guide before playing if you don't want to play the game over and over to figure out how to actually recruit people.The characters are pretty enjoyable and the pixel art is lovely, but the clunkiness of the game was too detracting for me. After I finished my playthrough and getting ""closer"" to a bunch of characters many times, I got 0/5 recruits I am very confused on how I was expected to play this game.I think if you're looking to try out a visual novel game there are better ones out there.

(One example: ""I see now ... So that's why I like cannoli. That makes sense."" ""Wh... What are you talking about?"" ""It makes total sense."" ""Don't just end a conversation like that!"")That said, each of the major characters also has their own full story arc with actual emotional weight, ranging from coping with loss to coping with corporate encroachment. These topics are handled with surprising sensitivity, and display Mairu (Miley in the Westernized version) as more than a mere player avatar, with her own vulnerabilities occasionally surfacing... and then she'll make a lesbian joke, because deflecting is fun.The gameplay itself is broken down into distinct turns (seen here as morning/afternoon/evening), in which the player can explore the town freely before deciding on their ""move"" for that particular round. Thankfully, the developers provided enough content to avoid turning the skill-building process into a grind. Dozens of NPCs populate this world, some appearing only at specific times, and each spawning new dialogue on a daily or weekly basis, giving incentive to wander a bit before reading the next magazine or earning more yen.There are some minor bugs, such as character portraits being displayed with an incorrect outfit or NPCs referring to the previous week's guest lecturer as forthcoming. I played the deWesternized version, yet characters would sometimes lapse into their Westernized names, which is momentarily distracting but not nearly gamebreaking.You will most likely need at least a second playthrough in order to experience all six storylines, so the replayability is sufficient to justify the non-sale price, and I encountered new dialogue responses throughout my second run. I'm planning to try a third, attempting to generate the ""best"" ending without the benefit of the New Game+ option, before diving into the sequel... recruiting was just the beginning..."

The stat raising system and the exploration of the city is actually quite charming in its own way, but ultimately only serves to needlessly lengthen the play time of a visual novel that, quite frankly, doesn't have much to read in it. The story builds up, but ends where it feels like it's only getting started.It never really managed to make me laugh; chuckle, at best, I'm afraid. Rather than think of it as a comedy, I'd more describe it as silly, light hearted slice of life... that said, in that regard, I've seen better media. Ultimately, though the writing and characters never especially  moved me or captured my heart (they're a little bit generic, as if hodge podged together from familiar tropes and little else) I think that I'm only left with that impression because the game isn't long enough to give anyone a character arc of satisfying length.Ultimately, it's kind of like playing a single month of Persona 3 or 4, minus the dungeon crawling JRPG side of things, but the fact that the stats never seem to matter for much and the scenes you unlock with characters never allows you to make any dialogue or action choices leaves the player feeling much more like an outsider to the experience. While that's fine for a visual novel, in this case it only contributed to the feeling that this VN was merely half done.All that said, I realize there's a sequel, and, since I did get it in a bundle with the original, I may change my opinion after playing that. Both are fairly cheap, so if I think of them as a bundle it may end up worth it. Nevertheless, CTHCC2 has a lot to make up for, and it's going to have to tremendously exceed the quality of experience the first game gave me if there's any chance I'm going to turn around my opinion on the series."

76561198064650257,Recommended,214610,6362781,"Posted: 2 February, 2013",all,StriderTien,"It's kinda difficult how to describe this game exactly.  It's basically Persona 3 without Tartaris.You go through each day, (morning, noon, and evening) and try to recruit fellow students to join your school club.  To do so, you have to talk to them (like building social links) but in order to make interesting conversation, you must build your rank in various and sundry topics one might converse about (just like leveling personal attributes in Personas 3 and 4).  As you can imagine, this all takes time and the clock is ticking down.  That being said, at it's core, CTHCC is really a time management sim, but you get to experience some nice character development and funny dialoge along the way.  One could make an argument that this game might even fall into the Visual Novel genre in a round about way.A minor gripe with this game is that the translation tries to portray the story as if it were taking place in America even though there is a shrine at the edge of town complete with its resident shrine maiden as well as numerous other aspects of the game that simply smack of Japanese culture.  For those who aren't familiar with the U.S., we don't have shrines... like... AT ALL.   It doesn't have any kind of action/platforming what so ever and is so absurdly riddled with typo's, you begin not even to question if the translator speaks English natively so much but rather, if they are even fluent in it.  Regardless, the writing gets the job done and the characters are all unique and interesting.All things taken into consideration, the ""slice of life"" aura CTHCC brings to the table is a breath of fresh air in a market flooded with violence, zombies, and post apocolyptic environs.  Personally, for eight bux, I'm certainly getting my moneys worth out of this title.  For a nice distraction from the drudgery of the waking world or even other games, I whole heartedly reccomend this off beat title."

You play as a girl named Miley who's a bit of an oddball among her peers. She's a Senior in high school but still enjoys children's shows such as the ""Hero Rangers"". The objective of the game is to recruit at least three other people from your school to join your Comedy club by a certain date. I found each character to be pretty fun to get to know. With a game like this, who needs to go outside or socialize with real people? There are plenty of video game references and pop culture, and lots of funny moments (Your trying to set up a comedy club after all) This game left me with a really good feeling, and I enjoyed every minute of the experience. Oh, and the music is great! As well as the 2D art style. You have the ability to move your character around in certain areas too which was nice, not something you get to do in most of the visual novels I've played.

You can say that it is somewhat of a social simulator. You play as a high school senior named Miley who is determined to start her own school club. She decides to make a comedy themed club. In order to do so, she needs to recruit at least three other studens, or else the school will not allow the club to form. You spend your time roaming around town learning new skills and studying certain topics in order to hold a conversation with potential recruits. Simply put, you have to become good friends in order to get them to join your club, and the best way to do so is to learn about the things that they like and talk to them about it. The game is very short, for me about three hours, but it felt right. The graphics are a blend of SNES and anime, which works perfectly for this game. I wish there were more games like this.Weird note: Looking at the art for this game (buildings and shrines), it's clear that this game takes place in Japan, but in the English version of the game, they say that it is in America. It's nice to see that the developers were kind enough to try to be inclusive with the American audience, but unnecessary. Modern day Japan is not a foreign as it used to be.

This colorful anime style game is an ""adventure lite"" and has more in common with dating sims than even adventure games.  You are a high school girl with a little over a month for your last shot at forming a comedy club.  The goal of the game is to recruit at least 3 people for your club (up to 6) before May gets here, and clubs can no longer officially form at the school.  You accomplish this by talking to people and becoming friendly with them.  Starting a chit chat will give you a glimpse at the topics that they like the most so you can engage them in deeper conversations.  But no one wants to talk to someone who has no knowledge or interest of their beloved topics, so you have to level up your knowledge in the things they are most interested in.  You can do this in a variety of ways such as buying magazines to read before bedtime, catching a show at the cinema, watching tv, hanging out at the art museum, or visiting the school library.  Some of these things cost money to do, and usually the more cash it requires, the more skill you will get.  You get money by collecting bottles on the ground, or doing part time work at a few places around town.  Once you have leveled up your skills you can then work on trying to recruit your ""comedy targets"" so they will sign your paper, join your club and the ending is happy for everyone.  Leveling up with a friend opens up new cutscenes and gives you little insights to their life.It's a lot of text, reading, guesswork and time management.  Engaging in conversation or working passes the time of the day, which brings you closer to the ending, whether you have recruited anyone or not.  That's where the time management comes in.  Do you try to become closer to a friend by talking to them?  Working at the shrine for money so you can catch that cinema show and level up your romance stat?  Occasionally there's homework to juggle too!Cherry Tree High Comedy Club has interesting characters and a bite size play through time... I managed four recruits and completed the game around the three and a half hour mark.  Since it is so linear story driven, I can't see myself playing it again for some time, but others will likely want to dive right back in to try for the six recruits ""perfect"" ending.  If you enjoy dating sims or anime, this game has the tendrils to hook you.  The stories are well written and the translation is at times, quite amusing, being given a very robust translation.  There's controller and big picture support so you can potentially blow through this from the comfort of your couch.  I do wish there had been more variety in the game play, mini games would have broken up the tedium of chatting and time management, and having a wider cast of characters or more inventive ways to get to know them would have been fun.  Instead you are racing for the next conversational topic level... which is entertaining but there was a lot of potential here to be so much more.Definitely worth checking out, even if just for it's cute quirkiness, if any of the above sounds appealing to you!"

There's better out there.I didn't get to enjoy this game.The story is OK and it develops well throughout the story (I only got until the end of April).I believe that the main thing that threw me off was the lack of ""feel"" from a japanese VN that felt more like adapted than translated. If I want American or British feel, I'd go after an American or British VN, if I want a Japanese feel, I go after a Japanese VN. This one... (in the non-westernized version) Is around 3/4 translated & 1/4 adapted.Good:The gameplay quickly gets too repetitive and mechanical if you want to get to the good end, specially if you do the homework right off the bat.The story-tellers tried to make this non-repetitive and that's good and it worked well enough.Bad:I expected this to be heavy on comedy but... It wasn't. The comedy was OK sometimes, weak but, unfortunately, only allowed me to smile at best... when it didn't feel awkward due to wooseysm applied.Even when playing the non-westernized version, I saw what is to me too much wooseysm including jokes that I don't see how they can make sense in Japanese. Heck, one or other doesn't even make sense in its context.I don't know wether to recommend or not this game.

I'm not saying this is a bad game, but it just shouldn't garner a price any higher.Now, for the actual game.If you enjoy simple visual novel-styled games that involve the central mechanic of developing relationships with people based on levels of numerical values, then you will enjoy this. The story is light-hearted, and fairly charming; but there's is very little story to the actual main character herself. In order to get the best ending, you will also need to play through this at least two times, and maybe four times at the most. This is by no means anything on the level of 'Katawa Shoujo', or 'Fate/Stay Night', but is not difficult to enjoy either. The simplicity is really what makes this game fun enough to run through it several times.You can clear it very quickly, and another playthrough means just getting the rest of the people to join you; and that's where I draw the line with buying it for no more than $2.99: because it's such a short game with little to add during your run of New Game+. It's still good though, and easy to play if you're out somewhere, or waiting for your next class to begin.*EDIT*Also, why do they keep pushing the fact that this game clearly takes place in the United States, when I can clearly see how hard they're trying to cover up that this town looks like it's straight out of Japan?

The difference here is that you're making purely platonic friends with the end goal being to recruit people to join your comedy club. Otherwise, it's the stuff you're probably already familiar with- the ultimate test in time management of socializing, keeping up with school, working part-time, and leveling up your stats.It's a great game and very relaxing (if simultaneously suspensful because you wonder if you can get everyone before the month is out) with cute character design, dialogue, and development. It's just a really well-rounded package and if you've got any interest in visual novels, enjoyed Persona's social aspect, or just want a cute little story then this shouldn't be missed.It should be noted there is a Westernized version and a localized version- the former changes the original Japanese names to American ones like 'Miley' or 'Sara'. I played with the latter option because it's kind of jarring to play a clearly Japanese product but have it stripped of that sort of authenticity- and I'm not necessarily stuck up on things like subs vs dubs. I can't comment on the quality of the westernized version, but it's great that it's an option for people who want it, but it should be noted that the sequel stays faithful to the original Japanese qualities... so if you're interested in both the localized version is probably your best pick."

I however can't fault it for that, and what it does offer in my opinion is some quality gameplay for that genre combined with great dialogue and a decent size city to explore. My grievances are the limited and random statements made by characters, often causing them to repeat the same thing throughout intervals and the somewhat grindy nature of some conversations, provided no in game events are occuring (needed more in my opinion in this regard to detract from the basic gameplay). All in all it is a game of good value if you like the genre, that does even despite these listed flaws keep itself interesting through humor and the odd friendship/life lesson."

Each skill then helps you makes friends interested in the same thing. For example, Cindy likes Music, so the higher my level in Music, the easier it is to increase my ""level"" as a friend with her.

One issue I take with it is; if you're going to make a ""game"" that consists of reading lines over the back drop of pictures, you can at least make it 1080p HD. It isn't even 720p. In this day and age that is shameful. I could move past this though if it were the only problem. The real problem this 'game' has is very simple and yet very major -- It lacks controls! I've 'played' other so called 'visual novels' before and no matter who made them they all used pretty much the same system of control, which makes sense since it works. That system isn't here. I couldn't use my mouse or game pad at the main menu. I had to use the arrow keys and enter. After that the only thing the 'game' allowed me to do was click the left mouse button to skip to the next line of text. I'm not kidding - That was literally it. I couldn't scroll back to previous text or anything. If it's a good story and funny I'll never really know, because I am not going to spend my time on something with such bad design or rather lack of design.

Evenly position 2 racks in the middle of the oven and preheat to 375 degrees F. (on convection setting if you have it.) Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone sheets. (If you only have 1 baking sheet, let it cool completely between batches.)2. Put the butter in a microwave safe bowl, cover and microwave on medium power until melted. (Alternatively melt in a small saucepan.) Cool slightly. Whisk the sugars, eggs, butter and vanilla in a large bowl until smooth.3. Whisk the flour, baking soda and salt in another bowl. Stir the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients with a wooden spoon; take care not to over mix. Stir in the chocolate chips or chunks.4. Scoop heaping tablespoons of the dough onto the prepared pans. Wet hands slightly and roll the dough into balls. Space the cookies about 2-inches apart on the pans. Bake, until golden, but still soft in the center, 12 to 16 minutes, depending on how chewy or crunchy you like your cookies. Transfer hot cookies with a spatula to a rack to cool. Serve.5. Store cookies in a tightly sealed container for up to 5 days.For a Rocky Road Bar:1. Lightly butter a 9 by 13-inch baking pan. Make the batter as per cookie recipe and fold in 1 cup chopped walnuts along with the chocolate chips. Spread batter in prepared pan. Bake until the edges are light brown and the batter sets, about 45 minutes. Cool slightly and cover surface with 4 cups marshmallows and 1 cup chocolate chips. Broil at least 8 inches from the heat until marshmallows turn golden brown, about 2 minutes. (Keep an eye on the marshmallows, and turn the pan frequently--they go from golden to char in a wink.)

I'm a quick learner but i also quickly learned that on this game picking the right dialogue option wasn't good enough. Oh no not for CTHCC. You have to have pick the right dialogue option and completing the minigames. I don't care if you're pick the best route.I finished all the minigames in a night and then go to bed then game over!! This is worse than katawa shoujo and go go nippon put together i kid you not.

There's quite a bit of stat building and you have a limited number of moves each day, so you have to plan from the get go. It's helpful to use a character guide to tell you what each character likes or dislikes to speed things along because choosing the wrong topic to chat with them about will lower your closeness level with them and set you back.

Since you count as a member, and your best friend is for sure the second member, you only need to max social links with three different people of your choice throughout the game, by April 30th (application deadlines. ) Just like in Persona 4, anytime you rank up in social link with someone, you get to see a cool cutscene where they have conversations and do cool things. Unlike Persona, this social linking system is more deep. There are roughly 10 or so topics, and you can gain knowledge in them, by reading books, watching tv/movies, going to exhibits/ participating in other events. Something kind of similar to Persona is that you can purchase books or magazines and read them at night. This game also has a Morning / Afternoon / Night system, again similar to Persona, where certain things will change it to the next time of day. I beat the game in 3.6 hours, and I only recruited 3 of the possible 6 recruits. AGAIN, like Persona, there is a new game + which brings over stuff from your previous game, in this case your knowledge in all the 10 topics. (Persona does this too with Courage , etc. ) This makes it easier to talk/recruit some certain people, depending on what topics you boosted up the most. There are three endings to the game I believe, one of which is the bad ending (which does not allow new game plus) and that's if you don't get five members by the end of the game. (Again, you start with 2, so you only really need 3 more) The regular ending (the one I got) was quite nice, and is if you manage to succesfully make the club by the end of the game. The good ending is if you recruit all 6 possible recruits, (making it an 8 member club, counting you and your best friend. ) And I'm not sure what this ending is like. What was cool is that at the end of the game, The main character takes a picture with all the members of the club. It would be cool to see all the other art for all the other club combinations. All of the art in this game is very anime - esque, so if you are turned off by that, I guess don't go for this? But I still think you will be missing out. You can now play the game in a westernized version or a version where everyone has the original names and what not (which is the version I played in and reccomend). The music is this game, although not plentyful is great in my opinion. It's all very catchy and upbeat. (Aside from a few tracks used in sad scenes of course. ) Since this game is a lot about friendship and how great that is, it does remind me of Persona 4's mood. There are items in this game, that you can buy and use, which do numerous things. Take note again that the social linking system is very similar to persona wherein certain times you just have a nice chat instead of coming closer to ranking up, or ranking up. The characters in this game are kind of tropey, but have some deepness to them. Of course you should not expect something like this to be too deep, but I think it has some interesting characters, and there was not a single one I disliked.   Regardless, I think this game is worth the roughly 4 hours it took me to beat. As well as the potential 8 hours, if I do it over again but with new game plus. (If I do, I plan on going for the three I did not get this time around. (Maybe even after that I'll go for the good ending with all 8). Overall, I would reccomend this to anyone who's cool with Visual Novels, or Persona 4's social linking system, or both."

With the word ""comedy"" right in the title, the game is under pressure to deliver, and some might find the humor a little too bright and quirky, but it generally delivers. The gameplay can get a tiny bit grindy towards the end, but it's not really long enough to suffer much for it. I managed to just recruit the minimum of 3 characters two game-days before the deadline in my first playthrough, which clocked in at about 5.5 hours. A second play-through (which allows you to carry over your skills and records of the potential recruits preferences) took just another 3 hours and was wrapped up with an in-game week to spare.Brevity aside, this game did successfully elicit both laughs and a few tears from me for the correct reasons. Actually, the short length could make this a good choice for someone who is hesitant to try something from the visual-novel genre/medium.Also, I think the only difference between the original and westernized localization translation are the character names."

I suppose you could call it a visual novel game, but it has some small RPG elements to it. This type of game caters to niche audience so if you don't like story-based games, time/social management, or anime influnce aspects in a game then you may not like this.Personally, I really love this game. All the characters and their backstories are really interesting. The writting and general humor of the game is spot on for me. Also the music is incredibly catchy. It really does remind me of playing Persona 3/4, without all the JRPG elements. If this game looks even remotely interesting to you, I say check it out, you may be surprised and find a pleaseant experience awaiting you."

The cute music was really short and looped and I exhausted myself through some parts of game hoping something interesting will happen (or I'll be able to save).There's no humor. Damn. I'm a weirdo that likes anime humor, from light-hearted slice-of-life, through slapstic, to the really surrealistic and abstract one. But here, I didn't smile even once. Maybe it was the translation. I get puns weren't translatable, but if the game was just puns (and, frankly, puns are NEVER translatable in a way allowing them to stay funny), maybe they should choose a different one to translate and put on Steam? Meme and games references felt like bad fan translations, when they tried to be cool.And now, I didn't finish the game right and it hurts my obsessive side, but just thinking about replaying it makes my skin crawl. Maybe if I'll be trapped in a fallout shelter and would want to remind myself of times where I thought playing this game was a bad thing."

76561198093268930,Recommended,214610,29296086,Posted: 16 January,all,Comedy Queen of Cherry Tree Town,"So, a little while ago, I finished doing a second playthrough of the entire game (first one was two-three years ago), and before doing so, I was slightly worried that the fond memories I had with this game wouldn't live up to what I expected it to be, nor would I laugh as much as before (viewing the jokes a second time didn't help it's chances). Well, not only was the game just a charming and rewarding as I remembered it to be, I... Honestly think I laughed harder and more frequently here then I did back in 2014.The game itself is about a 3rd year senior called 'Mairu' (Miley for the westernized English edition, who likes eating chilli dogs and going fast occasionally), who wants to start a comedy club to create the second successful female comedy duo to emerge from her school, Cherry Tree High, and the game is you picking up recruits by getting to know them and building up your conversations stats (so you appear more interesting and recruit people faster). Basically, a visual novel with movement and dating sim mechanics.Gameplay wise, it's not much, so to make up for it, the game puts all it's focus on it's presentation and narrative. The story, while inheriently simple, understands how to build around it's prescence to create a likeable world with likeable and well-rounded characters. The main cast ranges from reclusive to colourful, allowing for diverse personalities to work of of each other to create some pretty funny dialogue, Mairu in particular helping others through their problems with a mix of genuine sympathy and her motto of bringing smiles to everyone she knows. Their are moments where you question their methods of achieving their goals (especially one guy in particular), yet it doesn't take away your enjoyment of them, or their likeability.The game handles it's mood rather effectively, transitioning from despondent to full of joy and lighted rather seamlessly at times, and when it has to hold on an emotion for an entire scene, it'll do it simply yet potently. But honestly, that's probably mostly due to the ost that plays during these moments.Oh yeah, the soundtrack's pretty fricken great too. It's a short selection (only 8 songs), but the production work on them is so stellar that it makes up for that sad fact nicely, and the only leitmotif used has only one significance ingame whilist making up the intro and credit theme the other two times (distinctly mixed as well), which makes me happy beyond any reasonable measure. The ost can be anything it wants to be: Laidback and relaxing, cheerful and upbeat, depressingly emotion, you name it, and they're so well made that despite the numerous amount of times I hear them ingame, I never get sick of them. It's a shame I can't give more money to these people to purchase a copy of the soundtrack, but it's nice to know the developer included them for free in the game's steam folder, so props to him for that.Art style's got a liquidy, oil painting look to it in terms of background, which make for some very nice scenery, and the character designs got that nice little anime asthetic to them that seem to drives all the westerners wild (me included, to an extent), having sharper outlines that allow for a nice contrast with their surroundings. The designs themselves seem to match the personality traits of who they represent as well. It's a little hard to describe exactly how, but when you see a character, what you'd think they'd be like based on their look would most likely be right.Also, maybe it's just my particular sense of humour, but Mairu is probably the funniest video game character I've ever had the pleasure of watching spout one liners to everyone in her path. I suppose seeing how the game is called Cherry Tree High 'Comedy' Club, the humour really had to be on point, and about 85-90% of the time it is, it is, and that's including the whole cast! So it's good to know the game lives up to it's namesake.Clearly, this review has gone on long enough, and I'm running outta things to talk about, so I'll end on this:Admittedly, this game is the first visual novel-esque game I've ever played, and if I ever bothered to play another (excluding the sequel, which I did play), I'd consider it a great introduction to the genre. It has heart, comedy and a nice sense of everyday life atmosphere. I'm looking forward to booting it up again in another two years to get the same reaction I did the first two times, and I highly recommend at least playing the demo.Also, there's pop-culture references and memes that can be witnessed at times, so hopefully whoever's playing this in the future understands what's being referenced and won't consider (I'm pretty sure) one joke a dead meme. Actually, their was an original version of the meme joke in the Japanese version that wouldn't be understood by us 'uncultured' westerners, so they switched it to a different one. I'd guess you could consider it more a reference, but in my eyes, anything quotable and referencable is a meme in itself. If you're interested in learner either what scene in the game I'm referring to or what the original joke was, here's a link to the translation faq on the official website:http://cherrytreehigh.com/translation"
