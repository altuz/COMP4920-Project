You unlocked many weopons each time you ranked up, and had many weopon upgrades and costomizable features. Many weopons were only used in certain maps, for example, a l968 sniper rifle (I think thats the name) wasnt used on Nuketown because it would get owned by famas and galils all the time. This game needs some serios addons however, as it became boring at higher ranks. I think the upgrades that should be added are:1.voice comunication2.Larger maps3.more weopons & equipment4.rides such as tanks-jeeps-bikes5.more camos (the only good one is tiger)I hope you guys enjoyed this quick review on Black ops - mac edition.GOLDIE OUT!"

The multiplayer is fantastic in its customization and maps as well as the zombies mode which is legendary. With all of this said, I still cannot reccomend this game to anyone. Unless you just want to play multiplayer, then DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. The campaign is so glitchy and most times if you die even once the game freezes and you have to force quit and restart from the beggining, it is so ♥♥♥♥ing annoying. The servers for zombie mode are ♥♥♥♥ing dead as♥♥♥♥♥♥so you really can only play solo because there still is no private lobbies (WTF?!?). Even the multiplayer servers are pretty much dead with there only being like 2 or 3 servers active and the hosts are constantly changing the rules for playing getting you kicked out for no ♥♥♥♥ing reason.

76561198063275767,Not Recommended,214630,11317252,"Posted: 19 July, 2014",all,YeeHaw,"So I was watching some high-round Zombie games on youtube, Xbox/PS3 tend to bug and freeze/restart in th later rounds, experiencing problems such as a huge framerate issue, laggy or missing textures, G-spawns, the game restarting after you had used up the small amount of memory etc. etc.                                                                                                                                      Since I have Bootcamp installed on this Mac, I decided to buy it for mac instead of PC because of the steep price difference. (£30.00 for a 3 year game?!?!?) Which was a terrible mistake.                                                                                                             The first thing that comes to mind is that there is no steam support, the game opens in a seperate window. This leads to Friend notifications being oddly placed in the corner of the screen. This can lead to the covering of vital information such as the minimap, ammo -_-. It also means I can't chat to my friends in game. In order to speak with them, I have to exit the damn game. Why? Is it that hard just to reskin the PC version of the game? That was what I was expecting and hoping for. But I digress. The Second thing that you will probably be checking is the Options menu. The first thing that pops out is that there is NO FOV SLIDER. I must have spent 10 minutes looking for it, and when I finally decided that it wasn't there, I was really annoyed. I don't see why companies don't think that having changeable FOV is not a big deal. For me it was Irritating to my eyes, and I had to take short breaks at intervals. Also, the graphics. The texture quality ONLY GOES UP TO 1200 BY 800. EVEN TEAM FORTRESS 2 HAS 2000 BY SOMETHING AND THAT GAME IS SEVEN. YEARS. OLD.                                                       Great game by the way.                                                                                                                                                               So after that, I decided to play Zombies. My internet was down at the time, and what happened next was probably the single most annoying thing in the game. I COULD NOT PLAY SOLO OFFLINE. WHY?!? What is the point of having a Solo mode if I can't play while I've taken it out? I thought that was the point of a laptop; you can take it with you when you need it.                    I tried to load up Shangri-La, one of my favourite maps because of it's challenging, yet rewarding nature. But It failed to load THREE TIMES, the game crashing on every one of them!                                                                                                                             I won't touch on how there are approximately ZERO people to play with, since I am a solo player and I don't play with randoms, as I have had several bad experiences with less experienced players. But since Aspyr was too lazy, they did not put in cross-platform support in. They really shot themselves in the foot here, as 90% of the servers that THEY HAVE BOUGHT ARE NOT BEING USED. I only found one server with players on it, and it wasn't even full. Perhaps 3 on weekdays.                         In short, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. You'll be better off, with a reasonable sized community still playing the game just buying a cheap console and a second hand Black Ops for it. Avoid this like the plague."

Instead of matchmaking, it had servers, which i absolutely hate and out of the 400 lobbys, there was only one, nuketown 24/7. absolute garbage. i recommend getting a PC or bootcamp and play the other one. DO NOT BUY"

The campain is amazing!, The multiplayer is O.K. and the zombies are fun, and you get 3 zombie maps to play without DLC. If you have console, I would recommend just getting bo2 for it, but this game is still great. PS. Dont try to join servers on multiplayer, they are always full. Let the game just auto find a game for you and there will be tons of players. I would recommend this game."
