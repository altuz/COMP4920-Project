,Not Recommended,214700,8168647,"Posted: 21 December, 2013",all,MurrayL,"Thirty Flights of Loving is an indie art game which I found short, obtuse and largely uninteresting.Speaking as someone who loved Dear Esther, and even Thirty Flights' developer's previous game ('Gravity Bone', which is included here as a free extra), I found myself thoroughly bewildered by Thirty Flights of Loving.I was bewildered by the sloppy non-linear storytelling. The game hops, skips, and leaps, with all the grace of a big rig in a tutu. I've played through the whole game and read several summaries to make sure I wasn't missing anything, but even once I made sense of the story being told (a by-the-books tale of a criminal caper gone wrong), it didn't connect with me at all.I was bewildered by the lack of flow within the gameplay. For such a short game, I was astonished to find myself stuck on at least two occasions. Normally I'd be the last person to call for such handholding tactics as blatant signposting or railroading of the player, but in this case the current state is completely at odds with the intended purpose. The developer obviously wants to tell a story, but I found it a trial just to get to the next part. This is not to mention the pointless interactions in the game which sometimes seem to serve no purpose whatsoever.I was bewildered by the end. It came out of nowhere, and left me with the strongest feeling of 'is that it?' I think I've ever encountered with a game. I spent more time in the options menu than I did with the game itself. I wouldn't mind if it was some kind of masterpiece of storytelling, but it just wasn't.Most of all, I was and am bewildered by the praise this game has garnered. 88% (at the time of writing) on Metacritic. Critical acclaim. Fans on the forums defending it to the hilt. I saw similar reactions to Dear Esther (which, as I said earlier, I felt deserved every bit of its praise), but I genuinely cannot understand it in this case.Maybe I'm missing something huge here, but Thirty Flights of Loving was not an enjoyable, enlightening, or otherwise entertaining experience for me. I respect any developer who attempts to tell stories through games, but this feels like one of the more unfinished, unfocused efforts that I have played. Not recommended."

Although the art direction is certainly unique, it's meant to be more of a fast-paced walking simulator than anything else. Supposedly there is something meta or symbolic about the game and its method of storytelling, but I'll be damned if I can figure out what it is. And the story is so intentionally vague that it's difficult to get anything out of it.I really did try to get something out of it. I love games that try to do something different and try to approach story-telling from different perspectives. Games like ""Dear Esther"", ""Journey"", ""Going Home"" and so forth were some of the most amazing experiences I've played because of their unique way of getting the story across. But I got nothing out of this game. Nothing."

And I think that's what this game was: an experiment in using the schizophrenic yet calculated timeline and editing of a Tarantino film (for example) and making it work within a video game boundary. It sounds pretentious, but at the end of the day, it's an interesting look at how we can tell stories in video games and that's most definitely a positive (and sorely needed) effort in our medium."

It's like you watch the most important pieces of a movie shuffled around. The game has some activity where you have to walk and solve some easy puzzles (?) to advance, but other than that it is just enjoying the scenery, trying to understand and connect the story.The game was build in a modified Doom engine using a typical style which totally fits the game mechanics. Audio and soundtrack are great and fit the game perfectly.You can speed run this game in 5 minutes I think, but normally when you relax and enjoy the game it should take about 30 minutes. Because the story is so jumpy, it invites you to play it again just to look at the parts again.In the end the game reminds you that a game doesn't have to be long to be good and that a story can also be told by leaving out all the unnecessary parts."

I in-depth played it (Stopping to read all the cards, payed extra attention to the environments, and tried to explore best I could, etc.) AND played through a second time on commentary mode, only to find myself clocked in at a little less than an hour.

,Not Recommended,214700,9162321,"Posted: 17 February, 2014",all,icedwarrior,"Thirty Flights of Loving:3/10Perhaps it was because I had gone into the game with high expectations (friends saying it was great, Extra Credits recommending it, and it having an overall 88/100 Metacritic score), but I expected a great game. A good game. At least a decent game… when I beat the game, I had a sour taste in my mouth, exclaiming “what the ♥♥♥♥? That’s it?!? …”. It’s difficult to say that I feel “burned” in my purchase due to the fact that I paid about $1.50 and the fact that I didn’t do any research other than “other people generally like it” (something I would chastise someone else doing)…but I feel incredibly disappointed in the game.The first thing that I simply must state is the fact that it is short. I was “warned” of this beforehand, and I was cool with it. I’m fine with short games, so long as they “last” a bit (my view is one hour, thirty minutes and on is acceptable in most circumstances)…but this game lasted exactly 12 minutes. Yeah…12 minutes, from when I started it, to when I was done with the entire game. The ♥♥♥♥? I confused about the plot and game in general (I’ll discuss that shortly), so immediately after the game was over, I decided I was going to play it again to see what I was missing. Surely I missed something in regards to the plot or something. Thankfully, I thought, there’s a developer commentary, and so I selected that. Now, normally, this does a lot for me; as someone who’s obtained a degree in the field I find these things fascinating… but I was immensely disappointed in the commentary. Most of it was describing things that frankly wasn’t interesting (“Normally, ninety-degree angled hallways aren’t great, but after adding a bevel…”, “…I don’t approve of littering.”, etc.) and even after stopping to listen to the commentary, not only did it not shed any more light on the plot, but it lasted 15 minutes (with me taking my time and exploring, too). That adds up to 27 minutes. For beating the game twice. That’s not acceptable.I was interested in reading some of the critic’s comments on why they enjoyed the game, and a reoccurring theme was that they enjoyed the ambiguous nature of the story, and the frequent use jump-cuts. I didn’t. Let me explain what happens in the story (spoilers, obviously): you start in a hallway, letting you learn the controls of the game (WASD for movement, mouse for camera, tough stuff). You then enter a bar, unable to interact with any of the characters, who oddly stare into your soul. All you can do is consume alcohol (which does nothing, I add, other than disappearing and making a sound), and interact with a fake painting (which is among numerous paintings), opening up a secret passage, leading to the introduction of two characters (which is, admittedly, my favorite part of the game, although that’s not saying much). After this, you board a plane, and, after you leave, you’re immediately thrown into an unknown situation: your romantic interest is pointing a gun at you, in a strange location, and bloody. This is just a short summary of what you’ll encounter. And, sadly, this is about a third of the game. There’s so many random cuts to different parts of the story that you never really learn enough about the characters to care about them (and, I’m not sure if I’ve emphasized this already, but the game is short). Perhaps, in a strange way, peeling oranges with your loved one might be an intimate moment between two characters and the player, but when you’ve known the character for about two minutes, it didn’t mean anything to me. Also, I simply have to pose the question: why the hell were there three rooms dedicated to “Bernolli’s Principle” (something to do about high and low air pressure)?So…yeah…I tried to be objective about this game and find redeeming qualities, but I just don’t see any. I mean, it’s a functional game, I guess…?TL;DR:[/b]Literally twelve minutes long, extremely brief and ambiguous plot, commentary about 90 degree hallways. Don’t waste your time with this game, no matter the price. Had I known what I know now, I wouldn’t have played the game even if it was free."

Its linear storytelling is what made it absolutely beautiful. I won't really call it a game because of its longetivity, I finished the main story for approximately 10 minutes. Just imagine you bought a not-so-cheap cheeseburger and it took 10 minutes for you to eat the whole thing.( I picked up this is for $1.24 when it was on sale so if your interested on playing it, I highly recommend waiting for a sale since I think $4.99 for a 10 minutes gameplay is absurd )"

I took about 20 minutes, and I did it all again to make sure I wasn't missing something. Seriously, when it ended, I simply couldn't believe it. It's shorter than most flash games.However, even if you ingore its ridiculous length, you still have the fact that it's barely interactive enough to even be called a 'game' in the first place. You just run from one area to another and things happen around you, to an extent, but nothing much happens to you. In short, you are not even involved in this tiny title's escapades. merely a biwildered bystander.Luckily, I got this in some bundle or other so it didn't cost me very much.

This does not mean, however, that because this game was simple, used an old engine, did not have any elements of gameplay, voice acting, or interactivity; that it was any good. It is not a ""game"" there is nothing different you would experience from that of watching a video of a playthrough of it, so at best it could be considered a short viewer-driven films. Even then, the ""story"" depicted was bland, generic, cliche', any of the words you can think of to infer that it added nothing new to discuss beyond its almost complete lack of content and quality.Normally this wouldn't be an issue, bad games are common, but when the ""professional"" reviews gush over how amazing it is; 9.5/10 and whatnot, you can't help but wonder if perhaps they are trying too hard to make ""art"" out of a joke."

The game consists of about 10 different rooms, each taking about a minute to get through and suddenly out of nowhere you're hit with a The End sign and a bunch of walkthrough credits with comments about the great decisions they made and how they decided on them. These great decisions are along the lines of weird random jump cuts  that change the entire scenario for no reason. There's also a room with displays of a bunch the game models and animated GIF video timelapses of screenshots of their creation. How impressive is that?Also, there's a scene at a wedding where the characters randomly start rising up towards the ceiling. The developer notes say this was a bug, that they left in because it was so much better. Um, excuse me. This just proves how little effort they put into the game. Find a bug? Fix it? Nah. Let's just say it makes the game better. The game is practically on rails. I played it twice and nothing I did changed anything in the game beyond the room I was in.I recommend buying it if you want to see possibly the worst game ever. It cost £4 and for some reason has a very high metascore of 88. I have also heard real game reviewers saying it's a brilliant game. I'm not really sure what's going there, but it's clearly something shifty that needs to be looked at. I know I will only be relying on user reviews in future."

So I guess what I will say is that this is... sort of like a Quentin Tarantino film that's been super-condensed to a length of just 15 minutes and turned into an art experiment. There's no ""gameplay"" to speak of - it's a first person interactive story-slash-art-piece, nothing more. The graphics are as simple as can be, but it has some cool ideas and is worth checking out if you are open to these sorts of artsy game experiments. I wasn't kidding before, though - the experience is over in literally 15 minutes or so. So just keep that in mind as far as your personal ""price vs. playtime"" factor goes.One other note: this game also includes its prequel, ""Gravity Bone"", for free. I recommend playing this first.

I found the characters to be somewhat memorable, if only in role rather than name. The story is interesting once it's broken down for you or played through multiple times. It's the Momento style of story-telling, not just a random series of events that some are making it out to be. There is a fleshed out tale here that is admittedly poignant, and in a very interesting setting.CONS:My overall time played was accrued through more than one playthrough. It is VERY short. For having such an interesting story, it's poorly told. The artsy factor actually detracts from the experience in this aspect. It would have been much better if the story to have been expanded upon, but I feel that's not what they were going for, for the sake of brevity. Unfortunately, a lack of any consequence makes it little more than a walking simulator that blows right by over the course of ten minutes or so.WORTH:It's very short and can be beaten quickly. If you're not the type to enjoy walking sims, you'll probably find you've dropped cash on something condescending and vapid.OVERALL:This game is not worth five USD, simple as that. Is it a travesty upon gaming? A sin that cannot be redeemed? Is it the worst thing that has ever stolen the money of players everywhere?

As the player, I did not have any real sense of agency as the game hurried me through series of strange, loosely connected events toward the all too fast approaching end.  At least in the prequel, Gravity Bone, there was some exposition and I had items I was able to use to interact with the environment.  It was sparse, but there were game mechanics there.  This is less of a game to be played, and more of a very short expressionist film to be watched.  If you come expecting an interactive story, you will be disappointed.  Thirty Flights of Loving is more akin to the experience of visiting a particularly short house of illusions at a carnival.

Plus the games wacky art style and music are more than worth the price of admission. I'm honestly a huge fan of this game.On a side it comes with the prequel ""Gravity Bone"" which is also awesome and features the same type of style, so there's two reasons to buy it. However you can download ""Gravity Bone"" from the net for free and ""test run"" how you feel about this type of game if you're nervous about spending the 5 euro. But honestly I'd recommend buying this."

Regardless of whatever headaches I have, may you enjoy the fruits of our labor.We may never know who Citizen Abel truly is, but we do have stories about him."" -- Brendon Chung,Thirty Flights of LovingI'm not going to lie: This is a difficult game. It will anger you. It is meant to do so.But if you pretend it doesn't have a story that is desperately trying to make its way to you, you are deluding yourself. And you are falling for the trap that Chung has so meticulously designed for the average player.I don't mean that this is a difficult game insofar that it's hard to complete. It's level design is agonizingly linear, and excruciatingly short in length. It's difficult because the most important events in the story don't happen on the screen. It's difficult like a jigsaw puzzle without a picture on the box -- difficult because you don't know what you're putting together, let alone how.It's short because most of what it's trying to tell you, it tries to communicate by not telling you at all. Just leaving hints, out of order, tucked away in parts that don't seem important. That is not to say that Chung is lazy and expects you to make the story for him, simply that he respects the player enough to understand what's on the table and what that means is likely being dealt under it.This isn't really much of a game in the usual sense of a game. It is a linear short-story, told in a fragmented non-linear fashion. It is so short a story, in fact, that it is really closer to a poem in that vein: its decided brevity poses more questions than it answers, and that is its main storytelling technique -- in typical crime-mystery fashion.That is what I love about Thirty Flights of Loving, and what so many people hate: it gives you but a blink of an eye, from a view of limited scope, in a world promised to be much larger than it shows. A world that Chung has obviously given much thought, more thought than a passer-by might think he has given the game itself. And like a poem, agonizingly short, its parts are so few that they have been chosen with such care that they tell more than the pieces themselves ever could. Like in poetry, how sometimes the story resides as much in the silence between the words as the words themselves.Thirty Flights of Loving isn't really so much a game, as it is a question. A series of questions, posed to the player, answers known by the characters, if they could only speak. And it sparks a rare kind of intense and frustrated curiosity that I have experienced but few times in my entire life.It does so by being more than what it is: it is incredibly consciously constructed, made for consumption from the very beginning. And if you try to wolf it down and casually digest it like you would a hamburger and fries, it will tear through your gut like a box of nails. It is uncompromising, and it will make you angry.It is difficult like that, it was made to be. That is what makes it so uniquely wonderful to me. Chung dares to♥♥♥♥♥♥you off, and asks you what you're going to do about it.That part is up to you.Thatis the game."

Maybe it's a fault of the hype around it, claiming that there's more to that game than there really is.The game does features some original ideas. The story is told achronologically, conveyed only through pictures and to put all the pieces together you will have to play through it couple times to notice things after seeing whole picture. If only story would be more absorbing and had less holes in it (it's derp, it's open ended!!!). Why would you play narrative game if not for the bloody story? In result there's not much incentive to put all the pieces together (you're not going to connect all the dots anyway, so why bother).The graphics is OK (for a Quake 2 modded engine that is) and the music is quite nice. What's most annoying is that it's a barely a game, your actions don't matter at all. Leave guns and ammo? Nobody cares. Take different direction, game teleports you! That's just lazy level design (or lack of it). Goes without saying that you have no effect on the ending. It does say something about the game if ""credit hall"" is the biggest level in game.In the end it's neither good game nor good story. I don't think it will make much difference in story-telling department as well. I'm glad not much developers charge for proof of concept projects. It's of course important to experiment and explore what games can be and become, but it shouldn't be an excuse.

To me a type of media becomes an art form when there is a piece of that media that has its head up it's own♥♥♥♥♥ and is filled with the pretentious ""you just don't get"" attitude. After playing Thirty Flights of Loving... I have now come to the conclusion that video games are an art form.This game cannot physically last you longer than an hour. In 54 minutes I have accomplished to beat the game twice, beat the free game that has been included as an extra, tinker a bit in the options, and completed the game once more with developer commentary (and I listened to all of them). Now a short game in itself isn't a bad thing, but if you aren't going to deliver on length you have to deliver in memorability and quality, and Thirty Flights doesn't deliver in either.""But the story isn't linear"" cries the proffessional critic. Wow, what an amazing feature to have. Movies have been doing this for decades, and when someone sloppily puts together an uniteresting ""outlaws fighting the establishment"" plot that has been bathed in Tarantino-influence (you know, without all of that pesky charm or character that Tarantino is great at implementing), but with the twist that it is a video game, I don't really feel like celebrating. I feel angry.You know what other game had an unlinear story? Beyond: Two Souls. I am not saying that game is masterpiece (far from it), but it had more going for it than this. Beyond: Two Souls biggest fault in my opinion was to be too ambitious story-wise and not ambitious enough gameplay-wise. It tried to tackle more story than it could handle, and then cut off the gameplay to deal with it. Thirty Flights is like that, with the exception that it isn't amitious story-wise either. It is a very basic and bareboned plot, and no amount of jumping to and fro in time and place will conceal that. It's super simple. You don't even need a second playthrough to get the plot. Sure there might be small details, but that's it.This game is an experiment and I can understand that. The problem here is that someone apparently thought that this overly artsy, simple story with no real gameplay and a bland atmosphere was apparently worth money, and five bucks at that. There are games on Steam for half of that price that will give you more and be more memorable in the end.What makes this really annoying to me is that I don't hate walking simulators. I don't hate art games. I don't hate sacrificing gameplay to tell a good story or trying to innovate. You just need to realize what your work is worth. And by putting meaningless slop like this on the forefront as great art is doing that media a disservice. It's pioneering and innovate, but it's not well made.

Blendo Games goes with what they have and don't let the lack of high-end art stop them; they make it work with beautiful execution.There is very little to no dialogue, but the story is pulled off really well. It uses that design limitation to its benefit with creative solutions consisting of disjointed gameplay events and visual cues. Blendo Games is a professional miniaturist at arranging an emotional narrative with a very tight design scope resulting in something spectacular that could rival some of the traditional storytelling used by AAA game studios.I’d recommend playing “Gravity Bone” if you can to get a taste of what both games have to offer; it takes about 15 minutes and is free at the developer’s website:http://blendogames.com/"

I knew this prior to purchasing this title (which was on sale at the time), but I was intrigued when I heard how innovative it was with its narrative presentation. However, I discovered that the ""innovation"" was simply a non-linear story offering virtually no exposition. And here comes the counter argument: ""Oh-no! The developer didn't hand you an explanation on a silver platter because you were too lazy and stupid to actually explore what the story had to offer!"" Nope. I did a second playthrough with developer commentary enabled, played the prequel Gravity Bone, and was still none the wiser.Now I'm not saying that these types of narratives can't work, but here's the problem with a lot of these stories: when very little exposition is given about the characters and how they relate to the world around them, this strips away any humanity the characters would have had, which in turn makes it difficult for the audience to have any profound connection with them.

So I occasionally try out games like this, in hopes that I will find something moving, inspiring, and interesting - not always expecting something fun. I'm willing to forgo the fun if the experience is enough by itself.So when Thirty Flights of Loving went on sale, I checked review sites to see what they said. Right away I noticed a strong discord between the scores of professional reviewers and the scores given by the players. Simply put, reviewers seemed to love it, and players seemed to hate it. I decided to try it out anyway, in case my sense of art might give me some insight which the lower-scoring players lacked.Unfortunately for Thirty Flights, after playing through the game, I have to side with the players on this one. This game isn't fun, and really just isn't that interesting.The story is one you've seen many times in movies and on TV, but this time it's told via a cast of vaguely humanoid boxes. Reviewers called this game ""lovingly crafted"", but after the opening scene, it all felt incomplete to me. More like a sketch before the eventual painting.At the end, which comes very quickly, you'll wonder what you just did for the last half hour. And then, like me, you'll probably wonder why you didn't do somethign else instead. You might even get mad that you spent money for this.Don't get me wrong here - I don't like insulting the work of people who are clearly forging ahead into new, wonderful territory with games. It's tough for me to write such a negative review. But I don't feel like Thirty Flights is worth the praise reviewers gave it, and I wish that more time had be spent making it coherent, thoughtful, and even fun.

The graphics aren't complex, the controls are simple- and yet the way everything is pieced together makes it a charming and fun experience you could only find in an indie game. Note that it comes with two games: Gravity Bone and Thirty Flights of Loving. I guess you could play Gravity Bone first as it is the prequel, but it didn't seem to make a huge difference for me.The playthroughs are very short- I'd say about 10-15 minutes each game.

Most people seem to make mention of either ""Why would I pay $5 for a game this short?"" or ""This isn't even a game."" Then they'd probably say ""Don't waste your money."" I am here to tell you otherwise.The game functions much like a film though it isn't, there is little interactivity but that seems to be the point of the experiance. I classify it as a game because there is interactivity, you the player are a part of the stary and you can interact (however limited) with the world around you unlike a film. From what I understand the game seems to be an experiment to try to fit as much story into a limited time frame, and with no dialogue. And to that it succeeds, even without dialogue the game accurately portrays a story just from the very limited character models and it even makes it engaging. It's paced well and is just overall really well made, especially for a game running on the Quake engine.It also comes with the game this is a successor to, Gravity Bone, which is a nice touch and is really great in it's own right. For $5 I still reccommend it, just for the experiance this game gives you."

Now, one might argue that the game is still enjoyable for the ""art"" or ""story"", but the game has neither that are exceptional. You can try to dissect some hidden meanings or interpret the vague ending anyway you want, but there is NOTHING there. This is the type of game that's left ambiguously vague because the creator is just uncreative and is taking advantage of dumb people. The game has NO replay value. It isn't a short and quick game because there is no game at all. It's not like a quick arena game that's addicting and you want to replay, no, it's nothing of the sort. And as I mentioned before, it isn't even a game that you'd want to replay to see if you can interpret the deep and powerful meaning behind the game's story. I will now write out the entire game to you right now.You walk down some stairs into a bar.Two guys just stare at you. You can't talk to them.You smash a few bottles to try and intice a response. The two guys continue to stare and not care.You go into a ""hidden"" door to your secret base where you meet your two best companions.Staring female and staring male. Interacting with them shows two soundless cutscenes (approx 30 seconds long) of their ""professions"".Their professions imply they are thieves and are about to make a heist of sorts with you.You can pick up some guns and ammunition on the tables. This does nothing at all. You're essentially clicking them to make them disappear.You go into a plane.Scene changes instantly.Oh no, your best friend, staring guy, is bleeding on the ground.You push him around an airport in a cart because you're weak and can't carry him.The airport is crowded with rejected minecraft characters that ignore your prescence and walk through you.Flashback to you and staring girl in an apartment. Implications you two are in love.You walk up a stairwell. There are more staring people on the rooftop having drinks.You sit with staring girl.Scene changes instantly.You go back to pushing your dying best friend, staring guy, around in the airport.You get a gun suddenly and shoot birds(?) out of the air. (THIS IS THE ONLY GAMEPLAY IN THE GAME ASIDE FROM WALKING AND THERE IS NO CONSEQUENCE IF YOU DO NOT SHOOT THE WHITE BIRD THINGS. YOU HAVE NO AMMO. NOTHING MATTERS.)You get into a car with staring guy. The car drives by itself.The end.You beat the game goodjob. Yes, it was 30 minutes even with taking your time. Yes, that was the whole game. Yes, you paid ten dollars. Yes, that's all you're getting. Yes, you didn't miss anything or unlock anything. You're still going to replay it out of disbelief of being ripped of so hard, aren't you? Okay, go for it. ...You back? Yes, that was indeed it. No, I agree. It wasn't profound and it didn't change your life. Yes, I'm upset with it too.

Do you value the EXPERIENCE of a game over what you can actually DO in a game?If you answered ""yes"" to all 4, this is definitely the game for you.

I do know that it's a roughly 10-15 minute experience telling a story about spies... carrying out a heist? ...I think? What I do know is that it was created by Brendon Chung, the one-man team behind Blendo Games who is also responsible for Flotilla, Atom Zombie Smasher and the upcoming Quadrilateral Cowboy. Thirty Flights of Loving (TFOL) was created as part of a Kickstarter campaign to support the Idle Thumbs podcast, of which I am a frequent listener. According to Chung, TFOL was an excercise in creating a game that tells a story without any dialogue. TFOL is certinaly a realization of that concept, but I don't think it's very successful in telling a clear and understandable storyPart of the problem here is that in order to get the whole picture of what's going on in TFOL, you had to have played some of Chung's previous games. TFOL opens by announcing that it's the sequel to a game called Gravity Bone, which is jarring to anyone (myself included) who wasn't aware of Gravity Bone and was expecting TFOL to be a standalone experience. I found TFOL to be a pretty hard and confusing game to parse through. Part of it is the lack of any dialogue, part of it is the smash cuts and non-linear presentation of the story, and part of it is the expectation that the audience has also played Gravity Bone. By doing a bit of research and also watching an excellent video by Errant Signal, I was able to find out that Gravity Bone is part of Chung's long running series of games called ""Citizen Abel"". Now I'm not sure if playing all of the other Citizen Abel games helps TFOL make more sense, but that's a lot to expect your audience to do espiecially considering some of the older Citizen Abel games are Quake II and Half Life II mods. And if having played those games doesn't contribute anything to the understanding of TFOL, why brand it as the sequel to Gravity Bone? I acknowledge that some my confusion with the story may be my own fault for not having played the other games, but this was one of several nits I had to pick with this game.As I mentioned earlier, the story in TFOL is told non-linearly and without any dialogue at all. As you might guess, it makes the story a bit hard to follow. Even though I played through the game twice to try to piece it together, I still can't come up with a reading on this game that isn't jumbled nonsense. I'd love to hear someone else's interpretation of the story though, if someone can actually manage to follow it and come up with an understanding.I'm all for smaller games made for a specific audience, so I feel bad picking on the little guy here. Nevertheless, I found TFOL to be a short and confusing experiment in weird and nonsensical storytelling.

There are mininal amount of words that can describe the depth to what is game is carrying out do yourself a favor and buy it it's an emotional roller coaster that will leave you in tears and will also make you laugh at times , The only problem i have with this game is that there are not even close to thirty flights and the only loving in the game is when you ♥♥♥♥ the brains out of this chick. Although with the tragic ending there is i suppose it tells you that love is the only thing eternal and we only have a small amount of time before we die so live it up and never look back 5/5 must buy game of the century. This game will teach you what love truly is, what friendship truly is, and what courage truly is. out of the the 40 times i've played this game it has made me cry almost everytime i've played it is just such a good game i CANNOT stress this enough i need another one of these games."

The Beginner's Guide is one of my favorite ""games"", and it's more of an expirience. Now, there are several things that made me return this.1. The Length. I beat it in 15 minutes, then again in 10. This is crazily short, and it dosen't have alot of replay value. This then goes to my next point.2. The Price. For every $5 a game costs, it should have at least 2 hours of gameplay. For example, a game that's $10 should  at least have 4 hours of gameplay. This game is $5 and has about 15 minutes of gameplay. That's terrible. This game should be a dollar, if anything.3. The Actual Gameplay. There is none, except you just walking around. Now don't get me wrong, I'm a huge fan of walking simulators, like as I said before, The Beginner's Guide is one of my favorite games. In that game you just walk around, but there's commentary and narration that drives you through. It has a story that drives you in. In this game the story is really bad. If the stories bad, then the gameplay should be the thing to drive you through, but all you do is walk.4. The Story. Like I said before, the story isn't good. Now, I read that it's filled with metaphors. The Beginner's Guide is also filled with metaphors. But in The Beginner's Guide, the story is good enough to make me want to know them. That makes replaying the game fun and interesting. But here, I honestly don't care. The story is bad to begin with, and that makes me just not care enough to bother to replay it. Also, the story has these seemingly random bits that are out of order, and are just dumb. The one that sticks out the most is the ending, in whichyou're driving on a motorcycle with a girl that loves you. You have to press e to continue, and when you do that she looks at you, and you get hit by a van, and then you switch into a car that gets hit a van.It's just stupid. I bet this is some metaphor, but as I mentioned above, I don't care enough to bother to look into it.Overall, I'd give it a 4/10. The settings are pretty good, and the soundtract is fantastic, but the 4 points I mention above really ruins the experience. This is the type of game where you buy it, play it, the return it.

With cube heads, a simple linear path, essentially no words (okay, that's a lie, I guess I mean nodialogue), and about fifteen minutes, it manages to be something of a masterclass in game storytelling, communicating at a level of effectiveness that verbose, exposition-heavy ""AAA"" rollercoasters would kill for.For me, the use of sharp cuts ahead in a scene, or between scenes, was worth the price of admission alone. It's a technique I've of course experienced in many many films, but I don't think I'veeverseen it used in games before, and it's a wonderful way of both creating (or perhaps emulating) a certain style, and putting you in the headspace needed to make the most of each scene.Yes, it's ""only"" fifteen minutes long, in the same way that, I don't know, Swift's seminal essay A Modest Proposal is only a few pages, or your favourite song only lasts three minutes thirty. If you're one of the people that (bizarrely, I maintain) measures experiences by dividing cost by length, this isn't for you. And I wasn't, you know, floored; blown away in amazement. But it isquietlyamazing; a significant accomplishment content to sit and do its own thing while the world shows off noisily around it.

The interaction/gameplay is minimal, as the entire game plays out like a movie.  The story itself is incredibly artistic and abstract with no narration, and will probably turn off a lot of traditional players of games (including a few PnC diehards).  The 'director's commentary' is very enlightening to bring a more mundane approach to the story, highlighting small details, to help gamers that found the story too confusing to begin with.  The game is sometimes so subtle in the story that smaller details can go completely unnoticed.I completed the entire game (seriously, everything the game offered), in 75 minutes.  This included time to hunt for bugs and glitches, do a little in game physics experimentation, watch all of the 'making of' movies in the commentary, commit suicide (wheeeee!) where possible, and of course explore every option in the option menu.  The average gamer will maybe get 45 minutes of entertainment out of it.I thought it was fun, but this game is better suited for aspiring game creators as a prototype to learn the art of storytelling than it is an actual game for most people.

But since people are actually playing the game itself rather than the rating, here is the reason why I've spend 2 hours on it (long enough for this short game).Like many indie games, this game shares some great features like everyone else, simple mechanism, extraordinary storyline etc. Thats not important for me.The point is the way the game telling the story is funny, its weird, its more like a interactive movie than a game (C'mon, dont reminds me of the real mess of game classification). But unlike others, this one didnt includes mass amount of metaphors(Im not blaming the metaphors), the author messing up the normal lineal storyline right to the point. This game drives you to think, for the pleasure. Thats might not be a big deal, but, if taking all the people, including the ones who just dont like (or cant understand) the metaphors into the consideration, that makes sense.Thinking is the highest level of entertainment.

You are a thief. You meet with two other master thieves, Anita and Borges, who have planned a heist. You proceed to fly to a building at which the robbery takes place. [SHOWN]2. You spend a day in the hotel planning/waiting for the heist (this the part where you see Anita throwing orange peels off the building). [SHOWN]3. As part of the heist you must pose as party guests, so you attend a party on the roof and everyone gets drunk. [SHOWN]4. You hook up with Anita (this is where things start to go wrong in the story). [SHOWN]5. You and Anita wake up in a hungover stupor; Borges is missing. [NOT SHOWN]6. Because the whole gang got drunk and woke up hungover and not ready for the heist, the heist is not set up properly and goes terribly wrong. Borges and Anita are both seriously injured. [NOT SHOWN]7. You and Borges escape through a mall/airport sort of place. [SHOWN] Anita manages to escape on her own somehow, despite her injuries. [NOT SHOWN]8. You and Borges, still escaping, face a standoff with police. [NOT SHOWN]9. During the standoff, Anita arrives in a getaway car, you get in and a chase ensues. [NOT SHOWN]10. The chase becomes deadly once Borges starts shooting at the police. At this moment the seriousness of the situation hits you; you realize you will not make it out of this. At this moment you have a fantasy: you realize you are in love with Anita, and you fantasize how nice it would be if you, her and Borges could live a simpler life if you just got away (the motorcycle scene). [SHOWN]11. In real life your car approaches a head-on collision with a semi, you can hear/see the semi in your dream and you come back to reality, and your car collides head-on with the semi. [SHOWN]I think the very end is ambiguous on purpose; it's not clear whether you survived the crash or died. The lobby you find yourself at the end could be a metaphor for the afterlife, or an extended life-flashing-before-your-eyes time for your character where he views previous parts of his life like museum exhibits."""

In a short space of time, using very basic tools, Thirty Flights of Loving is able to make you think and feel more than much longer and more highly produced games.  The blocky LEGO-like characters while incredibly basic still manage to express emotion and lend the game its own unique style.  Due credit must be given for the finely honed way in which the game engages the player's imagination.  However, it's hard to shake the feeling that this is more of game programming student's project worthy of an 'A' grade than a fully realized game.

,Recommended,214700,995357,"Posted: 23 May, 2013",all,Smokey Barrister,"Thirty Flights of Loving is a game that, just like To the Moon and Kentucky Route Zero, proves how powerful the interactive medium of video games can be in telling a story. Played from a first-person view, there is virtually no traditional gameplay, aside from being able to interact with the environment and explore its nooks and crannies. The soundtrack and the sound design are great, as well as its graphical presentation. The blocky characters, the usage of color, and the varied environments all mesh together into a game that looks quite unlike any other.But yes, there is nothing the player really does in the game, at least, not in the traditional sense. The real reason to play this game is for its story and, more specifically, the way the game presents its story. By employing the mechanics of film editing and cutting freely between events and scenes without any sort of input from the player, Thirty Flights of Loving spins the classic yarn of a heist gone horribly wrong in a wholly unique way. Its non-linearity and hectic pace is a refreshing change from the banality of most video game narratives, and the player truly has to work in order to understand everything that's happening. While the game can be completed in fifteen minutes or so, the scope and depth of the story told is one that far exceeds its actual runtime. Multiple playthroughs are not only necessary but also inevitable.Thirty Flights of Loving is certainly not for everyone. Many players have expressed outrage or frustration at the fact that the ""game"" isn't really much of one at all. Brendon Chung, the creator of the game, has himself described it as ""an interactive short story"". Ultimately, it does not matter. Thirty Filghts of Loving is a very important game, because it makes a legitimate attempt to tap into the vast potential for video games as a narrative medium. If that sounds at all interesting to you, go play Thirty Flights of Loving. It's an experience that you won't soon forget."

Unlike Gravity Bone, which had at least a few jumping puzzles, there is really no challenge at all to the game. The story also feels much less player-driven: as I mentioned before, it jumps around a lot in time instead of allowing the player to explore and experience the game at their own pace.Not worth $5.If you haven't played Gravity Bone, the original game, I implore you to check it out.

If you want to see the review of the game itself, scroll down to ""The Game(s) Itself""What I'm seeing mainly boils down to this:1) It costs too much.2) It's too short.As for the cost, well, this was previously featured in a Humble Bundle. So it was part of a package, where you had freedom to set a price. Currently, it's barely over $1 on the Holiday Sale.Is the normal asking price of $5 too much? Well, I would say yes, actually. The two games to me are effective, but very quick and not very good on replay unless you wait a while between plays, so it feels fresh on the next playthrough.I say a range of about $2-3 would be better, though a ""Set your own"" option would be perfect. (if that's possible on Steam...not sure.)Now for the game length.Unfortunately, the 1st game, ""Gravity Bone"", seems downplayed by not even being mentioned as available in the ""About the Game"" section, it just states that this is the sequel to it.I played through the 1st and 2nd game. It's found through ""Career"" in your Menu. Altogether, I spent about forty-five minutes, mainly because I got stumped in Gravity Bone while...looking for some birds. I even had to make a savepoint.Anyway, I found a great balance between the two:Gravity Bone is focused on the gameplay. More about finishing ""Objectives"".Thirty Flights is focused on story and emotion.Played back to back, you get far much more of a complete feel. The character is also the same across games.Playing Gravity Bone first is better, since Gravity Bone is not as big on story and introduces you to the mechanics of the game. Also, a character in Gravity Bone later makes a cameo in Thirty Flights.If one only plays Thirty Flights of Loving, I can completely understand that one would feel a bit underwhelmed by the rapidfire pace. Gravity Bone helps set up the story.The Game(s) ItselfFor what these games are, I think both managed to be extremely effective. They present experiences well without dragging things out, without filler or fluff, and with virtually no dialogue, as far as I remember.While playing these, instead of trying to rush through like you're speedrunning or something, it's good to at least let yourself get immersed in the games a bit.Due to the nature of the storytelling, it's like placing yourself in someone's shoes for a while. What stood out to me is that by the end of each, you can come away from them feeling a good bit of connection to the story, especially in the case of Thirty Flights.I personally think the way these games manage to present their stories well in such a short time frame is a great representation of what games can do. I would say I am quite proud that there is something like this that is challenging, even debatable (when considering the negative reviews) available to us gamers.I eagerly await the next game from Blendo;  hopefully this time around with a pay-what-you-will option, or at least a lower cost.NOTE: Two technical issues I did face. Gravity Bone crashed once while in fullscreen, I went to windowed, and never had that issue again. One small fix that would be worth the developer taking care of. Also my screen brightness seems to have been changed by the game, and I can't find out what specific system setting was altered. This does use the Quake 2 engine, so I may look into that...but I did manage to change it back through the brightness setting in the game until things looked calibrated again."

That too could have been expanded upon, with different objectives per mission. It's a boiling broth of potential that just leaves you with a taste of faceless brievity. If it's on sale (maybe a quid), then pick it up."

It takes about 15 minutes to complete and comes with the game Gravity Bone which takes about an equal amount to complete but has actual gameplay. That said, it is a very interesting thing and if you have ~2,50 to spare when its on sale, maybe grab it. The game does not have any dialogue and you are left to figure out the plot your self from the little disjointed sequences you go trough."

Both Gravity Bone(included) and Thirty Flights are extremely short, but surreal experiences. Is it worth the money? eh. If you think you'd like to fully experience the game then sure, but you can really just watch a youtube video. Not to forget the game is dissapointingly short. The game has many interesting and inspiring ideas that should be the creativity of most other games today."

It's barely even a game in the sense that you have any semblance of control. Rather, it's a genre-bending experiment with no linear narrative, yet is layered enough to evoke thoughtful interpretations of its meaning. Replayability is limited but the low price tag and visual flair are incentive enough to try it."

The game's unique aesthetic brings you to a universe tells a story that transitions akin to a comic book while leaving the player to interpret the events that happen around him/her.  While the game lasts for only 15 min, it pretty much tells it without filler and allows you to fill in certain ""gaps"" without losing the story.  A briliant concept that is hopefully explored for future games."

This is an incredibly engaging and unique experience that is simply incomparable to anything else out there. There is no way for me to tell you anything about the game without spoiling it. I would even advise against watching the trailer. What I will say is that this game is purely about story, and not about gameplay. Consider it a virtual picture book of sorts.That being said, this game is only 10 minutes long. You heard correctly. Ten minutes. If you include the second campaign in the package (which was the first project by this studio) you have a total of around 20 minutes. So if you are going to buy the game, get it on sale for a couple dollars. In my humble opinion, the money is well worth it."

It is still incredibly short, being maybe 15 minutes long... and the plot. Well I'm not even sure what the plot was, beyond being vaguely spy themed and involving a love interest. It just felt like it was missing a few extra key details that would take the plot from ""I don't know what happened"" to ""I'm notcertainwhat happened, but I have a few strong theories and an overall idea"". It didn't seem to understand the difference between ""up for intepretation"" and just being vague and confusing. There's not a great deal of repay value beyond looking for plot details you may have missed.I thought I was in for a treat, but I got something with less charm than Gravity Bone, and despite being free no real extra length or production value."

Others around me swear there is something there, but it's lost on me. This game is one of those 'not a games,' -- a pseudo game. It can be completed in less than five minutes and if you're like me, staring at the blank canvas and seeing art supplies, will feel your money would be better spent on something that is more of an actual game. Not a recommendation, just a word of caution."
