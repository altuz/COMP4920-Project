I mean, all this game is, is edward mcmillan bundling every flash game he ever made into one compendium that manages to be worth a tiny amount of money. While it isn't possible to review it, it is possible to recommend it."
,Recommended,214790,4324454,"Posted: 5 August, 2013",all,Gunderson Mallard,"Ed Mcmillen is, arguably, a video game auteur (though, no one would really contest that). If he isn't an auteur yet, he certainly is a recognizable personality and a welcome individual to the world of video games.The Basement Collection is a bundle of Mcmillen's flash work prior to his big hits (""Super How the Hell Did I Miscalculate That?"" and ""The Binding of Why The Hell Can't I Stop Playing?""). So, the big question is, do the games hold up?Well like any art or artist, it takes time to develop skill and hone one's-oh wait, nevermind these games are gold. Honestly, you would think that at some point Mcmillen and his team screwed up and made an awful game somewhere and had to bury it like a dirty secret.None of these games are some crayon drawing that a parent puts on the fridge to make themselves or their children feel better. The games included in this compilation are all fascinating and top notch, and all of them feel very different from one another. These games all share the familar Team Meat aesthetic and challenge. Out of the games here there should definitely be at least one that will warrant a purchase from you. Maybe it will be the somber story of the adventure game Aether? Or maybe the frantic Grey Matter? Maybe Time ♥♥♥♥, the perplexing puzzle platformer with a dark twist? If you can't find one game here to enjoy, there honestly might be nothing that pleases you."

The price is awesome, especially for this much content.Let's take a look at the games:Aether - Loved it, exploration game with some small puzzles. Controls could use some work, but this is a great concept. Could work in a standalone game.Time Fc*k - Another great concept. Puzzle game where you switch between layers to solve puzzles. Could work in a standalone game.Meat Boy - A classic! No controller support though (hard !! :().Grey Matter - Shoot 'em up without the shooting. Wasn't all that impressed, but it's ok.Coil - Something about a pregnant lady. Weird and the controls plain suck.Triachnid - Again, the controls suck. And no saves so you have to restart the game every time you exit. Nice concept, terrible execution.And then there's 2 secret games (one of them is AVGM which is all about mouse clicking, the other one is unknown as of now) and a whole lot of extra content (audio Q&A, artwork, etc.).If you liked (S)MB and/or Isaac buy this ![Rating: 80/100]"

Good & bad things I'd like to mention:- I had to restart the collection a few times in order to get a stable (max.) 30 FPS (again): 1 time while I started playing Aether (<10 FPS), multiple times while playing Spewer (15 - 20 FPS). I feel there's a problem with proper garbage collection > memory leaks;- You'd wish you could play most of the games at 60 FPS, especially Spewer. Not only does it make the game slow-paced, a low framerate also messes with your timing skills. And when it's about precision-platforming...- The original Meat Boy - with familiar achievements - already makes the collection worth it for me. This game might be available on the internet for free, and I've checked 2 sites, but it works awful for me there. So it's nice to have it in the collection, a bit more optimized?8/10"

,Not Recommended,214790,30586638,Posted: 18 March,all,Station Earth,"TL;DR Below.Like many other people say: You need to be a fan of Edmund in order to fully enjoy this collection. I myself had no idea who he was until I played this collection and his story is truly fascinating. I really do recommend people to go and hear his story because I'm sure many people can relate to him on different levels. Despite that, the majority of games were not my cup of tea but that doesn't necessarily mean they're horrible.I absolutely love Super Meat Boy and was amazed to find the original in the collection. Aether was also another interesting game I thoroughly enjoyed. Every other part of the collection was ""meh"" and I found it to be quite boring if not too frustrating to fully enjoy.Another problem I had was the frames. All games of the collection require little graphical demand to run and I have a top of the line CPU and GPU but still found games running at a frame rate as low as 10. This obstacle makes some games almost impossible to play as they require some complex platforming. The reasoning I believe is because they're made in flash and are in fact flash games. These are the infancy stages of what he's created and since they are flash games, you can easily find and play them elsewhere with better performance than on this, with no cost. That being said, you are in technicality paying for behind the scenes.Regardless of the problems I had, The Basement Collection is an interesting one at that and is one I can only recommend if you're quite fond of Edmund McMillen. The games as a game in my opinion are quite mediocre but that is because they are ""flash games"", but if you can connect to Edmund as well as his games then I think you would truly enjoy them. Being able to relate to Edmund can really make his games pieces of art.The collection as a whole unfortunately I cannot recommend because of it's performance issues, gameplay mediocrity, and price tag. Even though I said I recommend it to people who are fans of Edmund, and his story is fascinating, this review is geared towards the game/collection itself, not Edmund.TL;DR: You will only really enjoy the game/collection regardless of the poor performance fully if you meet very specific criteria. (Personal conflicts, Fan of Edmund McMillen, etc.) Buy at own discretion."

,Recommended,214790,30107509,Posted: 22 February,all,¡ IanBoy ¡,"The Basement Collection is a pretty nice variety of games made by the talented Edmund McMillen. It collections contains a bunch of games, which can be either found online or playable in this game only.Let's start with Meat Boy. If you played Super Meat Boy before, you should know the story. Your girlfriend Bandage Girl has been kidnapped by the evil Dr. Fetus. The plot is nearly the same, and was the original plot that later appeared in Super Meat Boy.In Spewer, you play as a little creature that tries to escape the scientist's lab by spewing puke, activate traps and avoid the traps. One of my definite favorites, and requires some thinking.Time ♥♥♥♥ (that's getting an sequel soon) is another puzzle game that features Steven, a person who has no idea in what situation he has trapped himself in and tries to find himself the way out. A very strange puzzle game.Coil features a story similar to well, how a person gets made. It's been a while since i finished that one. It's pretty short, but still a fun one-time experience.In Triachnid you play as a three-legged spider called Triachnid that wants to explore and find his lost larva. I always had trouble controlling this one, but you will get the hang of it.Aether has this kid that rides his octopus-like creature and sticks onto planets and discover the 5 different moons. The game also features some hard to find easter eggs that require both exploring and playing with coordinates.And finally, Grey Matter. This plays similar to a arcade game and you have to make triangular shapes as much as you can while avoiding all kinds of stuff. Quite difficult.Each of the games feature special unlockables and other stuff when completing certain chapters or the whole game. These may vary and could be things like prototypes, videos, art and more. There's also 2 special games that can be unlocked by completing multiple games.And that's the Basement Collection. Should you get it? I think you should. If you like Edmund's work or you just like to play a bunch of games in one with special unlockables, you will most likely have fun and have some rage-inducing moments. The $4 is definitely worth the price.I just would like to say that the game runs most games in Flash, and tend to make them laggier. The menu will not have this problem."

There's also Time ♥♥♥♥ which is one of my personal favourites...Time ♥♥♥♥ is truly an amazing game, the levels have you thinking the whole time about your next move and even the story is interesting for a game as such, you can create or download levels and there's also a mode which is called ""Enter the unknown"" which downloads a set of random levels and uses them to create a whole different experience from what the campaign's levels give.I'm not going to talk about all the games but if you really enjoy indie games then you should definitely get this collection...

He's also a genius. He's the man behind the modern classics Super Meat Boy and The Binding of Isaac, titles you should already recognize if you've been a Steam gamer for any amount of time.The Basement Collection is a compilation of his old flash games which made him famous on Newgrounds. Granted, it's an excellent compilation, complete with tons of extra levels and DVD extras, but whether it's worth your time or not really just boils down to the question ""How eager are you to play these games again?""I say this, because this collection mainly exists for historical significance alone. The games themselves are low-res, glitchy, have mildly-to-maddeningly infuriating controls, and most of them are simply exercises in masochism. They’re the type of game you beat just to be able to say you beat it, and that it’s finally over with. In other words, a good challenge. But if you want to unlock all the extras that make this package worth the money, you’ve got to play through the games again. So it all comes down to how appealing that sounds to you.If these games are important to you and mean something to you, if they were the games that defined your childhood and the games you'd secretly play in computer lab in high school or something, hey, I respect that. Buy it without hesitation and support the man who gave you hours of joy in your youth. We all have our nostalgia bombs and we have every right to indulge.But if you've never played these games before, there are much better Edmund McMillen games on the market, as well as better games to play for their historical significance alone; I recommend seeking those out instead.(Oh, and it’s also quite hard to 100%, so achievement hunters beware!)"

Classic Meat Boy is a hard as balls platformer that took me forever to 100% and all of these are completely different games. Great humor though through out all the games, and there are unlockable comics that are by the artists that is amazing, about a boy who hears a dead crow talking to him, it is adult context with a super simple look that a lot of these games posses a portion of.

The games themselves are also very good, most of them have plenty of replay value as well. However, since these are essentially older projects made with Flash, there are performance issues and glitches with some of the games, namely the Meat Boy prototype. I had troubles with it solely because of the terrible input delay. Other than that, I'd say this collection is great for any fan of Edmund McMillen or his games!"

Time ♥♥♥♥ for its reality-twisting 'story'. Many of the other games may drive you mad for their time-sensitive play-style requirements, but if you like McMillen games you know what you're in for.

I knew about Super Meat Boy, so I wanted to learn more about his style with this collection. So far I've only played Time ♥♥♥♥ so I'll talk about that:This game is the best mindf*ck I've experienced in a looong while. It exemplifies the struggle of self and identity, reality, life and death. What I love most about it is the main antagonist, who seems to be you from the future: now trapped in this alternate dimension of maze-like rooms you find yourself in (which feels an awful lot like purgatory). As you go room to room and solve puzzles, this other self constantly puts you down and spouts all sorts of disturbing nonsense, while simulatenously cheering you on and pleading for help. Imagine something like an existentialist GLaDos, only crazier and more negative. If you can imagine that.The game itself raises a multitude of philosophical questions and really makes you think deeply beyond the creative puzzles. The puzzles themselves can be maddening; the fact you have a limitless amount of lives and continues only adds to the sense of hopelessness, but you feel so fascinated and driven to keep going and solve each one, just to see what happens next..."

It's tedious to say the least.Finally Meat Boy is what it says on the tin; ever wanted to play Super Meat Boy with worse graphics, music, controls and on a keyboard? You're in luck! Nostalgia for the small crowd of people who were teenagers when Newgrounds was still ""a thing"".The Basement Collection is certainly a fascinating insight into the works that came before Super Meat Boy and the Binding of Isaac but from a gameplay perspective it is completely primitive and tiresome."

Edmund McMillen, the creator of Gish, The Binding of Isaac, and Super Meat Boy, shows off his early trials at interactive story telling including an early version of Super Meat Boy. Gameplay wise, they are all rough prototypes so each game in this collection is realitively short in content but a few can really be a pleasant time suck. I quite enjoyed Aether for longer than I care to admit, just exploring and playing with the physics of the game. All in all, it kind of feels like a semi-masterbatory auto-biography, but you can walk away with some fun gameplay and a bit of insite into the life of an early indie dev. 3.5 starsThis should be paired with a viewing ofIndie Game: The Movie."

Some of these games actually have very interesting ideas and design choices behind them and are more about telling stories or making a point than gameplay, like the simple but ultimately expressive A.V.G.M. or the really artsy Coil. The audio and video files that come with this collection also give you a great insight into the mind of one of the (imo) best indie game designers."

,Recommended,214790,33945064,Posted: 1 August,all,TangledAlmond,"Fantastic collection of games; was thoroughly entertained by every single one of the 8 games in the collection which I was honestly not expecting. The games may be available for free on newgrounds or something, but The Basement Collection gathers them all into one convenient location, as well as including new bonus levels for many of the games, progress saving, many numerous making-of videos, podcasts, and demos, achievements, soundtracks, and just a bunch of cool stuff. It really feels like a museum of sorts of Edmund's early works and I really enjoyed going through it all. Well worth the low price of $4 (and even lower during sales) to have it all at your fingertips."

It’s also great that it has same neat extras like early prototypes of the games and concept art. Plus it comes with the soundtracks from all of the games, and Steam achievements! Overall, great package for the money. Get it if you’re a fan of Edmund’s work."

I'm thrilled it is available in this Steam collection, but the fact that it never recieved a port on the DS/3DS is the single greatest missed opportunity in the  history of gaming."
