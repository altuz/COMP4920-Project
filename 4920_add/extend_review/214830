It'll make you spill juice on your good pants.Half-Minute Hero plays like a normal RPG on speed:  Each map has you grind, get new gear, and fight a big bad boss, with each RPG taking about only 3 to 5 minutes.  There are plenty of different maps with branching paths and titles to challenge to go through maps different ways.Unlike the 360 version, it comes with Evil Lord 30, which is a top-down beat'em'up where you summon monsters to beat up people, Princess 30 where you play a shoot'em'up under a very strict 30 second royal curfew, and Knight 30 where you protect your sage for 30 seconds against monsters.  All of these is more than reason enough to pick up this game if you are even remotely interested by the premise."

Balance speed vs. grinding vs. money management to solve each stage, contains 99% of the content of all other versions of the game... probably the ""ultimate"" variant. A crazy game which has some silly moments and a barrage of replay value given the multiple awards, unlocks, and branches each stage might come complete with.A speedy game deserves an equally-quick review, no?"

Unfortunately, the developers were too lazy to create multiplayer lobbies so you get matched with random people if anyone. In our case, we managed to play ONE game together before the multiplayer mode kept keeping us seperate.PLEASE NOTE. YOU CANNOT INVITE ANY OF YOUR FRIENDS. I'm not sure how the developers expected us to play with our friends, if you cannot invite or get into game with them. Really disappointed."

I know I did. In each level, you have 30 seconds to defeat the local evil lord before he casts the spell of destruction and destroys the entire world. Like, 30 actual seconds, so the gameplay can be quite fast-paced. You fight enemies for gold and xp/levels, buy stuff in towns, talk to people and do sidequests all in this short time limit, but you can turn back the clock by paying the time goddess increasingly large sums of gold. Very fun game, almost like a fast-paced puzzle game dressed up as an oldschool RPG. The levels are short and varied, which made it all too easy for me to lose large chunks of time to the game without noticing.This edition of the game has two graphic modes, an ""anime"" style, which looks really amateurish and terrible IMO, and a ""retro"" style, which looks like a SNES game and is nostalgic and awesome.The other game modes are fun, too, especially Princess 30, which plays mostly like a scrolling shmup. Hero 300 is pretty epic, too."

Not only are the game mechanics and gameplay really nice and pretty quick (which means this game is a wonderful time-killer!) but it's also got a cute little story which features many branching paths and a nice inventory system. Replaying past levels surprisingly don't feel too repetitive and is really fun. There are tons of challenges to complete, not to mention the difficult achievements which aren't impossible but just require a bit of extra effort!Overall a really solid game, 8/10 from me."
,Recommended,214830,34559194,Posted: 28 August,all,King Link,"In an age when everyone talks about length of games, Half Minute Hero does something different.  It looks at the biggest game it can make with a half minute of gameplay, and creates a rather compelling experience.Alright so it's not exactly a half minute of gameplay, my 22 hours of play time definitely shows that's not exactly what this is about.The idea before Half Minute Hero is that a spell of destruction is being cast, in 30 seconds the world will be destroyed, and you are the only one who can stop it.  During the first level it's clear it's not going to happen, and the world gets destroyed, but the Time Goddess comes in and offers to rewind time for you to the beginning of the 30 seconds.  Sounds great, only issue is she's greedy as can be.  She'll do this but she'll want money in return.From there, the game is rather simple.  Play for up to 30 seconds, reset time, and play for another 30 seconds, eventually becoming strong enough to beat a boss, and then you win the level.  That's a short game.Except there's at least 40 more levels waiting for you.  Yes the idea of this game is to produce ""30 second levels"" but there's also a ton of them, and each one has a charm and wit of it's own.  Some of them have unique systems, some of them have a side story, but they all are similar in the end.  Kill the evil lord casting a spell, and save the world.The gameplay loop is excellent, you'll be impressed by how much you can do in 30 seconds, but on top of that, the world is varied enough that you want to see what happens next.  Along with branching pathways, tons of equipment you can find, and allies, there's a LOT in what is called ""Hero 30"", the main part of the game.  It's exceptional.   In fact there's multiple endings, and since this is the rerelease, there's 7 fairly difficulty levels that weren't in the original game.I called it Hero 30, because there's multiple different modes... there's also an Evil Lord 30, Princess 30, Knight 30, Hero 300 and Hero 3.I'd be lying if I said the first three of these alternate modes are great.  Each one has 30 levels and they're a mixed bag.  Personally I like Evil Lord, am ambivalent to Princess, and get annoyed by Knight.   But one thing is for sure, they aren't the core of this game.  Hero 30 is the most fleshed out and interesting part of this game for a reason, and it's why you should buy this game.Then there's Hero 300, the finale, where everything comes together for an epic final battle.  This is a rather hard level but it is truly epic and when you finish it you feel like you accomplished something.And then there's Hero 3.  I would hate on it, but it's really here for the ultra hard mode of the game.  Instead of 30 seconds, you get 3, and that's TIGHT.  It's easily the hardest thing to do in the game, but I have a feeling if I really tried I could beat it, but it's going to require an amazing amount of time and practice to do.  Personally I skipped it, but this game has a really hard interesting challenge waiting for those who think they can tackle anything.And that's it....  Well that's the modes.  But with each mode, especially with Hero 30, you will spend a long time experiencing them exploring them and the for the most part it's good.  Alright with Hero 30, you'll have a great time, the rest like I said are hit and miss, but this is like a filet mignon on a plate with Asparagus, and a Potato.  You can like the sides, but you're here to eat the steak, and in this game you're here to play Hero 30, the rest of it is the accompaniment.Overall though I highly recommend this game for people who want to see how engaging a small game can be.  The fact is this game is unique in it's approach to gameplay, has a great style (I love the retro graphics more than the enhanced graphics, for the pixel graphics really shine), and a good amount of JRPG glory before it finishes.  In addition the fast gameplay loop allows you to revisit the stories, try different things and try to collect every piece of equipment without becoming too tedious.   I really enjoyed my time with the game, and the achievements gave me some different ways to approach the game.Note: While this review Half Minute Hero: Super Mega Neo Climax Ultimate Boy,  I would buy the sequel, Half Minute Hero: The Second Coming, as it's the same price, and you get both games for the price one one."

After the time goddess is killed by the big bad of the story (Who has been present in every story of this game) since no heroes appeared to defeat the evil lords, it seemed everything was lost, you play as a weak knight who was revived by a sage and your mission is to find the other 3 heroes, but is not gonna be easy since evil rules the world, and your only hope is a spell the sage knows but needs 30 seconds to cast it, your job is to protect him until the time runs outHero 300: the finale of the game, immediately after knight 30, the ultimate evil lord is revived, existance is beginning to disappear and is the job of the hero to recruit the other heroes and finish this once and for all.The game has a nice ammount of replay value, finding new ways to beat levels, or the secret path exclusive to super mega neo climax ultimate boy edition, well written and actually funny dialogueThe music is AMAZING, go and listen to some of its songs like the main theme, The hero arrives, To the high heavens, Melody of Happiness, Casablanca.

I first played this game on PSP and had no idea what to expect.  HMH pokes fun at many of JRPG's long running tropes while also feeling like a pretty fun game due to its unique mechanics.  In the main game, you only have 30 seconds to beat each stage while traveling from towns and obtaining items.  Thankfully, you can pay money to extend the time, but the cost increases with each use, so eventually you'll run out of either money or time (a la real life).  There's actually quite a bit of content here, as beating hero mode will unlock other modes that span different centuries in the same world (princess, sage, knight, etc), all culminating in an epic 300 second hero mode that brings all stories to a satisfying... climax.  Oh yeah, and you can play 3 second hero mode once all that's done too.  Is that really enough to earn the title ""Super Mega Neo Climax"" though?"

At least, for the first few hours.The game has a good amount of content, but every level basically plays like the last, and it doesn't have any other redeeming to qualities to make-up for that fact (such as sharp dialogue, for example). So what you're left with might be a monotonous slog that is helped along by, at best, very average dialogue.The game seems to go for a pick-up-and-put-down experience, and that's exactly how I tried to play it. But even after putting HMH down for a long time, and picking it up again, I always felt underwhelmed after completing a level, and always just wanted to quit.The other modes (Princess 30 and Beautiful Evil Villain 30) suffer from the same problem, and were -- arguably -- even worse when it came down to being repetitive, and having boring-to-average dialogue. So there are no saving graces to be found there.HMH is a game that spread its novelty way too thin (imagine if Portal 1 was a 30-hour game), and as a result, eventually becomes a mind-numbingly repetitive experience. It could have benefited from being a much shorter, and sharply-focused experience."

,Recommended,214830,11060431,"Posted: 3 July, 2014",all,Nyles Locke,"Truthfully, going into this game, I didn't know what to expect. With the name telling me I have 30 seconds to complete a mission, I thought it was going to be very easy. This is far from the case. As others have mentioned, this game makes you think strategically about when to grind, when to spend your money, how to spend said money, when the best time to fight the boss would be, etc. It's this balance while forcing you to think on your feet that makes it so interesting. Some missions you may beat the first time, others, especially the bonus missions, may take you two, or three, or even more attempts at them, but you will most likely end up loving it every time and, at least in my experience, rarely, if ever, ever give up in anger because it's that fun and addicting.Would I say it's one of the best games I've ever played? eh, not really, but it's definitely up there high on the list. Reason for this is while yes, the game is fantastic and addicting, it's also really repetitive. This is probably it's biggest, and only flaw in my eyes of the game. Now don't get me wrong, each stage is set up to give you a new challenge to get to the boss, such as monsters are absent from the map so you can't level up, an avalanche can hit you causing you to lose all your armor and weapons, etc. but at it's core, it's the same thing each level. Grind early, reset time, buy items, grind a bit more, reset time, proceed to go through the stage, reset time, fight boss, go to next stage, repeat.If the thought of repeating the same core gameplay every stage doesn't appeal to you then I'd recommend watching a few videos on youtube or watching other people play it on twitch or something first to see if it really isn't your thing. If you can look past this flaw then you will most likely enjoy this game and for ten dollars, it's not too bad of a price if you can afford it."

Its easy to just jump into and have fun with it.The music and visuals were nice - I much preferred the retro looking graphics. The newer ones looked kind of bad. You can change your visual setting so no biggie there.There were a lot of levels including hidden and alternate paths on the world map. Lots of things to gear your character out with which was cool.There are a few different game modes, but only one of them was really good. Doesn't hurt to have the extras though I suppose.Some problems were the game being locked to 720p - If you like the retro artstyle then its no biggie and the game will look played on a monitor with a larger native res. If you like the cartoony artstyle then it becomes a problem.Also, the multiplayer kinda' sucked because it had like no proper way to specifically play with friends or someone you want. It was so random. Not sure if anything relating it has been changed.Anyways, the couple flaws are easy to look past when the gameplay is so much fun. Its a fun take on a classic genre.

With it's whacky sense of humour and retro style this game has it all, packing a plethora of different game modes that can be played in short bursts or happily eat up a few hours of your time. The premise to the games main mode ""Hero 30"" is different to say the very least. What on the surface appears to be a retro Japanese RPG has actually been condensed into an insane amount of 30 second missions that lampoon traditional RPG tropes. Now this premise may sound completely broken but thanks to a wonderfully helplful deus ex machina known as ""The Time Goddess"" (who gives our hero some leeway with his thirty second time limit) it totally works.But that's not all! The game also has a few other modes up it's sleeve to give it a longevity boost that will keep you playing for more than half a minute. Princess 30 is a sidescrolling shooter where you play a kind hearted but borderline psychotic Princess who blasts her enemies with a semi-automatic repeating crossbow whilst being rushed around by a small army of guards. Evil Lord 30 is a real-time strategy game that puts you in the dapper outfit of the fabulous ""Beautiful Evil Lord"" who has renounced his evil ways so that he can grow flowers and drink tea with his newly beloved. When this peace and tranquility are threatened however the Evil Lord breaks out his summoning skills and unleashes wave after wave of monsters upon the castle's unsuspecting invaders. Knight 30 is an action game where you play as a lone knight protecting a wandering sage from hordes of monsters. The story here plays out a lot like Journey To The West (one of my favourite books of all time) which it clearly takes a great deal of inspiration from. The final two modes are Hero 300 and Hero 3 mode which are expansions upon Hero 30 mode that give you 300 and 3 second time limits respectively.If like me you are a retro gamer then you will adore Half Minute Hero. It does help if you have a whacky sense of humour, but even if you don't I'm sure you will still be able to appreciate the way the game lampoons those classic video game tropes that we all love and grew up with."

That's where Half Minute Hero shines: grinding is done in seconds, saving me so much time. However, this game has a timer at all times when you're out on your quest. If you run out of time, you fail and have to start that quest over. Sure, it's a quick restart, but a timer with a fail condition is pretty stressful for me, because I'm a cautious and slow-paced gamer by nature. I make all sorts of mistakes if I go too quickly, and am to stressed out to enjoy the game.If you like games where you're constantly fighting the clock, this is possibly right up your alley, but for anyone who doesn't like being under a timer virtually the whole game, I would avoid it."

Each board starts you at level 1 and gives you 30 seconds to run around and kill bad guys to level up and get gold which you use to buy equipment, heal up, or reset time.  Fighting happens automatically with your only options being to 1. Increase your attack speed while doing damage to yourself; 2. Run away; or 3. heal yourself during the battle if you've bought an herb.  Boards generally have multiple villages/towns/caves/etc that you can visit to talk to villagers and get various things.  Some boards have splitting paths or side missions/characters you can get for that board only.  You grind up enough levels until it says you're a higher level than the boss, then you go and defeat him at his castle.The problem with the game is that you're doing all of this for every single board.  Essentially, once you've played 3-4 boards, you've seen the whole game.  Most maps come down to whether you're a high enough level to beat the boss.  If you are, go fight boss, if not, then go grind some more until you are.  Dying in combat doesn't penalize you in any way that I've noticed, you simply go back to the starting village.  At the worst, you might have to run 3 seconds to get back to where you were.  It can actually be helpful to die at times if you're low on time and need to get back to the start village to reset the timer.  Also, for some strange reason, the game shows you what stats equipment increases but doesn't bother telling you what the stats actually mean.  I'm still not sure if weight is supposed to be a helpful or bad stat?  You can replay boards, but in order to do so, you must de-equip any equipment that you received on that board or after it, which is often a hassle.  Also, the inventory system for your equipment is a mess, making it annoying to find what you want to equip.The main factor in the game is supposed to be the time you have to complete a board, but it's often the least important factor.  This is because every board gives you the ability to reset the timer back up to 30 seconds while keeping all your stuff.  The cost of doing this goes up each time you do it during a board, but the cost is very minimal.  Resetting time once costs 100 gold, 2nd time costs 200 gold, and so on.  The problem is that you can grind out 500-1200 gold during those 30 seconds, so not having enough gold to reset the timer is almost never an issue and you'll have leveled up significantly during that time.  Most boards can be completed resetting the timer just once or twice, as you'll already be stronger than the boss by then.  Being able to reset the timer removes any sort of meaningful challenge from the game.There's not enough happening in this game to keep it interesting.  Quests often devolve down into fetch quests or go there and kill that thing.  Side characters are almost always useless since you can quickly grind up levels and beat the board without them.  Equipment is nice, but I'm still unsure on what some of the stats mean, and being a higher level negates the need for good equipment anyway.  The only useful equipment I found were the swimming gear to swim around on water boards, or the weapons that allow you to 1 hit kill certain monster types, but those are almost always only useful for killing some otherwise invincible mini-boss to complete a sidequest.  Being able to reset the timer makes the main draw of the game pointless.  They should've set the clock for 2 minutes with no way to reset, called the game 2 Minute Hero, and made players deal with the time limitation.  This would've made exploring boards more tense and actually given some meaning and challenge to the game.  Instead, it's just a pale imitation of the game that it should have been."

,Recommended,214830,13154235,"Posted: 29 November, 2014",all,DragonTroopBeta,"Very fun game. I love the fast-paced, yet not too difficult action. Essentually you have 30 seconds to beat a Zelda 2-style level, and you cannot finish it unless you grind enough EXP. You gain gold and EXP for battling enemies found randomly on the map, much like in Final Fantasy. This gold can be used to buy equipment such as armour, weapons and potions. But most of the gold you earn will be going towards praying at the Time Goddess' shrine to restart the timer so you can continue the mission. There's always a hurdle to get over,  like a broken bridge or a a locked gate that you need to go elsewhere first to pass through. This can be something as simple as getting an axe from town to cut down a tree, and later on can be as engaging as clearing a cave of baddies to get a gem, put the gem on the mountain, have the sun's rays intensify through it, creating a beam of light strong enough to burn down the blockade in your path.At the end of every level is a villian who was taught a spell of destruction that will destroy the world in 30 seconds (hence why you only have a half minute to complete the stage). He is much stronger than you when you start each level, but given 1-1.5 minutes of battling fuzzy forest imps and giant wasps and 400 gold worth of praying at the shrines and you can literally just walk right through him.The dialogue is witty, the game is addictive, and it has enough content to last you 8-12 hours, depending on if you want to get all the unlockable armours and weapons.I strongly recommend listening to the theme song on youtube. Amazing track. A game like this is definitely worth a try, especially if you are a fan of retro-rpg's, and would like a new take on the format.There's one thing I would not recommend doing: passing up a 50% off sale for this game. Final verdict is a solid 8/10. Well worth it's asking price."

It's a good thing I don't have a hard 30 second time limit to write this review otherwise I'd be broke with no equipment since I'd have to pay the Time Goddess so much.Enjoy the world of Half Minute Hero, where you play as one of several characters who are associated with a stingy Time Goddess who enjoys every bit of gold in her pockets.This takes every single trope that RPGs implement and runs with them. All in less than 30 seconds (per stage). While it is an RPG, the RPG aspect is replaced more by a puzzle aspect and requires you to balance your gold and time to defeat those pesky Evil Lords trying to cast a spell of destruction on the world. There's a good amount of humor, and I found myself laughing almost everytime I turn on this game. There's also several game modes, including Hero 30, Princess 30, and Evil Lord 30. The game puzzles can get rather hard with all the frantic action that happens (considering you have a 30 second time limit, it's not surprising). Just make sure you can think on your feet otherwise you may be on the receiving end of the Spell of Destruction by the Evil Lord across the street!But underneath the absurdity and the humor of the game also lies a well done story, not often seen in games. Don't think that this is a comedy through and through!Now if you'll excuse me, I need to pay the Time Goddess (again).This has been a Robot Maid Review.

The idea itself is simple, finish a level in a 30 second timeslot. While this sounds easy enough on paper, in game it makes every level, battle and quest a hectic race to go as fast as possible. Each level is its own RPG, with multiple ways to finish it, multiple quests and of course multiple characters to which you can ally yourself with.In game you have the oppurtunity to select which graphics style you prefer (Either NEO Cartoon mode or 16Bit mode). These choices will affect the game greatly, and you will want to finish this game twice just to see the different cutscenes.Without spoiling the start of the game, I can say with assurance that once you give this game 10 minutes, you will never stop playing.

Has a very unique style of gameplay, which is simple yet challanging (some quests achievements are very challenging).

Whether you are looking for a filler game to play periodically on the side, or a game that can be played for hours on end, this is a great buy. I've put in over 15 hours so far and have still not completed the one version of the game (there are at least 4 more modes that need to be unlocked to play), so I'd say definitely worth the money for this indie game.  ^_^"

76561198031478078,Recommended,214830,9735510,"Posted: 5 April, 2014",all,l0stmage,"I'd like to start out by stating what may not be obvious at first, Half Minute Hero: Super Mega Neo Climax Ultimate Boy is a combination of the PSP and XBox versions of the game.  If you've played either version, or both then you aren't missing much here.  With that said I this review (like most I suppose) are based entirely on what you believe to be important in a game.The premise of half minute hero is that an evil lord is working a spell to destroy the world, and you have 30 seconds to grind, upgrade your equipment, complete quests and defeat the 'Evil Lord'.  As frantic as it sounds (and can be) you have the Goddess of Time on your side, but as we all know Time is Money, and she will charge you for resetting the clock - while this isn't entirely burdensome it does become expensive quickly which encourages you to move quickly through each quest.The battle system is pretty straight forward requiring very little outside of keeping an eye on your health and using an herb if needed.The PC version has three modes: Hero 30 (which is RPG based), Evil Lord 30 (revolves around summoning minions) and Princess 30 (shooting), plus three unlockable modes (which I honestly haven't unlocked yet).The PC version also includes two graphics modes, retro and 8-bit which was released with the XBox version.  Personally I enjoy the retro look, but that's simply a matter of opinion.The charm and replayability of Half Minute hero is in the humor, multiple branching stories, collectible titles, and equipment.  Although the humor didn't always hit the mark with me, it was still charming in it's own right and although I haven't played through the entire Hero 30 (which is the core game-mode) I did find that collecting titles and unlocking branches could become a little onerous since some of the tasks and hints can be oblique, even with assistance from your caravan.I was initially hesitant to make this purchase because many of the reviews I had read weren't descriptive enough for me (which I hope this fixes for others), but overall I would give this game an 7/10, and dispite it's shortcomings there is more than enough content to justify $9.99, especially if you haven't played the PSP or XBox versions, if you have and you're still interested I would wait until this goes on sale."

Everything that's left is in its purest form, and it's still fairly entertaining, at least for a while. It unfortunately doesn't feel like it has a whole lot of room for depth in it, and while the rather generic and minimal story is cute and makes fun of RPG tropes, it's not enough to carry the rest of the game.It's worth checking out for some clever design and fun gameplay, but it may not be enough to last the entire length of the game."

There's ton of playablity in this game and some replay value as some stages have two different ways to complete it or have missable objectives that you can find in a new replay of the stage. Speed and time management are key in this game. Level grinding takes a few seconds to a few minutes so you aren't going to be playing for hours to reach level 100.After you beat the game there are tons of game modes that make the game different by giving you new challenges and gameplay styles different from the main hero. If you are an achievement hunter my advice to you would be to switch the game to classic graphics so you can unlock some of the achievements from the other game modes. When you change the graphics to classic to neo or vice versa the game style changes too. For example the Princess mode in neo graphic mode you rush enemies and try find certain items to save the King while in classic mode it's more of a shooter instead of rushing into foes and you have a time limit for reaching the objective to help villagers and saving the King. Either game mode you are bound to have fun and if you are fast enough you might make your way on the leaderboard. Good luck and save the future."

76561197983662248,Recommended,214830,11783907,"Posted: 19 August, 2014",all,TechieRefugee,"To start: I used to add a header to these reviews, but since it often made the reviews too long to submit, I've opted to leave it on my Backloggery page.Gameplay: The easiest way to imagine Half Minute Hero is that it is the Super Meat Boy of the RPG world. By that I mean that there are many small scenarios that you have to complete (the exact number is 30) within each mode. I'll be reviewing this game on a mode-by-mode basis, as there are four major modes: Hero 30, Evil 30, Princess 30, and Knight 30; each with their own variations, at least on classic mode. In fact, if you don't know to switch to Classic mode after you've beaten the game, you'll end up missing out on quite a bit of the game. This wasn't really mentioned anywhere - or at least that I remember - so do keep that in mind when you play through the game.To start, we'll talk about the ""vanilla mode,"" Hero 30. This mode consists of you traversing a given map and leveling up to the point where you can easily defeat the boss of the area. Of course, beating every single area in under 30 seconds would get tiresome after a while, so there is usually some new design concept per level. To compensate for longer levels, the game allows you to turn back time to the 30 second mark with a Goddess statue located at most villages. The fee for turning back time increases by 100 gold each iteration, and if you end up getting careless you could end up trapping yourself in a then-unwinnable situation. You kinda have to be trying to do that, though, so don't worry too much about that. Apart from that, it's pretty standard RPG fare: you can usually upgrade at least one of your equipment per map, you can carry one healing herb with you to heal should the need present itself, and battles are handled automatically with the main influence you have on the fight being that you can run in (running consumes HP, by the way) or turn back and run. Pretty straightforward stuff, but then again; depth isn't exactly necessary when your mission can be beaten in under a minute. It's also worth noting that unless you switch to Classic mode, the following three modes will be one mission long and play out roughly the same way as Hero 30.Evil 30 is, as mentioned above, pretty boring on non-Classic mode, but on Classic mode it becomes a lot more interesting. This plays a little more like an RTS than an RPG with you being able to summon three classes of allies to fight three classes of enemies (as the Evil Lord himself put it, a game of Rochambeau). Your summons become stronger the more filled up your summon ring gets, so that prevents against spamming, and this ring decreases when you get hit. This ring can be easily filled back up by going to the Goddess barrel (it makes sense kinda), but unlike Hero 30, turning back time takes all your gold, so there is an extra element of strategy to it. This one's my second favorite mode of the bunch.Princess 30 is my favorite of the bunch, as it plays like a SHMUP. The way that time is factored into this mode is that different terrain can slow down your squad, and the more you get hit, the slower you go. Turning back time is done by ""flying"" over red carpets, which take a certain amount of gold per tick to turn back time that amount (I don't know the rate, but I'd guess 10 Gold/0.4 seconds in four ticks per second). It is kinda easy to get ganked by some of the bigger enemies, but that never really caused me to outright lose the match, as I had plenty of gold to get time back. Definitely the best mode of the bunch.Knight 30, however, is the worst mode of the bunch by quite a large margin. The whole mode is essentially an escort mission with the most erratic difficulty curve I've ever seen. It tries so much to be a sort-of tower defense thing, but either the strategies you can make with the items are useless or impractical, save for the Fence which is the only thing you should make ever. There's just a lot of stuff here that is either unnecessary to the game or outright frustrating to play. Unless you're a completionist, give this mode a pass.All in all, though, I still had a lot of fun with the game. Sure, Knight 30 was awful, but at least it was only an hour or so of the total gameplay. I don't know how the hell Howlongtobeat has an average for this game of 18 hours, since I pretty much completed all the single-player stuff in a third of that time, but I still had a good time nonetheless. 8/10.Story: There actually is an over-arching storyline between the modes, so that's good. It's pretty standard RPG fare, although I think that was mainly for more of a parody angle than a lack of creativity. Also, this game is great if you've got even a slight bit of a Japanese sense of humor. Plenty of laughs to be had in here, even if some of the gags were predictable. There isn't really much else to talk about here, other than the Evil Lord being the strongest pervert. 8/10.Graphics: There's two graphical styles to this game: the ""modern"" tile sets and the classic tile sets. The modern looks (presumably) intentionally uninspired and kinda lazy, but that's to the game's benefit. Classic mode of course has pixel art, and the pixel art ain't bad, honestly. In fact, it's quite alright. Both are definitely good in their own ways. As for the technical side of things, of course anyone who can run at least Windows Vista shouldn't have any problem playing this game, since this is more or less a port of a PSP game, but the game handles fullscreen in a weird way. It does fullscreen to your native resolution, but it also upscales from 720p, meaning that you don't have true 1080p graphics or whatever your native resoluton happens to be. Because of this, I ended up playing windowed which worked fine, but I still would've liked proper 1080p. Also weirdly enough, the game prompts you to use a 360 controller at the start of the game, but all the commands on screen are listed as keyboard prompts. I'm sure DirectInput had a function to detect whether input was from a 360 controller or a keyboard back then, so excluding that seems really weird. Nevertheless, the two art styles this game presents are pretty good, but it is unfortunate some of the more quirky technical issues. 4/5.Sound: Only music to talk about here, and man does this game have a good soundtrack. It covers quite a few genres as well, from orchestral to rock to industrial... yeah, and it's all quite good. Definitely a game worth grabbing the OST for. Apart from that, there really isn't much else to talk about other than Evil 30 classic had the best songs of the game. 5/5.Overall scores are: 8/8/4/5; cumulative score of 8.3/10. Worth your time and definitely worth more than 30 seconds."

As for the gameplay in the main mode, it's pretty straight forward, you get into the map you have 30 seconds, you level up buy gear and kill the boss. Some levels are more diverse some are not. You also rescue companions along the way. The story is pretty simple at best but that doesn't stop it from being enjoyable, at least for me it didn't. Also all the non main game modes are different depending on what grafics settings you're using. If you want a game with indepth combat system and RPG elements like raising your skills and learning new spells and such, then this is not the game for you. But if you enjoy a game with simple mechanics but much to offer in terms of varierity I would recommend this one."

We all love those games with their menu based-combat, their complex story-lines, their lovable characters and their great atmosphere.

Square Enix? Yeah companies like them are the ones who've ruined the genre. The made one game after another. FINAL FANTASY, FINAL FANTASY2, FINAL FANTASY4, FINAL FANTASY 8, FINAL FANTASY 13, and soon FINAL FANTASY 15. They'll keep making more until no one will buy them anymore. But this, this friends will never happen. No matter how ♥♥♥♥♥♥ they are, they still get bought. Because die-hard fans like me will always buys them. So in the end we are the ones to blame!

But the creator made it in a way that you dont wan't to do it often.I also like the different gameplays. You get to play as different characters after you unlock them and there are a few different ways of attacking for each player. But thats in NEO cartoon mode. When you change the graphics you actually change the game. In NEO cartoon mode the battles are automatic like hero 30 mode. But in Retro mode you battle completley different. And that just makes it more fun.For those people that like story it has a good story about a 500 year old war and the many complications of the story. But also for the RPG players it has a few levels where you travle around and do ""complicated"" quests.

At the very least, you should watch some video gameplay. This game is an innovative mashup of different genres (primarily JRPG and Puzzle). If you enjoyed the PSP original, ever enjoyed JRPGs in your life, like to play puzzle games, or like quirky/innovative games... you should just stop reading and buy the game. If you're on the fence, I'll do my best to describe to you what this game is and what this game is not. I'm going to write a lot, but it's necessary to give a good picture of this game.(If you've played the PSP version before, skip to the end of the review for a list of changes made.)As you can tell, I'm a huge fan of this game. I enjoyed it a lot on the PSP and I enjoy it even more on the xbox. I'm going to be very enthusiastic in this review since I don't think many people even know the game exists and it can use all the hype it can get. But I seriously encourage you to at least try the demo, it's such a interesting concept that I think most gamers should at least experience it.I can't guarantee you'll like it. But who definitely won't like Half Minute Hero? People who loathe solving puzzles, the JRPG concept, japanese-quirky games, or non turnbased games. People who like the genres they're already playing and don't want to try something new. People who buy it expecting it to be a traditional JRPG. People who need top of the line graphics and voice acting to enjoy a game. People who need to spend more than 60 hours on a 10 dollar game.Needless to say, this game does not take 30 seconds to beat. It's not a 60 hour game either, but there isn't any fat... no grinding hours for items or toiling on mindless tasks.- Gameplay -The gameplay is a JRPG stripped down to its barest elements. It is not a traditional JRPG, although it uses the JRPG elements. The game is composed of several stages that could be mini-JRPGs in their own right (complete with title screen and credits.) You start off each stage at Level 1, although you can use any of the equipment you've found in previous stages. You get into random battles to kill monsters to get money and level up, buy equipment at villages, read through walls of dialogue, complete quests to progress the story, complete optional side quests to gain allies or special items, then ultimately defeat the Evil Lord threatening to destroy the world. The twist is that you have a 30 second timer to do all this and once that timer hits 0, it's game over. But you can pay an ever increasing sum to reset the timer to 30 seconds at any village. You can also dash around to move faster and avoid random battles, but while dashing, your HP is consumed.Battles are also stripped down to their barest elements and made to go as fast as possible. Battles are viewed from the side where you and your opponents simply run at each other. You clash, damage is dealt based on your respective stats, and you repeat until one of you is dead. You can choose to dash, which eats more of your life but makes the battle go faster, or use a healing item, which can be expensive and you need money to reset the timer, or run away if you don't think you'll win. Battles are still strategic... you have to decide when you can take an enemy and you can equip items that can cause the battle to be a lot easier (such as equipping a Silver weapon that can One Hit Kill demon enemies.) They're still exciting, especially late in the game when you might finish battles with milliseconds to spare, then need to rush to the nearest village to reset your time.The game parodies the JRPG genre and the different stages address the many tropes of JRPGs. Some stages focus around you needing to collect special equipment to defeat the big baddie, others have you do fetch quests, another has you chase your rival around, while others send you hunting for special monsters. There are 72 different stages and they're all really creative. As the game goes on, some new gimmicks are introduced. Most of the stages have different paths you can take to complete them. Sometimes you'll unlock hidden stages by finishing levels in unconventional ways. Some of the secret stages are really challenging.In my opinion, the best part of this game is the level design... there is so much packed into each level. In order to beat the stage at all, you'll probably play the stage one to three times. To unlock the titles (you gain titles by performing certain tasks in levels), collect all the equipment, or get the top times you'll need to play the stages a lot. It's a joy to go through them. Playing through a stage is like solving a small puzzle. And you can get that satisfied feeling of leveling up in a game and overpowering your enemies.Let me explain how a stage might work. I don't want to spoil anything, so I'm just making up an example, but the stages play out a lot like this. Here's what you can expect:In your first run through a stage, you might grind for a few minutes, pay 300G to recruit a mercenary ally from a bar, complete a sidequest for him by finding a memento left for him by his deceased wife in a cave that boosts his power, grind some more, reach level 60, then finally be strong enough to take out the mini-boss and the boss. You unlock a title and completed the stage in maybe five minutes (throughout the stage you'll be stopping at villages to chat, learn some backstory, heal, and reset the timer.)But then you play again. You grind for a bit and recruit the mercenary, but don't do his quest. You remember a townsperson in the first village mentioned something about a hidden village you ignored the first time, so you go searching for it this time. You go through a cave of monsters and find the village on a peninsula in a hidden patch of a forest. The shop there sells a demon slaying sword for 200G. You may need to grind for a minute to afford the sword, but now you can rush through the rest stage and One Hit KO the miniboss and boss. This will get you a new sword to use in future stages, unlock a title, and it took you only three minutes instead of five.Maybe you're satisfied with what you've done so far. Or maybe you want to get a lower score. Speedrunning may not be your thing, but it doesn't mean you won't enjoy the game. Even without the speed running, the stages are still really fun to go through and you can beat them no matter how good or bad you are at games. But if you want more of a challenge and want more gameplay, it's definitely an option.Let's say you looked at the leaderboard and saw people were beating the stage within 30 seconds and you want to figure out how. So you play the stage a ton of times, finding several new paths through the stage and some time shaving shortcuts. You finally get the 'Aha!' moment. You equip some armor that lets you swim, shoes that make you dash faster, and a sword that increases your base HP by 30. You don't equip a shield so you can move faster. You start the stage and dash off to a forest in the east, where there's a really weak monster that drops 230G, but no experience. Once you got the gold, you dash off to the village on the peninsula, taking a shortcut through the water this time. Because you're using the sword that boosts your base HP, you don't need to stop by any towns on the way to refill your HP. You use up all your money to buy the demon slaying sword and heal, but it doesn't matter because you're aiming to beat the stage within 30 seconds, so you don't need money to reset the timer. Now you rush through the rest of the stage, again through the water, and beat the mini-boss and the boss with a second to spare. You get nothing new, this playthrough was entirely optional, but you have the satisfaction of beating the stage in 29 seconds rather than three or five minutes. You can play again to lower your score even more. Maybe you took some wasted steps or maybe you finished the boss with a lot of life remaining and you realize you sh"

Half-Minute Hero is a silly and experimental RPG developed by Opus releasing in Japan and the US in 2009 on the PSP. After weak sales on the PSP the developers gave the game a second chance on the Xbox 360 and PC platforms. The game is split between 4 diverse game modes ""Hero 30"", ""Evil Lord 30"", ""Princess 30"" and ""Knight 30"" all centered around the half a minute theme.Gameplay:""Hero 30"" is the star of the game as it distills everything RPG down to their most basic elements. Each level is essentially a full RPG campaign where you'll start off at level one, talk to NPCs, gather info, take on quests, buy equipment, and grind your way up to the world destroying Evil Lord all in 30 seconds. Fortunately your allowed to turn back the clock for an incrementing fee of gold. This cost will eventually force you to find a quick way to complete the stage, so you'll need to move smart as the game values tactics over reflexes.Battles are automatic affairs where you and the enemy will ram each until one of you dies. Fortunately you have input through dashing which drains life so you can move faster (useable out of battle), use an item like a healing herb, and running away. Combat goes by in a flash but can be surprisingly tense as you'll have to worry whether you made the right preparations for a fight.As you can imagine such a simplified set of mechanics requires creative level design to make the most  out of it and you'd be right. Levels are packed with content and often provide a lot of freedom in completing an objective which will likely lead to repeated playthroughs to find secrets, collect gear, and find the quickest way to complete a level.Next up is ""Evil Lord 30"". This mode is a real-time strategy game where you play as a Evil Lord, where you play Rock, Paper, Scissors with creatures you summon against various enemies you'll face.  There are 3 types to account for and you can summon: high damage dealing Brutes; fast Nimbles; and long ranged Shooters. You're limited in how quickly you can summon creatures by the magic circle around the Evil Lord the smaller it is the weaker the creature you summon, so keep an eye on the size of your magic circle. Its quite satisfying to watch your army of massive minions trample over an enemy force when you've gotten a hang of exploiting enemy weakness. Unfortunately the simplified control scheme tends to work against this mode as you lack any precision when commanding your minions, since all you can do is tell all minions in your magic circle to charge in a specific direction.""Princess 30"", a scrolling shoot-em-up where you control a princess and her soldiers as she blasts her way through enemies with her crossbow to find a cure for her fathers sickness. The objective usually involves traveling across the stage by shooting enemies and avoiding hazards to defeat a boss or pick up an item, and make it back to the castle before time runs out. The stages will have you frantically avoiding obstacles and keeping you on your toes with some pretty interesting variety of enemies. But it can get repetitive due to having less variety in its objectives than the other modes so it's best played inter-spaced between play sessions of other modes.Lastly there's “Knight 30” where you control a perpetually optimistic knight who must guard the sage who brought him back to life. There's a surprisingly strong somber atmosphere here as you desperately search for a hero who will purge the evil that infests the world, through desolate settlements and castles you've been to before. The trademark humor is still present so it never gets particularly bleak.This isn't exactly just a set of escort mission either as the knight is too weak to actually kill any monsters, so he must depend on the sage's magic which takes 30 seconds to charge. The knight's job is to stall the creatures with anything he can his hands on such as rocks, sticks, and even his own body. He can also move the sage by either lifting him or calling him over, which will not only be necessary in finding a more defensible position. But also to get to areas that will speed up the sage's magic. This all plays on the strong level design of these stages as you need battle against new environments to keep the sage safe.There's also a multiplayer mode in the PC / 360 releases and it plays like ""Hero 30"" only multiple players will compete over who defeats the Evil Lord first on multiplayer unique maps. Its also very difficult to find people playing multiplayer, so I have little experience here.Story:There is actually a over-arching story tying these campaigns together which come together in fairly satisfying manner despite their simplicity. But its really the dialogue and self-aware humor that stand out as it has a lot fun with various RPG conventions/tropes. While still providing plethora of humor for those less experienced in the genre. Your constant companion the greedy Time Goddess is always good for a laugh as well.Something to note is the surprising moments of sincerity that almost seem to come out of left field. These rare moments juxtapose with the general satirical atmosphere while using the episodic nature of stages so well, that I found them completely unforgettable.All the story sequences are also skippable which makes replaying stages a lot more convenient.Presentation:The game has great presentation sporting a 8-bit art-style harkening back to the early Dragon Quest games. Alternatively there's the default paper-craft graphics of the PC release which you can switch between. While its not quite as fitting it will scale better on larger monitors. The soundtrack is also fantastic sporting quality rock and orchestral tracks from a variety well-known Japanese composers (Yuzo Koshiro, Motoi Sakuraba, Norihiko Hibino, etc.).Conclusion:Half-Minute Hero is a game with a lot heart. Its clear that the developers love the  genre or they couldn't have so lovingly satirized RPGs on both a story and mechanical level so well. I heartily recommend this game despite a few misgivings I have for the ""Evil Lord 30"" and ""Princess 30"" modes as they're still good fun. The main attraction ""Hero 30"" will definitely give you constant hours of entertainment especially since it'll likely tug on the inner explorer/completionist in you. To top it off its an excellent value at only $10 for PC.Notes:-Important: You can only play non-Hero 30 modes in the original 8-bit graphics style in the PC version.-You can get useful hints from your caravan, so make sure to talk to them.-The Goddess Room which contained unlockable artwork and the music player was removed in the 360 and PC releases.-Stat symbols can be a bit vague. So I'll try to explain them:Sword=Attack,  Armor = Defense, Boot = Speed, Weight = Weight, Target = Critical Hit, Shield = Evasion"

If you like witty humor, old-school graphics, and a good ol' grind-and-kill-the-bad-guy RPG, but don't have the time for it, then your prayers have been answered.Half-Minute Hero contains more than one game, for starters, such as Princess 30 and Evil Lord 30, each of them maintaining the speed factor and humor of Hero 30. It comes with two different graphics settings that not only (obviously) appear different, but also change how some of the games are played.So for those tight on time and cash but are looking for a speedy RPG, don't hesitate to pick up this little title. It's well worth every penny and every second.(Oh and it has head-to-head online multiplayer, too)"

Fairly lighthearted, pretty simple in concept but each battle does try to mix things up a little. I played through the story to the end (Hero 300) and it never felt like it got ""old"", but I feel like there were things that could've been done better.First and foremost, if you run out of time... why not just reset you back to the last point where you reset time instead of making you redo everything? I feel that would've been super easy to do, but nope, gotta restart the whole thing, which is really tedious. Really this is my one big complaint, it would've made the game a lot more fun and less stressful. I can nitpick about some other small things (some of the challenges feelng like filler, flee buttons literally never working for me, the overly-strictness of hero 300 despite it being one of the longest levels in the game, etc.) but really the main problems come down to this.If you want a fast-paced puzzle/RPG hybrid with some lightheartedness and not a looot of replayability but a decent bit of it (there's time challenges and titles and stuff that I couldn't be bothered to complete, meh) then you'll probably enjoy this, I'd probably put this game at ""meh"" if I had the option to but it's definitely alright enough to recommend, sure."

Naturally of course this is a single player, story driven RPG where grinding is THE ENTIRE POINT of the game and makes it of the best paced RPGs I have ever played. I mean, it's genius. Just take a story of a JRPG, have the combat system be the most optimal move auto-spammed endlessly (like a usual turned based RPG for grinding), and have the combat speed multiplied by 60. Then BAM! You take what would have been an half hour grinding in a dungeon in a regular RPG is turned into a half minute race against the clock to beat the boss. I suppose on that point it is less of an RPG and more of a puzzle game, where you attempt to find the most optimal way to grind and beat the boss in 30 seconds. Probably one of the best examples of good pacing in an RPG, with strangely enough the most grinding in any RPG ever (since time is relative)."
