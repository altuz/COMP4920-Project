The flight mechanics are... rough to say the least.  The keyboard mapping is almost absent from what I can tell.  Flying by mouse, there are maybe five or so keys including a second primary fire button... just in case your left click breaks.  Taking off from a carrier I found myself rocketed abruptly upwards by some mystical force halfway across the deck and then when landing stopped about as abruptly as hitting a brick wall.  The voice acting in the campaign felt a bit forced and was empty of depth or feeling (especially in the Japanese campaign) and didn't really contribute anything to a storyline.  The missions are extremely repetetive as well (bomb a target, switch planes, bomb said target again).On the better side, the game did have some pretty cool explosions and the planes burning out of the sky were as asthetically pleasing as it gets.  Bullet and cannon impacts in both soil and water are pretty well mimmicked although the auto aim defeats the whole purpose of WWII dogfighting.  Ships will sink if they are destroyed, which is nice, although I found it odd that the USS Arizona was capsized by torpedos and fully submerged in shallow water in about one full minute...All in all I'd say this game is worth 3 out of 10 stars.  Would not ever recommend this to anyone looking for a ""flight sim"" despite what any of the trailers or pictures make it out to be."

As a history buff, especially concerning the war in the Pacific, this game has piqued my interest for some time. However, there are several historical inaccuracies, and gameplay becomes repetitive after the fifth hour or so. I have encountered multiple graphical bugs, and a game crash at the end of the final Japanese mission. If you can get this game for five dollars or less, and you love flight simulators or World War 2 flight games, then by all means go ahead and pick it up. But if you want a game that truly shines when showing naval and aerial warfare in the Pacific Theater, check out the Battlestations duology. Otherwise, stay clear of this noble but poorly executed attempt to recreate the War in the Pacific."

I even tried to contract the developer AND even the lead programmer himself and they refuse any help at all.  It looks pretty in pictures... and plays so so.. but you will either have game stopping crashes, control issues where you cannot fly the plane (like a plane should fly) or just frustrating missions where the damage models are way off.  I wasted $9 on this piece of pretty crap and of course cannot get a refund.  Air Combat Secret Wars was fun... and I was hoping this was much better... looks MUCH better... plays MUCH worse.

Both campaigns are engaging and varied and the combat is pretty and fun.  Like previous installments, the AI occasionally forgets what it's supposed to do and flies in circles, but it's not a deal breaker as it's not constant.  Ship and plane explosions look as good in game as they do in the trailer and the multiplay is fast and fun.  Overall, expect an arcade flight sim and shooter, the management angles are very overhyped, but there are better games for that out.  You want a game to fly historic WWII naval aircraft that you and your friends can fight and bomb each other's carriers with?  This is your game.  Anything more in depth, keep looking."

As in its predecessor, this game stays fun because of its core combat mechanics. Because each encounter can unfold with slight differences, there's an inherent ""microvariety"" that keeps the game from becoming too repetitive. Also, the combat allows for quick rewards that can keep you hooked.The game isn't flawless by any means. Every once in a while, you'll run into an objective which has an unclear solution. There are also some issues with difficulty spikes, especially when squadron members are shot down before you even get a chance to make them useful. Also, the Japanese campaign seems to have a strange overabundance of ""intentionally unwinnable"" scenarios. If you know a bit of history, you can see these scenarios coming, but the way they're handled in terms of gameplay can be a little too vague at times.(Also, the graphics engine seems to struggle disproportionately when you fly through partially transparent features, like smoke.)""Pacific Carriers"" is rather more challenging than ""Secret Wars,"" especially since midair collisions have been implemented. Enemy fighters seem perfectly happy to simply smack into you, and you'll probably have a number of frustrating experiences where a squadron mate flies into you. On the flipside, I felt like this game allows for just that much more nuance in the flying, with working the throttle being much more meaningful than it was in ""Secret Wars.""Like its predecessor, this game has the potential to provide you with a gleeful and interesting romp through a number of air combat challenges. You do have to suspend your disbelief a bit, and the level of polish isn't quite ""AAA,"" but it's plenty good and worth a look."

Crashing on two PCs, which are clean installed, with newest drivers!Very simple game play and story. Controls are to simple, to have fun flying. After setting ""realistic mode"" there isn't really a change.Graphic isn't so bad."
