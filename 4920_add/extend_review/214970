It combines a bit of Contra with some Metal Slug and polishes it with slick animations, effective physics and responsive, modern controls. Not overly difficult, but not too easy. Even more impressive knowing that this game was made by only one person.http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=846819613http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=832551429Unlocked all achievements!"

This game never got the attention it deserved, and it's sad.In all seriousness though, this game isFANTASTIC.Not only that, but the soundtrack is amazing. The boss fights are amazing, and the game is a crazy metal slug-ish joyride of fun. The game gives you the feeling of nostalgia you got from when you played flash games when you were younger. This game is just 10 bucks too (as of 6/26/2017 on the Steam Summer Sale it is $3.00 and is COMPLETELY worth it.)If you aren't sure (which you should be because again this is AMAZING) just play the demo. The demo doesn't lie about anything. You get to play the first crazy action packed level and go through the first boss for free. It gives you a good idea of what the game feels like. You should seriously pick this up. You won't regret it."
,Recommended,214970,8059039,"Posted: 15 December, 2013",all,ej,"Great game. Enemy&boss designs are awesome(and I actually mean it!), physics effects are actually useful, music fits the gameplay. Most of the problems come from the fact that it was made with Flash. Controls are somewhat laggy, framerate seems to be capped at 30, but still doesn't feel smooth, bad gamepad support, etc. None of these problems are game-breaking though, just a minor irritation, for me at least.Update. I see that many reviewers compare it with Contra/Metal Slug and don't like the added physics effects. Well, this is NOT Contra. To me, its more like Abuse, which also was slower, controlled with mouse and involved slightly more thinking than average platform shooter. Physics, in my opinion, adds to the game, making every playthrough slightly unique, creating unexpected opportunities as well as irritations. I heard, this is called ""emergent gameplay"", but Nintendo kids seem to prefer games they can memorize and play by reflexes alone, instead of improvising, even a little."
76561198028049202,Recommended,214970,10752069,"Posted: 24 June, 2014",all,Kupo Games,"Intrusion 2 is basically Metal Slug with physics. Objects get thrown around, trees bend and wobble, and enemies wave their mechanical tentacles around.I didn’t really care much for the physics, but I guess that’s what made the gameplay a bit different from similar games. The mech designs were cool and the boss battles were epic. The final battle in particular was one of the most insane boss battles I’ve ever played in a game.My main criticism about Intrusion 2 is that the levels just dragged on for a bit too long. Enemies and scenery just repeated a few times too many. It took me over two hours to play through the game, while Metal Slug fits the same amount of content into a much shorter game with more replay-value."

76561198017953416,Recommended,214970,14180784,"Posted: 26 January, 2015",all,James Sunderland,"QUICK TIP: If you're having trouble downloading this game, try rebooting your computer in ""safe mode with network capabilities"" and then downloading it. It worked for me, and you can very easily Google how to do that. Once fully downloaded and installed you can just do a regular reboot again and it'll work fine.This is without a doubt my favorite side-scrolling shooter ever, and it should come highly recommended to anybody who likes games that can deliver both incredible spectacle and intense difficulty. And when I say spectacle, I do mean it: if anybody ever tells you indie games just cannot deliver the same kind of epic setpieces as AAA-titles, just point them towards this game.The more difficult the level, the more awesomely ridiculous the setpieces: from fist-pumping gunships, to wielding grenade-launchers off the backs of giant wolves, to a gun that is also a Tron-bike. And that's not even getting into the final boss, who I won't spoil here. So yeah, the presentation: awesome. The graphics are pixelly but more than detailed enough to convey the awesome action-scenes, and the soundtrack does an excellent job backing it all up. It's exactly the kind of fist-pumping hard rock you want out of a title like this, and it gets absolutely zero complaints from me.But I also mentioned difficulty, didn't I? Oh boy, the difficulty in this game... Okay, for the record: *yes* there is an Easy option, and it should at least let you get as far as the first boss fight. But this is not the kind of game where people who're just interested in the story can just coast along on Easy without having to worry about dying. This is a game where you pay attention, or you die. Literally, since the boss fights are all about memorizing their attack patterns and figuring out how to dodge them. And you won't do that on your first go. Or your second. Or third.But for as challenging as they are, it is not as though these fights are hard because it's unclear what to do. All the attacks make it pretty clear how to go about dodging them; it's just that the bosses have so much health that it's hard to perfectly remember and dodge those attacks so many times over the course of a fight. You *will* take damage: the trick is just doing more damage to them first.If you're the kind of person who saw this game or saw a Let's Play and thought, ""Man I wanna try that"" then you'll probably make it to the final boss on Easy. But if you're thinking of recommending this to someone as a casual indie title, forget it. This is not something you play on the bus home from work: this is something you play til 1 in the morning, when you finally beat that boss after 2 hours of trying & failing and you unironically shout, ""IN YOUR FACE!"" at your monitor.That's the Easy setting. As for Medium, it is exclusively the domain of hardcore fans or shooter veterans. Nobody else need apply. The Hard setting is for masochists who think Metal Gear Solid 2 at European Extreme just isn't challenging enough (yes I'm serious). However it is worth noting that despite those insane challenges, the game *does* actually have an initial difficulty curve. You won't get blown away in the first 10 minutes, if that's what worries you.If there are any downsides to the game, it's that (A) all that great challenging gameplay doesn't really have a narrative to go with it, and (B) the developer seems sadly reluctant to fix the downloading issue mentioned above (or tell people how to circumvent it: I spent a good hour finding out that tip I put at the start). The narrative is... barely there, to be honest. There's so little of it that you can't really call it bad or distracting: it certainly doesn't detract from the experience. It's just kind of a missed opportunity for the game to show that all your hard work actually has in-universe consequences.The downloading issue is annoying yes, but to be fair: when the game was originally released it wasn't there. It appeared after a patch and was never fixed. So I'm counting that as a mark against the dev, not the game itself. And again, the tip up top should work.So who would probably like this?- People who like side-scrolling shooters.- People who like a lot spectacle in their action games.- People who like seriously challenging/punishing difficulty.- People who like cheap indie games that are nonetheless stuffed with content.If you fall into any of those categories, the game is definitely worth its retail price and *ABSOLUTELY* worth picking up if it's on sale.But who probably wouldn't like this?- People who play games mainly for the story or characters.- People who don't like high challenge that's based on pattern-recognition.- People who don't like side-scrolling shooters.- People who don't like fist-pumping gunships.Those people should stay far away from this title. It will not float their boat, or any other flotation device for that matter.This game is the perfectly distilled essence of Side-Scrolling Shooter. What that means for you is your call. But for me, it means a 9/10.(Oh, and the final boss is Top 3 material. I'm not even kidding.)"

The bits in-between are still fun, but stand out less because the bosses are just so damn nifty. Probably the biggest issue is that the physics, while entertaining, have a habit of trapping items in awkward places. Still a charming romp well worth some fiddly bits and certainly replayable."

It does what it needs to do, and that is get you to have fun shooting a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of ammo.Movements can get weird at times and objects and debris can and WILL get in your path and shoots, preventing you from killing enemies and moving to avoid getting hit.Needs a lot of work on the movement part, as it can get clunky (especially while riding the wolfs) and would like a way to go down a platform whitout needing to go to the edge, fall, and move bak inside.Hard mode is not hard enough, just a few more enemies here and there. Enemies can be killed just as easy no matter what difficulty you are playing in.Would love to see more variety of weapons and/or upgrading system. As it is, I stopped using the pistol after I got the SMG (I guess, not sure), which is in the first minute, and then the rifle a couple levels after. Also granade launcher doesn't do much damage to big enemies and range is too short for my liking.This isn't metal slug or contra, but it still entertained me for a day until I got all the achievements. Beat the game 3 times as well. I do reccommend it, despite all the flaws."

76561198059877728,Recommended,214970,21669513,"Posted: 6 March, 2016",all,dejkbk,"The run-and-gun genre was a staple for arcades and home consoles in the late 1980s and throughout the 1990s, with classic series like Contra and Metal Slug. The run-and-gun genre was essentially a combination of the approach to player movement found in side-scrolling platformers with the blistering frenzy of the shoot-em-up genre. Fast-paced action, destruction and carnage, huge boss fights, and epic set pieces were all standard parts of the run-and-gun. Intrusion 2 returns to these sensibilities, but combines them with a physics-based design. As a physics-based game, objects tumble and fall over each other, bend under weight, or are pushed back by gun fire. Everything interacts, and the result is quite intriguing. By combining the relentless action of the run-and-gun with physics-based interactions, Intrusion 2 is wildly chaotic, and extremely fun. You can take out enemies by shooting them, but you can also tumble a rock onto them, or blast apart the structure they are standing on. It's more open-ended then your typical run-and-gun, and this adds a layer of unpredictability that perfectly compliments the emphasis on action-packed craziness. Also, it's a weird example of a side-scrolling game that is actually better played with keyboard and mouse, as it's mouse-oriented targeting system is refreshingly accurate. At the same time, Intrusion 2 is just as relentless and explosive as any Contra or Metal Slug game. Ride and shoot on the back of a massive wolf that can leap over buildings, or snowboard down a mountain while robotic serpent dragons explode out of the ground, Intrusion 2 has the over-the-top action-movie aesthetic that is classic to the run-and-gun genre.If you want a short, furious, overwhelming action game to play, Intrusion 2 is a pretty great pick. It's distinctive, but with a classic run-and-gun feel."

Unlike Capsized, though, it's actually a very fun title despite its absurd difficulty and challenge. It's also physics based so you'll need to think about your jump momentums as well as different items around the area which can be thrown around by gunfire or more hazardous means. You'll get to mount animals and mechs and fight enemy mechs in glorious and epic boss fights.The only let-down may be the high difficulty of this game even on normal which can really put a barrier on progression. Each level cleared feels like a real accomplishment.I wouldn't believe you if you said an action game made with flash can be as beautiful, complex and challenging as this but now that I've experienced it, I truly appreciate the work behind this game.

Its a little more difficult than alot of modern games, but the challenge is welcome and fair, although some of the boss fights can seem a bit lengthy.  Speaking of boss fights, while there are only 3, they are extremely fun and well crafted, probably the most memorable part of the game.  Riding wolves and piloting mechs in addition to the arsenal and enemies makes this game a blast.  The physics are a little wonky, but it makes for some really interesting gameplay.

It was done completely by 1 guy, which is impressive, the art style is interesting (if a little goofy at times), and the music can be pretty driving until you've heard them loop a dozen times.The boss fights are pretty cool, except they are basically impossible the first time through. You will lose repeatedly until you figure out the bosses' patterns.This may be the generally accepted mechanic for games like this, but I've always found it frustrating.The levels are very well-done, and are noticeably different each time. There are even little mini-levels where you're sliding down a snow-covered slope, which are a blast.The controls are serviceable with a 360 controller, and I've heard they're good with keyboard+mouse too. Sometimes, though, they genuinely get in the way, and the way the wolf moves is inherently weird. It works, though.The game is also rather short. I enjoyed it for the most part (other than dying 20+ times in the final boss alone. Frustrating to the max), but it's fun if you enjoy mindless side-scrolling shooters.The game is at it's best when you are frantically trying to dodge one enemy's bullets while shooting another. It's at it's worst when you're trying to time precision jumps or dodge boss projectiles, and the controls get in the way.If you use a 360 controller, I STRONGLY recommend you unbind the jump key from the analog stick, or you'll be jumping over and over and over and over and over when you never wanted to.

If you're the one who like sidescroll platform shooter with scifi-like weapons, then I recommend this, for sure. Second reason is this runs on Linux, which is big plus from/for me.Apart from this, the game has lot of potentials, and margin for furhter improvments. I would like to see more complex maps, like four-way platformer (see Turrican), as well as more secondary weapons as bombs, granades, etc."

I think that they could've done a lot more with the level designs. Just a touch of Metroidvania/Shadow Complex could've quadrupled the playtime of this game, in addition to taking advantage of the physics system they put in, but using it for puzzles etc., something they don't really do.The only thing I don't like about this game is its genero-guitar mush soundtrack.

The physics add something unique to this game, but unfortunately it gives some randomness to it.

Now, about a year or two (Or three, I can't remember), I bought this badass game and it does not dissapoint! Too sum up what I have seen in about 80+ minutes of playing, you play the game DIRECTLY after the events of the first game. You destroy towers, ride a wolf (Direwolf maybe) and destroy a gunship with arms that proceeds to flip the bird when you destroy it and fist pumps if it kills you. After that, you snowboard on a piece of it, killing the pilots of the gunship, six leviathan robot things and robot ninjas armed with rocket launchers. Then you find some wierd monkey robots (Which I hate, tbh) and fight mechs armed with swords, rocket launchers and guns. Then, after much badassery later, you fight the second bosses (and my personal favourites), Maku and Dan armed with lasers, grenades, lava, a disco ball of death and LOTS of memes.Thats all I can say without my brain melting for all the the badass crap in this game. 9042/10, would buy again."

Those kinds of physics that make boxes fly everywhere when you shoot them. This is might make/break this game for you. On one hand- you'll love when you balance those boxes just right to climb over an obstacle or use as improvised cover. On the other hand you're going to hate when you lose health after being hit by a random box, or when you cant collect a pickup or activate something because a box is ontop of it. I personally, think it adds to the game. The game is designed around it, with the right weapons and keeping an eye on your surrondings you can use the physics to your advantage. It also adds a degree of random to the game so you're always thinking on your toes.As for the rest of the game; it plays like a modern Contra with a dash of amazing. Challenging, a variety of weapons, epic bosses. Mech suits, Wolves you can ride on, a health bar, animations based on physics, depleting ammo and EPIC BOSSES!

76561198051743158,Recommended,214970,11008492,"Posted: 1 July, 2014",all,jslotkin,"The Genre: Keyboard/mouse or twin-stick shooting physics platformer.The Awesome: Crazy over the top enemy wave and boss design. The first boss is an elaborate, punishing, multi-stage battle where you keep thinking it's dead and it just...keeps...coming! Then it finally dies and you think perhaps the next level will get off to a more relaxing start, and instead you find yourself careening downhill on a fragment of the boss you just killed, while ninjas lob increasingly dangerous explosives at you...and then there are some airstrikes...and then the airstrikes start to include missiles that turn into giant robot snakes. I still haven't gotten past the snakes, so I don't know what else that sequence might hold, but it inspired me to write a review.The Good: All the things you can do with the game's physics. Lots of movable/destroyable objects, vehicles, enemies with individually destroyable, independently moving sections.The Bad: The physics and controls feel very loose and floaty. Movement could be tighter and objects could feel like they have more weight and heft. Sometime you try to jump and it doesn't quite happen. It doesn't generally prevent you from being able to move around and do skillful things, but it is annoying.The Ugly: The game autosaves at checkpoints, and they are very far apart. There are more frequent checkpoints that you return to when you die, but if you actually quit the game, you may find yourself much further back. Some people may appreciate this feature, since it makes the game more challenging and perhaps increases playtime, while others may be annoyed by it.Verdict: The ideas in here are so cool...with a little bit of tolerance for the imperfect controls/physics you can have a lot of fun with it...especially if you can let your imagination fill in some of the gaps between the execution and the level of awesomeness that the game is aiming at (and mostly achieves)."

,Recommended,214970,35015322,Posted: 16 September,all,ProfJimbo,"Okay, so I managed to finish this game. I tried using a Rock Candy controller first but cursor aiming was too hard, so I used a mouse and keyboard which was okay. This game is a flash game which I usually try to avoid, which is hard to without any tag for flash-based. Anyhow, how to rate this game.Graphically, the animations are loose joint kind, like there seems to be strings holding up characters.  Not alot of bright colors, which for a military type game is normal, and at 1080p textures and outlines are slightly dull. Backgrounds are the slightly blurred effect type-for an off in the distance effect.Gameplay, is going to depend on finding a good controller or mouse and keyboard. My keyboard is the normal big desktop kind; it has very squishy keys with slippery surfaces.  Anyhow, the main character has a floaty jump, and its height is affected by various factors: like unsteady ground or surfaces, carrying heavy guns, riding mech, jumping direction, springy objects like floatsom on water and tree branches and low ceiling of courese etc.  Aiming cursor is a big yellowish triangle, It is still easy to lose track of said cursor because the whole screen is targetable-not at the same time of course. But there is an particles gun that can pass through certain walls and objects and can target multiple enemies in a straight line. Besides riding a big Wolf that can squish slash enemies, there are mechs: grappling hook mech which grabs and throws barrels and light debris. Gun mech with sword and another combination mech with missiles. Enemies include standard unarmored to armored soldiers, mech riders, dragons that shoot, grab and or use a knife tail, wolves, fire-spewing balloons etc. Physics allow using barrels, rocks, snow, and expanding goo jars for defense, offense or for climbing. So there is lots of fun to be had experimenting there for fun of strategy.Bosses are good variety, flying grabbers, wild girl robot with elemental and gun weapons, and Mace the last boss. The last boss took me about 15 hours, but I kept getting stuck in debris or knocked off the edges. Finally, managed to get some pointers online, but I was lucky and memorization helped with getting ready for last boss phases.Decent game, and perhaps original, well, original from my experiences with these run and gun games. Game is short if the last boss does not phase you.If I had to make improvement suggestions I say: 1) make custom cursor color available-the last boss was same color as cursor. 2) on last boss the main character's waist to feet are cut off by camera and also when jumping off elevated stands the bottom of screen is cut off.I had alot of trouble with the debris piling up, sometimes getting hit by a barrel and flying off ledge. I finally just managed to quickly learn how to aim ahead of the giant enemy last boss and take off health quickly, especially at the beginning phase, still debris could help by blocking homing missles so its up to player preference."

Various weapons to use, good amount of ammo but not so much to were you don't have to think strategically about your use. Then when you need to spice up the gameplay, you get either some wolf to ride or a mech to jump into. These moments are just a lot of fun.But the lasting impression I have of this game was just how good, challenging and epic the boss fights are. particularly the end boss. For that reason alone you need to play this game. Highly enjoyable."
