,Not Recommended,215080,29639035,Posted: 1 February,all,Rosath,"(3000+ hrs on their own game launcher)If you decide to play any of this company's (Ankama) games (Dofus, Dofus Touch, Wakfu, Krosmaga, Krosmaster, etc.), do NOT invest yourself in it.While the games are unique in their genre and quite fun, Ankama will not hesitate to f*** you over big time. I was simply addicted to their main MMO, Dofus, and I could just not take it anymore. They're the worst company I have ever seen.Support is non existent, for once. If you issue is more complicated than a password reset, support will NOT help you. You will often have to reopen your closed tickets several times for the support to actually read your message. Most of their answers are some copy pasted crap that does not fit your issue at all.Second, and it's not so bad in itself compared to the other stuff, their updates don't make any sense at all. Tomorrow they might decide they change the whole game without consulting the community and they'll just roll with it. One ''funny'' moment was when they lost half of their player base deciding to switch from version 1.29 to 2.0 on their main PC game, Dofus. There was no options to stay on the old game, they just switched everything over and RIP. Let's not talk about how they willingly ruined 1v1 PVP, or how they keep making the same mistakes over and over without ever improving (rollbacks, awful class changes, awful mechanic changes, etc.)Which leads me to my third point, which made me delete their games. They sometimes throw events out where you get 2 times the xp, drop, etc etc. Pretty cool, uh? Everyone makes sure they barely sleep at all to play as much as possible and farm like hell. But what they did recently was just too much. A player found a way to generate their in-game cash shop items for free (please note that the items in themselves were not generating any value outside cosmetics and that they were linked for 3 months to the account that bought them). This was on Tuesday, and was noticed by the staff on friday. The issue was leaked in the whole community, and Ankama was well aware of the issue. No communication on their end, however (like usual) and the double week end went on. Everyone played the game like mad monkeys, my friends and myself included. We didn't sleep. We did some incredible things, pushed several characters to the ultimate level and generated for $1500 worth of in-game currency (legitely).Well, when the week-end ended, they rollbacked everything up to friday morning. Not only did they wiped, without warning, all the player's efforts, they did not wipe everything that was generated because of the bug. No apologies, and they did not answer to alternative ways players bringed up (which were pleeeentiful and legitimate ways to fix the bug). They do that at least 2 times a year since they exist. If you ask for a compensation for a very specific item that dropped when you have 1% of getting it, and worth $400... The support will say too bad for you pal.They're just lazy, and don't care about you. They only care about what you're going to inject in their cash shop. There's so many games out there that are great and are worth your time. I don't recommend you give it or any money to Ankama. You can google their reviews yourself, starting with ''rollback'', and have a good laugh.Oh, that and Wakfu's dying with no plans on reviving it.RIP."

I can't name a single other rpg where I even slighly cared about the economics or in-game politics, both of which were done so even the casual player easily understands the situation your country is in and even motivates you to get involved for rewards. The combat system, while generic, is fun enough with cool animations, decent enemy AI, and the moderate variety of skills you had at your disposal.However, the game is a buggy mess, the devs never listen, and somehow most updates make the game worse. The update that finally turned me away was sometime last year when the entire skill tree and progression system was gutted. Previously you earned skills in a certain tree by using skills in that tree, giving you freedom to build your character however you want and experiment. This update took that away and instead you stiffly and slowly go through all of the skills in all of your trees as you gain player level instead of the level of your skills. This basically tripled the level you need to be to get the skill loadout you want. Overall the game can be described as a mountain of wasted potential that continues to rot. But at least its free.[EDIT]Longing for the good ol' days, I might still play this from time to time because of a faint hope that the devs might get out of their own asses but also because there's still absolutely nothing like it (mostly because it's not trying to be WoW)"

Let's see if they finally do something right or  screw the few people left that are still playing the game..They had an amazing game with a unique concept and beautiful gameplay. Sadly like others have said they are probably one of the worst developers around, they don't listen to anybody unless it's too late, they focus on the wrong stuff most of the time and frankly they don't care if you love the game only that you buy stuff.For quite sometimes the  game  is only plagued by bad decisions so overall not recommended as long as ankama is behind it."

,Not Recommended,215080,29450842,Posted: 23 January,all,Yasai Tsume,"I played Wakfu a couple years back, then tried to get back in recently with a Freshly made character for testing purposes.They made Xp earned through fights terrible as hell now.In the past say, 30% of the Xp earned is gated behind Premium, which is cool, I think its a fine system which keeps the game free, yet rewards Premium purchase.But now, 70% of the Xp earned is gated behind Premium. Literally makes the game slow down so much for free players.Not sure if this is an action to severely gut the people who Power Level up to past 100 with help from friends, but this hurts newbies trying to level.Scaling is also terrible too, because while every other dungeon can have the difficulty level reduced to Rapid for faster clearing, Quest dungeons (Bovis) can't be tuned. The worse part is that the end boss of these type of dungeons usually aren't even hard, they trounce the player (at the recommended level) through pure stats and damage.If yur starting out in Wakfu, please get someone to carry, or there is little to no fun from Level 1 - 100, and even then, who is to say yur not already burnt out."
,Not Recommended,215080,30113853,Posted: 22 February,all,TA3,"Terrible. I've been playing it since the beta. Apart from the weird gamaplay and mechanic's decisions which is another big (but subjective) minus, the app is completely bugged out. You see people complaining about bugs at beta and these bugs are still there at the 5th anniversary. Multiple times their database glitches out leaving you without gear, throphies, costumes, materials and other stuff which took weeks to acquire. Best you get - some silly gift from Ankama as a ""compensation"", other times you're just completely being ignored by support.Game community keeps shrinking and that's no surprise. Comparing to what it was years ago, it's just dead now. Disappointed people log back in hoping something had been improved and abandon it again.Also there's no way of disabling unbearably lagging effects which makes you watch spells slo-mo and not being able to do turns in fight. And that's even on new computers with unsupported graphic cards. For instance, my 10 years old laptop with a supported graphic card runs it easily while on the new one with 8 gigs of RAM on the board the game lags out at you big time in fights."

,Recommended,215080,13204022,"Posted: 2 December, 2014",all,dean.dip,"Wakfu is a tactical MMORPG unlike any other MMO except for its prequel, Dofus.  It has play style similar to Final Fantasy Tactics where combat takes place in a grid.The character classes (15 of them) in Wakfu (and Dofus) have unique play styles and the classes themselves can be played many different ways.The spells have a variety of rules, and positioning makes a big factor in damage dealt/recieved.The art in this game is very charming.  It's very pleasing to just look at the content in the game.The music is very pleasing as well.  All from playful, cheery music to serious, blood-pumping music.There is a lot of humor in this game and a lot of funny parodies.  A lot of naughty references are in the game too, but are subtle enough that kids wouldn't (or shouldn't) understand.Of course, playing in a team with others is a lot of fun (and often necessary for tackling dungeons of your lvl).  Being in a guild & the in-game group finder tool helps with playing with others to enjoy the game better.Players can also make an impact on the environment.  Most mobs can be planted to have them spawn, and they can also be killed enough to have very little to no population in the area (sometimes ghost forms appear when that happens). Flowers, Trees, and crops can also be planted in the world and are shared with others, and they can also be completely harvested with none left for others.  Making certain plant/mob population too high or too low or just right can affect area bonuses and nation bonuses.  One nation (Riktus) benefits from other nations having their bonuses ruined.The environment, plus nation laws and wars set by a governor voted by its citizens (who then can appoint other people to different positions in government), makes for interesting experiences in the world.I've been playing this game for a long time (since open beta Jan 2012).  It's enjoyable and I recommend it."

Crafting is useful though be prepared to also grind for materials, and have professions require mats from different professions. There is government and PvP for those that like that.Interesting storyline and there are quests to be had. I've played since its beta and it has come a long way, mostly for the better I feel. Cash shop has mostly cosmetic purchases, and while free to play there are benefits for being a subscriber/premium member.A nice time sink for those MMO fans out there that want a different feel to the usual."

I know this comes off as incredibly negative review but I was trying to curb my frustration with this game for the simple reason that I REALLY wanted to like this game. The genre is SO rare to find a good version of it that isn't plagued by utter stupidity.The BIGGEST and most SACRELIGIOUS issue with this game is the TIMER. Don't EVER make a tactics game with a timer. There's NEVER a reason to do this and it just rushes things.Now ... this wouldn't have been such a massive issue if it wasn't for the fact that everything is SO hard to understand. The translations aren't HORRIBLE, but the descriptions are rather ... vague and subpar. They make figuring out how abilities work and effect function more trial and error than actual reading and understanding. Which is made harder by a short turn timer.Then you have an opening tutorial that does nothing to grease new players into the game. This will be a grindy game, from beginning to end. And in all the weirdest ways. Grinds in the typical ways of course too, but weird ways like forcing yourself to learn a new game that fights against you because the genre is so promising and the like.It's very painful to see such a pretty game turn me away because of simple, outright, horrible execution.
