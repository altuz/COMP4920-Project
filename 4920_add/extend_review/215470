Most were either ""meh"" or just bad. However, a few of them were gems; and Primal Carnage is one of them. This game succeeds what many games failed at creating: fun, cool, playable dinosaur gameplay.Playing as the dinosaurs is in third-person and is solid, though they could use a bit more polish. Playing as the larger dinos, such as the T-Rex & Carnotaurus may seem a bit slow to respond to turning, but it doesn't deter them, or the other dinosaurs from being fun to play as a whole. Each dinosaur plays similarly, but each brings their own unique class abilities to the table.The design & animation of the dinosaurs are amazing & life-like, and the DLC includes a ton of beautiful, high quality skins to use for your favorite dinosaur classes.Playing as the humans is also surprisingly fun. The control is fluid and reminiscent of more classic forms of first-person shooters like Halo & Team Fortress 2, having no ironsights for guns other then the sniper rifle. The classes have some creative members on their team, such as the Trapper who wields net gun and dual handguns.There is no form of progression system such as perks or upgrades. Though some may think the game lacking in that respect, it fits the game's simple approach to making a fun, easy to pick-up humans vs. dinosaurs multiplayer game. Though skins for the humans is still lacking compared to the number of dinosaur skins, the human DLC skins are fully remodeled and not simple reskins like as in many other games.Graphics are also top notch, rivaling many other higher budget games while at the same time not sacrificing natrual lighting and colorful environments for the filtered, cinematic atmosphere that many games today have.The classes are fairly balanced and the gameplay relies on teamwork like in the Left 4 Dead games rather than players running off on their own and doing their own thing like in most other online multiplayer games. The game is also constently updated and is driven by community feedback via the game's website.This game is definitely worth its price, especially as the game is still growing with more maps, gametypes, DLC, and more in the future."

,Recommended,215470,10198441,"Posted: 22 May, 2014",all,ThunderCorgi,"Edit: Please consider supporting the new Early Access gamePrimal Carnage: Extinction. This is basically an enhanced version of Primal Carnage. Featuring upgraded graphics, more dinosaurs aswell as new customization for both dinosaurs (skins) and humans (skins & weapons). There are also new game modes.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Primal Carnageis a fantastic Humans VS Dinos game that either consists of Team Deathmatch or a game mode with objectives. This game doesn't get enough credit for the amazing gameplay it offers.This game has unique and intense gameplay that is hard to find in games, for example:Playing as the Dinosaurs feels awesome. Sprinting and stalking through the maps as a raptor makes you feel like a true rogue waiting for the perfect moment to pounce your target and rip them to death only to disappear before the rest of the humans know what happened to their valued team member.Not just the Raptor, but every dinosaur has unique tactics to ensure your survival.The Dinosaurs- As a Dilophosaurus you'll mainly make up for your lack in strength and speed with tactics, sticking with the bigger predators     waiting for the perfect moment to spit your damaging and blinding poison at a human leaving them completely blind and defenseless.- As a Pteranodon you'll scan the ground for vulnerable prey to lift into the air and release at deadly heights, or above racing rivers.- Playing the ridiculously intimidating T-Rex or Spinosaurus mostly means offense is the best defense. You can eat humans to regain health and even trample them if they decide to get too close for your liking.- The Carnotaurus is a big brute with incredible speed and strength, sprinting headfirst into humans and smashing them in all directions with their strong attacks.Having mentioned that, the humans are definitely no pushover in this game. They might be slower and limited in their vision due to the first-person point of view but each of their classes brings valuable tools to the fight.The Humans- The trapper can lock a Raptor, Pteranodon or Dilophosaurus in a net, allowing them to come close and instantly dispatch them with their knife.- The scientist has a tranquilizer that impairs both the vision and speed of dinosaurs, allowing you (or your team) to escape a T-Rex or catch up to an escaping Raptor.- The Commando is an assault-type class that uses a grenade launcher to deal massive damage to both big and small targets.- The Trapper uses a shotgun to easily dispatch of the bigger beasts (if he can get close without being trampled) and flares to blind the Dinosaurs and force them to retreat.- The Pyromaniac uses a flamethrower to deal heavy over-time damage to dinosaurs aswell as a chainsaw to chop up a slow Dilophosaurus or an inaccurate Raptor.The elements of surprise, teamwork and variation in classes makes this game a blast to play. This is truly the first (online) game allowing you to play a dinosaur that isn't poorly executed. Everything feels incredibly fluent.I highly recommend you pick up this game, it's cheap for the (guaranteed!) hours of amazing gameplay you'll have. Playing together with a friend is especially fun as you'll either be:1. Terrified, because your evil friend is in the dinosaur team following your every move.2. Evil, because your terrified friend is in the human team and you're following his every move.3. Overconfident, because nothing beats a good Raptor tag-team.. untill you come across a trapper tag-team.The developers are still hard at work on implementingthe newest patchthat includes more human and dinosaur skins (including a Steam Community trading system), aswell as enhanced graphics and gameplay, overhauled maps and the whole new Horde Mode.Please show your support for this awesome game. :)"

Something they really doesnt need.There is only one map that is fair to both sides, and one that is better for human players. All the rest...dinosaur heaven.Game is alright if your only desire is to play a dino. But you will eventually get switched to the human sideAnd what can you expect there you may say?!1. T-rex unkillable. Just let it eat you unless your close to a house.2. raptors overuse their secondary attack which is pounce. Pounce can not be escaped unless raptor is low on stamina or is damaged. You will be pounced constantly as this is the only thing raptor players ever do.3. Super speed grabed by the birds..yes. its ridiculous fast. Your teamates cant react in time to even try save you.4. Shooting these two in the face as they attack you often does not interupt their grab/pounce. Something IT SHOULD DO!5. Sometimes when your beeing bitten/clawed at, your reloading is interupted... Leaving you defenseless.6. Trapper gun sometimes shoot a phantom/ghost nett instead of the real one. Causing you to hit the fire button again to trigger reload, but instead actually shooting your real net at nothing, wasting it.7. Dinos will gladly sneak around health boxes. When you do it as a human to the dinos Health box you instantly get: STOP FOOD CAMPING ""&""%¤!!Hypocrites.....8. The Commandos granade have to hit dead on to kill a smal dino. and sometimes it does nothing at all. Even on a direct hit!I remember the glorious days when you just had to hit at its feet to kill it Q_Q so Glorious!7. all forrest like maps got health and ammo crates far from eachother! usually.8. So much downtime as a human. you will find yourself short of ammo constantly.Dinos of course doesnt have this issue, as all of them have fast regenerating stamina which only is drained on running and jumping sadly(and pouncing and grabbing for raptor and bird). So really. they have no downtime to speak off.But yes. Game can be fun if you only play as a dino, though that isent fair to the one whos forced to play a human in your place.But in the end i cant recommend this game.Not in its current state.When patch 2.0 FINALY hits...then maybe.But not as of now."

,Not Recommended,215470,33608340,Posted: 17 July,all,CheekyChan,"I'm not sure why this game is still on the Steam Store for sale. Extinction is the same exact game but actually gets updated and has slightly more content. SO STOP BUYING THIS OLD OUT-DATED NO LONGER SUPPORTED VERSION OF THE GAME.This game was fun, not really addicting but whenever you felt the need to play a dino game it had it's moments. I bought this game for it's then full price, I think like $30? Might have been $20-25 then bought the ""new"" version for $12 or so dollars with their loyalty discount. The original title here never really delivered on it's promise but it was some decent fun, until the RP servers came into existence. Then there were no PVP games to be found. Then the devs announced that instead of updating this game they'd just release a new game, the same game with extra expensive random skins, items and hoo-hah, a lot of the same problems and more which, hey, it's a big update, there's bound to be bugs. But I've seen a lot of those bugs go unfixed to this day, don't remember them off the top of my head though, haven't played Extinction in a while. Actually, I remember one really annoying one, people who lag almost always have the advantage, if they play as a dino they can teleport you into their Ptero grab, Raptor pounce or T-Rex bite and if they're human, you often times die of a one shot kill while being nowhere near them or in their sight and the teleporting they do will mess with your ability as a dino to get them in a Raptor pounce, Ptero grab or T-Rex bite, they kept lowering the sizeof the T-Rex bite hit box because of this.It didn't happen all the time but now it happens a ton because the people who ARE there to play the actual game and NOT RP are in the few US servers with actual players from all over the world so it happens all the time now.Extinction didn't have many RP servers at first and it was all PVP so it was the same story as the original, fun for a little while until the RP servers came in and the Dino-furs moved into those servers instead of the PVP servers, again, ruining the game's PVP. I haven't played Extinction in forever because every time I go back there's one US and one EU PVP server which are barely populated.Now if you DO want Primal Carnage, GET EXTINCTION. But I don't really recommend it much, last I played nothing has changed, there's hardly ever updates and they almost never fix the main issues people complain of OVER and OVER again. Also, this review is for both games since they're essentially the same. Extinction has all the same content plus some extra content, mostly the same bugs and a bad skin system with Steam trading capabilities.EDIT: I'm putting this here because people need to stop buying this version AT LEAST. I haven't seen an update for it in years and the support on the forums is non-existent, devs have completely abandoned and moved on."

,Recommended,215470,28237093,"Posted: 7 December, 2016",all,Predatoria,"One thing I want to discuss in this review that I consider of highest priority is the state of the game’s community.  I saw many reviews claiming the game to be dead.  I disagree.  In my personal, albeit admittedly limited experience, I have been able to find active servers to play on.  In the evenings one can expect to find about 20-40 players online at any given time, often populating 1-3 of the seven or so servers.  Usually there is one crowded server with 20+ players in it and a smaller server that may have 2-10 players online, giving both the option of playing on a crowded or a less crowded server.  I must also stress that the servers populating are ones running game modes in spirit of the creators, not the RP servers that have engulfed the game’s successor.  There is only one RP server and it typically has 0-5 players online.Regarding gameplay, I’m a fairly new player to the series.  I scarcely played PCE and purchased PC just a couple days ago because many friends of mine suggested it was a better game.  So far I have enjoyed the gameplay.  There are two game modes that see frequent play, Team Deathmatch and Get to the Chopper, both of which I enjoy.  Mechanically, the game feels fluid and the physics and movement are well-designed, both for third-person dinosaur and first-person human play.  I’ve had no lag issues at all and hits register when they should do so.  The game has a very high skill ceiling, which admittedly has been tough as someone so new to the franchise entirely but it also encourages and entertains me by my desire to improve my own skill.  Even if I have rage-logged once or twice, I wouldn’t want this any other way.The entire basis of the game is humans versus dinosaurs, always in a team setting.  Of course I love playing as the dinosaurs, but I was also pleasantly surprised to find I didn’t dislike playing the human side.  It’s typical for me in games like these to heavily favor playing the animal side, but in Primal Carnage this isn’t the case.  The different humans you can choose from playing are comical, charismatic, and enjoyable to play with a wide array of weapons, each with its own set of strengths and weaknesses.  None seem particularly unbalanced or overpowered, and in general the dinosaur versus human establishment doesn’t feel one-sided.  Both sides are fun to play.Some of the maps are somewhat occluded, misty, and dark, giving good places to hide and ambush, whereas others are open and sunny so there’s good map variety.  They are also well sized, not being too big or too small.  A good balance of sneaking around and finding action has been struck by adequate map size.The graphics and sound of the game are adequate, but nothing particularly fancy.  I can’t comment too much on regard to optimization or graphics settings.  My computer handles the game fine on max settings with an Intel I7, 8GB of RAM, and an NVIDIA GeForce 980M card.  The dinosaur models aren’t the greatest, but it isn’t a particular point of grievance for me.  There are nice skins which I wish were unlockable in-game, but they’re only by purchase.To conclude, the game’s community is not dead.  It’s just small.  Gameplay is enjoyable and both sides are fun to play with good maps.  Graphics and models are adequate, though I wish I could earn skins in-game through play.  Sometimes small communities can be more fun than big ones, and I haven’t had trouble finding a place to play against others which is the main point I want to stress here.  I recommend playing."

None the less, I wanted to give this game a review, since it's one of my most beloved games ever.I've bought this game back in the day when it was still supported and not that long released on Steam yet. It was kinda an early early acces game, so before Steam's EA-phase. It was released, but still very early in development, it still would get more dinos, maps, more modes etcetera. But man I loved it. I love dinosaurs, I love shooting the place up, what could go wrong? Well, long story short; an abandoned game does the trick.I've spent many hours into this game. From the very first moment I played it, I loved it. It was my first MP-only game, so I was kinda new to this type of playing. But really, I got an awesome time! Playing as human was fun, and easy to learn and control. Playing as a dinosaur needed a lot more practice, but man once you nailed the control over it, you truly felt like a raging dinosaur. Run human, ruuuuuuuuun.I loved TDM (team death match), I loved GTC (get to chopper). Especially GTC. Spent most time playing on that mode. Met a lot of awesome, great skilled players. I started as an average player, but I ended as a great skilled one. Man, what a lot of epic battles I've played with a lot of great people, in the end it didn't matter which side won, it was always sure both sides would have to do all their best to win.Soooo, I drifted off a bit probably, sorry about that! So like I said, the game was still in early development, did rechieved updates, and some new maps. Even the Spino! But with more patches they bring out, the more the fundement behind the game began to shake. Bugs everywhere, balance gone. Glitches which annoyed the f*ck (beg my pardon) out of me. Which in the end because every f*cker (again, sorry) does it, you do it yourself too and became one of those f*ckers (ok, sorry, now I'm done).There would come a major fix, an update that would fix it all and after that they could bring in more game modes and maps and dinos and a lot of awesomenes! I can't remember how long we had to wait to hear something about it again. In the beginning they kept acting like the update was coming, in the end they confessed the game is just too messed up for fixing. They would have to rebuild it from the ground up. Which they did.The dev team couldn't get along with eachother anymore, had different opinions. They majority decided to bring out Primal Carnage: Exctinction. This would be the update for this game, Primal Carnage, but in the end costed so much time and man labor, that they had to bring out a new game to fund it. And this was the moment it went wrong. Every owner of Primal Carnage had to buy the new game. To be honest, I didn't understand the fuss about it. In the first couple of months Primal Carnage owners got something like 80% discount, so you could buy the game for just 3 bucks or something like that. And altho the new game needed better balance, and better controls, it wasn't thát bad. It looked good, and the basics worked. Yeah, it still needed (and needs) a lot of work. But the way the whole story went, from dropping this game after promising a (free) update, which ends up in a new game which people had to pay for, just destroyed the already tiny player base.

It's good, stupid fun no matter which side you play on, although a questionable option to switch sides midmatch occasionally leaves too many players stacked on the dino side.Parkouring dinosaurs, sub-horror moments of Velociraptor terror, and picking up a human as a Pteranodon and dropping them to their death are just a few reasons I love the concept and execution of Primal Carnage. It's just too bad that there's not more here to flesh out the more positive qualities and suppress the negative ones from seeping through.What's there is terrific, there just needs to be more of it. Here's hoping it doesn't go extinct before it evolves into something really great.Primal Carnage could become a better beast with updates, but at launch it's missing some key elements and polish. Despite those issues, Primal Carnage is still an entertaining experience."

Well, there's more.This game has amazing graphics for an Indie game. I'd still be impressed by them if it wasn't. (because I can easily be impressed by graphics. Even if, truthfully, they aren't great.)Playing as a human can be very frustrating, however, especially when a T-rex suddenly appears and there's only 6 of you.  If that happens, then your team is probably going to lose.Playing as a dinosaur is a different matter all together. There's something so satisfying about stalking a human, then leaping on them and tearing their face off. Yes. You heard me. Tearing their FACE off. Plus, it's hilarious to pick up a person as a Pteranodon and throwing them off a cliff. Like charging around and acting as if people are bowling pins? The Carno is for you. The T-rex can kill people by just stepping on them, and the Dilos? It's fun to blind people, let me say that much.There are some glitches, which sometimes are benefital. I have encountered no game-breaking bugs yet.Don't hesitate. Buy this game. You won't regret it. for £11 or 15$, it's worth it. I'd buy it if it was twice as much."

76561197969749884,Not Recommended,215470,33893119,Posted: 29 July,all,Sarkoth,"Primal Carnage is probably one of the most ridiculous gamedesigns since Natural Selection for the original Half-Life, which it also partially shamelessly copies from. It's dinosaurs against mercenaries for the most part and due to a large amount of different classes on both sides it is definitely a lot of fun to behold - in theory. Sadly, the game is close to dead currently which makes the multiplayer experience (as in the only experience, as there is no single player) quite a bit deserted and therefore more frustrating than fun.There's a lot of reasons I'd love to recommend Primal Carnage, but the lack of players is weighing deeper than that, therefore I cannot rate the game design and mechanics but have to rate the actual gameplay, which, without players, basically does not exist. You might want to check out the second entry in the series Extinction though, as it might have a larger playerbase and could be less abandoned."
,Recommended,215470,19078764,"Posted: 14 November, 2015",all,Green Apple,"Primal Carnageis a fairly simple game: you play as either a dinosaur or a human, and the goal is simply to be on the winning team. Each round can be around 20-30 minutes, and you have to use your skills in order to kill as many enemies as possible. It can be quite fast paced and sometimes stressful, but always fun regardless whether you play as a dinosaur or human.It's often on sale, and I'd recommend buying it then. The game is good for killing an hour or so of your time, but there really isn't anything more toPrimal Carnageother than maiming your opponents and the amount of maps is fairly small, so perhaps it's not a game one should pay full price for (there isn't a lot of content).Be aware that there often is a significant amount of lag regardless of your ping, and that does take away from the fun. But the lag isn't always there and it's sufferable. Anecdote:  One time I managed to lag severely while launching a jump attack as a Raptor, and somehow went flying across the entire map and into a cliff, where I died from the impact. Was going for a new personal record too, so that was a bit irritating... : PAll in all, I do recommend this game for people who enjoy dinosaur games and/or first person shooters."

,Recommended,215470,10225691,"Posted: 24 May, 2014",all,Mattias aka TT,"Primal Carnage is a fun online multiplayer game. The game is about humans and dinosaurs fighing each other. There are to modes so far but new things keep coming like they are going to make an campagin and adding a new game mode called horde. Anyways the 2 game modes there is right now is Deathmatch and get to the chopper. Deathmach is just a mode where you kill ontill either the dinosaurs or the humans gets 500 kills. This means the maches are going to be pretty long. The other mode (get to the chopper) is a domination tipe off thins where you capture a point and hold it for a period of time. When you have reach the goal there will come a chopper and pick you up but first you have to defend the area. The goal of the dinosaurs is to stop you at any course. This mode also fitures a spinosarus insteed of a T-rex insteed of 2000 hp it now has 4000 hp. The reason for this is probaly to make it easyer since a take down on a dinosaur is easy when the humans are stacked up and defending. There is 5 types of dinosaurs 6 if you count the spinosaurs. The 5 are T-rex, NovaRaptor, Canotarus, Peteranodon and Dilphosaurus. Each it unike apilites and play style. Novaraptor fucuses on agillity and quik attacks even so its fast its health bar is pretty low. Canotarus is a charge machine so to say all you do is charge up your speed and ram the enemy. T-rex might I add is good in almost every way you can run fast eat your orponens and walk them over. The only thing thats bad about it is the fact it turns really slow sometimes atleast. Dilphosarurus is a mix between range and meli it can shot posion that blinds the enemy for a shot while and apply a small amount off dmg for a shot time. It fucuses on blinding the enemy and then strike for a quik kill. The Peteranodon or Taradactel flys in the air and pick up people raise them up and then let them fall to there dead. It can also shout a scream that revials the enemy for a shot amond of time. The weaknes for this thing is its hard to get a kill since if you pick up a human and another human shoots you, you will drop the target instantly. There is also five tipes of humans. The each have specific roles there is Pyro, Trapper, Pathwalker, Cormandor and Scientist. The Pyro is a short range man with a flamethrower. It has a very small range but its deadly because it applys fire dmg over time. It also has a chainsaw attached to the flamethrower and it hurts like hell can even one shoot you if you aren't carefull. It has special granades that exloped almost instanly after it hits the ground. Scientist is a longe range sniper who uselly is used to take down Peteranodon or incoming Raptors. It also have a dart gun whould I call it if you hit an enemy with it then it starts to walk in a weird way because it makes them see unclear. Pathfinder is my favrite class because you have a shotgun and flares. The shotguns is exreamly good to take out Raptors and dilphosaurus. The flares does not only light up the area but also blind the enemy in the area the flare are in. The weaknes of this class is if it meets a T-rex its dead because it berly does dmg to it. Cormandor specialise in hevy weapons like machine guns and granade lunchers. This class is good to take down a T-rex because it can get fireing from a distens and enflic an anormes amound off dmg with granades. The weaknes is that its hard for it to kill a Raptor since its moving so fast. The last one the Trapper uses nets to ether cach dinosaurs for a small time or slower the bigger ones down. The Trapper also uses a pair of guns to inflec dmg on smaller dinosaurs its not that good against bigger ones like T-rex. Even though all humans have a meli attack like a knife or a eletical shocking stick or something, The Trapper is the only one who can one shot a dinosaur in the net. On to the mapps, so I am no quite sure but I believe there is around five mapps in total. Its critcal for both roles on witch map you are on because all the mapps force the player to play difrently. I believe its a good way to do that since it becomes lees boring if you played for a while. Enought of that all the mapps have a ammo case and a medical case for the humans scadered around the map. The dinos have corpses of a dead dinosaur. You can use thise things so you can keep youself alive even so if you are low on health or ran out of ammo. One thing to remmeber is that you can't do anything while you are healing or geting ammo so don't rush into it alone. The game is also good because you are constaly on the run and you gotta be on watch every second to stay alive. Its a hella good time for both pars exept if the dinosaurs are domenating because its hard to do anything against a T-rex. luckely there can only be 2-3 T-rexes debending on withs server you are playing on. There are even one map where you can avoivd a T-rex completliy because you can stay indo almost all the time. There are surten areas where T-rexes can't get in because its simply 2 big. The first time you come into the game is amazing since you can hear all thise gun shoots and dinosaurs screams. The ground is literly shacking/your screen when a T-rex are nearby to make the experiens twice as awesome. The game dosen't comes without flors like the T-rexes head sometimes gliches thow buildings and they can just eat you that way. It a stupid bug because you have no way of knowing it becuase you are already eaten. Sometimes when you are playing dinosaurs the move you are making is to fast for the screen to keep up with. Fx I didn't explain this yet the Raptor can leap forword using energi. energi deturmens how fast you can run for a shourt period of time both humans and dinos use it anyways. The Raptor can use a leap to hold you in a postioning that will kill you after sometime however you can sometimes break free either by an ally shoot the Raptor or I believe a bug or something. Nvm the leap sometimes gliches out and moves you 10 feet away form the target but you are still on him eating the ground. Overall this game is brilliant there are still somethings that needs to be fixed, and it becomes boring at sometimes so they dirently need a campaign to keep the players interested. The gameplay is fun the soundtrack is awesome and on top off that both parts are really fun to play even though humans are harder but still by my orpinion the funiest. Because you get a really go sence of satesfaction when you take down a T-rex or any other dinosaurs. So my final score for this game is a 7/10 great but could use inproment."

76561198049623202,Recommended,215470,7996512,"Posted: 10 December, 2013",all,Flav,"First off, I want to mention that I'm merely a mediocre first person shooter fan. I'm by no means a die hard fan of them, but certain titles I do love such as the Battlefield series.I was looking for a game that set itself apart from other shooters. And that ladies and gentlemen, is just what Primal Carnage does.Does the game have a plot or storyline? Nope. How about any singleplayer action? Not at all. No, it's entirely online PvP based. Even so, I still really like Primal Carnage. Do you want to know why? I'll tell you why. Dinosaurs! THAT'S WHY!Upon changing your video settings and joining a server that tickles your fancy, you'll have to join either the humans or dinosaurs. Both teams have five classes, except in the ""Get to the Chopper"" game mode, where the dinosaurs have the option to be a different dinosaur. All classes for both sides have their strengths and weaknesses which is good to see and balances out the game nicely.Aside from ""Team Deathmatch"" there's also Get to The Chopper"" which I mentioned earlier. This game mode is objective based, with humans aiming to ultimately escape. I personally haven't played this gamemode very much, I prefer standard deathmatch as it's simple and really fun.Each human has their ups and downs, but most of the time I find myself playing as a commando because of the simplicity of the gun a grenade launcher. Other classes include a Trapper, Scientist (sniper), Pyro (flamethrower) and a Pathfinder (kind of a maverick.)Playing as each different dinosaur feels really different too. Some are small (novaraptor, dilophosaurus), some are bigger (carnotaurus and a T-Rex!) and there's even one that flies (pteranodon)!So overall, Primal Carnage has great variety and is absolutely some great fun to play. It's also relatively inexpensive on Steam (and Origin, if you swing that way.) A real gem.It gets 9/10 from me."

This game is just perfect for you.HumorPrimal Carnage is a lot more amusing than I thought it would have been when I tryed it out for the first time.I thought it would be in some way very serious.This is not the case at all.Primal Carnage has this great humor you also see in a game like TF2.It doesn't take itself too serious and the weird things that can happen in this game makes it so much better to play.When I play this game I'm mostly laughing all the time... Just as I am when I play TF2.Things like flying ragdolls and weird death-posisitions brings a lot of humor into this game.Strategy and teamworkThis game is not only about killing everyone you meet who isn't on your team.Just as with TF2 this game is also a lot about strategy.Teamwork is key in this game. If you play as 10 humans who aren't staying together as a team - then you're pretty doomed...There are also different gamemodes - it's notonlyabout killing and slaughtering...First person / third personI think some people might say that it is pretty OP that the dinosaurs have a third person view while the humans have a first person view.I just think that this adds to the feeling of the game.The feeling of being that lone human who haven't got any overview of the situation while knowing that a dinosaur might be watching you without you even knowing...Or hearing and feeling the shaking in the ground from the footsteps of a T-rex, well knowing that soon it'll catch up with you.I have had some very intense moments playing this game - but that is also why I love it.Dinosaurs!If you don't like dinosaurs... Then it should be obvious you wouldn't enjoy this game with all it's neck-wrecking, acid-spitting and stamping tiny humans to death...Any downsides?The only downside to this game is thatsometimesthe servers don't show up in the server-list... But that's not harder to fix than restarting the game..."

Dinosaurs haven't held up too well in the gaming industry since the last Turok game, and there have been many games trying to bring it back to life, so far the closest one in my opinion is Primal Carnage. The game itself has excellent graphics, renderring beautiful enviroments, and whilst the gameplay itself is limited and quite buggy in times, it is great fun to charge at humans as a giant T-rex, gulping up helpless platyers who run in your path. Even playing the humans can be quite fun. My biggest complaints about this game so far seem to be the map sizes, which can perform imbalances towards the humans as players form large groups which take a lot of cannon fodder to break apart, as most dinosaur players are simply too scattered around the place to intervene.Not to mention when you're playing a game where a group of humans are fighting against swarms of dinosaurs, there's a hell of a lot of over-the-top stuff to laugh about.The average price in this game isn't too bad, though I'd wait for a steam sale before buying it, especially since I consider the skin DLC's to offer some pretty cool dino-skins. On sales I'd reccomend this game for any dino-lover who's looking for a good time from the more competitive games out there."

I haven't played for very long, but here are my observations.Here's how a typical deathmatch works out:1. Everyone starts out seperated. If you're the dinosaurs, you're in for a buffet. If you're the mercinaries, then your best bet is to put away your pride and team up with the nearest person you see. When someone get pounced, you need to save them otherwise you're next. If you come across a T-rex...RUN. Use buildings and use the Rex's turning radius against it.2. Eventually, all the humans end up grouped together near warehouses where there are meds and ammo. They typically die a lot less, but either the kills become too scarce to stay there or they become overrun.3. Later in the game, the humans spread out in groups of about five or so and end up camping near ammo and med boxs scattered across the map (normally in 2-3 areas). Don't worry if you're the dinosaurs when the humans begin to camp. There are no invulnerable 'safe' spots for them to hide. If you employ hit-and-run tactics, you'll do fine.And that's how a typical match works out. If all you play is COD and Battlefield, lemme just say you're in for hurt and there is a steep learning curve (no health regen, fixed classes, no killstreaks). The dinosaurs are also not OP, so don't expect to win because the game is well balanced. If you hate COD and Battlefield and remember better times in gaming, well, your skill wil transfer very well here. However, there is one COD skill that helps-training. If you're a true non-camping pro at zombies, then you know what this is. You can use the turning radius of most of the dinosaurs (raptors, carnosaurs, T-rex) against them. However, do not rely on this solely. This will only work at near point-blank range and you're open to be flanked. While camping is also a valid strategy, again this should not be relied on solely. You can easily be jumped by a raptor if you're alone and picked up by a flying type when roof camping. There are NO invunerable spots that I've seen used successfully. Cheap tactics can only go so far.Overall, if you're a whinny casual gaming jerk stay away no one wants you. If you're a team-playing core gamer who relys on sound cues and doesn't like information spam or weapon unlock systems, welcome."

If you mousewheel while in observer mode, you can scroll through different players. :D Great screenshots just from that. What a story you could tell with what you see in observer mode.. ^.^I'd have to say, if you like dinosaurs, guns, matches (battles), and role-playing, you'll probably like this game. Interesting to play as other things, like dinosaurs. I like the concept. It looks pretty fun to play, though I like observing before I try. I have no idea what I'm doing with it yet. But at this point, though early on, I do recommend it to others who like this type of game.On a down note, During the countdown after watching as an observer, my game popped up an alert that offered two options, one was to close (I think the other was to send a report to microsoft). I just closed it at this point. Going to try again...Tried again and I LOVE THIS GAME! haha.. I do not role-play, I just play and this version has that ability. I heard the second version is mainly Role-Playing so I'll stick with this one. You can LAN this game as well, or join a server.  It takes a bit to learn how to utilize your charater to it's potential but once you figure it out, you are hunting and attacking quite well at times. I still find myself running out of energy with the raptor and running in circles trying to claw my opponent until I die or run off..  You have to be a good aim and plan your attacks. You can crouch down to be silent but if you jump or roar, you are more likely to be seen."

Primal Carnage is a team-based PvP game with, you guessed it, Dinos and Humans. The only plot is that there's an island where Dinosaurs have been reborn (Jurassic Park gone wrong?) and humans get trapped on the island. The classes are pretty basic, each one has a main and secondary attack, along with Dinos getting a roar ability which buffs other Dinos. The concept of gigantic Tyranosaurs and Spinosaurs isn't as overpowered as you might think, and they pulled it off pretty well, although obviously if you got someone good playing he'll probably wreck your team.There isn't a big community left, mind you, but it isn't hard finding a full server if you want to play a couple rounds of Dino smashing or Human stompin'.

I'm a total Dino-Nerd.However, I can still write an unbiased review, and here it is.This game has a very unique style of play. On one side you have the larger, more physically equipped Dinosaurs, which you play from 3rd person view. The game does a pretty good job of balancing them with the humans. You can have very few Tyrannosaurs on your team, and the frequency in which you can play some of the more powerful dinosaurs is lower than the more squishy, but agile dinosaurs. There is a great balance on the field among dinosaurs. You get a lot of satisfaction using the special abilities that the dinosaurs possess. Being able to pick people up with a Pteranodon and carry them away is great, as well as leaping onto a human with a velociraptor. The abilities are really cool, and you'll definitely enjoy the variety in play styles.On the other side, the satisfaction comes from taking down the big dinosaurs with the humans. Concentrating your entire groups fire onto a T-Rex and finally bringing it down has a boss-battle type feeling. You get a lot of excitement out of trying to pick and choose your battles being the squishy humans. You get range on your side. For example, you can fire quite a few rounds off before a dinosaur can close on you, and you have to position yourself to make that happen in a lot of cases. Again though, the variety in play styles helps you to really find a good balance. The humans are really hard to beat as the dinosaurs, teamwork is a vital part of both sides.I would say that the gameplay and tempo closely resembles that of Left 4 Dead, and other teamwork based, arcade-type games. You get both 1st person as the Humans, and 3rd person with the Dinosaurs, which adds a bit of variety to gameplay. A big perk is the awesome variety of skins. There are some sick dinosaur skins that you can purchase for very cheap.Some things that really detract from the experience are the startling lack of servers. Not enough people play this game, there are only a few really active servers to choose from with good pings. That can cause problems. The game can come off as a little buggy in some situations, but its hardly noticeable most of the time.To close, it's a very unique and fun game. In my opinion, it's a very fresh multiplayer experience with surprisingly balanced and interesting gameplay. It's a singularly satisfying experience for both factions. For an indy gaming company, they've done a very successful job at delivering a polished product for us all to enjoy.I would definitely recommend this game, and I really look forward to what the developers will do with their next installments."

(although sometimes it takes like 2-3 minutes for the auto-balance to force someone to switch teams)Balance balance: Classes seems fair enough* for me. (I won't go through each class, but) Each class is unique.As humans you do have to use a little more team-work, but then again, that's part of what makes the game thrilling -that you almost HAVE to work together to surviveModes: Team Deathmatch, Get to the Chopper (my favorite), and Capture the egg(?) (the last mode they added, kind of like king of the hill mixed with capture the flag -which I admit I haven't seen actually played)TL;DR= the game is fun.Sure, it doesn't have a progression system & it doesn't keep track of any stats, but it's an adrenaline rush of a game that promotes teamwork, and to this day I have yet to find a better game for FEELING LIKE A RAPTOR. :D(Oh, and it has steam achievements, so there's that, too)-------*some people say the Pyro's flamethrower and fire-bomb are both OP,  That may have some truth to it, but I think you need to have a class like that to deal with hordes of dinos in the same place. there are ways the dinos COULD deal with a pyro, so I don't see that big of a problem with him."

A good team can make your enemies scream in rage, and a bad team will lose the match for you, so it is very dependent on good players; however, the way the game is built (horrendously overpowered dinos - a good thing, mind you -, scattered spawn points, and just a lonely time on your own) mean that a team will naturally come together, and few things are more satisfying than the mighty, fearsome, invincible tyrannosaurus stomping on screen, only to be turned into a glorified roast turkey by a hail of bullets and flame. The two game modes, Deathmatch and Get to the Chopper, usually play out very quickly and easily. This is bad and good; it is an incredibly easy game to just jump into, but it's no Battlefield 4 tactically speaking. If you just want to shoot some dinos (or eat some humans) while having wicked, mindless fun, this game is definitely worth the buy."

,Recommended,215470,7974998,"Posted: 8 December, 2013",all,Thegriz617,"Let me tell you a story about growing up in the 90s. The thing now a days is zombies, zombies everywhere from the the slow lumbering corpses as seen in Romero's ""of the Dead"" series to kirkmans the walking dead, to the new and fast infected of franchises like left 4 dead and 28 days later; but in the 90s everything was about dinosaurs, classics like Stephen speilburgh's Jurassic park,  to Jim Henson dinosaurs,  every kid wanted one, every kid had thousands of their toys, and every kid screamed for more.Now that being said, there weren't any guides, or codes, or even rules to make a good dinosaur game. Sure we had a few classics like snes's Jurassic park, but those were well before my time, with my first console being the PSX. Now i'm glad to see that there is a few people with that mindset and these people grew into a game company called lukewarm, and they've made the best dinosaur game in history, ever, buy it. What are you waiting for click the buy button.  Fine, you wanna know why it's good? well here,If you've ever played with your gi joes and army men then made them fight dinosaurs, this makes that fantasy come true. In the game you can either play the action figure looking humans or the or the nicely monstrous looking dinosaurs.  On the human side you can pick five classes a la team fortress 2 a nimble female sniper, an action hero looking heavy, an Irish pyro, and a hunter that looks nothing like bob peck (the guy that gets eaten by a velociraptor right after saying ""clever girl"") from Jurassic park.  Each of these classes have unique game play with the gunner's heavy machine gun, pyros chainsaw flame-thrower, and snipers sniper that makes the game as a whole, totally worth the buy.Now to move on the the other end of the scale there are the dinosaurs that are a totally different brand of game play than the first person shooter style of the humans. The dinosaurs have more of a third person action aesthetic that gives their brand more of a left 4 deadish style glee hearing the scream of someone on the mic as i gnaw their face off as a velociraptor.  each dinosaur like a human, has a very distinct and abject set of traits that make each of them more unique class game-play. Like left 4 dead I've often found myself, and my co-horts in dinosaur related terror striking in precision letting the charger like carnosaur go in first, knock everyone on the ground to let the smaller velociraptors come in and pounce like hunters onto the straggling survivors of the attack.One of the things I've found shocking about this game is the graphics. Not the aesthetics, though we will get into that later, the sheer work that is put into this engine  the trees move, the winds whirl, the storms storm, the snoz berries snoz berry and everything just catches my eye. Now a lot of people who are used to big budget games will argue that this is no crisis and that they might spend their time elsewhere but for an indie game with their first release? HOLY♥♥♥♥♥♥this is amazing. i love this company and what they've done with this game is nothing short of breath taking.Another thing that I've found that bodes in this game's favor is its absolute beauty and great looking art style. The lush tropic greens are a much desired break from the tedious browns and war torn look of most games. A lot of the maps are cluttered in a neat way that makes for interesting paths and unique always for a raptor to find it's prey and to strike from any direction they choose. See, the clutter here is good unlike modern military shooters  because the clutter serves a function and has a means to an end. The unique shrubbery and tropical jungle gives even t-rexes a chance to pop out 3 feet in front of your face only giving you enough time to scream in horror before you're lunchAll in all, great graphics, great game play, great art style. Buy it, it's more than worth your money"

Problem?). This game has a cool premise, and a lot of different game modes and classes for both sides, and with balancing it could be great. Except that the gameplay itself really isn't that fun yet. You run around and hipfire in the unreal engine as a human, and you run around and use a crosshair to aim melee attacks as a dinosaur. I hope they don't plan on staying on this engine."

The main problem is the consistant lag featured in the game itself, which often makes it frustrating. Also the human team is far too weak, if they stick together then they have a chance of surviving yes, but most of the time that doesn't happen, and it doesn't help the dinosaurs are just far too strong, T-Rex has massive health and always does one-hit-kill, Raptor can ambush people and hold then in a death-lock move, Carnotaurus bashes people from their hiding spots, Dilophosaurus spits at people and blinds them and Pterasaur reveals the humans' location with their screech, though the humans have their share of special abilities, it just isn't enough. The class selection screen is also quite annoying, it should have a structure similiar to that of Team Fortress 2's team and class selection screens. Finally there is also the lack of a story to note, I had to read about Primal Carnage on Wikipedia just to find out how the Dinosaurs and Humans came to be fighting each other on that island. There are some pluses to this game too, the graphics are VERY good, I didn't expect the game to have such rich graphical detail. Also the simple idea behind it, Humans and Dinosaurs trapped on an island and have to fight each other for survival, is a great one and we need more games as such. Overall, my verdict is someone needs to pay Primal Carnage some real good attention and sort things out, once the problems are gone I'll change this review."

Trapper class counters all smaller dino classes which is just part of the bigger problem of classes not being balaneced. Humans have much more fluid movements, but aren't nearly as enjoyable to play. If I get stuck on the human side, I find myself just waiting for the match to end. Getting stuck on terrain is also a big issue. Graphics are extremely dated by 2012 standards and the textures are really unappealing, limited maps, and gamrmodes, soundtrack is dull, etc. etc. I'd say the biggest problem is that no one plays, but I really can't blame them. It's a bad game. I've honestly never even considered refunding a game before, but this one, I really wish I could. Please, don't buy it.

Its simple, addicting, and entertaining.The human teams feel like something out of an Alien vs Predator game, with the player never knowing if there's something leaping at him from behind, or scoping them out from above.  And there's always the general feel of hopelessness as you notice a T-Rex coming your way.The dinosaur teams are entertainingly diverse, with each one serving a purpose.  The Novraptors are entertaining, and feel like the general soldiers of the team, as they're fast, do a lot of damage, and in plenty.  However, flying with the pternadon is a chore with its semi-buggy flying mechanics, and not very rewarding unless you like being helpful to your team, or just enjoy picking people up to drop them from the skybox.  The dilophosaurus are a bit underwhelming as well, being extremely underplayed because their only skills are utility, with their blinding/poison abilities.  And good luck trying to snatch a T-Rex role, but goddamn does it look ♥♥♥♥ing fun.All in all, I'm extremely happy with the game, but I have no illusions that is anything but arcadey fun.  Its not deep, and probably won't snag a thousand hours by anything, but it is entertaining, and something to quickly pick up and play."

One of the best features is that you don't just play as the Humans you also Play as the dinosaurs which makes the game that much better. When your playing as a Human and you see a T-Rex or Spinosaurus coming running at you, you feel the sense of sheer size of The T-Rex and Spinosaurus and get scared sometimes. There are still many servers alot of them full of players. If you are a fan of dinosaurs and want to feel the intensity of what it was like to fight a dino or be one DO NOT HESITATE TO BUY THIS!!! $15 bucks is a very reasonable price and worth every penny of your money, you won't be dissapointed .

Especially when you're a human. This game is a multiplayer only PvP game(which is a shame because a campaign would be a nice addition). On one team, you control the humans who are capturing points in order to escape to the helicopter. On the other team you control dinosaurs where you try to stop the humans from escaping. Each class has unique weapons and abilities they can use to a certain advantage. You must use these and come up with tactics to use with those abilities and weapons. Plus, there is no extra weapons, so you won't be overpowered by someone else.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------8.5/10 It's a very good game.

How does that ever work out for the humans? One word: Flamethrower. The maps are designed to be disorienting, and they maybe succeeded in this too well. It takes more than a few sessions to know what the hell is going on. The controls also are a little different, and you may need to rebind them if you're used to other shooters, or MMO's. The most frustrating thing for me was the dinosaurs' movement. When you manage to snag the Carnotaur, the charging controls are awkward to manage alongside the movement keys. At least they were for me. All that being said, you get to play this game as a dinosaur! And it does feel as awesome as it should once you get the hang of the controls and the map.

76561198064029253,Not Recommended,215470,28220791,"Posted: 6 December, 2016",all,SoulViper19,"I first saw this game around the time it came out, but not on Steam. I had seen some guy on YouTube advertise this game and explain some of the things about it and how it would require some really strong system specs.Years later I finally bought the game, by thenPrimal Carnage Extinctionhad come out, and my first impressions of it were lackluster. Missing was the excitment and gone was the joy. It felt like the game was on a very loose ball-joint, one that turns too fast and isn't big enough to fit securely in its socket. It kind of rocks around and tries to stay in place only to tilt and annoy you in that miniscule unnessecary kind of way.that's how it feels to me.So to get down to it, this game is bassically Jurassic Park meets TF2, and as you might guess, the game is unbalanced, everyone will tell you that; you will actually see reviews that point this out because it is painfully true. The Dinosaurs will wreck you everytime, unless you can co-ordinate and work together, the humans could hold a decentDEFENSE!, humans who go on the offense last long enough before being swarmed by four Raptors and a Carno.The gameplay is great for both sides, I'm aware the balancing issue I broguht up has painted the gameplay in a negative light but that's just the way of the game. Gameplay-wise it's to be expected from a game like this. The human side has various classes to pick from; the Commando and Tracker classes standing out in my mind as heavy hitters, but don't take my word for it. The aim with the human team is to bassically survive, kill Dinosaurs, and depending on the game mode, hold the point and await evac (that gamemode usually comes special with a Spinosaurus.)Playing the Dinosaurs (which everyone seems to prefer, again, balancing) is unique. Roaring, depending on the Dino you are in control of, allows for some unique attributes to be contributed to your team (Pteranodon lets all Dino's see humans through walls, Rex and Spino grant damage boost, for example.) This faction hits hard and is almost always guarunteed to win. That doesn't nessecarily mean it's not fun.They do get stuck and are a hassle to control at time, it's also very easy to make a mistake and become a Fossile of you don't know what you're doing.Graphically it's nothing flashy likeOverwatchor cartoony likeTF2, it has its own style and look to it. It looks amazing on its highest settings and the textures on the Dinos stand out beautifully, the colors and patterns are like-wise gorgeous.DLC is nothing more than skins.Primal Carnage Extinction, from what I understand, is the closest to an actual DLC there is for this game, except it's an entirely different game entirely. if you want more variety to the looks of the Humans and Dinos (the Dinos favored immensly) it's alright.This game is fairly dead, most of the time. occasionally you will find a server packed with people to play against, unlikeExtinctionthis game is still primarily a versus game, from what I've heard, the""successor""has become more of a roleplay game, I should note that I ahven't played or touchedExtinction, nor am I likely to.Finally, it comes down to the truth of this game; it has long since been abandonded by the developers. Lukewarm Media apparently went bankrupt and thus responsibility for the development of this game was handed to Circle Five Studios and Pub Games, however, they chose to leave this game to Fossilize, while they worked on... need I say it..?Primal Carnage: Extinction.Although this review has been primarily mixed to negative. I will end it on a positive note by saying that; despite the games flaws, problems and development history, there is fun to be had with this game. Playing as the humans can be very unfair at times, but if you know what you're doing it can be fun to play almost as much as it is playing as the Dinosaurs. The community is almost non-existent and I'm sure Extinction does some things better with this game, butPrimal Carnageisstill enjoyable if you can ignore all of these issues, find a game, maybe get some friends together and have a blast.That being said, I don't reccomend it as much as I would have years ago.Don't get me wrong, this game was great when I saw people playing it back around 2011/2012, but now it's more of a shell with a very small community, small to my knowledge anyway. It's a shamePrimal Carnagecouldn't have flourished."

I still do think it's pretty and well designed, but there should be a way to lower the details to make it less frustrating to play for people with non-gaming oriented consoles.

I thumbs it up, and I think you should try it.However, there are some issues. Glitcheness is one of them; being a raptor can be annoying. The jump button only works every few seconds, you can't jump quite as often as a ratpr should. So naturally ... you fall down holes a lot.The other issue is balancing. This is a hilariously unbalanced game. There is just no fighting players playing as Tyrannosaurs, especially when there are three of them. Do not waste your ammo on them. They rarely die; they run if they get too close to death and go heal somewhere. This is a team game, you are playing to help your team win. Shoot the little ones. Group up where the Tyrannosaurs can't get you and shoot the smaller dinosaurs to get the kills.As a dinosaur player, do not bother being a Rex. I know it's awesome, and the only species anyone really cares about in this game, but when the player hides under a roof or in an alleyway, there's nothing you can do but pout your big dinosaur face off. Besides, everyone aggressively clicks their mouse over the Rex hoping to be it and the chances are you won't get to play as his/her lordship.My advice would be to be that guy.That guy that lets his teammates get what they want and instead plays strategically. Let the silly children play as a Rex and be the dinosaur that runs in and disrupts the enemy so that they flee cover and are left vulnerable to the one-hit killing Tyrannosaurs.I also advise playing as the Pathfinder as a human. Damage against the Rex is as abysmal as everything else but shooting a raptor head on and murdering it straight up with the shotgun is such a ""Booyah"" moment. XD Blinding them with the flares is also handy when a motherlovin Rex is stomping after you and you're screaming your face off, running for your little shotgunner life.If you've read this far, then good on you, and I hope you enjoy the game if you do indeed buy it."

But, please, do NOT buy this game, because the multiplayer has literally NEVER worked for me; I did everything: verify the integrity of the game cache, restart steam, delete local content, redownload it, etc.  Either something is wrong with my computer, or (I am certain that this is the answer) no one is playing online.  Furthermore, I checked the multiplayer servers every day for about a month and voila!  Nothing.  On the other hand, I did have a bit of fun playing by myself trying out the different characters on the different maps, which all had somewhat interesting characteristics, especially the hilariously bad voiceacting for the humans, but the game, as expected, got boring after that with no other real people to play with.  If you want a game that will satisfy your hunger for a dinosaur-related FPS, I'd suggest Dino D-Day.  Not sure how good Primal Carnage:  Extinction is either but I didn't buy it because of the lack of trust I feel for the developers.  Oh and I hope this game wins my custom Steam award ""The Multiplayer Never Worked"" lmao.  So yeah just get Dino D-Day."

If you buy this game. You will never hear the end of it. Its Dreadful. First you kill dinosaurs then you be a dinosaur and eat humans and its normally on the same map. Its just a small circle. Sure there is get to the chopper mode. But all that happens is the dinosaurs stand at the gates blocking your path in every way possible. the general game is horrible. Also to make matters worse out of the characters there are hardly any customisations or different weapon without a special colour on them. I would be better of playing pac man then this. I do not recommend this game. Neither should anyone else.

,Recommended,215470,19277499,"Posted: 25 November, 2015",all,RAIZO,"Easily the best dino-based multiplayer action game on Steam, bar none!  Though the game is a little buggy at times (personally I suffered many crashes and random server drops) what you'll find therein is more than worth the minor programming headaches you'll encounter.The graphics, including the animations for the dinos, are for the most part exceptional.  When paired with the sound design, namely the dino-based sounds, this all makes for a believable experience.  There's a good mix of dinos and just like the humans, these each have their own unique strengths and weaknesses but all share 1 thing in common - their roar.  Example: the T Rex has a ton of life (2000 HP) and can stomp on people and eat them, though it is somewhat difficult to control in tight spaces due to its size and its roar gives an adrenaline boost to nearby dinos which won't benefit you too much; the Novaraptor moves really fast, especially when sprinting, has a vertical leap that would make a professional basketball player jealous and slashes fairly quickly and when it roars it goes into a frenzy which will prevent it from jumping or sprinting for a time but will double its attack speed....)The same goes for the humans - the Trapper has two pistols that don't hold a lot of ammo but which deal massive damage when aimed properly + he has a net gun that can trap lesser dinos, allowing him to go in for a single hit melee kill with his knife (or he can just shoot it); the Scientist has a very powerful/low ammo rifle and a tranquilizer gun that causes disorientation and eventually death with enough shots; the pyro....well, he's a pyro w/ a flamethrower and  some grenades.Sadly, due to the developers stepping away from their project when they passed on the reains to another developer for the pseudo-sequel (Primal Carnage: Extinction) there were still some bugs left which will not be fixed (or so I heard) and there is no single player mode, so pick up a copy and play this game while you can.  Currently, there are only ever about 60 peeps playing at any given time and it probably won't be too much longer before this game dies all together.  It will be a sad day indeed when that occurs but I'm glad to have had this expereience while it lasted.Again, get it while you can - it's pretty cheap even without a sale : )"

There is no real warning aside of earthquake that would let you know of a incomming large dino.The humans are also very under developed.I see no proper use for the scientists weapons to snipe anything when the place is overcrowded with dinos that instant kill her. Her ability to drain stamina is also a pretty dum idea because the dinos can still easy kill ppl.The commando is lacking mobility with the grenades and wont respond shooting them when needed but at least they all have a neat long time to reload... If they want to imput reality in this game then they should had start with the dinos before deciding to give humans too many reload penalties.While dinos can just spam attacks with a fast regenerating stamina, humans must constantly reload and collect ammo if they live long enough for that.I feel like the level designs are poorly made and should give humans more advantage like, operating doors, activate mechanical traps or even use vehicles but instead they are just put there to become instant snack. They dont even get areas that would be unacessable for large dinos aside of the rooftop but even there a t-rex can glitch its head to bite one off.Even cooperating in a large group has no use as any large dino can trample and kill them in instant.The characters and level design is greatly unbalanced in dinos favor.If you are a huge dino fan who likes making easy kills, its a game for you but playing as human it is nothing but punishment with no real experience that id call positive.The game is very unbalanced, unfinished and bugged. Not worth the buy..."

It is an impressive game for the price, and I absolutely love the feel of this game: basically survive Jurassic Park, lol. The core game is great, and the interactions between human and dinosaurs can lead to some dramatic one-on-one moments. During my first play-through as a human, running along alone, my screen began to shake, thumping with the rythmic beating of ever-closer foot falls. I quickly ducked into a side alley, turning in time to see the leg of a Tyrannosaurus, another live player, running past. After a moment it returned, roaring and thrashing, trying to reach me at the back of the alcove. My gun rang out shot after show along with my screams of equal terror and delight. The beast retreated, returned at an angle anew. My gun clicked out of ammo just as the great reptile's head burst deep into the alcove, pulling me screaming out into the light where it finished me off with one swift gulp. Simply awesome. Its one of those games where you can really find yourself immersed in the action...or sometimes, lack there of. I spawned during one playthrough, again as a human, deep in the dense woods, far from my other team members. As I treked aimlessly through the for forest in search of someone, anyone, my mind raced with thoughts of what foul things may be stalking me from behind or even above. It's moments like this that make this game great. It is not without its flaws however, including some rendering issues from time to time and other assorted bugs, but overall, I am well pleased and would whole-heartedly recommend it."

76561198026662084,Recommended,215470,18608095,"Posted: 21 October, 2015",all,InDIGnation,"Even with the much-derided 1.3 patch, Primal Carnage is still a solid and straightforward asymmetrical multiplayer game that's well worth the low price of admission.The Game...Primal Carnage is split between two separate styles of play: the human team is controlled from a first-person perspective with a focus on shooting and technology; the other team controls dinosaurs in third-person whose attacks center around stealth, ambushing and conspicuous amounts of slashing and biting. You'd think such a setup would compromise one or the other, but that's not the case, for the most part.As with many multiplayer games, Primal utilizes a class system, each character with their own unique abilities and attacks. Somewhat like Team Fortress 2, if less symmetrical. On the human team, a fair bit of effort is given to make each class feel interesting and different. Weapons include conventional guns like pistols, shotguns and rifles, but the game mixes it up with interesting special equipment such as nets, tranq darts, flares and flamethrowers. The gunplay itself is rather loose and doesn't feel up to the high standards set by other multiplayer games. Nevertheless, the variety in the weapons makes playing as the humans an interesting gameplay experience, particularly when alone...Of course, the selling point here is the dinosaurs, how do they control? Like the human team, there are five classes of various shapes and sizes, each with a primary (usually bite) and (usually) secondary attack. They also each have a special roar ability, which gives them temporary boosts and abilities such as faster attacks, health boosts and enemy spotting. Also like the humans, they all feel unique and generally fun to play as, thanks in no small part to the rather ludicrous ragdoll system which turns dead characters into orbiting devices. Movement with the larger lads can feel cumbersome, but you soon learn to adapt to the control differences between the classes. The best moments, of course, are those that involve waiting and stalking lone human players as they bumble about the forest until waiting for the correct moment to strike. A large chunk of the game is spent at the centre of incomprehensible carnage, but these moments of cat-and-mouse are no doubt where the game truly shines, creating moments of tension for both playersHowever, there are a couple of mechanical problems that bear worth mentioning here. Due to changes made in the 1.3 patch, the Novaraptor class's secondary ability, the pounce, was left in a somewhat buggy state. It seems to be a sporadic issue, but sometimes attempting to leap on an unsuspecting pleb from the bushes can instead launch you halfway across the map. It's not a game-breaking issue, but it can be rather frustrating. Aside from this, glitches are common. Most are minor and simply involve visual quirks, like humans lying on the ground screaming in terror at a raptor that ripping them apart from twenty feet away, presumably with some kind of prehistoric telekinesis. However, game crashes do occur. I haven't suffered from too many of them, but they are present.Aside from that, the game runs fairly well even on lower-end systems. It's not the best-looking game in the world, but the modelling and environmental work is still pretty good for an indie game that's now hitting its third year. Some maps are more taxing though, tanking the framerate even on my GTX 770 when the visuals get busy. Again, not a big problem, but worth noting.FutureOne last important thing everyone should bear in mind before purchasing this game. Due to complicated behind-the-scenes happenings, this game is no longer being updated. Instead, the new developers have released the long-awaited 2.0 update as a separate game titled ""Primal Carnage: Extinction"". I cannot comment on the state of this game as I have not played it yet. If you do commit to the original Primal Carnage, be mindful that it will likely never see another update. In my estimation, the game is stable enough to not warrant any concerns in the near future.At the moment, the population is still pretty reasonable. Servers can get quiet at some times during the day, but there are plenty of players milling about online in the evenings.ConclusionIf you're into dinosaur games or mindless corny action, then Primal Carnage has got you covered: it's a bone-crunchingly good time once you get a handle on it and never gets old. It ain't the deepest or most expansive dinosaur game out there, but it's still a darned fine one. If you see it on sale, then it's an absolute steal!Good hunting."

,Recommended,215470,14630817,"Posted: 23 February, 2015",all,PayShayCarl,"This game is like everything that Orion could have been, but there are things that could be improved.Starting off, this game has a menu on the left of the boot-screen that could be unitilized with the options being on the right, instead of removing the menu and taking up the middle of the screen.The second thing is that the gameplay on the Dinosuar's could have been improved a bit more with the T-Rex's being more mobile in their movements and with more variety to their attacks, maybe randomizing their attack every time you press left button on the mouse, and there is no menu option that I can find to change the speed of my mouse and that is not something player's should be locked into having be uncontrollable by them.The skin's in the game are really good but there isn't much variety to the class skins.Lastly the menu's in general were just poorly designed and poorly executed with the clunky scrolling, hard to click buttons, confusing menu's and hard to look at menu designs.Overall this game is really good but some updates in the future would be very much appreciated, to make this game worth every penny.This game is overall worth the price of 8 dollars or a sale price, but the DLC is not and for this game to receive a 10/10 or 9/10 it would need to at leat fix the problems I have pointed out.6/10"

Primal Carnage Extinction is available now as a separate game.  There will be no updates to this product and it should not even be for sale.  It has been abondoned by the original team and the new team is developing PCE so don't bother with PC.-------------------------------------The game has issues but it is VERY fun despite the problems.  The devs are also working on a total recode to fix the current issues and expand the game with more of everything.Playing as a dino in third person view is exciting and rewarding.  Working in small packs hunting humans is very enjoyable.  Stalking a good human player and finally taking them out is a real rush.Playing as a human in first person view is also a great deal of fun.  Playing as a human you feel weak and vulnerable so your level of paranoia is always high.  Stick with other players and work as a team to defend and take down the fast and powerful dinos.Every class is very playable and has its own advantages and disadvantages making the game a different experience for each class.  Some are utility classes, some are damage dealing but all can be lethal.  It shouldn't be difficult to find a class to suit your preferred play style."

Something is catching up to you. You try to dodge between the trees, the ground shakes even more as an ear-splitting roar sounds just behind you. You turn around and bring up your rifle just as a gigantic head swings down and crushes you in its jaws.You have just been T-Rex'ed. Next turn you'll get to chase the humans down. Welcome to Primal Carnage!Pro:*Awesome setting, dinosaurs and humans always makes for good fun. The screams, the adrenaline...*Both sides are playable.*Active development.*Good graphics (not everyone agrees on this apparently. Well, I like it at least)*The best organised team tends to win...mostly (see below)Con:*The most clunky fix to an (supposedly) overpowered class ever; the Pyro now slows to a crawl when he fires his weapon.*Given two equally matched teams, the dino's tend to win. As the teams alternate constantly, this is not too much of a problem, and a good human team will win against the dino's without much trouble.Pro or Con, depending on your views:*The T-Rex will flatten any human team that fails to work together.*The playerbase is not nearly as large as the game deserves.Summary:A FPS / TPS game that features dinosaurs and humans. Carnage ensues, much fun is had despite some imbalances and the worst ""OP Class""-fix in history. 7/10 -Recomended.For more recomendations and reviews:http://steamcommunity.com/groups/strandedkerbonaut#curation"

Sembrava un bel gioco ma gli sviluppatori hanno avuto la bella idea di lasciarlo pieno zeppo di bug e classi nerfate oltre ogni limite. Puntate al seguito: ""Primal Carnage: Extiction"" (che doveva essere un'update GRATUITA del gioco), se volete un bel gioco sui Dinosauri.. Mentre ai tempi che furono era un gran gioco, ora non è altro che la beta di Exctiction.Don't buy it. It seemed that the devs had decided to give up on it, and there is no reasons to buy it. While it used to be a good game, now this is just a beta of  the new ""Primal Carnage: Extiction"". So, if you want a good Dinosaurs game, buy the new title, ""Primal Carnage: Extiction"", which will be soon aviable for pre-order."

I find that kinda crappy.   Maybe get the other one if it goes on sale or something, but I'm gonna pass for a while because that trick annoyed the hell out me.Look at all of the positive reviews and you may notice that it was before Primal Carnage Extinction was announced.Old Review:Great fun for a Indie game!I grew up with games like Turok and this reminds me quite a bit of a multiplayer spinoff of it.  Its a little buggy but great fun all the same.  Teamwork and learning the in's and outs of your class are essential to victory in this fast paced deathmatch of Dino's vs Humans."
76561198006802457,Not Recommended,215470,14012320,"Posted: 16 January, 2015",all,Princess Inkbutt,"I want to reccomend this game.  Really I do.Class based Dino vs Human,  it's exactly what you think it's like. But a few things get in the way.BIGGEST ISSUE = Primal Carnage Extinction.    Goggle it,  check it out, it's on Steam as an eary access game. What is it?  This game,  it's quite literally this exact game, avaiable  I'm not telling you to go buy it however,  I don't own it.  But it's the same game.   Unless they release it as a free update (they aren't)  then there's literally no sense in buying this game.   That's just one thing though, and isn't fair to this game as it is, so I'll go a little deeper.The game is actually a little fun. Humans are, what you tink they'd be.  It's a standard FPS sorta thing with your generic classes  DPS, Sniper, average, alpha, utlity, etc.  What more do you want, these guys weren't straying too far outside the box here.   You're not here to play as people.  If you are,  why are you playing this game?Shooting dinosaurs has been around since Toruk (yes it's older, don't care)  and you can literally play oodles of any other soot dinosaurs games.   Yes, even freaking Orion Prelude.Dinosaurs are indeed unique.   You do dinosaur things unless you want to play the T-rex,  because those are hard capped and you're never there early enough to do it.  Why?BIGGEST ISSUE NUMBER TWO = Low Server population.   -  Again, this isn't a fault of the games design, and the aforementioend PC: Extinction probably has a lot to do with this. But simple enough,  even if you enjoy the gameplay,  there really aren't many matches.  Sometimes only 2 active servers depending which time you play.  1AM - 5AM in America? Forget it.   Suppose that's punishing Australians as well.Once you have gotten a few matches, and mastered flying the Pteranodon,  it really just shows how little there is.  ""Get to the Chopper"" game mode is sorta fun for a bit, but that's about it.   The routine of ""same"" starts to sink in really really fast.  Once you finally get to a T-Rex,  they really aren't even that great.   We've already been over humans.Maps themselves are all accessable to dinos,  so there's not many sneaky spots for snipers to get around to. Almost everything is ground level, why?  Because humans can't jump.  The dinosaurs can literally reach the top of shipping crates, or fly around. Humans?  NOPE.   No doors to push open, ladders to climb, or cars to get into. Playing human realyl sucks. There's a few areas safe from T-Rex, but that's about it, nearly everywhere else you can get targeted.So.....that's why no.You can just do better.   Seriously, TF2 is free to play  and I can understand it's not everybodies stchick, but if you're in it for the experience you can't argue with free.Want a meele based  game?  Chivalry Medieval Warfare is not but a few clicks away.The concept is great,  and I wish this game were just a little better so I could spend more time playing it, but it simply isn't.   That bein said, it probably is the best of this Genera. (Orion Prelude, and Dino D-Day being the major competition), so if you want to poddle around as a dinosaur for a little bit and it's on sale,  then I guess give it a go.  But, for the next game to wear your keyboard out on,  you can do better."

Real energy and effort was put into this game to make playing as a dino feel satisfying and entertaining.And for those who need more than just Dinosaurs to be easily persuaded, the class-based PVP Combat is amusing and strays away from the more expected formulas. Tranq guns, net launchers, and carrying away humans as Pterodactyls isn't common FPS fodder.Give it a shot; certainly not an expensive investment and YOU GET TO RUN AROUND AS DINOSAURS."

,Recommended,215470,7802899,"Posted: 28 November, 2013",all,ToxiGhost,Fun shooter featuring player vs player combat where one team plays as the dino's and the other as the humans. There's a good selection of both human classes and dinosaurs to play and the online servers are always populated as far as i've seen. The game itself has little to no long term depth in the way of character customization/advancement and so it purely offers a fun way to burn time shooting dinos and eating humans which it does very well. Overall pretty fun for a while and i'd recommend it to casual gamers that are looking for an exciting and fun shooter to play.

,Recommended,215470,7823071,"Posted: 29 November, 2013",all,Borsig,"Probably the only dinosaur game worth playing, I think it's similar to chivalry/team fortress in the way it's an easy FPS to get into but without any grind, and it has a class based system, split between two sides so you know what to kill. I think dinosaurs have more complicated characters, but have a T-Rex on their side which is ultimately better than everything at getting kills and lasting the longest. It is worth playing with friends, and I didn't experience any bad bugs this time around. The only downside is the lack of complexity later on and graphical fidelity; it's easy to max out and it has an FOV slider."

The Dino's don't know where you are all the time, so if you're patient you can get em without them even realising until it's too late.

Though there is as of yet no customisation of classes, their individual abilities create an incredibly fun arena that emphasises the importance of teamwork. You won't survive this carnage alone. A lone human can easily be pounced upon by a raptor, carried away by a swooping pteranodon, or blinded by a dilophosaurus' toxic spit. And of course, the quaking of the screen and the cacophonous roar of a T-Rex on your trail is an utterly terrifying experience. On the other side of the game, dinosaurs must fear the paralysing net of the trapper and the blinding flares of the tracker, along with all the other heavy firepower humanity brings to bear, using ambush and co-ordination to get in close and feed their unending hunger. The game remains fairly well balanced, with games won with teamwork rather than lone commandos choosing one particular overpowered class.In terms of graphics, the game is a stunning product for an indie game. Even if your computer is less than stellar, the game runs well on low graphics, and you can still enjoy the incredible animations of the dinosaur character models, truly bringing the exinct beasts back to life in an amazing fashion.And whilst you may scoff at the number of different DLC dino skins, when you remember that you control them in the third person, suddenly you may find yourself a little more interested in customising your reptilian killer.With constant updates coming from the brilliant dev team, I'd say Primal Carnage is only lacking one thing; you!"

You can feel the terror as you sprint for cover with the rumble of a T-rex quickly aproaching your vulnerable behind! They are no joke but the game is still well balanced as there are many places to hide but needing ammo and health keeps you moving between areas giving them a chance to eat cha!...  of course humans also have the advantage of range. Just don't get busted being a straggler! You might just find yourself getting jumped by a raptor!The dinos also have plenty of veriety with each one having it's own style of ""primal carnage"". ;PT-rexes are slow and can't fit everywhere but have a lot of health and can not only eat you in one chomp but trample you to death as well...STAY CLEAR!Raptors Are probably my favorite to play because they're made for hunting!You can crouch in a bush out of site in till someone walks by, jump them, and thrash them while they're stuck screaming in agony under your feet! badasssss!They're also really fast and great jumpers.The other dinos are fun too in different ways but that's all I'll say here.Basically I don't get why people don't like this game I think it's freakin awesome!... it's like Jurassic Park the game!The servers can be a little light but I consistantly find a server with at least 13 people which considering the chaos of the game still works out pretty well in my opinion.

Ultimately Extinction increased dramatically in scope and at this point the project is far over budget. We can’t survive and pay our staff without charging something for Extinction. Customers who purchased the original Primal Carnage before November 20th, 2014, will receive a coupon for 85% off of Extinction’s $20 launch price which will bring the cost of Extinction to $3 for customers who bought the original Primal Carnage. While we do apologize that we couldn’t release this game for free, we’ve made a decision that better supports our ability to deliver ongoing content to the game and in turn delivers more to our community in the long term. A lot of people have devoted a lot of time to building this game, and we fully stand by its value.So yeah... Take that how you will.

From it's fantastic graphics, enviromental level design, textures and modelling of the dinosaurs, it is a great game! It's mostly a team deathmatch with Humans v.s. Dinosaurs as I heard that the game does not have so many modes, so if you are thinking of purchasing this game, be warned that the game does not include many modes. But if you want a perfect killing deatmatch dinosaur game, forget Dino D-Day or even ORION: Dino Beatdown and get Primal Carnage, its the better out of all the dinosaur games I know of, a great game to enjoy with yourself and your friends. With all its tense moments, great modelling of dinosaurs and great gameplay, its a great game to have in your Steam library!RECOMMENDED :)Oh, and on a personal note to the developers (Lukewarm Media or whoever owns this game) please change the fonts on the main menu as they look awful and very out of place, and if your thought Arial Font was a good font choice, think again, it looks very out of place and disgusting.

,Not Recommended,215470,4319165,"Posted: 3 November, 2012",all,Gentlefish,"EDIT: At some point during the time I forgot about this game they released an update that threw balance out the window and broke a lot of stuff. They also made a separate game out of the promised overhaul (which, with my current understanding of the situation, I don't really fault them for)... though current owners get a major discount on it. So uh... this review isn't entirely accurate anymore, and I would advise you to wait for Primal Carnage: Extinction, which with any luck will be everything you ever wanted. The Extinction raptor's pounce attack is not the 1.3 raptor's pounce attack, so that's already really great, from what I've been hearing.------Primal Carnage is a great game. While it may look like one side or the other has the upper hand, they're actually on equal footing, and any imbalance is the fault of the players. I've seen humans gobbled wholesale just as often as Tyrannosaurs sent flying by grenades and silly physics.Unfortunately, the game is a bit of a memory hog, and there isn't any in-game voice chat. However, the rest of the game more than makes up for these drawbacks. Players may pin down and shred a human while playing the Novaraptor - Primal Carnage's signature dromaeosaurid - or take down a T-Rex with flares and a shotgun as the Pathfinder. Finishing the roster are the Pyromaniac, Commando, Trapper and Scientist on the human team and the Carnotaurus, Dilophosaurus and Pteranodon on the dinosaur team. Also available for purchase are functionally-identical dinosaur swaps such as the Oviraptor, a beaky alternative to the Novaraptor. You'll also see Spinosaurus filling in for the Rex on Get to the Chopper, one of the available gamemodes.So, all in all, Primal Carnage is absolutely amazing, and I recommend it for all dinosaur fans and any looking for a unique FPS."

The graphics are pretty good and the dinosaurs look fantastic. Each dino is animated very well and sound like something straight out of Jurassic Park. Most other sounds in the game are fairly accurate and punchy like they should be. Occasionally, you'll find a texture here and there that isn't up to snuff with the rest of the environment and the water can look bland here and there.As for the game, think Team Fortress 2 with dinosaurs. Balance between classes and species is decent for the time being. The raptors can feel a bit overly fast at times when playing as a human and when there are multiple T-rexes, things can get a bit hectic. Overall though, you'll rarely notice these problems as the player base seems dedicated to playing the game right. My only other complain is that (save for achievements) there isn't much to do in the game other than fight. For the time you play it though, there certainly more than enough entertainment for the money. I definitely recommend this one for anyone needing something new."

All the people here are just madcuzbad.I read things like ''once a dinosaur is near you your pretty sure dead'', which is abolutely not true. A Rex, for example, is not manouverable, so you can just jump to the sides and try to outrun them at edges. Raptors are quick but if you focus you'll get them quite easily, same with pterodactyls and the spitting dudes. The dinos with the horns (Carnotaurus? Allosaurus? idk man) are also avoidable with the same tactic as with  the rex. The problem is that people come here expecting a CoD with dinosaurs, but that's not what this is. Of course if you camp on a rock or walk out alone you're going to die, there's literally carnivourus dinosaurs out there you idiot. All the dinos have special abilities activated by them roaring and rex can tilt it's head up and down to get enemies above them and on the ground. The survivors are definetely not in a disadvantage, you just have to stay in packs and you will have the upper hand. a couple of pathfinders, trappers and some black, brollic machine guy dudes and you can easily take down a rex.Considering this, anyone that has given a bad review should definetely give it another shot, just don't expect a CoD or a Battlefield, this is Primal Carnage."

Really?)The Verdict:This game has something. Like a flash in the pan really. A spark of awesome. I bought it awhile ago thinking I would get some good playtime with it but soon after moved onto different things. The game looked like it had promise but then the devs released the sequal (a v1.5 really) and this game was kind of left to die. For those reasons I can not recommend this game. It's not 100% dead, but damn if it is not on death's door."

Certainly, things seem weighted in the dinosaur's favor and I'm always left wanting to change sides on those occasions which I am shunted onto the human team, but the gameplay is still fun enough that I'm usually fine with just playing out the match on the human side to get shuffled back in the next round. There are occasional glitchy issues and lag spikes, but overall for what it is, a very enjoyable game."

It is overall really simple but it has a lot of content for a game as cheap as 8 £ in my case of course do the math ya self if you want the price in dollars anyways playing this is really fun overall and it is satisfying to crunch down some tasty humans or gun down a rex :D (I have a probem myself with the game but unlike most people i dont blame the game since most people dont have this problem, anyways my problem is that when i click start my PC automatically cancels the quick startup or something and i do think it has something to do with unreal engine since i have a game called Orion Prelude which does just the same thing and they both use unreal engine. Its a very annoying problem because i havent played Primal Carnage for a year because of this and i would ask if anyone here knew what to do?) So yeah thats what i got to say... You can vote this unhelpfull if you think i lack information or whatever... :)"

I've almost played 80 hours of this game and have no regrets. (except for goddamn ragequitting when I got kicked from a roleplay server for not changing my skin, that sucked.) Anyway you should get this game while it's on sale for about 2 bucks, because currently that's about all it's worth due to the bugs and glitches."

,Recommended,215470,35249915,Posted: 27 September,all,Starwarzia,"So this game is ultimtley fun. Devs moved on to a sequel so no updates, but it is stable for the most part (besides a few UI glitches), however most servers have gone down so only 6 remain at the time of this writing: 1 Get to the Chopper server, 1 RP server and 4 deathmatches (Rex Rampage, Isla Sorna, Docks 24/7 and Spino+Compy Mod). Playerbase is relativley small, only 20-30 people on at peak hours on the weekends and 10-15 during the week. Deathmatch gameplay consists of choosing a team, Humans or Dinosaurs, and then murdering the other team for 40 minutes, while Get to the Chopper is a base defense game. Both are fun, so if you're okay with a small group of players and like shooters and/or dinosaurs, this is a game I would recommend."
