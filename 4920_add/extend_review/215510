,Not Recommended,215510,18405862,"Posted: 9 October, 2015",all,genoforprez,"This is an excellent game for the right kind of person, maybe, but I am personally not feeling it. The thing I love most about Rocketbirds is its art. It LOOKS amazing. I love everything about not only the quality of the art, but the cartoony style. I also love the theme of chickens vs penguins. In a game culture where so many things are grimdark or the same old human space marines shooting the same old badguy marines and/or aliens and/or zombies, there is something refreshing about a change of wallpaper. And what great-looking wallpaper it is.I also was interested in Rocketbirds because it looked like it had some action akin to a metroidvania or possibly something a little bit more contra style. I typically enjoy those types of games, so it seemed like a safe buy. But ultimately Rocketbirds just didn't satisfy me. Here are the turnoffs:1) Movement feels sluggish and stiff, like driving a tank that also has to peel itself off the linoleum every time it stops and starts again.2) Shooting is incredibly simple. You can either shoot straight ahead or you can crouch and shoot straight ahead. That's it. You can't change aim direction while shooting, though, and HB controls and moves slow. So one of this game's favorite things to do is have 2 to 4 penguins come running in from both sides of the screen and attack you from both sides. If you only shoot one way, you'll get shot in the back. Ostensibly what you want to do is quickly shoot back and forth to keep enemies on both sides staggered. However, if you are shooting right and want to shoot left, you have to release the trigger, turn HB around, then start shooting again. Since HB also controls/moves very slowly, this makes it very easy to get ganked in the most frustrating way.3) The platforming feels very bad. The jumps are sluggish as the rest of HB's movements, for starters, but the other weird thing is that HB will auto-grab any ledges he jumps toward---and he will do it at a fairly far distance. This is great if you are actually trying to get up on that ledge, but if you don't want to auto-grab that ledge, then having him auto-grab it is annoying. The same goes for dropping over the edge of a ledge or precipice. If you are standing on an edge and press down, HB will automatically climb down that ledge. This is annoying in situations where you climb up onto a ledge, then an enemy runs on screen, and what you WANT to do is press down to crouch and shoot, but instead HB crawls down the ledge. Sigh.4) Trying to line HB up with a buttons and switches can be awkward due to jerky movements. Likewise, there are also lots of light puzzles involving pushing crates around, but pushing the crates also feels awkward due to jerky movements. This is the ""sticky"" aspect of controlling HB. Because while on one hand he feels sluggish, he is also difficult when trying to make more fine/precise movements, because his movement/animation tends to ""pop"". When pushing crates, they don't just slide across the floor in a smooth, consistent motion. They jerk and lurch forward as you push them. When trying to make fine movements, such as to line HB up with a button, he will jerk to the left and right of the button.5) There are different guns in the game, but it largely doesn't matter which gun you use. They all pretty much control the same, and for the vast majority of enemy encounters, one gun does not provide any advantage over another gun. There are power differences and rate of fire differences, but due to the way the combat works, it doesn't really change your tactics in any significant way.6) You can use mind control on the penguin enemies to take over their minds and make them go shoot their friends, but they control exactly the same as HB (except in the rare case where you can mind control a bazooka penguins), so the gameplay doesn't feel different. This still makes for good puzzling, however.I got frustrated once I got to one of the ships where you had to flip the self-destruct button and escape the ship in time. (Time challenges. Always thrilling.) I was struggling with the controls but eeking by up until that point, but at that point it was just asking for more than I was willing to fight the controls for.Final Verdict: A beautiful looking game with a great heart, but the controls just don't feel very good, which brings the rest of the experience down."
,Not Recommended,215510,10214607,"Posted: 23 May, 2014",all,YellowLab,"This is a short, run and gun platform game. Even at three hours, it overstays its welcome. The levels are all the same - climb around some buildings, press switches to call the elevators, oops can't go that way, must brainbug an enemy to press a button or something, go grab that crate, run back to where you were, finish the level, oh wait another building except this one is in the jungle instead of on an ice mountain. There are some occasional flying dog fight missions to break it up, but by the end (well much before that) I was ready for the game to be over (make it stop). The end is certainly anticlimactic since the main boss fight isn't even the main boss.There are some collectables - red signs you must hit. However, there is only one in a level at a time. Once you hit one, another will show up. Usually, in a place where you have already gone. Backtrack some more for the fun of it? Yeah, I don't think so."

The fact that its linux compatible and full controller support is great. Runs very well on ubuntu with a wired usb 360 controller. It isnt super short either. So you do get plently of game play hours out of it. Overall the game storyboard is well thought out and put together. It is a bit violent but kids over 8-10 should be fine playing. But use your own judgement. Every child is different. This game has not disappointed. I would recommend it at 9.99 but when on sale its a steal of a deal. I hope this helps anyone on the fence about getting it.

While the gameplay could have been much more and length is quite short, this game is remembered for its soundtrack, humour and artstyle, and it is proof that even very simplistic stories can be made intriguing thanks to this great combo.+ Presentation: a war between chickens and penguins. The artstyle mixes cartoon-y and serious atmosphere, with clean graphics and detailed environments.+ Great soundtrack, consisting of ""Science Fiction Rock"" music by New World Revolution+ Decent level design, with varying action sequences and puzzles+ Humour+ Local and network co-op mode- Clunky controls- You can only aim and shoot left and right. There's also a cover system (such as crouching behind crates and hiding in the dark), but sadly, it can rarely be used- Even though it's a separate story, co-op mode features the same maps from the singleplayer story and it is quite short- No music during the final boss fight"

My Xbox 360 controller worked on the menu, but input failed to register once I entered the game. I won't make it that big of a deal, however, since I'm fine with keyboard and mouse. The gameplay itself is much more of a cause for worry.The fist thing you notice is that jumping is stiff, like the infamous Castlevania jump: you can't change direction in midair. There's also a painfully slow windup time and hang time for each jump, making platforming a pain and breaking the flow of transitioning from run to jump. You can grab onto ledges and pull yourself up, which would be kinda cool if the game didn't completely depend on this SINGLE MECHANIC for 100% of platforming from start to finish. Every time I jump or pull myself up I sigh at how slow it takes. But hey, you might wonder, isn't the game also focused on combat? That should be a nice refresher. Well, guess again.Rocketbirds has a ridiculously shallow form of combat. You shoot directly forward, or you crouch and shoot directly forward. You can't change direction while shooting, so you have to stop shooting and turn around if enemies appear on either side of you. The different weapons seem to be there simply for necessity rather than variety, because the only difference between weapons is the amount of time it takes to kill the enemy. You can throw grenades, but it breaks the flow of the game with its clunky behavior and no way to tell where exactly your mouse is aiming so that you can affect the projected trajectory. There's also the ability to take temporary control of an enemy instead of Hardboiled Chicken, but that feature is COMPLETELY POINTLESS because gameplay doesn't really change at all.There are cutscenes, but they're awful, especially the voice acting. The game also tries to be kinda funny, but I had to double take to make sure that certain lines were ridiculously pathetic attempts at humor. Anything I actually like about this game? Well, the artstyle isn't too bad; I kinda like it. There's also a section early in the game that works like a 2D dogfight minigame which I definitely enjoyed, but the rest of the game is just boring, even painful, to play.TL;DR:Rocketbirds brings nothing new to the action platformer, while also managing to ruin the basics of the genre."

There was never a puzzle that got me stuck, which is very uncommon and I have to salute the makers of this game for the good job.Just like all the good old games, this game has a cheesy storyline to follow(in a good way) except this is a ""real"" storyline that actually makes sense unlike the old platformers.Controls are simple and easy to use and there's no special tricks trying to control your character which makes it easy to just start playing. The Game worked flawlessy with linux as well. The only annoying thing was that switching the weapons with a mouse wheel was sometimes a bit of a pain, especially in tight situations where you are surrounded.

The game itself is a side-scrolling shooter but there is a lot of emphasis on top notch animations, which don't necessarily spell better gameplay. Because there are a lot of animation frames dedicated to each action, the controls can seem cumbersome and unresponsive in a genre like a shooter.The game also throws in some bullet hell sequences which are very exciting to play through. Probably the most exciting parts of the entire game.BUT the game itself is pretty forgiving (on normal difficulty anyway) so it's nothing game breaking.

Being patient is really the only way to play this game, impulse is not rewarded which feels bad for a no-holds-barred gunner.

If you are intrigued by the visuals or music, you will most likely gloss over gameplay problems just to see what crazy stuff will happen next.OVERALL:Rocketbirds strikes me as a marriage between Abe's Oddysee and Metal Slug.

While it is indeed similar, the graphic content of the game actually surprised and offput me a bit, and after awhile felt it was way over done just for the sake of being gory or graphic.  Characters are pretty stereotyped, though the animated cutscenes are well done, as is the voice acting.  The dialogue though is really stale for the main cast I felt, though the penguin henchmen you run into had much more amusing dialogue.GraphicsThe sprites themselves are very well animated (minus sliding boxes around), and the environments are detailed and lush.  The problem is the lack of variety, as you'll either be in a military base, blimp, or forest with the same similar backdrops and details minus a few neat areas that I wish were more prevelant.  Enemy types are also for the most part the same with different colored uniforms.  There are a few different enemy types but you really don't run into them long enough to notice, or they are a boss of sorts and are a one off sadly.ControlsThe keyboard personally had a bit of a wonky control layout, but much more response while the controller (which you need to manually go into the options to enable) had better key layout but a weird sluggish feeling to it.  Also rocket levels are a nightmare on keyboard but much more smooth on controller.GameplayI have no clue how some of these mechanics were deemed okay and sent off to the final product.  Maybe I had extremely bad luck in the game, maybe the game just hates me, but beating this game is a bit like gambling.  You can count your cards, do all the math in your head in probability but it still falls down to that 5% chance that the game will have everything against you.  You cannot aim your gun.  You can only shoot left or right, crouch/roll jump and switch weapons.  Later you get neat little things called brainbugs to control your opponent and grenades but god help you if you even think of using anything other then your machine gun in combat.  Rolling does nothing to dodge incomming fire, and the only way to not be juggled around for 5 seconds being shot at is to pray the level designers put a crate (which they never do minus two or three times) or some sort of thing to hide in.  Or just shoot before they do unless luck decides it says no.  You will be put into near impossible situations such as having two enemies on either side of you with no cover, and friendly enemy fire doesn't exist, yet you can kill a penguin, juggle it's body while another penguin camps behind it and shoots through his friend's corpse and at you.  Walking into the next part can also result in death due to them open firing before you can even have the camera slide fully over into what's even killing you and can only hope the enemy is looking the other way when this occurs.  The puzzle element is more aggrivating than most, as you'll most likely need to brainbug and control an enemy (which is cool but the process involved is tedious) and flip switches or slide boxes around cause you're too short or fat.  Aiming the brainbugs is an incredibly slow process and the aim arch moves slower then water boils.  I want to add your grenades use the same mechanic, and also you can kill yourself with them too and make them impossible to use practically in combat as the enemy is either juggling you with fire or in your face punching you.  The only thing they seem to have gotten right is the rocket levels to which there are only three (with a name like Rocketbirds you'd assume you'd just jetpack everywhere, apparently not).  My only qualm is the keyboard control scheme and the fact the camera can have a mind of its own, zooming in close or super far out and you looking like a grain of rice.SoundDon't be fooled by the endorsed music.  The only time music ever plays is the title screen, cutscenes and very specific places in the game.  Otherwise you're left with the ambience of a military base or jungle with in-game chat sounding like two iron plates rubbing together in the slowest form imaginable.  Even the endorsed music kinda felt like your generic emo-ish indie fair, I personally didn't like it, but I'll leave that up to personal opinion.ConclusionI never actually bothered to beat this game, as I'm on the last boss and just got so darn frustrated by all the stupid mechanics I ragequit.  Apparently the only easier way to kill that boss is to do the most obnoxious task of finding all the red flags achievement and being gifted a knife to kill it with.  I can't be bothered with that crap, and I'd rather actually play a game that involves strategy then play Russian Roulette."

Think of the worst prog rock crap you heard in the mid 90's and then layer random chicken and gun sound effects over it. Okay sure, that's mean- and subjective. But what isn't subjective is the fact that it's repetetive as hell! And not just in a ""this type of music uses four chords and repeats the same crap over and over again"", but the actual system that delivers the music seems to be somewhat broken- often restarting the music for doing simple things like pausing or walking through a doorway. If the music didn't have vocals, it'd be instantly less annoying- but it'd also have the beneficial side effect of masking the fact that it restarts ALL THE TIME. Okay, so you can turn the music off- let's forgive them this point and move on, shall we?Next, the art. The chickens themselves are actually well designed and interesting- I'll be honest, they're one of the main reasons I flushed $5 down the drain on this one. The hand-drawn look is somewhat unique and appealing- but slap it on some poorly rendered quasi-3D backgrounds that look like something out of a late 90's PSX game and it sucks the life right out of it. But as we all know, fancy art does not a good game make- so again, let's forgive them this point and move on.Gameplay. So much potential.. This seems like one of those ideas that was designed on paper and then executed from start to finish without any usability testing or gameplay prototyping.. none of that 'find the fun' stuff- because it's just not fun. At the end of the day, that's what kills this game for me and it's tragic because it really does have a lot of potential. Imagine playing contra where your dude took up half the screen, moved at a snails pace, rolled at the slightest touch of a button. Now imagine playing that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ized game, only allow shooting left or right, and make it so you waste tons of ammo juggling dead bodies against the edge of a screen while trying to get the guy who's behind the guy you just killed.The one redeeming part of the gameplay were the jetpack segments of the game, which plays a bit like MiniSquadron if you've ever played that. HOWEVER- they manage to donk that up too by constantly changing the focal point of the camera to parts of the sky that your dude isn't even in! So you're controlling a flying chicken completely blind while the game spawns more AI into the field- by the time the camera pulls back you waste time trying to find yourself and orient so you can take on the new enemies. When AI flies offscreen there's no offscreen indicators that hint at where they might be coming from.. so you just fly around hoping to cross paths with them (meanwhile the AI knows exactly where you are at all times).I'm not even going to get into the poorly balanced weapons and ammo system, or the infuriating juggle/stun system.So I can safely recommend that you stay clear of this one, unless A) you're morbidly curious, and B) it's sufficiently discounted."

Levels are hard to read, ""is that a platform i can jump to or not!"", everything in the scene blends together, making it hard to distinguish where to go and why, one time i found myself running above the entire level, as far as i understand i was suppose to do so, but it felt wrong and misplaced.weapons and enemies are so so, enemies are lacking an healthbar making it very hard to judge how many bullets it takes to kill him, there's no indication of how far your weapon reaches, a simple smoke trail would have helped a great deal, only indication that an enemy is dead is the dropping of bullets, and a weapon you can't pickup?, if you like bullet sponges with no indications this is for you.despite all this, graphics is really great, the parallax scrolling effect works well, there's a great sense of depth in the scenes, lightning is great, character animations are great and i did enjoy the flying scene quite a bit. I do think this games deserves a thumbs up, it does have a qualifying production value, but i felt bored playing the game and could not be bothered finishing it, i may pick it up again another day, but until then it's a thumbs down for me."

The aesthetics are also pretty nice...a bit different from the usual, so kudoz on that. Let me think...nope, can't think of anything more. What I really don't get is how this game can get reviews like 5/5 or 9/10...on the store page...this is ridiculous. Even if it wasn't so bad, it would never be THAT good. I read♥♥♥♥♥♥like ""plenty of content""...I beat this in 2.8 hours!!!!!!! And most of it was being stuck...lol. A pro can beat this♥♥♥♥♥♥in under an hour...this is NOT plenty of content...jesus christ.Why you should NOT buy this game, not even during a sale, as I did:You are a chicken...this is cool. You have guns...also cool. This is where cool ends.You can either run or ""roll""...funnily enough the roll move is also the best way of locomotion for 95% of the game. Running was only useful for 1 or 2 precision actions. Rolling can be chained together, it is faster, more responsive, you need it to bypass enemies with shields and 95% of the time whenever you encounter an enemy they will immediately drop down and shoot at you. If you are in ""run"" mode this means you will simply shoot over their heads, miss and die a gruesome and quick death.By the way...enemies. There are a few generic enemy types. Enemies with guns, with bigger guns, with shields and melee weapons and those with rockets. None of those is even remotely challenging on its own, however they have the annoying habit of appearing suddenly BEHIND you, which wouldn't be that bad, but for the following:The game has no continous scrolling background...you move through fixed backgrounds, after about 2-3 seconds you reach the end of a screen and a new screen is instantly loaded. On this screen there can be a number of enemies...you can't know, so I found it best to just be rolling around all the time and instantly shooting as soon as I entered a new screen. Often enough enemies will then enter the screen behind you, while you are already fighting an enemy before you, meaning they will shoot you in the back, which more often than not results in your death or severe health loss and subsequent death on the next screen. The only way to prevent this is to either stick to the very end of a screen, because enemies will not shoot you outside of the current screen or roll behind an enemy and make sure to not have enemies in both directions. They will not shoot one another (the shield guys are an exception, somehow they can be bypassed by enemy bullets).Enemies are also bullet sponges. No matter the weapon, pistol or assault rifle, they will take a whole lot of punishment. This only changes with the final weapon, which does not have a continuous firing mode, but a burst mode...you get that weapon after you have completed 90% of the game...or even more...have I mentioned that you can only shoot left or right? no up/down...nope.Puzzles...this game has ""puzzles"". These puzzles look something like this: There is a Tower with 4 sections and 4 levels or so...the puzzle involves you going from Section A, level 2, to Section B, level 3, collect a card, go to Section C, level 1, collect another card, go to Section D, level 3, mind control a minion, activate some elevator, go to Section C, level 4, ride the elevator down to Section A, level 1, collect another card, lalalalsakgnjfdajkgndfjksgndsjknagjksdnjkganfdgkI can't even! I understand backtracking...what I don't understand is senseless prolonging of levels. I completed this game in about 2-3 hours on normal...most of that time was spent dying randomly or trying to figure some stupid puzzle out that has you going around the whole level multiple times...I especially loved the crates in level 11...♥♥♥♥ you. All the levels are built like this famous ziggurat puzzle or whatever it's called: move the top layer to an empty space, move the next layer to the next empty space, move the first layer back and forth and so on, until you have moved thy ziggurat/Pyramid whatever from 1 place to another...it's horrible design. The final level has you ride different elevators up and DOWN a rocket again, as the villain tries to flee from you!!!!!! WTF? And that after the most boring boss fight in history that lasted ages anyway and didn't even have music...you have to experience this♥♥♥♥♥♥to believe it.Between those levels you can use a jetpack...you might think this would be fun...it's not. The level are literally always the same. There are 2 enemy types, each wave spawning more of each. That's it...survive a few waves then blow up the airships with the same procedure as explained above.You also have grenades, which are pretty useless, because to throw them far you have to stand up. Standing up in a fight usually means you die before you even threw the damn thing. Even behind ""cover""...You also have a sort of brain control thing...this isn't a tottaly useless feature but most of the times you can only use it at fixed points in the game to control an enemy and open a door or move a box or activate an elevator...lame, boring...also sometimes it takes 1 hit, sometimes 3...lol weird.The check points are also a joke. Sometimes you start right after you died, sometimes you have to navigate half of the level again. They are just really awkwardly placed at times. Especially before the final ""wave"" fight...man those are stupid...if you die at the first wave, you have to ride the elevator upwards again...this takes about 10 seconds or so...it's unnecessary. After the first wave though the game saves after every wave and even respawns you with additional health and ammo...lol.The voice acting and writing is so bad, that I almost had to switch the sound off. Luckily they did not use a lot of voice acting. They even have some kind of wannabe Schwarzenegger accent in there...wtf. It's so bad. The writing itself is extremely boring. You do not care about most of the stuff. The best you get out of the story are the cutscenes, which evoke at least some kind of emotion. The soundtrack also helps...You're also being objected to several superfluous text bubbles that you have to endure...nothing really matters but you also can't skip it.The sad part is that I wanted to like this game...but the more I played the more I hated it, so my final voting if I had to would be 5/10, because the soundtrack and the art and the general aesthetic is pretty nice. Gameplay wise this game is junk...sorry.Summary:+ Awesome soundtrack IF you like Alt rock+ Nice setting, different types of birds acting as ""races""+ Nice graphics style in general- bad gunplay- bad movement controls- horrible level design- boring enemy design- at times unfair save points and general situations- no continuous game screen, instead multiple screens per level- boring game mechanics- shallow game play- cringeworthy voice acting- extremely boring story- annoying writing and waiting and elevator rides...so many elevator ridesDo yourself a favour and do not buy this game. Instead by ""Mark of the Ninja"" or ""Shank 1/2"". Those are games that do everything a lot better, have great gameplay and a cool story, while being similar enough to a 2D killing simulator...Ugh...including this review I have wasted about 3-4 hours of my life withthis...why?"

That feels really cheap of me to say, with indie games already being so low cost in most cases compared to AAA titles, but as other reviews have pointed out, the mechanics of gunfighting and the platforming are just not really ""there"" enough. The controls are sluggish and the platforming and a few of the puzzles are kinda frustrating as well. Gunfights in particular are really frustrating, espeically the final ""boss"" once he puts up his shield. You're literally either trying to roll past him (because you have no way to take cover in this particular battle,) or running the opposite direction until you loop around and can fire off one or two bursts before repeating in the opposite direction. For that matter the ""cover"" you CAN get in some areas is pathetic. ""Let me hide around this corner, but no matter how I time it, whenever I pop out of cover the penguins are going to shoot and i'm not going to have enough time to pop off some shots before I die.""That all being said.

You might think it’s a shooting game, but really it’s not. There’s about two really nitty gritty fights where they toss enemies at you, three or so rocket pack fight sections, and a final boss. Other than that shooting is pretty much getting the first hit, or dodge rolling to go and get a first hit.That said, the platforming puzzles can be pretty decent. Nothing to write home about, but with its design, setting, and music it makes the game enjoyable for the most part. IF they do a sequel I think the game could be polished up to be something even more memorable."

The flight combat is sort of hard as you fly where you aim your gun; therefore, you can't fly away from your enemy while also shooting at them.  The other combat is pretty enjoyable, although can get a bit repetitive, especially if you suck like me and keep losing a fight and having to redo it.As for time spent in game, I was able to pick it up and beat it in roughly 3 hours.  Granted, I didn't find all the hidden signs in the game which would have added some more time, but I also didn't feel a need to find those signs.  Often when I would find one, I couldn't figure out how to get it so I just left it behind.  The reward for getting them all isn't anything too special as far as I understand.Regardless, I had this on my wishlist and as soon as it was on sale I purchased it.  I don't feel like I wasted any money here.  While short, it was still enjoyable.  There's just something awesome about being a chicken teaming up with cardinals to take down evil penguins."

I have not played the solo campaign.I found the local co-op difficult to play for several reasons. There's no tutorial, so you have no idea what you can and cannot do. It took me until level 4 to discover that when I was out of ammo, RT became melee. You can't duck behind objects for protection, so you take all hits thrown your way. There's not enough ammo or health drops for two playens. The ""puzzles"" consist mostly of trying to coordinate with your co-op partner where you each need to be at any given moment, since you can't split up beyond any one screen. Hopping on top of your partner always happens at the wrong time,and it's never clear what you can and can't reach.The game mechanic seems to *want* to be non-stop shooting (which is fun), and yet it limits ammo and then suddenly introduces poorly designed puzzles to slow things down even further.The actual game is this: can you jump without snapping onto your partner's shoulders?"

The animation is superb, and the overall presentaion is very well-crafted.  Controls are nice and tight, including an interesting duck-into-an-alcove hiding mechanic which is even nicer if playing in one of the 3D modes.  Speaking of which, several 3D profiles are available, using both red-blue or magenta-green style classic cardboard-and-coloured plastic glasses.  The effect works very well, giving the cell animation style graphics striking depth - although (of course) losing a bit of colour detail.  It's a worthy trade-off though in my opinion, there are precious few games that use this 3D technique and it really shines here.While I usually tend to get impatient during most games' ubiquitous cutscenes, the ones here are highly entertaining and actually add to the mood and story - interruptions, sure, but welcome ones.  They're well written, directed and hilarious!  The voice acting is surprisingly good as well.So though I haven't played all that much yet, I'm loving this game plenty enough to highly recommend it, and will be adding to this review as I continue to experience what it has to offer.  Which includes jetpacks.  Who can say no to that? If youre at all a fan of side-scrolling shooters or platformers, this should be in your library!  Thanks for reading!"

While it's kind of appropriate during the game, there are some ""in-between-levels"" which are just ridiculous. There are waves of enemies attacking you and it's just luck if you beat them or not.Especially the final level is pointless. I gave up after a couple of tries. This might not sound too long - but one attempt takes REALLY long and it's just completely repetitive. In the end it's just trying again and again and again and again and again - waiting for some luck. Because luck is the only gamechanging element in this final level.Actually such a great game!

Destination: Rocketbirds: Hardboiled Chicken. The name is the game! You are Hardboiled, a rooster destined for greatness….wait. What? Yeah, right! You have to free the birds from the brutal penguin reign of terror! For real! Also contains jetpacks.First look at the game:also available as VOD on twitchHardboiled Chicken is a side scrolling action-platformer with light puzzle elements and heavy jetpack elements!The game goes for some of the usual: You can pick up different weapons; you can climb and jump, hang on to ledges and first and foremost kill a lot of evil penguins.But that is nearly it with the usual. Between missions in the campaign that take place on the ground (or underground) you have to get your jetpack on and go for some aerial combat awesomeness! That rocks!Besides the usual mp, pistol shotgun routine you get a supply of “Brainbugs” that let you control penguins. And have them do your chores for you. Also lets you kill the mindcontrolled penguin by suicide. Not beautiful or heroic.Did I mention jetpacks?! And there are some parts in the game where you have to move crates around or find a certain penguin to press a button you cannot yet reach. Not the best moments of the game. But let´s focus on the more important JETPACK part, alright?Look and feel and sound:Hardboiled Chicken comes with a nice soundtrack, very good looking environment and solid controls. It seems at times a bit weird how the pistol fires, jumping can be a bit difficult to aim. But in all honesty: It is just damn fun to play this game. Also, just to briefly mention it: It is totally weird and a bit insane at times. But that is fun too! The puzzle parts do feel like a distraction and don´t fit in as well as all the other ideas in this game.Captains Orders:If you got a co-op buddy this game will really shine, as a single-player game it is good fun for in-between. I would say grab it when it´s on sale for 5 to 10 € and go for it.Verdict:Cargo!  Will just put it in once in a while to jetpack around a bit or get a friend to play it with me. That’s just a fun little game! No more, no less.For more Reviews visitCaptNemo's LogFor Gameplay Videos and live streaming visitCaptN3mo's twitch channel"

There are no stealth kills, hard puzzles or platforming.You can shoot in a straight line while rolling around at penguins also rolling around and shooting in a straight line, no altering the angle up or down and melee attacks seem to just stun. I'm not sure because I give up after about 10 hits and the bird just rolls away from me and starts shooting in a straight line. Until I easily kill it with a weapon.On some levels you can fly a jet pack that accelerates extremely fast and shoot in a straight line with a fast strong gun that you don't use on the ground for some reason.I feel slightly bad not recommending this game even at the sale price of $1:50. It has so much potential to make it fun or at least some variation.In then end though you will just end up shooting in a straight line using only the left mouse button and space bar, probably getting bored 20 minutes into it. This game seems like it would be good for someone who's hands got crippled in an accident, although some acts like moving a box (Shift + L) may cause difficulty to for progression of rolling around and shooting in a straight line since you can't rebind the controls."

,Recommended,215510,18965571,"Posted: 8 November, 2015",all,Baphomet,"Rocketbirds: Hardboiled Chicken is a side-scrolling action game starring a former-experiment turned chicken mercenary (Hardboiled) on a quest for vengeance against the evil penguin empire. The art style is very cartoony but yields a sadistic undertone through various bloody cinematics and player actions.Gameplay in Rocketbirds is vaguely reminiscent of the Oddworld series with encounters that resemble that of Another World. By which I mean: movement and aiming is a bit jerky and awkward and the game will often put you in a situation where enemies will be coming at you from both sides of the screen. In some instances these two factors can result in some very infuriating battles, but since the checkpoint system is so generous, you’ll probably make it through after a few tries. Another neat thing the game gives you is the ability to mind control enemies with a throwable grenade-like device enabling you to use them to solve puzzles and remove enemies before having them remove themselves with a self-inflicted gunshot wound.True to the name, a good part of the game will be spent flying around with a rocket strapped to your back. These sequences are generally marathon sessions of spawn, kill, spawn, and kill again, but manage to still be fun as the controls are pretty good and you can do neat tricks like leading enemy missiles back towards them through clever maneuvering.If I had to pick a downside with this game it would be the extremely short length coupled with the really bad voice acting (the latter was probably done on purpose). Though for the frequent sale price of around $2, it’s hard to complain!"

At first that may seem to be social commentary, but  fact, most of the cutscenes are just watered-down cliches from various war films. The story is ONLY there to give reason to your extermination of the penguin general population. And what an extermination it is. The gameplay, despite a few issues (Why can't the mouse be used to AIM my weapon?) is solid, and it's great fun slaughtering large numbers of fowl. It doesn't look half bad, either. The art is phenomenal, and the psuedo-3D levels, backgrounds and characters are well designed, having an almost comic-book feel. Finally, the coop is amazingly fun, despite having to load every other level and have Hardboiled stare you down for about forty seconds while it loads.

You, the nameless chicken, was captured by the penguin regime when small and brainwashed into being the ultimate commando, but on a mission, you were shock by the atrocity, and saw a younger version of yourself and reverted back to being on the chicken side. However, you are alone, and aside from a few resistance members, there is no help. But it doesn't matter... You will destroy Putzki, head of the Penguin regime, and end their reign of terror... or die trying (well, there's always reload from checkpoint).The game is basically a platformer shooter where you need to jump, crouch, and otherwise shoot, ambush, and kill your way through the penguin army in your quest. As you continue, you gain additional weapons. You start with a trusty pistol, but you will soon upgrade to SMG, shotgun, and later, assault rifle, and you also gain the use of grenades and ""brainbugs"" that can remote control a penguin if you can get it close enough and have the penguin kill penguins for you, at least for a little while. The puzzles are bascially trying to get the keycards to advance to a different part of the map, and that obviously requires some backtracking, and crate stacking, and so on to allow you to access ledges that were not otherwise accessible.There are ""timed sections"" where you fight your way through a penguin zepplin to the escape hatch, and that can get REALLY hairy!The rocket fights are rather cute, as you basically control this rocket pack, which only has on, or off. You can control the direction, and if you turn rocket off, you go on inertia until gravity takes over. This can let you shake pursuers and shoot them full of lead as they fly by (i.e. the Maverick maneuver from Top Gun) . Penguins also have helicopter rocketeers who shoots guided rockets at you but if you fly carefully you can guide the rocket to hit an enemy instead before they self-destruct due to lack of fuel. Once you got everybody, you either land on the zepplin and fight through it, or you make your way back to the ground for more penguin destruction.The game slowly introduces tougher enemies and the pacing is about just right. Long cutscenes between some levels setup the stage and shows the back history of the world and how it got to the present day. It is quite a bit of fun, and there's even a coop mode (which I didn't try). My only gripe is the timed sections being a bit too hard, even on normal. IMHO, of course.May not be worth full price, but it's definitely worth trying if you like some action every once in a while."

The soundtrack alone is also worth buying the game for, honestly I'm only writing this review right now because I came back to the purchase page to see if I could buy the soundtrack when it prompted me for a review. The storyline is amusing in that it doesn't take itself too seriously yet doesn't fail to re-create the character stereotypes you'd expect from the genre (think Stalone, Willis, etc.,.). Like all beat 'em ups, you have to have an appreciation for the genre, and an understanding of what it is and is not. This isn't going to be a 30+ hours game. It's not going to tug on your heart strings and weave a deep, lengthy, philosophical tale that makes you re-examine life and its meaning.

,Not Recommended,215510,14533076,"Posted: 18 February, 2015",all,Dumle,Might have been fun if the co-op actually worked. Whoever is not hosting gets freeze lag every second or so. Makes it completely unplayable.I found a thread from 2012 where people were talking about the same very problem.http://steamcommunity.com/app/215510/discussions/0/864951657753894398Kind of sucks that old game breaking issues still have not been fixed. DO NOT RECOMMEND!
,Recommended,215510,29868862,Posted: 12 February,all,wyulf,"a fun lil game, with nice art, and what i personally feel, a sufficient length (not too short, yet not too long that it becomes draggy). the game itself is fairly basic. nothing overly complex about the controls. the 'puzzles' are not overly challenging, neither are most of the enemies once you figure their patterns.although i dont know too much how multiplayer would pan out (i just got on the game, so not many people playing it anymore), but videos of it do seem kinda fun.all in all, a fun semi-casual game to play, but perhaps could use with a bit more depth.*edit* multiplayer IS more fun, although would be nicer if it had slightly more elaborate puzzles."

It often goes on sale for mere cents, it's short but I think it's a fun experience. I haven't felt compelled to replay it though, I am sure it's different for people who play it cooperatively."

,Recommended,215510,33503698,Posted: 13 July,all,psyCtrl,"Decent simple sidescrolling fun where you play ""Hardboiled Chicken"" a military trained chicken that revolts against a dystopian facist regime of penguins. Sounds funny? It is.+ Cool hand-drawn digital art and amusing writing+ Nicely polished game with few flaws+ Some little gameplay variation (i.e. Jetpack Shmup)+Simple run 'n gun gameplay, topped with some little puzzles"
,Recommended,215510,33439774,Posted: 10 July,all,Eddy,Fun break from the norm.Pros: Simple fun.Funny moments galore.Puzzle-ish at times.Recommend playing on Hard for a challenge.Cons: Some spots are more unfair and hope for the best.A little repetitive.Overall I'd still recommend trying it out. I enjoyed the story.
