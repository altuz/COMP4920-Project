Nothing moves and they just squeeze out the money from customers giving em an 20% done Alpha version. If you want to burn your money just hold a lighter under your money bill. it will do the same effect but faster and less frustrating

I don't think many people bought this, and to be honest it isn't worth the price in it's current state. If you do pick it up look in the forums for detailed explanation of the controls because they are not in the game, even though it tries to fool you by offering a controls option which is entirely misleading. Kind of a waste of time and money if you ask me."

There are 2 ""classes""; one that is a bit tougher, and one that is a bit faster.There are a bunch of different weapons, but as far as I can tell they all do the same damage and combos/specials, and a bunch of cosmetics (shirts shoes, pants, backpacks, etc.)The core gameplay is running around whacking zombies with your melee weapon or shooting them with your range, your melee gets combos with finishers, combos being x--> y    x--> x--> y   x--> x--> x--> y and your pistol gets like a grenade charge thing.As it stands now I cant reccomend this game, because as it turns out, this game is complete."

I feel like I need an option for in between Yes and No. I like the art style, the options for customization, the music and the a lot of the gameplay. I have a huge problem with the camera work (more on that later) and the seeming lack of story/objective. I understand that this is a work in progress so here is what I'd like to see; the option for story mode and simple run and gun gameplay. More character options. More levels. Achievements. You see where I'm going. I think this is a good foundation and after the bugs are worked out and more content is added Zombie Playground will be a great addition to your game library. Fingers crossed."

It locks you on to a zombie and forces you to strike in that certain direction which takes some of the freedom out of it.This review probably isn't the best in terms of explaining the game but hopefully helpful enough for you to decide if you want to try it out :D I haven't played a lot of this game so there's possibly a lot of stuff I'm missing but this is what I picked up from the beginning of the game.Here is some gameplay if you would like to take a look at the game before you buy it, the video may contain spoilers:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-CcdxesPhM"

,Recommended,215550,17272162,"Posted: 28 July, 2015",all,Elenath,"I highly recommend this game.Is it perfect? Nope.Does it have fun issues like Zombies coming through doors? Yeah, occasionally, But so does DayZ and that's been out since December 2013.They're not the same game of course. DayZ is survival and this is, well fun.You get to run around as a kid, customize your character to wear gas masks, have backpacks and a dog. Plastic baseball bat? You've got it. Nail guns (not child friendly) they're there too.Paintball gun? Yep.Remember those paper cutters you had in school that you used to be terrified of because you thought your hand was gonna get chopped right off? Well those are weapons too.It needs some work, sometimes in Multiplayer you'll get locked in place. Sometimes one of your friends is just floating and sliding about, but on his screen he's being a bad A 3rd grader. No one is judging.It's challenging enough that it holds my interest.I posted a screenshot and the dev commented. How cool is that? They're paying attention.it's really easy to get into a game and play when you've only got a few minutes to kill, and if you want to invest more time I'm sure it's the same level of easy.I don't normally write reviews, but I saw this one had mixed reviews on the first day, and I don't think that's fair. It's fun, Worth the 15 dollars in my book and I've only played for a little over an hour and a half, however, I see myself putting a lot more into it.If you're on the fence, watch some gameplay or streams of it, if you're a fan of supporting devs get this, but remember it's in Early Access so as mentioned, there will be some issues.If you have no desire to play this then you probably didn't have a childhood where you got to play on a playground and pretend you were saving all your friends from monsters."
,Recommended,215550,21082954,"Posted: 9 February, 2016",all,Rinera,"If there was an option to vote ""Wait till it gets better"", I would chose that. It's a promising game, but right now it has a few issues that make playing it unenjoyable.Well, the core of the game at least is in a promising state. Combat is fun enough to justify fighting zombies for hours and there is a fair amount of customization options already in the game. Probably more unlocks than one would be willing to grind for.The problem is that in less than 2 hours I've already experienced everything available (apart from multiplayer). Another ""bugger"" (pun intended) is the framerate as the game runs terribly bad. There are complaints about the camera controls, though I quite like it as it is, provided that performance is fixed at some point.Still, the dev remains relatively active in the forums so it's not an abandoned project, and once they fix the performance and add a bit more variety in terms of enemies, it would be quite fun to grind for those unlockables."

I love how I customized my character, but that's slightly off-topic. I haven't heard about this until today, and it once and a while skips a few frames and the sensitivity is out of whack for me, but that's most likely how my computer feels like acting right now. Anyway, it's definitely a good way to spend your money, even if you can barely afford it. It's a zombie game, so it doesn't sound original at first, of course, but I doubt there are many, (if any) games with similar themes. I haven't played much either, but it's awesome so far, heh."
,Recommended,215550,17566359,"Posted: 16 August, 2015",all,Lowrater,"Zombie Playground is a RPG childhood nostalgia with zombies in a visceral combat with a school atmosphere.The game offers singleplayer and multiplayer, to either have fun alone or with others. The game has six different missions to play and challenge your self in the current school area. The equipment option gives a large scale of costumization of your child character, which gives a enjoyment to be the cool kid back in the days. There is currently two classes, which is either a bully as tank or Rascal as a agility class. Every player has a mele weapon aswell for pistols. - And for those who like dogs, then you can get a dog.While playing the game we notice the EA stage has the same design of zombies everywhere besides the bosses. The school environment is damaged and should be any childs nightmare, but with the skill set and feeling of character control, should not stop them to wipe their asses.Overall, the game has potential where i can imagine that the game has alot to come in the future. If you want to be young again and beat up everyone including your teacher for giving you homework, then you have the chance to to that repeatedly until you are satisfied.Here is a demo:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nU2d10Iwwqo"

The dev(s) are responsive on the Steam forums (the website is not maintained, apparently), and with some tweaks this could be a really fun arcade-style ""beat em up"" with a quirky aesthetic and feel.It's still definitely got an early-access feel to it at this point, it's difficult to play solo at points, and it lacks some polish and depth. Looks nice with a lot of bright colors and surprisingly detailed environments.Recommended, but with the above caveats. I've seen worse for a higher price, but I can't shake the feeling the game isn't at 100% of its potential. Not yet anyway."
,Recommended,215550,26696828,"Posted: 19 November, 2016",all,red-nyan,"I rate this game:6/10The Reason:While that rating may seem low, my reason is a bit bias; See I bought this game around Halloween of 2015, when it was still in early access. The devs released the update info for the halloween update, and I was quite happy with the game in its early stages. After the halloween update however, the devs completely stopped releasing patch information, and I assumed the devs had simply abandoned the game. Until November of 2016, when I decided to play what I thought was the early access, abandoned, Zombie Playground. To my surprise the game was out of early access and had10missions. Because the devs didn't do a good job of posting update information I am lowering my rating of this game.The ReviewThis game is a short, but fun, zombie beat 'em up. The mechanics of the game play decently enough, The dash is a bit frustrating since you can't use it while airborn and it kind of stops your forward motion after the dash (I just think the player should slow down a touch more gradually than they currently do). The game has a jump, but for the most part it has no purpose, perhaps adding a double jump or a ledge grab would make the jump seem useful, bringing it back to the dash, another use could be jumping and then dashing (Just saying). The missions are short, each mission takes less than 5 minutes to complete (If your rushing, which is how I normally play games), which isn't a bad thing, since they are so short I really don't mind replaying them like I would in other mission-type games.Overall the attacks are pretty fluid, the enemies are a bit underwhelming, but thats to be expected from children zombies. The 2 abilities that each class gets could use a few more, I would love more classes as well, but I am still quite happy with what I get from the game. The movement could use some work, and it wouldn't hurt for a dozen more missions, but All together I think this is a good game to pass the time with."

Running around a school yard and smacking around creepy zombie kids & faculty with a paper cutter blade is a nice twist to the generic ""shoot a zombie"" approach. Though in it's early stages, there's a fair ammount of customization to your character's appearance, and I suspect more would be added upon a completed release. So far there are just two classes ""Bully"" & ""Rascal"", and personally, I'm hoping for a ""Geek/Nerd"" class. Perhaps a quirky looking kid who can use a modified Bunson Burner to set his enemies a flame. There's lots of possibilities here and I hope all aspects are fully fleshed out for it's release. Controls could be a bit more solid, and there are the expected hiccups with an early access version, but I believe Zombie Playground can inject a bit of juvinile glee to a bloated genre of gaming that's made me somewhat weary of the walking dead. More classes, More fun weapons, More customization, better control handling and I think it will be a solid release."
