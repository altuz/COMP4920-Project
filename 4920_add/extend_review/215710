,Recommended,215710,7452724,"Posted: 22 October, 2013",all,EdoMan,"A semi-open enenmy pathing mechanic makes this game exceptional.  Similar to how sanctum works, the enemy path is created by you as you maze your towers as effectively as possible.  Enemy re-pathing isn't always consistent and can lead to difficulty disigning mazes at harder levels that limit your design by introducing new level mechanics or obstacles.  Good fun overall and recommended for any casual td player."

Why?1) it is obviously a tablet game. That means there aren't many functions, everything is realy big and the gameplay is very slow. The first level after the tutorial takes 50 waves and there isn't even a ""next wave"" button, only fast forward but it still takes far too long to end it.2) It has micro transactions although it costs 10€ and that is definitely a rip off. You need the coins to unlock new towers or helpful ingame items. And if you don't want to invest money you have to connect it to facebook and twitter and that is one thing I don't appreciate when you are indirectly be forced to do some ""free advertising"" for a game.3) The enemies are very one dimensional. That means the only get faster or more health and as the waves progress they just get more health over time. So you are fighting the same enemies over and over again.In my opinion you might be still able to enjoy it but I don't think it can be long-lasting.If there would be a possibility to install steam games on a tablet then I might play it more often."

,Recommended,215710,6295658,"Posted: 24 April, 2013",all,Noana,"In it's simplest and purest form, this Strategy game proves once more that bigger / complicated isn't always better. Unlike some other Tower Defense games, you can really influence the game because you have to make a path for the units. It's not liked the locations for the towers are fixed. Whenever a Tower Defense game makes use of this type of Tower Placement, it already scores a lot of points on my list.The core of the game is very solid, the levels are very challenging ( Depending on one of the three difficulties ) and the amount of control you can practise on the battlefield is amazing. This can be done by making complicated choices between Quanitity and Quality. For Example: Do i want to build 4 more chaingun towers? Or do i want to build a tower that slows units down, thus giving the excisting towers more time to destroy them. And do i want to spread the towers out over the map or do i want a very dense 'killing zone'?I can certainly recommend this game. Even to people that aren't into Tower Defense games. If you're doubting, just do it!"

Obviously aimed at mobile money markets with microtransactions removed for PC, this is definitely the worst tower defense game I've played in several years. Generic cartoony graphics don't even attempt to hide the lack of originality or character (but still somehow the game has long load times even on 2500k @ 4ghz, GTX 780, 16gb DDR3, and SSD). The levels, characters, and art design are generic flash TD fodder and have not a single iota of verve, originality, or even competence.Seriously, I wonder if all the other products that this game rips off even realize it? For example I bet Valve doesn't realize that they stole the TF2 Heavy model and animations almost verbatim (plus the TF2 soldier model and anims, just to name two), and several other models and animations have been copied slavishly from other titles. There are almost no options in the game for anything whatsoever. As far as I can tell there is no hotkey to instantly restart a level, or to bring up the normal ESC menu with the normal options. Apparently you have to click on it, because if you hit ESC it instantly asks you if you want to quit the game. Clueless, greedy, incompetent mobile devs. Yuck.Beyond the simplistic mobile approach and total lack of creativity, competency, or imagination, the worst failing of Fieldrunners 2 is that it's built entirely around the worst TD grind mechanics you can imagine, and they're all hidden invisibly underneath a layer of flash/mobile simplicity. The waves are seemingly endless, randomly thrown together without thought, and invisibly leveled in HP while still using the same models and animations, with no indication that the enemies are gaining massive amounts of HP. There is no ""next wave"" button or indication of what the next wave comprises. One of the earliest levels has 50, yes FIFTY equally boring and generic waves, most of which comprised identical looking enemies whose HP scaled invisibly up to the moon. Who likes that? Maybe someone on mobile who has never seen a tower defense game, but even then only for the first hour or two.I get that the game sucks and grinds purely to drive microtransactions, but I rebel against this negative approach to game design. It creates enemies out of your customers and generally makes people hate you. -I- personally hate you, Subatomic Studios, for this game. You created an enemy out of me, and I will make sure to track your company in the future purely to avoid your products and warn people about how much you suck. This game should have never been released on PC, or anywhere. It is trash. Total, complete, and utter trash."

Compared to the first game that was pretty mediocre, the developers listened to the playes and changed everything around: Towers now show where they shoot, so the Lightning Tower that only shows in 4 directions doesn't have a  circle but the 4 directions. You get informations about how much DPS the various Towers actually do and the maps are a lot more creative with bridges and trenches and the ability to make the Fieldrunners go in circles like idiots....there's nothing better than that.There are a lot more weapons and the special weapons you need to buy with coins you collect, i don't think that forcing a player to ""like"" the game on Facebook and Twitter in exchange of coins is a good way, but you'll earn enough of them by playing the game regardless. There are puzzle maps too and a lot more story and special unique enemies like a legendary panzer and even the Hindenburg.

A few other games are the same. Runs normal  and at 60fps in a window.It could do with giving you a lot more gold for unlocking towers.Pretty hard as well. I've got to a certain point and i'm stuck there.Maybe i'll get past it after unlocking more towers.Setting up towers to do combo kills does extra damage i think but i could be wrong.Could be why i'm stuck. I probably have to learn how to combo all the towers to get farther.
