Shad’O is not hard enough.-/- Game can be beat using only 3-4 out of the 10 towers (with the last boss requiring only two towers to beat).-/- Voice Acting.-/- Requires you to download QuickTime or QT Lite in order to play.Verdict: 6/10.  The style is what stands out most in Shad’O as well as the few boss fights.  But it’s a very generic TD game and probably only worth a play through for hardcore TD fans desperate for anything new."

,Not Recommended,215770,11154684,"Posted: 9 July, 2014",all,Haylel,"Requires you to install quicktime, but doesn't work with current version.So if you already have quicktime you have to uninstall it and then install QTLite to get this game to run.If you actually need to have quicktime installed for something else to function (iTunes), QTLite will break that.Even GFWL games gave me less problems than this game.IF you can get it to run, it's a decent tower defense game.But I'd take Pixeljunk Monsters, Kingdom Rush, or even Super Sanctum TD over this,since you can actually just install those and have them work."

Requires replaying some of the scenarios until the mobs' abilities are learned.Two minor cons are apparent: Quicktime installation is required and the poor English translation of a somewhat mediocre over-arching storyline detracts from the game slightly, however the basic concept of fighting inside one's nightmares is otherwise well executed and lends itself to interesting environments.- Skinny from the Fat B*stard(curator link)"

Frustrating gameplay that more or less forces you to do some ""Tower Juggeling"" where you have to sell towers and build in new spots on almost every level. To bad for a game that has a very nice artstyle that i enjoyed."

,Not Recommended,215770,1524862,"Posted: 6 July, 2013",all,Ryebread,"There are few games that I find myself unwilling and unable to complete. This is one of them. It has an interesting mechanic of territory control (pushing shadows back with your imaginary tower-friends), and it creates a nice sombre tone with its cut-scene art.However, it is ultimately a tower defense game that lacks player-friendliness and failed to have an impact on me. Skill points that you allocate are absolutely permanent. If you find yourself unhappy or unable to progress because of your skills, you'll have to restart the game from scratch to repick your skills. Further, winning battles leaves me unsatisfied, and I'm more irritated than distraught when I lose my units, little yellow plushies with no personality. The cut-scene art is nice, but the inexpert voice-acting can be grating if you pay attention to it.Lastly, installing this game means you have to install Quicktime as well. This is how the game plays its cutscenes. It's pointed out in the requirements (har har as if we read those), but if you have the same hate on Apple I've noticed in some Steam threads, then this is just icing on the ""Try something else"" cake. I only recommend this game to hardcore tower-defense game enthusiasts who enjoy skill-picking with no backtracking, and who do not listen to cut-scenes."

There are only two speeds, very slow and less slow - and even with them I have tons of time just sitting and waiting.Even the map and menus are slow, lots of unnecessarily slow animations for things you have to see many, many times.Other than that, the game is fine - well made, runs well on my machine, cute, and balanced - but sooooo slow."

However this is not for the faint hearted, one the easiest setting I struggled my way through the game and was unable to finish all the special missions.The level design and gameplay is great, I throughly enjoyed it. The story is interesting and what seems obvious at first turns out not to be so obvious. The voice acting is a little off-kilter but quirkishly amusing."

The story is vaguely creepy as you are reclaiming a little boy's memories from ""Shad'o"" a murky mess of shadow and gloom.  This is one of the more challenging TD titles Ive played.  As with every other game - its worth buying, just not at full price.  Wait for a sale and enjoy."

Plenty of various towers, plenty of various enemies to kill with said towers. It also has an interesting story-line and structure with some unique game elements. I just had two major issues with the game. The first was that the unique elements, while being thematically relevant, didn’t really add much to the gameplay itself, but only served as slight annoyances, hindering you in a way that other tower defenses don’t. This lead to my other issue with the game and is something I’m a little reluctant to complain about since it sounds whiny… but the game was hard.Admittedly, Shad’O was a bit of a disappointment for me as it was a good example of poor game design and ‘game features’ that took away from the game rather than adding. An interesting story was developing in front of me and I’ll probably never see the outcome as I can’t get past the first chapter.For full review, visit:http://icarusreviews.net/2013/07/08/shado/"
