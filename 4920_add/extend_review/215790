,Not Recommended,215790,13820703,"Posted: 3 January, 2015",all,Praxis-[CE],"I love pinball. And when I got a 90% off coupon for Dream Pinball 3D, I read the reviews here and I knew what I was getting into. But I took it as a bit of a challenge, to see if I could actually get the game up and running and evaluate it on its own merits, or lack thereof. It wasn't very difficult to get going (who doesn't use a backup email and info for internet purposes these days anyway?, set compability mode for XP, and as an extra step I went ahead and added the .exe to DEP since I run Win 8.1). As long as you don't try to do anything fancy, like alt-tab or upload your scores or load the registration window, or exit, it's sort of stable. I didn't get any crashes during the game itself anyway.The screen ratio is stretched in widescreen, and even though 16:9 is an option those resolutions can't be set. Nothing, it seems, can be done about that. I'd also recommend cranking down the effects since all the bloom, reflection, glass, lighting, etc. seems to do is make it really hard to see your ball whizzing around the distorted table. Also, there is no controller support, and the default key settings were oddly configured but could be changed.There are 6 tables, they're nothing special really, but they're not the worst I've played. The play isn't anything novel for pinball, but it's got all the combos, multiball, missions, extra balls, etc. you expect from a decent table. The physics aren't really comparable to Pinball Arcade and the theming and missions aren't even in the same league as Pinball FX2, two outstanding pinball games which can be downloaded on Steam free with a single free table each. I did find it a bit easier to keep my ball alive on the Dream Pinball 3D tables than I generally do in the other pinball games, which was nice for a change of pace as a relatively novice player.In all, I feel like I personally got my 70 cents' worth just to satisfy my own curiousity, but I can't really recommend the game unless you're a die-hard pinball fanatic and you're stuck with a 10 year-old computer you can't run anything better on. I'm probably going to throw this on an old laptop that I use for ancient DOS games since I think it will run fine with all the useless bells and whistles turned off and the screen ratio won't be an issue."

I only got this because I got a 90% off coupon from making a badge and thought $1 for pinball is a good deal. Sadly, it still felt like a ripoff.First thing that happens when you launch this is you have to register the game and include stuff like your full name, email, phone#, etc. If you don't do this, you won't be getting the full game you paid for. After taking a few minutes to fill in info I was sure wasn't gonna be used for anything [Update: They wanted all that stuff to send me newsletters for their other stuff. Yeah, no thanks.], I was ready to play this...only to have the controller not respond to the game. At first I thought you had to change the input from keyboard to controller. Nope. Game doesn't support controllers. I wouldn't make a big deal about this if this was originally released in say, 2001. This game came out in 2008. Inexcusable.Now for the gameplay. The game comes with 6 tables of different themes. Now 6 good tables would be worth the $10 price. These 6 didn't feel like they were worth the $1 I payed. Gameplay just felt so dull and slow that I didn't even bother to play the tables seriously. The bad music and camera angles didn't exactly help either. This was just a mess all around. After 1 playing of it, this was uninstalled and never played again.If you want to spend $10 on pinball, get either Pinball Arcade or Pinball FX and spend it on the packs. Sure you might get less tables, but they'll actually be worth it."

Well this is maybe 97 cents worth (which is what I paid for it).  2 tips: uncheck the register box so you don't have to give them your name address and life history, but can still unlock the game, and turn off all the fancy graphics options.  With most games when you turn everything to max settings it's a good thing.  Not so with this game. The bloom effect is blinding and the glass reflection makes it impossible to see anything. shut it all off. The main reason I can't recomend this game tho is because it doesn't seem to support widescreen, even tho there is a 16:9 setting in the options.- and the resolutions they give you to choose from seem random and strange. Don't bother, I like pinball as a distraction, but i was bored with this one right quick...."

76561197966003977,Not Recommended,215790,8550720,"Posted: 4 January, 2014",all,XP-Lionheart,"Highly NOT recommend.So much is just not right with the game. First off, there are several pinball 'games', but they seem so much like the same game, with altered 'themes', but the performance is so similar. Example, they all have bonus multipliers 2,4,6,8,10. None of them have a 'skill shot' start to speak of, and that all seem to have the same voice narrating.The biggest complaint I have about the game is the camera views. It comes with a seisure warning, for a reason. The logic behind 'changing your chosen camera angle' gets more than frustrating. Multiball has no sense of capturing a ball. A target gets hit & it 'locks' a multiball, but the ball continues from that spot, so no lock takes place (In every version of the game).So, say you hit multiball & one of the several balls goes into an area that the AI thinks you should be watching in some super-nifty view, then the camera angle you chose goes away & if another ball is headed toward your main flippers, you'd better be good at using the Force, because it won't be on your screen. Then, say for one of the many times during the game you want to toggle back to your prefered view ... well there seems to be no rhyme or reason to what order they cycle through. And while you can choose your hot key for camera view, it won't go straight to your chosen view, it cycles in some awful order.I could go on about how there are odd things like flames on all 5 pinball tables (even the underwater version). But I'll stop here, and suggest you move on down the street to another game. I bought mine 90% off with a Steam 'reward' for completing a trade card set, but it was one of the most hideous gaming experiences of my life. If I was paid $15.00 to try it again for the same time I have used it for $1.00 . . . I'd turn down the cash."

,Not Recommended,215790,8755651,"Posted: 18 January, 2014",all,UjuidarEhcram,"Dream Pinball 3D is a pretty standard pinball game with several different tables. Sadly, this game is far inferior to Pinball FX2, which is far better and offers tables with deeper gameplay at a lower price.Let's start with the camera. This game actually made me motion sick. Games never have that impact on me. Heck, I regularly play my 3DS with the 3D turned on, and I've played a lot of games that should really cause nausea without any problems, but this game got to me. That's how bad the camera is. You can choose to zoom out and have the camera be fixed, but then you can't see any of the details on the board, or you can stick with the close-up that moves at the same speed as the ball, so you still can't really see much, and twists and turns to completely disorient you.Next, the controls. One thing I love about other pinball games is that you can use an Xbox controller and use the triggers to control the pinball flippers. This game supports controllers, but only barely, and it doesn't accept analog buttons like the triggers. Also, you can't use the controller in the menus; you must use keyboard and mouse. I could configure JoyToKey, and I would, but I don't plan to start this game up again.The tables aren't bad in this game, they're just unremarkable.Also, when I tried to turn this game off, it crashed so hard I had to reboot my computer (it refused to let me access the Task Manager to kill it). Thanks, Dream Pinball 3D.From the whole presentation of this game, you'd swear it was made in 2000. Maybe this game would've been fine at the time, but we have better games to choose from now. At $7, this game is a complete joke. I think I picked this game up on sale for $0.70, and while I don't think this game was worth what I paid, I can't be too mad at having wasted less than a dollar. As I mentioned before, Pinball FX2 is the far superior game, and I'd recommend buying a few new tables for that game instead of playing Dream Pinball 3D at all."

76561198040828171,Recommended,215790,18452009,"Posted: 12 October, 2015",all,Atari Ninja,"Let me start off by saying that I did not aquire this game for free. I paid for it and am glad that I did. There are issues with it though, so let me start with those. When attempting to launch this game it generally won't unless you click Compatibilty Mode. That does the trick for me, but others have complained that it didn't do any good when they tried it, so fair warning. I'm using Windows 7.  There are several resolution settings, although there are a few that I've never run across before.The second issue has to do with registration of the game. The form asks for alot of personal information, but once filled out it works for me, but a few have complained that once filled in the program refuses to run until all blocks are 'filled in'. I didn't have this issue.  I've noticed that the game has a tendency to crash if I inadvertently hit the Space Bar when the action gets frantic. Normally the Space Bar is used for the Plunger. If I can avoid that mistake all is well, although it has happened a few times, usually when I have an enormous score built up.There are six tables, each with a different theme, and various difficulty settings. Novice. Normal. Hard. Expert. I wish the tables were brighter, but that may just be my personal prefrence. The tables are good, but aren't up to the standards set by Zen studios with it's Pinball FX2 game. Plus Zen offers 57 tables with more features and are about to release more. Pinball FX2 sells it's tables as DLCs with one free table. Dream Pinball 3D has no DLC stuff to buy. Many complained (not me) when a bug in the game forced Zen to reset the Leaderboards (not the Local scores though), but Dream Pinball 3D doesn't even have a Leaderboard. Just local scores. You can upload your scores with Dream Pinball 3D, but I have no idea where they go when you do so. This function fails to work alot of the time anyway.This game is alot of fun though, especially if you like old-school pinball. The game itself is about 8 years old so it's starting to show it's age. The ball physics are good and there are actual goals to achieve, unlike Fantastic Pinball Thrills which has neither. The controls take getting use to. The Left Flippers are controlled by the Left Shift key, and the Right Flippers are controlled by the Enter key. Gameplay is solid.The High Score screen has scores already entered as default scores to aim for. If you don't at least reach the lowest high score then the game will momentarily display your score beneath the high scores. As you achieve higher and higher high scores the target scores go up. So it becomes more and more difficult to reach the minimum, assuming of course that you never improve.  Learning the goals of each table and how to achieve them is key.  Some tables, like Amber Moon for example, have more than one way to increase the multiplier.I like it. Currently 38 friends of mine own this game and 4 want it. I believe I have logged more play time than any of them. This may have to do with the difficulty some have had getting this game to work. Use Compatibility Mode. If you still have issues then try different resolution settings. The game was developed by A.S.K. Homework Game Development, who also developed Zaccaria Pinball for Android devices. This game has also been released for the DS and wii."

There are better, cheaper options, and when your biggest product tie-in is with Two Worlds, a series that A) the developers own the rights to and B) is known for being of questionable quality on its own, you know you have some problems right out of the gates.Let's start with the basics, shall we? Other than the resolution issue visual presentation of the tables is okay. The menus are sparse at best, but they are easy to navigate and clear and concise in the function of all the options available. Tables have particle effects at times, and some mip mapping of textures on certain surfaces to keep things dynamic and interesting, though if you play with table glass enabled the reflections on said glass do get in the way of a lot of the table's detail. I still recommend keeping the glass on, however, because it also helps to cover up some of the bigger flaws the tables have in their artistic design, mostly centered around sub-par artwork in general. Several of the tables -- like Monsters and the aquatic-themed table -- bear more of a resemblance to discount store product packaging than they do to pinball tables, with a combination of poorly drawn characters and questionable photoshop work providing the bulk of their visual design.That said, the visuals have little to do with the way the tables themselves play, which is, again, okay. Ball physics are ho-hum, with a feel closer to the old 3D Ultra Pinball games than the likes of Pinball Arcade or Pinball FX, but are perfectly playable and easily predictable, even familiar to those who grew up with older PC and console video pinball titles more than real-world tables. Likewise, the table designs are acceptable. There is little in the way of creative features or multiple playable levels to the tables, meaning tables often feel cramped and small. Many of the tables feature extra flippers placed in almost arbitrary locations, doing little to supplement the table's flow or play at all, with Spinning Rotors featuring a set of tiered flippers in the middle of the table that are, at best, completely useless, and at worst get in the way of the ball's path through obstacles. When the tables work, though, they work relatively well, with a fair amount of ramps and habitrails to keep them visually interesting. Goals on the tables seem sparse if not nonexistent, but for tables to just waste a few minutes with they could be worse. If there is one glaring gameplay shortcoming it's the lack of controller support, since I very much prefer to use a joypad when playing pinball games, but the controls the game uses by default are remappable on the keyboard and by default are quite similar to those featured in many other PC pinball titles.By far the game's biggest disappointment is in the audio department. While table sounds are okay, if a bit teensy in their clickiness and identical from table to table, the music featured on the tables ranges from forgettable to completely absent. Announcers have the same basic lines for the most part, with generic phrases often used when just a little more flavor could have gone a long way to improve the presentation of each table's theme. As a result the overall audio experience taken from each table is basically devoid of any kind of character and severely hurts the feel of the game.In the end, though, is Dream Pinball 3D worth the price?The answer is a resounding ""no."" At least, not full price. I picked the game up at a severe discount (67 cents I believe) and feel in no way cheated or disappointed in the product I received for that price. If the game were even only marginally cheaper -- 4.99, say -- I would feel that I could provide a recommendation just because the tables are, in fact, playable and it's obvious there was some effort put in to make the game worthwhile. At the game's default price of 6.99, however, you're better off just saving up another couple of bucks and investing in a starter set of tables from the likes of Pinball FX 2, or picking up one of the Pinball Arcade sets when they go on sale (as they frequently do.) At best, Dream Pinball 3D is a second or even third-tier pinball title, worth picking up at discount and for variety, but with little other reason to recommend it."

,Not Recommended,215790,29951156,Posted: 15 February,all,Raymond,"Dream Pinball 3D Review - Raymond KTDream Pinball 3D fails at reproducing realistic physics, rendering it pretty much useless. Even if the player was given a sense of the weight of the ball and the flippers reacted like they should, you'd still have some pretty generic tables.The table collection in Dream Pinball consists of a bunch of clichés and one ambiguous fantasy game. You've got your medieval table, your monster table, your dinosaur table… They're well thought out with the usual secrets, combos, and special modes, but they aren't inspired. The one machine that isn't easily described is Amber Moon, which appears to be a mishmash of sword and sorcery themes. A sexy witch/vampire lady adorns the table's artwork, but the standout sound effect is a bird call that doesn't sound mysterious or supernatural at all. Weird. Overall, the sound in Dream Pinball is pretty well done. Each table has its own soundtrack, appropriate sound effects, and a voice over giving you commentary.The first thing any pinball wizard will notice about this effort is the flippers are terrible. They aren't governed by physics at all. There are simply two flipper modes: up and down. Flipping them doesn't result in any movement; they are transported from a resting position to an upright position. This denies the player the ability to finesse their shots with varying degrees of strength.Also disappointing are the ball physics. The orbs don't feel like they have any weight to them. Each table has a ""ballchange"" feature that switches the material of your ball from steel to things like marble or walnut. The manual claims this will alter the weight and handling of your orbs, but in practice they don't feel any different. Sometimes it doesn't even feel like the ball is making contact with the flippers."

(However easily changed at start of table)This and some other small things make me unable to recommend this to a pinball enthusiast.Sum:Try it if you want, don’t have the exceptions I had.//vitloken"

I don't understand what all the whining and complaining is about. If you have a top of the line system and expect the latest in graphics resolution and the latest improvements in physics, then this game might not be for you....BUT if you can accept the fact that this game came out before all the newest in hardware advances and don't mind slightly lower graphics quality, the play is acceptable and there is nothing to complain about for the price paid. There are better pinball games available, but this one is fun to play even though it is not the best available."

The game has a handful operating operations,saveral distinctive table types&it recordes my high scores.I won't unload this game for a long time haaaaaa."
