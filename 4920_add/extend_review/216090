You take the role of a lil' gopher as he coordinates his friends to defend their BBQ from hungry dinosaurs. Tower placement is enhanced as each tower has a specific shape and size, requiring you to plan ahead and maximise space with optimal positioning. As the dinosaurs head towards your delicious steaks (or carrots, if you'd prefer!) you're tasked with collecting additional coconuts to create more towers or can even provide support and get involved in the defence itself.A little undercooked but still tasty and filling."

It has cute graphics, nice sound effects. Very polished game without any bugs. There is only one big problem - gameplay is boring. I will try to explain.- There are only 5 towers and 5 units in the first 20 levels.- The look of the levels is always the same. Only the road changes direction. There is always 1 road. Mobs go through themselves one by one from the point A to the point B. Every level...- There are no upgrades between levels. Actually, there is nothing between levels except new skins for main character- There are no difficulty levels. The only one is very very easy.- There are no types of damage/armor, no numerals of health and damage. There is no strategy. It's just another casual clicker gameI was forced by myself to reach World Two. I was hoping to see something new. I was wrong.There were same 1 road levels with another skin (it was a desert. WoW!).I wasted an hour of my life by playing this game.I think, people who never played TD games and children could find this game interesting.I can't recommend this game for anybody to buy even on a sale!"

,Recommended,216090,11679746,"Posted: 12 August, 2014",all,MrNinjaSquirrel,"I'm gonna level with you for a moment: I've never had a steak. Growing up with a vegetarian for a mother it was never on the menu, and for whatever reason I've never gone out of my way to eat one now I'm feeding myself. What I gather though is people go a little crazy for them, gophers too for that matter. So you can probably empathize with them when a group of dinosaurs show up to crash their barbecue, leaving no choice but to wage an all out war on the intruders trying to snatch up their lunch.Go Home Dinosaurs is then the chronicle of their grand struggle, playing out in the form of a cute and colorful tower defense game. If hearing that makes you groan as you remember the dozens of other TD games already in your library, I can relate, but to its credit GHD does a pretty good job of making itself stand apart (in both good and bad ways). The most obvious of these is its charming aesthetic, full of bobblehead characters bouncing around spouting off silly one liners as they proclaim their undying love for grilled cow.It also switches up the traditional way in which towers are selected and built, having you first choose cards for each of your towers, which come in various shapes and sizes requiring more forethought in how you plan to position them. This is cool in that it makes each stage feel like a bit of a puzzle, with the towers being the missing pieces you have to try and squeeze in correctly, but it also takes out a large amount of the strategy found in more traditional TD games. Because levels are so tightly wound, it also feels as if there is already a predesignated layout and you are simply trying to figure out what that is. This might not be readily apparent during the first few levels of the game, but pretty soon the difficulty takes a huge spike upwards and makes it almost a requirement to use a select few towers that were seemingly handpicked for a given level.I was also disappointed with how shallow the mechanics are, with no leveling system for towers, or even the ability to remove towers after you've placed them. Being able to only place a very small number of towers and having to pick them all from the start also created more than a few frustrating moments when I completely ran out or chose more towers than I'd have any hope of placing, as it's difficult to judge any of this before you actually play a level for yourself.All the same Go Home Dinosaurs is certainly enjoyable, largely thanks to how adorable it is. If you are looking for a deep and strategic tower defense game, you aren't going to find it here, but what you will is a bunch of ridiculous anthropomorphic gophers cracking jokes and making pop culture references as bands of dinos poor out of caves with the sort of stupid expressions you'd expect from steak obsessed reptiles. If that sounds amusing to you don't hesitate to pick the game up, but if your already shuddering at the thought of their squeaky voices I'd steer clear."

If you think along the same lines, don't stop reading and don't ignore this title. Go Home Dinosaurs! is probably one of the most rewarding games available on Steam and probably one of the best titles to start out with the genre. It has a variety of difficult angles, challening corners, and heart-pounding timing to save your BBQ from threatening Dinos! If the storyline sounds totally ridiculous, just wait until you put a DJ booth down and destroy a dozen Compy via the power of your record scratching. It's supposed to be ridiculous, and loves to point that out about itself! It's a perfect little title to pass the time or bring yourself into a genre you've never thought you'd have the patience for. It has its challenges, but it wouldn't be fun otherwise! Here's your chance to go back in time and send those Dinos home! I highly recommend Go Home Dinosaurs! whatever type of gamer you are."

There is almost zero opportunities for replay-ability but there is a real solid single player experience here.

Nothing groundbreaking mechanically but being forced to plan your tower placement before the level begins is a unique challenge and the different shapes of the towers is the real source of the fun for me. It's definitley easy for the first dozen levels and some of the voice work can be grating after the 30th time. Don't be afraid to snag this game for yourself or any young children who like games like Plants Vs Zombies or Kingdom Rush.

Console port, shallow recycled tower defense mechanic stolen mainly from PVZ but 3D instead of left-to-right. No actual hotkeys that I can figure out. No fast forward. Dinosaurs are cute and the game has cute attitude, at least. For 2 dollars I can't complain, which is the only reason I recommend it. For 2 dollars it's worth it IF you like tower defense games AND you want to see a pink female Triceratops named Tina wearing winter snow booties whilst skipping through the snow. If this describes you then for 2 dollars you might check it out.PS: I must also mention that the entire game premise of ""defending your steak BBQ from dinosaurs that are invading your picnic like gigantic ants"" has a Vegetarian Mode involving carrots. The lack of Tofu Steaks highly annoys me, but the fact that it still has steaks on the loading screen is -unforgivable-.INTERNET PETITION RDY GO KTHX I DEMAND A REFUND"

The humor is hit and miss, but i get the feeling it may be aiming for a younger audience. Unlike most TD this one is perfectly suited for childrens as there is no real violence or even gore. The games otherwise play well with a decent choice of towers and the rare mechanic of controlling a main character who also count as a mobile tower on it's own, a bit like Anomaly. If you are a big TD fan it's worth a try at least, but do expect a simpler friendly game.-Lost"
,Recommended,216090,24389591,"Posted: 18 July, 2016",all,osirish,"Go Home Dinosaurs is an action/tower defense game with puzzle and card game elements. You unlock various towers as you progress through the levels in the form of cards, and before every new level, must choose a set of cards from your collection for use within the level.Each card (tower) requires resources, which are coconuts and they spawn at random times throughout the level, meaning that you are constantly watching for the next coconut tree in order to gather resources so you can place your towers.The ""action"" element comes from not only having to click coconuts, but clearing boulders and knocking down snowmen on some levels to make room for towers, and all while trying to get your squirrel into position to do damage when it's not collecting resources/clearing terrain as your main character also functions as a mobile tower.It's not a traditional tower defense game, it requires much more hands on and faster reactions than most. There's no planning in advance, the dinosaurs travel along predetermined paths, so there's also a puzzle element regarding which tower cards to choose to be most effective on any particular level. It's well presented cartoon graphic style and sound effects are enjoyable.The only negative I have is that even though I love tower defense games, this was a little too much action and not enough strategy. If you like TD games, I advise watching some gameplay videos on youtube before you make a purchase as it might not be what you are expecting."
,Recommended,216090,34790979,Posted: 7 September,all,Karma,"Go Home Dinosaurs mixes tower-defense with tetris-like towers. I like this because you then have to plan what towers to use on which level, some you like may not be able to fit on some levels, this actually makes sure all towers are used and not just a select few.It runs very well, the cutscenes are cute and I am having a blast with the levels.Achievements are not hard to get, I assume they have lower-clear rate because people got bored of the game as I do feel the first few levels are slow because of the lack of towers unlocked but any tower-defense game has this so I do not mind it. Bear through the first few slow levels and then the fun starts once you unlock more towers.You can use new towers in earlier levels too which is nice as often tower-defense games don't allow you to do this.Only issue with the game is the characters voice, however you can turn that off in options so thank you developers.It is fun, however maybe not as fun as other's in the same genre so I would wait for a discount unless you really like what you see if you watch some videos."

Towers are all shaped differently and each level is designed in ways to make the player figure out how to place the towers in the limited spaces. There's a couple of active elements to the game as well, you have a main character who can attack enemies in a small aoe around him (an extremley useful tactic if you're going for 3 stars on each level) and collect coconuts, which are the resource for the game.I have two issues with the game - One, it's a bit too easy. I three starred every level with little difficulty.  Two, there's very little dinosaur variety. Asides from bosses and one or so regular enemy, the only differences between the enemies are their HP and speed, which is quite disappointing when compared to other TDs.

A unique take on the genre, you get to control one main character, collecting coconuts as you go to buy the towers to defend your grill.  (Really.)  The spin on it though is that the towers you place are Tetris style blocks, so you have to plan ahead to get the most of the available space you have.

Once you're done with all games and levels, that's that. There aren't any additional puzzles or game modes to play, which means that I was already done after 17 hours with no reason to return (I already went for all 3 steaks/carrots). This could have been a 5/5 if it offered something to return to. The way it is, I would probably give it a 4/5, as it is still very addictive while it lasts."

Everything that is enjoyable about the usual defense gameplay is startlingly absent in this one.I know on Steam there's a general attitude of ""dude, shut up, it only cost $2"" but the fact is, I have a few TD games on my mobile phone that cost less and gave me hours of interesting gameplay."

Dinosaurs walk a linear, unalterable path towards their goal.  Before the start of each level, the player have to choose a set amount of cards, which will represent what the player will be able to purchase during the duration of the level.  The player uses cocounts (currency) to purchase permanent installations (gunners, traps), power-ups, and bombs (as represented by cards).  The player is mobile across the board, collects coconuts from trees, and can fire upon the dinosaurs freeley within range.  The foundations of the installations have tetris-esque shapes, which you need to fit around the shape of the path.  There are a good amount of variation of dinosaurs the players will face, all with variations of speed and armor (no attacks).  Controls are very simple, only using a mouse and a spacebar.That being said, the game is very cartoonish, making a strong appeal towards a younger audience.  Don't be fooled though.  The later levels are very puzzling and require a good amount of finess (I stress finess more than puzzle detail).  The overall difficulty is definitely harder than Plants vs. Zombies (coming from a guy who broke level 100 in PvZ survival).  For those who really love the challenge, there are Steam achievements for completing certain levels using only specific cards.  Even with the high difficulty factor, I still encourage anyone (seriously, anyone) who loves tower defense games (or just PvZ) to play it.  It really is a fun casual game."

The gameplay here is what kills it. It is incredibly slow to play. Unlike most tower defense games now there is no speed up button to advance gameplay forward at a faster pace. So because of this you are forced to trudge through slow moving enemies advancing forward. You also can not upgrade the towers you do build and are forced to find places to put them since they all take up different amounts of spaces and angles.You also control the main character himself who can go around throwing coconuts at the enemy. The main problem with this game though is just the lack of fun I found myself not having while playing it. Between the slow gameplay and the fact that the game provided little challenge I just found myself growing bored too quickly with not much in game to keep me wanting to advance into the further stages.Overall there are hundreds and thousands of better tower defense games out there one could play. This one is lacking gameplay features and fun factor while being made for a younger crowd.

It's an adept time-killer for short burst play and there's a large pause button in the top left of the screen.For a quick synopsis of the plot itself, you're one gopher in a large clan of gophers and you're having a barbecue. Your neighboring dinosaurs weren't invited this time so they've decided to simply crash the party. This turns the encounter into a tower defense scenario where you and your fellows do what you can to protect long hordes of dinos from eating your food.The method is a bit different from other TD games in that the ""towers"" you place are shaped a bit like Tetris/puzzle pieces, so there's some fun behind where you place your gopher pals along the track the dinos use to reach the grill.Dinosaurs! is pretty enjoyable and cute. The voices from the towers you place (all of them some kind of device staffed by one or more gophers) become grating toward the end of the game, and there are strange spikes in difficulty if you dedicate yourself to only one technique to win. You'll find a few towers function much better than others but don't let that stop you from trying every one.I bought this in a sale bundle and spent a little over a dollar on it, and got more than my money's worth.

If you can get the game on sale, you will get it at $2.50 - then I need 3 copies because I like to vet the games first - then little brother CANNOT miss out on what big brother has.  Anyway this game has been very good value for the kids.""Tower defense"" is the proper name for this type of game - that means stop the baddies reaching your castle/home/nest- or in this case barbecue.  The baddies in this game are cutsie dinosaurs.  The kids earn coins during the game which they can spend in the in-game shop (no real money changes hands) mostly to buy new outfits for their character.  The shop keeper is comic - I was really caught on the back foot when my son asked what moustache wax was - he had heard ""shoppy"" say that that was not for sale!I used to be quite an accomplished Gamer back when everything was coin operated - not so much now.  I disagree with those that say this game is ""easy"" and ""basic"".  It can get quite hard, and my kids did get frustrated at points, retrying the same level (they DO have the choice to just go play another level, which is great).  It was interesting to see strategies emerge - you can let dinosaurs reach your barbie twice - only on the the third time do you lose the level.  One of my sons rigorously defends his barbecue from all-comers.  My other son concentrates on building his defences and only goes all out to defend the barbie on the third time around.Another tower defence game that a lot of kids play is plants versus zombies.  Both games have their merits - and PVZ is certainly a lot more well known.  I would say Go Home Dinosaurs is a lot more parent-acceptable.This game will keep them entertained for hours during those cold winter months (I write this from Australia) until we actually start having real barbecues again.

I have to say that i didn't spend that whole time playing, but I'm pretty sure it has something 'bout 20 hours to reach all the achievements if you are not as slow as me.I let the original review below, without any changes. I really loved to play the game. Very simple, but very fun.-----------------------------------------ORIGINAL:I'm still running after some achievements, but I can already say that this is a good game. I got it some days ago, in a Summer sale. It was very cheap for the amount of fun that I took from this game.First of all, you need to like Tower Defense games, but you don't need to be a very strategic person, since this game doesn't have a lot of units and enemies. It's simple, but it's still very cool to play, specially if you're looking for a game to chill and have a break sometimes.The achievements are not very hard to obtain, which is not actually something bad, since the game is supposed to be short.Although it's short, it has very unique and well made graphics, with some cute units, while the sound effects are Ok, nothing special about it. At least the sounds from the units are funny.The game itself is very simillar to Plants vs. Zombies, which I love and played a lot. So if you like that game, you'll probably like this one too.Overall: 8.5/10. It could be longer, with some more difficult and different modes.Anyway, I would recommend to anyone who's looking for some cheap, fun, simple and relaxing game. Give it a try!"

One of my biggest gripes for tower games is everything is so small and cluster-♥♥♥♥ed on the map, sometimes I can't even see the creeps through all the tower projectiles. That's no problem for Go Home Dinosaurs! I see a lot of reviews saying this game is too easy. World one is pretty much a tutorial until level 12 or 14. It's pretty much: New tower, here's a couple levels with obvious placement choice- new tower.. ETC. After that, the difficulty increases, and the maps are less obvious. You need to actually look at the map, see what towers you should take and how you're going to space them before every map begins. That's TRUE strategy! I just failed a level 3 times in a row on the second world, until i finally found a tower set up that worked. It was fun trying new combinations based on the squares I had available. Also, it's super cute! 10/10!"
