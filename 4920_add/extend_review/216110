Overall it looked GREAT but the controls, since this was ported over from a touch interface, were a bit lacking. After the publisher read so many comments about this short-coming they added the ability to use keyboard / mouse for controlling your characters. I would have preferred Twin-Stick controls but I'll take what I can get here. :)After the update I have been loving this game greatly. Game loads quick, gameplay itself is quick to pick up, and the graphics are, cartoony but, fantastic.If you enjoy leading some characters around shooting and blasting things you'll have a great time with this title. Also, since everyone must join the bandwagon (and I, for one, love them for it), this game also includes a zombie survival mode. Maps are a bit small for my tastes and it gets a bit hectic sometimes leading your ""snake"" of men through the environment and zombies, but overall a ton of fun.In summation, buy this game (on sale or full price) today and support a developer providing great games, and, who listens to their player-base."
,Not Recommended,216110,16901119,"Posted: 5 July, 2015",all,Selenography,"It pains me slightly to give this a negative review, but it just isn't quite good enough to justify the endorsement. It's not a bad game by any stretch, more mediocre than anything else - and it may appeal to big fans of the genre. I just wasn't particularly taken by it.Although it's an iOS port, Tiny Troopers is far from poor and the dev deserves props for patching in some additional control options to overcome teething problems left over from the initial touch interface. A small thing, but always good to see. The game plays exactly as you think a casual topdown shooter would - you track through relatively simple missions with your squad, following along in a string ala Cannon Fodder. Unfortunately, the similarities pretty much end there.There are quite a few missions in the game and trying to get three stars on all of them would be a reasonable challenge by the standards of an iOS game, even if they do get samey fairly swiftly. The zombie defense mode is also surprisingly fun for a little while. The graphics are cute and the humour is there, at the very least - the game seems reminiscent of the 3D Worms games in both senses.Ultimately though, what's fun for an hour or two quickly gets stale - and that's why I can't recommend this game. Worth picking up on sale if you like the genre, but otherwise this one seems destined to clutter bundles. Tiny Troopers, I salute you for your efforts but I can't banish Cannon Fodder from my mind. Perhaps that's on me and I shouldn't be making so many comparisons, but that's just how I feel. It suffers the same fate as the numerous Lemmings clones have over the years - even today, they suffer by comparison to the original."

Chose this game (thanks Josh) installed it, and felt like it was going to be another one of those budget pieces of crap.I could not have been further off base with that assumption.You begin each mission with a brief overview of your objectives. You get to see your squad, and how many people you will be bringing along for the mission. You can buy single mission upgrades, as well as training that lasts from mission to mission. Once you have selected your squad loadout, and upgrades, you begin.Cute, colorful graphics work well, along with some nice explosion effects. Purposely cartoony sound effects and voice acting fit the theme.  Varied mission objectives keep it interesting. Default controls are completely mouse driven, and are terrible. Switch over to WSAD movement and mouse controlled firing, and it controls perfectly.$5 for this hidden gem. Wait for it to be on sale if you must, but Id pick it up at full price. Awesome."

So, if you were thrown off from buying this game because of older reviews that were posted before the changes were made (such as TotalBuiscuit's review), please consider trying the current version on sale, it is freshly polished and has been vastly improved.Tiny Troopersis a lot of fun, the Command Point system along with the Ranking and Leveling add a nice touch to make the game feel a bit more progressive. Individual trooper levelling makes a return and works essentially the same way as it does in the originalCannon Foddergames, each mission a particular trooper survives and completes will provide them with a new rank making them tougher, stronger and improve his weapon capabilities.There are a total of 30 missions in the campaign, 10 missions per chapter. Once these are complete, there is aCampaign+option to try and challenge yourself further giving this game some replay value, the Zombie mode is a nice touch too to give yourself something more to do.There isn't much else to say here. The game is really enjoyable, while not exactly groundbreaking, and is a great game to play if you're looking to get into something quick and fun for a low price. It takes no time at all to get yourself clued up on how to play as the tutorial takes no longer than a minuteto complete because of the simple controls, meaning you can jump right into the action almost instantly. Also just for the record, this game is superior toCannon Fodder 3.For £3.99, I defeinitely recommend this game. When it is on sale, I can't recommend this game enough."

You survive for a while. You unlock a gate. You get a new troop. You get some drops. You survive more. You unlock more gates. You get more troops. You survive even more. You unlock no more gates.

You'll get frustrated almost completing a mission then getting blown to bits by a tank you didn't see or walked into some hidden explosives.

There are several control schemes to choose from and the controls are done well and shouldn't be a problem for anyone.  The Zombie mode is made up of one map and you unlock gates that lead to the other members of your team, and as you piece together this team you fight off waves of several types of zombies including chickens and kamikazis to name a few. I have enjoyed my time with this game and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good romp through a series of small battles with a handful of destructive weapons and units at their disposal."

The only thing that is remotely worthwhile is the shooting part of the game, which is maybe 6/10.My biggest gripe is that you need to control all of your soldiers in a brainless snake-like chain.  Why?  This is not how soldiers would behave in a hail of gunfire.  I couldn't even bring myself to finish the game.It does just enough right but only barely.  Buy it only on sale.

76561197994124281,Not Recommended,216110,33158961,Posted: 2 July,all,SGR,"Can be fun (though never great), but let down by poor implementation of so many features. The upgrade / spending system is one example, with upgrades costing a lot but only existing for one mission. Missions with journalists are infuriating because they wander randomly into the line of fire, making it possible to fail even if you have done nothing wrong. Worse, failing means restarting without any upgrades you bought - in the worst situations this makes the level physically impossible to complete (e.g. you must destroy a tower but have no rockets and have no cash to buy any). Moving downwards is difficult because the UI obscures a large chunk of the play area. Given that enemies can see and fire at you from the very edge of the screen, this is a major oversight. The play area should start from above the UI panel. Performance is also very poor given the (not particularly complex) graphics."

Missions on maximum difficulty can be completed effortlessly the first time you see them, provided everyone but your main unit means nothing to you. I'm guessing that the ""challenge"" is that you can only control the head of your squad and all other members move like a snake behind him. Therefore, when you are trying to avoid fire, you have to do so in a way that does not allow the other members of your party to get hit when they arrive at your location two or three seconds later. Basically, it's inevitable that your main unit will be grossly overpowered and everyone else will be new and inexperienced.Really, I would sum this game up by saying it's just not very good and be done with it. However, it's struck me right from the main menu that this is intended to be something like 3D, isometric Call of Duty for eight year olds. I don't really mean that in a condescending way, and this isn't really a game that I'd give and eight year old to play unless I was trying to explain military strategy of the Iraq war (run in with thousands of troops, shoot up locals, watch your troops die, and accomplish nothing yet make a lot of money). But really, the maturity level conveyed and depth from the game definitely makes me think ages 8 - 10 and lord knows I can think of better options than this for somebody's childhood."

Given it is a very small area you are fighting in, this is an artificial constraint built in.Campaign: Money is the lifeblood of the game, so when you run out of money, it's game over. So why the developers decided to slug you $50 every time you kill a chicken is beyond me. ARE YOU TRYING TO TAKE THE FUN OUT OF THE GAME ???Oh, more artificial contrainsts  - escorting NPC's means not deviating AT ALL, or they die. To add insult to injury, you lose $500.This makes sense in a game with IAP, to encourage players to buy more coin, but as there is none in this version, SO WHY ♥♥♥♥ING HAVE IT ?If your team gets killed - too bad. No replaying the mission, revives, nothing. So you make a mistake that wipes out your uber promoted soldier ? Too ♥♥♥♥ing bad. Yes, I know it is the same in the iOS version but does it *have* to be ?There are many things they could have done to make TT a much better game on PC, but instead it's just a cheap cash in with most of the fun cut out of it.Stick to the iPhone version - it's more fun, has more uniforms and gear.

The gameplay is very similar to Foreign Legion: Buckets of Blood, but I found Tiny Troopers to be much more fun. During the short 3 chapter campaign, you accumulate points to spend on non-permanent upgrades including a specialist soldier. During the missions, you pickup usable items like grenades, RPGs, and air strikes. Then you collect medals to spend on permanent recruitment upgrades. Your characters gain experience as long as you keep them alive; if they die, you get new fresh troops. The game does lack controller support which would make the gameplay even better, but you can't go wrong for $2. Did I mention the endless zombie survival mode?"

,Not Recommended,216110,28289135,"Posted: 10 December, 2016",all,ZenosyX,"Pretty goofy and fairly relaxing game, definitely something I can see casual gamers enjoy.There is a bit of a puzzle aspect to it in some degree while completing missions through obtaining certain tools required and/or decide what to bring for the mission. But overall it has for me mostly been either a test of patience to take a mission in my own pace and attempt to beat it without any upgrades for more challenge while making sure every soldier stay alive, or grinding up some cash to buy all upgrades and try to stomp the missions head on.Once you figure out a few mechanics it's mostly played on ""autopilot"" (meaning: doesn't require much thinking at all) besides the occasional times you need certain tools and take certain routes to make it a bit easier for yourself. But even those can most of the time be dealt with straight on if you want to and understand the game mechanics well enough to use them for your advantage. It is far from a difficult game, and I only tried it on the hardest difficulty when trying to get a feel of what the game was like.In my personal opinion, this game could have been more optimized and they could have made several mechanics much smoother, but overall it is somehow pretty charming with its goofy graphics, sounds and silly comments here and there. It's not really a bad game, it just simply isn't made for me.I really don't think this is a game people should buy unless it is on sale or if they notice that the genre suit them too good to pass up on it. However, if you just want a relaxing way to kill time and it's on a big sale then who knows?On a sidenote: they should really fix the duplication glitch where you are able to bring two specialists to a mission. I found it by accident and realized it had a 100% chance to occur during certain circumstances. It really takes the fun out of the game when it happens... and the fact that you are able to do it really easy intentionally can probably make some people unable to avoid abusing it, which may ruin their experience with it."

76561198047455459,Recommended,216110,15144370,"Posted: 31 March, 2015",all,Spectre,"Though not a perfect game by any means it's hard to really chastise it when the game only costs 0.99.  My verdict is this: If you're looking for an easy to learn, basic mechanic top down shooter then you will definitely enjoy this game but if you go into it looking for a well thought out deep tactical experience, one might find themselves a little disappointed. The mechanics are very simple, you lead a squad (every member of your squad automatically follows the unit you control so no worries about micro or positioning) and complete objectives based on each level (this is typically ""kill all enemy units"", or escort ""unit A to point B"" typ stuff) while along the way there are hidden items that will allow you to purchase temporary upgrades and equiptment for your men at the end of each level. However you also have to ability to call in med kits, grenades, and other equiptment at any point during a mission so as long as you don't get completely surrounded you can almost always keep your men alive.The game's squad tries to take on an Xcom style approach where as a soldier completes missions and survives he will get promoted with gives him a series of buffs and enhancements. Similarly however if a soldier dies he is gone for good and is replaced with a lower ranking soldier. This part can be very frustrating since there is no save option during the campaign so if one your men dies he's gone no matter what. To make up for this though the player can replay individual missions of the campaign and receive a seperate squad of soldiers than his main campaign squad.The combat is very basic. Youre squad follows you in a line, you Point and click to shoot, no cover, no ammo, no changing positions. Certain items like armor and grenades can be purchased between missions to add some variables into how the combat will play out.The graphics are pretty well done even though i'm almost convinced it uses the same engine as Diablo or Torchlight. The sound effects and voice acting are all intentionally cheesy and exagerated which suits the light heartedness of the game very well. All in all the asking price is pretty fair and if you're into top down point and click shooters or MOBA style combat then you will definitely get some enjoyment out of this game."

Brilliant!But Tiny Troopers has NO joystick support! Why not?! It would be perfect!So we are forced to click to move, click to shoot, and dart the mouse back and forth as we do so.

I love the look and controls of this game. They're incredibly easy to get used to and the leveling up system is both simplistic while being incredibly efficient. It also gives you a reason not to let your men die, especially high ranking members of your team as once they're dead, they're gone for good and you're graced with a new troop with a new name and no level ups. Its hours of fun and the prospect of losing men in war is heightened in this game due to the finality of it. Kind of like in Final Fantasy Tactics if you've ever played that game.

I wish there was a way to switch off the voices as hearing the same pipsqueak voice yelling ""die!"" and ""get some!"" gets old very quickly.6/10"
,Recommended,216110,396006,"Posted: 24 August, 2012",all,ICS,"More like Cannon Fodder than Cannon Fodder 3! When your squad members die, they die so there is no reload from last state and start again. So if you have Staff sergeant in your squad, keep him alive if you can!Good game, just that for more efficient combat, it would need aswd movement. Right now you just point and click while you shoot. This leads to casualties and makes higher difficulty settings not fun to play at all. Developers should add aswd movement option for the PC, even though this is originally made for some handheld devices."

It's only very hard to keep playing this game. The story mode is really short, and then the only thing that is left to do is zombie mode, which is very fun.Overal, this game has no storyline, just a few seperate stories, The graphics are not good and not bad, but still it brought me 8 hours of fun."

Guide them through 30 deadly missions with varied objectives: destroy enemy armoured formations, save hostages and eliminate enemy generals, to name but just a few.Your troopers will face enemy infantry, snipers, technicals and even tanks. The casualty rate is going to be high but there’s an endless supply of fresh recruits to step up and fill the ranks. Those lucky troopers who survive from mission to mission will be promoted, and each new stripe they gain makes them tougher.To increase your troopers’ chances of survival, use Command Points to give them better equipment, reinforce their team with a specialist like machine gunner, medic or delta force and call in support drops during missions.

It was fun, but also brutal at times. You cared about the soldiers you leveled up and felt sad when they died. It was (is) a video game classic.Tiny Troopers lacks the original's humility, irony, satire, level design, strategic thinking and artistic variation. It also misses a few key features from the original (splitting troops, vehicles, hidden mines, graveyard) BUT it's quite a fun clone to play, so I'm recommending it if you get it on sale."
