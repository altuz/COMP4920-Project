It's short, it's got an overly complicated plot line and just doesn't have the charm of the first two games. Not to mention the ending involved watching a 5 second long cut scene and finding out what happened after the end of the game with some images and text. Then, for no reason other than to add some 'levity' they tagged on a terrible 'outtake' reel. It fell right through the ice and died a death. At the moment, I'm not looking forward to 4/Sam Peters and I'm starting to think Deep Silver are giving up on point-n-click adventures. I'd think it was a damn shame if this game wasn't so half-hearted."

Recommended for 5 Euro or lessPros:Decent voice acting– third time around they’ve finally managed to get it more or less right.Very nice backgrounds and some interesting camera anglesMostly logical puzzlesGood musicCons:Character animations for performing actions – or actually lack of it. It’s really big downgrade since previous installmentsPlot-wise its weakest of the threeVery week secondary characters that shows up suddenly and disappear after few moments (without a chance to hold decent conversation)Character models better than in predecessors but still below averageMuch shorter than the other two (gameplay around 6-7 hours) – not a problem for me but I think it’s worth mentioning

At least they replaced the annoying voice actors, but otherwise the game felt way too run-of-the-mill and rushed. The story doesn't make much sense, skips exposition when it wants to and ends very suddenly. Yes, we finally get at least some kind of answers, but at least I thought those answers were pretty dumb. It's a better game than the suckadelic Part Two, but still a good measure below average."

,Not Recommended,216210,1449170,"Posted: 5 January, 2013",all,Tb,"This is a bad game. I hate to say this, but this is a bad game and an even worse adventure game.I still like Nina and Max is alright, but it was a struggle to power on through this game. Most of the situations are totally abstract which the developers use to excuse their needlessly odd solutions to puzzles. The ""minigames"" all have the option of easy or difficult. Easy is tedious and boring and difficult is the same, but you have to do it longer. Oh and this game is weird.I sigh, but I suppose if you are a Secret Files fan, like myself, you will buy this game anyway, but if you're looking for a good adventure game and figure this is a recent one from a company with a pedigree, it's a mistake. Take a look at The Next Big Thing or Deponia instead."

Very short (took me less than 4 hours, not counting replaying a major part of the game after a crash), annoying and repetitive mini games. Some fun moments, but doesn't get anywhere close to Secret Files 1 and 2."
,Recommended,216210,15491558,"Posted: 22 April, 2015",all,Student Maniac,It's not a bad game and its a good continuation of the first game secret files: Tunguska but I think it could have been longer considering my first play though of it was under 3 hours and the first game (which I had on disk before I got a steam account) took me a good couple of weeks of play.Despite its short run it is a good game to play and the voice acting in this one compared to the other two is I think spot on.

,Not Recommended,216210,8064612,"Posted: 16 December, 2013",all,Ashes,"This is easily the weakest of the SF + Lost Hirozon games. Ironically, playing this games demo was what made me buy them in the first place, as I really enjoyed the point and click puzzle solving.There are many complaints I have about this game as I felt very dissapointed compared to the first two. They really took away the good things about the earlier games and tried to drag out this short and unoriginal story the easiest way possible.The mini-games in this game are tedious and boring. One of these include trying to steer a vehicle that is barely responsive due to the awkward stop-and-go animation. The vehicle has to navigate an area where a single missclick sends it rushing the wrong way and sometimes it's hard to tell how to make it go the direction you want to. The area you use the vehicle is very dark and not always easy to tell where the vehicle can stand.The second being a random duel where the enemy is drastically overpowered, forcing you to waste time on repairing your own unit. Nothing you do is anywhere near effective as the enemy. The second problem being that attacking and defending is completely random. There is no pattern you can follow, you just click some buttons, hope for the best, then waste some minutes on repairing and going through Nina's whiny dialogue. And what baring on the plot does this duel have? None! It's never mentioned again and quite frankly, the game could have advanced without it.The story was a huge mess. What I liked about Nina is that you could relate to her because she's just like anyone else. She doesn't have superpowers. She is not some overdramatic contribution to the plot. All she did in the other games were trying to uncover the truth.In this game, that changes completely. Nina has too much involvement on the plot making her seem like a supernatural creature. It takes away a lot of her character. A big part of the game doesn't even take place in reality, she ends up in some form of dream-reality state where, for whatever reason, she can dream about the past and find out facts which helps her in the  present day. It's just very over the top.The story is also very short. I ended this game at half the time I spent on the two first games. The game also stalls you at several points in the game. At one point, Nina has to find out where a person goes and the only way she can do so, is using various items to keep up. If she discovers he got lost, she gets teleported back to the very beginning and you have to run all the way back before you can continue. You can't bypass this either, even if you are standing at the very location you want to continue, Nina have to be teleported back to the start after ""realizing"" she needs to do something else. So you run all the way back there, she completes one step, realizes she has to do something more and gets teleported all the way back again. And you have to do this about five times in a row. Why oh why can't you simply start in the room before? She needs to do nothing in the previous rooms except run through them. So you are just wasting your time by running back there. And if that wasn't frustrating enough, it is very easy to figure out where to go next. So you spend half a minute in the actual room, but you spend almost five minutes runing back to work on your progress.As for the puzzle solving, I thought that the rooms and clues were too confined. You usually have only 2-3 rooms to work with, as well as only a few items to use. The last part of the game was so easy that I was surprised the game ended so quickly. In the last 5 rooms of the game, I don't recall using more than 2-3 items per room. This is a huge letdown compared to the first game where you were controlling two different characters, using many different items throughout a whole building.Appearently this game has several different endings. And I ended up with the worst possible outcome. The ending also starts  very abruptly. Kind of like watching some generic princess story, where the prince says ""I will resque her!"" and then the credits roll, with an announcement that the prince decided to go on a new adventure after rescuing the princess. So the question would obviously be, what happened when he resqued her? Why didn't he stay with her or the happily ever after stuff?Obviously a huge chunk of dialogue and plot development goes missing with such a timeskip. I was left scratching my head as to why things ended the way they did, as that wasn't the implication given just before the credits started rolling. And it literally bummed me out that I had wasted so much time on this plot only do be given a ""Whatever"" type of ending.What can I say that is good about the game? Well... the graphics are still nice. Many well done cutscenes and some of the scenarios in the game were fun to solve. I'd actually say that the demo showed the better parts of the game, then it goes downhill after that. The demo had some great puzzle solving and also a lot of tension, which I missed in the game.This isn't a game I would recommend, unless you find it on sale for very cheap. It's fine to play through once, but I don't look forward to doing it anytime soon. The first game is superior in a lot of ways to this."

I have played the two first games of the series and remember them as decent enough to buy this one, but I will not come back for more. Voice acting is mediocre at best, so the only ok part of this game is the graphics which is nice I guess. Spend your money on a better game. If you want to try an Animation Arts game try Lost Horizon. It's not perfect either but I didn't start thinking I was wasting my time halfway through like with this one. I did complete this one, but it just got worse and the end is a true anticlimax - like they suddenly just decided to stop working on it and instead making a quick end to it so they could start selling instead..."

,Recommended,216210,19326251,"Posted: 27 November, 2015",all,Bob,"This game was fine.  If there was an option between recommend and don't recommend, I'd pick it.The voice cast was fine (unlike in the second installment).  The story was interesting, but towards the end, you realize that they really needed a science advisor.  (If they hadn't messed up the science so badly, I'd probably be recommending it more wholeheartedly, but ultimately, I did enjoy it.  If you aren't too bothered by things like the fact that in their world nitrogen is apparently toxic and other science screw ups I can't talk about without spoiling stuff, then maybe you'll enjoy it at least as much as I did.)The puzzles and game play, I liked.  The difficulty was pretty enjoyable, and, importantly, it avoided annoying game logic and kept the puzzle logic actually fairly logical.  Once or twice, I got held up and it took awhile to get unstuck, but I managed without a walkthrough or any external help, which made me happy.Some reviewers have complained that it was too short.  I spent about twice as long in the second installment, but in that game, there were multiple times I was just frustrated that I couldn't skip ahead to something actually interesting.  So, yes, this is shorter, but I'm not unhappy about it.So, overall, I'm glad I didn't pay full price, and you can probably find better games out there, but I kind of wanted to finish the series (or at least the trilogy) and this was fine."

Following stupid story lines and combining random items to do even dumber tasks. Like with the first one, combining a bag and a broom to catch a cat in a tree but holy cow is this one unplayable. 90% of my time ""playing"" this is just switching between the ""game"" and walkthrough to find out what asinine objects to combine to further the so called plot. I just spent 30 minutes going back in time and doing the same♥♥♥♥♥♥over and over because I'm in a dream. If me playing this is a dream, then its a goddamn nightmare. Save yourself the time, save yourself the money. Don't even wait until it's on sale. This game isn't worth $10 let alone $0.01.
