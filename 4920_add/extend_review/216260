,Recommended,216260,13595249,"Posted: 25 December, 2014",all,RugePlus,"It's rare to find a decent Cricket game since the mid-90s to mid-2000s. During this time it was a battle of two publishers: Electronic Arts and Codemasters. Early iterations of the game were fun and lacked the realism that most sports games demand. If you're considering DBC 14 I also recommend searching for EA's Cricket 96 (PC) or Codemaster's Shane Warne Cricket 99 (PS1) on eBay.But back to more current matters. DBC 14 is by far the most authentic cricket game since the EA Sports release of Cricket 2005 for the PC and PS2. Running the game for the first time, you are met with an update that thankfully changes all player names to real names. I hope to see an update in the future that contains real stadium names too. Once in the game, you have various game options from 5-over a side to full blown test cricket. You can also create yourself and move up the ranks of world cricket.The practice arena is great too, reminiscent of a training nets session. From time to time I find myself relaxing in the nets just having a hit. I've only accumulated a few hours on the PC version but I did so, migrating from the XBOX 360 version. DBC 14 has a solid frame rate and feels very smooth. One aspect that still needs improving is the commentary. While not bad, it's not great. It's certainly not as annoying as other sports games (like PES) but not as smooth or free flowing.I love the camera angles in this game. When playing solo, you are shown your player from the 3rd person perspective. While this is standard fare for bowling in all cricket games, it's quite refreshing for batting and makes the game feel more authentic. Fielding is decent too and the camera angles during play are superb.At the time of writing this, I'm in search for games during the Steam sale. However I was quite willing to drop the full price for this game for two reasons: Supporting not just a local developer, but one that is willing to put the time and effort to capture a sport that itself has captured millions around the world."

Don Bradman Cricket 14 is very challenging no matter the difficultly, and when you win you feel a real sense of achievement. Avid cricket fans will love this, as there is so much to it. It's as much a cricket simulation as there might ever be.Well done, Big Ant Studios."

Just starting out in a career as a 16 year old fast bowler/batsman. The ability to simulate the game until it is your turn to bat or bowl is good if you don't want to sit around and watch the others pile on the runs while you sit in the pavilion waiting your turn.Big thumbs up to Big Ant Studios for producing an amazing game.If you love Cricket then this is a must, if you don't this is still a great sports game and a great way to set foot in the the amazing sport."
,Recommended,216260,12495236,"Posted: 14 October, 2014",all,Martin,"Arguably the best Cricket game ever, and I've played many. If not, it's certainly near the top.Nice graphics, excellent gameplay, patches released on a regular basis. There is realism, depth (batting especially will take a little while to get the hang of), and room for the community to step in and create players, teams and umpires. And there is a long-awaited CAREER MODE, where you start as a 16 year old and work your way up from County/State/Province-level to International selection.There isn't a large amount of stadia, but this is to be expected of a first release. Clearly gameplay has been the focus and DBC14 is better for it.In my opinion, DBC14 is worthy of the 'Don Bradman' branding. Well done Big Ant on hitting this one for six.P.S. You will need a controller, which I think is a good move, I couldn't imagine playing this on a keyboard."

I enjoy all the disciplines and being able to be succesful actually requires skill.  I can't claim to be very good at anything in this game, but it feels very similar to my real-life cricketing abilities, so there's that.I've spend the majority of my time playing the career mode in this game.  It feels pretty realistic, except that with some of my performances, i'm sure my county should have left me out of some games.Is the game perfect?  No.  The commentary is pretty inaccurate and repetitive.  There's a lot of missed catches for seemingly no reason.  And although I enjoy bowling, sometimes it's really hit-and-miss about how to dismiss a batsmen.  But as that's similar to the real thing, I guess that can't be a complaint.If you enjoy cricket games, buy it.  There's nothing I've played that's come close."

So, of course I bought it the day it came  out on PS3 then several months later on the PC. The mods are astounding for this game, the things some people can do, yes the gameplay can get a tad boring at times, but it's all the variety that makes it so great, so many modes to choose from. the graphics are quite fancy aswell, and quite realistic.Overall, my favourite game in my steam library (maybe 2nd to bad rats) I would reccomend DBC 14 to anyone who is a fan of cricket, and my crappy old computer can run it, so you can too!FINAL SCORE - 9.5 / 10 (only 9.5 because of all the times i have been bowled for a duck)"

The specialist batsman is great to play a few shots with, but I am struggling to keep my concentration, particularly if I've managed to get onto a couple of early boundaries (the same issue I had in real life)!My highlights after approx 15 hours?  Taking a 5 wicket haul for SA against Tassie and the 50 I scored for Derbyshire with my young opener off 13 balls!The only gripes I have with the game are the commentary being inserted at random as about 1/2 the time it doesnt make sense (so I've taken to playing music at the same time) and the grounds...I've had an English County game and SA v Tas at the MCG!  These are small issues though when compared to the important part of a cricket game...do the mechanics feel engaging, fluid and as though you are controlling your player...in short, yes!This game is fun to play and being a cricket game has enough stats to keep a cricket fan entertained.  Do I like my batting average being just under 30? No; will I keep playing to improve it? Yes!That is what this genre has been missing since Shane Warne/Brian Lara's cricket in the late 90s...a game worth playing!"

,Recommended,216260,10989103,"Posted: 30 June, 2014",all,Changed,"Simply put, the best cricket game of this generation (and the previous one combined).You need a gamepad (preferably an Xbox 360 controller) to play the game on your PC due to the nature of the controls. You need an analog stick to accuractely place your shots. A keyboard just will NOT work.Once you get hang of the controls, ball physics and other awesome mechanics of this game, you will truly fall in love with it.There are definitely issues with a few jerky animations here and there and a little boring and monotonous commentary, the great gameplay easily makes up for these issues.Pros:- Great gameplay for a Cricket game, easily the best of this and the last generation combined.- Detailed controls. Easy enough to start hitting boundaries and sixers but really hard to master.- Great replays, DRS (Decision Review System), ball mechanics and other fun stuff including lots and lots of statistics.- Online Multiplayer mode with the ability to save games to continue later (You can play full Test matches with your friends).- Lots and lots of very realistic looking players and and team uniforms.- Many game modes including a Career mode, tournaments, competitions and casual play.- Great comfortable camera angles to choose from.- Did I say you can field manually?- Full ability to make changes to teams and players through the Don Bradman Academy. Now play your favorite historical cricket players!- The most realistic and fun cricket game for many years now.Middleground:- Steep learning curve.- Could do with a field mini-map during balling and batting.- Decent graphics and audio (excluding commentary).- Requires an Xbox 360 controller for Windows.- Not a great teacher for those new to Cricketing rules etc. (Not an issue for cricket lovers)Cons:- Twitchy animations sometimes.- Due to the complex nature of the game, there are some bugs and issues which should hopefully be ironed out quickly. As of this review, such issues are few and dont really bother too much.- Commentary can get boring fast.- Lack of ""Voice Chat / Typing Chat"" during multiplayer matches. You have to use Steam, TeamSpeak, etc. for it.If you are a cricket lover and own a gamepad to play this with, get Don Bradman Cricket 14 now! And if you don't own a gamepad, still get this game and buy an Xbox 360 controller ASAP!Now I am done selling this, go and get it!Edit: Made a few changes to the Pros and Cons list."

You can play tournaments, create tourneys, play with your mates, play quick match with others... damn so good.Fake names? Kits? Faces? Well, say bye bye to that also. You can download teams, players, umpires, kits.. literally everything. And obviously you can create one yourself too.

,Recommended,216260,13360963,"Posted: 14 December, 2014",all,[wang] Explosive Kyushu,"THE PROS:There are a few problems I have with this game, but this is still the best Cricket game available on the market today. The controls are fluid and responsive for both batting and bowling, the graphics are very nice and getting a good score feels genuinely rewarding. The upper difficulty levels are brutal, but not impossible. With recent patches, nicks carrying behind have become far more common which makes fast bowling as a career player much more relevant and the ability to skip to your turn while batting means you are no longer forced to call for runs as the non-striker when you can't see where the ball went. These are all excellent changes.THE CONS:Anyone who's played a FIFA game before is familiar with the concept of rubber-banding and this game can really take it to the extreme. If the game decides you're out, you're out and if a fielder has to break the sound barrier running from square leg to take a catch on the boundary at deep long off to make that happen, then so be it. If your team is going to lose, it's going to lose and if the number 10 batsman on the team has to hit 300 off 90 balls to make that happen, then it's going to happen. It can be interesting, at least, to see all the ways the game can come up with to shaft you."

This is by miles the best cricket game ever.I also have Rugby league live 3 and have to say Big Ant are great at making sports sims. Both games are incredible.Takes some time to get good at, and you build up a range of skills as you go (some can be built up just playing in the nets). As skills get stronger (i.e Front foot strokes) your success rate with these moves will improve.Awesome cricket game, which you should get an XBox controller for, to fully experience it properly. Using the sticks to bat is the best ever, and most realistic batting contol i have experienced, once you get used to it. I recommend time in the nets, it builds skills and also helps you learn timing and how to use the controls. Make sure you change the bowling machine to throw you some spin bowling too. That is the hardest thing to deal with for new players.Highly recommended and i will probably buy DBC 17 too, after its had a major patch or 2. At this time DBC 14 is more polished."

I ignored trying it out on console as i prefer gaming on the pc (and their version of AFL Live was a far better experience on pc than on console so i figured i would not double dip in this instance).In a nutshell you have to forget about how you played cricket games in the past, now you really have to concentrate and work for your runs when batting. Bowling is a little more simple, but i assume on higher difficulty levels there will be a bigger challenge when bowling.The graphics are a bit hard to get used to at first, depending on the weather..... things REALLY stand out on a nice fine sunny day but on overcast days the graphics are not as nice. It's a cricket game after all and the only thing that really matters i the action on the pitch, and that is very detailed.I encourage anyone that is a cricket fan to buy this, you will enjoy it.

You WILL run out of time in some 4-day and test matches.-Bowling does seem a little too easy at the moment, however, I have only been playing on easier settings so far.-The orthodox cricket shots for a specific ball get you the best results over time.-Has some small things that need tweaking but....this is easily the Best Cricket game I have ever played!"

Despite its simplicity dbc14 makes me want to keep playing. It has a perfect balance of competition where anyone can succeed but it is still hard to master. This level of complexity is aided by the many levels of difficulty which allow the game to be played by all. The only problem I have with the game is the Ai such as your fielders missing catches or letting balls slide past through their feet for boundaries. Furthermore the umpire has left me screaming at my screen where I have hit someone for lbw plumb and the umpire still says not out even after review. Despite these minor flaws db provides hours of fun at the perfect level of competition. The perfect game for all armchair cricketers.

If BLIC 2005 was the hit and giggle, slap and tickle t20 of the cricket gaming arena, then this is test cricket. The bowling and batting controls are new and logical, whilst nice touches like the DRS system make it a well put together package. Scoring rates are realistic (don't expect to go pasting bowlers all over the place from the off) and sensible bowling is often rewarded.  The lack of players is made up for by a set up that allows for a mod community to make up for this, who have already made custom umpires (so far there are very good Steve Bucknors and Dickie Bird but no David Shepherd yet...).The terrible commentary (simple crowd noises would have suited me to be honest) and less good fielding are things you can live with.

A lot of them just looke like a re-hashing of a previous version...but finally we get something a little different.The controls are probably the biggest thing about this game. It gives a more natural feel to the game, almost like you are actually out there. But they aren't clumsy as they are in other games (FIFA for instance), and there's definitely room for error when using the tiny thumbsticks.The immersion of being in pro camera mode and batting in the middle is like nothing I've felt in any sports game. Taking penalties in FIFA is probably the closest I've gotten to the nervousness and sweaty palm-ness of facing a fast bowler late on day 5 trying to save a game in DBC14. It's like real life!The moddability of the game is a plus and the developers clearly haven't left PC gamers by the wayside like we've seen with so many other sports games.Having said all that, the game is not perfect. What sports game is? There are some weird animations and typical situations which are unrealistic. The game has some annoying bugs like playing all five tests in a series at one ground, or players not running after the ball when fielding, and the constant hitting of stumps when throwing the ball to the keeper or bowler, or the keeper getting stuck on the stumps...ugh. The selection of players in career mode is stuck on whatever the default line up was and never seems to change which can be frustrating, also you are stuck on your batting position for your whole career.I'm sure I could keep going on about what could be improved, but at the end of the day this is a solid game from a local Aussie company, and they've done an admirable job.

Sometimes the commentary says no rain, but it rains2) There should be a provison to alter and save the squad while playing in a tournament itself - like the lineup you changed in the previous match should get reflected for the next match by default. Every match, it is hard to change the lineups.3) Most of the teams dont have the latest T20 and ODI squad. Even reseting the academy didnt work4) Most of the times, the ball hits the stumps while the fielder throws, sometimes un-necessarily5) Replays are missing for key moments. Run-outs, great fieldings, good deliveries and wickets with DRS should be replayed automatically. It happens only for boundaries/sixers. Even for few boundaries which are tried hard to stop by fielders at the deep is not replayed. Unnecessary replays if the bowler just stops the ball should be avoided6) Field positions need to be standardised. They look sometimes awkward.7) Player of the series and a screen which displays the winner of the tournament with trophy image is not displayed.8) More grounds should be added.

If you have a gaming laptop, sometimes you find yourself in places without a connection. But more than that, the principle of ""checking in"" with the game's uptight DRM system to prove you have a verified copy, is a pathetic insult.Most games on Steam DO NOT do this.

That's pretty much all you need to know. Finally a developer has cracked the combination of making a game feel like a proper simulation of the sport. It oozes cricketness. Sure, you can play it like a hit and giggle arcade game if you want, but if you also want to make a ponderous innings in the vein of Chris Tavaré, the game is more than happy for you to go out and block every single ball back to the bowler.The graphics are very serviceable, animations are generally good although the bowling action isn't 100% smooth, with the ball popping out of the bowlers hand at slightly odd angles, I suppose rather a tricky thing to model though when you have to allow all the variations in bowling and outcomes that result. Batting is a real joy, I love spending a while at the crease fashioning a score. And then smashing a ball down a patrolling outfielders throat having forgotten he was out there. Foolish.Career mode is wonderful. You take control of one person. You perform their every cricketing move, if you fancy it. I generally only bother with batting myself as I am a glory hunter who prefers not to toil too hard. I've not progressed too far, but I am happy in my role as a county cricketer. One day I'll develop the patience and progress to international level. Maybe.There's still a couple of minor aesthetic issues with the game although the devs are actively patching it at the moment. Hopefully these will get resolved.Anyway, this review can all be boiled down to this: do you like playing cricket games on your computer? If so, buy this, you can't go wrong. Simple."

Although it is decent, I do have a few issues nothing major but issues nonetheless that I feel should Big Ant address them it make the new release a lot better.Lack of customization in career.For me any sports game that allows you to put yourself in the game has to really pull out the stops for it to feel like a representation of yourself and have it as you want it and while it's not bad, not having any options to change bowling actions or having a preferred style of batting whether you're more into wristy flicks and a batsman who is looking to time to ball instead of someone who is a brute and is looking to put a lot of power into the stroke.I think BAS missed a great opportunity to make the career mode one of the highlights but as it happens it's just lacking thus far.Batting.While for the most part, batting is generally okay I feel there is not a lot of variety in shot animations. Very seldom you will see a batsman go full blooded and extend the stroke for say a straight drive or a on drive as you see in game, for the most part they will generallly push the ball back down the ground and allow the timing to get the runs.Also why no normal advancing shots? Seems strange you can't use your feet to work a ball into the gap instead of trying to launch it out of the ground.Bowling.Much like batting, bowling is in general done very well, can't argue with the variation given, although it's a little irritating that left handed bowlers stats are coded incorrectly Eg: When making a left arm pacer, in order to have a good outswinger from the left hander you have to set the best delivery to ""In Swinger"" perhaps a little nit picky but still, it shouldn't happen.Fielding and AIProbably the weakest area for me. Well struck shots that are next to fielders just result in them standing still then diving too late to get the ball and that's rather frustrating to watch.Catching animations are also a little odd especially when the wicketkeeper is catching edges istead of just taking a regulation catch they will turn their back towards the ball and somehow just dive on it but catch it nonetheless although funny I don't think we would see MS Dhoni do that :PBowling against AI feels kind of frustrating at times, they seem to have a real tendency to sweep the spinners a lot even to balls pitched outside off stump and there isn't much penalty for it, not had them top edge or anything like that.Even against pace bowlers, bowling on a good length swinging away from off stump or even just bowling seam up outside the off stump they will just fly swat it away to the leg side without much thought yet when I try it, of course I conveniently edge it straight to the slips. A little frustrating in truth.Besides what I've said, It's honestly not a bad game if you're after a decent sim style Cricket game, It really has a lot of potential should BAS make further iterations and I certainly hope they do."

When I saw this game, while browsing through the game store, my interest was peaked. I had been looking for a worthy successor to 'Brian Lara Cricket' - a great game in it's own right - and this seemed to fit the bill. I was a little hesitant about the cost, but after reading the reviews I took the plunge.I have rarely enjoyed my first couple of hours playing a game as much as I did this one. Graphically - brilliant! Atmospherically - it's like being there. The controls are instinctive, and the ball moves dynamically depending on how the bat connects with it - as it should. I still haven't mastered the field settings but the day, as they say, is yet young. Another aspect that surprised me was the depth of history that the team choices can offer. We all have our sporting heroes and to be able to pick a team with them in it is great - even from some time ago.All-in-all, I would highly recommend this game to all cricket fans. It is so good you can almost smell the grass. Play!"

Otherwise this game is a bit of a drag.Whilst the gameplay mechanics are solid, with the notable exception of fielding being bloody awful, the game has some wierd design decisions.A lot of information is withheld from you without, who's batting? what bowler are you facing? are they left arm fast, medium, slow? What condition is the pitch in? What condition is the ball in? Where are the fielders? Has the career AI captain changed my fielding set up again? (yes, yes he has) Whats the weather for the second day look like? Did my bouncer into the ribs of the batsman do anyting to unnerve them? Is it worthwhile? Should I run after hitting the ball? I don't know because the camera isn't facing the ball yet.These are questions that you have answered in near any other cricket game. There's no point playing a career game as a bowler if you have no way of knowing what condition the pitch or ball is in, let alone that your fielding setups will occasionally change without your knowledge (minimaps guys comeon).Some of the above info is accessible, but through many different menus rather than whilst playing it which slows an already slow game down - Except ball and pitch condition, you just have to figure out if the ball will swing or not...Career mode is a great idea, so so much potential, but the constant loading screens and lack of information about what is happening - plus the fact that a 16 year old is just thrown into first team matches against much better players - make it so frustrating.Great potential to be an amazing representation of cricket..

76561198074833486,Recommended,216260,13568005,"Posted: 24 December, 2014",all,GJB78,"Firstly, kudos to Big Ant Studios for developing what is undoubtedly the finest cricket game to date.For those of you who love cricket and have an appreciation for the nuances of the game, then I would highly recommend this title.  Although there are a couple of issues which have made the game less enjoyable for me recently, on balance it is an excellent cricket simulator and Big Ant are a worthy studio who should be encouraged to continue their fine work - although this game is not perfect, my advice to the diehard cricket tragics is that Big Ant represents the best chance we will get to cricket perfection in the future.  I sincerely hope they continue developing cricket games in future years.Firstly, the positives.Cricket is a very difficult and complex game in real life, and Don Bradman 14 has replicated this complexity in both batting and bowling.  Especially on the higher difficulty levels, concentration and timing are critical.  In batting, there is an excellent risk vs reward mechanism - it is possible to adopt a ""death or glory"" approach in a T20 match when fast runs are required, just as it is possible to build an innings in a test match with a more sober and judicious mindset.  When bowling, you will find that batsmen place a much greater value on their wicket in test matches - it is common (for me at least) to go many overs without a wicket, but when that breakthrough comes, it is tremendously satisfying.  Given that test matches can go for five days in real life, I think that Big Ant has done a good job of replicating this experience within the game.  Umpire decisions are imperfect, and it's possible to challenge a decision using DRS.  The vast majority of times, the umpire gets it right - but I have managed to challenge successfully a couple of decisions, and this has been a great thrill.To sum up the positives - there is a real emphasis on gameplay, and this has been executed very well.  It's enough to justify the purchase of the game.  I may have experienced a few gripes along the way, but the core of the game is solid, and in my opinion, this is the most important thing.The areas to be improved?Well, the graphics are fine, but not outstanding.  Having said that, they don't detract from the experience.  In-game sounds are fine but the commentary is insipid - hardly a gamebreaker, but something to be improved on in the future.  (I'm also a basketball fan, and the NBA2K franchise sets the standard for commentary as far as I'm concerned).  The one area I'm struggling with at the moment is the AI - I have found myself becoming increasingly more frustrated with this, particularly in short matches (ie: T20s).  In my recent experience, if my T20 team bats first, they win.  If they bat second, they lose.  Match simulations work well for the first innings, but the AI for run chases is just appalling.  It's so frustrating and disheartening when you bowl your guts out to restrict the batting team to a score of 100 to 120, only to find that your team falls ten runs short with 9 wickets in hand.  Running the simulation will never get them over the line - watching the rest of the team bat is almost torture.  (I remember a recent game when the two best batsmen in my T20 team needed 6 runs in the last over... they left three balls and hit the other three back to the bowler).  The AI running between the wickets is incredibly risk-averse (the only run-out I've ever seen in the game has been from when I was batting myself).  I'm about four years into my player's career at the moment, and these kinds of things are starting to make a big difference to my enjoyment of the game.There is nothing I have said in the previous paragraph which has not been raised in the forums, and to give them credit, the Big Ant developers have been responsive to player concerns.  Although there hasn't been a patch for a few months now, I'm hoping that the devs take all of this feedback into account for their next patch / version.Cricket fans - there's nothing else out there which will give you the same experience as this game.  Just buy it and support a team that will hopefully produce bigger and better things in the future.  Well done, Big Ant - and I look forward to your future releases."

Don't let challenge mean there is no enjoyment though, in career mode I was celebrating 20 runs like I scored a century and nothing felt as good as the first 50 and then 100.There is an amazing modding community over at planet cricket and if you're a retro lover like I am or just want the latest kits and bat sponsorship go over there right now and spend a bit of time getting the mods in to your game because the immersion that the mods brings takes this already fantastic game to a whole new level. Sometimes I just scan around the ground in awe at how great it looks.My Career is a great addition but it is a little barebones. That's not to say it isn't fun but don't expect NBA 2K level of career either.9/10 simply because nothing is perfect but this comes close. A must have for any cricket lover."

,Recommended,216260,23444697,"Posted: 7 June, 2016",all,richard_n413,"This is the best cricket game I've ever played. The batting is balanced: the forward defensive stroke is very safe, while the aggressive shots are likely to end in you losing your wicket - you are rewarded for playing the right shot in the right situation (as opposed to blitzing every ball for six à la EA Sports Cricket). You have little time to react to a fast ball, and split-second decisions are required, just like in real life.The AI is reasonable - the fielding positioning is questionable, but the actual gameplay is very good. The amount of misfields and overthrows are about right compared to real life. The career mode is fantastic - you control only your player, so if you get out for barely any runs as a batsman, that's the end of your contribution for the innings: you can't then just control the next seven or eight batsman that bat after you. As a result, the games are quicker (you can simulate the bits you're not playing), and your performance is more in the spotlight.Of course there are a few problems: the commentary is about as wooden as the cricket bats, the animations are a little bit glitchy from time to time (certainly nowhere near EA Sports Cricket or Ashes 2013 levels), and there may be a slight mismatch in run rates between the simulated and live-mode game. But these are tiny issues against an overwhelming success of a game - especially considering this is Big Ant's first try at a cricket game.Rating: 8.5/10. Could be improved, but stands up well against any sports game ever made."

The twin stick shot making is way better than choose-a-shot method of EA games. Bowling is also more fun than press-a-button. Especially since Spin and fast bowling uses different controls. I do wish they had the option for field radar. It does get annoying to keep looking through first person before every delivery since there really isn't any indication if there was a change in field placement. Also I really wish they would come out with a newer version of this game since it is now over two years old.

Cricket is inherently not an easy sport to digitally recreate but this is one of the better efforts so far. I guess the logical next step would be to fine tune the game physics slightly and to include motion captured bowling actions and batting stances (for the international players initially)Pros:The sounds are on point and the graphics are very acceptable. It feels like playing Cricket which is not an easy task to accomplish.Cons:After almost 200 hours, it has started to get a bit predictable and boring against AI but i guess the easy solution would be playing multiplayer (something i haven't tried).The shot variety is decent however it could do with more variety in the execution animation i.e. way the batsman looks while playing the same shot should be different for batsmen."

There's literally hundreds of hours of play there if you decide to play all the way through to retirement.A Warning: Batting can be frustratingly difficult beyond the rookie/amateur level due to reaction times otherwise this game is beyond awesome.

76561198038985659,Recommended,216260,29076995,Posted: 6 January,all,Shehzadashiq,"Finally there is a game which anyone who loves Cricket can play and enjoy which actually represents the game. Brian Lara used to be the benchmark but this redefines it. With codemaster and EA no longer developing Cricket games it's great that Big Ant developed this.Initially I was suspicious of having to play with a controller, all other cricket games were quite happy to be played with a keyboard. However once I tried it with a controller I could definitely see why it requires one.With one stick being used for foot placement and the other stick for direction, combining these two inputs with the modifiers (power,defensive,fancy) and the need for having proper timing means the array of shots becomes diverse and unpredictable. Also unlike other cricket versions this does not just descend into a boring slog match with every shot going for a 4 or a six.I have been able to use this to explain the game of cricket better to my children which means they enjoy cricket even more now and just for that alone I would recommend this to everyone who loves cricket.Pros- Great controls allow for diverse batting- Bowling is actually fun- Career mode where you actually need to develop your player from a rookie to an expert- Community generated content- A great physics engineCons- You need to be online to play- Occassionally the AI can behave strangely when running between wickets- Superhuman fielders- The cricket grounds are not particulary diverse"

This is definitely a hard turn on for purists but for T20 fans this can be equally disheartening as they can struggle about fancying to bat like David Warner or Chris Gayle.While Batting is ridulously hard and somewhat yielding unpredictable results, Bowling is the area where game hits perfect line and length on every single delivery.  The fielding part is not over complicated which is also a plus.AI definetly need a lot of improvement as although there have been so many patches and update to make it more competitve and push it towards ""Do or Die Attitude"" they still tend to plaqy defensive with stonewalling approach while the required run rate races towards impossible numbers. They would rather eat all the deliveries and lose the match rather than getting out trying.All in all if you want to play cricket virtually, this is the only game you can put your hands on."

,Recommended,216260,19495747,"Posted: 5 December, 2015",all,cwp7,"While I do recommend Don Bradman Cricket 14, please keep in mind that this is a very tentative endorsement.Don Bradman Cricket 14 was praised amongst friends and by fans of cricket all over the internet, but be wary of this praise. It's likely that, due to the long wait for a cricket game to be financially successful, people were willing to bend over backwards in order to praise the title, in spite of all its flaws, and DBC14 has them aplenty. DBC14 was downright broken on release and had any other game released like it did, it's likely refunds would have been demanded all across the board. Thankfully patches have remedied most of the issues, but these fixes were long overdue and should have been in the base game.Before I get to gameplay, there are a few more things about DBC14 worth discussing. Upon launch, the game loads this sort of ""demo test match"" where you can watch Australia play against England. This is tedious. I understand they want to show off the game's aesthetic but even if you've upgraded the games roster to show real names, the players are still unlicensed in the demo match, the frame rate is woeful, and it's a chore to skip. I understand they were going for a Mario Kart-like title screen where it shows off the gameplay, but in Mario Kart you press a button, you're at the menu. This isn't replacing the loading screen, it's adding to the loading time, and it should be removed from the game.That said, the ability to share teams and players online is fantastic, and fosters a great community. Why this hasn't been introduced into other sports titles like FIFA I have no clue, but it's execution is great here, censorship aside (really Big Ant?) Being able to play a career mode is great, but the skill progression is terrible. You can only muster up about 800 RPM if you start a new career as a spinner, rather than the 2000 or so you should be able to get from a young first class player. I've heard this is also an issue with pace bowlers, where you can only bowl a bit over 100 ks an hour, but I've only played as a leg spinner/batsman all-rounder so I haven't verified this.There is one glaring issue with batting, that is that there's no incentive to play on the back foot, and that opposition fields are very exploitable. If you play on the front foot to a short ball, your player can always get bat to ball, in some cases you can still hit a boundary, but if you play back foot to a full ball you will almost always be bowled if the ball's line is near/on your stumps. You stand to gain very little at the risk of your wicket playing on the back foot, as it's very easy to accidentally miscalculate the ball's length (even with the red/yellow/green circles), whereas playing front foot almost ensures you will never get bowled. Either there should be an option to make the length-telegraphing more easy (for example an optional difficully check that makes the game enter bullet time after the ball is released from the bowler's hand, showing the red/yellow/green length circle to allow for a less sudden reaction time) or there should not be an option for playing on the back/front foot, and instead the game should take the Brian Lara International Cricket 2005 (a great cricket game that's unfortunately seldom mentioned) approach, where you just choose the direction you're going to hit the ball, and your player automatically goes on the front/back foot dependent on the length of the ball.Quickly elaborating on the exploitable fielding, it's always easier to go on the front foot, and always premeditate your shots to where there is a gap in the field. Playing on the front foot, the worst that happens is that you miss the ball anyway, and the fields are very rarely changed during an over by the opponent AI, so if there's no cover, just keep going for drives and you can easily get 24-36 runs in an over by pure premeditation.Despite these flaws, being able to play online against or with a friend is great, though I was left wishing you could 2v2 online with 3 friends, I believe this was possibe offline. Being able to view the ground first person before the ball was bowled and use the games replay mode were cool and the DRS is actually really impressive, even though it's kinda obvious that the umpires will defer to the 3rd Umpire so often just to show off the attention to detail in the DRS. If you are a cricket tragic and you want to play through a virtual career, then go for it (just don't play a spinner like I did, it's kinda insulting how little RPM your player can muster up), or if you want to play against your friends often then you're the type of person who should be buying DBC14, but I can't recommend the game to people beyond that demographic. I found the career mode and online multiplayer to be worth the asking price, even if if wasn't all I had hoped for.Edit: I usually play this game on my 360, so the hours played isn't very accurate. On the 360 I would have 30 hours+, I mainly use Steam for online multiplayer."
