And well, it kind of is, but it does so much more. The puzzles get progressively harder and more complex as you get different guns, and the last sequence of puzzles before the end is kind of just completely brain-melting. There's a surprisingly high execution factor in some cases, as well. And this is only the normal difficulty. I've not played the game's ""hard"" mode but I doubt I'd be able to complete it if I did. The graphics are kind of ugly though, all things considered,  but that's a minor knock against it."

,Recommended,216290,21345684,"Posted: 20 February, 2016",all,Audish,"There have been a lot of clever puzzle gimmicks over the years. There were time clones in Braid and P.B. Winterbottom, rotating the world in And Yet It Moves (shame about the game), and portals in... well, Portal. There have been riffs and imitators on each as well, but did you ever think about combining them? Because that's just what Gateways does, and it's even more mind-bending that what you're imagining.You play Ed, a brilliant, balding scientist whose sprawling lab has just been ransacked. To get to the bottom of whatever it is, you're going to need to retrieve his gateway guns. There are four in total, each granting you a remarkable power over space and time. You have your basic portal gun that lets you go in one end and pop out the other. Then there's a resizing gun that lays down a big portal and a little portal, making you bigger or smaller depending on which one you enter. There's a rotation gun that works like the portal gun except it maintains your orientation, essentially rotating the world around you. And there's a time gun that lets you loop over the same span of time over and over, creating clones of yourself. You'll also find a few additional tools, as well as bonus upgrades like higher jumps and more time loops.As you locate the portal guns, you'll encounter all sorts of puzzles throughout Ed's rather open-form laboratory. Your map will helpfully point out the next key puzzle to tackle, but you can always go searching for side paths and bonus puzzles that you might be able to solve with your current abilities. Each puzzle is helpfully marked with a Help Point, where you can spend a few orbs (found in tricky spots all over the lab) to confirm whether or not you have the right tools to solve the puzzle, or a lot of orbs to view the solution and skip the puzzle. It's a clever system for avoiding frustration, especially if there are gateway guns you're having trouble coming to grips with.The puzzles start out as good introductions to your fantastic powers, and grow steadily into reasonable challenges. After a few hours, you'll probably have a solid command of each gateway gun, and be wondering why there are still puzzles you can't quite work out. And then you find the power that lets you use all the guns simultaneously, which launches the difficulty curve into space. Honestly, just dealing with a handful of time loops or working out a rotation maze taxed my brain to the limit. Combining them overwhelmed me to a degree I didn't think was possible anymore. You'll be using time portals to send your tiny past self to hold a switch while your giant future self reflects a laser through a right-angled portal into another switch so your present self has a few seconds to slip through a gate... or at least that's what's expected of you.Gateways is pretty much everything you could ask for in a puzzle platformer, taken to almost comical extremes. It looks good, sounds good, has plenty of puzzle gimmicks, items to collect, secrets to find, and enemies to squash (in strangely bloody fashion, too). But it's going to challenge you in ways other games don't, and it will keep pushing until you've fully mastered every aspect of your powers. I reached a point where it got to be too much for me, a level of complexity far beyond Braid or Portal or anything that inspired it. If you're seeking that challenge, don't pass this one up, and even if you aren't it might be worth a try.Did you enjoy this review? I certainly hope so, and I certainly hope you'll check out more of them athttps://goldplatedgames.com/or on mycuration page!"

I wish Valve's playtesters hadn't weeded out the 5 emancipation grid room, or thrown up when walking on the ceiling""? Well, you're in luck.This game is, from my vague knowledge of Metroid, a hybrid of Portal and Metroid. You are a scientist, stuck in his lab, with all the areas therin sealed off by devious puzzles only solvable by your gateway (Portal) devices. Yes, devices. You get the basic one early on, but then you find yourself needing to rotate gravity, and link time AND space, and make yourself small (or large, but I managed to Portal all the large situations) through the same device. As you get more unlocks, you can explore more of the map, and open up harder puzzles.This doesn't have GLaDOS, but the cruel puzzles make up for it (you can buy automated solutions for just 25 hint orbs, but generally the 5 orb ""Is this possible yet?"" question is more entertaining).If you want a very much easier platformer with the same time mechanics as here you can check out Shuggy by the same dev. But it is very very easy, and I'd only recommend it to kids. Seasoned platformers are going to find that the only challenge here is trying to complete two player co-op with one character on each hand."

More like Portal on steroids!The fact that this kind of games are constantly compared to Portal may be unfair, but it's rather unavoidable, given the presence of a precese of what's basicly 2D version of the portal gun.As one of four different kinds of portal guns. The most mind bending of these has to be the one that created portals in time, altough the gravity changing one comes as a close second.All in all, the game is a solid puzzle platformer with a heavy emphasis on puzzles, later of which could take me up to an hour just to solve one. The pixel graphics may be a bit too pixely for some, but overall the presentation holds up, as does the user interface. Mostly. Juggling the extra tools can be a bit of an hassle sometimes and you'll hope there would be an easier way to set the portals up as you reach the point were you're just tweaking your solutions."

There are many more mechanics than the other games of this type, with size-changing portals, time-travel portals, rotation portals, and, best of all, regular portals through an area. You place them down to solve puzzles, which were always challenging but never seemed impossible. The art direction was great, the music, not so much, but overall this was a good purchase.

The puzzle design has some of the most difficult puzzles in the game being mandatory to complete, which wouldn't be a problem normally. But, the mechanic you unlock near the end of the game that enables these puzzles involves a lot of key timing and platforming that ended up being far too twitchy for me to finish.Ultimately, because I have no 'maybe' option, I have to vote No on Gateways because of this. Perhaps if they had structured the game a little differently I could recommend it. But sadly, if any of what I mentioned seems like a red flag for you, I'd look elsewhere."

This 2D puzzle platformer's source material is undeniable, particularly when you've explored enough of the laboratory to find your first portal gun.

The later puzzles are mind-warpingly complex in a good way, particularly once you've got free access to time travel (which is beautifully intuitive, necessary for some puzzles, and neither limited nor unbalancing).

The later puzzles can be absolutely maddening, often requiring the use of all four gateway guns to solve. Luckily, the blue collectibles you find throughout the lab can be used to buy 'hints' as well as show the solution for any puzzle you get stuck on.This is an excellent game, but if you're easily frustrated by puzzle games, you should probably consider skipping this one."

The real puzzles happen once you get the Multi-Gun which allows you to use all gateways at once. However,  the amount of brain bending in this game is a little too much for me. You do not get too much practice with each gateway to learn how to effectively use each type.Maybe this is all a good thing because there are not too many puzzle-platforms out there that truly push the puzzle element.It's a great game if you are willing to stop and think hard about how to solve each puzzle."

Thankfully, you can find out if you are able to solve any given puzzle fairly easily so you know whether to go for it or give it up for the time being. With power ups such as those that allow you to jump higher, make yourself larger or smaller, and use copies of yourself to solve puzzles this game is jam packed with cool ideas. The game is challenging at times but brings a lot of satisfaction and is all around a lot of fun.The one negative thing for me is that figuring out how to use the time power is hard to do, especially iinitially with little explanation of it.

You have the space-wraping portal, but also the- rotation portal which changes the direction of the gravity- shrinking/growing portal- time-wrapping portalThe combination these different portals give raise to a myriad of possibilities for endless headache. Whenever you face a new puzzle, however, you might still be unable to solve it: you might need to revisit that puzzle in the future. For this reason, the game gives you the choice of spending some ""power orbs"" in order to reveal if you can solve a specific puzzle or not.Which then brings the cons of the game. The map is huge and let me tell you, not fun to navigate at all. Curisouly enough, the game is rather short: I have the feeling that if the puzzles would be presented linearly in their solveable sequence, this game would have beeneven shorter.Also I felt like there could be more puzzles combining the portals, and the ending felt ""lazy"". Also, this gamescreamsfor a little bit of a story in a comic/sarcastic tone, but there is *nothing*, be warned.The puzzles are solid, enjoyable and not overly frustrating but also nothing ingenious. Achievements are fine, except for ""That's the way to do it"" which cannot be obtained in Linux. If you don't support the achievement in asupported platform, please, remove the achievement, that didn't even need to be said. Otherwise the game gave me no headache in Linux.So as a puzzle game, this is a good (short) game. It could have been more, but that's all that it is. It might be enough."

And for the first twenty or so minutes, that's basically what it turns out to be.However, it isn't long until the game's true nature reveals itself. It's a cross between a metroidvania and a puzzler. The game takes place in a single massive level, and you're supposed to go from place to place gathering powerups that let you go to the next place. Those powerups are new puzzle tools you use to solve the puzzles blocking the way to the next powerup. It even has optional powerups, just like any good metroidvania.It's put together quite well. There are help points for each puzzle that can first tell you (for a small cost*) if your current powerups are enough to solve the puzzle and, if so, can then show you (for a large cost*) how they are solved. That being said, the puzzles (at least thus far) have been trivially easy to solve. Maybe the tough ones are reserved for the end of the game. We'll see. At least it has a level editor and workshop support.*These costs are paid with in-game pickups. I figure this is worth clarifying in this day and age of in-app purchases."

,Recommended,216290,2274102,"Posted: 11 July, 2013",all,MrHackman,"While it does suffer from many of the standard sidescroller problems (enemies for the sake of enemies, pointless wall/floor spikes you can't see because of the game's finite view so you fall right into them), it's clever mechanics more than make up for it. Gateways took the idea of portals and rather than asking what can we have players throw through them (cubes, goo, hard light bridges), Gateways asks how can we make the portals themselves different (time portals, gravity shifting, size changing), which in honesty is a more interesting idea than what Portal 2 did. It's downfall lies in the sidescrolling nature which kept you from seeing all of a puzzle at once, it's excuse plot and dialog (who locked me in here? spoiler warning, it was you all along), and the fact that it is in 2d (not a flaw per se, but the possibilities for puzzles are much more varied in 3d). A net positive however, and worth picking up whenever it goes on sale. Here is hoping for a sequal that will really have us thinking with Gateways!"

It know I will relaunch it from time to time."
