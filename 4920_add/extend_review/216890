,Recommended,216890,11747352,"Posted: 16 August, 2014",all,Bogor Represent!,"Blood Bowl: Chaos EditionMany people will tell you that Blood Bowl is unfair. Other people will tell you the RNG is rigged. Yet other people will defend it with their lives. Blood Bowl is just not a game that respects you, especially if you go out there and try to win by murder. It will spank you, waterboard you and then anally invade you with spiked baseballbat that has glasshards glued on for good measure.I have had my trial by fire on the boardgame and got butchered by experienced players. It was enough to not want to play anymore, mostly because of the discussions with the rulebook in hand. Yet, I was also constantly drawn back to it until I got absorbed by Epic and built myself a nice Eldar army.But then I got the 360 version and was hit over the head with a game that applies the rulebook to a fault. No more sneaking stuff past my opponent, no more obfuscating the rules with 'you're interpreting the rules wrong, muppet!'. Instead, I got steamrolled over and over again, until I wised up and started to take the full time allowance on a turn, always trying to get at double dice on every action that needs them. I begun to make progress, but the on-line was so horrid I turned away from the game.Today, I decided to buy the Chaos Edition for PC on a whim. Fact is that I'm not that into GW-games anymore. I sold off my hobby some time ago, mostly because I outgrew the demographic. Whenever I walk into the GW-store, I feel like a child-molester for one and inviting a kid over to play a game of Epic just has too many negative connotations to it.Getting back in the saddle was easier than I thought, but much of that is in selecting the team that supports my play-style instead of a team that looks bad♥♥♥♥♥but is a dog to manage.Blood Bowl looks very pretty to my eyes. Cyanide did not go for flashy imagery but instead kept it simple and to the point. Game music is likewise utilized and during the matches there is a duo-presentation by two dudes who sadly will have run out of new things to say after you've played a few matches.I have not yet played with the Blitz rules, opting to play Classic-rules (Read GW-authentic) instead. The Classic-rules play by the boardgame rules and follows that ruleset to the letter, which results in nailbiting matches, as long as you play on Hard. I don't say this to be leet. On Easy, you'll win. On Medium, the AI will anally probe you. On hard, the AI gets slammed by the rules as hard as you are. How that can be, I don't know. The game was like this on the 360 too.Winning thus depends on team-choice and choosing a team should be a factor of your playstyle. For me personally that meant a choice between the Dark Elves or the Amazons. After having tried a few games with the Dark Elves I noticed that I couldn't pull off miracle plays with them. I like to dodge and play a passing game and the Dark Elves are the proverbial team for that. (Still the best DLC I bought on the 360.)I started over, going for the Amazons this time, who all have Dodge as a natural skill. At first I felt it was hopeless, but slowly I was getting the results. After being butchered a few times, I got a handle on the Amazons and started to fight the AI to a stand-still. Some time later I managed to win a match with a miracle play, passing the ball from the midfield-line to a Catcher in the end-zone.Blood Bowl is not an easy game. One of the first things a new player should learn is that tackle-zones are the backbone of Blood Bowl. Each pawn on the field has a tackle-zone, consisting of 8 squares around that pawn. Pawns that have overlapping tackle-zone empower eachother, making offence and defence easier. For offence, blocking an enemy pawn is a snap if it has base to base contact with other pawns that are friendly to you. For defence, understanding that tackle-zones are only good for enemy pawns entering it is key.As you play matches, your players will level up, provided they did something that gives them points. There are many ways a player can get EXP and not all of them are obvious. Blood Bowl does however apply them according to the official boardgame rules (if you play Classic, which I recommend.) and does so rigidly. Should you ever question the game's judgement, crosscheck the decision with the ruleset, which is included in the game. I have not been able to fault it sofar.Leveling your players up will allow you to give your players extra skills. There are loads of skills, but not all of them will suit your players or your style. Take the time to read the description of skills. But most of them are obvious. The first extra skill a Catcher should get is Sure Hands. A Runner should get Sure Feet quickly. A Blitzer should keep an eye out for Break-Tackle.Blood Bowl comes with a hefty Single Player experience. First there is the tutorial. This is scripted as heck and it won't allow you to experiment. But for new players it does open the game a little, though it won't go into specifics. Therefore it's better to play a few exhibition matches after you've done the tutorial.The Exhibition matches are perfect for experimenting, because they don't have a persistent effect on your team. Work on your starting set-up and watch the AI closely. Here you get the goods on how teams are played, which is unvaluable information for the other game-modes. Many tactics the AI employs are also good to use by you.Begin a Campaign is a set mode where you buy the team of your choice (or field one of your existing teams) and try to reach the top of the different leagues and tournies.Begin a Competion is like the Campaign, but now you set it up to your specifications before you start play.Story Mode is very different as you're free-agent coach who coaches teams that need your expertise. This time, the focus is on you and your managerial skills. And you'll be tested. Hard.World Cup is like the wolfmother of Blood Bowl. Hear you must lead your team to greatness entering nothing but tournaments and your goal is to eventually qualify for the ultimate event.All these modes can't be completed in a single evening. These modes are all in depth and content rich and successfully completing them will take your dedication and test your motivation.Don't go into this game believing that you'll trash it on your first match. Learn from the AI, see how it handles ball-possession and see how it defends. A wise man once said that no one ever learned something from winning and nowhere is this more true than in Blood Bowl.-Do safest actions first.-Do less safe actions second.-Do dangerous actions last.-Always guard your ballcarrier.-Buy re-rolls pre-game over stuff like Bribes and Bloodweiser Babes.-Cheerleaders and Coaches are the most helpful during kick-offs. Look for other things to buy first.-Use fouls and bribes to disable enemy keyplayers, like Catchers, Throwers and Runners. Don't waste them on rank and file.-Try to use all your re-rolls in a half, they get replenished at half-time. Re-rolls are instrumental to your play, so don't let them go to waste, use them as needed and don't be frugal with them thinking that you'll get a better chance to use them later.I love digital Blood Bowl, but the love took a wile to take hold. Blood Bowl rewards the patient, thinking player and it really opens up to those that stick with it and gain skill. Once you get past the disappointment of playing a game that won't let you win and start to recognize what works and what doesn't, Blood Bowl is one of the more rewarding games to play.For those that want to always win and who want to be leet 24/7, Blood Bowl has little to offer."

Turn based fantasy sport satire boardgame?It's quite unique, and I have difficulty describing it in a simple way so I will explain the gameplayYou have a team of 11-16 pieces(Your players), and you face off against a team of similar size. Only up to 11 per team can be on the field at once. It is vaguely remniscent of American Football(Handegg for you Europeans out there), where you have a ball and you need to run it into your opposition's endzone to score. Different from the sport however is that you take turns moving your pieces.This leads to a more strategic and tactical game, with the dice-based mechanics making it mainly a challenge of risk avoidance, while maximising the risk for your opponent.Of course, being a Warhammer universe, there are races other than humans. And everything is much more violent. It is not unusual for a team to have players die on the field, or to have them permanently injured. And tactics are much less throwing balls and passing for the less dextrous races(Orks tend to not have a great catcher for one, and the passing game of a dwarf team is notorious for being poor), and more other things. Stalling, outmanouvering your opponent, or just plainly trying to beat them all to a pulp and walk right through them are options. There are plenty of tactical choices to be made, and several strategic ones as well - A team can last you a very long time, and knowing how to build the skills on your team is crucial to your success in the later matches.In the end, it is a very interesting game. It has a little something for everyone, from amazing comebacks out of a long pass by an elf team to the pure carnage of a band of orks having themselves a good old brawl while there just happens to be a ball in the mix somewhere, to entirely other playstyles entirely.While often I think of something to say that would let you know whether or not you'll like it, the only way to know for sure with Bloodbowl is to try.It's very hit and miss.  If you end up enjoying it, you can get a long, long time out of your money. And if not, well. It was cheap(If you got it on sale), and you tried.And even then, it's a great game to play with a friend while just talking or doing something else on the side.Blood Bowl Chaos edition includes all content of Legendary edition.New in Chaos edition are three new teams/races you can pick, none of them overpowered so you are not buying power here, while at the same time being 100% compatible with Legendary edition.There are extra voice lines, a new stadium, and a new price tag!Buying Chaos edition gets you all the content in Legendary as well, so you can consider it the 'full edition' at this point. (Before Bloodbowl 2 anyway)Is it worth a whole 10 bucks more? Up to you. But do know that during sales it is often available for a much cheaper price, a total of 7,50 seems to be customary.Worth it on sale? You bet it is. Worth it for everyone? As before, maybe. But I do recommend giving it a try just in case you like it. Because if you do, you'll wonder where the hours went, and why the sun is coming up already.I highly recommend Cknoor and his group for both learning to play, finding the fun in the game if you're not sure on what to amuse yourself with, and finding people to play withhttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/cknoorbowl"

But be warned:  it's hard, unforgiving, and frustrating as hell.A lot of people buy this game without having a background in wargaming type games, and they start thinking the RNG is broken.  I can understand that, because it can be frustrating to play well then get your♥♥♥♥♥kicked down the field because of bad dice rolls.  But that's how wargames are - you're making strategy based on the odds of the rolls.If you can get that in your head, then you can start to learn the strategies - like doubling up on blocks to improve your odds.  Making use of the special skills of the various players.  Changing tactics against teams based on if they pass, brawl, etc.It took me a good 12 hours to get the hang of it, and I've been playing wargames a long time.  I'm finally starting to win against the AI.  I played one online game, and they other player mopped the pitch with me, so I need a lot more practice.But if you have the patience to develop the skills, you'll find this a lot of fun (even though it's very frustrating).  I also recommend looking for various online strategy guides that will help you with concepts / tactics like ""The Cage"", etc.  It reduces the learning curve and makes the game enjoyable sooner."

There are a number of leagues available from the beginners league to the specialities like ""no bash"" (where ""bashy"" races such as Orc and Dwarf are not allowed entry). Which means that you will be sure to find a match to suit you for style and player experience.On top of that of course there are Private Leagues.If you have a group of friends looking to find a good fun 2-player game which runs 1-2 hours then look no further.One last thing: In some sale conditions it can work out cheaper to buy Legendary edition AND Chaos edition than it is to buy Chaos Edition by itself."
,Recommended,216890,7980202,"Posted: 9 December, 2013",all,Digital Hero,"This game falls in one of two categories: You will love it immensely, or you will hate it and wish you never played it.For starters, it has a tremendously high learning curve. I've put my share of time in with both this and the legendary edition and I'm still learning new tactics. Couple that with every single team having their own specific playing style that you need to learn to a certain degree, and you have a death sentence for a new player that isn't patient enough to actually learn the ins and outs of the game.If you can get passed that, it CAN be a tremendously fun game. There are few things more satisfying then a miracle touchdown play on the last turn of a game. It can also be so incredibly disheartening that you'll rage quit instantly. That is the nature of a game built around rolling dice though. Tragedy is around every corner.So what is it? A sports game? Sort of. It's most accurately a competitive turn-based strategy game that isn't balanced. Some teams are specifically there for scoring and making exciting plays. Others are there to break those teams and kill as many players as possible. A third type is a gimmick sort of styled team that can be fun if you can work your way around their (potentially broken) achilles' heel.There are 23 teams in total in this game, providing enough variety that if you feel like you're not enjoying the game, it could just be you're not playing the right team. For example, my favorite team to play is Lizards. They can bash with the best of them, but the skink ball carriers are more than capable of doing some miracle-esque types of plays that make things exciting. However, I can't stand playing with (or against for that matter) slower, more hit-aggressive teams like Orcs or Dwarves, as they don't bring as much of a high octane energy that I enjoy. The enjoyment this game brings you starts and ends with the teams you pick.I also recommend having a friend play this with you and not just jump into a league (public or private), as that will be good practice. It will also bring less of a feeling of angst when you start, as (hopefully) either they can help you learn OR you'll learn together.So, all in all, it can be quite fun. I recommend it, but be warned this game is not easy to play, and can be emotionally crushing if you get invested in a team only to have your star players get killed by a blown dice roll."

It takes the rules that required hours upon hours of bickering in real life to being automatically resolved. This saves you quite a bit of frustration, even if the dice rolls will still make your perfect team die horribly at the game's whim. If you liked the board game, you will like this game.However, if you haven't played the board game, it's an acquired taste. You'll need to be able to accept that your rolls will dictate your fate, that your best player, that you've built up with the best possible upgrades, can die at any time, and that even if you play with perfect strategy, some times you will fail anyway. It's a brutal system, but it can provide a lot of long-term satisfaction if you have the patience for it.Note: (The game is way more fun to play with a group of friends in tournament mode)"

This game is an expansion to Blood Bowl that was developed in 2009 by Cyanide and published Focus Home Interactive and is based on the board game ""Blood Bowl"" that is produced by Games Workshop.Blood Bowl: Chaos Edition has a great variety of game modes available for both single player and multiplayer that will keep you entertained for days providing the dice gods don't come down on you too harshly.It is however recommended that you play using Classic mode and playing using turn based due to the fact that blitz mode is an awful edition to the game since it does not fit in well and functions clumsily.There are a 23 races to choose from in Blood Bowl chaos edition and helps to add a nice variety to the teams you come up against, some races share similar players but overall there is a lot to choose from and picking what team you want to play as can take quite some time.Blood Bowl: Chaos Editions graphics are perfectly suitable for what it is trying to achieve and generally looks visually pleasing and adds a fair amount of detail into the surroundings and units, for a game made in 2009 you defiantly can't complain.On lower difficulty settings the AI make irrational moves that tend to lead to costly mistakes, while the higher levels of AI provide some challenge but you most likely will want to look for opposition using multiplayer.If you want a faithful recreation of the board game Blood Bowl this is the only video game you should currently choose to try out due to the fact that it is quite high quality and is a quite compelling experience overall.I highly recommend that you give this game a try if you like a challenging board game-esque strategy game.Rating - 8 - A must buy!Advantages- Compelling Game play- Lots of variety- The best of its kind on the marketDisadvantages- Irrational AI at lower difficulties"

The game itself plays a lot like chess, with a turn based system in which one team attempts to score as many goals as possible (as you'd expect). The difference between Blood Bowl and an ordinary game of football, however, lies in the fact you can maim, bribe and murder the other team if you so desire, making for some intersting matches to say the least. The selection of teams is diverse, with each having their unique feel and playstyle instead of just being re-skins of the same team. If you're considering getting into the tabletop version, I most certainly recommend playing this first as it can teach you the basics of the game and is incredibly fun to play with friends.Don't enable the real-time option if you value your sanity."

,Recommended,216890,18886951,"Posted: 4 November, 2015",all,ThatDarnOwl,"Blood Bowl is an adaptation of a tabletop game by the same name that was created by Games Workshop. It takes place in an alternate version of the Warhammer Fantasy universe where all of the races decide to settle their differences playing games of American Gridiron Football.Much of the aesthetic of Blood Bowl was nailed perfectly. The look of the more general races like the Humans resemble 1950's caricatures of Football players. While the more fantastical races like the Undead look like mummified quarterbacks. There's a significant amount of content in this release, with a total of 23 races. Each with their own unique roster of players and distinctive gameplay balance.My favorite aspect of Blood Bowl is it's extensive singleplayer experience that also appears in the multiplayer. If your players get injured this carries over into subsequent matches, and if they die you lose them forever. Your players also level up and gain Fallout style perks. It reminds me a great deal of strategy games like X-Com. The entire game is turn based and every action in the game is determined through rolling a 6 sided die. It is a surprisingly faithful recreation of the original tabletop game, which puts off a lot of players as a result.Blood Bowl gets frequently referred to as an ""RNG game with a mix of strategic elements"". Which I personally disagree with. The random elements to the game make the game stand out to me compared to a lot of other strategy games. Where you can have a player void his entire turn because of a botched pass, forcing you to adapt. The meta of the game as a result revolves around minimizing the amount of rolls you might have to make, taking full advantage of your teams strengths. Because of these random elements, succeeding with a plan feels much more earned than it normally would be in any other strategy game. You feel that Ork score a touchdown, you feel your team win a tournament. It all feels really good when you win.Which brings me to my criticisms of the game. While Cyanide did a hell of a job adapting the rules, the game doesn't really explain very core fundamentals. Things like the balance between the races, roster selection, and even what particular plays are more effective over others. Blood Bowl is a game that requires practice and most importantly patience. You won't fully learn the game without losing several matches and clocking in upwards of 10 hours into it even. It takes a lot of reading guides and practice to really understand how to play it.But that's one of the most satisfying aspects of Blood Bowl. To me it's a turn based strategy game that's willing to anger you, that's willing to grind your teeth, that's willing to paint facepaint on your cheeks and dump Gatorade down your throat. This game is one of the finer examples of injecting variety into an otherwise bland sports game, and it really makes you feel like you're playing it in both body and mind.One last thing to note is the ""Chaos"" edition to the game is the complete version, with more content than the Legendary edition. While you can play online with players from the Legendary edition, it comes highly recommended to get this version to recieve the full experience."

The underlying mechanics are great, and Chaos Edition was, even with the release of BB2, the definitive edition of the game.Keyword was. With the release of BB2 we saw a slow downward spiral of the MP community, to the point where today, the only action going on in BB1, either CE or Legendary, is in scheduled organized leagues. As such I cannot reccomend BB1 to a new player. BB2 may be a steep ask what with the lesser amount of teams, but it's where most of the pickup MP community has gone. There also is the freeware alternative called FUMBBL, that's 2d and java based. Both are a far better option than BB1 now for actual MP.Ordinarily I would not go an remove and change the thumb to a down for a game simply because of the MP community drying up, but for Blood Bowl the entirety of the game is both MP, and has moved on to a nearly identical platform as well at that, and thus I feel obliged to steer people to those two alternatives, either the updated retail version, or the smaller, more hardcore community of the freeware game."

Although the game generally works very well, it's much more enjoyable when you sit yourself down to the actual rules. It's a little bit of work, but these rules were honed through years of playtesting and active experience and what has come out makes sure that every game is exciting, unpredictable and challenging. Above all it's a game that teaches one to learn to deal with the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ situations you can be put in or marvel at the gutsy gambles that have paid off.Not recommended for people that dislike chance as a whole; you can minimize the risk to a great amount and the winner of league is generally the better player, but the winner of a match is sometimes decided by the dice gods.My very first game my most expensive player was hit and killed by a rock thrown by the audience; before I had even made a single decision.

It's based on a somewhat high level table top board game and plays out like one in video game form.  Blood Bowl is a game of incredible depth and takes a serious amount of time to learn to do it well.  But if you do take that time and understand that this game is all about managing risk, you'll find it very rewarding in a reasonable amount of time.While it might seem like a relaxing sit-back-and-click type take on the sports genre, it's rather tense.  Building your own teams, naming the players, and leveling them up has you second and third guessing each decision.  These players become extensions of you to a point, and risking them can be difficult!  The emotional and strategic depth in this game is unlike anything I've experienced.  I can't reccomend it enough for fans of table top board games or fans who might be into a sports/rpg hybrid.I had played Blood Bowl 2 on the consoles first, which gives you a pretty good understanding of the rules and the risks involved.  This version is much more complete, with many more races to choose from than BB2. Like more than twice more.  The graphics aren't as good but this game runs well even on my old beatup laptop.  And it doesn't look bad.  The controls and interface is fantastic as I always feel like I'm making the move I want to make.I know some of the negative reviews seem to be people who had frustrating dice rolls.  I promise that this game was never meant to be that hard.  It's supposed to be a deep table top board game at it's core, but it's not supposed require hours and hours of research before playing.  You will fail, but as long as you can understand why you fail in a rather short time you'll learn the rules pretty quickly.  I'm not the biggest fan of table top games in the world and I managed to learn the rules.Pro tip: If you want additional resources theres a YouTuber named cKnoor who has excellent beginner and intermediate level strategy videos.  They helped my game immensely."

All of their units were decked out with good added skills like  block/dodge except the large zombie frontline.I managed to push through on the right side of the field before being swarmed, beinng forced to hand off the ball to the lineman at the top of  my cage.I beat down the ghouls just barely and had my new character leg it up the field, standing ip my downed guys on that side in a vain hope to hold them off before scraping into the endzone.Then came the second half. If the AI gets preferential treatment, this was proof of it to me.. .Ghouls were slipping and sliding through multiple tacklezones with no rerolls every time. taking the ball near the endzone.I managed to contain the ball and push the carrier off. The ball came back and landed  a square away from the nearest ghoul. My lineman safety I'd kept for insurance failed the blitz roll with a skull.Then it was 1-1, two turns left in the half. My norse team had been beaten  senseless by this bashy team all game and I managed another breakout into their half, fouling and containing the ghouls on my side.I'm so close. I'd never gone to overtime in any game I've played before, so I was dreading having to set up again, but luckily, I pulled off the same epic hand-off pass and got my runner just out of range of their team, who was busy beating my team to a pulp. Although, two of the smaller zombies managed to reach me. One of the zombies was too far away, but the other was right on my runner.In the last turn of overtime I blitzed, breaking one tackle roll and pushing the zombie out of the way for the sweet, sweet, game winning touchdown.I was so salty in the second half at the ""f****** b*******"" rolls  the AI got, but the end  result was that much sweeter.Do you want epic moments with a mountain of salt on the side?

,Recommended,216890,8295389,"Posted: 26 December, 2013",all,Emerald Witch,"These devs have released a lot of new editions with very minor differences in the 4-5 years leading up to Chaos Edition and got on my nerves, but I'm willing to forgive them for it because Blood Bowl is a great game. If you like American football with slightly less violence, this game is a lot of fun. Strategy reigns supreme, you need to learn the strengths and weaknesses of the various teams and take advantage of them. For example, the Elve teams tend to be great at running and throwing the ball, able to easily and quickly score touchdowns if allowed to remain on their feet, while races like the Dwarves take the slow and steady approach to (literally) steamrolling enemy teams as they make a group push towards the end zone. Killing the enemy team outright is a viable option and some races such as Chaos and the Orcs depend on incapacitating the enemy team to make up for a lack of a strong passing or high defenses like the Dwarves.The dice gods, as always in Games Workshop properties, ultimately reign supreme in Blood Bowl. The best laid plans can still go all wrong, and that is part of the fun because it will happen to your opponents as often as it happens to you. There ARE steps you can take to minimize the impact of the random number generator though, in the form of bribes to the referees, wizards in the audience, etc... In terms of game modes you have a full season Campaign, in which the goal is to win enough regulation games to take part in large tournaments. Over the course of this mode you will draft new players and watch existing ones become better at the game, managing team finances and the players in a meta-game in between actual matches. Also ready for your enjoyment are one-shot tournaments organized by yourself in Competition mode, one-shot games called Exhibition Matches, a Tutorial for new players, and a Story Mode which has you playing with various famous teams over the course of a career as a coach. Lots to do, for sure, and if you like multiplayer there are still many active players online in the matchmaking service. Even if there wasn't though, you could still play over LAN using Hamachi or local hotseat.Overall I do recommend the game, and I hope whenBlood Bowl 2comes out they attempt to keep it contained to fewer iterations. I doubt they will though based on the last run... The good news is that Chaos Edition is the final version of this run, so if you see it on sale and you like turn based strategy games with a lot of over-the-top sports humor thrown in, you can't go wrong with Chaos Edition. It feature local hot seat play, so even if people stop playing it online you can still play it with your friends in your own home a lot cheaper than you could by buying the actual board game."

It's definitely a game about minimizing your chances at failing, it's part of the strategy and you can use it against your opponents.Personally, I like playing the Ogre team. They don't seem like a serious team, but fielding 6 big guys really puts the hurt on the enemy team. Every injury is like an extra point in my book."

Every time I start describing the experience of carefully selecting a team, training them, picking a sponsor and selecting your per-game bribes people get excited.  Then people hear that in every match there's a chance that your entire team will be injured or killed after gaining valuable experience points.  People's eyes tend to glaze over at this point.It's the violence and death that make the multiplayer and campaign so good.  You know that every match will be brutal and chance as much as skill will turn the tide of victory.  Seeing the crowd turn on your opponent to tear them to shreds on a bad play or watching your own blocker critically fail a roll and bounce off the other teams ball carrier like the dude is made of force fields are just flipsides of the same coin.You can be good at this game or bad.  Awesome or terrible.  In the end this game is like all true Games Workshop titles.  Skill is irrelevant.  The fun is in the stories you get to tell later about the crazy stuff that happened on the dice rolls and how they played out.  Play it with friends or enemies or the exceptionally active Blood Bowl community on Steam if you like, but understand that winning and losing aren't super important.

A lot of fun and just evil to the bone.Smash or even try to kill your opponents player - since a touchdown doesn't have to be scored in the beginning. If the other team no longer has players on the field, you just walk to the finish line.The PC game has everything the original board game has to offer and with the possibility to play against opponent around the world, its so easy to play games. It has a little bit of randomness and luck in it, since you roll dice to play, but a good tactic and the right decisions is almost as equally important.Choose your team from all the Warhammer nations and groups and use their advantages against your enemies.Frustration can happen since even your starplayer, you build up in many games, can eventually die, but that's just how Blood Bowl works and why its not called Candy World or Sugar Bowl.As the only two negative points (from my point of view) are:- the high price of the game (but worth it)- time consuming of it, since one game goes at least 40min and there are no savepoint during a gameI still play the board game, but the PC version is as fun and great as well"

It is a hardcore strategy: it's unforgiving, ugly, and you do need to learn quite a lot.

But man, this game is rewarding as hell.Once you get to the point, where you undestand basci tactics, and concepts, you can start playing the really interesting teams. The game itself has an incredible variety just from the tactics available. Add the 25 race, the leveling system, for each player individually, multi player, tournaments, single player campaign, and you can easily put in 100 hours into this game, if you ever get bored.If you don't have any other Blood Bowl game, I recommend starting here. Buying the 2nd, is a waste of money, that game doesn't deserve to be called Blood Bowl. Buying the Legendary and saving 10 euros is something, but the three races are well worth it, believe me.For learning, I recommend cKnoor's youtube channel, he made some tutorials for beginners, and has a lot of gameplay uploaded, you can learn a lot from him.

This is gonna be a weird review for me - since I'm on one hand going to praise it to heaven, and on the other, slam the developer for being bad.About the game: Blood bowl is a turn-based mix between chess, american football and warhammer fantasy. You get over 20 races to pick from, with different players, each with their own stats and starting abilities. A lot of the game is based on dice-rolls, with modifiers, so that you can 'control' the risks you take with each dice roll. And it is a risk each time. Because failing the roll can often end your turn.So, the good part: The game feels awesome, the wealth of different races, abilities, etc. are great, the rules are well-fleshed out, and some of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t that can happen, if you are lucky enough, is amazing (If a bit infuriating for the one losing because of it). What I'm saying is, basically: The boardgame is AMAZING, and the idea of having a digital version, that does all the dice-rolls and remembers all the rules about dodging, throwing, catching, blocking, etc. for you, is nice.Now for the bad part: Cyanide, the developer.Basically, this game is just not well made. You'll constantly ask yourself what the hell went through the developers mind when they made it like this. All the parts that is the game itself is brilliant, since it's a straight copy of the boardgame, but stuff like the interface, the online lobby system, the terrible path-finding, the few bugs, graphical choices, there's so many times when you just don't understand why they made it like they did.Conclusion: I still love this game to death. Cyanide didn't ♥♥♥♥ up enough that I don't love it. There's luckily not that many bugs left, and the game itself functions well enough. You'll just have to get past the stupid design decisions first.TL:DR This game is awesome, if you love Turn Based Strategy, Warhammer, and violent sports. Developer is a Piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥"

It is, however, arguably the best way to play the board game Blood Bowl over the internet.  Fumbbl, while a wonderful community, is built around an application that experiences server-wide glitches between patches that affect the meta of entire leagues.  I respect people who play on Fumbbl, and in many ways prefer the simple sprite-based interface.  However, Chaos Edition includes a tutorial and single player modes to ease new players into the game.For a time, I refused to purchase any version of Cyanide's Blood Bowl after the barebones 2009 version.  Both 2009 Blood Bowl and Blood Bowl II force changes from the source material into the core game, whereas Legendary and Chaos Edition limit these changes to an alternate mode called ""Blitz.""Something to always keep in mind is that Cyanide's Blood Bowl is not an original game, but an adaptation.  Chaos Edition is the most accurate and accessible verion of the board game.Edit: It is worth noting that Legendary Edition is functionally the same, save for the new playable races, and I believe it can even play with Chaos Edition players.  So, if you main a race included in Legendary Edition, you might be able to get by with a cheaper purchase.  Additionally, the inclusion of Khorne Demons without something closer to base/accepted game like the Slann is a little disappointing.  However, that disappointment pales in comparison to the inclusion of Bretonnia in Blood Bowl II before the addition of staple teams like Undead and Nurgle.  Granted, both Bretonnia and Khorne Demons seem well balanced/tested and were adapted (with liberties) from a certain Fumbbl format."

What Games Workshop has left is arbitrary dice rolling, which has even been dilluted to the point where the player cannot see the dice unless certain circumstances apply, and long waits for opponents.If one is looking for an initial indicator of game quality, the tutorial is usually an excellent place to start. Blood Bowl takes enough time to get in a little of the flavor of the world in which it is built, but decides to leave out little details like rules beyond the basics one might expect from a primer on American Football for 3 year olds, (Ball goes in the end zone, tackling players good, getting injured bad) while blatantly telling the player that if they want to know more, they should look it up.One might accept that story mode is in fact the true tutorial, since the first mission is simply to finish a game, regardless of win or loss, as though testing a players patience for the slow, laborious plodding of the computer. While the second mission is to throw 2 goblins, with no instructions on how to do so. It becomes more frustrating once you find out how to do so, since in order to accomplish this seemingly simple task, a player must actually overcome 2 phantom dice rolls in addition to simply having the necessary pieces available.Ultimately Blood Bowl takes what promised to be an exciting, comedic romp through a well established and lore filled world, and turn it into a distillation of the worst elements of a table top miniatures game with poor camera angles and repetetive dialouge."

If you're still with me after that little description, then maybe Blood Bowl is for you.You start the game by selecting a team of bloodthirsty monsters from the Warhammer universe. Each race plays a little differently. The Orcs want to bash their opponents into the dirt. The Elves want to dodge around and make big passing plays. The Goblins have a bunch of dirty tricks up their sleeves. You choose your name, logo and colour and then you begin.The first time I played, I got completely thrashed by the computer. There is a learning curve present but there are plenty of guides online and a big community of players who can give you some pointers. Leveling up your guys in the right way is a big part of the game. Some skills like Block and Dodge are a must, other skills like Pass block are only used in specific circumstances and best saved for later.The sound is satisfying. The commentators are hilarious. I though the graphics were fine. It's an older game from a smaller studio, so I wasn't expecting much. There is a nice variety of units in the game. The Chaos Edition comes with 23 teams and there is plenty of single player content here to play around with if you want to avoid the highly competitive online scene. Some guys have been playing the board game since the 80s and will mop the floor with newer players.I'm loving Blood Bowl so far. Anyways, I've got to get back to trying to take my team ""The New Ork Ragerz"" to the Blood Bowl final."

It is actually with a very heavy heart that I can actually give it a thumbs down. I am torn and seriously torn at this. I have had a lot of great moments, but a lot of bad moments as well. The problem with this game is in its entire appeal to RNJesus. If you love dice rolling games with a twist of strategy, then this is for you. If you are a diehard strategy nerd, then this game will leave you bitter when the opposing team kills 2 of your star players and then procedes to dodge the rest of your team into a touch down after 3 turns of you rolling 2 attacker downs.The temple of RNG is that of a 6 sided die where 1s are always failures and 6s are always successes. You can stack it in your favor where 2-6 is a success or a 6 is the only success, but you must realize that means there is always a possibility of 17% failure. To me, this is the deal breaker. This to me, breaks the game. This is akin to munchkin(a fine game in certain lights) which can be fun light-heartedly, but if I were to rank this game amongst other strategy games, it has to get the thumbs down.This game does have many strategic aspects and so I thoroughly enjoy it for a Saturday sitdown, but the mental engagement is severally lacking. You can even tell since the AIs only ability to perform better is through just giving it more perks than you. This always leaves a fairly sour taste in my mouth, but I can usualy power through it if the game plays if engaging enough. This game play isn't.So for the TLDR crowd, if you want an RNG game that mimicks strategy, get this game. If you actually like strategy games, then this game is a no for me."

But this nonsense is suspicious.Every time I get close to winning a match, on easy mind you, things start to go spastic. For example, 0-0 and in the second half, RNG going my way then the AI's, then back again, etc. With the ball two squares from the line, all of a sudden things take a turn for the worse! An enemy zombie is able to go through three red spots, THREE! and picks up the ball. My counter attack with a troll next turn resulted in nothing but red skulls, and for the next three turns in a row, my various counterattacks against said zombie, all resulted in red skulls. Every. Single. One. Even my re-roll. Once the zombie passed the ball to something else and scored, miraculously RNG went normal again, but by then it was too late.Another good example was that one other time I almost won a match on easy. I made the decision to make a roll for an extra square, given that extra square would put me in the try zone. but failed and fell over. Fair enough, that's RNG. For the next three turns however, my high-agility skaven with extra hands and 2+ chance to pick up, fumbled the ball. In those three turns, two human players were well within reach to blitz me, or even move up to block my movement. But they just stood there watching my skaven suddenly become as nifty as a drunken troll's fart.All-in-all, this game would be amazing if it wasn't so blatantly bull even on easy.

However I can't really recommend it based on it's history.Let me explain. Originally Cyanide produced a game called Chaos League (with an expansion called Sudden Death) which was a direct take off of Bloodbowl the board game. After a big legal dispute with games workshop they ended up developing Bloodbowl the computer game.The trouble is that I don't think this is an improvement on Chaos League. It's biggest advantage is that you can play it online. However otherwise it's not an improvement and in some regards is worse. Personally I think Chaos League is more fun.Where it falls down in comparison to Chaos League is the dice rolls.  Unlike the boardgame version the dice rolls that the AI makes are suspiciously unrandom. e.g. There should be a 1-6 chance of a fumbled throw but my experience of this was far more frequent (6 times in a row once), the AI rarely fails it's dodge rolls etc and simply put the die rolls often don't seem random, certainly I've never seen dice come up with the same results so often in real life.To my mind another advantage of chaos league is you have the option to play a real time option which you can pause (Which personally I prefer) which allows you to plan your moves and is useful if you want to stop mid-game for any reason. Games also last longer and don't have half time, so no irritating half time whistle just when you were about to score.Chaos League also has the option to buy and develop star players for each race, which are a lot of fun. But you don't get them in Bloodbowl, I also prefer some elements of the layout in Chaos league and some of the little touches such as when a player is killed a little tombstone appears on the pitch and the players spirit is seen departing into the ether. There are a few minor tweaks and improvements in Bloodbowlbut not enough to make it a better game.Overall if you want to play against friends I'd say buy the board game. If you want to play against the computer I'd buy Chaos league (Sudden death edition) it's simply more fun and you won't find yourself swearing at the compurter as much. If you want a strategy game buy football manager. I'd only buy this if you intend to play online."

Unless you're the kind of person who can handle losing to the AI more often than not (even on Easy difficulty) don't bother with Blood Bowl. This game requires equal degrees of strategic brilliance and utter masochism to be enjoyed. Fans of the game insist the AI doesn't fudge dice rolls in its favor but I'm not so sure on that considering that the AI players almost always make successful dodge rolls regardless of Agility. But, even if it doesn't cheat, this is hardly a relaxing game experience and seems to be aimed at people who enjoy ungodly difficulty.I really gave this game the best chance that I could, playing hotseat matched against myself until I was certain I understood the rules before moving on to play the AI. Ultimately I clocked in about 22 hours of play over the course of five days before deciding to request a refund. That's the other thing, even if the difficulty and very steep learning curve aren't a problem for you this game simply isn't worth the $30 price tag. I wish I could've enjoyed this game, it's very charming and you can tell the people who made it were fans of the original board game but (call me crazy) I think life is frustrating enough without something that's supposed to be for entertainment frustrating you further.

With that fanboy garb set aside, really looking at the game there are tons of issues for new players and people who just want to have fun, not have to rage about cheap and unfair AI. The AI's dice rolls being rigged are the most frustrating part of the game bar none. If not for these rigged single player settings the game could be real fun. I have no problem with RNG in games in fact I love that aspect, however, this is not the case here. Yet again alot of fanboys and other will continuiously state that it is not rigged, that people just dont understand the brutality of RNG and statistics. but, I do thats the problem, and thats why I know that the game is rigged. In conclusion I would rate this game a 2 out of 10, some people may like the way the game AI cheats, but I think most casual gamers playing on easy just want to enjoy their experience when playing.

The amount of times you seem to fail die rolls while the computer doesn't will aggravate you to no end until you understand all of the rules of the game, at which point the AI will be a pathetic competitor, providing no challenge at all.  Given all that, you can still get many hundreds of hours out of it, fine tuning your strategy in single player, playing many different races in many different manners.The online league interface is unfortunately a little haphazard.  League management controls are somewhat limited and not as fleshed out as I'd like them to be, but it's entirely serviceable.  Random online matchmaking does exist, but you'll notice that the matching system isn't based upon skill as much as it is based upon cheesing the system, by using teams at their specific overpowered points in the rankings.  Really where the game shines is in a league setting with 16 or more like minded individuals in a structured season/playoff format.  I ran an online league for several seasons, and most of the guys would agree it was an incredible amount of fun, even when their team was getting destroyed.It is a pretty niche game, but if you fit that niche, you will enjoy it to no end.

,Recommended,216890,17993870,"Posted: 11 September, 2015",all,Ogulus The Indifferent,"7/10Blood Bowl is a fun, if frustrating, PC version of the classic table top game. If you enter it with the expectation that it will be funny and a catastrophy, then you'll probably have a good time. If you think it'll play like an actual ball game, then you'll probably hate it.The Run Down: There are two types of teams: teams that smash and teams that play ball well. My recommendation is to start with a team that smashes well, such as The Undead, Necromantic, or one of the Chaos/Nurgal/Khorne teams. Everything is done by D6 rolls, so you will fail constantly at everything. You'll fail at picking up a ball that your players surround, you'll fail at throwing a ball to a player two inches away, and you'll fail at smashing a player 1/4 your size and strength. Luckily, the other team fails at an equal rate. Even on ""Easy"" this game is challenging. I picked this up in that massive developer pack with Styx, and this is one of the few games in that huge pack that's worth anything at all.Try it out."

When a game developer has enough contempt for their audience to use the tutorial for a relatively complex game to teach the bare minimum and tell the player to read the (sizeable) rule book if they want to understand anything beyond this, they're obviously in the wrong business.If you're already a fan of the tabletop Blood Bowl, this game is a faithful recreation (so far as I can tell) and you'll probably love it.

I picked it up in the Steam sale for £4.99 (iirc) and for that money I would say ""don't miss it!"". Turn based, simple concept, yet very complicated in the hands of skilled players, it's a rare game which has a long term draw. A cursory understanding of dice probability will be of huge help for those (like me) who might quit in a rage with the words ""cheating computer!"" when it seems like the AI teams are always passing their dice checks and I always fail mine! (it only seems that way!)Long term players unanimously denounce the single player AI as useless although coming almost from fresh I'll say it's enough to give you the basic concepts and will punish mistakes. There are plenty of online leagues for you to cut your teeth on  and there is a healthy fan-base of regular players - the ideal place to learn not to get too attached to your players ;)If you are looking at this and wondering whether to get it or Blood Bowl 2, I'll have to say I'm a little torn myself. There are plenty of threads for comparisons, but I think the key point is that those who have played these old editions are happy with where the balances are and the content (EVERY team). The new game (BB2) has changed a lot of things and in some areas this has actually broken some of the game blance, but someone completely new to Blood Bowl might not actually be affected by this. And the devs are finally listening to customer feedback and implementing some good positive changes.For me it comes down to price though.  The game is like chess, in that while it's a simple concept, in the hands of good players it develops layers of intelligent enjoyment which the new version simply glosses up. if this turns up in the sale again grab it - and remember - those dice rolls really are random!  ;)"

Every action you perform in this game, like picking up a ball, running with the ball, puching an opponent etc. requires you throw a dice to check for success in performing that action.

Want to see a game of Werewolves vs Orks? How about Elves vs Dwarves? Just another day in Bloodbowl.The game, like its tabletop equivalent, is centered entirely around six-sided die rolls to determine the results of actions. While many different strategies can be applied to win games (ranging from the ""long pass,"" the ""passing train,"" or ""KILL THEM ALL"") and you'll surely find one suited to your style. The factions are diverse and the differences between them are meaningful, leading to a fun experience where you'll want to try out every faction, just to see what it's like!That being said, the game is very unforgiving. On a six-sided die, you will roll a surprising amount of fails. While this is just a part of the game, it's can be quite frustrating to new players, and there is a definite learning curve that one has to get past before you can really appreciate the depth of the game. Another thing that can be quite frustrating is that players from your team (and the enemy team) can get injured, sometimes permanently, which in tournaments can be devastating. Still, it's all part of the game, and you'll surely learn to love it as i did!If you love turn-based RTS games, or have a macabre fantasy of ""what would football be like if it was extra violent?"" then this is definitely a ""must try."""

There are two modes, one which is faithful to the board game; ""Classic"" and one more suited to a PC game; ""Blitz""Classic is very freaking difficult initially without having read the charts in the manuals. It's turn based and you hand control to the opposition every time something fails. Which at first  is often. Really often. I think it took 4 hours before I scored. After 25 or so I'm giving them a good spankingBlitz is easier, but the game adds a twist. I had won every game, advanced players through several levels, completed a season and it crashed. Without a save game. Started over and it crashed again after about 3 matches. And again without ever saving a game automatically to the point where if I ever meet a wood elf I will punch it in the face just on general principles. Classic seems to be completely stable, maybe it's a side effect of Blitz?

If you turn away for a moment and look back, you could be expected to make a timed decision, but the game will not tell you what kind of decision you are supposed to be making.  The training system is a complete disaster: First, there is nothing to tell you to click the stop button, second, the UI is employed as a device to keep you from attempting a re-roll without using control-alt-delete.  There are no multiple saves, so if you accidentally click the ""save wtihout quitting"" rather than the ""quit without saving"" button, then your campain is screwed.  No confirmation what-so-ever.  There is no menu command to quit the game without passing through several loading screens first.  These are a few examples, but the UI suffers from other confusing issues as well and is a complete catastrophe.Its unfortunate because the game seems like it would be fun to play otherwise.  After being forced to re-roll my team from scratch 5 times due to UI blunders, I'm disinclined to play and uninterested in purchasing again in the future."

Wait for a sale, this is a ten dollars game, in my opinion, although companies will always value themselves higher. The product itself is only worth ten dollars though because there is a definite learning curve, if you've never played Blood Bowl (which feels like a chore having to adapt to) and it's just not a game that keeps me coming back like a Crusader Kings 2 or Total War game would. I rarely play this game, although when I do, I usually do have a long session with it.Once you get the hang of this game, there is a strategic experience to it like in Total War where I have to attack enemies from the side or block certain people from advancing so they don't score. It isn't as fun though unless you're playing as a team like the Orcs who can just clothesline an entire team of Elves. I highly recconmend playing as the Orcs if you're a beginner because they're so strong and they're very reliable. They also cause the other team far more injuries or even deaths than you'll sustain so at the very least, if you lose, they'll be in the hospital for the next morning, sipping through a straw because their jaw is broken (another person is holding the cup because their arms are also broken), while attending the funeral of their fallen Elf teammate who tripped and died on his own without being touched by anyone (that actually can happen in this game and it is hilarious).I have a serious problem with the format of the Blood Bowl though. Here's my proposal. Watch the show Battle Bots and that's how the Blood Bowl should go. You should just pick a race and not have to worry about building a solid team because you already start out with the best since they're represting their race and then from there, you play a starting match like a preseason to rank the teams and sort out who's the strongest and then from there, you make a thrity two team braceket that the player can view where the #1 ranked team faces the #32 ranked team and #1-4 are all in different sections of the bracket (look up the Battle Bots bracket) and then from there all the teams play (the player can just watch games if they want) and as soon as the bracket starts, if you lose, you're out, until only two teams stand. This game is the Blood Bowl and it will take place in a huge arena with a huge audience. The winner will then be awarded a blood bowl trophy with a roman numeral on it to symbolize what bowl it is. This would be a way more enjoyable and competitive experience.Lastly, my final criticism is that there are not enough turns in a half. Not even close. At most, with the Orcs, who're a very physcial team, you'll get two points in a game and that's only because you returned a fumble for a touchdown. I've had far too many games end 1-0 because I stopped them from scoring but they couldn't stop me in my half. The small amount of turns really does cripple the experience."

All you can do is watch the match in real time. you can slow down and speed up a bit, but that's not that useful. Full control would be awesome; a pause button would make it a meaningful feature.You can change player names, apparently. You have to do it before you buy the player, you can never change it again, and you have to go into the player's detail screen. As far as I know, there is absolutely no reason to look at this screen before you buy a player, except that it's the only way to change the name. It'd be nice to just click on the name of the player I'm about to buy to get an input cursor. You know, like every other windows application ever.Dice are still broken. When it's one player vs. another, it's fair (if not well-randomized), but it seems that the die rolls in a single-player game take into account the difficulty level.Custom lineups don't save properly. As long as I stay within the same game, the lineup I saved doesn't go anywhere. As soon as I start a new game, it's gone. so there's really no point in using the feature, since you still need to take time to set your line every single game.♥♥♥♥♥♥poor tutorial. Seriously. The tutorial is cute and entertaining, but because it's cute and entertaining, it's not very informative and it takes forever to get through. Seriously, this is the worst in-game tutorial I've ever had the misfortune to sit through.This right-click/left-click♥♥♥♥♥♥has GOT to go. Just get rid of the right-click mechanism entirely. The game doesn't need to tell the difference between a ""move here"" click and a ""select this player"" click because you can only possibly mean one or the other, depending on where you actually click. I suppose this might make sense in a real-time game, but I've yet to encounter anyone who actual plays this game in realtime mode.I think it's great that when a ""new edition"" is released, they very graciously offer a deep discount to anyone who already owns the game. But come on. You're essentially releasing DLC and re-packaging the entire game with each content pack. So when I bought Chaos Edition, I had to download the entire game again, instead of just having to download a patch and a content pack. Can't you just release DLC and regular patches like everybody else does?A spectator mode would be great too. It would be nice to be able to watch a game as it happens and do commentary. There is officially a ""spectator mode,"" but you're not watching the game live. When you enter ""spectator mode,"" it just plays the game's replay from turn one.There are just so many things that everybody else does properly and this game fails at miserably.I love BloodBowl, and I love paying a one-time price to play it forever.

Well, that's a bit of an exaggeration, but still, no block, Strength 3 Armor 7 overall is not what you'd call fighty... still, there is the Bloodthirster.I'd recommend this game for anyone who likes Warhammer, turn based tactics, chess, or comic violence."

Great Game, except when you are trying to do the tutorials, and learning how to play. Its very crappy instruction booklet has rules that dont even apply to this version of the game, and misses out others completely. I love this game. I play alot, and i enjoy the random craziness, of it."

It's part of the fun of Blood Bowl is the RNG that does affect most actions. If you like Warhammer (or the universe associated with it) Buy this. If you like pretty brutal RNG (similar to Xcom's pretty rage-worthy RNG) then you're likely to like this, so get it. Like Online Play, incredibly fun but pretty much dead since Blood Bowl 2 released. Chaos edition has something like 23 teams and it is worth picking up on sale. It's honestly very fun and actually got me into the tabletop version that Games Workshop released around a year ago. Give this a go, and give it some patience and like me you may find yourself sinking more than a few hours into it.Or you know, you could just quit after one match and refund the game.Oh and, Blood Bowl 2 exists (like I previously mentioned) and has a much higher polish, nicer graphics and some pretty cool added elements, though is essentialy the same game with less races and higher requirements.Oh and for anyone who decides to get the game, treat every dice roll as if it will fail, prepare for it and you will generally do much better."

This game has two distinct parts, the dating and the Bad Boys Love secret match unlocked by romancing every orc possible!!The first part is simply too short to be entertaining. Any match in Blood Bowl can be played in about an hour going at a relaxed pace, but there is significant overlap between matches, including sections that have no effect on the particular match you're playing, so I found myself skipping more and more as I replayed. This also caused me to inadvertently skip content I hadn't dice rolled before, because some sections have multiple outcomes but start out the same way regardless of match. There is no way to go back to content accidentally skipped without reloading or starting a new game and it simply wasn't interesting enough to worth bothering to find out why I was faced with the choice of telling that one cute Orc with the pigtails ""convenience store"" or ""grocery store"" and I could infer it had something to do with pudding anyway.Consequently, there just isn't enough time to give any character depth and there's no challenge to complete a match. By the time you finish a match, you feel like you were merely introduced to the team. Picking matches is also very obvious and there is never any difficulty in seducing the various orcs, unless you can't figure out that picking every opportunity to spend time with your desired orc is necessary to romance them. The matches I enjoyed most against Bonecrusher, Fister, and Anghel, stood out because they were simply the most oddball. For a game that is billed as an orc romance game, most matches utilize stereotypical melodrama. Orc puns and poop culture references abound, but there's really nothing laugh out loud funny in Blood Bowl and at best you'll smirk a lot.All in all, Blood Bowl wasn't an altogether terrible game, but it just wasn't worth the money and I got it in a 50% off sale. I will likely never play it again and would forget about it entirely if Steam didn't keep it in my library forever. As some consolation, the sexy trading cards were surprisingly valuable and I was able to quickly sell them for about $1000.If you don't mind a lot of repetition, love Blood Bowl no matter what, and really love silly gimmicks, then buy this game. Otherwise, pick up just about any other RnG game on Steam. Even some of the free ones are more entertaining than Blood Bowl4/ORC"

It lacks the Slann/Chaos Pact teams but does come with the unique Khorne team to compensate. Beyond this, it's Blood Bowl at its most accurate, and a lot less expensive than the real thing."
