Hope a lot more gets fixed during the early access phase.Pros:+ Huge replay-ability+ Beautiful Visuals+ Nodes offer great challenge+ Lots of smart additions to the original+ Challenging arenasCons:- Same terrible song over and over (worse than all songs from the original)- Audible triggers and queues are tough to distinguish- Loadout section makes no sense at all- Cubes seem nearly impossible to kill nowWish List:- Explanation of the loadout screen- Make killing cubes a bit easier (seems like sure death when one shows up)- More track selection, or allow for custom tracks to be added via music folder like GTA5- Multiplayer support- Better sense of accomplishment progressing through the gridOverall, this is one of my favorite twin stick shooters now, but I just hope a few of the cons get fixed up in the upcoming patches.  Keep up the great work devs!"

Can't wait to see how it shapes up over the course of Early Access.Pros:- Faster pace than the original - very frantic and enjoyable in combination with the new shield/energy mechanic- New GRID mode is great- The updated graphics are very shiny!Cons:- I may need new right thumbstick for my 360 controller by the time this game makes it to full release!
76561198025233131,Recommended,217120,23543711,"Posted: 13 June, 2016",all,bairy,"Reviewing Alpha 3.5. This review is most useful if you've played the first Waves, a game I am a huge fan of.Waves (the first one) was a simple twin stick shooter. There were only a few enemy types, a gun, a bomb, slowmo and a few game mechanics. This made it simple fun and you could play for a few minutes or for a couple of hours.Waves squared (this one) is better in almost every way.The same game modes are there, however the game is much faster paced and aggressive now. No more waiting 2 - 3 minutes before it got exciting, now you wait 1 minute and you're swamped. To counter this however you can take a certain amount of damage, rather than the 1 touch kill of the first game. Overall I would say this game is slightly harder because it is so quick. The arenas are no longer round, they're oddly shaped with obstacles that both benefit and hinder you. No longer can you simply run in circles and shoot backwards.The big change is an upgrade system where you can change your primary weapon (the gun), secondary weapon (default: the bomb) and utility (default: the slow motion). This means you can adapt the setup to your specific way of playing, whether it be shooting enemies from across the grid or up close, using slow mo to think or instead an extra shield to take a burst of damage.The game mechanics are about the same but with additions, e.g. collecting data to unlock upgrades, and the tutorial doesn't (yet?) explain everything. Hopefully it will because there are quite a few things going on.Then there's the grid. This is basically challenges. I'm not a big fan but certainly it will appeal to some.All in all this is a good solid easy to pick up game that you can play for 3 minutes at a time or 30. And at it's budget price, it's worth a look if you like the look of the videos.Downsides:1. There is one music track - turn the music off in the options for now.2. Tutorial is basic which will lead to confusion, especailly for those who didn't play the first Waves.3. The upgrades take quite a lot of work to unlock, and there are loads of them. You're gonna need to put in a lot of hours to unlock everything.4. The main menu is really hard to navigate using the gamepad, you need the mouse."

I was wrong.My favorite twin-stick (hell, one of my favorite games). Ever."

It plays fast and smooth just like the original, but exceeds the first games content by leaps. The updates are coming at a good pace and have a good amount of content. The upcoming features that have been mentioned, or already implemented in early stages get me very excited to keep playing in the future. Definitely worth the price of admission."

Hope there will be more optimisation here since it lags really hard.UPD: Thanks, everything is really awesome! Performance is great and I can finally enjoy."
76561198034974020,Recommended,217120,23683761,"Posted: 21 June, 2016",all,Limygeorge,"This game, even as early access is one of the best shooters I've ever played. (I'm not young been gaming for 30 years.)Without doubt anyone who liked Waves original will love this game. It's just better in every way. The same goes for Geometry wars fans, I love that series (Geometry wars 3 was best IMHO) but Waves 2 equals that. It really is that good.The game play itself is fast, frantic, addictive and looks better than most games of this genre.The menus are somewhat confusing at first, but this is offset by the great game play. Arcade is easy to jump into, but other than that the menus are not really intuitive. May seem like a small thing, and the game is still early access so once it's easy to understand all the options it will be much more beginner friendly.I could go on about the game play, but its so much fun it's better to try yourself. Another nice thing rare in this genre is that the game  engine is great and has several graphics options. Maxed out it looks just great. Not sure on minimum spec for maxed out game though. I guess a GTX780 or better would be enough for all settings maxed?I hope this game gets the support it needs. It could be a classic when done and polished.For me personally it already is classic. Quite possibly the best shooter game there is."

Their are elements of strategy by customizing you ship and good diverse level design that makes it exciting.

76561198015399925,Recommended,217120,23411155,"Posted: 5 June, 2016",all,Benefactor,"Waves²  has added some really neat things: a more recent version of the engine, some cool visual effects, more interesting enemy spawn patterns, and crazy awesome abilities. There are a lot of balances changes too, which take time to appeciate but are a net improvement.The progression system and GRID mode seemed somewhat iffy at first, but after playing through them more I like it. I prefer Arcade mode to GRID, but there's nothing forcing you to play GRID since you can earn credits anywhere. It can also be somewhat annoying to be three credits from an 150 upgrade and to know you'll have to do an entire level just to get those three, but overall the progression seems a great speed.Waves² scratched a big itch I didn't know I had with the original, which was the lack of optimization and strategy. The original is still one of the best arcade games of all time, but the added customization offered in this installment really makes the experience extra dynamic.It's still in development, and could use a few more modes and perhaps another enemy type (Boss?) to make it feel even more robust, but the game is great as it is already. Hopefully we see multiplayer co-op and versus at some point, but that may be more of something to expect from Waves: Arena Tactics."

The ruthlessness of the enemies and how chaotic it can get in later levels!  I loved the first Waves... and Waves 2 just took what I loved and improved it!  This game is so worth it and, in my opinion, deserves more notice!"
