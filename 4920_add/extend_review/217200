,Recommended,217200,15987056,"Posted: 24 May, 2015",all,RockstarCRO,"The best Worms game to ever come out - seriously. If you are looking which Worm game to buy first, make it this one. Do not be fooled by my hours on steam, I've spent countless when I first bought the game back in 1999.Worms Armageddon has single player elements and multi player elements to it. Traditionally, Worm games are turn based, and there can be two to four teams present on the battlefield. Each turn, a different worm has a chance to unleash mayhem. The playing terrain can be shot away with and you might find one of your worms just sitting above water, short of drowning. What makes this game dynamic is the multitude of weapons given at your disposal. Super sheep's that can fly through the air, controlled by the player. Holy hand grenades that take away a good chunk of the map. Banana bombs that bounce around everywhere and release more banana bombs. On the map as well, there are randomly placed proximity mines and fire barrels that explode and spread fire when provoked.One player training missions are available and make for a good challenge and breakaway from single player mode. Teams can be customized from grave choice to voice type, even a flag can be thrown into the mix to represent your team. Custom names can also be given to team worm players.This game is a good local game to play with friends, and probably is the only turn based game I'd be willing to play at any time. Absolutely, I would say this game is what made the series.I would like to see maybe in a future Worms' series a real-time worm game rather than turn based. How would that work? Well if I got paid for further suggestions in my reviews I'd share how :).RATING : 8.0/10GameplayAStory / CampaignAVisuals / User InterfaceB+Sounds / MusicB+Replay-abilityA-OverallA"
,Recommended,217200,7768169,"Posted: 26 November, 2013",all,CyrusDrake,"I bought this game on Dreamcast around 1999, not knowing what to expect, which I think allowed me to find hidden gems like Worms Armageddon. I had never played a Worms game before and was on the hunt for any great game in the limited library available on the Dreamcast. Going back to that day, it has been nearly 15 years. It's amazing to think this game still holds up so well. Since then I have played several Worms games, almost all have fallen short of the complexity, difficulty, and variety that WA offered me as a child.This is a great game to play in a room with several people, which may be hard to do on the PC version. Most of those days are lost, but when you try to carefully plan out an assassination, walking and jumping through mines, from perfectly landing Ninja Rope insanity, only to end up undershooting a Holy Grenade and blowing your elite worm 300 yards into the water -- the room of viewers will burst into laughter and you won’t care that you probably lost the game. Moments like these are what make the Worms games so great. The newer Worms games offer online and clan wars, but lets be honest... That is a dull experience in comparison. Online can be fun, don't get me wrong, but it is totally competitive and not intended for newer players.I must also mention in a bit of detail, the Ninja Rope. It has since dramatically changed in all Worms, but in my opinion, not for the better. The classic Ninja Rope took a ludicrous amount of skill and refinement. Not everyone could master it, but those that did, were true bad asses. It is one of the funnest tools in any Worms game, and makes this classic stand out amongst all the sequels. Let me just say, it is a little overpowered. Just like how everyone remembers Quake for ""Rocket Jumping,"" the older Worms games are remembered for Ninja Ropes.The single player in this game was pretty tough, and if you have troubles, check out my video tutorials on completing it (on Steam or YouTube). It is pretty fun though, and teaches you several tricks of the trade. I would say to try and complete the training and a few campaign missions before ever playing online. This should give you the basic understanding of how to utilize your weapons/tools. Then see what people do online to become a pro. It takes some time and patience, but is worth it in the end when you start blowing egos into the water.In short, if you're looking for a massive array of weapons, level designs, laughter, and difficulty -- look no further. This game is amazing 15 years later, and will be in another 15. Give it a try if you've found the newer Worms games a bit too easy or you've never played Worms at all. There’s no other games like them and there’s a reason Team17 (the creator) has prospered all these years as one of the oldest independent game companies around.Graphics:        7/10Sound:            8/10Gameplay:      10/10Replay Value:  9/10---------------------Overall:           9/10"

Plenty of games to join, or host your own.-	Single Player mode, whilst nothing special, is a refreshing diversion. Completing Training Modes, Missions or Deathmatch Games unlocks extra features to tinker around with.-	Thanks to all the updates in the past – you can now play on larger maps, coloured maps, have more worms on each side, and even more things to customise.CONS:-	£10.99 is a very steep price to pay for a game that’s over fifteen years old. Wait for a sale.-	Since Armageddon is released on Steam, it would have been nice to have a selection of achievements and trading cards.Overall score: 93/100"

But, if you pay attention to the reviews, there is a reason for the price.This game holds its weight even after over 15 years.  Extremely fun, very challenging, and a lot of fun to play turn by turn with your spose, children, siblings, friends, be it on LAN or on the same screen together taking turns.This game rivals Chess in its strategy, having so many different variables to use to conquer your opponent, and so many different ways to go about doing so.  The campaign is fun and all, in my opinion, by my greatest pleasure has been playing with friends and family, and in my own time, playing progessive deathmatch against the PC.  Each game you win it gets harder and harder with the odds more against you.Not to mention full custom course creation, as well as team creation.  Name 8 team members and choose the team flag, their accent/voice, and their grave stones for when the lil' guys die for you, even choose the victory song that plays at the end of a match.  Go even further and choose the amount of ammo you start with, what guns you start with, the time for each turn, round, match, falling damage on/off, mine timer duration, crate drop occurence, power of each weapon (nothing better than having a bow and arrow cause more damage than a **HOLY HAND GRENADE** but seriously, this game gives very little limitation to creating the perfect match for you and your friends.2 people left on map in a stalemate, afraid to move.  Sudden Death kicks in, it becomes a race to the top.  10/106 people left on map, a box drops from the sky.  Super banana bomb, it becomes a slaughter!!  10/104 people left on map, you throw a grenade that bounces back on you, and kills your last two guys.  10/10Don't bother yourself with the newer ""3D"" versions of this game.

(Protip: Worms can't swim)The game is 2D and you can only walk to the left and right, and jump. There is a map creator so you wont everrun out of maps, I can also recommend playing on an empty map, just try it, It's fun.Either way, if you are bored and have friends, get this game, play it with them.You won't regret it!

This game will always hold a special place in my gaming experiences.Anyways, the gameplay of this Worms game is probably the best in the series. I'm not just saying that due to nostalgia. After playing Worms 3D, Worms 2 Armageddon, Worms Reloaded, Worms 4 Mayhem, Worms Revolution, Worms Open Warfare, and so on, those all feel inferior to the classic gameplay shown in Worms Armageddon. Bazooka in particular has always felt just write on the 2D landscape in this game. But things like traversing the landscape, setting up traps, and strategizing combos worked well within this gameplay style.Character customization is as charming as ever.

,Recommended,217200,14685282,"Posted: 27 February, 2015",all,Uncle Hammer,"Reviews of old games: are they worth the time to read or write? Most likely not. And a lot of what there is out there is dripping with obvious nostalgia factored in, to the point where it is hard to take anything written as credible (because fan boys are stupid). But this game stands to this day as an example of a game so well designed, it will continue to be playable and should be played until there is a game of this type capable of replacing it (still waiting).While I would have preferred that Worms World Party as available (as it's basically Armageddon with a few extras), this is a rare game indeed. At least for me. Many games that I've poured so much time into I've felt as if I've thrown away my life. So many games have also made me feel like I wish I didn't purchase them (like the majority of my steam library). This game is a rarity because I've enjoyed pretty much every moment of it. For the past 15 years of playing it. Hundreds of hours in Armageddon (not including playtime on steam), double that with World Party. Regrets? Maybe not having enough people to play with in offline multiplayer.While an humongous understatement: This game is excellent.For one, it can run on anything now. The graphics are still excellent, crisp, adorable, and the animations are great... but who cares about such superficial♥♥♥♥♥♥Gameplay is where this game becomes a timeless classic, as it is more or less a game of chess with so much complexity.  It feels like a turn based fighting game, as you need to take out the enemies, while holding favorable ground, and requires a lot of forethought. So many factors have effects on the outcomes of your actions.Many weapons that have different effects, many of which make craters and are (sometimes) accompanied by a blast radius, and depending on how close you hit an opponent, and the incline of terrain they're on, and if there is any overhang or terrain features for them to bounce off, of if there are barrels and mines, the wind, the momentum of their inevitable flights and the possibility of sending one worm into another for a tackle, etc etc long run-on sentence.There is so much to learn, so much to experiment with: I think this game should be available to all school computer labs for little kids just to give them all a good lesson in physics (as well as coming up with creative problem solving).This game is really deep though, and it can actually be very daunting for someone who hasn't put the time to learn all the many facets of this game. Like learning the best digging techniques, how to be mindful of having the proper coverage at the end of your move to mitigate a too severe reprisal, efficient movement and how the terrain can be either helpful or detrimental (I hate you GRASS), how to take advantage of the pleasantly wonky ninja-rope physics, and more.There is a lot you can do with this game, like playing multiplayer (offline is always best, enjoyment is dependent on the number of friends and their willingness to play this game) or deathmatch with the A.I. (at elite level the game becomes a puzzle that changes with every play), or all the fun training modes and missions.A final note: this game is the definintion of replayable.  Randomized maps and with time and practice pulling off perfectly placed shots, this game can lead to awesome and hilarious experiences.I’m going back to putting more time into this gem.  And you should be playing this as well.1 year of Steam version edit:After 1,200 Deathmatch wins, countless hours in local MP practice mode messing with Roping/Super Sheep/other game modes, this is probably my personal favorite game ever."

,Recommended,217200,16667446,"Posted: 23 June, 2015",all,SlyCooperFan1,"I distinctly remember playing (and loving) a game on Nickelodeon's website a long time ago called ""This Means War"", which was an artillery game based off of the show Catscratch. It was the only artillery game I had ever played for a long time, so I had no idea that there was a whole genre of it. A friend of mine introduced me to Worms Armageddon, and I have to say, I love it.The best part about Worms is the worms; they have cute animations, they react in hilarious ways to everything, and they feel like their own characters (especially once you put names to them). The gameplay is also fairly solid; there's no randomness, it's all down to strategy and skill. The multiplayer is relatively active for such an old game, but it's definitely best played with friends.Unfortunately, the game does show its age. The UI can be clunky, and the menu resolution (not the in-game resolution, which is fine) stays very low no matter what. If further patches could be made to revamp the UI, or at least remaster it for higher resolutions, it would be spectacular.Worms Armageddon is a classic in the Worms series as well as the artillery genre in general. For anyone looking for a hilarious time, I definitely recommend it."

I'll just skip that part.While Armageddon is growing a bit dated in its appearance, it is still the best worms Team 17 ever made, in this reviewer's opinion. Out of all the worms games, Armageddon is one of the better games in terms of customization options and number/balance of weapons. It also has great mobility for the worms, including really crazy physics-defying uses of the ninja rope, if you get good at using it. But one of the biggest factors for my preferring Armageddon over all other installments in the worms franchise is the size of the battles. Armageddon lets you create much bigger teams than other Worms games, and you can therefore have a greater number of worms on the map at a given time. This gives you a lot more tactical options per match, but also improves those crazy moments where you explode a holy hand grenade and six worms go soaring through the air in all directions.Armageddon also boasts a really fun and challenging set of story missions that challenge you in a variety of ways. Usually there is either a puzzle element to the mission or else it challenges you to think about a particular weapon or skill in a new way. It is very fun to go on a one-worm infiltration style mission, for example. Or there is another mission where you have one worm with 10hp and have to kill an enemy worm with 150hp who is hiding in an underground cave with no entrances, and you have to figure out how to kill him (without getting killed yourself) within a certain number of turns. It requires a lot of retries and experimentation, but you get it eventually. Challenges like these are an excellent change of pace to the typical all-out deathmatch.Buy W:A and enjoy your holy hand grenade."

,Recommended,217200,9321379,"Posted: 2 March, 2014",all,R7038,"Ohhh Worms Armageddon, you NEED to play this game. Worms is a series that has been going on since the late 90's and this is actually just the third game in the series. Worms is a game where you control (duh) worms and they blow other worms up. The game is turn based and very strategic for how you want to use your turn. With Jet Packs, Ninja Ropes, and Parachutes for traversing terrain, You could go all the way out of your way to kill someone humiliatingly with the prod. Speaking of weapons, this game has a wide variety of weapons. Basic bazookas, grenades, air strikes, etc and then strange weapons like sheep, holy hand grenade, cows and other farm animals fill this game with very diverse weaponising.One of the best parts of Worms Armageddon specifically is the jump from the original and Worms 2 in balance via weapons. My favorite part of Worms Armageddon is the maps, though. Isn't it fun to blow through rubble, detritus and other worms on your way to victory? I think it is. Worms Armageddon has a relative amount of player customization with being able to change custom things such as maps, fanfare, voices (australian, cad, english, Soul Man), gravestones, flags, and worm profile names.Worms Armageddon has a feature of CPU opponents. The CPU's have a AI skill ranging from 1-5. On five, the AI will hit ridiculous wind-targeted rockets and grenades you couldn't have thought as possible. Level 1 CPU's tend to miss and blow themselves in to the water on occasion. If you use a fair weapon variety (my favorite is bazooka, air strike, grenade, shotgun) AI can be a formidable opponent. Oh yeah, SPEAKING of picking what weapons to use, that's another feature called game schemes. If you want to play with banana bombs, holy-hand grenades and armageddons only, then do it. Game schemes are very helpful.This game also has a single player mode, which is training, playing deathmatch vs. computer (VERY HARD AFTER A WHILE) doing missions (Eliminating 18 level 5 CPU's with one worm) and quick, simple games vs cpu. The single player mode is for unlocking small things for the game, such as indestructible terrain, a cheat that makes worms bleed when attacked, and more!For a game from 1999, it may be surprising to find out that it has an online multiplayer mode. If you jump into the land of WormNET, you will find different perspectives of worms armageddon such as Shopper, use ninja ropes and stuff to get crates with weapons, WxW, and Quickdraw. Worms Armageddon is vast worm world. Definitely one of my favorite games of all time."

A mixture of serious and hilarious weaponry, many of which are hidden or unlockable, coupled with a great set of maps to play on make this game a winner. The missions are varied and entertaining, deviating from the standard deathmatch which defines the regular game. Overall, a game that has much replayability, great multiplayer, particularly hotseat multiplayer, and varied and fun action that is easy to pick up but take a while to master."

I still would prefer Worms World Party for more of it's options and nostalgia (I played WWP more than WA). In my honest opinion, this game had the most unique arsenal of weapons and the best physics for them. No matter what the newer games do, you cannot replicate the feel of this game's Ninja Rope in any other. Overall, best 2D Worms game next to Worms World Party."

(Also the n64 version of this game certainly has controller support which could have been transfered easily to the pc version.

You take turns angling and firing all kinds of different weapons in deathmatches, but I didn't remember all of the controls.The options menu has no way to change, or view the controls, nor does the basic training. The basic training is just a series of missions where it tells you to do something, but doesn't give you ANY inkling of how. I haven't played this game in over a decade, I don't remember how to open up the weapons menu. But if you don't figure it out in time, you fail the basic training mission, and have to go back not to the start of the mission, but three missions back. I can't even fathom what absolute moronic ""game designer"" thought that was a good idea. If you do two missions, and fail the third because of an unfair time limit, zero explaination of the controls, and zero guidance on how to use them.Seriously, I'm dropped into a BASIC TRAINING mission, where I need to reach a crate, and two targets on platforms slightly above me. It explains that I can use an uppercut to reach them. But if you use said uppercut, it's not nearly high enough to reach, and you've used up your single punch you get for that mission and fail. Now you need to complete the two previous missions to get back to this point and figure out what you did wrong. How am I supposed to figure out that not only do you need to jump, but you need to DOUBLETAP backspace (Which isn't even the jump key), and then hit space to double backflip, and then at the peak of your jump, use the uppercut? On top of that, the training missions are MANDATORY in order to play the real missions, and I STILL don't know how to open the weapons menu.So I'm sitting here, having only played for less than thirty minutes, and I'm frantically searching the internet on how I do absolute basic, and mandatory things like jumping, and opening the weapons menu.It's tragic, I have so many fond memories of this game, but back in the day, my friend introduced it to me and told me all the controls. Trying to learn the basic controls of this game is the biggest ""F-You"" I've EVER seen in gaming in my entire life.Buy this game for the nostalgia, but new players, stay the HELL away."

Secondly once you get the game working the controls are pretty retro and can't be rebinded. I'm running at 2560x1440 and the game displays fine at that resolution however, the aiming seems to be off slightly and I can only assume that its down to higher modern resolutions. The menus are all really low resolution which is something I don't care for but I guess thats a personal preference. There is also content missing, I was wanting to use the scottish voices but they are not in the steam version along with about 5 others. So you need to download them all and place them in the appropriate directory. Back in 2012 There were promises being made that the game would be updated for modern OS's and key rebinding would be implemented, it's now March 2015 and they haven't lifted a finger so I think it's fair to say they have forgotten about it :(Worms Amageddon was a good game in its day, but the developers just seem to be doing a cash grab putting it on steam in it's original untouched version without optimising or updating it."

It never tells you how to change fuse settings, nor even how to aim or fire. A tutorial should, at the minimum, assume you have never played the game, nor any like it, nor any game at all. It should be insulting in how little it assumes you know.I would love to play this game, but I don't have the patience to figure everything out on my own in a freaking tutorial that should be telling me how to play. I'm certainly not going to spend the two hours I get before being unable to refund the game figuring out if I can learn how to play the tutorial.

If you have friends or family willing to play this game with you, it's definitely worth grabbing during a sale.I will say that the controls are very confusing and can be difficult to learn, especially as there is nothing in the way of even a very basic tutorial or instructions screen. Once you do figure out the controls though, you can have a lot of fun with this- in multiplayer mode.As a single-player game, however, it's a completely different animal. It's enjoyable at first, but over time becomes more and more frustrating until it just feels indescribably awful. This is the only game I've ever played where you can claim that the computer cheats and not necessarily be wrong. Just...don't."

I honestly think that the game is dated today, and would only suggest this if you have nostalgia for the classic Worms games. Otherwise, check out the other games in the series on Steam.If you don't like the fact I have no nostalgia for this game and mechanically didn't like it, that's my opinion.

Although being an older game the graphics are not an issue. They are cartoonish and still look good today. The gameplay is smooth and free of bugs which I have always found to be a sign of a well made game. I would say this game is quite worthwhile especially while on sale.

You have a bunch of cute little worms, with cute little physics-based weapons (well, sometimes they're not so little), trying to destroy each other. It's brilliant because it's ridiculously fun for both casual and hardcore gamers. The hardcore gamers get their kicks from practising their technique until they become unstoppably accurate with all their shots, whereas the causal gamers simply enjoy the trial-and-error fun of shooting bazookas at each other.That's the entire Worms franchise. All the Worms games are more or less like this: quality games that are more or less interchangeable. That being said, I would have to say that Worms Armageddon is the best Worms game so far. It has a wide variety of weaponry, a huge capacity for customisation (although you need to beat the game to get the full options), very accessible level editor, interesting missions, training that is actually fun, as well as a ""deathmatch"" mode that is fun, intense, and has never since been replicated.Although these are petty concerns, where WA falls short is in two respects: a slight lack of help in how to play the game, and in its online community. I found that, when I first played WA (when it came out), it was difficult to figure out all the little controls. There are two jump buttons, and pressing or double pressing produces different jumps, which was confusing at first. Also, customising grenades, such as changing the fuse time or making them bouncy, was never clearly explained. If you buy this game, consult the following page:http://wormsarmageddon.team17.com/main.html?page=abou&area=contMost of the necessary controls you can pick up in the game, but the page is a useful reference when you really want to nail down your grenade shots or your ninja roping.The other problem, as I mentioned, was the online community. When last I checked, WA had an entrenched and hostile online community, where the standard was absurdly high, and anyone not of this standard was abused and/or dropped from games. But, so long as you play with friends, this shouldn't be a problem."

The worm customization system is nicely in-depth, and while it lacks the more exotic options available in more recent games, such as optional hats and worm skin colours, it makes up for it with team size options of up to 8 worms on a team in combat, although this goes down when you have three or more players simply due to the size of the levels themselves.Also, protip: If you want to stay friends with someone, NEVER play against them on a bridge level.

,Recommended,217200,3973216,"Posted: 28 February, 2013",all,Travis.touchdown,"Boy, was I excited when the latest Worms installment ""Worms Revolution"" had been announced. 2010's ""Worms Reloaded"" – while not terrible by any means – didn't manage to meet the high standards of the classic titles like ""Armageddon"" or ""World Party"". It was obvious that it had been designed with the arcade or mobile audience in mind, who don't desire a lot of customization. It was basically a PSP port (""Open Warfare 2"" from 2007) with just a few tweaks, and it did show!Cutting to the chase, ""Worms Revolution"" turned out to be a disappointment on almost all levels, BUT the best thing about pre-ordering it was the free copy of 1999 classic ""Worms Armageddon""! In contrast to the watered-down ""Revolution"" ""Armageddon"" lets you customize almost every single aspect of the game – From weapon power, crate contents and choosing random or timed mines to the number of landscape objects or the probability level of first aid kit drops: Every player was able to tailor his very own game modes and this led to a huge variety of amusing play styles, which could also be experienced in the game's online multiplayer mode.Speaking of online, Armageddon's online community is still very strong after all these years. I've been playing this game 200+ (!) hours within the last few months and there was never any shortage of online opponents.I can understand Team17 were trying a reboot with ""Revolution"", attempting to appeal to younger players. It's not a bad game on its own merits. But if you do know ""Armageddon"" or ""World Party"" it's just inevitable to scratch your head over some of the design choices they've made on ""Revolution"". It's just incomprehensible that ""Armageddon"", a game from 14 years ago, feels superior and is in fact more feature-packed than the latest offering.So, if you want a classic and complete Worms experience, I suggest skipping every franchise title made past 2001 altogether and get ""Worms Armageddon"" or ""Worms World Party"". Both are equally good, but to my knowledge ""Armageddon"" has the stronger online community.""Armageddon"" is currently not available to purchase via Steam. I hope this will change in the near future. It really deserves to expand its audience."

I mean the game is older than steam and still on times costs more than cs. But now enough advertising.Graphics: Seriously i believe those worms are pretty done for. they dont look too happy but thats not why they enter the arena.

The game Is quite old but holds up well and has a lot of fun things you can do like training, battles and missions. With lots of fun little sounds and animations.pros: Easy to learn and some what hard to master. Fun animations and sounds that makes this game fun for pretty much any age. The game has more depth then what appears on the surface. The mechanics are good for the most part and the physics are developed in a way that even if they aren't perfect they are very fun.cons: The graphics are not good which isn't a problem for me but may be to some people. The game is quite old and some people may prefer more modern games for the graphics and things like that. There is no story so if you looking for a game with story this is not for you."

I have the original CD distro of this game in my collection, and during my heyday back then, I was a terror with many of the weapons. Bazooka, Grenade, Rope, the tutorials and challenge missions provided really push you to get good at handling even the most basic of weapons effectively.The fundamentals of Worms turn-based gameplay in this classic edition are rock-solid and certainly extremely comparable to even Worms 2, which had some customization superiority over Armageddon, but in many other ways, it surpasses W2. Optimizations in engine, refined controls, and improved sounds and music help cement Armageddon as THE game of choice. The greatly-improved ability to import images to convert into custom levels helps extend the already-legendary amounts of replay value this game offters.Don't look at my hours on record, I have prior experience easily exceeding hundreds of hours on older pre-Steam hardware mastering this game, and will gladly affirm that this old game has stood the test of time and remains an excellent choice for mayhem.Well, why are you reading this?

The singleplayer is pathetic, the graphics are bad, the lag in local area networks is annoying... the only fun that this game gives you, is what you do with your friends with it, but in that regard, it's a 1000 times better party game then anything Nintendo ever made... and i usually love Nintendo stuff...Imagine a turn based game like smash, where everyone got 4 - 6 Nintendo guys, and then you blow each other up with bombs and stuff... (I wish)That's really a genre that could profit from those 20 year old mechanics. While in smash, you just mash buttons and everything is over in no time, without anyone knowing who even killed whom, in Worms, everyone gets to watch every piece of the action. If someone did a realy sneaky move, to do something to you or your other opponent, then you will know it, you will see it, and you will get mad or laugh your♥♥♥♥♥off about it.After the fight, you take a minute to start a new game, and in that minute, your friends and you can actually talk about what happened... people plan revenge... people plot things... Unlike in Smash like games, where after the fight, nobody know who killed whom, and you just start the next game, with again, everyone just mashing buttons, like last rounds...If you are able to play this game locally, or with a voice setup with friends, it's one of the best game that you can quickly bring up and play for a few minutes or hours. Without the social aspect of... you know... trust and betrayal etc... there won't be much fun in this game for you."

The newer ones currently traded a few weapons, tools and customizables for better graphics and physics. Worms Armageddon is a turn-based, 2D competitive game that will not disappoint, but be warned, this is a game that came out in 1999 so it's a bit dated and this pc port does not cooperate with certain hardware and operating systems. For example, I had to get a refund because it was not optimized for my widescreen display and it would constantly think my Windows 10 os was WIndows 8 and ask me if it could change some permissions in order to run properly.

76561198030524112,Recommended,217200,31183450,Posted: 16 April,all,nevs temen,This is oghhh and ughhh and just the best Worms game to ever come out and there will be no better worm game ever. There are tons of similar games but this is ooohhh so perfect. If you are 10 years old you will love it if you are 10010 also. Brilliant part is that you can name your worms and teams. There is a lot of strategy in a game but skill is also important. I can hardly think of a game that goes better with pizza. It is the game I will be ready to play when ever someone ask me to. I m not fun of Single-player on this one even it is god that way also.  Better than the worms in reality! :)
,Recommended,217200,31158961,Posted: 15 April,all,damn_vegetables,"Of the Worms games I've played (Worms, 2, World Party, 3D, Reloaded) this one is my favourite. I've heard good things about WMD and I'm considering getting it, though my wishlist is really long. Ehh, I'll get to it eventually I'm sure. Anyways, back to this game. It manages to get the physics and feel for controls just right so that it's challenging to play without being obscenely difficult. The missions have a good progression and it's always good to play some random matches. Plus being able to get custom voice packs from fan sites is great."

76561198082660436,Recommended,217200,29409721,Posted: 21 January,all,hernang.ortiz,"Cartoony style game with 'cute' worms violently fighting each other and spouting militant rhetoric in many different language choices. Very easy to pick up but difficult to master, resulting in a lot of replayability for such a casual looking game. Also worth noting is an AI that is very well designed and can provide a fair amount of fun as well.   However, this is more of a 'party game' or at least 'duel game' that really brings up your competitive spirit and help you bond with your opponent. Recommended for couples, families, and/or anyone who frequently bring people over. A great bonus is allowing user to modify weapon statistics/ammo as well as gameplay rules - much needed because many of these settings are horribly unbalanced and lower the fun if unchanged. Easy 5/5"
,Recommended,217200,29364169,Posted: 19 January,all,Pandadump,"This is an old-school classic, I had this on the N64 -- one of my all time favs. There is a ton of fun to have as a newcomer, plenty of single-player and multi-player laughs to be had. There is also a deep-rooted community that still plays online today, on a competitive level, and in different ways. There are rope-swing pros, tunnel-fighting pros, classic style pros, shotgun/pachinko pros, and the list goes on.I would say this is the definitive worms title, definitely worth checking out even in 2017, anything newer seems like fluff to me (though I still like the newer titles for the most part too)."
