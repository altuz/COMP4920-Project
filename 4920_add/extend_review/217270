,Recommended,217270,9163142,"Posted: 17 February, 2014",all,Sysgen,"From the creator of Prince of Persia, a fighter remade from early days of computing, 1984. Objective is to rescue the princess held captive by the evil warlord. You get three fighters though the ultimate objective is to not have to use numbers 2 and 3. The first fighter is weak and that's where the challenge lies. Upon his failure he is replaced by a stronger fighter. Upon his death he is replaced by an even stronger fighter. The princess is happy to be freed but wants her true love, fighter 1 to rescue her.Unlike the 1984 version this version is based almost solely on counters. By listening carefully to the musical score you can discern the number of attacks to which you must block. After successfully blocking the last attack you can counter, damaging the opponent and whittling away his health. There is a chi system that allows you to stun your opponent as well as a health recovery system after some but not all fights.The game itself is quite short but the path to freeing the princess is challenging and the ambiance of feudal Japan is immersive. The game is also available on the IPhone but does support 1080P and controllers on the PC."

It was fun and so when I saw the reboot I was intrigued.  I bought it in the Summer sale (2015) and finally got around to playing it.  It is very short, but has some replay value trying to do it without being hit and winning with the true love.Buy it on sale for $2-3 and you will enjoy it.6/10"

,Recommended,217270,31703449,Posted: 12 May,all,PasterOfMuppets,"I got this one remembering the Apple II version from waaaay back in grade school, what I got was a pleasant surprise. I like the addition of 3 characters with different attributes, however you cant select what one you want to start with. After you die with one, it sends another, starting with the Fighter (I guess they call him The True Love) (balanced), then the Monk (quick as hell) and finally the Brute (the overgrown powerhouse). Fun but feels cheap at times, your block timing has to be dead on balls, pinpoint accurate or youre taking damage, especially when fighting Akuma, no matter what your timing is, it seems you will not block a majority of his attacks, other than that, I would recomend this one 7/10"

The gameplay is over-simplified and boring. There really isn't much to do besides run to your next opponent, block a move and make one yourself. Even the inclusion of three playable characters and a pleasant art style can't rescue Karateka from the bottom of the barrel."

I belong to the second group.This game  is a tribute to the old Karateka game and it really shows.  The game  has a really  short length  and no voice acting.  It wants  you  to  finish the game in one playthrough, you can  keep resuming  the game  until you succed in beating akuma.My biggest gripe is the fighting mechanism is rhythm based.  on one hand this separates Karateka  from other fighting games, on the other hand ithis makes the game really boring because  you can only hit your opponent after blocking his last attack.Despite some blocky parts like leaves and mariko's hair, the characters and levels designs are amazing.  The palace garden is very beautiful"

Karateka is one of those cases.The game is simple and it does what promises very well. The art style reminds me of that cartoon look of torchlight or age of empires online. The experience of using the music sounds as a warning for you to quickly react to enemy's attacks is really fun. I Recommend the use of Xbox360 control. At the beginning I thought that the fact that you can only move forward to be a little strange and annoying but, once you understand the point of the game it really doesn't make any difference. There is no point on going back. I've played it a few times after getting to the end to see if I could beat the game without losing any life. When you die you come back to the game as a different character that is less desirable by the princess that you are attempting to safe. This makes you wanting to get to the end of the game without losing any life even more. I've been playing games like FTL and the: (if you die its over thing) really works for some games (specially this one). It forces you to achieve a higher level of skill in order to beat it. Just have yourself a healthy meal before playing this game. You will need to be extra focus to make no mistake. Really fun game."

It's certainly not going to set the world on fire, but it's a lovely take on a format that's been dead for years, freshened up just enough to be more accessible while remaining quite hardcore at heart. It's a humble little thing, but it works quite nicely."

,Recommended,217270,811564,"Posted: 15 December, 2012",all,mark | dj.,"Karateka is a pretty straightforward game, literally. You move one of three characters forward while fighting off guards and bosses. The fights are rhythm based and give you an indication of when to block and when to attack. It's a fun idea, unless you want to listen to some background music of course. You start off with the True Love. The idea is to finish the game with this character in order to get the true ending. If this character is defeated in battle, he'll be replaced by a new characters which also gives you a different ending. It's unlikely you'll finish your first game with the first character, because the battles increase in difficulty near the middle of the game, which is about 15 minutes in. That's right. The game only lasts 30 minutes per session.The graphics are cartoony and look pretty good in motion. The movies, however, look, and probably are, compressed. The sounds are nothing to write home about, but they get the job done.Would I recommend it ? In a way, yes, because the character idea is fresh and it's fun while it lasts. But the current price is just to steep if you ask me, especially for a game this short (even though it requires multiple playthroughs). Wait for a pricedrop; then get it.[Rating: 77/100]"

My memories of the original version from Broderbund, at a time when the Apple II was the cutting edge of personal computing technology, are hazy at best. I remember it not looking even as sophisticated as some of the beat-'em-ups of the day like Bruce Lee or Kung Fu Master, but I remember virtually nothing about the gameplay. The new Kareteka utilizes a peculiar, rhythm-based combat scheme that is easy to learn and difficult to--well, it's just difficult.You play as one of three would-be rescuers attempting to save your beloved Mariko from the ""evil warlord Akuma."" You move through several environments doing battle with Akuma's minions with the ultimate goal of reaching his palace and the final battle. Mind you, you're not choosing which protagonist to play the game with; you start with Mariko's true love. If his health pool drops to zero, he falls to his death, and the monk takes his place. Should the monk perish, the brute takes his place. Finally, if the brute is beaten down, you have the option to continue, losing a certain percentage of your score in the process. Each successive hero has a larger health pool and stronger attacks. When grappling with a new opponent, your objective is to counter each punch or kick in a sequence by pressing the ""block"" button at just the right time. Even if you miss one or two and get hit, as long as you block the antagonist's last attack in that sequence, you are given the opportunity to launch a flurry of your own blows. After a series of 3-4 attacks, your opponent will become invincible again until you block another sequence of attacks. This dance continues until one of you is defeated. There are also purple flowers that you will encounter along the way that will partially or fully restore your health pool. Opponents gradually increase in difficulty by varying their attack patterns.It sounds clever and fun on paper but in practice, the controls (even with an XBOX 360 controller) are wonky and your blocks don't always appear to register correctly. Even though you can easily run through the roster of opponents in less than an hour, I suspect even the most gifted Guitar Hero player will find himself unable to succeed in completing the game with Mariko's true love. The artwork looks good and the music is thematically-appropriate, but the gameplay itself leaves something to be desired. Kareteka makes for a brief but rather frustrating distraction from more complex games."

However, if you grew up playing Prince of Persia on MSDOS, you are going to appreciate this game.This game is all about paying attention to the musical notes and timing your blocks.

This time around, the game focuses on rhythm as its means of combat, forcing you to pay attention to when enemies are about to strike. One round takes about 30 minutes to do, more or less. The game has some beautiful visuals that will evoke memories for cel shade fans; its art style is very similar to Wind Waker, for example. The PC port of this game does have some bugs, though. My game can only be played windowed, and even though I can stretch that window out all the way, it doesn't constraint my cursor.

Maybe not too much to write home about but I really like it. Just got it last night (Feb. 20th 2015) and didn't play it till today (21st).  Before playing I read all the bad reviews and thought I stumbled on a failure, but it was actually the good old fashion hate-behind-the-fanboyism... and yes there is a major fanboyism (I'm part of) that is dedicated to the classic 8-bit Karateka computer version from the 80's.So after reading I thought I bought another lemon, but now I'm pretty much addicted to this version. In all honesty I would have done things differently if I was the main developer, however I'm still very pleased with this game. There needs to be an upgrade to the KEY BINDINGS for crying out loud.This remake, does need a remake though. I do find it much easier then the orginal but still fun.
