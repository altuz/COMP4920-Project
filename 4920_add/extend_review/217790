,Recommended,217790,33525853,Posted: 13 July,all,julie0555,"A lot of people reviewing this game have been under the impression that this is (or is supposed to be) a flight sim game. This is NOT a sim of any kind. This is more of an arcade style dogfighting game. This game is simple, straightforward, and fun if you just want to shoot planes out of the sky. There is no joystick support (in fact the settings and options for this game are very limited) and there is no multiplayer. There is however local co-op. The mission objectives are straightforward and not repetitive. There are some options for customizing your plane (adding numbers on the wings, shark face to the nose of the plane, etc). You do get to fly various planes of the era (American, British, Russian, and German) which is awesome of course. (My personal favorite were the Russian planes in the Russia Under Seige DLC. While slower, they have the most firepower.) I would recommend playing this with the DLC, which should give you about 5-6 hours total of playtime. I bought the game complete with DLC on sale for $1.71. Can't beat that.Recommended if you like arcade style flight combat."

,Recommended,217790,33841416,Posted: 27 July,all,lordholnapult,"Dogfight 1942 is a good game.I've already played others titles like this and I appreciate the arcade genre, because also this dogfight is an arcade.You will have 2 main campaigns in the base game, so I suggest to buy all the bundle in order to play the entire experience.Missions are fast to be completed, and introductions with teammates speaking and cinematic view of the airplanes are a good part of the game. The game itself is instead a little poor: you fly and shoot using machinegun or missiles or bombs, and sometimes torpedoes, but enemy really fall in a few hit and the dogfights that the title suggests are really fast to be terminated.Event the ace from enemy troops are easy to take down. Instead I've found better combats in Air Conflicts.The controls are a bit peculiar: you don't manouver the airplane directly, but the machine gun targeting. So if you follow enemies on screen, your airplane follow the target, rotating and cutting the corners.Instead I prefer Air Conflict where you move the airplane and if the target is around the enemy automatically it him; this is more challenging than here in dogfight.The engine is good for a visual impact, if you don't want too much. The only problem is the drop of framerate inside concitated fights... but the scenario is not so complicated, so why this happens?In any case the game is perfect in bundle with special offers. It grants a good variety of missions and can be terminated in a couple of days. You can always try the random dogfights mode or try with highest difficulty.In any case not bad.Lord Hol Napult's exp: 7-/10"

Where do I start with the positives of this WELL not regrettable purchase from Steam. Full of fast and furiously paced arcade and 'casual' control mode action right from the word go things just get better as the player progresses through the game. There is also a 'simulation' control mode which I have yet to try out. But considering the lack of a cockpit (at all times during gameplay the view of the aircraft is external and from behind) I reckon the first two control modes will be the best ones to use. There is a multitude of aircraft available to fly and in selectable alternative colour schemes too. On the Allies side these begin with 'Woodland' or Green / Grey camouflage, Desert colours, 'Sea' or navy-type colours and finally there is an 'ace' colour scheme. The same type and breadth of selection is also available for Axis side aircraft.There is only one down-side: No Joystick usage! The options being available are Keyboard, Keyboard and Mouse (which I use) and XBox 360 control pad. Bearing in mind the 'arcadiness' of the game I selected Keyboard and Mouse mode having always been an avid Joystick user. This is something I am quickly becoming accustomed with. But given the overall quality of this game and the two DLC Add-On Packages available for it on Steam this controller-related whinge is indeed a short one.

Actually I left the game for a while and managed to crash twice before taking off from the carrier in the Midway mission, and I had the controlls set on arcade mode, so I suppose that it's not overly simple that way, but the missions and objectives are more simple (get in there, hit the carriers with torpedoes and get out) . The local competitve and co-op play was a big selling plus for me . It has good war game effects - I would recommend turning your headphones down to about 30 percent when first jumping into the game for solo action - the engines and machine guns sound real good .

76561198017056364,Recommended,217790,35168402,Posted: 23 September,all,CodeTiger,"This is a good game. I like the way the controls work and there is an option to play in arcade mode or simulation. I like the way they did the simulation controls. You can do tactics like a full barrel roll to get into position behind the enemy plane or create distance where you can get a better angle for leading fire, or half a roll and pull up which will cause you to do a high g turn towards the ground. Really good defense strategy when there is a plane on your 6.   In fact the best turning is done when you are pulling up on the stick. So you roll the plane so that you are always pulling up to turn, will give you the tightest turning.The other thing I like is that the planes feel different. So if you have a jet on you and you have a slower plane you have the turning advantage and the jet has it speed, the jet can climb faster, steeper and higher without stalling. You can uses this in your strategy when dog fighting. A jet will find it hard to get on the inside because its speed will cause it to overshoot, where as in a jet you need to create distance and slow the jet down so the nose can get on the inside. If you overuse ace mode then you will never need to think about tactics, but it does not mean it isn't there.The game allows you to make it easy or difficult. As I play I try to use the ace mode less and less, only once I have the enemy plane in my sites, which can lead to some cool flowing combat where you feel that there was some skill involved. The xbox one controller worked for me. I am still working towards not using ace mode at all and still perform quick kills, but the AI knows how to do high g turn to make it difficult to light them up, or climb when you are chasing to cause you to stall and then swoop down to finish you off or shake you.I want more airplane games to adopt this control system as it feels natural and allows you to enjoy the game while learning to fly the planes better and learn the concepts of dog fighting.Playing with a friend in co-op is really a lot of fun.My only complaint is that it is to short even with the dlc's.  Also a better damage system where a few well placed shots in the fuel tank will cause a fire ball, or shooting the pilot will cause the plane to fall or spiral to the ground. Seeing pilots ejecting would have been cool. Would you be honorable and allow them to fight another day or would you take them out?Some sort of air force ranking system would have been cool to. Who doesn't like shinny medals and to go up in rank. The more you use ace mode the slower your rank meter goes up.Slap on an rpg system and it would be my dream game. But I digress in the hopes that there is a developer that gets it.This game has definitely kindled my enjoyment of dog fighting games."

,Not Recommended,217790,35126953,Posted: 22 September,all,wildsaf,"Not a great experience.1. Framerate issues! :(  Even with good hardware and the lowest graphical settings the choppiness when turning, when enemies come into view and when something explodes is horribly distracting. The screen actually flickers which makes for real headaches. What is worse is when little windows pop up with instructions and controls. It just makes the game near unplayable. After first install this is one of the few games that asks to restart the system. Appears to be poorly optimised.2. Doesn't have full controller support and the arcade controls feel really chunky and dicky and it just doesn't look or handle anything like the promotional videos imply.3. Just not polished at all. The epic music is good, but feels generic and the graphics have a really dated Sega Dreamcast kind of style with poor quality textures and models up close.4. Needs a much better way of identifying enemies to prevent unnecessary friendly fire. At the moment it is more or less trial and error.Overall, the game is just not enjoyable. Local co-op has promise, but it shares and the problems above. I know it is arcade, but all the same it just feels far too linear, scripted, on rails and repetitive. Got this game on special but still feel a little ripped. It's really not what it is cut out to be."
