,Not Recommended,218040,28698834,"Posted: 26 December, 2016",all,Draconiss,"Let me start out by saying that I have a degree focusing on Political Science and have worked in the sector....The Socioeconomic policies do not reflect what happens in the real world, more what someone idealizes how they should work. The Human Element is not well represented, such as in situations where a positive outcome is seen, but the electorate is unhappy due to outlying political/social/etc beliefs (e.g. the goal is accomplished, but not HOW the populace wanted it accomplished, etc).The Political system is rather simplified and this makes a Democratic Socialist approach far too easy and ignores key psychological responses that have been observed in the real world when certain situations arise.After playing for a few hours, using demographic knowledge of game developers, and knowing the political beliefs behind certain policies, I easily beat the game with a Social Democracy....which appears to be the ultimate point of the developers. Comparatively, I attempted a few other forms of government approaches that have been historically stable in the real world, but those forms were not nearly as friendly in the game world.As this is intended to be a political sim attempting to replicate the real world, I cannot recommend this.However, if this were a model that honestly stated its intent to show HOW a Democratic Socialist contruct can best be made and why it is best for them, in their view, as compared to other options...Then I would say that it accomplished its intent."

,Recommended,218040,7888098,"Posted: 2 December, 2013",all,Tepig V,"Definitely a great game, but you have to fit the right niche. No flashy graphics to distract you, just a screen and some government policy options. It's pretty fun to try to build different types of countries, such as a socialist one or a pure capitalist democracy, or even try to model it after the style of leadership of an individual. It's your chance to create a country the way you see fit, so why not take it!"

What's the point in that? I was actually looking forward to being opposition leader and laying the smackdown on the current government while I set my party on a road to recovery.It just made it a really one-dimensional and short-lived game for me."

,Not Recommended,218040,27883712,"Posted: 27 November, 2016",all,madhi123,"This is a very simple and minimalistic government simulator type game. After playing about thrice, you learn all the mechanics inside out, and it becomes boringly easy to ""win"". It has a very linear type of policy making panel, with far left, or far right, and everything in between. Everything has a linear and predictable effect, and all-in-all, it becomes very tedious.It is fun for the first few hours however, I won't deny that. But it simply has no replayability. Games like Masters of the World have a much better and in-depth mechanic and policy implementation. But if that's too complicated for you, then this game is just fine. Grab it on sale since this is an old game, no point paying full price like I did for a game that's just about mediocre.Overall Rating: 6/10"

Only complaint I can think of is that it encourages you to go to extremes on all the issues and doesn't really encourage moderation (basically, if you're going to anger a certain part of the electorate anyway, then the game doesn't discourage you from going all the way).I've also heard some complaints that this game has a left-wing bias but I don't buy that. You'll get some bad events if you go full-blown socialist to the point of alienating your capitalists."

This is a game that is over 4 years old now, and still costs 20 dollars. It's ridiculous! Second, many of the in-game options are unbalanced. I have been assassinated, by environmentalists, when I had a carbon tax and strong anti-pollution regulations. Most importantly, I find, the amount of actual changes you can make besides different degrees of neoliberal capitalism is very low. You can't have any kind of socialism(Social democracy is very attainable, but the closest thing to a leftist ideology in the game, and it's still capitalist.), you can't abolish the government, and limited government doesn't work great either. You can't really have fascism either.Even the sequel to this game(Democracy 3) is still plagued by many of these problems, but slighty less so. If you really want a game like this, just skip this one and get Democracy 3, but the entire series isn't the best, I find. There isn't a really high amount of replayability, either, it all gets to be the same pattern, for me. (Make some changes, keep budget balanced, some terrorist group gets angry, I get assassinated after about an hour of playing)Can't recommend."

If you♥♥♥♥♥♥off the voters, they'll punish you at once.A lot of what you can do has inertia effects, and may take up to two years to come to full effect. Most tax-fiddeling will be instantaneous though.Your cabinet gains (or loses) political power, which is what you use to pass laws.If the public are dissatisfied you lose some, and if they're happy you gain some.And without it, it's very limited what you can change or do.Theres 10 different countries to play, and they all have different voters and problems.If you're into modding and know a little programming, you can make your own countries, laws, events; and even choose your own voter behavior.You win the game if you manage to stay in office the full number of periods you've chosen to play (1-10), and you lose by not getting re-elected or by reaching the maximun allowed debt (differs according to country).It's not worth the full 20€ they want for it, but at 4.75 it's a pretty fun little game."

I guess Americans just can't imagine that not being an issue anywhere. Oh, and patriots are always in favour of reduced gun control, because that's how it works in America.
