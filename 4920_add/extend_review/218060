It has you playing as CommanderVideo, jumping, blocking and springjumping his way across 5 different worlds to escape back to his crew.The game expands wonderfully on the original, with different playable characters, costumes, challenges, bonuses, dance combos, the lot. It looks better, it controls better and it feels better.Nor does the game ramp up towards the end arbitrarily, but instead puts difficulty into the game thematically.Really super fun, completed each level on hardest difficulty within 7 hours. Check this game out!Nilesy"

I know Runner 1 had that 2D retro thing it was rocking but this honestly looks so much better. And it still has 2D retro stages so those sort of make up for it. Oh, and more importantly you can access them from the map screen this time so no having to replay the level perfectly on one life ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t anymore too.Actual replayability this time. Branching paths. Unlockable (strange) characters. 3 difficulty levels.CHECKPOINTS. IF YOU HAVEN'T PLAYED THE FIRST THEN YOU WON'T UNDERSTAND HOW GLORIOUS OF AN IMPROVEMENT THEIR INCLUSION IS. IF YOU TRIED THE FIRST ONE AND HATED IT YOU PROBABLY QUIT ON ODYSSEY. I KNOW. Hell, the option to skip them for extra points is great too.Still frustrating as hell because your eyes tend to blur things after a certain point and there's still somewhat of an element of trial and error memorization or clutch reflex things you need to pull off. But this time it isn't enough to turn me off from this game.I probably missed stuff but yeah, worth a pick up. Runner 1 is okay but there is a clear drop-off point at the end of the first world because they took everything that ruined the game and shoved it all into the longest level in the game."

,Recommended,218060,16313674,"Posted: 11 June, 2015",all,AncientPancakes,"This game isn't some average day Banquet TV Dinner, let me tell you. Bit Trip Runner 2 is, actually, a very simplistic side-scrolling platformer with some slick rhythm elements and a very unique, whimsical style.You play as Commander Video and your task is to reach the end of some levels, DOMINATE your robotic nemesis, and save your friends.  The first level starts off pretty chill, just jumpin' over some lil' bumps in the road, look out for some robots. Not a big deal. Everything is going great until you see- OH MY GOODNESS-  an airborne robot threat! You can't jump over him, so you're forced to hit down and SLIDE underneath it. You might be thinking ""Dang, now I gotta jump over things AND slide under things too, this is getting a little outta control"".Fortunately, things only get crazier as new mechanics and abilites are introduced. Over time you'll be hoppin' on springs, grinding on rails like a skater dude, karate kicking through your enemies, deflecting power cubes with your force field barrier, and dancing 24/7. Trust me, its too sick. The game offers 3 different difficulties, but the overall challenge is pretty tame. Fans of the 1st Bit Trip Runner may be disappointed at the drop in difficulty.One of my favorite aspects of the game is it's musical magnificence. Not only is the soundtrack itself killer, but the ways in which sound is integrated into the platforming is a real juicy treat.  As you progress in a level the soundtrack will increase in complexity, and every single action that you perform in the level, like completing a jump or hitting a spring, will make sounds that add to the beat.  It's little things like this that make Runner 2 stand out and make me say ""I LIKE THIS GAME.""There's plenty of costumes and characters to unlock, and 100+ levels to complete. If you go for 100% completion, this game can occupy you for quite some time. I must say that, for me, it was truly a slamtastic experience. So, If you are thinking of purchasing this, I'd recommend looking at some videos of the game in action so you know what to expect, but rest assured that you will be buying excellence.To sum it up, if Bit Trip Runner 2 was a wild animal, it would definitely be a funky lookin' rainforest ape.Thank you for reading this review."

Once the beat kicks in and you're on a roll on hard mode there is something magical about the music it creates. Graphics look brilliant unlike the first game, further proving that indie developers need to stop it with the lazy retro art styles. Characters can now dance meaning you can risk doing so in stages for points adding a great competitive element if you are into leaderboards but there is more than enough challenge and replayability to be found anyway."

It's less difficult than its predecessor even on the hardest difficulty, thanks in part to the implementation of mid-level checkpoints. (You can skip them if you want even more challenge and a points bonus.)At a glance you would think this is one of those ""infinite runners"" but (for better or worse) this is not the case. It has 100 levels, 5 bosses, and 25 hidden ""retro"" levels, with individual leaderboards and at the beginning of each level you get a quick glance at how your friends did on that level.And Charles Martinet always brings a smile to my face.

The smoother difficulty curve makes it accessible or nice to everybody  and this is great if you're a newbie. However, it just takes a while to master the moves so you should play in hard difficulty to avoid boredom. This is how a true alien runs: play rather hard; never use check-points; triple perfect+ on every stage! Of course, artwork and music is awesome.

,Recommended,218060,23175419,"Posted: 23 May, 2016",all,StakAttak,"After 26 hours of playtime, unlocking everything, collecting everything, and getting every achievement I think I'm finally ready to review Bit.Trip Runner 2: Future Legend of Rhythm Alien.When I played this game for the first time, it evoked the same feelings I experienced playing games like Super Mario World, Crash Bandicoot, and Tetris for the first time. You sit there, not realizing that you're smiling and moving to the music and even humming along, and then it hits you; you're a kid again, and there's not a care in the world. It's almost magical. It's also everything a sequel could hope to be in every category, and it's become one of my favorite games on Steam. I could go on and on with statements like these (and they would all be true) but all you really need to know is if the game is fun or not, and the answer to that is absolutely, joyously, colorfully YES.This game is not only a loveletter to fans of the original game (on which it improves on everything fans asked and hoped for and then some) but also to anyone who is a fan of stylish, musically driven platformers or rhythm games. The world is vibrant, hilarious and creative with giant, cartoonish backgrounds that will sometimes even distract you from the game with how funny and imaginative the situations are. This goes without saying but the music, a major boon and pivotal component of the gameplay, is completely stellar. Each world has a new song and you'll want to collect all of the music pickups as soon as you can to add more and more layers to the beat. The levels are laid out in such a way that each jump, kick, bounce and deflection adds a complementary tune to the soundtrack, and it makes you feel like the songs are not just background audio but a real part of the experience. The gameplay has been reworked and is far more about actual skill, timing and reflexes than the original Bit.Trip Runner's reliance on memorization and punishment through repetition. The moves are simple; you can duck, kick, jump, and block. Simple, right? It's the way Gaijin Games combines these basic manuevers in the levels that give you a real challenge that never feels cheap or frustrating so that when you lose, you know why and you're raring for another shot. You know how to duck and you know how to jump, but what happens when you're faced with a grounded and floating pair of enemies with space in between? You duck and jump at the same time, of course! A floating enemy with a wall underneath? You kick while sliding! In this way every new challenge feels organic and satisfying because you are mixing these moves that you've mastered to navigate these mazes of music that the developers have created for you. Soon you're flying through the air, blocking cubes, shattering floating enemies, jumping and sliding at a pace that will make onlookers think you must have been playing this game for years.There's 5 worlds complete with bonus stages and hidden retro courses, unlockable characters and costumes, three difficulties (and optional checkpoints, THANK GOD), leaderboards, challenges and achievements, so you'll be playing this game for quite a while if you want to see everything it has to offer. At the price this game goes for now on sale, it's really a no brainer. Pick it up, pick up the soundtrack, maybe even grab a copy for your friend. Yes, it's that good. Happy running!"

,Recommended,218060,9047776,"Posted: 10 February, 2014",all,Spaceman Atlas,"BIT.TRIP Runner 2 (forgive me, but I'm not using the full name of the game) is a really fun... platformer? It's not really a platformer, more like a crash course of obstacles to avoid. Which might sound boring, but it's actually pretty fun!The gameplay is relaxing, yet challenging; there hasn't been anything that made me ragequit, just try harder; the normal difficulty setting seems to be really balanced, and also implementing checkpoints makes the frustration factor go waaaay down. One note though, if you don't have a controller, you might have a bad time.There is a lot to do here. 100 levels, with collectibles, chests, keys and other stuff. You can go for all the items, try the high score or try the deceptively tough warp zones (3 lives...) If you're a stickler for collecting, prepare to get sucked in.Visuals are top-notch, the art style is really pleasing and in a sense idyllic. And of course, the most important factor in such a game, is the sound; I cannot praise the sound enough. The combination of your inputs and the visuals and the music, wonderfully composed of variously pitched sounds, make this game feel really complete and suck you in.All of this makes this one of the ""one more level"" genre games. And sure, it won't last you forever, as there is an end to all the challenges, but I'll be damned if you don't have lots of fun on the way there.Strongly recommend. Pick this up now, or on the nearest sale (it was really cheap in December, but I never got around to playing it)"

The introduction of checkpoints in the middle of the level (and optional at that) is a great idea that made the game more accessible to people who complained about the first game's lack of difficulty.

If you enjoy running style games ala Runner 1, Jetpack Joyride, or Temple Run, this game is by far the best of that series....AND NO MICROTRANSACTIONS!"

Even tried binding the buttons to keyboard presses using the Logitech profiler software, but those petty tricks is no match for this game's stubbornness.Anywho, onward and upwards with my trusty wired gaming keyboard. This proved less than optimal, as there's a really noticable input lag. I know it's part of the game design that you remember the pattern of the obstacles anyways, meaning that you should be able to simply adjust the timing of memorized keypresses. But under normal circumstances good reflexes can make up for what you forget - so NOT being able to do so in the very last stages of the game ups the difficulty A LOT.Lower the difficulty to grandma mode you say? NEVAH!The first 85% of the game is mostly smooth and enjoyable sailing, but the last parts had me yelling at the monitor. It didn't seem to mind though.If it weren't for the aforementioned technical problems, I'd give this charming rythmic platformer a respectable 80%, but I can't justify more than 65%."

,Recommended,218060,811565,"Posted: 8 March, 2013",all,mark | dj.,"Runner 2 is the follow-up to the first Bit.Trip Runner game. I think it's best described as a rhythm/melody game on rails.  Your character will automatically run and it's up to you to jump, slide, kick, dance, block (et cetera) your way to the finish line while collecting as much gold as you can (which can be used to open up new levels).The game will create sounds based on your actions and it's very satisfying to hear a song in its entire glory. You're allowed to miss a beat, but if you hit an object you'll be taken back to the beginning or the last checkpoint.Bit.Trip Runner 2 improves on almost every aspect of the previous game; the graphics are now 3D, there are many more moves, multiple ways to finish a level, a bit of a story, items/unlockables to collect and it even looks like it's more accessible (ie, easier; this might not please everyone however).If you enjoyed the first one, this one is a must have.[Rating: 83/100]"

I was on Quite Easy though. But the main thrill comes from Rather Hard and I really enjoy it. Also, I especially love the theme and style of the game.

If you did not like BTR1 for difficulty reasons, maybe you'll like this! Levels have checkpoints now, but on the other hand, you've also got to do a lot more precision movement as the game goes on*, so... kinda wipes out the assistance the former gives you after a certain point.Overall this is a good game! Again, if you played its predecessor, you know what you're getting into here. The problem is that it's a huge friggin' mess design-wise. If you're into challenging platforming, that's still here, it's true, but sometimes hitboxes are really unclear (and this is twice as bad with the DLC characters). If you were the sort of OCD completionist who loved the prior game's ""perfect"" scores, guess what: you now have 3x the content. The game ranks you on if you perfect EACH DIFFICULTY LEVEL. Irritated by buying the prior one later and finding the high score table locked up by perfect scores forever? Well guess what - this time you now have to spam a key to get the best scores while you're challenging the stage.In fact, a huge amount of the problems I have with this game come down to ""mash this button now!!!"" or oddly-timed QTEs in the middle of what's generally a platformer**. If you miss an item, you see the item and you know where you screwed up. If you miss a button-press you don't get ""too fast/too slow"", and suddenly it's rage-inducing because YOU PRESSED THE KEY FOR CRYING OUT LOUD. The others are basically ""learn the level or go screw"" design - not only do some stages have multiple exits (kindly marked, however), a couple branch in multiple ways before converging at the end... and not always in ways that let each path get perfect scores. Having to replay a stage over and over just to HUNT for gold in an auto-scrolling game sucks. Having to replay a stage because you need to beat a level to go back and take a specific path in a prior level if you want to unlock a costume or character sucks***.Again: this game is a mess, design-wise, but it's not a BAD game. Just... well, the kind of bitter pill pretty much every Bit.Trip game was, where it was JUST close enough to being excellent to make the flaws more jagged.* It is entirely possible some of the ""harder"" moves aren't present on lower difficulty levels. (There are three: easy/normal/hard). I would not know about this, I've been going through on Hard.** I am told that if you're not playing this on a keyboard, you have to spin joysticks in time with an obstacle instead on some of these. I don't know which seems more miserable.*** This is not a joke. Every world has some items/paths locked behind keys, which only appear after you effectively finish a world and take a specific path to open ""the Key Vault"". Sometimes they will be locked behind ""must have X/Y gold in this world to progress"" gates, too! It's like a Rare collectathon in the middle of a pure platformer."

The game looks and sounds much better, and Runner2's gameplay seems more forgiving than its predecessor. Levels now have checkpoints, which could be entirely avoided if one so desires. The bonus retro levels, once found, can be completed without having to go thru the main level again. And the difficulty isn't quiet as intense as in RUNNER although it still offers 3 difficulty settings. One of which being ""Rather Hard"" which could still be challenging to any RUNNER veteran.Throughout some levels are hidden things like the Retro levels, additional characters, and keys & chests that unlock costumes. Those and aiming for Perfect+ in each of the 3 difficulties will have you replaying levels over and over again, easily spending much more time on this game than RUNNER.Runner2 comes definitely recommended, more so than RUNNER."

,Recommended,218060,11408160,"Posted: 25 July, 2014",all,viad,"Bit.Trip Runner 2 is the sequel to the original Bit.Trip Runner game, with lots of changes to bring another fantastic game. Since this game is a directly numbered sequel, there are some similarities between the two games. One thing to note is the series's trademark pixelized art style is changed to a more stylized and cartoony look. Overall, the worlds are less brightly colored and flashy but still are trippy or weird in nature. The music is also not chiptune in nature, but still has the style of Bit.Trip to it. Some songs wil be familiar to those who played prior games like Runner, and the music is still electronica based. Most fans of the original Bit.Trip games might bemoan these changes, but they actually are a refreshing change and still carry the same kind of charm and style that makes this a Bit.Trip game. The story continues from the ending of Runner, with all of Commander Video's friends and Mingrawn Timbletot being in the cutscenes. However, Commander Video is sent into an alternate dimension and chases after Mingrawn Timbletot in this more cartoony dimension.The gameplay naturally takes after Bit.Trip Runner. Players keep running and must dodge obstacles using several abilities. Runner 2 adds new objects in the levels to mix things up, such as a loop the loop, speed boosts, and rails. Additionally, the player has a few more abilities to use to navigate new obstacles. Included in every level are checkpoints that players will restart at if they hit an obstacle after that checkpoint. The checkpoint may be skipped to earn bonus points, but at the expense of starting from the beginning of the level if they mess up. Alternate paths are showcased more in the game, and even have signs showing which paths are easier or harder. The harder paths tend to give more points, but may also have a treasure chest to unlock costumes or even unlock a new level with an alternate exit. Some levels also have keys which must be activated first from a Key Vault level. The levels with keys then are to be replayed to unlock a padlock and get another treasure chest. The difficulty tends to be easier than Runner on the Just Right difficulty thanks to the checkpoints making levels more bearable and the difficulty curve not being too extreme like in the first game. Runner 2's Hard mode should give a challenging set of levels with a difficulty not unlike the previous Runner game. There are more levels overall in Runner 2, which should make this game longer than the 5 hours of gameplay expected in the first Runner game.Bit.Trip Runner 2 might look a bit different in style to other Bit.Trip games, but this game is just as fun as the first Runner game. Runner 2 boasts more features in the gameplay and is a longer experience while having the signature Bit.Trip style to the game. With a fun cartoony style and a variety of levels with good music, different level designs, and more fair difficulty, Runner 2 is sure to be a great experience that gives challenges and different things to be expecting."

While the previous Runner suffered from monotonously long levels and strict inputs, this game not only improves mechanically and graphically but expands enough to breathe. Multiple paths loaded with secrets are facilitated by the addition of midlevel checkpoints -- and don't worry, hardcore gamers, you can always skip the checkpoint for score if you're feeling daring. Scoring is part showmanship, part white-knuckled risk-reward... with just a pinch of playful absurdism right at the end. Like everything else in this game, it's tongue-in-cheek but surprisingly clever."

That being said, the music is fun, it's cool to have somewhat of a story, and the world is visually interesting.The timing between issuing a command and having the character respond was incredibly hard for me to get down. I had another friend play a few levels and he had trouble with it, too, although he picked it up much faster than I did. Thus, the weird lag has made this game very difficult and frustrating for me. It's nice that each level has checkpoints, but when your character gets sent back to the checkpoint or replays the level after failing, there's a whole little dance+music thing, and it quickly gets annoying after you've tripped over an obstacle 5 times in a row.If you are skilled at these kinds of games and just want to play a quick round of a game, enjoy some music, and watch a fun environment, this is for you.

,Recommended,218060,30346082,Posted: 5 March,all,Nuts,"""BIT.TRIP Presents... Runner2: Future Legend of Rhythm Alien"" is probably the most ridiculous name I have seen for game. Why did they feel like they needed to make this the name? I get that you want to get the company known, and I guess it has worked because I refer to the game as ""Bit trip Runner"" instead of ""Runner2"", but it is a pretty dumb title.Anyway, this game is a lot of fun. The gameplay is pretty simple and slowly introduces you to new features and obstacles that make the game more interesting and challenging. The boss battles are done quite interestingly and don’t completely change the games mechanics just to incorporate bosses. They just test all the skills you have learnt from playing through the levels.The music, luckily, does not get annoying seeing as you end up listening to it lots of times after dying repeatedly. It’s quite catchy and once you get into the rhythm, you can time jumps and dodges to fly through the level. The music changing depending on the area you are in is good as well. The Reggae inspired beats that are used in the second stage are pretty good and the timing is a bit off to try and throw you off and make the game a bit more of a challenge.The costumes are quite fun to mess about with. There are some funny ones and some that are straight up gross. The Retro levels are fun and can be quite challenging, especially seeing as you only get a certain number of lives before you need to restart and unlock them again.There is one thing that has♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off though. It’s not a big deal really but as someone who likes to get achievements and 100% games, it has put a bit of a sour taste in my mouth.1. Why the hell have they added the Dancing task (You need to dance for 1 Hour when the action takes about a second, meaning you have to spam the trigger every time you play a level) I've played this game for 20 hours and have only just crossed 30 mins of dancing. Its absolutely ridiculous.2. The achievement to triple perfect every level (Get every collectible and hit the bulls eye on all three difficulties on all 100-ish levels) was added to do nothing more than get playtime out of the game. It’s not a fun challenge. It just means that when someone looks at reviews and see's the playtime of a completionist, it looks like there is 30 hours of content, when there is actually only about 6 - 10 hours. It just seems pointless and misleading.Apart from those last two problems, this is a very fun game. It only costs a couple of quid and you can have a lot of fun with it. Just be careful as it can make you feel a bit sick at points with the constant moving of the background.7/10."

Check points, retro cartridges, keys, chests, alternate routes, and some clever methods of varying scores have been added to the Bit.Trip formula.If you're one of those people that strives to be number 1 on the leaderboards, then the developers have kept you in mind. You can now press the right trigger to do a short dance to gain some extra points in between obstacles. Loops have also been added that have you use the left analog stick to follow commander video to rack up more points. Keys and chests are also point modifiers. AND you can jump over a checkpoint (one of the greatest new additions in my opinion) to get a huge point boost.My one big issue with the game is that it seems pretty pretentious. For some reason, the developers got Charles Martinet (the voice of Mario) to be the narrator. At the risk of sounding unprofessional, the first thing I thought when I found out about this was ""okay...?"" Sure he's a great voice actor and all, but the real issue here is that the game doesn't need a narrarator at all. To the game's detriment, story elements are added at the start of the game and between levels. Sadly, I care as much about the story presented here as the Angry Birds story. Both the story and humor (if you can call it that) both fall flat here. The game would have been much better if it just stuck to its roots. Running and jumping.Whether or not the game is worth $14.99 is highly debatable. I can say that I would never spend that much money on this game. However, I got it on sale for $1.19 during a Fall Steam sale. Needless to say, that was an excellent price for this game. If you can get it on sale for around $4.99, I'd say it's a must buy.

It takes what was wrong with the first game and revamps it to make it more enjoyable.Gameplay is simple to get a hold of, and the difficulty curve rises at a good rate. The three difficulty settings allow you to tailor your experience to how much of a challenge you're after, and the ""Just Right"" difficulty provided enough of a challenge for me to enjoy the game from start to finish. There is a good amount of incentive to replaying levels with unlockable characters and costumes as well as collecting Retro cartridges.The biggest difference from the first game to this one is the addition of Checkpoints - and the best part about these is that they are optional. For someone like me, who grew rapidly frustrated with the first game, the addition of Checkpoints is a welcome change. For those who enjoy the challenge, you can simply jump over them for extra points rather than using them.Another change is the implementation of multiple pathways, which is a neat idea but I always went for the ""dangerous"" route regardless - and I did not feel the need to go back and do another path unless there was an alternate exit or a hidden treasure. Both pathways lead to the end and have the same amount of gold, so unless there's a treasure there's not much point to making the choice other than, again, deciding how much of a challenge you want.Visuals are very aesthetically pleasing and the design for the menus, cutscenes, and world map are nice and consistent. Some of the character designs were a little -too- weird for my taste but for the most part they are fun and interesting. Sound is great; Charles Martinet does some great voiceover work and the music - as to be expected - is well-suited to the gameplay and easy on the ears.I highly recommend this game.

This game looks nicer, and has a really great difficulty curve (as opposed to the first game, where the erratic curve was one of the biggest shortcomings).  New elements like slide, jump, kick, etc. are introduced at a pace that keeps things fresh without feeling overwhelming.  The music and environments are pleasant to see/hear and while the game can be difficult toward the end, I found that running through the levels was a nice way to just zone out and relax at the end of the day.

,Recommended,218060,8850830,"Posted: 25 January, 2014",all,Perpetual Explosion,"Runner2 is a major improvement from the first Runner game and addresses a lot of the problems that the last game had. The mechanics are expanded upon to further the depth of your interaction with the game. Dancing is possibly one of the best move mechanics added, being a purely optional mechanic that tests how well the player can plan out their actions for extra points. Levels are much better composed in terms of layout and rhythm, feeling much more thought out and rhythmically pleasing. The levels are much more consistent in length and difficulty, and the optional checkpoint system takes a lot of the more painful frustration out of playing while keeping the level still challenging. There are also multiple paths, marked with which path is harder or leads to an alternative exit. The sound effects that generate the random notes are much better sounding and match the key of the background music. While the game does build with difficulty, there are now three ACTUAL difficulty levels to Runner2, and a lot of the precise jumps are pushed to the collecting gold and hard mode instead of being forced to make those precise jumps in every mode. I personally like the ascetics of the world design and the more general electronica music. Also, the boss battles, which were the weakest part of the first Runner game, are very well done in Runner 2.There are some problems Runner2 still has. The bonus game at the end of a perfect run is a bit contrived. It's very different from the rest of the game, and, if you mess up on it, will require you to play the entire level again if you are aiming for a Perfect+. At the end of most levels is a point of no return, where there is only gold and no hazards; if you miss any of the golds, you cannot hit yourself to restart at the checkpoint and are forced to reset to the beginning of the level. The secret retro levels are more well done but still only have the one level background, making them a bit repetitive to the eye. One of the level mechanics, the loop-de-loop, controls very differently if your are using a controller versus a keyboard; with a controller, you have to rotate a stick to point at Commander Video, but with a keyboard, all you have to do is mash the space bar, which is much less fun and possibly easier to achieve.None of these problems should deter you from purchasing this game. I have had a very fun time with this and I hope you do too."

,Recommended,218060,8011977,"Posted: 11 December, 2013",all,Split Moon,"BIT.TRIP Presents... Runner2: Future Legend of Rhythm Alien is an amazing game. IT is a straight upgrade from the original game, and it addresses most of the first game's faults, mainly difficulty. In the first game, if you got hit in a level, you would go all the way back to the start. In Runner 2, there are now checkpoints that save your progress after reaching the halfway point in the level. And this is where the game really shines. If you dont want to use checkpoints, or want that original Bit Trip feeling, you can jump over checkpoints and skip them, which even awards you bonus points for doing so. And if you find the game too easy, you can change the difficulty.In terms of looks, Runner 2 is pleasing to look at. The graphics are pretty good, and the characters, backgrounds, environments, and objects are all very detailed, and they even interact with you ( enemy eyes will follow you as you jumpover them). They are a little jagged here and there, but they are very easy to forget about.Gameplay is very solid, and Runner 2 's gameplay is very similar to the first, with differences here and there, such as loop de loops. The game is a little hard to play on keyboard, just due to the way the keys are laid out and you cant change what key does what, but it is managable when you get used to it. The game takes plae where th first left off, and there are five worlds with a huge amount of levels. Each world has a sort of base music, but each individual level has a different remix of the song. Just like in the first, whatever you do in the level adds to the song playing( gold pieces are spaced so when you collect each one, it makes a tune that goes with the song) The game is easy to pick up, since you start out with just jumping, before the game introduces you to sliding, blocking, kicking, and many other features. It gets difficult as you go on, but if its too hard you can just turn down the difficulty. The game also has a lrge amount of replayability, some levels are locked until you have a certain amount of gold, or some lvels are locked until you beat the key vault.All in all, a very fun platformer. If you enjoyed the first, then youll love the second."

,Not Recommended,218060,8547446,"Posted: 3 January, 2014",all,thepowerglove,"A game with multiple personality disorder. Runner games are typically reserved for casual game players and the overall colorful lightheartedness supports this. On the other hand the game seems to target old-school platformers with it's unerring demands and retro sections. It also seems to target that weird audience that thought Rayman's Raving Rabbids was the FUNNIEST THING with the awkward backgrounds, adult innuendos, and a sassy dancing hamburger person.As far as the gameplay goes it's serviceable for a runner, it basically boils down to a string of quick time events, but the levels are mostly ho-hum. The problem is there are a ton of levels with little variety and many sections get terribly repetitive. There are some levels, as well as boss battles, where you can see how everything could come together if really implemented well. Unfortunately the good ideas are watered down among so many levels, I would rather see half as many levels but more tightly defined and better designed.A large part of the game is the challenge of collecting all of the gold pieces within a level. It's an interesting diversion but with the aforementioned staleness of the levels I really stopped caring about 100% completion. All the gold is used for is unlocks of further levels (didn't I say there were too many already?) Add in that the developers have added other ways to get you replay levels (hidden keys, missing the target at the end, achievements that reward you for completing a level on all 3 difficulties!?) and the repetition goes through the roof. If there were fewer well designed levels I would care more about my score, practicing to get it -just right-, but the motivation just isn't there to do it again and again 100 times over. Even the leaderboard isn't much of a motivator as many scores seem to have been gained through exploitation and you would never get close by playing the game as intended.With the constant repetition of levels the soundtrack gets old FAST. I can only platform to soothing jazz with timed bleeps for so long. Each world has essentially one song with slight variants as you play, I found the fire world to be the most engaging but the rest to be forgettable or slightly irritating. Alas with a game so focused on the tie-in with the music I would have hoped for more variety and higher quality.There are other nit-picks here and there (inescapable intro, you can't remap buttons, it often errors when looking for leaderboards) but at the end of the day the biggest issue I have is with flow. With rhythm games it's all about getting ""in the zone,"" letting the music take you as you enjoy a grand musical adventure. Games like Beat Hazard, Rock Band, or Rez have this in spades; you are moving on instinct becoming one with the music. Sadly this game rarely offered those moments often jarring me out if I started to get into it. Whether it was from the camera zooming in or out at odd times, the overly busy backgrounds creating unnecessary distractions, or the ""one hit you die"" mechanic taking me back to the start of the level due to questionable collision boxes, the game just wouldn't *let me enjoy it*.I really wanted to love this game but I've got to give it 1.5 out of 5 stars. There is a brilliant little soul hiding away somewhere in here but it is covered up by fluff and questionable design choices."

Other than that Runner 2 is much more simple and the difficulty curve is not as huge as in the first game, I never got into the first Runner game because it was too hardcore and there were no checkpoints in the level. The soundtrack is of course a huge part in this game, it helps you keeping up on the rhythm while jumping etc. Overall I'd say that this is amongst the best games that I've played this year and I recommend it to pretty much anyone who is looking for a fun game."

With over 100 levels, dozens of unlockables, lovely visuals and a wonderful soundtrack this game is a really delight to play.The premise is simple: get from one end of the level to the other in a free-flowing smooth run. But this game is not for the people who have slow reactions times or get frustrated easily. It is hard, and quite unforgiving. Repetition is going to happening in this game, but because of the quick reload and charming music, it's hard to feel put out.When you do get a great run going, it's fantastic. All the notes and melodies stiched together with your actions makes it a grand way to know you're doing well. Not to mention that it also helps timing your moments with the logical note progression.Over the multiple different worlds, there are retro levels, multiple paths and different bosses to change things up, and the dastardly combinations of different moments makes you really appreciate the level design - which may appear simplistic at times - but it very finely tuned.This game is great in short bursts for those that don't have much time, it's great for those wanting a challenge, and especially if you like the recognition for seamlessly stringing together your levels and actions. Everything about this game screams that the developer cared about making their game. From the cutscenes narrated by Charles Martinet (who also does the voice for Mario) right down to the charming animations and fluid movement.This game is something you should seriously consider purchasing, playing, loving and then realising that you have to do the whole game on all three difficulties and then all the extras and then costumes and then..."

The art is beautiful, and it's nice to see that Gaijin can make a beautiful, non-retro game. The music is wonderful as always. The gameplay, though... I normally really love music games of all sorts, but the gameplay is incredibly frustrating. The levels still go on way too long, and they're pretty hard, even near the beginning, which means that you will end up re-doing the same parts of the same levels over and over. I don't think the first Runner has a checkpoint system, and that is definitely a welcomed addition to Runner 2, but it's not enough. This game is certainly challenging, but for me, it wasn't a fun challenge at all.The keyboard controls are baffling. You can use the arrow keys and space bar, which I highly recommend over what they tell you the controls are.The BIT.TRIP series is a cool experiment in rhythm games, but Runner, for me, was a failed experiment and I don't know why that's the game that got a sequel.

,Recommended,218060,7862044,"Posted: 1 December, 2013",all,GammaGoblin,"This sequel is definitely a more well rounded and welcoming game for everyone. Runner 2 is not plagued by the uneven and harsh splike in difficulty that upset so many in the first iteration. It has much more content than the original, it has three different difficulty levels to accomidate a player's skill set, and it also now has checkpoints. For those who relished the challenge of the first game...don't worry, the hard difficulty setting will give you everything you ask for, and you have the option to skip checkpoints for bonus points. The graphical style of this game is much different and does look quite a lot better...however I think I still have a preference for the way the first game looked. The game is also narrated by Charles Martinet who is best known for doing the voicework for Mario. I imagine this will be a plus for some and an annoyance to others. As with the first game, in my opinioin the music is also very good in Runner 2 and helps to keep pushing the player through those difficult spots. The biggest issue I have with the game is how some of the achievements are tied in with the bullseye minigame event that takes place at the end of each level (assuming you have collected all the gold pieces). I think the achievements should have been related to whether you chose to skip the optional checkpoint or not, and the minigame at the end should only have served as a mechanism to increase the player's score. At the end of the day it is a very good game that will give you about five to six hours on just a normal playthrough and probably twenty plus hours if you try to 100 percent the game."

,Recommended,218060,7363548,"Posted: 11 October, 2013",all,Fox! ϡpeace,"I guess I should finally write a recommendation on this game...If you have played the first bit.trip runner and enjoyed playing it, you will probably definitely want to pick this game up.  The graphics have been shifted from 2D to a 3D setting, which actually makes this game a lot more distracting than its previous incarnation as things are going to be moving in the background a LOT.  The shift to3D models also means that there's shading on the characters, which means backgrounds and lighting does have an effect on whatever character you're playing on for a stage, so when a stage is red, it will be REALLY red.  That could be a problem for people with red-green colorblindness, but I think you could still see the outlines on completely red stages, although everything will be overlapped in grey.The music in this game is amazing, and I really enjoy the variety of music per world, as each world has its own theme.  There's a large selection of characters (plus character DLC if you want more) to run with, although they're all incredibly weird looking, which makes you wonder what the developers were thinking when designing them.  Each character feels like they have different hitboxes, but I'm assuming it's all the same even though it feels differently based on how tall/wide a character is.If you haven't played a bit.trip runner (or bit.trip game in general), this game is probably the most beginner-friendly game in the entire series.  The entire game mechanic is that you are always running, but the player is in control of dodging obstacles along the way via jumping or sliding or flying or many other things.  They have added checkpoints into the game (which are skippable for bonus points), as well as adding a dance option to gain bonus points while putting you at risk of getting slammed by a random object.  The leaderboards are fierce and competitive, and it will actually show you who the top 3 are in the stage you are on, or if you're replaying a stage, the people that are around your scoring range.The biggest downside for me in this game was the achievements they had, as they added a bullseye mechanic at the end of every level.  Basically you used to only have to collect all the gold and powerups in each level without getting hit to get a perfect, which leads you to a retro stage, and perfecting that will net you a perfect+.  In this game, you need to land a bullseye in a flash game-esque minigame after perfecting a level, but you have to do this on all three difficulties (easy/medium/hard) to get something called a triple perfect to actually 100% this game (this means getting a perfect and a bullseye at the end of the level on every stage in the game, three times).  This may sound a lot easier than how it used to be, and it is, but it just makes achivement hunting a really tedious task when you already know how to play the game.Something that really made me happy is that they seperated out retro stages, so you don't have to perfect the entire stage just to get a shot at doing the retro level again.  It's really easy to tell that they put in a lot of work into the retro stages, as it has its own music and own sprites as it goes back to the 2D environment.  The retro stages were a lot more fair (easier), and a lot more fun than bit.trip runner 1's retro stages, and there's quite a lot of them to the point where you'll probably need a guide to find them all.I would highly recommend using a controller for this game, although I think the best way to get points on some levels is using keyboard only.  I personally find the controller feel more fun and comfortable, but whatever works for you!Pick this game up if you're looking for a good entry-level game into the bit.trip series!"

I wouln't reccomend it unless you can get it on sale or unless you really like endless runners.Basically what's going on in this game is you play as a guy that is automatically running to the right for the whole game. And you have to react to what's coming up. Sometimes that means you have to collect things or jump over enemies, or slide underneath them. But it's all a bunch of timing challenges.And it's pretty fun. There's a LOT of content in this game as well. And I really liked the art style.The game also has this whole musical undertone too it all too. Basically everything you do makes a little musical sound, and the obstacles in the game are arranged in a way that it all plays in a musical rythmic sort of way. It's pretty neat, but it's nothing to get excited about either. It's cool.My big problem with the game is that its rediculously hard and you have to restart from the beginning (or checkpoint) after each time you make a mistake. It really kills my flow. This is one of those games you really can get into a groove with. Because the game scrolls at an automatic pace, your dodging things, and everything comes together musically, and the atmosphere is light and exciting... and then you make one mistake and have to get reset alll the way back. The music stops and resets and it all just feels really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ when you hit something. Especially if you messed up by accident, or just barely clipped the edge of something. It's not the game's fault, but be warned before you buy this that there is a massive amount of trial and error going on here. Its really frustrating to me and it has stopped me a number of times from deciding to load up the game.Altogether I am really enjoying the game. It's got good obstacles that are fun to dodge, good pacing so far, and it's definitly the best endless running type of game I've played.   I'd reccomend this game to almost anybody. If you like good games, this is one of them, but priced a bit high. Don't get it if you don't want a difficult game, or if you don't like trial and error type of gameplay."

Runner was my favorite in the series but was relentlessly hard, even early on. Runner 2 fixes these issues by making levels more fluid and by adding a checkpoint halfway through. The game is mostly the same, but with added obstacles and better graphics.The game plays roughly the same as the last one. Watch Commander Video and his pals run to the right while you jump kick and dance your way to the end of the level. Some added obstacles are a four-way diamond that you need to press the corresponding button when you get to each corner. Another obstacle is a loop-de-loop that you use the right analog stick to follow your character as he runs inside. Various obstacles are introduced as the game progresses and by the end you need to be quick and have all these memorized as soon as they pop up. I actually never felt overwhelmed by having to remember too many abilities, it felt just right. Levels have you ducking, jumping, using your shield to block flying blocks, kicking stop signs, and even kicking some in the air as well as while sliding. The abilities are timed to a catchy 8-bit soundtrack that is even better and richer than the last game. As you move along there are gold bars to collect as well as red plus blocks that add track to the music as you move along.These elements are what everyone loved in the first game and they stayed in this one, but the game is just more forgiving. Honestly it was more fun because I never even got to the second level in the first game. Runner 2 features bosses at the end of each level that are pretty fun and very challenging. There’s a new path feature for levels that change the difficulty depending on which path you choose. Red and green arrows will point to which path is which, the red path usually has hidden chests that unlock costumes as well as Retro Cartridges. These 25 retro levels are actually in 8-bit like they were ripped straight from an NES game. Very charming and fun to play.You are also scored by doing everything in the game. Dancing is one ability that adds 2,000 points with each move. I just found the whole game very addicting and couldn’t put the controller down. Rarely did I find a spot where I was stuck and even rarer were occasion where the game’s own design got in the way. I would fly by something so fast that I would die several times before realizing what was going on and what I had to do. The whole game is just super fun and challenging and very rewarding. If you get all the gold bars and the 4 red plus signs in the level you get to shoot yourself out of a cannon at a target to get a Perfect+ score. Very challenging but fun.The graphics look amazing with each of the 5 levels being unique. My favorite was The Bit.Trip which was level 5. You can see other Bit.Trip games being played in the background as you run along. My biggest disappointment were the lack of extra characters. There are 5, but what about Super Meat Boy and other characters from the last game? I wanted more honestly. The PC version at least gets a little extra flair with depth of field and slightly better lighting effects. This is just one artistically stunning game.Overall, Runner 2 keeps what everyone loved in the last game and adds a lot more depth and more layers of fun while being more forgiving. There are lots to collect and a ton of challenges to complete while you play. There are a few levels that were hampered by their own design flaws, and I just wish there were more unlockable characters.--Score: 9/10"
76561197986775314,Recommended,218060,15187967,"Posted: 3 April, 2015",all,Aluminum Elite Master,"It's a pretty good platformer. However, while a decent game and probably worth the cost to platformer fans, it has a host of minor things that hold it back from greatness:1) It holds your hand in regards to unlocks/secrets. Signposts tell you when a fork in the road includes a harder route (usually has a costume unlock) or an '?' route (can have either a costume unlock or an alternate exit to unlock a side-level). Even easier platformers (Super Mario World, etc.) had less hand-holding with secrets. The only semi-tricky secrets are the retro-level unlocks, which often appear in areas of the level that are moving quickly and/or demand a quick but unmarked detour.2) Unlocking new characters is merely cosmetic. After playing something like Super Meat Boy, it's surprisingly disappointing to unlock characters that don't vary whatsoever in speed, jump height, gliding, etc. It wouldn't be a big deal in other games, but in a game where you constantly move forward and have far less choice in how you approach a level, it would have been wonderful to have slight differences in characters (like maybe one can glide longer, or one can double-jump, or so forth). It would have been hard to do, but I feel like characters could have been given slightly different abilities.3) There's nothing in-game to delete your save-state, and there's nothing in-game to allow multiple play-throughs to be going on simultaneously. This is inexplicable, as even NES games had multiple save-files at times, and, barring that, most at least had a password system. For a game made in the 2010's era, it's hard to explain why there wasn't a basic 'Start New Game File' option for a PC platformer.4) Levels are a bit repetitious... there's enough variety, but there could have been more. The last two worlds really blend together the different moves of the game and force a player to extremely quickly determine what moves to use. But even here, there are only so many moves: because you never stop moving forward, and because nearly every move you can do thus is always at the same speed and height, this means that levels cannot be as varied as in other games. In most platformers, you control how fast you are moving as you approach a jump, and you also control how high you jump. Not so in Runner2. And this means that, while there are a number of interesting moves you have to use, you still end up feeling like levels are not as different from each other as you might have first imagined.For all of that, it does get enough right:+ moves/abilities are described quickly enough to allow the last worlds to really be interesting+ getting a 100% on a level is a challenge even on normal difficulty+ there are a number of optional moves to master to increase your score+ graphics are rather good+ soundtrack is quite good (though not exactly diverse)My overall opinion:Runner2 is a good change of pace for platformer fans, and definitely has some replayability if you're trying to 100% levels and compete for a high score. But it's not really a rhythm game, at least not in the way that fans of AudioSurf and so forth would expect.If anything, Runner2 is like if the music feature from Mario Paint had a baby with Sonic the Hedgehog games, thus giving birth to a fast-paced, linear platformer with a variety of moves to pull off (including optional ones) to keep the beat going as you play through the level.Ultimately, a decent game, and worth getting for platformer fans, but not as open as Super Meat Boy felt in level design and what moves to pull to get by."

Conversely, did you play BIT.TRIP RUNNER and think ""This is too easy. Please give me harder levels""? If you fell into either of these categories, then BIT.TRIP Runner2 is the game for you. If not, you probably didn't play BIT.TRIP RUNNER and you are missing out on a lot. You're probably wondering ""But wait! How can a game be both easier and harder than its predecessor?"" Good question. 10 points for you. We'll get to that later though. The original BTR was a 2D-8-bit-side-scrolling-obstacle-adventure game which incorporated rhythm-based platforming. Obscenely challenging, the game from Gaijin was played by a relatively small audience, but almost universally appreciated by its players. Cut to 2013, and its successor is released, in a more beautiful, elegant and dynamic form; Bit Trip Runner 2 (or BIT.TRIP Presents... Runner2: Future Legend of Rhythm Alien).On the surface, a game is, basically, a set of graphics, sounds and controls. The better a game can balance and sustain these elements, the better it will be, fundamentally. In all of these areas, BTR2 shines; it differentiates from the last game in the graphics sphere, upgrading to a 2.5D look with fluid motion from the characters and beautiful environments which are illustrated in a style which is similar to that of comics. All of the animations are still reminiscent of the arcade style, but have been modernized with smooth textures and motion paths (although there are still 8-bit bonus levels, likely as a tribute to the rest of the Bit.Trip universe). In terms of audio, the soundtrack is where all of the Bit.Trip games shine; in BTR2, the chiptune style of previous games has been mostly abandoned, with a huge range of acoustic and electronic instruments being used. However, the drum tracks remain in the chiptune style, which characterizes the game as one with arcade influence, but (again) modernizes it. The controls of BTR2 are largely similar to the last Runner title; however, many players claim that it is much smoother with a gamepad. Personally, I prefer a keyboard, but it does seem that gamepad support is much more optimized for BTR2 than the original BTR.You may recall earlier, when I mentioned the fact that BTR2 is both more difficult and easy than its predecessor. This is due to a couple of core game mechanic changes which have been incorporated in the newest installation in the series; for instance, there is now a checkpoint between the ""Mega"" and ""Ultra"" stages of each level (roughly halfway), which makes the game much less forgiving of late-level mistakes (a feature that was much desired by first time players of the infamous 1-11, or ""Odyssey""). Furthermore, the courses themselves appear to be slightly easier. However, there are some features which make the game much more difficult; for a start, you are required to collect every gold bar on every level to advance to the next world, which was not compulsory in BTR. Furthermore, you are granted bonus points for jumping over checkpoints, so if you wish to compete in any way against your friends list (which has an integrated leaderboard that pops up at the beginning of each level), then taking the checkpoint is a poor decision. Finally, the inclusion of dancing adds an element of time management into the game, forcing you to try to suck as many points as possible out of this small animation, but not go for a millisecond too long and force an error, and the new obstacles which require you to jump and slide at the same time require much better timing than any other obstacle in the game.In BTR2, you play as a character named Commander Video, whose apparent skill in consistently running, jumping, sliding, blocking and punching appears to have landed him within a hastily written story which somehow incorporates excessive obstacle courses into some sort of adventure. It is a captivating, heart-wrenching story which touches on themes of accepting the outsiders; the unwanted members of society. However, you're wasting your time if you play only as Commander Video, despite his well-written backstory and emotional struggles; there are a grand total of 8 playable characters, each one more interesting and enjoyable than the last. The greatest of these characters is Unkle Dill, a green alien who has various ridiculous costumes, such as a nerd outfit and a farmers' outfit, and appears to be under the influence of an extremely broad range of depressants at all times. If there was but one reason to play this game, it is Unkle Dill alone.There are a hugely large amount of video game styles in this world, and in a medium of media which is largely dominated by military FPS titles and random fantasy RPGs, it is absolutely refreshing to play something as different and varied as the arcade/modern rhythm hybrid that is BTR2. Despite the reskin of the characters and environments and the new soundtrack style, the game manages to stay true to the Bit.Trip franchise to an extreme level. Furthermore, the beautiful graphics and encapsulating soundtrack make the unforgiving madness of the game much less frustrating than the barebones angerfest that was Bit.Trip Runner. The bottom line is, for a petty price of $15, the game is completely worth it, even just for something to look at. If even this is out of your budget, a Steam sale or Humble Bundle is bound to come along which will give you the game for pennies. Either way, it is an absolute must-own, and is one of the most enjoyable and interesting titles that have been released recently.9/10"

,Recommended,218060,7805004,"Posted: 28 November, 2013",all,DoublePLayer,"This is a fantastically made game. It's a very good entry to the BIT.TRIP series and it's also a great example of how the sequels should look like. Even though this game is more of a spin-off to the original BIT.TRIP series, but that's a small detail. One thing must be said, if you didn't enjoy the first RUNNER, do not fret, as this game's difficulty curve is much more sane. The difficulty is controllable with three settings to choose which change the amount of obstacles in levels by quite a bit, unlike its precedessor, where it only removed gold bars on easy and enforced perfection on hard.BIT.TRIP RUNNER 2's story takes place right after RUNNER 1 as Commander Video gets zapped into a different dimension while chasing after the vile Timbletot. All of the cutscenes that expose the plot to the player are narrated by one and only Charles Martinez, the legendary voice of Mario, as such they're done quite well both visually and in terms of voice acting, though they're not the main focus of the game.The player's objective in BIT.TRIP RUNNER 2 is to guide the ever running Commander Videothrough quite a number of levels, 70 plus 25 secret levels. You can't stop the character in place whatsoever which is part of the challenge as you have to deal with obstacles thrown at you on the fly. Asides from such prude actions like jumping and kicking you can also dance which is a neat risk-reward action as when you dance, you can't do any other actions for half a second, but every time you do it, you get points. All of the levels, asides from the secret ones, have their own leaderboard and you can compare yourself to the world's finest and your friends which is a cool feature that makes you replay the levels trying to get the highest score. There's a tiny issue with this though, as the leaderboards from all the difficulties are combined. This causes a problem as on some levels you can get a much higher score by perfecting it on the hardest of difficulties while on others it's better to just choose 'easy' and dance through most of the level as there's a nigh negligible amount of obstacles.I mentioned gold bars earlier but there's also more collectibles to find such as + thingies that look like the core from BIT.TRIP CORE that make your mode go up. You start every level at Hyper and ascend to Mega, Super, Ultra and finally Extra. The modes change a couple of things, first of all the music changes a bit every time from getting more instruments to a very mellow and melodic state on Extra. Secondly, the character will start getting some stars going from their back finishing on a cape on Extra, as Commander Video gets a 'Rainbow' cape which doesn't have the necessary seven colors but it's pretty in its own right. The least visible change is the scoring as the modes work as a multiplier system.The game's difficulty is done in a very good way, some levels are not linear as you get to choose if you want to go the easier or the harder path and all of the levels have a checkpoint, that you can go through to do its job of becoming your new starting point when you slip up or you can jump over to get a hefty score bonus but at the risk of starting the level all over again if the player makes a mistake. The secret levels are much better done in terms of difficulty than in RUNNER 1 as they never use patterns that are either first shown in later levels or just plain don't appear outside of a singular secret level. Every single one of them tests what you should have learned by playing the regular game. Not to mention you have three tries as opposed to one and you can go back to it from the world map at any time.The worlds are littered with gold bars which allow you to access some of the harder levels and possibly unlock Commander Video's friends or costumes. They don't bring any change to the gameplay, but they're there to enjoy the levels. Like I mentioned before, some of the levels are totally skippable as you only have to go down a path that's shown to you on the world's map. Every world has its own boss too, which are quite cleverly done as they never change the rules of the game but bring their ways of hindering your progress.The graphics are quite stylish and very well done, although I can see why someone would just avoid the game due to its uniqueness. The backgrounds with their little details, the little faces on the stop signs which you have to kick, RUNNER 2' numerous details are quite amazing to look at if a bit hard considering the nature of the game, some of the details you might be able to see only by looking up videos from the game, as BIT.TRIP RUNNER 2 doesn't have a replay system. Some might complain about the animations as Commander Video instantly goes from running to sliding or kicking but I assume it's done in that way as to not confuse when you're in the necessary state to overcome the rapidly incoming obstacle. The secret levels themselves are done in a 16-bit style including the Commander Video that's known from the earlier games in the BIT.TRIP series.The music is fantastic in this game which is not a surprise considering it's a BIT.TRIP game although it might get a bit repetitive to some people as there are two tracks per world that the game switches between so on 1-1 you'll get Track A, 1-2 gives you Track B and then Track A makes its return in 1-3, and so on. This is alleviated through the mode changes as you get more meat out of one track. The secret levels get their own tracks per world which are made in a retro way, just like their graphics.Overall, I really enjoyed this game to the point where I would buy any DLC with new levels the moment it came out as I seriously would want more. Seriously though, if you're scared of this game because of RUNNER 1, try it out at someone else's place as the game unfortunately doesn't have a demo that I'm aware of."

The checkpoints are too far apart, and I found the controls unsatisfying. I know, I know, L2P, but after half an hour it was more frustrating than fun. Also, the game loves its sparkly graphics to the point where it allows them to occlude your vision. That is not okay. Refunded."

First, the game is sickeningly hipster, which would be find if the soundtrack didn't also become a casualty. Its the same music from the first game, reworked to be on an apple television commercial. Its worse.There's also a small (but massively noticable if you played the original) control lag in the new content.. No idea why, i can only guess its related to the animations. What's really nuts is gaijin haven't forgotten how to make razor sharp responsive controls, the retro bonus stage is exactly the controls from the original.The last problem i have is difficulty balancing in the sequel.. in the original, both finishing the levels and getting all the gold bricks were tied to the curve.. ie, if you had the skill to finish it, you could nearly always collect all the gold bricks. Here, they've made it stupidly easy to finish a level, but to compensate, made getting all the bricks more of an exercise in memory, which is a real cheap way to get replayabilty.Damn hipsters :)"

This one, I think, is actually tuned and polished enough to be well worth the time anyway. The melding of gameplay and music works perfectly as a sort of audio-visual mnemonic to help learn the more difficult sequences. The checkpoints are an incredibly welcome addition vs. something like Rayman Jungle Run, allowing you to perfect subsections at a time instead of having to do the entire level start to finish or sacrifice your Perfect. In my opinion it strikes an excellent balance, being challenging while never making you feel as if it's unfair or that you're wrestling with bad controls.

There are secrets and more than one pathway and reason to re-visit each level.I didn't find out about dancing until half way through the game but hell ! That only made it more fun by making my Pickle dance between danger.I do kind of miss the more simple graphics of the first Bit Trip and this has old school levels as secret areas, but overall I felt the level design was mucn better in this one.

,Recommended,218060,8999041,"Posted: 6 February, 2014",all,Timed Hits Knower,"Calling this game a rhythm game is disingenuous. It's certainly a musical game, but it is not a rhythm game. It's a musical action game.The goal of Runner 2's levels is not to have your button presses be in time with the music, or to match the music. The goal of Runner 2's levels is to -create- music. You don't play the levels, you perform them. Much like reading music from a sheet of paper, you read the levels as they scroll by, and you respond to what the level tells you. Looking at the obstacles directly in front of Commander Video is going to make you lose. A musician does not look at the note he is playing, because he's already playing it. You can't react to the obstacle that you should already be dodging. This means that even though your actions reflect the music, it's not in the sense of pressing the button in rhythm. In a strict rhythm game, the music is already happening, and you simply follow the beat and are graded based on how well you do. In Runner 2, the beat follows you. The music and the rhythm is created by your actions- it can't exist without you playing it.Many people go in to this game expecting it to be a timed-button rhythm game. It frustrates them because they feel a dissonance when the beat or note that occurs from their input happens after they had already done it. The game doesn't allow for failure either. The level never slows down for you or allows you play a wrong note. You're performing the level, you're not allowed to mess up.This all sounds kind of difficult, and it can be if you play on the harder difficulties (which are the fun ones). Making music isn't supposed to be easy. But when you learn how to play, it's a very calming experience. Even though you're quickly pressing buttons and reacting to dozens upon dozens of obstacles that will halt your momentum in one hit, you're also listening to the rhtyhm of your actions, and you get the feeling that you're actually playing a song.Visually the game looks great and it's got a good art style. The amount of stuff to unlock gives good reason to replay levels and adds value to the experience. One thing that makes this game great for anyone is you can choose to make it easy on yourself through optional checkpoints and difficulty that can be changed any time outside of a level. My one complaint is sometimes looking at the screen intently, which you often have to do during tough parts, can be a strain on the eyes. My other complaint is that the scoring system can sometimes get wonky, but that only affects my ego, and not the gameplay.In conclusion, music is art, this is a game where you perform music, this game (and therefore all games) is/are art."

Though the difficulty rise was a bit inconsistent, all in all it was well balanced with my progressing abilities.I have played the original game twice: once on normal mode and the other on perfect mode, in which you had to collect ALL the coins.

,Recommended,218060,3474439,"Posted: 16 May, 2013",all,Yargles,"BIT.TRIP Presents... Runner2: Future Legend of Rhythm Alien (Runner2 for short) is an auto scrolling rhythm based platformer (or what I like to call it). I naturally love rhythm games and spend way too much time playing them but this is less of a rhythm game and more of a platformer.Content:There are tons of levels and each level has 3 difficulty levels, so if you have the patience to beat each level three times on different difficulty levels, the game has lots of replay value. Add on the collectables and leaderboards and you could spend lots of time in this game. It took me around 10 hours to finish it at first on Rather Hard (hardest difficulty) and almost triple that time to get Triple Perfect+ on each level (which you can achieve by completing each difficulty perfectly on said level) so I personally got tons out of this game. Let’s not forget the 20 hidden stages and hidden costumes too!Graphics and Performance:The graphics are very appealing and are a step up to the first six games in the BIT.TRIP series. If you have a weakish computer, you shouldn't have much of a problem running this game @ 60fps, just make sure to turn the depth of field off. Unfortunately that (and resolution) is the only graphics setting you can change.Sound + Music:As expected from a rhythm game, the music is some of the best (in my opinion) of what I've heard from a rhythm game. The developers even got the voice actor of Mario (Charles Martinet) to do the narration!Controls:Finally, the controls are great and responsive on the 360 controller and all the actions are where it should be. Even though I (and the game for that matter) highly recommend using a controller, the keyboard configuration is great and does the job properly once you get used to it.Final Thoughts:If you are a rhythm and/or platformer fan, I highly recommend you pick this game up. With lots of content, appealing graphics and an amazing soundtrack, the $15 asking price is a solid price. If you want, you can get the optional $3 DLC that adds characters like Atlas, Razputin and Dr. Fetus who of which all look great, but these are just characters, no extra levels or abilities."

Checkpoints are a great addition which the first game needed badly; due to the 'trial and error' nature of this game. The sound design is beautiful (although the original was too), the visuals are much nicer and still retain the retro charm of the first game. The only problem with it is that the whole concept feels that it would be much nicer as a mobile game rather than a desktop/console game; although that's just my opinion.For 99p (90%) off on the Steam sale, a definite bargain!

Well, you probably should save your money on this one. There’s a reason it’s officially called ‘BIT.TRIP presents… Runner 2’.‘Runner 2’s art style is miles away from 8-bit retro pixels and needs quite a bit of getting used to it. But the core gameplay is still there, making it the perfect sequel: So familiar, yet so strange.With its five worlds, levels that have multiple paths and sometimes even exits, and different collectibles [characters, costumes, retro levels], you could almost consider ‘Runner 2’ a “Metroidvania-lite”, i.e. content-wise you get your money’s worth.The difficulty is, initially, somewhat lower than ‘Runner’s, but the new obstacle types will make up for it wholesale in the end. So much in fact, that you will be thankful for the checkpoint in each level [which you can skip for extra score].All in all, very much recommended for any fan of ‘Runner’s gameplay."

The first Runner's charm (or even the original Bit.Trip series charm as a whole) was the combination of simplicity and insanity. The art style was simple, the music was simple and enjoyable, the commands were simple and difficulty grew on chaotically (though in a seemingly natural way). Runner 2's mistake is all of this. The art style is fancier, but forgettable; the music is tiringly repetitive (excluding the third world's - Supernature's - themes); the commands try to be unnecessarily a little bit more complicated; and difficulty by level design doesn't make you feel like you're being challenged. Actually, the few more challenging parts are so misplaced that you feel like ""finally I beat it, I was getting bored"" instead of ""hell yeah! I DID it!"" Moreover Charles Martinet's narration, albeit short, isn't as brilliant as you'd expect. Also the game fails when it tries to be funny - yep, I'm talking about the costumes and the dance moves.Overall the game isn't bad. It just feels like just another game you'll forget soon, or worse, like a ripoff of the original Runner instead of its sequel. I definitely can't say I recommend it.Give it a shot, though, if it has at least a 70% discount. Otherwise, stick to the originals and you'll save some good bucks.Score: 5/10Eu não posso dizer que eu gostei de verdade desse jogo. O charme do primeiro Runner (ou mesmo o charme de toda a série Bit.Trip original) era a combinação de simplicidade e insanidade. A arte era simples, a música era simples e agradável, os comandos eram simples e a dificuldade crescia caoticamente (mas de uma maneira que parecia natural). Runner 2 peca em todos estes aspectos. A arte é mais trabalhada, mas é esquecível; a música é cansativamente repetitiva (exceto pelos temas do terceiro mundo, Supernature); os comandos tentam desnecessariamente ser um pouquinho mais complicados; e a dificuldade através do level design não faz com que você se sinta desafiado. Na verdade as poucas partes mais complicadas são tão mal distribuídas que você se sente ""até que enfim consegui vencer, já tava de saco cheio"" ao invés de ""AE ♥♥♥♥♥, CONSEGUI"". Além de tudo, a narração do Charles Martinet, mesmo que curta, não é tão brilhante quanto você esperaria. E o jogo fracassa quando tenta ser engraçado - sim, tô falando das fantasias que cada personagem pode usar e das danças.No geral o jogo não é ruim. Você só sente como se ele fosse mais um jogo qualquer que será esquecido rápido ou, pior, como se ele fosse uma cópia do Runner original ao invés de sua sequência. Eu definitivamente não posso dizer que o recomendo.Mas experimenta, se for o caso, se ele estiver com tipo uns 70% de desconto. Caso contrário, fique com os originais e você vai ter poupado uma grana boa.Nota: 5/10"

This sequel, however, I didn't like. The game usually has your character jump a beat after you actually hit the button, making precise movements almost impossible. I used the game on easy mode, but it was still hard for me to get into (and hard overall). One of the only reasons why I decided to buy this game was because of the Good Friends character pack, which included Quote from Cave Story, a 2D shooter which I worship and you should too. Anyways, about Runner2. I never got why the name was so long. Just call it ""BIT.TRIP Runner2"" or something. ""Future Legend of Rhythm Alien"" is pretty unnessicary for the name.

I had never played a Bit Trip game before and didn think it would be the type of game I would enjoy playing. So this is for the people who have never played a game of this type before.It's more or less a music based game. You avoid enemies and collect gold through each level. The music in this game is amazing and addicting to listen to. When you progress through the level, each enemy you avoid and each pile of gold you collect is in time with the sound track. It gets very addicting to play through a game to the beat of music.The graphics are incredibly pleasing to the eye. Although, my only gripe about this game is sometime there can be too much going on in the background and it can be a tad distracting from the gameplay.

You can have fame and money, but not all Bit Trup Runners 2 achievements, boy. Well or you can. But It’s hard.BTR2 is a beautiful, addictive runner that takes you across the universe. The mechanics are simple, but keep getting more and more complicated every level. When you realize, it’s all about jumping, sliding, kicking in the air, sliding again and shielding in a short space of time. Man, It even has final bosses! On a runner! You bet it!There is a lot to get in BTR2: gold, hidden levels, keys, chests, skins, characters... Enough to spend a lot of hours across every level, dodging weird enemies without stop jumping.World design is lovely: colourful, 3d and very beautiful. It helps a lot when we get stuck in a level and have to keep repeating from the checkpoint. Because BTR2 is difficult! Sometimes even in easy mode (depending also if you’re a filthy casual player). On another side, the soundtrack is cool and with positive vibes (I usually listen to it while drawing or writing).Indeed this is a great game for having fun and has a lot of difficulty to offer for those who love challenges. In my humble opinion the full price is worth. BTR2 has no DLCs and nothing can be bought with real money. You have to earn everything with your sick jumping skills, mate!"

Having played the original, I can say that Runner2 is a huge improvement over an already excellent concept.Running to the right has been done many times before... BUT the BIT.TRIP Runner series is great in that it is the love child of a side-scrolling platformer and a rhythm game (such as DDR, Beatmania, or dare I say Guitar Hero).Adding the dance move to be done in between jumping, kicking, sliding, and blocking adds an element of danger to the game. You need to dance to get the highest score possible, but dancing makes it so much easier to miss things. I also like the addition of checkpoints. Some may think it's unfair to the original, but with the new additions of the sequel, I welcome a mid-level checkpoint with open arms. I am glad that the decision was to put only one checkpoint per level, it would be too easy with more.And the graphics. The graphics! Everything is so nice and soft like the art jumped into a bathtub full of cotton swabs, except the stick part was taken off and it's just a bathtub ful of the cottony parts of the swabs. I guess that would be a bathtub full of cottonballs... Regardless, everything is very smooth, and for the lovers of the original, there are some retro levels thrown in as well. The good friends character pack DLC also has some impressive graphics and animations, but that's a different review.This game can and will be super challenging and frustrating as heck. You might find yourself replaying some of the levels hundreds of times. I know in my nearly three hours (one playthrough, mind you), I only made it through a handful of levels.

Thanks to the freedom of Steam I was able to play this game all the way through on my super modest Radeon HD4350 video card. Thank you Steam.So Runner 2. Is it as good as the first installment? Well for me no. Some will be more attracted to Runner 2 simply because of the more modern graphic style vs. the first Runner's Retro 8-bit 3D graphics. The gameplay is still extremely tight as in the first Runner and the game is still extremely fun but there are a few things that keep this one from beating the first. First of all the music is also now more modernized and no longer has the chiptunes that I love so dear and the gameplay has been dumbed down quite a bit to allow for more accessability. Even on hard which adds alot more obstacles in your way Runner 2 is still not as challenging as the first game. Also there are check points in the middle of every level for pansies who whine about starting at the beginning if they screw up which can thankfully be skipped for a higher score. However there are checkpoints in every boss fight which makes them stupidly easy compared to the boss fights in the first Runner. I finished the game's larger 5 worlds in half the time it took me to finish 3 smaller worlds in the first Runner. That was kinda disappointing but grading this game based on it's own merit without comparing it to the first Runner, Runner 2 is still a first class title that should not be missed by fans of the old, or brand new fans. The music is still awesome, I still had a blast playing and highly recommend you play it too."

,Recommended,218060,5671259,"Posted: 27 July, 2013",all,Dr. Fetus,"Did you like BIT.TRIP RUNNER? Or at least the general gameplay of it? (The autorunning, jumping ducking, collecting gold, things like that.) But hated how the difficulty curve was all over the place, that a lot of the levels were really long, and had absolutely no checkpoints? And having to perfect a stage in order to get one try at a bonus stage that was trickier than the stage itself? Well don't worry, because Runner 2 fixes a lot of problems that the first game had!Runner 2, is a really fun game. And it's clear that the developers had a ton of fun making it. (Or were on a ton of drugs.) Charles Martinet (I'm pretty sure you know who he's well known for voicing. If not, get out of that rock you're under) is the narrator for the game's cutscenes and menus, and it's very charming to hear his narration over the whimsical lines in this game. The game itself is a lot more forgiving than Runner was. For one thing, there's checkpoints, which makes Runner 2 a lot more forgiving than Runner. Don't worry, for those of you that got far enough in Runner to know what I'm about to talk about, there's nothing like Odyssey or The Gauntlet in this game. Gaijin Games finally learned what a difficulty curve was, and the game doesn't have any huge spikes in difficulty. And the game has a difficulty selection, which actually does something meaningful in this game such as removing or adding obstacles, unlike Runner, which either removed the optional gold, or forced you to collect them. And if checkpoints aren't your thing, you can also jump over them in order to skip them, which gives you a huge point bonus and lets you make the game as difficult or as easy as you want, which makes it really accessible.Gaijin Games didn't fully learn their lesson about game design stupidity though. While you don't have to go through a bonus stage anymore by perfecting a level, you have to do a cannon shooting minigame, and if you mess up, you'll have to redo the stage if you want to get a Perfect +, which can get really annoying if the stage you went through was a tough one. Better than going through a bonus stage to get that though. Bonus stages are their own thing in this game, they're a lot fewer in number, and are nowhere near as tricky as the retro stages in Runner. Also you have 3 attempts to go through the stage, and can retry immediately if you happen to lose all 3 lives.The gameplay has a lot of the elements from Runner, plus a few new moves, such as jumping and ducking at the same time, or ducking and kicking at the same time which can cause you to do a bunch of crazy maneuvers in some levels. There's also obstacles which can't hurt you, but give you a lot of points if you do them right. There's also dancing, which does nothing but lock you into a dance animation for 2 seconds, but gives you some points for doing so. Unfortunately means that you have to spam the dance button at every opportunity in order to get a high score, and adds a layer of frustration to the game if you're the kind of person who likes score attacking.Unfortunately, one of the game's biggest problems are it's visuals. They're not bad, they're really good looking. Too good looking, to the point where in some levels, it can get hard to see your character and the obstacles ahead, which can cause you to make a mistake and force a restart. It 's pretty frustrating when that happens, and it gets really bad in the last 2 worlds. Also if you're into really hard games, Runner 2, even at max difficulty and skipping all the checkpoints never gets as hard as any of the other BIT.TRIP games. Of course for most people, this would be a good thing, as they were difficult games by just being ridiculous and having an unreasonable difficulty curve.In short, this game is really good and much better than BIT.TRIP RUNNER was, and you should go and get it."

I wasn't this OCD with Runner1.  Point of this comment? It's addictive.  It may be repetetive, but it's fun.  It's rhythmic.  You'll find yourself lost in the music alone if you listen closely with the beats you make.Avoiding that check-point, even on easy mode, can be psychological mind♥♥♥♥ at first.  Jump over it, and one might start thinking ""Oh man, I can't screw this up.  I can't.""  However, the learning curve of this game is much more gentle this time around, as opposed to the first Bit.Trip Runner game - at first, on 'just right,' it may seem that the whole game is easy - later on in world 2, however, the game stops screwing around, takes the kid gloves off, and says ""Have fun~!""Retro Challenges this time around are a little easier to come by and are gentle enough at first, but the learning curve is much more vicious on these.  After the third one you come across, do expect to have to retry it if you're a completionist.  However, and this is where the cons begin, if you do manage to fail (by either getting hit 3 times or miss a gold or two,) you can just restart the challenge straight from the menu - whereas with Runner1, if you failed that challenge you had to go back to th the beginning of the stage and collect all the gold bars.  I can understand the reasoning behind this change, as you had to find the challenge to begin with in Runner2, but it's a minor nuance at best.Con #2, and this is a very /very/ minutè complaint - the voice that calls out your power-ups (Mega, Super, Ultra, and Extra,) in this game sounds...weak, airy, where as with the first one, you as the player, could feel the power coming from that voice.  It's barely noticible when you actually get a Core-Beat.But don't let these two cons deter you from playing this game.  They're two minor, personal complaints at most.  Buy this game.  BUY IT.  There's so much fun to be had with this game, either with completing it, or just running through the stages once or twice.  Seven hours just by completing the first 2 worlds again on all 3 difficulties and I'm no where near done with it.  This is easily the best $15 I've ever spent.What? You're still reading this?

As an auto-runner, gameplay is fast-paced, demanding quick reflexes to avoid obstacles.Runner 2 is significantly easier than its predecessor, Bit Trip, which was punishing from the very beginning and had a somewhat steep learning curve. Runner 2 does a great job gradually introducing new mechanics into the mix and the difficulty level can be easily adjusted to your play style. Checkpoints can also be skipped for the reward of extra points as well. The 3D graphics also allow for asthetics and camera angles that were not possible in the first game.Gameplay does not seem to be repetitive, at least not yet. I have just started World 5 and I'm still enjoying the game. For those looking to 100% games, there's lots of replay value in collecting all the gold and achieving perfect on each level, as well as finding the secret retro stages and unlocking all the costumes and characters.I can't think of any major flaws, but the color palette for World 4 is a bit strong. Trying to focus while staring at the bright red color scheme is a bit hard on the eyes.Other than that, I highly reccommend Runner 2, especially if you're into platformers, rhythm games, or platorming rhythm games."

RUNNER is the game that needed a sequel the most: It was loved by Nintendo fans, and hated by SPUF users, and worked the best in line with an actual game. Designed with the PC in mind, it's a breath of fresh air like no other. Pretty much the only thing that remains from the original is the gameplay. The map system, difficulty settings, secret paths, and virtual ""new car smell"" (new car... paint?) make this so much of a better game than the original, you'd be hard pressed not to want to see Commander.Video go on entirely new adventures of the ilk. It has the voice of Mario, too.There is one major flaw to this game, however; one that renders this entire exercise doomed by unfortunate heavy matter baggage. That is, this game is almost unplayable without using a controller. The first RUNNER had it completely fine using keyboard controls, so I don't have any idea why they needed to change them for the sequel. Therein the problem lies with having both hands uncomfortably bunched up in one part of the device, which makes pressing the keys seem so wierd when you should be able to re-map the arrow keys to jump and such.Okay, so maybe it's not that bad, but still, the point remains that even the guy that beat Super Meat Boy at 106% with a keyboard couldn't tolerate this. This was the game that got me an Xbox 360 controller (thankfully it was a birthday present, so I didn't have to pay),  and after just a few minutes of play I could tell that this game was designed, like many others, with a gamepad in mind. So, this is great, but you should be cautious of the leaps and bounds you might have to make if you want to get into it."

Lots of stuff to unlock like new characters and costumes, and loads of achievements to collect, some of which are pretty difficult even for the experienced gamers out there. Also a huge hit with my kids, we have spent so much time playing and still go back to it once in a while. Definitely recommend, especially on sale!"

It eases you in, making you learn one thing at the time, instead of just expecting you to know how to do 5 things at ones, which is something I really appreciate. I recommend this game for sure!"

Just a couple gripes: slightly annoying that beating a level on a harder difficulty doesn't count for the easier difficulties as well, and the dang target minigame at the end of every perfect attempt is the bane of my existence. At least if I screw up elsewhere I can go back to the checkpoint at the halfway mark, but miss the bullseye and you have to go back to the start if you want that Perfect+. Also, while the visuals are great, they can be kinda overwhelming and distracting from the actual gameplay.One last thing: I love the dance button and ability to skip checkpoints, and despite not caring where I end up on the leaderboards I can't stop myself from constantly abusing both to wring every possible point out of a level even if it makes my life 10 times harder."

I generally like platforming games and I also liked the work of the developers who also worked on the binding of issac and meatboy. As a result I ended up buying this game with my own money and was not dissapointed. This game recomends using a gaming console but I can assure you it can also be played using a laptop of computer keyboard easily. This levels progressively get more difficult which is something I look for in a game. Something I was seriously impressed with was the artwork and music in this game- some of the best I have witnessed in my gaming history. This is a true testimont to the designers of the game and if you enjoy the graphics then you should check out their other work on meatboy and the binding of issac. Another pro of this game is the challenge aspect. This generates a sense of comeptitivness between yourself, your friends and global players. The challenge aspect also refers to the amount of content in the levels. You can find alternate paths and secrets in each level. For those of you who love to achieve 100% this game is certaintly for you.  The only con I would mention is that this game can get a bit repetitive in some aspects. However, overall this game is amazing especially for those who love platforming games.Overall score- 4.5/5"

In a music game you want to have amazing music that matches perfectly and this has that. The music on its own would seem quite calming but as soon as you put the music and gameplay together it becomes the most stressful thing ever.Only issues I have with this game. One I suck at timing however I can handle missing a jump and having to restart or go back to check but those GOSH DAMN TARGETS! The missing of those targets usually is followed by a rage quit, the amount of time I have hit slightly under the line would make a grown man cry. The only other issue I have is the intro sequence playing everytime I open the game, I get it I have watched it over 10 times I do not need to see the characters flying in space again.All in all awesome game definitly worth it, pick it up if you love rhythm games or if you like that basically impossible completionist challenge."

These games are often something I haven't enjoyed, however, something about this one was enjoyable and memorable.Here's what I liked:- Not random generated- Multiple difficulties- Boss battles are fun and engaging- Levels are short BUT- Can be challenging (difficulty)- Music- Pacing- Long enough to engage- Short enough to keep interestThe retro levels are tough! Unlockables are tough!Not much that was unenjoyable."

,Recommended,218060,35010636,Posted: 16 September,all,Soluzik,"I absolutely adore this game. I remember looking at in the Wii Shop and debating on wether I should get this or the first Runner. I went with the first one and what a huge mistake it was.Things I like:-Different Characters-Checkpoints-Soundtrack is phenomenal-Different Costumes for each character (not including DLC characters)-DLC Characters-Great Visuals-Can run on most computers (even my crappy laptop)-Voice Acting by Charles Martinet (you may know him as Mario)-Unique Boss BattlesThings I hate:-Lazy Character Selection (Retro CommanderVideo)-Introducing mechanics way too early or way too late-The first minute of the game is company logos, custom ads, title screen, info bit, the actual title screen, the world selection, and the level selection-Difficulty Spikes-Useless Mechanics (like that wierd wheel thingy)-Rewards and Achievements make newcomers think they're the same thing-Repetitive music7/10The game is fantastic with great level design, unique characters, and an actual storyline. However, it's a bit too hard and it's also hard to get used to the controls."
