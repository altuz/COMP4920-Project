If you want to play it get 2 more friends to come with you.Not going to recommend the game because it lacks solo-ability. The bots you play with are horrible. Anything beyond the most easy difficulity is impossible.

Your character will teleport, and sometimes several seconds of action will be missing and then happen instantly, making you dead.This happens even when you are playing with a friend living near you... in some huge city where the internet is fast no less. So I can safely say it's not my hardware, but the game which is broken.There are many good ideas in this game, but sadly when a technical issue makes your multiplayer game unplayable in multiplayer, it invalidates everything you've done.Can we dream for a fix? Sadly, it's unlikely to happen at this point. But who knows?Unless that unlikely improvement happens, avoid this game. It's kinda worse than the game just being bad on all levels, because it feels like we're missing on a pretty fine experience here..."

The only reason why you would want to buy and subsequently play this game is if you had a bunch of friends who also want to do so. As it is, the game is dead. There's very few people who still play and since this game is absolutely horrible with AI (and even if it had decent AI, it wouldn't be fun for long) you'll have a bad time.The gameplay involves you either dungeoncrawling through a fun, cartoony dungeon filled with monsters and traps while playing one of three classes (who also split up into 3 specializations). All of those have a very different role: The warrior is clearly the tank, the rogue is perfect for annihilating big foes and the mage is support and AoE damage.The group dynamic between the 3 players is great and lots of fun, but it's way more fun to be the 4th one: The Dungeon Maestro. In this gamemode you get to direct the dungeon! You can use spells to actively harm the players, you can place monsters and even minibosses to create obstacles or make already premade monsterpacks even scarier and at the end you even get to control a huge Boss yourself!You can take different kinds of ""cards"" (which are either monsterpacks or spells) with you, and the variety and combo-potential is pretty cool. Almost all of the 22 hours I have put into this game are from this mode, aside from farming for some hero items via an exploit (which has been fixed though). I'd still be playing it, if other people were to, too.As it stands, the game isn't really playable anymore. If you do have 3 friends and a bunch of free time, get a 4 pack. Now. The game's tons of fun and very unique, and you'll laugh your asses off (while cursing the wretched Dungeon master, of course)!If you do not though...Don't bother. Paradox, if you ever revive a game, do a Dungeonland 2 and support it like crazy!"

,Recommended,218130,9953929,"Posted: 27 April, 2014",all,baniann,"The great strength of this game is in how easy it is to get everything up and running for fast-paced multiplayer. Drop in and drop out online co-op and mechanics that are basic enough that any skill level can start playing and get something out of it. Everything is shared and the gameplay is all about working together and helping each other out in order to survive. Difficulty is also quite flexible, though I think there should be a ""normal"" mode added.Something important that is understate though.. you don't level up, there isn't loot, and the weapons/armor to buy is all for show. This was very jarring to me at first since even pure action and hack n slash games often dabble in at least some of these elements. Dungeonland makes use of certain accessory slot items that create new, sometimes a bit convoluted abilities and passive skills for characters. Those, along with truly mastering how a character controls are key to being successful in this game. There isn't an RPG-like focus on growing and getting stronger. You grow and get stronger by becoming more proficient at controlling your character and working well with others.While I am terrible at it, the dungeon master mode must also be mentioned because it's unique and rather amusing. Basically you can become the ""bad guy"" and be in charge of dispersing enemies, traps, and goofy manipulations of your foes (bots, or other players in co-op) on the battle field. Oh, and there is a button to press to laugh maniacally just for fun. Most of the more interesting unlockables are located in this mode.As for whether the all access pass is worth getting.. it definitely is. The free to play version has substantially less worlds and you'll see more interesting battle scenarios (being able to ride creatures, deal with more environmental hazards, etc) and much more varied graphics and enemy types by going all-access.Overall, a recommendable game."

It's a top-down action RPG where three players have shared lives and are pitted against a person that tries to kill them. It's an interesting game with a very goofy aesthetic.Unfortunately, Paradox wouldn't recognize a tutorial if it bit them in the face. You must go into the options and read the How to Play section, because the game will not tell you anything otherwise. Pair that with an unapologetically brutal difficulty, and you have a game that tries very hard to be inaccessible for newcomers.It looks like there's a bit of depth here if you're willing to scale the mountanous difficulty curve.

,Not Recommended,218130,7839863,"Posted: 30 November, 2013",all,Kuehnau,"I pre-ordered Dungeon Land, I gave into the hype that it was generating, only now after it was too late do I realize that most of that hype was from two things; being an indie game and being from a developer in Brazil.Dungeon Land is mostly a poorly planned ""Gauntlet"" clone, placed in the theme of a Theme Park. Sounds like a good idea right? It should have been an amazing game and the developers messed up badly.To begin with, although Dungeon Land is set in a Theme Park setting, you wouldn't realize it. The special events that happen are very few and far between, there's a complete lack of mini games and character customization is the equivalent of dressing dolls.Theme Parks are notorious for over priced food, hard games of ""skill"", rides, actors in suits and expensive vendors. Dungeon Land has almost none of that. Each stage usually has a single ride ""event"" that boils down to a mini boss before you eventually make your way to the end boss and most of these events are poorly thought out.You collect gold in the game, but only to buy skill upgrades or new costumes. Costumes do nothing but change how your character looks. I thought part of the appeal of a dungeon crawl was finding all sorts of loot. I mean, wouldn't it have been awesome if they had random venords in stages selling different kinds of gear and stuff? Well, forget that. You don't get that.The character AI is awful, if you can't find enough people to play with, the character AI is going to be the reason why you die. Me and my friends have literally watched in horror as the last surviving player, a NPC, runs into a wall and does nothing else while being murderd by hordes of enemies. It's awful.To add further insult to injury, the game is now Free-to-Play, everyone who bought the game gets a kick in the butt and that's about it. But don't worry, there's more ""content"" for you to buy now if you want.In all honesty I think this was the plan from the beginning, get as much cash flow from paying members as possible, then after all intrest is lost in their crappy, shoddy, ill thought out game, they make it free to play to bring in even more money. I'll never trust this developer again."

76561198019405086,Recommended,218130,3242539,"Posted: 30 January, 2013",all,Gai-Gin-German,"Dungeonland...how am I Supposed to describe it? First off, it is hard, especially in singleplayer. This game is all about teamwork, because even the death of a single one of the trio (Mage, Warrior, Rouge, the classy combination) can cause the GROUP to lose! Whilst some might rant and yell about this being unfair, it is actually forcing you to keep wary of your actions, because every single mistake is punished by the game.The classes, even the warrior, have LOW health and die very fast, which means this is not a run n' gun sort of arcade game. This is, especially in the higher difficulcies (with ADDITIONAL handicaps for pure torture that are optional), enforcing teamplay because the group has a shared 1-Up pool that is empty after 1 Wipe in general. On the other hand the Heroes can power up and kill enemies rapidly, unless a boss shows up for a tough time. This factor of random spawning is even more fun (and with ""fun"" I mean lethal) in the Dungeonmaster Mode. Here can a fourth player take the role of the guy behind the scenes by spawning monsters, traps, towers, use spells etc. This is fairly balanced though and the system is throught up throughly and in my opinion a good base for MANY eventful Hours in Co-Op with a DM.Lastly, there is just one negative thing I need to bring up, the low amount of content, which again is different with every difficulcy and additional handicaps. A fifth map is slated as ""Coming soon"" and there is a HIGH chance of a lot of content getting added some time after launch (aka NOW). My recommendation is, that if you have friends (two or three of them) and if you are resistant against frustrating moments, then you should consider this game as an alternative for a fast-paced arcade Co-Op game, which also allows you to be the one for once who is in charge of all the goons of the place.tl;dr A fast-paced arcade RPG Game for three to four friends that is ranging from hard to brutal in terms of difficulcy and allows to control the monsters yourself for once. Not a lot of content, more to come though and therefore I rate it with a 4/5 and a 8.5/10"

I had constant frame drops and found that the only way to fix it was to plug in a game pad (even if I was not using it). Have they resolved some of the bugs? I'm not sure. Paradox is getting known for fun and interesting games that need more testing.The playlers vs GM mode is fun as long as everyone is trying to have fun and not game the system. I don't think this is a solo ARPG that I'd recommend for anyone even as a free to play now. And don't get me started about some of the Steam controversy about when the game switched to F2P."

Your goal is to survive the dungeons using one of three characters the rogue, mage, and warrior collecting gold along the way to unlock new weapons, perks, potions and much more! The gold is shared MEANING all the gold you collect goes to everysingle team mate aswell as the dungeonmaster if it is a human player.The most unique feature from this game is being able to play as the dungeonmaster himself and placing monsters, traps, and structures how you want in your dungeon. You use gold collected from playing as heroes and or being the dungeon master to unlock cards which can be traps, structures, boss monsters, standard monsters ect and you draw these cards at various points in the game to use against the heroes, you can be as douchy as you please or you can have a nice fun yet challanging dungeon aslong as you have the mana to cast the cards which recharches over time and at various check points.After very losely covering what you can do in the game the conclusion is: this game is phenominal IF you have friends. It can be alright by yourself or with randoms online but by far have some friends to play it with itd make the experiences that much more entertaining. Being a new game there are bugs, hell i was outside the map once and couldnt get back in.. we lost.  Ping is also a factor also, as Rossinna mentioned in his review incase he reads this, terrible ping will create unplayable lag and AI dungeon masters will feast on that lag and make your life HELL.

Me and my friends cannot join on each others games, we tried everything. If you search the forums here and on the web you can see that it is not uncommon.

The DM mode is so far fun if a bit cheap at times when the DM gets an invisable spinning cow of death then proceeds to beat you to death. Yes that happened. Good game otherwise, my only other thing is that the connection for me at least is a bit shaky not sure if that is just me or the netcode. A 9.5/10 recommended!"

At least not for very long.Allow me to explain why that's relevant, and why I don't recommend this game, even though I love it. The one worthwhile mode is the GM mode, where one player is the GM, controlling tricks, traps, and monsters to beat three other players struggling to the goal. For people who believe themselves cunning (regardless of if they are in reality) and enjoy pulling the strings to create a challenge and experience for other players, this is a real great game for you. I'm one of those types, and I sincerely enjoyed splitting my friends apart and trying to pick them off, sowing discord and trying (with varying results) to surprise them at every turn.However, for those who come to this game with the intent of playing as a hack and slash hero, which is advertised and is forced upon three of the four players every round, you will get bored of this fairly quickly. All the fun of the GM mode is for the GM to have, the players essentially running a gauntlet to the end. Some players get stressed or bored with how little they can actually do, and it in essence becomes a forced march to the end. The GM is given all sorts of ways to express his cunning and strategy, but the players? Kill what's in front of you and progress. Hardly exciting.This loops me back to my first comment. I enjoyed playing GM, so I like this game. My friends did not as much, or got sick of playing adventurer when I was GM, and eventually lost interest. I feel like this is less a story about me and my friends than it is a story pointing out a major flaw with the design of this game.In summary, while GM mode is fun, it seems to only be fun for the GM. You can take turns being GM with your friends, but in the end, it sacrifices the role of three other players for the experience of one, and that just doesn't last long."

There is a single-player mode, but it isn't fun, because the computer AIs are too stupid to be a challenge and the difficulty levels are too spread out. If the heroes take 50% less damage, you will still be able to beat them without a challenge. If they take 90% less damage, their effective hitpoint grow by 400%, whcih is too much of a jump and they are nearly impossible to kill.It's a real shame,  because it is a great concept and playing with friends was a blast."
