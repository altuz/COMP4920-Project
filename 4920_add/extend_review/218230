Its a TEAM game!5: No weapon is the same as the other, they each have their own Strength's!6: Black and gold weapons are EXACTLY the same as their standard variant! They also cost real money.7: Learn your Keybindings! It Helps Alot!8: Pick smaller fights untill your used to the gams mechanics!9: If you can see them you can kill them!10: Be RESPECTFUL!!! If you are, others will be more willing to help you! Dont be afraid to ask for help, EVERYONE needs help!These are the general tips/tricks/rules I live by! In any game!If your on faction VS (vanu) on server Emerald, My name is Quicky262Please, Have a good day and Have fun!2/18/2017 Edit: Some of my outfit/platoon mates gave me some ideas as to what to put for the 10 things as I could only think of about 4 on my own :PSo thanks to them to make this review entirely possible!3/1/2017 Edit 2: a few more tips for you are1) dont run infront of your allies that are shooting, go behind them so you stay out of their line of fire.2) use the terain around you for cover.3) if your a Heavy Assault turn you shield on when entering cover, even if your not being shot at. reason is this is a CLIENT side game if you can see them, you can shoot them. so if your in cover they may still see you out of cover for a short time after because they havent recieved the info from you yet. so use the addage of ""I can see you, I can shoot you"" the same goes for the other players aswell4) Don't go straight for the enemy UNLESS you have several teamates with you. Try your BEST to FLANK the enemy. don't attack them head on. come at them from the sides, above, or even behind them, if one tactic dosen't work... Try something else. the fight is dynamic, just like you!  5) Finally, LEARN the strengths and weaknesses of your weapons, it WILL take time.P.S. Feel free to add my on steam or PS2 (ingame) the name i listed is my primary although if you want i can tell you the others via PM or steam chat.P.P.S. I added some tips my teamates and friends gave me. some others on Youtube, like Wrel (Dev) Nico101, Joshino, and others have also said some of these tips. If you want to know more about the game look them up on youtube Especially Wrel, as he's a developer. Nico101 I'd recoment to Older audiences, as there is some ""Humor"" that younger audiences may find offensive or dont understand. (he and his team swear a bit aswell) i do squad ops with them and its mostly moments of WTF?! and general fun. Joshino and Wrel are a great choice to see if you want to Learn more about the game, its mechanics and also for general info/guides for weapons or tactics.Now all this is simply my PERSONAL opinion, while i agree that some others may not agree with me, i hold my opinions of the game and the players in fair judgment.Also, if you have any ideas for tips/tricks/unspoken rules/etc. post them in the comments. I will add them to the list and give you credit. feel free do discuss this game in comments below. Happy Gaming everyone!"

A war.Well yea mostly everything has a downside. Challenge, outsmart, tactics.One faction population decrease, the faction can be outnumbered. A swarm. Depending on server, can happen often.Limited numbers, sometimes queues to one world. At least playing underpopulated faction kinda prevents you from queues. Membership has priority.#Honorable mentions#CPU demanding (average GPU is enough).Dont expect 120+++ FPS, stable FPSBeside ingame, you can edit config file for performance, visual clarity, FOV, etc.Stuck in queue? Just try reenter the queue or ""Join Combat"" button every 1-2mins, should help."

,Recommended,218230,29952487,Posted: 15 February,all,KT_Extinction,"I think anyone who likes multiplayer FPS games should at the very least try out Planetside 2. This is a very special experience, I can’t think of another FPS that is as ambitious, varied, and outrageous in its dedication to all out chaotic war as this game. Thousands, and I mean thousands of real people at sitting at their computers all across the world battle in this never ending sci fi conflict from a first person perspective, all in glorious real time, and for the most part, it works. It’s astonishing to stare across a field at a giant group of advancing enemy infantry, easily larger than even the largest Battlefield server, snap to iron sights, and fire into the group and score a kill, only to get run over from behind by one of a hundred tanks cresting over the hill, firing in all directions like maniacs. The game is an MMO, but just the very fact that it still manages to feel like a standard FPS with decent controls and shooting mechanics is a grand achievement. Planetside 2 feels, at times, like the perfect game I wanted as a little kid while going “pew pew” with dozens of little plastic army men.Like other MMOs, you can join an outfit (guild) and fight for one of three distinct factions. The scary red space communists (guns are weak but shoot fast), the freedom loving space Americans (guns are strong but shoot slow), and the spiritual xenophile space hippies (laser guns). These factions are engaged in an eternal conflict over several continents, and the game centers around various control points. Choose a class ranging from the vital medic to the jetpacking Light Assault and help out your team crush the enemy forces. The size of each continent is mind boggling, and while large stretches are usually unused for long periods of time, it is easy to find conflict zones and jump straight in by the game’s intuitive map system. See all of those flashing booms?♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s going down there, get in the meat grinder, soldier!The land and air vehicles are easy to operate, and the infantry controls are familiar if you’ve played any recent FPS. There is a ton of variety in how the gameplay unfolds. One minute you are firing at distant targets in a barren desert from a tank’s turret, the next you could be dropped from a hovering Galaxy troop carrier into the thick of an intense CQB firefight. However, there are definitely long boring stretches of inactivity like in other MMOs, boring car rides or endless sprints to the objective that can become pretty grating over time. Thankfully, you can always kill yourself to respawn somewhere closer, or spawn on a mobile spawn truck known as the Sunderer, so if you’re an impatient type action is never too far away.The game unfortunately isn’t perfect. Performance is all over the place, despite having a good system expect things to slow down in some of the more hectic combat moments, which is expected since the game is trying to render hundreds of people shooting each other. The F2P system isn’t too bad, the starting guns are definitely viable in combat, but in order to get another weapon or even to unlock a new attachment can feel very grindy at times. Players who spend a ton of money will definitely have an advantage over you in a 1v1 situation since they have access to more gadgets, scopes, etc. than you do, but since the battles are so chaotic and packed with people, this is rarely an issue.Planetside 2 is an ambitious game that truly makes you feel like you are a small cog in a giant sci fi battle. I feel as if many multiplayer FPS games are becoming more and more obsessed with making every player feel like a cool guy special forces operator, but Planetside 2 basically says, “You don’t matter, you’re one of hundreds of dumb grunts running around and you are most likely going to die real quick.” I really enjoy this and I wished more developers would work towards making a similar MMOFPS like this of our dreams. Imagine an MMOFPS set in Europe during WW2 (Not that Heroes and Generals ♥♥♥♥♥), now that would be something I really like. Imagine Allied forces landing in player controlled LCVPs, while Axis Luftwafe strafe the beaches, and Panzer divisions massing for a counter attack. Now THAT's my dream video game.Planetside 2 is definitely worth trying out, it’s free, so why not?"

76561197976597821,Recommended,218230,29949275,Posted: 15 February,all,[S+S][DANK]Nuggz,"This is one of the most difficult FPS games I've ever played simply because of the sheer number or people who can end up shooting at you because of the smallest mistakes... This game puts the OP in ""Teamwork OP"" because a well oiled outfit that has its tactics down can storm a base and turn the tide of a battle even when outnumbered. This game is not pay 2 win but it WILL require you to grind to acquire the gear you want if you're not interested in investing some money for DB cash. There are many class unlocks that cannot be bought and must be earned.At this point of the game (like 4 years running now) there are many vets on both sides with lots of gear/weapons unlocked and it can seem daunting for a new player. However the unlockable weapons tend to be sidegrades rather than an outright upgrade, meaning that the stats of the new weapon won't necessarily be better than the last but it may be better for different circumstances i.e. CQC, or Long/mid range fights. Each weapon excels in its own area.I Believe there is even an xp bonus for soldiers under BR (Battle Rank) 15 to help you get some quick Cert points. I suggest medic for new players as you can earn a TON of xp without having to kill anyone and medics are SUPER useful in big or small fights."

,Recommended,218230,17686078,"Posted: 23 August, 2015",all,Take it easy!~,"Planetside 2 is a truly great game. The pay model is very fair as all weapons are mainly sidegrades (although I would say that some are better in general than others) and even when unsubbed it won't take long at all to unlock the weapons you're after. PS2 also offers fights to a scale which is unseen in other games; there's nothing quite like a hundred man battle full of tanks or fighters, when someone shoots down an aircraft you can be sure that someone elsewhere will probably be crushed to death by the scrap of it when it falls out of the sky.That said, my only major gripe of the game is the class balance; some classes are objectively more useful than others and the developers seem completely uninterested in balancing the game. With that in mind, I give it a solid 8/10."

There are over 30 spandex cultists on the other side of hill. Equipped as a light assault, you use that jetpack to good use, taking out 5 vanu scum with c-4 and mowing the rest down with your carbine.What really happens: You spawn in from the sundy, and see a bunch of bullets whizzing past and your screen is shaking from explosions. The vanu decided to zerg you with either 20 magriders, or a ♥♥♥♥♥torm of ESFs and liberators. Within 10 seconds, that precious van that you spawned out of is know a burning frame. You decide to take cover behind the wreckage but then a green glow engulfs it, eventually leaving no trace of evidence that anything happened.

Some cheaters, though quite an active, pro-merit, anti-cheat community in-game. The much overhyped Russian 3erg (Zerg) isn't as bad as claimed (played TR, VS and NC). Team-killing major problem in some factions (imbeciles and griefers). PS2 always reads the bug list and there are a number of aftermarket forums about cheats, bugs, tricks and tips. Designed more of a squad game with a number of friends than an individual. Daybreak better than most companies- not perfect- but far better than EA or Ubisoft. Grinding isn't too difficult. Everything bar cosmetics are obtainable through Certs- in game grind credits. You'll soon learn your individual playing style and dictatig how you engage make the difference, not purchased weapons or mods. Good stock weapons, many veterans able to score evry highly on them.

,Recommended,218230,29793361,Posted: 8 February,all,antiksbro,"I fell in love with this game, but it took time. At first this game seems overly complicated. However it does get better, by better I mean amazing.I've only ever played as Vanu so I'm biased but you can pick from two other unique factions. Each faction has strength and weaknesses. When you first log in you get a basic run down of the pros of that faction , so there is help in that regard.The customization is great, and you get six or seven player types (medic, infiltrator, etc) plus several ground and air vehicles to choose from (all can be customized). Plus your faction pays you certs every min so you can load out in a vehicle or Max about every 5 mins.The game looks amazing and the immersion is excellent. From the sound of crickets at night to the roar of aircraft overhead, this game gets intense.Speaking of intense, the battles (good battles) can be down right nerve wrecking. Hundreds of fighters, tanks moving across the battle zone air craft raining bombs and bullets flashes of rounds from every direction, it can leave you exhausted after two or three long sessions.The game is also good about giving you good starter weapons. You earn certs for upgrades by kills, controlling points, overtaking bases etc. as you earn these certs (different from pay you get from your faction for vehicles and maxes) you can upgrade abilities, weapons. You can customize your character to excel at different things. Maybe you want to focus on taking out enemy vehicles, or you want to mow down hoards of other enemy - you choose...In my opinion this is the best mmo/fps out. Nothing compares to the massive maps (four or five continents) with snow, jungle, desert, and a multitude of bases. The mount of weapon and character customization options. The ranking system is fun and keeps you going, along with rankings and ribbons, and xp... Also it's free!!! I still can't believe it's free.So it took time but I love this game and have stopped playing anything else. This is however not a perfect game. There are log-on issues occasionally, glitches (after I play as a Max and go back to infiltrator my infiltrator no longer cloaks) but overall it is 100% worth the investment of time. Also spend time on watching videos about how to play. YouTube or in your player load-out screen they have basic training tutorials. So get out there, have fun and play with friends or just join a squad and work together ( this is key)."

My wife tried to run it on her, pretty decently equipped, laptop and the house nearly burnt down.Pros:Fun FPS combat with huge open world battles and all types of vehicles.Cons:Low population a lot of the time; most likely due to the hardware requirements. I have 2x SLi 1080's and even I sometimes will drop below 60fps randomly. I cant imagine how someone on a medium-tier PC would run.Tons of microtransactions. I don't usually care about it but I feel like everything in the game has a price attached to it, kind of brings me out of the immersion."
,Not Recommended,218230,29645029,Posted: 2 February,all,Shiro,Was really hooked and addicted. However with DB owning it now it has slowly been going downhill and customer support seems to lack care for their customers/players (2 experiences of this so far). They also have done stuff such as ruining thermal vision. It got revamped/removed and no longer shows infantry. Instead it has been turned into a useless junk vision to spot vehicles easier!?!? It was always easy to spot vehicles to begin with. Sorry DB but your slowly trashing the game.P.S. Check my play hours that should tell you something. Characters on all 3 factions to.=============Edit: I still can't quit playing this game is crack do yourself a favor and don't start unless you wan't to lose many days of your life >.<

,Recommended,218230,29794498,Posted: 8 February,all,Fawkes,"This is a fast paced game to the fullest. One minute you'll be riding your flash, and next thing you know an Infiltrator picks you off or a tank blows you to bits.I absolutely love it, but let me tell you one thing. NEVER run solo. This game can be overwhelming to lone wolves and new players. There are no spawn limits, so you might end up in a war zone with dozens of players, vehicles, and aircrafts swarming around you and you WILL die, no doubt about it. Yes, the graphics are a bit dated but that is ok, they need to be. There are multiple areas with over 2k players and it can bog even the best of systems down.Pros:- Multiple classes that stick to their purposes- There is always action to jump into- TONS of enemies to kill- Buildable Platoon bases (completely destructable aswell)- plenty of vehicles or aircrafts to ride in- AMAZING dogfights-Gives you a pretty good idea of what war used to look like (WW2 for instance)Cons:- Sometimes to many people for some new players- REALLY easy to die (can be considered a Pro aswell)- Pay to Win (Better guns you otherwise couldn't get)- Hard to keep good vantage points- Platoon leaders tend to be easy to upset (at least from my experience)I highly recommend this to any veteran or beginner FPS players as it works your reaction timing, distance judgement, and aim a lot more than other games.I rate it 9.85/10 Would play again"

,Recommended,218230,29774020,Posted: 7 February,all,Fighter5345,"Planetside is a great game, but it's dying. Planetside desprately needs new players to stay up and running. It may not be the most graphically stunning or on par with more modern FPS open battlefield shooters but it has it's own flavour with its varying fights. Although people whine and complain about P2W because it\s a F2P game thats not true, all weapons are to be used in their own way and Environment. Cross faction balancing is pretty good, seems one faction has better weapons? They really don't, theres always a downfall between factions.The NC are hard hitting and close quarters, weapons with a high damage but low rate of fire is their specialty. At distance they are weak but if they get close they hit like a truck. One MAX unit with dual shotguns can quickly make way for allied units behind it and clear out the most clustered of areas.The TR are fist firing and large ammo capacity, their weapons fire faster and need to reload less, at medium range with controled fire these guys can easily become the lead flinging harbingers of death. One heavy can easily clear a room of unexpecting enemies in one long spray of fire.The VS are fast reload and no bullet drop (Damage drops at range still), Their bullets travel straight so no need to compensate for drop and coupled with a fast reload to get that last needed round downrange, Watch out for Vanu snipers, they can easily drop a man from long distance without the need to take extra time to gauge how high they need to aim.I've been on every faction and have heard the many complaints about other faction weapons being too overpowered, or their weapons too underpowered. They are just not using their weapons properly or don't know how to control them. Same with faction specific vehicles like Light Aircraft and Heavy Tanks.Planetside is a good game to try and very fun to get into when you learn the game mechanics of bullet drop, bullet travel, Nanites, Weapon Effectiveness, and squad strategy. The devs were even nice enough to throw in koltyr which is a place ONLY NEW PLAYERS BELOW RANK 15 CAN ENTER! That means no high level players with multuple characters to make you feel unsuperior. I have had no expearince on Koltyr so I cannot tell you if there are hackers but I know I have yet to come across a hacker in the main planetside contenents in a very long time, just the occasional salty player who decides he wants to say all the swear words and racist slurs he just learned yesterday.The planetside community is still active, we just need new players to liven up the servers a bit more. Most of us are willing to help and there are plenty of open outfits for you to join. A lone wolf does not hunt as effectively as a pack."

I would like to recommend watching the youtube channels by Wrel (a dev of the game) and other players to see what it's like.Even though bugs are be getting more common, you will only start to notice them after a few hundred hours of game play.The game has frequent updates where they tweak weapon stats, add new skins and features.

This results in one faction having more than double the population of the other two factions. The Dev's could stop this if they tried, but it won't happen.- THIS GAME IS PAY TO WIN! I don't care who you are or where you're from, if you look through the mechanics in this game (like the stat booster system) it becomes painfully obvious that this game was built to favour those with disposable income. It used to be a case of ""Grind for months to get a new weapon, or you can pay a ridiculous amount of real money to get it now"", but since the booster system, it's been about ""Your enemy is using boosts, if you want to level the field, buy boosts with real money.""Overall:-----------------------------------------------I have many fond memories in this game. I've been in hellish firefights, I've lead ghost capping runs, I've crashed so many jets, and I seem to have a bad habit of driving my Sunderers into enemy lines... >_<Is this the same game it was back then? Not even close. Gaining in-game currency has always been horribly slow, but when you focused on the combat and the tactics, it became less of an issue. The game's fun comes from riding as the gun turret of your squadmate's vehicle, watching for jets and tanks as the driver hits a rock and flips the d*mn thing for the third time this session.When the Dev's (Who were Sony Online Entertainment at the time) kept putting in more and more PTW elements, the combat became more and more one-sided. (Seriously, I've gone from a 6/1 K/D, to a 10/22, with the same character.) Between the imbalances already in the game and the constant 4th Faction ""Zerg"", when they put in the boost system, the game lost a huge portion of its playerbase. Which means Platoons have vanished, +200 firefights are rare (used to find one every couple days.) and now the game is mainly just the 4th Faction rolling around the map.Sony has since sold the game to a new company (presumably because of the huge population drop), and sadly the new Dev's don't seem to have done anything to fix the game. I stopped playing about a year or so ago, but when I came back in to check nothing felt different to when I quit. (K/D's about the same too)Can I recommend this game? No. This is a rotting shell of what it used to be, yet another fatality of Capitalism.I'm going to go play something else and leave what's left of this once-beautiful game to die. RIP."

You're welcome for an actual recipe, not a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ copy and paste pie recipe. Trust me nothing goes wrong with nutella.INGREDIENTS:1 c. unsalted butter2 c. sugar1/2 tsp. salt1 c. flour1 c. cocoa powder4 eggs1 (13-oz.) jar Nutella5 Ferrero Rocher candies, unwrapped and crumbledDIRECTIONS:1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.2. Melt butter in a medium-sized saucepan over medium heat. Add sugar, stirring until combined. 3. Remove from heat and add salt, flour, and cocoa powder, stirring to combine. Whisk in eggs, stirring just until the mixture is combined into a batter. Set aside.4. Spray an 8""-x-8"" pan with cooking spray. Pour half of the batter into the pan. Spoon or lightly drizzle most of the Nutella on top of the batter, forming an even layer over the brownie batter. 5. 5. Use a spoon or silicone spatula to cover the Nutella with the remaining brownie batter. (If you pour the batter straight on top of the Nutella, it will sink into the Nutella and combine into one marbled—yet delicious—mess.)6. Bake until the top layer of brownies has browned and set, 28 to 30 minutes. It shouldn’t jiggle when you remove it from the oven. (The toothpick test doesn’t work here, since the toothpick will hit the Nutella layer, making the brownies seem uncooked.)7. Let cool for 15 to 20 minutes, then top with a drizzle of Nutella and crumbled Ferrero Rocher chocolates. Cut into squares and serve.Credits: ★ Billy"

The weapons and armor are insanely unbalance to favor those who pay to buy cash only weapons and unlock all five levels of your nano armor with cash. Recent updates added OP weapons that are cash only. You have literal neckbeards who live in their basement playing this game all day long and ruining the game for others. People who played this game know who I am talking about. Grinding to get your weapons will take you at least 2 weeks at best but at least a month for one good weapon or a few suit upgrades.

It was never really explained despite the game having a huge unskippable tutorial! Also, why allow friendly fire if you punish people for doing it? Why not just leave it out?

,Not Recommended,218230,29541712,Posted: 28 January,all,Hylomane,"Pros:==============-The best F2P MMOFPS-Not pay to win. Tactics and positioning reign supreme. You can pretty much predict how a battle will end based on the terrain and numbers. All starting weapons are decent (except for vehicles).-Fun, easy to join communities-Air, Ground and Infantry on the same map-Massive maps with hundreds of players, no loading zones-So many unlocks, you will never get them allCons:===============-What's up with repairing in this game? It takes many shots to destroy vehicles and combined with powerful repair tools this leads to long, drawn out and just plain stupid standoffs where you are literally standing there and holding the mouse button down for minutes on end. You do this because it's necessary, but it's not fun for either the repairer or the shooter. I've sat with my teammates repairing our landed gunship while a fighter ran out of ammo trying to kill us.-Long Time To Kill anything. It takes many bullets to kill infantry, similar to Halo. This leaves  you feeling unsatisfied after enemies get away from you time and time agian even after the element of surprise is on your side. This is true for vehicles as well. This also tends to make the game more ""tanky"" and what I mean by that is that whoever has the most health, be it infantry or vehicle will generally win.-Bait and switch business model. You spend your time/money on perfecting a play-style or vehicle loadout and then the devs nerf the **** out of it, completely breaking it. They don't give refunds, so you're forced to buy something else or **** off. They do this because new players get rolled by vets that picked a play style and perfected it. In other words, it punishes long term players to keep short term players. It doesn't take a genius to predict how this will end..-Occasional cheaters, not a big problem though-MAJOR performance issues have plagued the game ever since the beginning. The engine is slow and buggy, and another game by the same developer failed due to this problem. That game was H1Z1.-Updates are frequent, but every update slows the game down even more. You will need a top of the line PC at all times if you want to play this game. Right now, you need 16GB RAM, i5 or i7 with high clock speeds (3Ghz+) and a good video card. Next year you will buy a new PC or turn down your settings because this game will demand even more.-The game needs to keep vets onboard, because they are the bread and butter of the communities. They run outfits, which make the game much more fun. Air drops aren't possible without organization. Unfortunately most have left after waves and waves of nerfs. The devs have made it clear through their actions that they don't value long term players and the game has suffered because of it.Conclusion:===========It's a love hate relationship. I love it because there is nothing like it. I frequently think of reinstalling again after my last rage-uninstall. But then I don't because... I hate it because it keeps changing, sometimes backwards, sideways, but always more laggy.  I can't keep buying a new PC all the time. My PC runs 90% of the games available on Steam, and I won't drop $800 to play a free game. Also, not as obvious but a huge impact on the game is that vets have left the game a long time ago, something that makes me sad. The best times I've had were with experienced people that lead squads and used voice chat. Now there is hardly anyone because they all got burned out. Most YouTubers have stopped covering the game, aside from Wrel, a YouTuber/developer that only plays infantry, driving most of the recent nerfs to vehicles and air. I think he wants to turn this game into Call of Duty.Still, Planetside 2 lives on because it sits uncontested in a niche. As soon as a competitor pops up without the performance issues, this game will finally be laid to rest, and not a moment too soon if you ask me."

,Recommended,218230,30225463,Posted: 27 February,all,Asvarduil,"Note - I play primarily on PS4.  My actual time playing PS2 is more in the 120-150 hr. range.  As I currently play on PS4 more than PC, my review does not discuss some mechanics present in the PC version.Once upon a time, gas-mask mooks took over the world.  The good news is, they were nice gas-mask mooks, and so created a benevolent Terran Republic that set out to colonize the stars.  They found a funky planet with wonder materials, but their wormhole was recognized by God as being a physics bug with the universe, so He patched it out.  Two factions split off, and thanks to the power of nanomachines, neglectful alien precursors, and someone liking Battlefield 3 a bit too much, we now have a forever-war that you get to play in.Planetside 2 is a MMOFPS for both PC and PlayStation 4.  You can haveabsolutely friggin' massivebattles, in real time, with strategic elements in positioning, loadout, and what hexes your Empire controls on the map.  There's three Empires - TR (Terran Republic), NC (New Conglomerate, think United Space of 'Murica!), and VS (Vanu Sovereignty, AKA ""The Purple People Eaters"", ""We Love Spandex"", and ""Scientologists with Halo Plasma weapons"").In this review, as usual, I'm going to discussWhat Works,What Doesn't Work, and ultimately theTL;DRfor this title.What WorksFirst, the business model.This is easily the best free-to-play game on the market right now, bar none.It's not pay to win in any appreciable capacity - paying just lets you progress more quickly, but even then, not in all areas, or in general.  You start the game with the most versatile weapons for your faction - some call them the best, but as you'll quickly discover, all weapons in this game are sidegrades that fulfill different roles, and can be customized to work differently.  There's many possible camoflage options you can buy to make a loadout unique.On a related note, this game is highly skill based, in a good way.  If you die, you did not do something right (or your spawn room is getting camped, that does happen from time to time.)  The main mechanics of the game are standard staples of FPSes, and modern infantry combat in general - headshots, choosing good positions to fire from, using cover, flanking opponents.  Even if you have more money than sense and buyeveryupgrade you possibly can, if you can't use them effectively, a BR 1 noob can - and very well might - headshot you into a quick rank-up.If you're not a seasoned FPS player, the game's structure has you covered: this is a MMOFPS.  You're not the only soldier on the battlefields of Auraxis.  You can earn XP through non-combat means (healing, fixing devices and vehicles, having squadmates spawn on vehicles, spotting enemies, the list goes on.)Lastly, in its own, odd, frustrating, butt-clenching way...this game isjust plain fun.I usually avoid nebulous terms like fun, in pursuit of things like discussion of actual mechanics, or cool technical features, or whatever.  I just can't understate that I find this game fun in general, though.  There's always something to learn and improve on.  I can always experiment with loadouts.  I can do troll-y things to amuse myself, at my opponent's expense - my favorite thing is running into a room as an Engineer, with the room full of enemies, drop an ammo pack for them to confuse them, then pull my shotgun and going to town.  It doesn't always work, but you can practicallyfeelthe stunned faces on the opposing players.What Doesn't WorkIf you have a weak system, I'd suggest getting a PS4 and playing on that instead, if that's an option.  Despite being 5 years old now, this game has difficulty running on my factory HP 500-217c.  You can drop the graphics to squeeze out better framerates, but with this game, you absolutely need reliable framerates for sharpshooting (a key mechanic).  If your system isn't up to spec, you'd be well-advised to pass.Speaking of mechanics, this game doesn't teach them well at all.  The VR Room is a pre-purchase place to test weapons - it provides no training to speak of for the concepts you need to master to be competent.  On PC there is a tutorial for a fresh install, and it's woefully inadequate.  Part of the frustration with this game is that it does a crappy job of preparing you for the challenges you will face.  To resolve this, the developers need toreallyconsider the skills they require of their players, and devise better training and VR scenarios to help players exercise those skills, so that a newer player can provide a better challenge to their more seasoned counterparts.Also on the subject of lack of information, let's talk weapons.  The information about weapons is highly technical, and nearly useless.  There's a YouTube channel for a person who was inducted to the PS2 development team,YouTube Link: Wrel, who has a great series of Weapon Reviews.  Unfortunately, if you want easy to understand information about weapons, you need to watch those, as the weapon details in the game are impenetrable graphs and stats, that miss critical pieces of information (recoil pattern?  Is it a full-auto, burst, or semi-auto weapons?  Relative to other weapons, how powerful is it?  What's the role of the unmodified weapon?)  I have to penalize the game on this count for the reason - and try to follow on this one - that if you don't include something in the game, and it's something I need to know, then you have made it harder for me to play or to get better.  To fix this, I recommend keeping the advanced notation of weapon traits, but also having the simple 'need to know' traits presented first, with the advanced details being able to be seen if needed.The map design has problems.  It's very easy to get in a 'blitz-blockade' situation, where - upon losing a fight - you respawn at a base that is already under capture, with the spawn room (and the outlet where the teleporter leads) being already under blockade.  This is exacerbated by the fact that infantry has very limited ability to deal with armor, as far as I'm aware.  Put differently?  Armor is king; getting to an armor terminal is king.  To counter this problem, infantry needs tools to better deal with armor; additionally, bases need to be much harder to spawn-camp than they currently are.Lastly, this game has serious morale problem.  People do play this game, and have lively battles, but if you listen to the Wrel channel above, or others, veterans of the game say that this game is flagging.  That's not to say 'Silence the critics!'  That's to say, you need to make this game noob-friendlier if you want to improve morale.  Being a MMOFPS, if the first M isn't true, the experience will suffer, and if the quality of the noobs isn't helped, it's not going to lead to good, memorable fights.The TL;DRThis game is an unquestionableRecommended.It's probably the only running MMOFPS, but it does what it does well, though not without issues.  The community is a good one, but is suffering because the game just doesn't help newcomers do what is being asked of them.  The monetization system isveryfair, and I think should be the gold standard of how to do microtransactions (contrast with Star Trek Online, the polar opposite.)If your system can support this game, and if you can endure B.S. deaths, and if you don't mind watching YouTube because of poor/useless tutorials and training, then this game is totally for you.  Even if you can't endure those things, this game might well still be for you.  It's free, so give it a shot, I think you'll be impressed."

I made an account a couple of years back and tried it on a friends computer but didn't have the specs on my own to continue (I know that's pretty sad).And frankly, I am very glad that I rediscovered this game! It doesn't have the ""arena-batlle"" feel that most online FPS games have, which I personally find to be very positive. You are a soldier in a futuristic sci-fi setting on very large maps and are participating in not just a battle but a war! Just remember one thing... you will die and you will die very often. Don't let that get you down.As I am quite unexperienced in FPS games I think it is a very good testimony to the game when I say I'm having fun playing this despite having a K/D of around 0.15... Yeah I know I'm a noob :DAnother few positive aspects are:- I'ts free! Who doesn't love great free games?! I may or may not consider buying a temporary membership sometime justto throw some money in the devs' faces to let them know I like their game.- 6 soldier classes with special abilities. Have to get used to that fact that the abilities can be used very frequently!- Lots of customization. You can choose between many upgrades in almost all apects of the game.- Surprisingly large variety of vehicles that play a big part in the wars. Very fun to share vehicles with your squad.- Starting weapons are good and it is very possible to compete with players that have better equipment. So I wouldn't sayit's P2W- Last but not least: a very friendly community. It is after all, a game built on teamwork.As of now, I can't really complain about anything because the only thing that sucks about this game is my lacking skill but I'm working on it ;)So I definitely recommend this game.

You need to check your corners constantly. The fights are usually however on the same chokepoints all the time so sometimes it will make you feel like a grind.When I play against 10-20 enemies I am getting a 2 K/D ratio, when against 40-60 enemies, I am getting rekt and K/D is around 1 or below despite being an old veteran to the FPS genre.It is I believe the best F2P game I've played, but it's frustrating as well, as it's hard to master.

,Recommended,218230,30074640,Posted: 21 February,all,samitheberber,"After the amount of hours I have spent in the game, I feel legit to give an honest review about it. I had FPS experience before I started to play PS2, mostly just casual gaming with various titles from the genre. Sadly I got spoiled too much of the scale that it is difficult to go back on those. The only reason I will play other FPS games too is to have more competitive and very controlled environment to try out own reaction times and skills in well known titles.If you are expecting very polished and smooth experience with always balanced and fun fights, then PS2 might not be for you. There has been ups and downs during the game's life time, but dev team has done their best to keep the players satisfied.At this point I want to say that put the game already to download, because it takes a while, unless you have limited data plan or small storage. Otherwise there is no reason to try out, except if you are easily addicted or do have unsupported operating system. Some of the older computers will have performance issues, but my oldish rig is doing fine with competitive performance.What can you expect from the game:You will die, many times, all the time.There are people who have been playing this game since beta and they know every minor detail of their favourite weapons and good locations to kill you. But don't worry, there are also same people in your team, who will probably save you before you get in danger zone.Game has cross faction textual chat for the area you are fighting, so expect to see people cursing how sad other team is by bringing too many players in the fight to break the population balance.Some people don't have legs so they just sit in their vehicles all the time and try to shoot infantry with easy to kill cannons if they aren't in real danger.Maps are quite huge, but usually the killer is hiding nearby even when the shot comes out of nowhere.According the chat many people have RTS background, specially from StarCraft and from zerg faction.You can play alone or be part of a squad of 12 players, which can be part of platoon of four squads, which can be part of some outfit public operations to run multiple platoons. Depending the situations you are alone or there are 96+ friendlies with you in same fight.There are no matchmaking or any custom game etc. You are in your character in one of the five servers, in one of the four continents (not counting Koltyr the new player training ""continent""), in one of the many bases. There will or won't be enemies or friendlies, but you have all the right be in there.It is very confusing at the first, because shots coming from all over the place or from nowhere. There is an in-game map, which you can use to navigate in the fights (think as joining a match).You can get all the stuff with the in-game currency you get by playing the game. Only the swag and character vanity are restricted to DBC, which you get only with real money.Weapons are ""sidegrades"" so that they specialize in certain roles, like gaining firerate by losing damage, etc.You might get fully upgraded vehicles with swag from veteran players if you ask kindly.There is no Pay-to-win, but you can buy XP boosts and premium membership to get more value out of your in-game actions, which will make your cert (in-game currency) gain faster. Also paying players might have squad boosts, which will affect to other players in the group, so F2P players can get extra XP boost without paying.There are three different factions, that have different style of weaponry. For new players some might be easier to start with, because more controllable, but over the time it is just personal preference which backstory you want to support. Spandex babes, teamkilling blueberries or oppressive internationalists.Community can send own cosmetic creation to player studio to get them in game.There is no PC-PS4 realm, so can't show the PC master race dominion to console plebs.

The form of ""Instant Action"" play that drops you in the heat of battle makes it quite fun solo, but also nominates you a ""blueberry"".  This simply means that solo players tend to be harder to work with when it comes to strategy, but the community generally finds a way to handle this.  Another note:  This game is not for the faint of heart or faint of hardware.  This game, in order to have the best chances of fun and success, requires some $$$.

From the old SOE days to now DayBreak, PS2 has changed somewhat substantially. There has been good and bad with every update and I should know; I admit I have a founder account and even played in the Alpha and Beta. This game has slowly and lethargically evolved over the years. While there are many that show disdain for the DayBreak I do not find them to be that horrid. Sure it feels somedays that the server population for Emerald isn't what it used to be (Remember when Emerald wasn't a thing and there were about three other servers/player account that got merged into it, I do.) but that does not mean that the game is dying, I keep running into new players every time I log in. Many of them are great and many are little sniveling CoD kids. The main draws of this game are and will forever be:-Massive maps-Massive fights-Coordination/Teamwork-Forward Operating Base/ HIVE buildingI hope that this game will last for many more years as there really isn't anything else like it right now. I give the game a rating of 8/10, it's solid and I have stuck with it but there are still some old issues from the SOE days that were never addressed."

Planetside 2 though is, well, I can't describe it in one word.it uses a combination of client side and server side netcode which gives people with a high ping an advantage, it's widely fluctuating population creates this zerg environment where nobody has a good time because one side is stuck in the spawn room for five mnutes, and while as a rule I try to blame myself for unfavorable results, a lot of weird♥♥♥♥♥♥goes on. I attribute it to the netcode but just sometimes I can't even rationalize it that way. Maybe it's my lack of knowledge on the game, maybe I'm just being a whiny ♥♥♥♥♥, I dunno but either way it kills my enjoyment.BUT;It's a game with a high skill ceiling in regards to mastery of the minimap and the spotting system. If you like futuristic Battlefield 2142 styled warfare this game is amazing. Just remember to stop firing your weapon after a few shots because the game uses cone of fire, not recoil.  Definitely worth a try, this was among the first generation of games built for free to play so even though the cut corners are obvious it still carries a level of quality synonymous with pay to play games. Even if Sony is a♥♥♥♥♥♥company. If you ask me about the biggest mistake DBG has made it would be that they fired everybody who worked on the game and replaced them with people who don't know what the ♥♥♥♥ they're doing, while simultaneously replacing the design lead with a long time player with time and money already invested into the game, leading to some poor development decisions.Still worth a try though, although tbh if I didn't have the Filthy Frank soundpack for Recursion I'd probably uninstall."
,Recommended,218230,29821578,Posted: 10 February,all,JohnyMuffinYT,"Planetside 2Planetside 2 is an amazing game though has sadly lost most of its population over the 4 or so years it has been out, finding a large-scale battle on for example the Australian server is a joke, or not relevant the ps4 servers as well. If you’re willing to join on of the American servers, you will experience something totally different and amazing. Planetside 2 sucks when playing lone wolf but once you get into a large platoon that can hold over 100 people you can have tones of fun, Doing things from Max raids to Para Drops. Also, Planetsides 2 base building system also adds something amazing for the players wanting to play on the defensive. When starting planetside 2 getting certs is the biggest problem, though once you get use to the game and join a platoon saving up certs is easy, my balance is currently 1600 certs.  A big problem I have with Planetside 2 that I find is the rarity in the Implant batteries making them almost borderline impossible to use all the time. After you pass all these problems, Planetside 2 is an amazing experience that I don’t think can be had in battlefield or call of duty. If you have the time, download planetside 2. It’s a must have free steam game and everyone should at least try it."
76561198344284190,Recommended,218230,29828046,Posted: 10 February,all,[THoA] Brother Marxus,"Ive been playing for a couple of years now (on ps4 and pc) i got to quite a high level on ps4 as vanu but i have only played a couple of hours on pc because i brought other games and got addicted to them for months. I recently had to restore my computer so iam gonna install it again right now and start playing again. Absolutely worth downloading it has everything you would want from a shooter and more. 3 empires fighting it out in one huge continent (huge ♥♥♥♥ing maps, not your call of duty or battlefield ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t), Different terrains that suit different playstyles for example if you like playing pilot dont play on Hossin because its a dense jungle and you cant see infantry for♥♥♥♥♥♥ Hossin is more for infantry. Its pretty good for inflitrator because you can use the trees and stuff for cover. It has Exellent weapon customization and really gives you a veriety to choose from once you have enough certs (in game currency). By Level 10 you should have at least 1000 certs and that can get you one of the best weapons. Say for example you like playing inflitrator, by level 10 you can spend your 1k certs on the most powerful sniper for whatever faction you are playing as (each faction has different weapons with different capabilities). Each faction has different vehicles also. Last time i played there was atleast 500 players in the game and it was ♥♥♥♥ing mental. Its one of those games that just keeps on going. Huge attacks and defences, massive firefights, and just an all around great fps. one of the greatest i have ever played actually. idk if this happens on pc much because like i say, only having a few hours on record, but on ps4 there were a decent amount of team killers. They werent everywhere but they were numerous. In all the time i played on ps4 quite a few tried to purposely team kill me, some succeeded, but on pc it only happened once and it was an accident because he said sorry. So if you like a good firefight and you like big maps with many ways to play and contribute toward your empire, go and download it right now. start of in koltyr (the noob area, you are forced out at level 15 and cant go back) then when you are level 15 go and join everybody in one of the four massive continents and prepare to fight with and against hundreds if not thousands of people at a time. you can go to any continent at any level at any time as long as one of the opposing factions hasnt won and locked it down but it is better to start of in koltyr because it is smaller and there will be people of roughly the same level as you and you can gank some easy kills. (hossin, amerish, Esamir and indar are where the big boys play). Download, play and enjoy is all i can really say. If anyone Team kills you, i can assure you that he or she will get their comeuppance. Everybody is generally nice and play as a team really well. Every game has their knob heads, but on pc, i havent found any yet. just on ps4. You can also purchase helmets and cosmetics for vehicles and camos for your weapon or character using Daybreak cash or DBC (in game currency brought with real life money). But that is just cosmetics, The wapons and attachments are all obtainable in game with certs. (on ps4, by level 20 i had a damn good loudout, never spent a dime). And the vehicles are unlocked through levelling and you can use your spawn tokens to spawn them, the same as the max class (walking tank). These spawn tokens will recharge over time. So, there you have it, i could type more about the game but these are the basics, i dont have time to go into depth right now, i need to go play lol. Nothing bad i can think of apart from team killing noobs that i havent managed to find yet on pc but they will exist. Its a thumbs up from me and a solid 9/10 ( i would give it a 10 but the team killers drag that 1 percent down, ik its not the games fault but i refuse to lie). Like i said, havent found any on pc personally yet but i know they exist. But i gave the game a 9 because other than the team killing there is nothing bad i can think of right now. Its a really fun and addictive game and iam gonna get back into in and see what has been added since i last played. Gotta give credit where it is due and it is definitely due here."

This game currently holds the world record for most players in one battle online; at 2000 players. While you probably won't ever see anything like that, PS2 takes place over four large continents with many bases and outposts that your faction is trying to take from the other two.The environment and terrain give this game a lot of it's unique feel, and with factions all having different weapons, armour and vehicles, they all feel different and unique as well. Most of the battles you fight in, whether they're at a normal base, a player-made one, or just a meeting out in the open, will feel much more organic and realistic than they would if you were playing something like battlefield. Scale is everything, and with combined infantry, air and ground vehicle gameplay, PS2 feels huge.The game itself feels smooth and even the Australian/Oceanic server has enough players for large fights, but be warned; this game needs a pretty good CPU to process all the♥♥♥♥♥♥that's flying across your screen and all the other people, vehicles and particles in your area.Despite what people might say, this game is by no means p2w. The starting weapons you get for most factions/classes are some of the best general-purpose ones in the game; and while you can pay to unlock weapons with real money straight away, the game is pretty damn hard in the beginning and by the time you have a feel for the game and are ready for a new weapon, you will be able to get it. Most of the purchases you will make in PS2 are not weapons. Weapons have a very low impact on how well you actually do. What matters in this game is:1. Skill2. The upgrades you have made to your kit (Jetpacks for light assault, medi-tool for medic, cloak for infiltrator, etc.)Overall:Yeah sure its a good game i guess"

There is lots, if not tons of stuff that you can buy only with real money, which is dissapointing, you cannot customize your armor, color of armor or weapons, that you must buy. Yes i know its F2P game, naturally there will be stuff to buy for real money, but come on, almost everything.If there is more weapons we can have on start, and that we can customize stuff without paying that would be nice, this game is big enough for both free stuff and premium ones.Now to say about each thing in game:Weapons: You have large selection of Assault rifles, snipers, shotguns, machineguns, side arms(pistols), weapons can be customized, optics, grips..., you can even repaint them but you must pay for that, there is also cold weapons at least i saw knife.Vehicles: There is several ground and several air vehicles in this game. Like for the weapons, they can be customized with different weapon packs, which you need to unlock. You can even repaint them, but again you must payWhile ground vehicle controls are more or less good, moving is clunky. Air controls are terrible, at least to me, i crash every time, well maybe i didnt add controls right, however in these few hours i spend i only play once or twice with airIt is shame that there is no mechas, walkers, that would be interesting.Armor: several types for each of main classes but you must pay for them to unlock and customize them.There is serveral classes in game, light inf, heavy inf, medics, engineers, inflitrators (basicly snipers), each of them having its own good and bad points and each of them having its own equipment.Maps: well i cannot say anything bad about maps, they are huge, but there is huge amount of players, but even with large number of players some maps are pritty empty, i love smaller ones, but it become crowdy if all thre factions are present.General: I like this game, its fast, intense, i could say real war. However you will get♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥really fast, there is lots of campers, snipers that love sniping from a far with advance equipment while you that just start marching around with basic weaponary. (there is a weapon trial every 2h or so, i recommend you use it when in game, every weapon (or most of them) are capable to try, actually only one every 2 h.), that is not so bad.I didnt saw any cheater, that is good. But lack of classes or mods make differences. You are thrown into the fry from beginning, with beginners like yourself and with people who have hundreds of hours in it, advance armors, equipment, weapons, in 70% you stand no chance.This game have lots of good things and again lots of bad ones. I first try to play this game when it was released two years ago, my pc was crappy then and i couldnt play it. Now i can, but do i like the game. no, not in this state. Game works fine, there is very little or no lags. Ok sometimes there is, but there are servers, for all regions, so chose the one that is closest. If you are from EU chose EU, not NA or Asian, otherwise you will experience lots of lags.Game lacks in dedicated mods. Everything in this game is simply capture that, defend this. Take enough points and your team wins.You cannot chose teams. Your character belongs to one of three factions, since i didnt really bother to remember the names, simply Blue, Red or Purple. Each with its own differences and unique weapons and equipment and story. So faction you chose at beginning will be with you as long as you play or until you decide to make another character. I dont know if you can change character Factions, doesn't really matter.PlanetSide 2 have lots of players, so you would  never have problems with lack of players. and target:):), but game is rather difficult, you will die in it, a lot, but you will learn to play it if you really want to.Do i recommended it or not. It is shame that Steam didn't introduce neutral option for reviews, i guess they will one day.It would be unfair for me not to recommend t his game, and brag how its bad how it lack this, how it lack that, but if you like grinding, if you like fast pace shooters, with lots of people on maps, this is game for you, i personally wouldnt recommended this game, not in the current look. but il add yes for all those who actually like it. I play it simply for fun, as i didnt play shooters in years, but again, expect lots of hours in this game if you want to unlock something, and lots of money(real one) if you want better stuff."
