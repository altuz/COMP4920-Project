The problem is that the ai can multitask infinately but you are simply a mere human. There's only so many hundreds of tiny ships you can keep track of on screen at the same time. The skirmishes add a lot of replay along with the leveling up but, honestly, if you like this game save your money and get Eufloria instead. It's not as visually pleasing but it's a much better game, hands down."

It's a fun game when you are winning but fairly frustrating when you aren't, the reason this is, is not because the game is too hard but rather the game doesn't allow for much variety in strategies. You will restart over and over untill you find the one strategy that works. This makes it an unbalanced strategy game because you may as well watch a bot vs bot match on any RTS and pretend you are one of the bots. With that said, when you are winning it's quite enjoyable and would be a VERY decent game if this feeling was well maintained. If you find it on special it is likely worth whatever experience you get but I would not pay full price."

The first level of the game could be easy, but when you play deeper into the game, there's when the fun begin.The graphics of Planets Under Attack is cartoon, but that doesn't make the game a children game.

I really enjoyed my time with it until i got close to halfway through. At this point the game becomes stupidly difficult even on the lowest difficulty levels. I was forced to give up on the game because of this, and a quick seach of the internet indicates that I'm not alone. The developers say they lacked any outside play testing which ended up in them ramping up the difficulty because they, themselves, found the game too easy. Most indie studios do end up making rookie mistakes that lower the quality of their game. It just so happens in this case that it completely ruins the game altogether. There is no way i can recommend this game to anyone based on this. Unless you're some strategy genius, or are willing to put in 10s of hours into the game to figure out the perfect strategies, you'll just be wasting your time on a game that you'll never be able to complete, let alone enjoy"
,Recommended,218510,12124632,"Posted: 16 September, 2014",all,RockstarCRO,"This games premise is simple, so if your looking for something super complex it's not here. Strategy and tactics do exist though as taking which planet and when to attack and when to defend becomes extremely critical. One move can cost you a planet and sometimes if your not quick enough to react, the game.The premise is your a certain colony of either humans or robots, and you start conquering worlds one by one. Some battles can take place with one or up to three AI's. Of course, each sector is it's own game, so don't look to go Star Wars and try to conquer an entire galaxy. You start the game, and you are able to choose linearly which sector to attack next. Once you are at the in-game screen, the battle begins. Planets can be upgraded and can be selected to either defend or allow for attacks. Some planets when properly upgraded have some self defense mechanisms... although I wouldn't highly rely on it. Game types vary (which is always a good idea in any game) where one game may be domination where you need to take ALL planets whereas another game may have to do with monetary means to win - meaning more money you have the more powerful your units are. Send an attack wave to an enemy planet though and watch your assets freeze as your at war. Small divot game-types such as these keep the game interesting and want you to play more.This game is good, however NOT RECOMMENDED FOR EVERYONE! If you like space games and a casual indie territory take-over game this may be for you.

You start with some planets and sending ships between your planets is free, however sending them to conquer planets costs money and you have to manage between sending enough ships and having enough money so that the ships you send dont become too weak because the ships power is based on the amount of money you have. The robot race is slightly diferent but you can only play it in multiplayer or play in the same multiplayer maps but agaisnt bots.You also can change your planets between space stations, banks and normal planets with cities and each have their own utility but that is the extent of the game complexity.On the singleplayer campaign your will face a few bosses and three races: the humans, the robots and a mutant insect race. There is few game modes presents in the game and the campaign early on teaches about the various modes and it has a robot race tutorial. I had fun playing however some of the late game levels are absurdly hard to the point where one of them I simply stopped trying to beat it on hard mode and even on normal thay are quite dificult. Also the capaign is 20 hours long at most.I have over 50 hours on record because I played some multiplayer matches with people on the foruns to get the achievements however the last achievement is kinda bs because it requires you to kill an absurd amount of enemies that is only achievable by playing over a 100 hours of this game.In regards to multiplayer is lacking in game lobby listing and there isn't a proper game matching system the only way to play it is with friends. Also this game doesn't have Co-op it is just PvP.In conclusion, you can find some enjoyment in this game however I only recomend picking this up on sale."

,Recommended,218510,12032605,"Posted: 9 September, 2014",all,EsotericMoniker,"While clearly inspired by Galcon, Planet's Under Attack adds some much needed depth to the formula. Your planets produce units as in Galcon but attacking requires money. While you attack you don't generate money. Also, the closer you are to your money cap, the more powerful your ships are. Also, sending ships to defend a planet you already control costs nothing. This creates a wonderful risk/reward balance where you want to commit to attacks you can win, and only with just enough ships to take it.Now add in 2 other races that each have modified rules for production (think the races in Starcraft 2 and how they are similar but unique in how they go about it) and you have not only a fine single player game but a great multiplayer setup. The campaign unfortunately only features the humans.If you liked Eufloria, Mushroom Wars, or Blue Libra 2, there's definitely something new to like here."

I didn't really enjoy playing it.I didn't enjoy the game play mechanic very much. As the humans (the main campaign team), you don't gain income when attacking. While I understand that it's meant to penalize constant attacking, I found it annoying. I would have preferred to have more control over my ships, rather than just directing them to a specific planet.The difficulty level in the later missions is way too high, apparently due to lack of playtesting (apparently the devs didn't have anyone outside the company give it a try). The campaign missions put you at a huge disadvantage and trying to beat the AI is more frustrating than challenging. Maybe the multiplayer would be more fun (playing against a human instead of the AI).I'm not a big fan of the graphics. I find it looks garish and cartoony, though I do see what they were going for. I feel like this type of game is better when the art is more abstract.

You click on another planet and hold the mouse button to determine how many ships you want to send; neutral planets/your own planets dont cost any money to invade, but enemy planets do--at least for the human race, the only race i've played as so far, but i've read that the robots play differently--and you go from there, upgrading your planets to increase taxes and building up your defenses by transferring ships to increase the population. Again, on the surface, simple, but a game can quickly dissolve into chaos requiring quick thinking and quicker clicking to turn the tide.Definitely recommended if you get a coupon, but for $10, its a great strategy time killer that also has a fun multiplayer.

However, there are a few things to consider:1. With limited strategy decisions, the possibilities of achieving victory fall short but it can be argued that the several game modes contradict this.2. The difficulty quickly drops from introductory tutorials an onslaught of difficult levels that may need to be repeated severl times.3. There is a lack of change in scenery as there are layout choices but the overall visuals never deviate from what is seen on face value.Aside from this, there is potential here for a great party game and a quick mini-game if you're running out of things to play. At the price it is now, I would definitely reccomend it but don't expect a large amount of content for the origional price.P.S. I have a low play time as I have played this offline."

You can't generate money while attacking so you need to stockpile a bunch to overwhelm your enemy, otherwise if they defend they will still be generating money and counter attack you while you are weakened. That's it. There's no controls to choose which of your planets to attack from, there's no moving your ships around, it's really quite dumb.

The money can be spent on upgrades, attacks, or hoarded for a combat buff. The ships are sent out in streams to conquer enemy planets and defend your own.This genre of game is not new, and variants of it can be found for free on sites like Kongregate. But this game has much better graphics and sound/music compared to the free versions.There are various tech upgrades that you can earn and equip in a limited number of slots. There are different game types to keep things fresh such as Elimination (kill everyone) and King of the Hill (control a certain planet for a set period of time).There are different kinds of planets and opponents to fight as well. For example, one planet is an ""infested"" planet which is covered with alien eggs. This planet will remain neutral while a timer counts down. When the timer reaches zero the eggs hatch and the previously neutral planet suddenly becomes a major threat. The player will have to weigh the pros and cons of destroying the infested planets before pursuing the main objective, or hoping to rush to victory before the eggs hatch and the situation becomes untenable.The story is about an entrepreneur who goes looking for riches in an uncharted area of space while being hounded by intergalactic debt collectors. It was mildly entertaining but the ending left a lot of loose ends.Multiplayer seems mostly dead, so I played only single player.The controls are simple, actually a little too simple since there is no pause button I could find. Things get hectic very fast in this game with streams of hundreds of ships criss-crossing the map at any given time. A delay of even a few seconds in terms of not attacking or upgrading can spell defeat for the player. The AI is quick to notice any opening in your defenses and pounce.I went into this game thinking it would be casual entertainment that wouldn't make me think. Wrong!It starts out easy enough with some generous tutorial missions. After that the difficulty level starts ramping up exponentionally. By mission 10 I figure most casual gamers have been blown away. By mission 16 I figure all but the most die-hard strategists have been wiped out. I'm a glutton for punishment though, and I like a good challenge, so I toughed it out and beat all 30 missions of the single player campaign. Even the Easy difficulty level was ludicrously difficult. You have been warned!If you're a casual gamer looking for an easy game, look elsewhere. If you're a hardcore strategist who isn't afraid of fast-paced micro-managing this game might be for you."
