,Recommended,218620,32853425,Posted: 27 June,all,stobarticus,"Great game, high replayability... One of those games that just get better and better the more you play it.Check the hours played of negative reviewers first, they generally have at least a few hundred, if not in the thousands.. let that speak for itself. Generally just minor gripes, nothing worth giving a thumbs down.Overkill get a bad rap, I think mostly from people with little experience in other games. IMO they are one of the best dev teams around. They made one bad business decision in the past, but since fixed it. They listen to their customers and are constantly adding content, rebalancing and continuing the development of the game, taking ideas back to the drawing board based on user feedback. This is rare these days.The game has some issues, as you would expect with a game built on an outdated engine.-Desync is the most prominent issue, however a fix is currently in beta. For the moment, it is advised to only stealth solo.-Graphics are somewhat outdated. Look at any AAA game with great visuals and you will notice a distinct lack of AI on the map at any one time, compare that to 80+ cops hunting you down, plus any AI teammembers you might have. It is a necessary compromise.-There are a lot of cheaters and they won't be banned from the game. However, this is another compromise; Payday 2 is a highly moddable game, from retextures to HUDs and all kinds of other, often silly, things. On the flipside, it is very easy to make friends in Payday and the community is, for the most part, pretty decent. Play with friends and host your own games.-The update system requires you to have around the same of amount of spare disk space as the current game files' size on the drive the game is installed on.As for the pro's:If an update breaks anything, you can guarantee a hotfix if not the same day then the next.The skills and perks systems allow for endless experimentation.A lot of maps to play.The ability to go loud and proud or sneaky stealth (not all missions, but quite a few)A wide array of weapons to choose from and the ability to accessorise them to your needs once you learn how the skill system works.Happy heisting!"

But after microtransactions and more and more DLC's i had to give it a bad review. They were promising free content and instead we got paid DLC's and microtransactions. So Overkill will most likly go on with this trend of money making.Don't get me wrong its one of my favorite games. But if you are new do not buy it unless you are willing to spend more money on DLC's that will come out over time. Because even with a -75% sale on everything the game with everything costs ~33€. And after some time you maybe dont want to wait for a sale to get the newest DLC.So what i want to tell you is that you will invest more money into the game. The content is good overall but you will have to pay more than you think.Also playing with ""publics"" (people you don't know) can be pretty annoying. It's ok for a while but sometimes you just want a break from them.So if you want to play it be ready to spend some money on DLC and maybe microtransactions (for Weapon Skins which are cosmetic) and get yourself into a group to play Payday with."

Your game was great, but after the recent activities, you seem to be missing the actual point of the game by miles. Skins, crates, medieval weapons, a ton of story-unfriendly heisters, trading, and microtransactions? Really?I bought all your DLC, followed your every post, your every update, your every move with this game. But lately, you turned PAYDAY 2 into another mainstream cashgrab. My friends and I had a lot of fun, but this stops because of you and your greed.You ♥♥♥♥ed up, simple as that.Edit1:OVERKILL's community mods also began deleting negative feedback in the forums. Censorship is the last water drop in an already flooded garage. I'm just so done with this.Edit2:They finally removed microtransactions! Reason enough for me to play the game again. However, their mistakes are too many for me to have a positive attitude towards them. For now.Edit3:If you are a new player, I advise you to not look at Edit1, as it was created the same week as this review. Though it is still worth a look, depending on your opinion on such matters.

My review is going to stay negativ even if its not a bad game got some worse in my library.

I played a bit of the first game and thought it was an interesting new concept done well by an up-and-coming indie team. I was right. It was fun. PAYDAY was an enticing, original game that knew not to take itself too seriously. I very much liked the idea. The sequel did a great job of refining and expanding on the gameplay concepts that were introduced in the original; as well as elaborating on the purposely far-fetched story. I thought PAYDAY 2 was an amazing game. That all changed when PAY2WIN arrived...They started with a few cheap DLCs. What's the harm, right? Pretty much all mainstream games release one or two payed downloadable content packs at some point, these days. It's a way of keeping the community interested by freshening up the game a little. I honestly prefer a few DLCs or expansions as opposed to releasing a new sequel every year just to make sure that society doesn't forget you exist (COD). However, I soon found out that what PAYDAY 2 had planned was far worse than anything Call of Duty has EVER done. Overkill released DLC after DLC after DLC after DLC. They just kept coming. Each one more ""elaborate"" than the last. If you call paying $5 for a stupid new overpowered weapon elaborate. They incessantly released plethoras of ridiculous content that had little to add to the game but give the purchaser a purpose-defeating advantage. They're essentially payed cheat codes, in the sense that a lot of these DLCs pretty much make the game EZ mode. I honestly think that Overkill does not give a♥♥♥♥♥♥about their ""community"" anymore. All they seem to know or care about these days is that DLC=$$$. What really♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me the ♥♥♥♥ off is this new ""Black Market Update"" or whatever the ♥♥♥♥ they called it. It's literally a copy-paste of the Arms Deal Update from CS:GO. LITERALLY THE SAME ♥♥♥♥ING THING. I mean I understand that they're purposely making this update resemble Counter-Strike, but I don't get why. Obviously it's because CS:GO keys and crates have made Valve a fortune, but what's with the unapologetic rip-off of Valve's style? Are they trying to be ironic? Because it's not ironic. It's not funny, or witty, or clever, or even mildly amusing. The whole update was completely unnecessary and just makes Overkill look like the money-grubbing sleazeballs that they obviously are. I WILL NEVER RECOMMEND THIS GAME TOANYONE. A couple of years ago, I would have told all of my friends about how fun and original PAYDAY 2 was, and I did; but this game and its devs are garbage now. FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, DO NOT GIVE THESE IDIOTS YOUR MONEY!"

kind of,they decided to buy the right back from the publisher and be free to do what they want with the PayDay 2 franchise,still tho as stated by Producer at overkillHerethey said that ALL the MT's idea was an Overkill idea not a publisher one so yeah,nice commercial practices right there...Now that they said that they are gone(MT's),i still want to wait and see what times have to give us,they still have to fix a heck ton of stuff in the game,still have to fix♥♥♥♥♥♥ton of bugs here since the game beta,discutable DLC's quality to a too high price(for the content/quality)So as last statement i would say well done OVERKILL,for the roll back(still tho strange,first they say it's profitable then maybe as someone suggested because of the Skin unlockers they where not that profitable anymore)keep doing this,but really now focus on providing some high quality content.My review will still remain negative until i don't see a even more step in the right direction,this is a start A GREAT START but a lot of steps have to be made still to turn this on positive again.EDIT:couple days later edition:Just to be more clear,i think that is NOT all forgiven AT ALL,as i said up there's still♥♥♥♥♥♥ton of stuff to fix,feature promised since the release of the game still not released,discutable quality of the DLC's and lots of other stuff,oh and people think that the publisher was the evil guy that ""force"" them to develop MT's well,maybe it's true,my opinion?

,Not Recommended,218620,17521930,"Posted: 13 August, 2015",all,NegativeEight,"EDIT: While the game has been reclaimed by the original developers without extra additions, it currently feels as if it's a dead horse, being beaten with the skin and DLC stick.This game is generally good, and has a plethora of user-created mods available to tint and color your experience in slaughtering endless hordes of cops.  But enough of the rose colored filter and let's get down and dirty with the biggest negatives of the game.1. The community is quite terrible for both online play and the fanboys supporting the developers for their shady business practices. You'll often find yourself being kicked from games for seemingly no apparent reason other than you're new and/or learning the game, or haven't tailored your character or put on the right mask for the host, who is apparently some incarnation of a god. Joining a friend usually solves this problem.2. Peer to Peer game hosting - You'll always be at the mercy of someone else if you don't host yourself, the game is liable to crashes, freezing, frequent desync issues, and random disconnects.3. The game has an infurating amount of DLC, and your performance compared to the players who do have the DLC is almost insulting. An example of this being the Gage Sniper Pack. Make no mistake, with this game you will have to PAY.4. A worrying trend with Overkill as of late is that they are pumping out a lot of content which generally has little to no effect on gameplay as a way of keeping the community temporarily satisfied, and occasionally bundling it up as DLC.  What was a boatload of hype with ""The Dentist"" and his final contract ended up in massive amounts of disappointment, with little more than a rushed environment and tons of video game references in ""The Golden Grin Casino Heist"".5. When Overkill does make content that affects gameplay, it is usually overkill (No pun intended) on how it's balanced- creating a scenario where you become the weak link in the chain if you don't use said items or skill builds.6. The nature of some of the DLC content has become Pay2Win, for instance - The Buzzer, a melee weapon from the latest Golden Grin Heist.  Using this melee weapon on any enemy character will stun them for a few moments including Special Police Units. This trivializes the danger of the units and undermines the actual teamwork needed to control the threats in harder difficulties.7. The game fosters an environment where you can tailor skill points to your play style, however you'll find yourself having to pick and take skills from every tree to manage both stealth and loud combat missions effectively.8. Stealth mechanics are acceptable in singleplayer, where a mis-step on your part can mean having to fight hordes of cops with little to no armor and silenced weapons.  However, multiply the risk of getting detected by 3 and then times that to a random number generator and you have multiplayer. The desync in this game creates a near impossible setup for players to effectively stealth together as AI detection and line of sight is managed by the host and not the client (who is usually just moments behind the host).What usually happens to be a fun and simple game to understand with friends becomes a mess of complexity when you throw in a toxic online community and hordes of DLC that will end up sucking both your wallet and satisfaction away."

With two more years of DLC cash grab coming up I no longer have faith in this game. Yes, DLC is optional but the game without DLC is rather limited and not worth it's money. The insane amount of DLC also creates a large disparity between players where you have people who have to play with a pistol and a rifle and those who run around with rockets launchers and miniguns. You get kicked from games because you don't have the right DLC related mask or weapon and hosting your own missions is out of the question unless you're willing to spend huge amounts of money on buying the required DLC. This sort of DLC policies ruin the gaming industry and based on all this I simply can't recommend the game.And now they added microtransactions in what was supposed to be a period of free updates (crimefest). This only adds to my earlier frustration and only confirms my earlier message."

But you know my money, and you took quite a lot of it without returning anything of reasonable value. I bought your game back when it was in beta testing. You know, when you promised us alpha and beta players we where only playing 1/3rd of the game? And that pre-orders would get all future content for free?I cringed when you lied about us only playing 1/3rd of the game in beta. All you did was unlock our levels to level past 30. And gave us 1 tiny heist that was identical to the smallest map you had already. Only this one was so quickly done that it literally could be run in just 43 seconds or less.I moaned when you started releasing DLC heists rather than adding to the free ones you had promised us. I even b*tched when you only gave us pre-order alpha and beta players a single $5 DLC for our investment into the game's future.But the thing that made me stop playing was not any one thing, It was everything. Your total disregard for your consumers has lead me and all of my friends, of which there where a sizable few, to not touch your game in years. The last heist I did willingly for fun was Shadow Raid for point of fact. Back when it was freshly released not even a week old.A friend who was new to the game was given a free copy of all of your DLCs and in turn bought me the few i needed to be current. We did the Hoxton break out as it was new, and again, I noticed you where pushing buttons and calling shots that made no sense except to force players to play your game more, and pay you more money.As it was, i had to do asanine and repetitive things like get 20 zipline head shots with a bolt action sniper that had no scope to get said scope. None of which was fun and only served to force me to play in a way that was both counter productive to the team, and left me without a usable weapon as this was the new meta sniper at the time.That is only one example of how you'd turned this game into DLC Quest. And what of your lies that pile upon this? We where promised things to do with our off shore money, and even before release we where told the main game had safe house customization.Nothing ever came in the time I played. Nothing of reason or value. And as to my knowing safe house customization is still not in the game, but I could be wrong. The point of fact here is that both of these things where promised within the first 2 months of release or even -AT- release in the case of safe house customization. But they where blatant lies designed to get our money.I may well be crucified by your blinded masses of hysterical followers for posting this, but the message will be clear regardless. After spending nearly 100$ in this game, I still don't have all of the DLCs, nor do I want them at the rate you're going.You're not getting a penny more from me, nor my friends who use to enjoy this game. And that pains me as it was one of the most fun games of recent memory, even competing with Skyrim, and trumping Overwatch for the shear fun.But if I have to keep paying for your DLCs to stay in current content. If I have to do asinine, borderline moronic, achievements for critical items. If I have to be force fed lie after lie, I do not want to play your game. Nor will I play the next.When Payday 3 comes out. There had best not be any DLC for the first 6 months. You owe us that much. The first 6 months should be free content as you'd promised us we'd get this time but lied to us about. I and those i played with will not be buying 3 if there is any DLC in the first 6 months.Money talks. You built a game a bout stealing it, and in the process stole mine. It's time to put your theft where it should be, in the game not in reality.Yours truly,A very disappointed, and spurned fan.PS: Even having spent at or arround $120 on this game, and owning over half the DLCs it would still take another $90 to buy all the current DLC I dont own. Buyer beware, they will nickle and dime you to death.PPS: I'd like to iterate that payed DLC is not a bad thing. It’s the content and quality Vs price margien i'm upset with, a well as frequency of paid Vs free DLC. The main issue is in fact the lying about what preorders and the like would be getting. Had guns and missions been packed together more frequently resulting in about half as many DLC, I'd likely have bought more DLC and played longer as a genuine truth. Had all Missions been Free and guins been the only DLC, i'd likely have been able to pick and choose what i want, or need in the case of meta weapons, easier. Or had all guns been free and missions been the only payed DLC i'd likely have been less happy with that than any other option but it’s still preferred to what you’re doing now.(Edit/Update: After reviewing my account histroy I have revised the numbers on costs. All financial cost is now factual, and nolonger rough approximations based on memory.)"

However, in 2016, they've knocked it out of the park consistently. At this point in time, Payday 2 is a solid co-op shooter that I would recommend to any fan of Left 4 Dead or Borderlands.The premise is simple: you and three other people bring two ridiculously-customizable weapons (stocks, sights, compensators, paint jobs, weapon bodies, and more!) along with some other goodies and commit organized crimes. Missions are diverse, from robbing banks to ambushing convoys of armored cars. The jobs vary by mission, but you usually fight waves of cops until you complete enough objectives to escape. You can also silently complete most missions in stealth, but that can get tedious with repeated failures. When you're not stealing priceless goods and fighting the law, you can purchase and customize masks with in-game money, gamble on free item drops, and pay visits to your safehouse.It's simple, addicting, and overall a good time, especially with friends and voice chat. For the most part, the game is balanced and accessible. It does have loads and loads of DLC, but they are cheap and usually bundled together these days, so you can get almost every weapon for under 10 dollars on sale. Occasionally, Overkill releases free content to the game in patches, meaning you can still look forward to new additions to the game without using your Steam Wallet.What else can I say? Overkill has redeemed itself. I would recommend buying Payday 2, though I would hold off until it goes on sale so you can grab a lot of the DLC alongside of it."

Sure there were some problems with the map chooser (cant pick any heist without paying, ect.) But Overkill promised support, and 3 DLC's.They lied.I am not a big fan of lots of DLC, and Overkill decided to put out a bunch of DLC.  Still not a problem, but when the DLC is $6-$8 a pop, and gives us either one new heist or 2 - 3 guns, I am disappointed. Making the bread and butter of the DLC's different masks I still was fine with, even though there is absolutely no way to check out my face in game. If there was some sort of taunt like in TF2 that would put me in the 3rd person view, I would enjoy that more, but as it is there is no way to even enjoy what I am wearing. (Yeah blah blah blah, you can go to your safehouse. Dont even get me started on the lies and deception surrounding that. Almost 2 years and no safehouse upgrades, unlike what Overkill said during pre-production. ""It takes time to do good work"". smh)EVEN WITH ALL OF THIS I was not upset. I bought all the DLC up to the Diamond Heist because I found value in it. But when the diamond heist and Clover came out, I did not feel that they were worth it. I was gonna wait for a sale. Then they started doing the butcher stuff, and I still did not buy any DLC because it was still not worth it. Crimefest stuff not completed (""it takes time to do good work"") and then the hype train hit and it was $5 for 2 guns (one secondary that does 10000 dmg, gg) and $20 for 4 ""unusual"" masks (Still cant see my face) and one ""Secret"" item out of 25 possible secret items. On a RNG. For $20. But hey, whatever, they are going to do a new infamy update anyways and free mod packs. But the free mod pack got turned into a pay mod pack ($5 of course) and when called on it, Overkill said, this is not the mod pack you think it is, this is a different one. Even though it has the same promo image, and it was dropping glitched items from the other mod pack (free one) also. Seems legit. But, hey this is all free, you will get (more) free enemies (when they are done) like the last one (""it takes time to do good work"") and the magical Infamy 2.0 is coming out.Infamy 2.0 came out and it was terrible. 2000 more levels, with the only rewards being masks and XP boosts. (Yo dawg, I put an XP boost into your leveling up, so that you can level while you level) I never felt happier about not buying things. A lot of people felt that this was not good. As a matter of fact, lots of people didn't like it. I read a lot about people cancelling their pre-order of the $5 and $20 overkill packs. There must have been a lot, because they fired out the overkill pack DLC early, IMHO because too many people were cancelling their purchaces. They never did anything like this before (""it takes time to do good work"") so I have to assume that they felt the pinch. But the straw that broke the camels back was the 10 acheivements tied to the Overkill pack.I am a completionist. I love doing acheivements. As a matter of fact, Acheivements are what I do. Now I can not 100% your game without purchacing a limited-time DLC. No. Never. If the game was something that I felt good playing anymore I would in a heartbeat. But no. You sell DLC that is nothing but mods, and then require people to complete acheivements just to get the items you paid for. No. Never again. I enjoyed Payday.This is not Payday."

76561197999406618,Not Recommended,218620,28494211,"Posted: 20 December, 2016",all,ThaDaLinkWent,"Well if you're at least somewhat reasonable you'll at least hear me out for what I have to say and not rage out on me for having an oppossing opinion about a game you happen to enjoy and some of its design choices. My opinion should not stop or hinder you from playing a game you enjoy. For a time I genuinely enjoyed this game but decisions among the team about which direction the game should go and certain design choices has slowly made me shy away from the game gradually.Problem #1The Update FormatFor starters the way the game updates is viciously frustrating on a number of levels for many people. Everytime the game needs to update itself, it needs an extra 30 GB of harddrive space temporarily to copy all files and make a replica of your entire game. The update is then installed on the replica game file. If the update installs properly and successfully, the old game files are removed and replaced by the new patched version giving you back the 30 GB of harddrive space it used up for the update process. It has been said they use this method to protect your games files so you don't have to redownload the entire game again which I guess makes sense but comes at too high a price with a really big unforseen flaw.The giant flaw being every single time the game needs to updates itself you must always, always, always have an extra 30 GB of space available for the game to update itself without incident. For some gamers this update process is neither feasible or practical. Just because this has been the way the game updates itself since day one of its release doesn't mean this update design choice shouldn't change. It was a poor design choice then and poor design choice now. Shouting, harassing and insulting people to get bigger harddrives or just don't play the game at all if they don't like the way the game updates itself, does not in anyway shape or form fix that particular problem. At best that's just a way to bypass the problem rather than fix it.Problem #2Weekly updates.So the question people are thinking now is ""So you like playing broken games huh?"" No. No I do not enjoy playing broken games. I have no problems with frequent updates to a game 90% of the time BUT issues with problem #1 makes updates for this particular game both stressful and annoying. On top of that this game in particular is known for its ridiculous update sizes ranging from 500MB up to 5GB. PayDay 2 acts like it's the only game that matters on your harddrive and doesn't care that you might have to erase and redownload multiple game titles just to update it.Problem #3The nearly infinite ""DLC Problem""Yeah, yeah I know people who defend this practice chant the mantra of ""You don't need it to play the game!"" ""You don't need it to play the game!"" ""You don't need it to play the game!"". Yeah I get it we heard you the first time. PayDay 2 and its DLC could be compared to a brand new car that literally has one seat in it. Yes it's true the car works completely fine without the 2 back seats and the passenger seat but it is still a waste of space and looks hideous without them in that regard. Then there's that one person screaming YOU'RE NOT ENTITLED TO FREE STUFF!!!. Never said I was entitled to free stuff nor was I asking for it. What I'm saying is there is very little weapon variety in the base game. And veterans of the game can easily tell you out of the small weapon pool of the base game there is only a handfull of weapons worth using. It's rather depressing trying to choose a proper weapon only to be bombarded by 2-3 pages of locked DLC weapon content glowing in your face. At the very least give me the option of being able to hide DLC weapons in my inventory for gosh sakes!Problem #4A.I Behavior and DesignCombat with the A.I in the game has always felt a little bit on the sloppy side but more and more as the months have gone on it seems to have gotten much more messy. I was hoping the two new difficulty settings they implemented a little while back would allieviate the problem. Sadly it didn't. Difficulty in PayDay 2 doesn't come from intelligent A.I tactics and manuvering. Difficulty in this game comes from the A.I overwhelming you with their numbers and the fact that on higher difficulty settings they are massive bullet sponges. Never once have I thought ""Wow this is difficult because they are so tactical!"" No it's difficult because there are 80 cops onscreen shooting in the same direction! Someone is bound to hit you in that scenario. Personally I would like to see smarter A.I with better damage and accuracy and drastically lower health. Enemy A.I being able shrug off a single 50 caliber shot at pointblank range on the highest difficulties is just ridiculous.Problem #5The All Encompassing RNG FactorPayDay 2 is legendary in its irritating manner in which players aquire weapon parts and mask materials through the use of RNG. This is a rather poorly thoughtout way to attempt to artificially extend gameplay well past the point of enjoyment and fun sometimes. Some people (Not all people) on PayDay 2 have a crazy amount of hours spent on the game specifically grinding for very specific weapon parts and mask materials they need or want. Plenty of PayDay 2 players know exactly how they wish to build their weapons for specific situations and heist and also for their specific style of gameplay. Overkill should just make an in-game store for Gage A.K.A (""The Weapons Dealer"") for players so they can simply purchase the weapon parts (Grips, Muzzles, Weapon sights, Weapon stocks...etc) they need with in-game cash for a specific scenario or heist without the hassle of praying to the stars above that the RNG gods gives them something useful after a mission.Some people might be quick to point out that there is something similar to what I just mentioned already in-game BUT the way PayDay 2 does this revolves around gambling & RNG chance rendering it yet again useless. You're gambling away massive amounts of money on the POSSIBILITY you MIGHT get something you really need. And you don't even get to pick what specifically you need but rather you choose the category from which it randomly drops. Gambling away massive amounts of your money at the very low possibility you'll get what you actually need does not seem very tempting ultimately and therefore I've only used this feature 3 times and never again after that.*Update* (Jan 23, 2017)And yes I'm well aware the many people pointing out the fact you can buy weapon mods with continental coins but that too just brings up a big question. WTH was wrong with simply using in-game cash for weapon mod purchases rather than having to kick out continental coins??? Why make purchasing weapon mods a task in itself? Why further undermine the value and usefulness of in-game cash by tossing an optional arbitrary currency into the mix? Continental are also used to upgrade the new hideout so if I have to choose between upgrading the hideout vs buying weapon mods, more times that not I'm gonna upgrade the hideout. Because to be honest the hideout without any upgrades in it is rather underwhelming to say the least. Some say upgrading the new hideout is optional and to a degree that's true. But at the same time SOME of the hideout upgrades have a function and purpose which renders upgrading your hideout rather necessary at times depending on your play style. I mean come on there are people out there with mountains of cash in their offshore accounts and nothing to really spend it on. The money in most people's off shore accounts could easily upgrade the hideout for gosh sakes if they were given the option."

I sure had fun times playing PAYDAY 2, but negativity outweigh positivity by a large margin.The core gameplay and music are quite good I'll admit that. However I promise that there will be a moment when there's nothing left in this game but annoyance.The graphics were simplistic to begin with but now it's laughable. The gore is non-existent and the way rag-dolls work makes kills unsatisfactory. The game is a time sink and a cash grab. Do you want that nice flashlight attachment? How about you waste a couple hundred hours grinding only to get a pile of masks and stupid patterns? And next thing you know, you're buying badly painted but expensive skins with pre-installed attachments. The difficulty is very inconsistent. You can spend half an hour playing normal when all of a sudden a dozen of special enemies charge and immobilize your whole crew. But it's more likely that you won't play the game that long 'cause it will crash.The way developers update the game and the frequency of those updates is nonsensical. Each update makes even top PC struggle, making it straight unusable for an hour or more which forced me to delete the game and redownload the whole thing every time update occurs. And with 100+ major updates and hundreds of ""hotfixes"" (and most updates turn the game into bug infested mess) it became the most annoying thing I've experienced in videogames. Also they constantly change the stats and perks forcing you to waste hours adjusting your build for no good reason.The company is run by greedy bullies who attack paying customers if they feel that certain achievement was unlocked too quick. They want you to grind same boring heists all day long for months until you buy all $140+ DLCs and boosted skins to win and even then they'll find the way to screw you over. Joined a lobby with a DW heist that is about to end? Too bad, you're a cheater now.Shame on you, Overkill."

I had hoped for more but i would have accepted the little content there was and i would have appreciated for what it is. What i cant accept however is Overkills DLC policy.Sadly DLC has become a huge part of modern games, but Overkill truly takes it to the next level.At the moment there is DLC worth somewhere around 110€ in the game, most of it being guns or gun attachements, but there are also quite a lot of heists hidden behind a paywall. Now i'm sure a lot of people are screaming at the screen right now trying to convince themselves that the DLC is completely optional, that however is only half true.Because what is a heisting game without the heists?You're not going to enjoy this game too much with only the basegame heists and the free updates that come along every year or so dont really add that much gameplay either.Now aside from the DLC, they added another feature to the game, which basically gives you gun skins which gives you a bonus to your stats. These gun skins can only be optained from saves which can only be opened with drills that you have to buy with real money. This cs:go esqué pay2win update has been the last straw for me.Overkill tries to squeeze the most they can out of the customer with the least amount of work possible.A big amount of content they have added to the game over time, actually came from the modders in the payday community. Overkill literally copies their code and charges you for it.And if you ever try to criticise them on the steam forum you can expect your posts to be removed instantly and you may even be banned.So, should you give your money to Overkill?No.Not even if the game is on a 90% sale.Dont support these terrible devs and this ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game."

Then they started churning out one or two five-dollar DLC every month with a few weapons or a new map. I was okay with that for a while. It was optional and half of them were free.But they really started to pile up. Where other game studios would have been working on their next game, Overkill decided they would just work on one game forever, apparently. To fund this obsession/laziness/whatever it is, they decided to ♥♥♥♥ their customers out of as much money as they would allow. Sadly, many customers allow them to bend them over and have their way with them and then ask for more.They introduced CS: GO style skins that are acquired from paid unboxing, except unlike those kinds of systems, the skins rarely have an additional stat boost. This would already be unbalanced and an unacceptable pay-to-win mechanic that shouldn't exist at all, let alone in a paid game. But to make matters worse, they nerfed many of the weapons already in the game so that people would have to get these skins just to have weapons that work at all.This ridiculous skin fiasco was the immediate predecessor to their still ongoing attempt to make this game a viable 'e-sports' title, because they've ramped their greed all the way up and have decided they need some of that pie in addition to the princely sum they've already milked from their dwindling playerbase.The outcry over their actions was such that even their forum moderators went on strike over it. In their arrogance, they announced a hollow apology while steadfastly refusing to back down from their exploitative practices.Following this game's current trajectory, I expect them to announce a monthly subscription fee some time in the near future. I could say more, but I better hurry up and get this review posted before they start charging $2.99 for it."

76561198073366530,Not Recommended,218620,13287830,"Posted: 8 December, 2014",all,Smiley Grenade,"Let me just quickly list off the things that ruined this game for me personally, and that anyone who might be interested in purchasing this game should know before buying. I do not make this review lightly, and I myself have played the game thoroughly. I however cannot forgive some of this game's faults. They are the following:-Terrible money-grab DLC's. The gage shotgun pack is perhaps the worst here, and in my opinion the courier pack is perhaps the best (simply due to the fact that you now have some slight control over what gun attachments you are getting). But to pay $5+ to recieve a few specific guns only to have all of the modifications locked behind impossible to get achievements is ridiculous. For example, ""Unusual Suspects"" in the Watchdogs job, you have to complete the mission with four different friends all wearing different DLC masks. This is an obvious ploy to convince your friends to waste their money on the DLC as well so you can get the mods the achievement unlocks. While you are not necessarily forced to buy the dlc content, the game does get dull after a while, and the presence of all the DLC makes it all the more obvious that if you want a few more hours of gameplay out of this game the devs are going to milk you for all it's worth and then some.-Mob spam. What's that? You crave more difficulty? Instead of perhaps, improving the AI, allow us to instead drown you in a sea of tasers and shields to create the illusion of difficulty!-Specials are ridiculous. Shields are perhaps the most annoying considering they trace your exact movement to the point that they will clip the shield through their body to block you. Don't expect to be able to shoot their hands or feet either. Tasers have a tendency to hit you through cars, and they have almost no cooldown from what I can tell. Cloakers, clearly equiped in light armor, can take up to 3 shotgun shells to the face before finally dying. I'd say the only thing done right are the bulldozers.-There are no real tactics once you've gone loud. Expect to everyone to just run around the map. You honestly can't completely hold a position or a room due to the AI's instict of simply walking right up to you (or THROUGH you). Your team full of random people will most likely just be wandering the map doing their own thing unless it's strictly stealth. AI can hardly use cover. The game will basically zerg you to death.-This game uses card draw at the end of every heist to determine if you get a mask, a mod, a pattern (for mask), instant cash, or a colorscheme (for pattern). Cards tend to get very repetitive very fast. This alone would be fine, but the game has a way of punishing you for trying to farm these cards by debuffing your experience points (The largest exp reduction I have recieved was -15%, which is quite significant on Overkill). You will undoubtedly reach a point in the game where you have more money than actual stuff to buy.-AI teammates are the definition of useless. They cannot grab bags, they will not restart drills, and hell-- they can't even shoot straight. Basically the only thing you'll be doing by having AI teammates is giving yourself a couple of bullet sponges while you do all the actual work. They also have really bad judgement over weather to shoot the enemy or revive you, so expect the AI to do neither effectively.-No system for migrating hosts. Doesn't matter how long you've spent on a heist, if the player who started the lobby disconnects, all of your time has essentially just been wasted. This is a giant problem.-Game will randomly go out of sync. AI can be random places compared to other people's game. It gets especially confusing when AI flip a switch when in your view they are on the other side of a wall.- Finally, pay and experience don't really seem to correlate with mission difficulty. Some missions just aren't worth doing unless you're going for either variety or a skull mask.All-in-all, the game is definitely bearable, but having steam friends who play the game aswell was pretty much the only reason for the amount of hours I've poured into this game. These things I have listed are simply what finally drove me away from the game.(Also, anyone who feels so inclined as to try to give me tips on how to play the game, don't bother. I've logged over 200 hours into this game. I've figured everything out, there is really nothing you could possibly inform me of that I don't already know. If you have any objections as to the things I have stated I will revise this review accordingly.)"

,Not Recommended,218620,9286849,"Posted: 27 February, 2014",all,Badstormer,"The game isn't terrible, but it doesn't seem to be 'complete'.Although it far exceeds Payday: The Heist (More realistic gun mechanics, unlocks, customizable weapons, masks, customizable masks, quite a lot of new stuff in general), they failed to release things that they (1) Promised to release and were (2) In the original Payday.The game itself gets very repetitive, very fast. At first, it'll be fun. You get to choose how you want to handle the robbery. However, there aren't exactly a lot of ways to handle said robbery. Soon after completing one a few times, you'll come to realize this.Anyway, enough explaining, I'll get right to the pros/cons.Pros-----------------PartiallyRealistic Weaponry- More ways to complete a robbery- More weaponry- Customizable weapons- A few classic units from Payday: The Heist still exist here- Planning Phase in lobbies, blueprints and optional upgrades in said phase.- For those that hate the game, it's a piece of cake to cheat on. Literally no punishment is handed out.--------------------Cons------------------ Frequent payed DLC's are released, mostly stuff that was promised to be added to the main game.- Forum threads deleted to silence people who accused the Payday 2 developers of lying (which they certianly did)- Past level 40, you'll realize that there's hardly anything 'new' to do in the game other than grind- Very limited amount of robberies, although there are more than there are in The Heist- Card System: You get a random 'bonus' after completing a robbery. Sometimes it's cash, others experience, sometimes it's a modification, a mask, a mask modification, etc. You may ask why this is bad - it's the ONLY way to get these things. It's literally 100% luck.- One less AI on your side in Singeplayer, as if it wasn't already hard enough to solo.- 30% of the game is pretty much just a bag throwing simulator.- Repetitive heists; you've seen one of them, you've seen all of them.- Usual heist: (1) Infiltrate the place. (2) Get into the vault. (3) Grab the loot. (4) Take the loot and attempt to dodge bullets (and fail) while heading to the escape van. (5) Escape. Every goddamn time, it's the same thing, just a different map.- ""Five dollars to buy grenades? Seriously?"" - I see a lot of people comment on the weapon packs. Honestly, you can live without them if you're willing to give up a few achievements and slightly more firepower.- Takes a relatively high-end computer to run decently on low settings.- Annoying as hell AI; I've once had a Bulldozer spawn right in front of me. Guess what happened next.- Cheaters. Recently, their populations has slowly been dropping, but they still exist. The game has no anti-cheat whatsoever, so they're free to come back and destroy the game once more, and other people have nothing stopping them from cheating. Yet.- I could go on for hours about this, but that's the summary.----------------------Overall, this game isn't worth the money. Take it from someone who's tried Payday: The Heist, Payday 2 Beta, someone who has the DLC's for the games, and has given each a lengthly amount of time in-game.I'd give this game a 4/10, taking into consideration the developers will silence any criticism that they can possibly find. Maybe when they start giving us free DLC's that should have been in the damn game in the first place I'll change my rating of this game. Only reason I still bother to hop onto it is for it's achievements. (Yes, I'm insane.)If you want something that's more of a rage-game than a robbery game, Payday 2 is the game for you. Otherwise, do yourself a favor and forget this game. If I could get a refund, I sure as hell would.EDIT - 5/28/2014 - Overkill has been releasing a lot of (terrible) DLC for the game recently, as well as paying very little attention to the bugs in the game, plus the ridiculous amount of cheaters. (They fix a good amount of bugs, but there's a helluvalot more that they fail to fix.) - They reduced the size of the game, yes, but it's still a massive wait for an update/reinstall. Alongside that, their idea of an anti-cheat is to label someone as a cheater in-game.THAT'S IT.Surely by now, they'd have a better idea as to how to track down modified .lua files. Anyway, the rest of the review still stands as it is, just with a lot of terrible weaponry added and a whopping 2 new heists after many, many months of waiting.Another EDIT - 6/17/2014 - They're starting to add heists to the game that were originally promised to be thrown into the game. Now you get to pay an extra $7 for ONE EXTRA HEIST that is a tiny bit larger than a normal one.Edit 2.5 - 6/17/2014 -It turns out they also have a minus-boost system in place; if you play the same heist more than once in a row, you get a decrease in the amount of exp you get. So, getting to level 100 5 times to finally get all 5 Infamous ranks will take what was originally weeks to what is now months. Hope you enjoy.If you play one heist over too many times, you get a 100% minus-boost permanently. Likely a bug, but that's Overkill for you.EDIT - 2/27/2014 -Alright, they're starting to actually fix things in the game - of course, with every new DLC they throw at us, the developers break more things than they've ever fixed. Alongside that, cheaters are still not being punished. Ever since Payday: The Heist (Payday 1), nothing at all has been done about cheaters. Not a single ban, not a single temporary ban, not a single ♥♥♥♥ has been given. If you do grab this game, make sure you check everyone's profile that you've got in your lobby to ensure they do not have a large amount of achievements unlocked within a very short timespan in Payday 2 to ensure they do not cheat.EDIT: 7/3/2014 - Removed the con 'uninstalling and reinstalling the game'. What I meant by that is the game automatically unzips an entirely new download of itself, then just overwrites the updated files, rather than downloading only the updated files. They seem to have fixed this issue.EDIT: 8/3/2014 - Apparently people insist that are very few cheaters in the game. Personally, I come across an absurd amount of them, but most other people seem to never come across any. I'm likely just unlucky. Rather or not you want to pay attention to the (possible) cheater population is up to you. Personally, I've come across a lot less cheaters in the past week or so, so perhaps they are correct. Also modified the 'Cheaters' con."

After an IRS audit stemming from failure to report their gains from stealing mayan gold underneath the First World Bank, the Payday gang has been reduced to knocking down jewelry stores and running petty protection rackets in the DC/Metro area. However, the Unitesd States has passed a PATRIOT-like act that gives the FBI ability to respond to any crime, including armed robbery, extortion, jaywalking, and speeding. As such, the DC police force is completely willing to send dozens of officers to their death for $25,000. In addition, special ops units have been mobilized to be part of these FBI detachments, including units with titanium-laden riot shields that can take an inumerable amount of shots from the front, armed units with tazers providing incapacitating amounts of electricity, martial arts experts who are also part-time olympic runners who are put into tacticool suits, and a man in an EOD suit borrowed from the army. The FBI has also taken help from the 'Private Security Firm' Gensec, who is given a cut of the national budget, allowing them to field mercenaries in military gear and armor. Thankfully for the Payday gang, the position of 'bank guard' at GenSec does not require a high school degree, and as such pager operators do not realize that somebody completely different is talking on the other side of the line, at least until he's fallen for it four times. Now you must fight the man by stealing jewelry, breaking stuff, and stealing more stuff all across DC, all the while helping the gym bag industry.

However I will say without a doubt you will get your joy, fill and entertainment out of this game and what it has to offer. I am not here to talk about some of the issues already spoken about the game by others of the community, which goes a long way. And what I mean is the ridiculous amount of DLC or the Keys'n'Crates knickel and dime gimmicks this game has done that they talk about. So no, I will not be talking about that stuff because that already adds to the fire of why it gets a downvote.Aside from a great format and style gameplay unlike other games this one can be quite fun with friends and playing it on the fly to enjoy doing some bank heists with a good inventory and skill system. Along with a lineup of some good maps and content all over it which keeps that grinding replay value going. Of course I enjoy the game and many of its aspects overall but the undelying things i'm about to explain is why this game does not deserve it's perfect ""Very Positive"" rating that it appears to be receiving. And that is...1. The AI and Mechanics are broken- Yes the A.I is absolutely dumb. As for your CPU allies and NPC type allies they are a chore. They are all garbage. Everyone from your computer heist allies to Bain and others who pick you up that always push you through an endless wait time or grind in order to escape or get away. The game forces human players and not to mention that they are just bullet sponges and no real help. Also some actual game mechanics are way too sensitive, like by accident pressing the pager twice that triggers an alarm, or trying to slide in a keycard when a jammer or lockpick happens instead, Drills, Loadings and Uploads that for some strange reason break down or crashes every 2 minutes when these things in real life would never happen.2. The Enemy A.I is literally ""Overkill""- I can't stress enough how ludacris the enemy forces are no matter the map you are in. Whether it is stealth or loud. First with Stealth, it is literally trial and error. Basically every patrol and every civilian is always a link to another problem no matter how or where you are regardless of how much it is randomized. Which this always sets an alert. Try paging more than four times you're screwed, a civilian sees you or another guard you're screwed,  do anything within a inch of a camera you are screwed. Doing this over and over again when trying to sleuth your way past.Now as for the loud or when alarm goes off you will get bombarded by endless waves of cops, I mean non-stop. The assaults go on way too long in between sessions and you'll find yourself cornered or out of ammo within 10 minutes of it all, and i'm talking difficulties above Overkill. The enemy are bullet sponges, they are everywhere, they don't ever give breathing moments. The A.I in this overall game is just a hassle and that is the best word I can describe it. Way too overpowering, and your advantages are way too little.3. Poor Business Practice & Community- This is without a doubt a major point why this gets a negative, and that is the choices made by these developers and moderators. First off the Discussions page and Moderators are a rough bunch. Very freugal or punishing. They will lock discussions, ban people for mods or cheats, and lastly always being sarcastic or quick to close discussions. For the business practice...(sigh) the worse I have ever seen. Aside from DLC packs and Microtransactions - stuff I am not getting into. No, the real issue is locked or hidden content. That's right, With cross promotion and event content being blocked or missed out to the general population is just terrible. That means if you want to get the ""special masks and content"" you have to check up on websites and the actual inventories to when they schedule or release special items you only get if you are quick and on time when they come out. Or find yourself having to buy other game titles to get the content. If you want exclusive masks you have to be lucky and catch sweepstakes, or meet the yearly events, or when it comes to just getting a Mega Clover Mask that you have to snatch from key codes thrown out randomly by creators. The infamous Completely Overkill Pack argument which obviously is completely removed and unable to obtain because they are like ""♥♥♥♥ you we just don't want to put them out again or into a DLC."" Basically If you were not there for the events you miss out on supporting that and will never get it. Want special masks? Have to wait or catch moderators or the developers throwing out key codes. Want these special masks? You have to compete and join in our moderators competitions to get them, or come to the events halfway across the world. All of it is a turkey shoot.And when you can't get all the content or unable to obtain the stuff that you want from the actual game and put it behind events, restrictions, special celebration packs or secretive competitions than all I see is red flags because to many that alienates a lot of people from ever getting them.  Puts too much overload on gamers to try and finding and obtaining everything in the game. What if you planned on getting into Payday 2 now? You will be screwed! You won't be able to get all that content. And when those special events pass you will never get a chance in your lifetime to ever get them again, aside from Halloween or Xmas event. But to this day not being able to get the Completely Overkill DLC you missed a year ago is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, whether it is worth it or not we want to be able to get everything out of the game we paid big money for to have it all in the game. Along with all the new hidden loot, bundles, promotions and tournaments blocking out hidden content and downright missing out on all of it is just saddening.4. The Updates & In-Game Issues- This one could be endless with the random crashes to desktop when playing with the community or when hosting a map. Failed to join games. Random loading loops. Or they always leave, kick, disconnect or just being plain stupid when you play in random games or with others and all you do is try to help and play professionally. Terrible lag issues at times. The heavy slow inducing 30 GB updates everytime something comes out, The HUD, Toxic Community, the Beggers, The Infamy XXV-100 cheaters and so on.But if can look past all of this like I try and still enjoy this game a lot and for what it's worth this is still a fun game and has a lot of content and stuff to do in it that will definitely eat time in playing. But I strongly recommend you buy it on sale and with friends otherwise you will be overpaying what they do to it's source material. Just sayin'And when you play a game you still love to this day has all of this behind it. =>DLC / Bad Business Practices / Microtransactions / Rough Moderators / An Exclusive or Alienated Fanbase / Hidden-Cross Promotional Content.It is more than enough to shadow a huge positive sign to the game, the game is great but the many choices to it are pretty rough to say the least. and just like the moral of the game itself Overkill only thinks about one thing.Money."

It ruined the flow of the game completely by making you feel inferior to people who've got DLC guns and are capable of taking out Bulldozers with 2 shots to the face. That in my opinion does make this game pay to win. ""A game you buy being pay to win? HOW ABSURD"" you might think. However it's the sad truth. A game where it's focused on PVE entirely is pay to win. The second you can have an advantage in a game with weapons that are stronger than the ones you currently have in-game? Sure it's not TOO bad but this makes harder heists easier to escape if you, and all your friends are running around with purchased weapon packs, that are modded to hell. You can make the basic guns just as good, sure that's arguable. However doesn't change the fact these guns are better in almost every way. Please, if you're thinking of buying this game you're better off buying Payday 1."
,Not Recommended,218620,8286440,"Posted: 25 December, 2013",all,Rickenwing <∞>,"I want to keep this review short and to the point. Payday 2 fails in being a better game than Payday 1. Ultimately the quality of the heists is what really kills this game for me.*see edits at the bottom as I wanted to keep the review in it's original form*Positives:+ Better Gunplay, the guns feel like real guns in this game. I much prefer Payday 2's gunplay over 1.+ Weapon customization, definitely a great addition.+ Stealth improvement, definitely better stealth elements when compared to the first game.**Negatives:- Completely uninspired heists that mostly rely on bag handling. This in turn reduces the usefulness of the vast majority of the skills in the game.- Unfinished game. No cloakers*, no safe house customization, and re-used maps that are considered separate heists by the dev team.- RPG system, while a slight improvement over the first game, the amount of grinding one has to do to level up here is worse than the first game. Most heists are useless after reaching around level 40. The first game had a similar amount of grinding, but each heist felt more balanced in experience.- Card drops, this has to be one of the worst additions to the game. Frustrating to all hell. Make the attachments just cost money directly and don't have the need to get the card first then pay to put it on the gun.- NO ORIGINAL HOXTON VOICE ACTOR ****-*** The asinine amount of money that almost everything costs. Want to put on an attachment on a gun? Well that'll be 300K, effectively several heists. Oh do you want to take it off and put it on another gun? 300K more please.To sum it up succinctly, Payday 2 had the potential to be vastly superior to the first game in nearly every way, the devs however I think rushed to ""complete"" the game and really didn't test things out properly. The plethora of smash and grab heists only adds to my disappointment. Truthfully, I would like to see a Payday game that had the length and detail of the first game in terms of heists and the gunplay, weapon customization and stealth aspects of the second game.*Edit 2/12/2014: It's nice that they finally added cloakers after many months. The rest of the problems still stand.**Edit 2/28/2014: Goodness me, I didn't think it could get worse, but with the latest patch, they seemed to have nerfed stealth tremendously. They also punish people from playing the same heist over again, as if the grind isn't already awful with the Call of Duty style prestige system (I know it's technically infamous, but lets call it what it is.) I think ultimately, the developers really have stopped paying attention to the community and regreatably have ruined this game completely.***Edit 6/22/2014: After taking a long break from playing this game, I returned to it and played all the missing DLC missions up to and including the new 7$ DLC. Suffice to say many of the things I gripe about in the above review still hold true. While the heist for the new 7$ DLC is something I would categorize as ""good,"" the vast majority of the missions are still very mediocre, stealth mechanics still suck, the grind is god awful, and not having the ability to play whatever mission you want is highly annoying. After being out for 10 months, I would still not recommend this game to anyone, even on sale. The plethora of paid DLC that basically amount to micro-transactions coupled with the broken game economy really tells the whole tale of the game, one that was crafted to make people buy DLC to get more of the full game and for them to spend hours grinding. I also find it rather pitiful that one has to pay 7$ to get the quality of 1 heist that was essentially what Payday 2 should have been full of. If you want to play a heist game, Payday 1 is something that I would recommend, a game that has character, great missions, and a grind system that doesn't suck.**** Final Edit 11/14/2014: I've played this game since my last edit, where several additional DLC packs were released and a new heist, and the John Whick character. The Hoxton Breakout Heist is probably one of the worst heists in this game. I didn't feel like it was a breakout at all, and the polish on this heist felt very poor. Yes it was a free heist, but I find little point as it was such a terrible attempt at what could have been the best heist of the game. Honestly this point after a year+ of this game, the asinine amounts of DLC and no great heists besides the 8$ Bank Heist, I cannot recommend this game in any sense. I had pre-ordered Payday 2, the career criminal edition and ultimately I find much regret in that decision. Overkill has dissapointed me with their design decisions and never really reaching the quality of the first game. I will be very cautious of buying any Overkill game in the future, and certainly will not pre-order anything from them until they turn around their game design decisions."

The combination of both free DLC AND paid DLC*Why can't it all be free?4. Making the game last longer by adding in artificial grind instead of more new heists*A couple patches ago the devs introduced a new mechanic called ""Infamy"", which essentially raises the level cap (yes, this game has levels like an RPG) from 100 to 500. Best of all, they even said they haven't finished the system yet, because they're still deciding on what benefits to give levels past 501 before they put it in!5.

How the hell do you justify this in any way? These don't fit the game at all. Might I add that having to pay money for another drill to open a safe, of which if you go to thestill non-customizable safehouse,is in the garage? Oh wait, this one isn't painted somewhat. Can't be used! Isn't this fun!?Overkill, nobody, literally, nobody, thought ""I wish Payday 2 had an economy!"" The most we EVER wanted to the ability to trade masks and weapons to other people, especially if we could sell it for in-game money. Instead you took the more Corporation approach, removed the fun aspect of this, then had real money involved, and from there, it was all downhill.Wait, how is this free, and how is this obtainable to everyone?Now, the next problem, is that this is supposed to be a free update. As in, everyone will be getting this and have a chance to get it, for free. As in, no DLC, nor Microtransactions.Right out of the gate, they add TF:GO, something no one liked, nor wanted in TF2.Even better, the other part of this update introduced weapon rebalancing, which they did poorly, but it's worse when you realize that this was the only other part of this update. So, you mean to tell me you had more interest in making money than our interests!? What are you, a modern day gaming company!?What do you mean you only see me as a friend!?May I remind you that Crimefest is a Community Driven series of free Updates?As in, we worked for this? This was supposed to be stuff the community wanted? And immedietly, right out of the gate, they want to shove more ways to milk this game, and tell us ""You wanted this! You worked for this!"" with no explaination as to why you decided to use this update for more ways to milk me dry of money?What a way to start, hey, wanna start the next crimefest by canceling Firefly Season 2? Because now I'm disinterested in your games/Crimefest. You figuratively took a ♥♥♥♥ inside my computer to start this crimefest, you burned down my childhood home with my childhood dog in front of me to start this crimefest. You ran over my grandma with reindeer to start this Crimefest. And youKNEW,this was going to happen. Isn't that like going to a person who just won the lottery then kicking them in the ♥♥♥♥, them falling over, then proceeding to kick them in the ♥♥♥♥ some more?Then stealing that ticket.What I'm saying is, we're all pretty much not in the mood for Crimefest anymore, and honestly, would prefer if it was cancelled, this update to be modified/removed, then you never touch the game again. If this is the direction of not only the game, but the Community Driven Free Update ""Crimefest"", where they really aren't free, and our efforts were for not, and they're only there to benefit you, then I'd prefer if you never touched the game again.The game is fine on it's own, just let it live on it's own now without ripping it's utters off. You don't need to work on it for another 2 years either.Oh and if you're a completionist, now you're going to have to pay out of pocket, for a game that doesn't need this cashgrab that no one wanted, in order to 100% it.Let's be honest here...Overkill, we sat through your artificially raised pricing for your buggy/lackluster DLC because we trusted you, and we wanted to ignore that blatant fact and enjoy the game.In order to get the full experience, you need to pay over 120$ mind you there is no Season Pass of any kind. Of which is sort've a thing for people like Overkill who can't help but premature eject 5$-7$ DLC every month.What I'm saying is, we were willing to look past the bugs, look past the milking, look past the artificially high pricing, and trust you had our interests in mind.Now though, we don't need to look past it, and we have no reason to keep lying to ourselves and others. We don't see you as ""buddy-buddy"" anymore.Payday 2 is mediocre. The Free updates you release, are mediocre, the DLC you release, is pretty much the same situation. Except with artifically high pricing.And let's be honest, that's the truth. We denied it for you Overkill. But once again, you show your abusive Spouse side and make us lose that trust. Once again.Is there something more to this?Think about it, PD2 is going to be F2P for 10 days, but first they added Microtransactions like in TF:GO? Is this supposed to be manipulation? No doubt, people are going to either assume they own the game now, and think ""I should buy some skins, they're only 2-3$"" Then come to realize that they don't own the game. Even if that's not the case, it's a completely real fact that this is manipulation of the uninformed.Since it's ""normal"" for F2P games to have microtransactions, they're going to blindly accept this ♥♥♥♥, without realizing they're going to need to pay for it later. And if they don't, it's even worse since that's even harsher manipulation.One side note, Goonmod was already capable of making skins for your gun, just like you would for your masks. And you could make some pretty good ♥♥♥♥ with this. Now, BLT and Lua don't work. Hmm? That's annoying. The only way to get my skins now is to go get Overkill's mostly 2 Tone skin with a single logo slapped everywhere. Or even better, a skin that's literally 1 texture. Yeah that's totally worth my time and money.Compared to what I've made, these skins are like a kid used the gradient tool inPaint.nethttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=489631915http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=484199053Unoriginality makes the bandwagon go round.I'd also like to point out, that these Microtransactions are legit, becoming a thing now. As in, they are going to be apart of this dying gaming industry. The newest Tomb Raider game will have over 300 Micros, and there's a few more that will as well.Once again, Overkill, decided to childishly, with no regard for anyone else but themselves, add this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, because they didn't want to be original. They want to jump on a bandwagon because it makes everyone money. What they didn't calculate, is that they don't have the rep Valve undeservingly does, they can't get away with this. Because now, we're not accepting mediocrity. You haven't done ♥♥♥♥ to deserve anyone's trust, nor did you in the first place, here's looking at you Safehouse customization.You think your game is worth 120$ + Micros? Well then, prepare for it to be ♥♥♥♥ on, since no one agrees with you. Your game is still buggy and unoptimized, mostly due to the terrible choice of an Engine. You pull the same tactic as every other company, where you basically sell ""The other half of the game"" DLC. Then you spit on the face of everyone who worked for this free series update, that we seldom get, let alone, seldom get anything higher than 5/10 quality. And you thought this was a good idea to start with? It wasn't. I'm not buying, nor play any of your games anymore. Even if this update is removed, I honestly, don't care. You offered me nothing for years, then proceed to offer me even less."

Payday 2 almost always descends into Killing Floor style holding out, and Killing Floor does it better. The 'tons of guns' available are mostly useless, which means you'll be using the same load out over and over again, there isn't much variety of enemies, and almost no variation between playthroughs of each mission. Add this to the microscopic maps you're playing on, and the whole thing gets pretty stale fast.And, let's be honest, the way they're rolling out DLC is just slimey.

But in order for the community to receive these features for free as I recalled, they have to do a set of challenges that every player in PD2 must do to uncover clues for these said twelve rewards.There were challenges related to Twitter which is...dumb as they say which were later changed to proper in-game challenges and there were times where players grind the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of one of these challenges such as repeatedly speedrun a Jewerlly Store to achieve the 'high amounts of money challenge' (One of the easy & short heists of the game which is why they repeatedly speedrunning it) hoping the effort of doing this said grind is really worth it.What was the problem?At the time of the event, we've been given rewards that are either magnificant (such as the Payday: The Heist map remakes) or extremely notorious which are the weapon skins that cost actual money and players deemed that they're 'pay-to-win'. These were the microtransactions of Payday 2 that disgusted many players of the community, it's just atrocious.Would you rather buy a DLC packed with a heister or a map with a couple of unique weapons or a microtransaction where you only get one ♥♥♥♥ing weapon with a colourful skineven thoughthere's a mod that allows you to make your own skinned weapons titled as ""Goon Mod"" which existed even before the Black Market Update - the name of the first day of Crimefest. Just imagine that many players spend their time doing challenges for Crimefest only to receive something that the majority dislikes which is the microtransactions, it's just frustrating if you think about it and not to mention that Overkill originally said that they won't add MTs years ago so that was disgraceful to see them lied to our faces.There is some speculation that 505 Games (publishers) are behind this scheme.How did it got solved?As time goes on as Overkill tries to fix their relationship to their own community, they finally got most of the players back including me because in the 100th update: They announced that they own all the rights to Payday 2 from the publishers 505 Games and they're freeing up the Black Market so even though they didn't fully remove microtransactions, at least they're no longer pay-to-win and the rest of the future safes (similiar to TF2's crates and CSGO's cases) will be available to be unlockable at the start so no drill (key) will be required to unlock it, you can just open it once you received it on your payday so everything should be okay right?Almost, it's still a walking billboard (advertising other games/movies with crossovers occasionally), they haven't gave the Completely Overkill Pack owners the secret present that they deserved yet (but they are working on it), Infamy is questionable(?) and a couple more issues but does that make Payday 2 a bad game?Of course not.The gameplay is very enjoyable and you can mod it to your will without affecting other unmodded players, go ahead and play it with your friends.OMFG TL:DR-Overkill dun goofed to Payday 2-Porbably because of partnership with 505 Games-Microtransactions issue has been addressed-Also free grenades for everybody :D-Infamy problem, COP reward delay, Advertising/Crossovers is still a thing-Gameplay is fun as hell especially with your mates-Payday Subreddit is a fun place-Modding community is healthy and active-Game is good-DonacdumYou should buy the game but in order to get most of the experience, at least spend a extra cash on DLCs otherwise it would be quite limited in terms of weapon choices, map choices, character choices, etc.The essential DLC you should purchase is ""Gage Mod Courier"" otherwise get Payday 2: Game of the Year edition while the sales are currently active."

Even though games like Killing Floor and some others are decent co-ops, what separates Payday 2 is that it is dynamic.  You can play the same heists, the same difficulty with the same people, and the results will always be different every game.  You can breeze through the objectives or get crushed by the cops - either way it's fun to play with 3 other players to strive completing the objectives.Perhaps the best part about Payday 2 is the mod community.  If mods did not exist in this game, I would've stopped playing it years ago.  I have around 20 mods installed, from aesthetics like background wallpaper to weapon modifications to, my favorite, difficulty mods.  This greatly enchances the number of cops, accuracy of the cops, and the aggressiveness of the cops beyond what Overkill designed.  This keeps the replay value high for me and makes me crave more, even though this game is almost 4 years old and approaching no more developer support.Most people will complain that there is too much DLC and that all of it together costs too much - which I completely understand.  However, if you have been playing PD2 since the start like me, you buy the DLC as it comes.  Why would you spend money on DLC for a game you would not play?  You wouldn't.  I must be the last of a dying breed when it comes to this game I guess, because I still love it tremendously, even after almost 4 years.

76561197970914745,Not Recommended,218620,18566578,"Posted: 19 October, 2015",all,Solo4114,"TLDR Summary:Don't buy it.  They added lame microtransactions with stat-boosts to guns that they nerfed in the same patch, after saying they'd never do so.  The company has pretty crappy relations with the game community, which could possibly lead to an eventually dead game for online play (no joke).  And map design for recently released maps shows a trend towards boring, tedious gameplay, rather than the inventive gameplay of early maps.Now then, the review proper.I have around 250 hrs of gameplay in this game. I  bought it in 2014, picking up the GOTY edition, which (mercifully) bundled the DLC that had been released up to that point.  On the whole, the game is entertaining, and has offered a variety of gameplay approaches, including stealth and straight-up action.  Early on, the heists were interestnig and fun (most of the time), and it was cool to plan different builds for your character (e.g. you could build a sort of ""tank"" approach, or a ""stealth"" approach, or a ""buff/debuff"" approach, etc.).  However, I cannot, at this point, recommend the game to new players for several reasons.First and foremost, the recent introduction of microtransactions is a major negative.  If all the microtransactions were for was purely cosmetic skins (a la TF2's hats), I'd think it's silly, but it would be tolerable (more on the silliness issue in a bit).  But the weapon skins also include stat buffs.  This also comes at the same time as a recent ""balance"" update which makes many of the previous builds on weapons far less viable.  Weapons' inherent and modified (through normal additions that randomly drop for free throughout the game) accuracy has been severely hampered.  These two factors, taken together -- a nerf to weapons at the same time as the introduction of microtransactions for skins that buff weapon stats -- is unconscionable, especially in a game that (outside of a sale) already costs you $20, and has almost $100 of individually purchasable DLC (again, at full price).  There's just no excuse for this kind of change to the game.  Moreover, the microtransactions aren't even for the actual stat-modifying skins themselves.  Rather, they're for a system similar to buying keys to open crates a la TF2.  You basically are buying a CHANCE to get the stat modifying skin, you can get duplicates, and you can also get a skin for a weapon that's actually a DLC one you don't even have.Second, the company's relationship with its customers is...pretty abysmal.  Two company representatives -- one the now-departed lead designer -- were on record as saying ""We will never add microtransactions to the game.""  As you can see, the company itself has gone back on this.  However, there have been several other lies, delays, and general mismanagement of community relations.  For a game like this, you aren't just buying the game itself.  The game is constantly changing and being updated by the company -- sometimes in ways you don't like.  But players have no choice but to accept the changes and keep playing, or quit.  It's actually closer to an MMO model in that respect, so ongoing community relations issues matter to this game more than, say, questionable game changes where you can simply roll back to a prior version.  That's not an option here.  In the wake of this microtransaction debacle, the company has remained largely silent, including failures to respond to media inquiries.  My guess is that they're just laying low and hoping this will all blow over.  I wouldn't be so sure.  My point here is that the current company managing the game is not the same company it was when the game launched, and basically is not that interested in maintaining and managing the game's community.  This is a dangerous step, in my opinion.  The game relies on peer-to-peer matchmaking, which means if nobody's playing, your only way to play is to play with bots who are dumber than a bag of hammers.  As community relations continue to deteriorate, it's entirely possible that the game will enter a kind of death-spiral as people continue to quit, to the point where it eventually is about as dead as, oh, Brink.Third, as I mentioned above, the initial maps you play are, undeniably, a lot of fun.  They showcase the potential for complexity in this game, and inventive map design.  However, recent map releases have all started to focus on a particular style of map.  Basically, it involves ""loud"" action-oriented maps (or maps where stealth is fairly difficult to maintain), followed by having to drag the loot you steal across a long stretch of ground under fire.  This is tedious and boring, and while the maps look kinda cool the first time, actually playing them is just, well, a drag (pardon the pun).  It appears that the inventive design of prior maps is now a thing of the past, and we're basically going to be relegated to flashy, but boring gameplay.  On top of that, many of the recently released DLC packs have taken the game in increasingly silly directions.  The Chivalry pack and Western pack added medieval and western themed weapons and masks, which really have no business in a game about robbing banks.  It's not uncommon to see people playing with increasingly ridiculous outfits and weapons.  Now, in the end, this is more of a ""flavor"" thing, and not really a game-killer to me, but it's basically like the addition of ""hats"" in TF2.  It took the core design of the game and made it that much more ridiculous.  That's fine in a cartoony game like TF2, but this was, at one time, a serious bank-robbing game a la the film Heat.  Your mileage may vary on this issue, though.For a while, I really enjoyed the game.  I can't deny that.  I question how much fun new players will have, though, given how much grinding you have to do in the game, and given that a good portion of the playerbase is really, really♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off about recent changes, and the company's response appears to be an indifferent shrug or simple silence.  So, yeah, at this point, I wouldn't buy it."

Cool mechanics, multiple ways to approach a heist, stealth and loud, multiple types of weaponry...And I can no longer recommend this game which I once raved about.I poured money into this game. Not including my account's PC purchases, I've easily hit upper-double-digits in terms of cost.I put $50 for the Hype Train with DLC, the COPack, and Hotline Miami 2:Deluxe Edition.I had so many ideas on how to rebalance the combat, how to improve the heists' RNG, how to add new mechanics. I became active on the forums.But, after all the lies and inability to address the problem, Overkill has stolen this game from me.I can look back, and realise just how many issues I plainly ignored because I loved this game. Game-breaking bugs, terrible optimization, brain-dead AI, a useless skill tree, a lack of ""real"" content, and more.Many of these were changed or improved, but far too many over the years.I left the console version because they refused to support it. I paid for access to Safehouse Customization and 30 unique heists.Nope, dropped the support on that one.I'm STILL waiting on the Safehouse Customization for the PC version, which was described as beingcompleted before release.I also bought this game knowing that there would be ""NO microtransactions ([and shame on me for thinking that they'd stoop that low!])"".Shame on me?But worst of all? The Completely Overkill Pack.$20, 4 masks, ""It isn't a donation"" DLC with a secret item coming later. A secret, exclusive, cosmetic-only item ""crafted with love and care"".It pretty much failed every point there.I tried to refund itbeforethey released the secret item, after they went from an unknown amount of time after several months to the end of Crimefest, to a week after Crimefest, to another week after Crimefest.Refund denied.Or the fact we had to work and grind (which raises the overall play time, which they count on their quarterly reports ;) to unlock access to the ""FREE"" paid microtransactions.When faced with a MASSIVE backlash, they lied and shifted the blame and refused to acknowledge where the problem came from. ""Players seem to be loving it, statistics say otherwise!"", ""All the media is nothing but clickbait!"", ""We're sorry, we messed up, we'll fix this, but we're not going to say HOW or WHAT we messed up. We messed up on how we presented it, not the fact it was an immoral, nearly illegal action""When faced with the massive backlash Day 1, they waited. Complete and total radio silence.""We just wanted everyone to calm down! Be rational!""and by doing that, they made the changes irreversible.They don't care about their community anymore. They can barely listen to their own forum mods.All they care about is money.Which they won't use to fund Payday 2. They'll use it to fund their8unrelated, multi-million dollar (each) projects.Just stay away."

It's a good way to pass the time if you have absolutely nothing better to do.HOWEVER. Recently, they added a crate and key system to the game, similar to TF2, DOTA 2, and CS:GO. The only difference, is the weapons you unbox are direct upgrades from anything you can buy with the in-game currency. This adds a very ""Pay-To-Win"" feel to the game which is something they said they weren't going to do, and something that is extremely unfair to people who can't pay real money. The only thing that stops it from being directly ""Pay-To-Win"" is that you can find both the Safes and Drills (Crates and Keys), but the drop chance on them is so small that it's easier to just buy them.My over-all view of the game is this: Don't play this game UNLESSYou have a decent amount of money laying aroundYou are OK with broken AI and strange pathing/animationsYou want to support devs who lieOtherwise, just stear clear as the majority of the community is pompous d-bags who will kick you from the lobby the second they see you aren't at least Infamy level 1."

For goodness sakes the newest patch made Payday not recognize your keyboard (I myself was included in this glitch). Add that with cops glitching through walls, heists that glitch key parts of it, etc and you've got a game that you shouldn't waste your money on.

,Not Recommended,218620,29081121,Posted: 6 January,all,lol,"Look how many hours I have in this game and try to come up with why I'm giving this game a bad review.#1: The DLCFirst off, I'd like to note that a lot of the earlier DLC's were very good and added some extremely fun things that made the game have more replayability. Having said that, Overkill decided to add micro transactions for the end of their yearly Crimefest ordeal. That (for me) was the start of their decline. After that they started adding a new DLC around once every 1-2 months. It would've been fine but they decided to start adding useless characters and boring heists (selling them seperately I might add). They would add weapons and perk decks that were always overshadowed by older weapons added in previous DLC's and updates. They would often sell the character pack (which is typically one new character that adds nothing to the game, about two masks, one or two weapons, and maybe a perk deck) and the heist (a complete heist which was alright if you forgot you dropped about seven dollars for something that you'll probably get bored of within a few days) which would be all well and good if the character pack and the heist weren't sold seperately at pretty high prices (about five to six dollars for each pack).#2: The EngineThe engine they used for this game is way too outdated for the stuff they try to do. I've noticed quite a few more crashes more recently compared to just last year.#3: The CommunityOverkill almost never responds to any of the community. Nobody wanted the micro transactions and it took Overkill months to realize that maybe making people pay for dumb aesthetic things that they could easily just mod in might not be the best idea.How Overkill could fix these problems#1: The DLCEither bundle the character packs and the heist packs together for a small decreased price (like maybe the Scarface heist and the Scarface character pack and bundle those for about eight or nine dollars. I know you would get a bit less for each purchase but a lot more people could buy it and maybe doing things like this might grab the attention of older players like myself). You guys could even still sell the character packs and DLC seperately but just make small deals on the forementioned bundles. For the microtransactions, things are a bit more tricky. You wouldn't want to completely remove them as there are probably quite a few people who have paid quite a bit for certain skins and keys and safes and all that. What I think you guys could do about the microtransactions is add more rare ones (did I just say add more paid microtransactions? Yes. Yes I did). What I mean by this is add more of the excedingly rare ones that change the whole model. I know it sounds like a dumb Idea but I do think it would make people a bit more excited to buy a key and open a safe for the chance to get that 1911 with a skull on the end of the barrel that they've always wanted.#2: The EngineJust update this damn thing. It might be a bit hard but I know you guys have some smart people and you can find a way around that.#3: The CommunityIf you take a mod from a modder and just throw it in with barely any changes, credit them. If the entire community is angry at you for doing something, then don't do it again. I get that you guys are a business and you exist for the sole purpose to sell a product and make money but at least add things to that product that people will enjoy.Overall, this game used to be very fun but it has significantly dropped. If you are a big fan of first person shooters with very challenging and hectic gameplay and you don't mind dropping fourty or fifty bucks plus however much the next overpowered DLC is just to make it playable on those higher difficulties, I'd say maybe go for it. Other than that, I would not reccomend this game just yet. Maybe if Overkill starts doing better, I'll change my review but until then, I don't think I'll be playing this game for a while."

Very free!As of writing this review I can't be sure about the Bonnie character pack and the Hoxton Revenge Heist.. It is worded in such a way that would make you believe it would be free. But with the reputation of overkill, I would not be surprised (Look what they did with Butcher Mod Pack).Now lets remember, to unlock these 'rewards' the community has to pay for DLC. Which means, this event is literally buy DLC to unlock more DLC that everyone can buy themselves. It is for this reason, that many people I know who play this game simply download a trainer and unlock everything for themselves without paying (I don't personally agree with this and have never done it, but I can really see the appeal).If you think all of this is okay, you probably shouldn't have the money in your wallet anyway - because overkill needs their Payday 2.P.S sorry for that joke on the end but it's ♥♥♥♥ing TRUE."

Safes were later made free so it isn't a big issue anymore. Then a year later, two new difficultys were added, MAYHEM and ONE DOWN, in Hoxton Housewarming Party (basically CRIMEFEST III). I got to say, there was no reason to add MAYHEM, because its just DEATH WISH with enemys which have got less health. ONE DOWN describes itself, you got only one death untill you're grey (NINE LIVES counts so you get 2 downs) and the enemys were made 4 times stronger and deal 4 times more damage (ZEAL TEAM).RecommendationBecause almost everyone added PAYDAY 2 when it was free, I'd only recommend to buy the Ultimate pack when its in sales, otherwise you would waste your money and only when you genuinely enjoy the game..."

First of all, this game is AMAZING in the beginning. The feeling of the thrill of doing a new heist whether it be parachuting from an airplane or simply tying up a hostage is just overwhelming in the beginning. The gunfights are intense and there is a variety of enemies. This all help contribute to the pros of the game. I would give my left nut sack to be able to experience the thrill of doing a single bank heist now. But like all good stories, there comes what I would like to call POINT BREAK.After POINT BREAK the game seems to be a drag. It loses the element of shock and awe. Sure, all maps are ""randomized"" but seriously, they are just small things like security cameras and what not. It's not the same feeling as before. Plus, when your playing co-op online with random teammates, this is the point where you realize that the goal of the game is NOT securing the bags into the escape van but rather running around and trying to get the most kills as possible. After this point, your just constantly farming for exp and trying to get to a new prestige (it's called infamy in the game).So overall, yea I would say this game is great to play with friends online for a couple of rounds. But it is not a game where you can spend hundred of hours on it. I already regret the time that I have put into this mother♥♥♥♥ing game."

No stat boost from cosmetics. Ever.I’ve played Payday 2 since Beta and bought the Criminal Career Edition. I knew I was paying more in order to support Overkill. I wanted to show my appreciation for continuing the franchise. This game wasprofitable before it even released, and that’s the kind of success I hoped would mean we would have a long development. There have been multiple instances with Payday 2 where I believe that I got my money’s worth a long time ago. Having said that, many things went wrong.The GoodThe gunplay is satisfying. Vanilla didn’t have enough variety to make unique builds, but two years later you can choose between shotguns, snipers, pistols, LMGs,mini-gunand other fun weapons that give you the option to create your own setup. There has been a recent change in weapon stats, so the current state of the “best” version of each weapon is up in the air, but at least the dominant weapons are out of place.There are five skill trees to choose from and any combination can produce a tank, DPS, or support role. Specialization is generally discouraged as hybrid builds tend to achieve more skills that cover the weakness of a particular build, but specialty builds are relevant. Maybe you’d like to wear heavy jackets with high health/armor regeneration, or maybe a glass cannon that sprays death with revolvers or akimbo; perhaps you just want to blow♥♥♥♥♥♥up and bringing C4/RPG/Grenades is your thing. Regardless, there is no Jack of All Builds and you’ll find yourself experimenting to discover build archetypes. It’s fun coming up with your idea for build, then refining it to suit your needs.Heists are too short if compared to the first game, but I feel they are varied enough in their objectives. Each has their own atmosphere to play in and the music is built to fit each level. Some tracks are better than others, but that’s up to the user. If you’re not cutting a giant hole in the middle of a casino, you’re breaching an impenetrable vault with the big♥♥♥♥♥drill. You should probably seek to befriend heisters that do well with you. Grouping up is going to save you the hassle of pubbing and the lack of control you have over people’s performance.The BadRepeated lying on features. Repeatedly failing to deliver on other platforms. Breaking promises.It’s probably not fair to judge the game from its release state, but it should be noted that the Beta was a mess for consoles. Technically people could play the game early, and it was fun exploring ways to break the game in order to balance changes before release, but this situation was favorable only to PC as they were the only ones who could play and receive bug fixes quickly. Console players that bought the game for release got disks, which wereburned with the Betabecause there was no way for Overkill to release a Beta on PC in order to fix things, then burn the disks on time for consoles for release. Console players paid for Beta as a retail release; they had to wait for a patch.Overkill’s treatment of consoles, at least for the XBOX 360/PS3, has been atrocious. It’s true that the first patches started rolling out3 monthsafter the fact, and fixed many things from PC testing. This trend never changed and patches were few and far in-between. When pressed for information, Overkill excused themselves as being “too small” and patching console to be “costly”. I still give them benefit of the doubt about the cost part, but can you imagine paying for the same product and being told to wait while everyone got their♥♥♥♥♥♥first? The part that gained ire is that they started to produce DLC while dishing console patches. It’s fair to assume that at any given point, Overkill can develop both DLCs and patches, but how come resources are poured to releasepaid, but fail to deliver on fixing problems within the game. Console were being continually lead on that they’ll get something “soon”. They promised to treat console better and on February 26th 2015 they announce that development for the XBOX360/PS3 was terminated.We hate this too, because there’s nothing we can do about it., which meant some customers were not valuable enough for them to continue working with them. But hey, at least you get a 25% to pre-order the game for the XBOX1/PS4.The worst thing that drags down my faith in the company is the inclusion of microtransactions afterexplicitly promising not to do so. I mean the microstransaction system using crates/keys from TF2/CS:GO. DLC content bothered me, but I accepted them as necessary for the ongoing development, so I’d buy them to support future content. But this was betrayal and a revelation that the company sees its customers as money bags.  This would have never been a problemif the microtransaction skins you can unlock with real money didn’t affect in-game stats. That’s the biggest issue I have with this system and the reason for this review. No shame incopying a systemand failing to adapt it to the needs of their user base. This game was not meant for microtransactions because its infrastructure doesn’t work around it. Sure, the skins are cosmetic and that by itself would’ve been alright, but charging money for stat affecting skins; never mind that yourandomlyreceive them, so you have no control.Wonder why the older console generation stopped being updated? I wager my own impression that they couldn’t patch it fast enough to release the DLC on them as they could on PC, so they dropped them like a wet noodle. They couldn’t profit enough from them, despite having the long term goal to developer on them in the first place, but it was more feasible to abandon them.Despite my review being negative I still recommend this game to anyone that wants to play; it's fun no doubt. If you’re musing on buying or waiting for a sale, I’d say the game’s worth any price for sure, but the value it's worth is up to you. Even the DLC that was release pre-Crimefest 2015 is ok to buy because that’s your decision, but just don’t buy into the microtransactions. Don’t feed them money that you’re ok with this. It’s the developers that suck the life out of their own game. I can’t support a developer who lies to its customers."

Its unique and me and many others have spent hours into it.However, theres a few things you need to take in mind:1) Its a lot more fun with friends, teamwork and cooperation is very important and random people arent always the most teamwork orientated.2) The base game is very bland. Without buying any DLC, you will not have acces to the following:Shotgun ammo types, explosive rounds (or HE for short) being the most prominent and game changing one: they can stun every special enemy in the game, making them a lot easier to deal withSniper rifles: high damage, long range, and penetration, allowing you to shoot through shields and armorMost of the Light Machine guns: theres a free community LMG that was added, so you can use one but if you want the others, you gotta payGrenades, grenade launchers: explosives to kill groups and stun/kill all the special enemiesFlamethrower, molotovs: both provide huge area denial and crowd control, all behind a DLCDecent melee weapons: DLC melee weapons have the highest damage, the best DPS and there are 2 DLC melee weapons that have the ability to stun enemies. Standard melee weapons are kinda crap, DLC melee weapons allow you to go melee only if you build your character for itThe best gun mods: your guns can be modified with attachments, all the best attachments are locked behind DLCSome of the best perk decks in the game (sort of like a class mod thing) are DLCA large amount of heists are DLC: you can play any heist by joining it, but you can only host the heist if you own the DLC. This means that unless you have a friend that has the DLC, you have no reliable way of playing a DLC heist (other than hoping someone else is playing said heist, has a spot for you and its the right difficulty and everything for you)In short: you'll never see the end of DLC and every DLC is stronger and more gamebreaking than the last.3) They've added skins with stat boosts a la CSGO. Most players dont like them, if you have the money for them, go nuts. You can however get a skin for a DLC gun you dont own, so theres that.4) The game is heavily RNG dependent. To earn mods for your guns, or different masks or colors/patterns to customize them, you'll have to get them from card drops. At the end of every heist you will get one. There is no real way for you to get a long barrel for your AK rifle other than to be lucky. There are daily challenges you can complete that allow you to say you want a mod for your AK, but in the end its still RNG between all the possible AK mods.Its a great game, but if you dont have friends to play with and/or dont want to keep spending money on DLC's to be on par with the overpowered DLC user that just oneshotted the boss enemy with his RPG, I wouldn't buy Payday 2."

The root cause is the developer of the game Overkill software, and more specifically their lead developer Andrew Goldfarb. Everything done in development or since release for Payday 2 has been focused on slick PR, coercing players into buying DLC to help them advance, systematically removing as much fun as possible from the game, and breaking every significant promise they made to those that supported them in the move from indie mod project to AAA-level title, and as if that wasn't enough, they go out of their way to simultaneously insult paying customers who ask relevant questions or who have any type of complaint, legitimate or not.The last patch, the ""Death Wish"" patch, completely destroyed the game balance to pander to achievement ♥♥♥♥♥s (the 3rd or 4th time this has happened to date) and to give the appearance of the developer supporting the game above-and-beyond what is the norm. This is a standard pattern for Overkill, and nothing could be further from the truth. The 360 version of the game has never been patched to date. 7-day heists and safehouse customization, two important features promised for release, have never been added despite 24 patches and 5 pay DLCs. Every patch adds hideous new bugs and destroys game balance, while critical game-breaking bugs fester for months without being acknowledged, much less fixed. Hackers ruin the game regularly as it uses a peer-to-peer multiplayer model and relies on no master server, auth, or security. Overkill's answer to hacking? A pointless PR campaign that ""they care about cheating"" and a forum thread telling you to report hackers via email, but once explored is shown to be a total facade that wastes everybody's time as Overkill has no actual recourse to ban players or affect hacking in any way because of their poor implementation.Goldfarb does ban people, frequently and very loudly, from his twitter account if they are negative about the game or ask difficult questions, and why not? The man is a real hero and he wants you to know he stands for justice. The Payday 2 steam forums are full of trolls and sycophants, threads regularly disappear without warning, and there is a nasty little group of fellaters (players withcash.netin their name) that edit and remove posts as they please with no oversight or moderation. Through all of this, Overkill touts how they ""listen to the fans"", when the last 6 months of Payday 2 have proven to any sane person that not only do they NOT listen, they go out of their way to anger and troll their own paying customers. Examples of this are numerous: cameras added that can't be destroyed that say ""Suck it"" on them, special enemies that 1-shot you regardless of your stats/level/health while telling you to ""go to the forums and cry like a little ♥♥♥♥♥"", and even making the aforementioned special have an incredibly irritating fingernails-on-a-chalkboard high pitched whine that is constant, cannot itself be disabled, and is the very definition of 'tinnitus'. This last issue has caused thousands of players to quit the game or play with their sound off, and Overkill have not acknowledged how serious it is nor patched it. I hope somebody sues the hell out of them for it, I really do. It might seem like I've listed a huge litany of complaints about the game in this review, but honestly I've barely scratched the surface. There simply isn't room here to discuss the countless ways that Payday 2 has been systematically destroyed.Put it this way: Overkill is so petty that they had Valve arbitrarily (and in secret) remove the COMMUNITY VOTED top tag for Payday 2, ""Bag Throwing Simulator"", because most missions involve throwing bags repeatedly as you move them across the level while surviving L4D zombie levels of supercops. They also regularly remove fan posted material from the steam pages if it is any way critical of Payday 2 or Overkill. This rigorous, draconian, PRC-esque clampdown on all negative material indeed does give the game the appearance of being much more than it actually is. Don't be fooled. I've got nearly 500 hours in Payday 2 and it was once a very enjoyable (but seriously flawed) experience. These days, it's just insulting."

Time after time after time, Overkill (the developers of the game) will add new content and force it behind a paywall, to the point where the vast majority of content is locked behind DLC. There are almost twenty paid DLCs at the time of writing this review.However, the final straw came today, when they announced ""free"" content being released to the community. The first thing they did was releasemicrotransactions. On the first day of a ""free"" update. This is made even more outrageous by the fact that Overkill has said in repeated statements that theynever have and never will incorporate microtransactions of any sort into Payday 2. With the blatant lying and money-grabbing, I've lost all support for this game. If you want your money's worth, look somewhere else.2016 Edit:Recently, Overkill rescinded their microtransactions in a dramatic way: by completely removing the money cost of them.

,Not Recommended,218620,18752015,"Posted: 29 October, 2015",all,SSF1991,"Right. This will be a very long review.---GAME MECHANICS---First thing's first is the base game which is admittingly fun with friends despite being very flawed. Let me explain.This is one game that prides itself on DLC. I say this because you will spend more than double the amount of money you spent on the base game on DLC. You will not survive with just the base game and the user will very likely get destroyed with no mercy because of the sheer artificial difficulty of the game. Balance does not exist in this game. You WILL have to get DLC if you want to do good or have any items that help you stand a chance.Your entire team can get messed up by the special police units like tasers, bulldozers, and cloakers. Even if you've played 1,000+ hours of this game you and your team are at the mercy of the AI of the police if you go loud. A cloaker can take down an entire team in seconds. Tasers keep you from doing ANYTHING including defending yourself and you may get screwed over if a cloaker just so happens to target you while tased. Bulldozers, despite having a small hitbox that you can deal damage to, are actually the easiest. Why? Because they don't disable you from doing anything despite them having shotguns that can take you down in two hits so you can at the very least get out of the way.This, combined with many other flaws like glitches (enemies going through walls or the guards spotting you in stealth through walls or on the other side of the map is kind of unfair...this doesn't even count the horrible desync online that can allow you and your teammates to duplicate items), the very bad lack of balance in weapons (you will likely look to using the same 5 every time despite the amount of weapons added), the pointless armor that doesn't help whatsoever and just slows you down, the ""drill waiting"" snorefest you will encounter in nearly every heist, the repetitive bag throwing done in every heist, the increasingly boring aspect of the game you get as you play more and end up playing all the heists, the rehashing of maps and passing them along as new heists (Day 1 of Rats has been reused 3 times now including in a recent Halloween 2015 event)...it's very flawed. And don't get me started on the grind-heavy aspect of this game. It punishes you for everything. All except owning DLC. The more DLC you have, the better you'll do in the game as all the best items are locked in DLC.Did I say you HAVE to get the DLC? It isn't a choice, to be honest. 80% of content, including achievements, are locked behind the paywall of DLC.You will rage for all the wrong reasons.So why did I keep playing? Because it was fun with friends. You'll have good times with them. Playing with yourself or with strangers is just too risky. The game cannot be completed in solo because of the bad AI and overwhelmingly unbalanced nature of the game and playing with strangers? I do not recommend it. It is a hostile enviornment you will enter and it is just not worth it.That brings me, however, to another aspect of this game that I'd like to touch upon.---THE COMMUNITY---The community is very VERY hostile and divided and only on occasion will they band together (such as getting 30,000 people on the game at the same time during the Road to Crimefest 2015). Otherwise it's like two brick walls facing each other hurling insults at one another. They don't listen to each other, There's no mutual ground in between. You're either for Overkill (and called a shill) or against them (and called a whiny ungrateful brat, to put it midly without swearing). You may not feel welcome and it's why I've been a lurker in the community for so long. I'm not sinking my toes in a pool of shark-infested waters.This, like the game, didn't start out this way. But as Overkill's actions continued to build up the community just split in two. It's depressing.---EARLY DAYS---I remember when the game first came out. It looked so cool, so fun. I didn't have much money at the time so I couldn't buy it for a few months. It wasn't until late 2013, I think autumn, that I bought the game. Before I had the chance to play it my personal life got in the way, things happened, and I had to hold off on it for now.Even early in PAYDAY 2's life there was DLC coming out. DLC for the game in 2013/early 2014 was few and far between. It had lots of content. Armored Transport has many heists in it along with guns, patterns, and more. I bought it and by mid-2014 I had begun to play the game a lot more. Back then to grind for levels you did Rats constantly and V-100 was the max. ""Prestige""/Infamy didn't seem that big of a deal to me in this game as it felt like it was legitimately rewarding (Infamy 2.0 update changed that. Even bigger and pointless grind and no real rewards after Infamy 5 other then meh masks.).---THE TURNING POINT---I remember when stealth got tweaked. You had to answer pagers and there was only a maximum of 4 before it was ruined. This, to me, was the beginning of the pattern of ""annoying but no big deal in the long run so whatever"" moves that Overkill began to implement in the game.They also had started with the monthly DLC and now it had gone from heavy-content DLC that seemed to have effort put into it to 5-weapon DLC. Again, annoying but no big deal. The game was still sort of fun for me and Overkill seemed to be trustworthy. Then it became monthly. Why? No other company, regardless of how poor they are, does this! But that, as annoying as it was, wasn't the last straw. There have still been high points like Crimefest 2014 where the original character of Hoxton returned and that keep the wheels turning.I also started to notice that free things became more and more poorly implemented. The free/pay ratio was becoming very telling and it seemed more and more like Overkill was letting the game's popularity go to their head. Promises were broken (safehouse customizations were promised 2 years ago and as of this review still nothing, the Completely Overkill Pack item has still not released despite multiple reassurements that it would come out/release on this time window, and of course the determination to not use microtransactions), and the game became even more of a glitchy mess as DLC after DLC was chugged out while obvious glitches like the desync were ignored.It seemed like Overkill completely forgot what PAYDAY 2 was. They started putting out character after character no matter how unfitting they were to the game. There's two characters who are nothing more than collaborations (seriously this game is collaboration central). There's a character who has the most grating voice ever (I'm sorry Clover but your voice...wow) and another who is only there just because (Bonnie). What was once a game of professional criminal mischief has turned into an amateur frat party.My relationship with Overkill went from ""love"" to ""love-hate"". Things went downhill from there.---THE FINAL STRAW---Before Crimefest 2015, the Hype Train event from earlier in the year was bad. It was more paying funds for ""fuel"". If not for the heist that came with it (Hoxton Revenge) the event wouldn't have been great. And then of course Crimefest 2015 happened with microtransactions and, after the Reddit AMA that followed that was to me a giant ""screw you"" to everyone I was done.Do I recommend this game? No. Even without the microtransactions this game is very poorly made and unforgiving to new players. I was lucky to get into the game and ease into it. I probably wouldn't have been able to do that today and would've stopped playing. I'm very demotivated to playing now. I just don't trust this company anymore. Maybe I'll touch upon the game at some point in the near future but right now I just don't see that happening.It's sad to see a franchise that rose so well, fall so hard. Good luck to those that stick around though. In my opinion you'll need it."

Depsite this, I will NOT be changing my review. It saddens me that such a simple change will placate so many people and distract them from the real issue. Guns are still absurdly broken. Skins still change how the guns behave. The company blatantly lied and tried to see if they could get away with it. I'm personally not happy being bent over a rail and taken advantage of, nor is a little bit of lube going to solve my saltiness. And trust me, it has nothing to do with entitlement. I would've been just as happy if half the DLC and events for this game never took place. I know a lot of people are rushing back to their reviews to change them to positive, but sorry, this won't be one of them. These kind of business practices continue to go on because of how easy it is to calm the masses.Original Text: Welp, after years of back and forth BS, the true Overkill has finally revealed itself. As players leave in droves, the forums burn, and the Subreddit has taken to changing their banner, this game is now dead for a lot of people. Myself included. The constant DLC was enough to keep a lot of people on the fringe, but the DLC was never truly required to play. Sure you could miss out on the some content, but it wasn't world ending. The gameplay was there, the fun was there. So were the bugs. That have persisted through ""update"" after ""update"", while they still managed to have the time to ask for more money. Now, with this years Crimefest, and event which promises free content, kicking off with a microtransaction scheme that would make even Konami blush after what they did with MGS V, well, let's say this is one game that will never see a single byte of my hard drive space again.Good night, PD2. It was fun while it lasted. I recommend you stay far, far away from this diseased limb of gaming space, that once had glory and motor skills. Something else will come along to take its place. There are plenty of good co-op games out there, and coming out. Give them a look. If the theme of PD2 is what interests you, I'm sure something will come down the pipe someday to replace it as well. There are a lot of talented modders out there who cherished PD2, so who knows. Maybe they'll be the creator of the next great crime simulator, with perhaps less of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.Just a small edit, not that anyone will read this since all most of the people care about is that it's negative but, nonetheless: The reason I have 0 hours played in the last two weeks, is obviously because I haven't played in the last two weeks. I tried picking the game up again sometime after Hype Train and all it's wonderful loads of♥♥♥♥♥♥ but with Heist Rewards (XP/Cash) being lowered yet again, I saw no reason to play. Took a look again once Crimefest rolled around this year, and well.... Yeah, not really going to play a game focused around gun play, where the gun play now makes zero sense, and microtransactions have been introduced after I've already bought all the DLC prior to Hype Train.

Some of the other online games I play today suffer from horrible developers and lead designers, who take information that the community gives them and says “na, I like this better, these player just don’t understand”, for example a certain card game involving a commander of warsong. Anyway games tend to take forever to implement something that should or shouldn’t have been in the game.Now I’ve started playing Payday 2 on Xbox when it first came on the online store, finally when I got a pc I bought it on steam. The 2 years or so I’ve had this game I’ve seen it completely changed, for the better and worse, I remember the big stealth update where body bags were finally introduced, every single Crimefest, I remember the introduction of the dentist and being so excited for Hoxton Breakout, my friend and I stayed up one night trying to figure out who the rat was who put Hoxton away, and I’m still an active member today. I’ve seen the dumbest dlcs be released, but buying it anyway just to support the developers, I bought the completely overkill pack and the other one they released at the time for $25 total, to help the community with “hype fuel”.

This is too OP, how do they not listen to the community? Why is the developer so out of touch?” With Payday my questions are “Does Wolf have a brother, because of the description of The Grin mask? What are your next plans for this and that? When is the next AMA (ask me anything)”. The community and the developers are amazing and though they make mistakes they apologize and learn from the mistake. I give this game a positive review not because of the amazing gameplay, the variety of ways to play, but because of the people behind the scenes working day and night to make this game perfect. Thank you Overkill for being what every game developer should be.TL;DR: Payday is an amazing game backed by an active, amazing, and understanding development team. This game brought me hours of joy and I promise you that it will bring you joy too."

Especially the part about Microtransactions is important unless you like pay 2 win lottery in a paid title that also has tons of DLC.http://steamcommunity.com/app/218620/discussions/8/598199244886890714/It's also kind of convenient how they add skins that boost stats the same day they ""rebalance"" all weapons so that most of them are trash now, huh? Basically, it's like D3 before they removed the RMAH, just with tons of DLC. Oh, and it's not like all DLC is included in the GOTY either.Update October 25th, 2015: So there was a reddit AMA and the bottom line is, they just don't care what we think. The answers provided were mostly lies, half-truths, really weak excuses and more empty promises we've seen a hundred times over.

What a Pre-Order fest it's become and continues to be. At OVERKILL, we're humbled by the community response we've been getting. We're also strengthened - the positive feedback we've received means - more than ever - that we want to finish strong and give you guys the best Heist game we can.For anyone who's been cable tied in the last 36 hours, this is what's up;- PAYDAY 2 Pre-Orders hit Steam number 1 spot - all categories after only 3 hours.- PAYDAY: The Heist hit top 5 as well with a 75% discount that ends on May 30th.- We launched the teaser trailer for our PAYDAY Web Series coming this summer where you'll get to know our favorite career criminals a little better.The community forums have been booming. We read it all, we've listened and - in what I would dare to say is becoming a classic OVERKILL way - we've reacted.Let me explain.The Steam page for PAYDAY 2 has been updated based on your feedback. We've made it clear that PAYDAY 2 will have no micro-transactions whatsoever (shame on you if you thought otherwise!) and we've made it more clear that the PAYDAY loot bag is part of the Career Criminal Edition as well.We've seen countless questions about dozens of subjects, but there's been one thing in particular that people have been asking for.Due to popular demand, we're proud to say that we're releasing 4-packs of both the Standard Pre-Order Edition and the Career Criminal Edition - available right now. When you buy these, you do it to the prize of 3 - get one for free.That's a pretty good deal if you ask me. So make sure to get your friends convicted! I, ehm, mean, make sure you convince them to get hooked on PAYDAY 2!On behalf of the OVERKILL staff - thank you!Let's do this!AlmirProducer - OVERKILL - a Starbreeze Studio."

After the beta was over and the official launch happend on my birthday (pretty good bday gift at the time) I was so happy. After playing Payday: The Heist for over 100+ hours with friends I was so hyped.But then OVK sorta changed. They added DLC, alot of DLC. But I did not mind at all. more content is fun right? You don't have to buy ALL the dlc to have a fun experience. But after a year there just was too many DLC. I didn't want to recommend this game to my friends anymore because it was horrible to get started.I uninstalled the game around the Yakuza pack. I was sick of all the DLC with terrible features, no real updates, outdated voice lines, unpatched bugs etc. The game I used to love was just overrun with features it never had to have.Then they announced the Crime Fest 2, again, I got hyped. Reinstalled with a couple of friends and we played for hours. It was really fun again, but then the fest actually happend. We all loved FWB and Slaughterhouse ofcourse, but the skins.. it was kinda too much.The game is officially pay2win now, since you can buy Skins that improve your weapons. ''but you don't have a disadventage if you don't buy them'' while that may be true, OVk has become a moneywolf. You can't deny that. They ruind the game by including waaaay to much unecessary features.The game i used to love has become a DLC-fested monster. It has so much potential, but it's lacking it's core. it doesn't feel right. It doesn't play right. OVK ♥♥♥♥ed up one to many times.

Then there is the poor npc programming where one of your guys would be confronted by an enemy npc but neither would do anything for a short while as if they're thinking ""Is this guy with a gun, surrounded by bodies... a hostile?"" Meanwhile, the human players are either being shot to ♥♥♥♥ or in custody because the game director spawned a dozer on top of them while ""Tactical"" forces run in to the room like ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ islamic lemmings.Gold (in reality) is worth approximatly $400,000 USD per bar (11.5kg/400oz) but the mission payday makes it seem like we were stealing used porn as it requires two or three playthroughs on a high difficulty to even buy a good weapon.  Speaking of weapons, the DLCs you don't own are still downloaded on to your machine and take up several gigabytes in the process. However if you know how to, you can bypass the purchace process with a simple lua script, a good way to say ""♥♥♥♥ you"" to Overkill who expect us to spooge out money every time they release a DLC.  Also, who the ♥♥♥♥ blows up a bridge to steal a bomb?If Overkill really listened to its gaming community, they would U-turn their whole operation.  Seriously, I want to see a seven day contract where you pull off ""the crime of the century"" while also covering your tracks by moving or hiding the loot. However the chances of Overkill actually listening to what the community has to say is along the same odds as me successfully hitting a bank while bollock naked.If I had to choose between Payday 2 or being skull ♥♥♥♥ed by a dog who is drugged out of his mindl on PCP, I'd choose scooby doo any day.

The game is all about heisting loot from banks, mobsters, drug lords, warehouses, lock ups etc. The mixture of stealth and loud missions is a good combination allowing you to repeat heists without getting bored, so if you feel like sneaking around for a while or prefer to run around shooting people in the face, there is plenty of mission for both. The game is always been updated and new DLC always coming out, hundreds of achievements to collect and steam trading cards.However that been said the cost of all the DLC is now nearly triple the price of the actual game, they have now added in a 'black market' allowing you to get skins for guns which apply slight boosts. So all this does add up and if you want 100% achievements you need to buy all the DLC."

He seems like a fun guy, and he asks if you'll buy the first round of drinks. Yeah, I suppose I will, I want to get to know him.    So you buy drinks and he introduces himself, tells you that he's really into paintball and invites you to join him. Awesome!Fast forward a few months. DUDEBRO is a blast, you have easily 200+ hours of hanging out with him and he turns to you and says ""Hey man, you know I own a T-Shirt store? You should check it out.""   You decide, hell yeah! Sounds awesome. You look at his shop and see that it's all pretty cool, but very expensive for T-Shirts.Fast forward. It's been one year since you met DUDEBRO. You have a party to celebrate it and he brings you a gift. It's one of his custom shirts. Awesome, since you can't ever remember him getting you something before for free. You have a chat, good party and go home.This continues for three years. For every $100 you spend on his shirt store, he gives you a $10 shirt. But it's okay, he's fun, he's cool, and the shirts are a nice bonus for hanging out.Skip ahead again. It's a month before your four year aniversary. By this point you've spent a thousand hours hanging out and spent $150 on his pricy shirts. He seems to catch on that you're getting tired of him and are sick of buying his shirts for a 1:10 return ratio. It's getting harder to see why you hang out with him in the first place, but don't panic! ""I've got a great thing coming up, you're gonna love it, I just need you to help me move.""What???""Yeah, I'm moving into a new place and the housewarming party is gonna be WICKED! Seriously, you will lose your mind, it's gonna be so awesome... I just need your help moving my stuff in, you don't mind do you?""Is he finally going to really get you back? Are you finally after four years going to get the big payout for putting up with his bad side? Actually, yeah. ""We're still friends!"" you exclaim. ""What kind of friend would I be if I didn't help you! I'll get all my other mates to help out too, we'll have you moved in in no time.""Well skip up just a bit. It was hard, you practically broke your back moving box after box of T-Shirts and mini-fridges full of rocks into his place. (He forgot to take the rocks out before he made you do all that work, duh.) And while you and all your mates help move his stuff, he's been out. Whenever you asked where he was going instead of helping he would just say ""Oh, I gotta go do some prep for the BIG SUPPRISE! You're gonna love it!""Well finally it's done. Everybody meets up at his newly set-up place and waits for him to enter. Finally, he comes in the room with a HUGE crate.   ""Well, here it is everyone, I promised you ten awesome days of partying, and here we go.""   As he prys open the crate, you shiver with anticipation. What could it be? With so much build up this has to be amazing! WHAT COULD IT BE? AHAHHAHGGG!!!Oh. It's a vending machine.He bought a vending machine.Maybe there's more?""Yeah guys, check it out. It's a T-Shirt Accessory dispenser. For $2.50 you can buy a random accessory for my shirts, then you can trade them or sell them to each other. Isn't that great?

Since Deathwish, guards respawn if you 'kill too many' and I've had civs trigger alarms in rooms they couldn't have entered without being seen.

Overkill has completely ruined this game and gone back on promises of what the game was going to be. If I could get my money back at this point I would. Overkill's attitude towards their players is completely disrespectful and on occasion downright spiteful. I haven't played in months because I hit my limit long ago but I've kept up with the updates and seen the game get even worse. Somewhere along the line Overkill decided they'd rather money♥♥♥♥♥ than have a game that's fun because they already have everyone's money from when it was in beta and first released so they can do whatever they want to try to cash grab. In my opinion Overkill is a bottom tier game developer and should be one of the first victims of the cleansing of the video game industry.

It's a short story of my experience, please forgive my poor english and the ""first person"" description and point of view.I've played the game quite a lot, coming back to it every once in a while being sure to have a good time... But today things have not gone as i expected.Done a heist, got a strange ""safe"" card... shift tabbed... made some research in the forum... Microtransactions?The thing that ruined gaming has reached  this last ""safe heaven"" that was Payday 2?Cannot be... they told us it would not happen.The answer is found in Almir's words on a reddit discussion:""This is how it works: - In the in-game loot drop, players now can receive a safe or a drill - A safe can be opened by a drill which then generates an item that can be traded in the Steam Marketplace - Items are weapon skins, where some provide a small stat boost to the weapon its applied on - Drills, safes and weapon skins can be traded using the Steam Marketplace - From time to time, live events will allow players to get free drills and safes, and the item inside can then be traded on the market - Drills can also be purchased for 2,50$""So that is. I can now buy and sell ""virtual goods"" on a market for real money, while the developers take a cut for the service. It reminds me another long awaited game (that shall not be named, and no, is not CS:GO. The olders amongst you may know what i'm talking about) that had this exact same idea and failed... Badly.In fact, after paying for the latest DLCS i'm faced with this: spend more money to enjoy the new content, or frantically play during special events hoping to get a drill card.In a forum thread i've found that drills now drops too, but this special drop is on a ""weekly timer"". So, i pay today to (maybe!) get a bit of what i paid for after one or more weeks unless i pay more?That's unacceptable.The game is good, but this horrible marketing move made the value for money ratio drop to zero.Do not buy the game unless they remove the microtransactions or make it a free to playMy two cents."

For the longest time, the DLC was a hot topic of contention between players in the community. Some hated them, some didn't mind them. Starting with the crowdfunding event that was Hype Train, some of us began noticing a grim trend.This is what they were building up to: microtransactions in a $20 (formerly $30!) game with well over $100 of DLC,despite prior promises of never doing such a thing.

Defenders of them are now finding themselves in an uncomfortable situation where even many people who had defended even some of the most controversial DLCs are strongly against this. It doesn't help that the moderators on the forum are doing damage control on the forums by silencing a whole bunch of the negative criticism that inevitably winds up there, constructive or not.This game is an unbalanced, pay 2 win mess of its former self, and I regret every penny I spent on it. They killed the balance. They killed modding. They killed the game. And they will kill again. They don't care about you. They care about your money and using DLC and microtransactions to milk your wallet for all its worth.Many of us have sworn off PAYDAY 2, and I'm one such person.

I had my peaceful time with the game until that one update finally arrived and reintroduced the cloakers from the first game..Currently the full price of PAYDAY 2 is 20 bucks and its absolutely worth the money or any currency close to it. They added a lot of heists, weapons, equipment, mask and perks along the way and i'm sure they will keep adding more in the future.Here are aspects i like to point out including a TL;DR summary at the end.Online and Leveling SystemAs most online games its better experienced with friends, however i had great fun in public lobbies too. They can consist of:-Hosts that kicks you for no reason-Hosts that kicks you for not speaking their language-Hosts that kicks you because they don't have enough patience to let you switch to your stealth build once you join their lobby-People calling you a worthless sack of human existence just for screwing up something that they themselves have screwed it up in the past-People that even though it was obvious they screwed up a stealth part of a mission, they refuse to admit its their fault-Effort of doing 30-60+ minute long missions only to lose connection with the host like right at the end and afterwards you proceed to buy a new monitor-Low level people joining heists on the highest difficulties-Achievement ♥♥♥♥♥s (myself included)-RussiansYou also do not need to be concerned on reaching a level limit as every time you reach level 100 you can reset to 0 up to 25 times while each time it increases the chance of getting higher quality items at the end of the heist and more experience (alongside with new masks).You get to choose between 5 classes with each having 3 columns of skills to choose. You can fully commit to one or two classes or spread around multiple ones and be slightly useful in multiple situations.Unfortunately the game has a decent amount of cheaters that i believe it delegitimizes the players who reach higher levels without cheating. One can play 400 hours and reach the highest rank and can easily be just accused of cheating since most cheaters also have the highest level. However one can say that cheaters help you finish the missions faster and get faster xp and money since its pretty much only a coop game, but that's the point isn't it? They artificially exhaust your enjoyment for the game and it makes it worth less for the money you spent on it.Gameplay and InventoryGameplay is similar to left 4 dead but instead you are fighting an endless horde of blood thirsty cops that guns you down for equipping a pair of shades in a public store. Its exclusively coop and has special enemies that can stun you, drop you down, kill you quickly etc. The main objective is basically rob jewelry stores or banks or the usualassassination, robbing nukes, framing a government official, infiltrating secret mountain bases and blowing up radars and♥♥♥♥♥♥like that etc. just like what normal heisters would do of course.Alongside the usual killing, the game has a somewhat working stealth system that can be optional or even required in some heists. You will have issues on public lobbies as hosts far from you geographically can make the stealth part less enjoyable with the delayed detection and sorts. However if you're not confident on your friends or other public lobbies to do stealth heists, you can do them by yourself! Most, if not all stealth missions can be done solo without the concern of other people screwing it up.Of course in order to effectively kill cops in cold blood, you need a good weapon that fits your taste, and fortunately the game has loads of them to choose from. Each weapon can be customized to improve it a little or change it with lighter parts and added suppressors for a more effective stealth experience.DLC's and MicrotransactionsProbably the main reason i wanted to do this review, it used to be a negative review because this game some time ago added a system with microtransactions similar to CS GO that added weapons skins obtainable from cases (safes) and keys (drills) but the rare weapons could have stat boosts making you have a slight advantage over others that didn't pay.I believe they deserved this intense scrutiny from the community because if they were allowed to do these kind of practices, they would just step it up more severely with later updates since people allowed it in the first place. This way they got denied the first time and they learned from their mistakes. Its enough that they have an unnatural amount of dlc's released.They argued that even if one member has a slight advantage over the others through payed content, this game is coop only so it benefits the whole group. I don't agree, this shouldn't make someone feel like their role would be less of an asset knowing that someone else has the exact same version of his weapon but with a direct upgrade to it.Speaking of DLC's, as of today it currently has 42 DLC's (9 are free). I do not recommend buying them at full price however they are worth buying at discount (preferably at 75% off, 75+ cents for a weapon pack) since most of the weapon dlc's are not even that great, just a one time fun use and you ditch them afterwards (There are dlc's that will fit your weapon taste, for example a sniper person will play with the sniper dlc pack the most). The heist dlc's are not required for you to pay them, you can just join someone who purchased it and play it from there. The default weapons are mostly better than dlc weapons except a few of them that can be more useful overall.So yes to a slight degree it's pay to win, it has a few array of perks and weapons that could make your game more enjoyable and effective. The main substance is still the game itself, and some dlc weapons will not ruin the experience for you.One however could use the same argument i used on ""Not feeling like an asset knowing someone has better weapons"". While some DLC weapons are slightly better, they add a different playstyle and fulfills other roles and as a whole they can be better overall than default weapons, but they are not a direct upgrade to them, there are situations where default weapons can prove more viable.They made over 100 updates to this game, i let the dlc's slide because they constantly add new stuff for free and they update it on a regular basis, something that a lot of devs are not doing as well (hi evolve) . So even with their past decisions, in its current state i very much recommend this game for its current price, its a direct step up to the original and its a fine example of a good sequel.TL;DR SummaryYou can sometimes get safes (40-60 eurocents on market) as free drops.Mild pay to win content. DLC's are worth on discount preferably, and only a few of them are good for you depending on your weapon preference. Heist dlc's are not required as you can join others that has it. DLC prices can be compensated by selling your free safes.While a better online experience with friends, its not too bad on pubs either. Just the usual immaturity you get from most communities. You might have some connection issues and it can boot you off during a heist (i suggest filtering the closer people to your country to prevent it). I also experienced a few crashes but not during heists.It has cheaters, i suggest not playing with them as it reduces the amount of enjoyment time you would normally get.They learned from their mistakes and eventually listened to the community. They are active with over 100 updates that added tons of free stuff along the way.At its current state its worth the money. It has an amazing soundtrack and a vastly superior gameplay compared to the first game.You can rob banks as Ron Perlman."

Skill trees are fairly varied and allow uniqueness in builds. A lot of the missions are fun and challenging. Weapons feel good when handling and allow modification for a lot of diversity.The Cons: Grinding all day erraday. Game has a 100 level progression for skills and weapon unlocks, and 5 levels of prestige. Most missions give relatively low exp rewards, meaning you'll be running a whole lot of the same heists to level. Additionally has a huge cost for your ""offshore account"" , meaning you'll more than likely have to do some extra money grinding each prestige.♥♥♥♥♥♥ card system: All game rewards are given via a random card system, which can be: Exp, Money, Masks, 3 different mask parts, or a weapon mods. One card per successful missions means it takes a long time to get what you're after. The diverse array of weapon mods which are weapon unique means you'll get a whole lot of the part you're looking for for other weapons. Massively artificial extension on playtime at the expense of quality of life.Peer to peer matchmaking: Lots of disconnects and hosts you can't access. ""Failed Joining Game"" popup in matchmaking is a familiar friend that greatly overstays its welcome.Repetitive missions: A lot of stages or concepts are reusied. While unique hesits exist there is a lot of reuse of maps or repition across missions.Devs are ♥♥♥♥ing cockteases: new DLCs, free or paid, are teased for days for relatively no payout (three days of buildup for like 3 new guns and some knives yay)Bottom Line: Picked this up on sale with the DLCs.

You don't just blaze your way around to rob a store or bank, drilling the vault and escape. You need more strategy and planning in PAYDAY 2, which also make stealth approach as an option, and sometimes a primary option for most. Doing stealth is not easy, but you get a bonus for doing stealth. Teamwork are more encouraged in PAYDAY 2, especially on stealth approach.The police in PAYDAY 2 are more vary and some are even powerful, as some of them are technically not police, but FBI task force. In lower difficulties you may only meet the police and SWAT team, but in higher difficulties, FBI are your primary enemies. Dozer, cloaker, tazer, shield, they are making a return in PAYDAY 2.The upgrade system in PAYDAY 2 has also been changed and improved. Unlike PAYDAY: The Heist, you can choose skill tree and perks you prefer the most in PAYDAY 2 and has to focus on that as you cannot become everything, you have to be something for your crew. If you prefer stealth approach, you need to focus on the right skill tree like ghost, or if you like shooting people around, you could be an enforcer. Each skill tree has unique bonus, weapon skill and special equipment, but you are limited with what you are.Weapons in PAYDAY 2 are also more customizable, barrel, scope or sight, stock, magazine, laser sight and more. You can customize your weapons to suit your skill tree and perks, or just customize them to be something you prefer. Mask can also now be customized with patterns or colors to make yourself unique among other criminals.Graphics of PAYDAY 2 is far better than the previous, more detailed and more beautiful. With masks and weapons customization system and detailed models, they look so beautiful, making the gameplay so epic and making your customization even more unique. PAYDAY 2 performances are also good, despite sometimes I tend to crash.Overall PAYDAY 2 is an awesome game, made by awesome people, I recommend this so much."

The game was rather...Husky. It lacks core content, technically it lacks pretty much everything. Developers on the other hand? Haven't really been doing much, except ripping off modders work.Now let's see some example.The game was infested by cheaters / hackers. That's no surprise, but not all hackers are badies.1) Some of them actually made scripts to make in-game vechiles drivable. Which the developer originally claimed it was impossible due to game engine limit. (Now we have drivable vechiles)2) Community modders made a katana skin for a melee weapon in game. Months later? Developer added in a 'new' katana weapon, exact same model, with different texture.3) Community modders made a 3rd party website that allows user to check another user's game statistics. A whole year later? Developer implemented [FBI Files], that does the same damn thing, but with a flashier layout.These are only a few examples I'm listing, to sum it up. The developers have actually been doing the minimum while flat out ripping off what the community offered themselves. This even include some nastiest bugs and glitches the developer was unabled / refused to fix. It was thanks to the community, that someone wrote a code to fix the issue, THEN later on the developer implemented the user made code into the official build of the game.But enough of trashing the developers themselves. Let's talk about the game itself.Game contents? Well...Let's just say, if you aren't planning to buy the Game of The Year, or any DLCs at all. You'd be bored with the game in a rather hasty manner.People often describe Payday 2's community is toxic.

Instead of fixing bugs and glitches that has been in the game for ages, they put out DLCs. This year's Crimefest was nothing but lackluster and it was supposed to be FREE, then they added in skins because emone. Even though they CLEARLY said that they wouldn't put in microtransactions (shame on you if you thought otherwise!)And now they added in safes and drills into the loot drop, lowering your chances even more if you want to get an attachment for a weapon. The so-called ""rebalance"" is garbage, a pistol, a PISTOL will outperform an assault rifle. Almost all shotguns are near useless now, they put out damage per shell, not pellet like they should.Day 10 of Crimefest went out with a whimper, meme masks and jumping achievements. The community did all the challenges for some meme masks? What is this, 2007?On top of that we got a JUMPING ANIMATION too. A goddamned jumping animation that doesn't even look good.A jumping animation should NOT be in Crimefest, they should be in a regular update.Overkill, I'm disappointed at you."

Over time my friends and I realized that the game would not update, even though the PC version was updated regularly. Soon The Xbox version was practically abandoned by Overkill. At first I thought this sucked, but after buying and playing the PC version with friends over the past couple months I realized this was a blessing in disguise. The game was being turned into less of a stealth/shooter into just a shooter. I understand that the stealth should be hard however sometimes the sight meter increases through random number gen. Stealth with random players generally suck also, however we pressed on. I ended up being level 98 and then came the shameless DLC rush between the western pack until now. About at this point my friends and I started playing less and less as they continuously increased the difficulty to stealth missions. Crimefest was the last straw for me. When the micro transactions came with crimefest I decided to just uninstall. This game used to be good. The key term was used to. The fact that Overkill keeps trying to create more and more, constantly changing the formula, not in a good way mind you, to keep this game alive and try to keep it from being stale. This however blows up in their face when the game itself does not become more replayable through difficulty and skin packs. (certainly not microtransactions) Overkill needs to fix what they have while they can or more peope will end up like me, uninstalling.Final rating George Lucas/prequals"

Not only was the gameplay great, content was constantly pushed out extending the game's life. While there was some power creep with each passing DLC, it wasn't to the point of being unacceptable.Unfortunately, with the recent addition of the Black Market update, it has become unacceptable. Not only is it a direct copy of CS:GO's weapon skins system, weapon stats were also added to the skins. Each drill (key) costs 2/3 as much as a DLC pack which is outrageous considering the amount of DLC they've already pushed out. Yes, I know you can get drills through card drops but it's at such a low chance you might as well pretend they didn't. And as if to pour salt on to the already gaping wound, a weapon rebalance was released that not only broke a whole category of weapons, it was also balanced around the skin stats.It is really unfortunate that Overkill promised free content during CrimeFest, only to add microtransactions (which they also promised to never implement before). In response to the comminuty outrage, Overkill has done nothing but try to paint themselves as the victims of the fiasco. This goes to show the devs are willing to break promises and are unwilling to listen to the community's feedback. Well I guess money does triumph all.It's been a fun ride but I can never view Payday 2 in the same light again."

In less than a month a game that was my absolute favorite has turned to $hit.I loved this game so much that I purchased ALL the DLC's, I even bought some for friends.While there was much conterversy over the microtransactions, I didn't give it much thought. My mentality was don't buy if you don't want it. However, in less than a month I have noticed some very unfair game play. My DLC guns suddenly were very inaccurate and stability became an issue. It got to be to the point that my favorite weapon that I had used for over 450 hours was now useless. I suspect my gun would be ""improved"" if I made a microtransaction for a chance at getting a weapon skin and boost.The skin and boost are all random and so for what I use I could potentially spend hundreds of dollars on getting the ONE skin needed to make my gun work again.The new update came out and trying to play this game has become frustrating and almost impossible to play. Guards are now teleporting through doors and windows. They are seeing players from all the way on the other side of the map, which is really frustrating when trying to stealth. The lag on the game is horrific and it is almost a relief when the game crashes.A great game has turned into a pile of poo in less than ONE month and OVERKILL has no plans to address any of these issues.So to summarizeI paid for the gameI paid for ALL the DLC'sNow I need to pay for microtransactions to properly use the weapons I already paid forand the game is unplayable.I have had enough and OVERKILL does not get one more cent from me."

,Not Recommended,218620,19061135,"Posted: 13 November, 2015",all,KingDenniz,"I have played this game for a long time. I've seen a lot of updates come and go. I've played every single heist in every way possible and I have secured every single bag of loot. I've created 100s of masks and worn 1000s of them. I've done every achievement and played with 1000s of peoples killing a 100.000 if not 200.000 cops. I've supported OVERKILL by buying every single DLC and even defending them on Reddit when the initial microtransactions arrived. But what they have done now is absolutely preposterous, ridiculous and a huge insult to their loyal fanbase.On March 12th 2015 I purchased the Completely Overkill pack for €20! This was a DLC containing 4 of the default heisters' masks with a added particle effect and a secret bonus item. This secret item would be revealed later because it was still in the concept of making. As time went on I kept waiting and waiting for my secret item and it didn't come.Then in August Almir announced that we would receive it during Crimefest. This was a lie as we didn't get it during Crimefest because there apparently were complications with the item being released on Valve's end. (Notice how they blame another company for their incompetence) Yesterday, on the 12th of November 2015, exactly 8!! months later, the secret item was revealed. It was a new rendition of their microtransaction system. A safe and a drill. You would be offered the chance of receiving 1 out of 25 skins. That's not even the worst part, not being able to choose your skin. The worst part was that the skins also came in qualities. So it could've turned out that you received a skin you did not want, for a gun you don't use, in a terrible quality. So it would've turned out that you paid €20 for a totally useless skin.Whereas Overkill promised the following, and I quote: "" The secret item is cosmetic. It will not make you better than anyone else. This pack is for anyone who wants a way to support OVERKILL in developing the free Hype Train content for the community. Based on this, it's up to you wherer or not you want to purchase the pack. For those who support us, we're happy to give them four cosmetic items along with an additional secret item to be revealed at a later date. ""Note how they state it doesn't make you better than anyone else in-game. Whereas it does. The skins came come with stat boosts and team boosts. Stat boosts giving you better stats in-game up to a 5% increase. And a team boost being a permanent XP/Cash boost PER skin PER person. So you could end up with a 25% XP/Cash boost if all players where to have a Completely Overkill skin.Overkill has continously lied to it's entire playerbase and I'm sick of it. I will not return to this game untill they atleast adress or fix this issue.Even last week they promised us on an AMA and a livestream that they would be more transparent with us and wouldn't pull a MTX move like this. Yet they infuriated the entire Reddit and Steam once again. I'm disappointed in how all of this went and I doubt that Overkill can recover from this.Don't buy this game, spent your money on something else."

Whether or not you can get the same enjoyment out of it really depends on how often you can play with friends or some random trolls/hackers/people with a good view of their own colon.

I've had enough of this game, especially of the developers and it's time to change my review to negative.You want to know why? Sit down, I'll tell you a story.Once upon a time, the developers of this game before it was released, told that they will never add microtransactions (and shame on you if you though otherwise!)Proofs:http://i.imgur.com/tsY4bOY.png-http://i.imgur.com/Th4yPLg.png-http://www.gamespot.com/articles/payday-2-wont-have-microtransactions/1100-6410303/Two years later, in the update of the 15th october 2015, they added weapon reskins that can be took only through one way? Guess how? EXACTLY, MICROTRANSACTIONS! They introduced microtransactions despite they said they will not doing it. They lied for 2 years to the people that have supported them (and milked) until today! This is disgusting.Now you probably think that we are overreacting to this cheap marketing method, but I want to tell you more. Those weapon reskins that can be bought only on the Steam market, were introduced as ""FREE"" reward for some challenges were we grinded the♥♥♥♥♥♥ouf of them for 2 WEEKS, even if they said that every reward that we are going to unlock, are completely FREE. Now tell me, something that can be used only by PAYING with real money, has to be considered free stuff? Let me know.In addition, those weapon reskins, have STATS BONUS that increase weapons efficiency and most of them are reskins of DLC weapons, so if you get a reskinned weapon but you don't have the DLC of that weapon, YOU HAVE TO BUY IT!!! You have to buy more for using something that you have already bought!!! Isn't this ridiculous?Don't forget that those reskins introduced are copied from CS:GO and TF2, even the ""inspection"" animation in the first view!The difference? On CS:GO and TF2, the reskins are cosmetics only, can be dropped in the game, don't improve any kind of stat and both games are PvP. Payday 2 is PvE! This is called ""Pay 2 Win""!""But hey, Stefano, is the game F2P?""NO, IS NOT. The base game already costs 20€ and offers NOTHING, unless you spend your money by buying DLCs (which most cointain overpowered and Pay 2 Win weapons) that are over TWENTY-FIVE, and all of them cost over 100€!!!CS:GO costs 15€ but it doesn't have DLCs, and TF2 is F2P. There's a huge difference, as you can see.Another ""free"" reward of this event, was weapon ""balancing"" but instead of buffing them, most weapons were further nerfed by completely breaking the accuracy and recoil of most of them. The only way to buff them back to where they were before, is to spend even more money on microtransactions to have a CHANCE at fixing your loadout, otherwise, you have to deal with it!The only weapons that were ""buffed"" are pistols... buffed... they're broken! Most pistols deal over 100/200 damage, instead of 40 pre-update, have higher accuracy than sniper rifles, and they made the game even more easier and unplayable than before.This greedy/cash-cow milking attitude needs to stop, because the community had enough and Overkill is treating the community like a bunch of idiots, by saying a lot of lies and without giving answers to our questions. They are destroying an active community for filling their pockets with money, and they're inducing a lot of players at abandoning the game. They're so focused at making money, that they never fix old bugs, don't improve the AI, don't optimize maps and they keep ignoring a lot of feedbacks about stuff that was added for ""free"" (Infamy 2.0 and SWAT Turret, for example).Another example of lie from Overkill is the ""Safehouse customization"" which was announced before the game release and they told it was a feature present since the start. 2 years later, the community is still waiting! This, like the ""No microtransactions"" announcement, is called FALSE ADVERTISING!If you're going to buy this game, THINK TWICE!  The devs are mocking us. Don't take it!This game started as a robbery game, but now the real robbery is made by the developers.OVERKILL, you have to wake up! We dropped the Steam reviews from 93% to 81% in 3 days. We're not joking anymore. We need to get respected.EDIT: WARNING! The game doesn't start on Windows XP, despite the store page says that can run it.

It serves no purpose other than to make it impossible for new players to progress or learn the game.

With the safes, it's just like trying to win the lottery, chances are you're more likely to to win the actual lottery than to get a drill to the safes, and even then chances are, you're going to get a weapon skin to a weapon that you don't own (aka DLC weapons).

Steebterprise,"TL;DR I'm no longer playing because the game hasn't gotten better, not because I can't pay for microtransactions. Also, I haven't seen a jump animation that well executed since Mario Bros, 1985.Nearly 500 hours in, I've sunk plenty of time into this game and have enjoyed a good amount of that time spent. Haven't started it recently because my friends have mostly stopped playing. After reading several reviews, however, saying that I'm no longer playing solely because of microtransactions isn't accurate. I haven't played since July, long before Crimefest 2015. I'm no longer playing because there's no guarantee for a better quality of game. PD2 was fun because my friends and I could fix drills, move bags, and blow up meth labs together. Bane never shutting up was part of that fun, as was constantly yelling obscenities at them to keep the team going.My main issue is with the quality of their product recently: The amount of (optional) paid DLCs haven't been great, most just adding more (mediocre) firearms, melee weapons that don't get enough attention (intense melee action belongs in Skyrim, not a bank robbery), poorly designed mask materials/patterns/colors, and weapon-specific mods that make the new guns perform on par to any other gun in the game. Spending $10 on bad guns and $5 on a poorly developed character and an ineffective or blatantly broken perk deck (Grinder) is stagnant at this point. Their new heists aren't much different from the old ones, but at least now we have cars with bad driving mechanics and we can now fully understand why the getaway driver crashes so much. The heists haven't gotten more intricate, there still isn't a single heist that takes more than 3 days and the objectives are still the same: wait for the drill to break, wait for the rent-a-cop on patrol to leave for 5 minutes, don't split up, move the bags. Communication and cooperation isn't really necessary nor is it rewarded.Obviously, microtransactions I've got to harp on. We've had these for the entirety of PD2 thus far: Paid DLC. I know the difference between the two, but from a monetary point of view, there's no difference between if I pay $15 and get 2 DLC packs or get X safes and pay $15 to open them all. Technically, the DLC gives me more content, but if you refer to the paragraph above, the DLC they've been coming out with is substandard and thus I don't need or want to buy them. Enter shiny new safe: It has a skin. I don't have an interest in making my firearm purple and green or whatever, I'd rather it look authentic.These drills and these skins, though. They allow the devs to get more for doing far less. I'm not an animator, nor am I a modder, and I have no experience in 3D rendering, but lets say they make 10 skins. In order to collect all 10 skins, that has an absolute minimum price tag of $25, already nearly double how much the DLCs of the month costs. I'm sure it is much easier to make 10 skins to wrap a 3D model in than to make 5 skins for 5 new weapon models, each weapon having multiple sound files associated to it as well as animations for reloading and drawing, etc. Aside from that, they need to create more content, a new character model with their own skin and mask, and an additional perk deck, which costs (as said above) roughly $15. Which is more efficient from a developer's point of view?Unless they end up doing well with the microtransactions and are willing to put forth free DLCs from now on, I don't see PD2 fulfilling its promised amount of updates unless through technicality:http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/24/overkill-will-keep-supporting-payday-2-for-two-more-yearsIn summary, if you look at the poor quality of recent DLCs and the disinterest I've shown in the microtransactions, it is safe to assume that I've no interest in spending more money on this game. We've collectively spent plenty on the game and it hasn't gotten much better. We've spent enough time on this game to know that it won't get much better. The devs don't seem to care what their audience has to say about the recent changes, so though they may eat their cake, I for one will not be bringing them any more. I'll still be waiting for the Walking Dead game they're apparently making, but I will not be buying it upon release."
,Not Recommended,218620,23294602,"Posted: 30 May, 2016",all,122aina,"I'm going to preface this by saying this game has insanely anti-consumer business practices and you should not buy it under any circumstances if that's something you care about. The developers have done little to nothing to alleviate the concerns ever since the game first introduced their horrible microtransaction systems, alienating their entire fanbase in the process (EDIT: This has more or less been been improved by Overkill as of May 30th. See bottom of the review). Beyond that a considerable chunk of the game (15gb or so) is locked behind a paywall of 150€, making playing this game without buying ludicrous amounts of stuff crazy repetitive. Not that it isn't repetitive anyway.Just something to consider.With that out of the way you might wonder if you should buy it if you don't give a damn about dubious companies and their ♥♥♥♥♥♥ attitudes, you just want to play a co-op shooter with your friends. The answer to that question is still ""probably not"". These devs can not handle an original IP to save their lives. Here's my reasoning behind that.Exhibit A)The game relies heavily on being a grindfest for its replayability, with all of the positive reinforcement coming from unlocking new masks, ranks, achievements and weapons. That's not necessarily a bad thing. It becomes a bad thing because any meaningful sense of progress a player might've felt before has been removed on account of Overkill not caring enough to ban hackers who unlock everything at the press of a button - after all, hackers still pay Overkill. You might think that it isn't so bad, as hackers can't possibly be all that plentiful. You'd be wrong. Terribly, terribly wrong.Exhibit B)The game features a metric ton of original and good-looking weapons. All around, about five of these are viable alternatives if you don't want to be terrible. Making them assymetrically balanced is just too much work for too little payoff, innit Overkill?Exhibit C)The enemy AI is god-awful. I mean that. Instead of improving it to add challenge on the higher difficulties, Payday 2 chooses to stack damage and HP on them like it's christmas, making Death Wish heists a boring drudge instead of a fun challenge if you - god forbid - consider going loud to switch things up.Exhibit D)The matchmaking and netcode is terrible. The host has an advantage but the rest of the players are going to get shot when they are technically in cover and other such shenanigans. The matchmaking is unintuitive and slow, making sure that you'll be bored of the game before you've even started playing.Exhibit E)It's repetitive. By god is it repetitive. You can read about this in any number of reviews, so I won't go that far into it.TL;DRAll in all, this game is really, really bad whether you consider how god-awful the DLC and business practices are or not. Stay away from it. If you want a team-based co-op shooter to play with your friends that isn't god-awful, try Borderlands 1 or 2 instead. Just don't expect any amazing writing from either.In spite of all this, Payday 2 has a bangin' soundtrack. I mean that. Credit's due where credit's due.EDIT: Well, seems microtransactions have for the morepart been rolled back! Because the rest of my review still applies, I'll keep it to negative. If I could, I'd change it to a ""so-and-so"" score, but Steam hasn't added that.This is certainly a great thing. It's always nice to see the good guys win, and Overkill really seem to be promising some improvements. Nice job Overkill, with the free patches in mind my score may change in time!"

,Recommended,218620,24520129,"Posted: 25 July, 2016",all,Nicoleise,"Payday 2 has been around for almost three years at the time of writing this, and I've been playing pretty much from the start. I've never reviewed titles on Steam before, because I haven't felt like they warrented a review. This does, I think, mainly because the developers are awesome.If you're a ""TL-DR"" person, there's a Baseline section at the end of the review.ValueThe game itself offers excellent value for money - currently the non-sale asking price is €20, and you can have fun hours by the hundreds with this game. Thus I wouldn't bother waiting for a sale. The game can be played as just the base game without issues at all, although there is an element of pay to win in the sense that the best of guns and perk decks come at a price; DLCs. For buying DLCs I'd generally advise you to be patient - they're usually around 5€ each (and there are many), however when on sale they usually go for 1€ each, effectively giving you 5-for-1. You don't need the DLCs to have fun though - as the game is Coop, it's not as much pay to win but more like pay-to-be-better-than-the-next-guy. Some will unlock weapons and perks that help you become better though, and then there's the simple fun-factor in being awarded a broader array of weapons for your choosing.The game has only one game mode, which is a cooperative mode where players attempt to complete a heist through various objectives. This mode can be played by up to four players, which also include the ability to play heists alone. The players can decide if the empty spots should be filled by AI players or remain empty. AIs will be of little use, other than shooting enemies and reviving players - they will not aid in objective completion or help move bags or anything to that sort.DevelopersOverkill Software is, in my opinion, an astoneshing game developer. This game, almost on it's third year has had over 100 updates! These updates are not limited to bug fixes and tweaks, but also add new content such as new heists and new weapons on a regular basis - and some of this content is also available, even if you don't own a DLC.The pay-to-win is kept to a reasonable level, and a recent update rewamped the entire skill system. Examples of things, that have been added to this game post-release are heists (missions), tutorials, rewards systems (side jobs, gage packages, safes), weapons of all kinds, skill trees (fugitive skill tree), perk decks, throwable items (such as hand grenades), characters, masks, methods of transportation, difficulty levels, and an extension system to expand the number of levels in the game from 0-100 to 0-2626 levels.I have never seen a game being supported by it's developers to this extend, this far beyond release ever. That's the key point that warrents this review, and also a key selling point for me in the upcoming Payday 3. We're so far beyond the fairly sad ""industry standard"" of releasing games with obvious or game breaking bugs and fixing it with 1-3 patch versions, before turning the blind eye and instead focussing on the profits of the next upcoming titles instead.If all gamers demanded the level of engagement presented by Overkill Software from every publisher, by simply not buying the upcoming titles from poor developers who hit-and-run (or rather sell-and-ditch) their games, then the world of gaming would be a much better place. For now, a good oasis is Payday 2, and in my opinion, this aspect deserves much praise.GameplayWhile some heists can get stale and repetative after a while (especially in the early days, when there was substancially fewer heists in the game, generally the game offers a decent variety. Most heists can be attempted either loud or stealth, and at the core of gameplay is a random level generator, that changes many variables of the levels per time you play, meaning it'll never be entirely the same as last time.The game offers vastly different difficulty settings - not like some games, where easy, normal and hard a synonymous. The experience on Normal is fairly forgiving and you'll have few concerns. Then follows a traditional Hard and Very Hard, which again are slowly incrementing the difficulty (and reward). Overkill is the next increment, which is supposed to be around double as hard as Very Hard, and definitely is much more challenging with more special enemies and much greater spawn counts, as well as enemies being more resillient to damage and dropping less ammo for the players. Finally, there is DeathWish, accurately titled, as many heists are very difficult on DeathWish, especially if you're less than a full four man crew. The range of difficulty should allow all players to find a challenge - both at first when entering the game, but also when the player becomes more skilled in the game. This very much helps to keep the game fresh, even for very seasoned players.In no way should you expect this game to be a simulator. This is an arcade game - it's about four men going up against armies of police officers, SWATs, FBIs and special units, so the clue is very much there, but some players still do wonder that certain aspects are ""unrealistic"". Jokingly, it's also been referred to as Bag Moving Simulator 2013 and Drill Fixing Simulator 2013 as those two tasks were very frequent and stale in the early days of the game. New heists and features have helped in addressing this, although it can still be a bit repetative.This, combined with the fact that this game can be really fun, means that it's a game best played with friends. You form a heist-gang relationship, you'll find yourself joking about ""that time with the thing and the guy in the place"" you did with the same crew in a previous heist, and it'll be easy to fill the waiting time for a slow drill with fun conversation.That the game is best played with friends is also a drawback that you'll quickly notice; if you join a random session of players, even if the game does use geo-matching to set you up with people who should (in theory) be much like yourself, it's downright awfull in most cases. Statistically speaking, I would say that around 2% of the times you join a random session you will be enjoying a good, long run of good heists. More often than not, you'll be kicked after seconds in the lobby, because someone is waiting for someone else, and didn't bother understanding the ""Friends Only"" or ""Private"" settings, the game does offer when hosting. You'll also see alot of unintelligent hosts kicking other players before the payday of a heist, because they think loot is divided between players. All in all, it's best to play with friends, and just not bother too much with joining random lobbies.In the long run, you'll find yourself bored of specific heists or maybe even the entire game, but if you're like me, you'll try new heists (odds are, new ones have been added) or give the game a rest, play something else, and oddly find yourself going back to Payday once again.BaselineThe game offers excellent value for money, but is definitely best played with friends. There's a maximum of four players per session, so not many friends can play at the same time though. The game has slight pay-to-win, but nothing you can't ignore unless you're really into it. Developers are awesome in their continued efford to add content to the game, and the game itself is very stable (last update seems to have some sessioning issues, but I'm sure it'll be fixed).You can safely buy the game, even at full asking price (i.e. non-sale) 20€, if it looks appealing to you, as you'll likely have hundreds of hours in the game. You can save alot if you want the DLCs though, by waiting untill they are on sale, as they usually drop to a fifth of their normal price."

However, the one I drew the line at was the infamy tree where they made it hollow and pointless by making almost every new reward a mask.

Why is there like 10 other non important characters.Also i absolutely HATE the collabs, Payday should stick with just being Payday.The only acceptable Collab would honestly be Hotline Miami.I can kinda accept that, just a fun little thing.But when you bring in ♥♥♥♥ing GOAT SIMULATOR that's where the line is drawn. Also Scarface has no place here, his a ♥♥♥♥ing movie character. Like what? It's not even in the same timeline, his just totally randomly there.Payday 3 should be more Payday than any games before. Build upon what Payday 2 was at release and what Payday: The Heist Currently is and it will be Amazing.This review will be changed to Positive once i can see how future DLC is handled.Devs need to be able to give to Fans not only because they have Money but because they've been loyal.(Original Review)I remember playing this game on launch and in beta and i absolutely loved it. But their DLCs are ruining the game, it doesn't fill out the game, what could fill out the game is more weapon balancing, maybe more advanced A.I, or actually use the safehouse for anything.This game started out really good but quickly failed when the game devs got to greedy.And also there are 36 DLCs in the game! not all cost money but still worth mentioning, and by the time you see this they will probably have more."

Not great but okay. However, after a few updates, it surpassed the first Payday in every possible way, from it's map design to it's soundtrack to basically it's everything; It became the Payday we all wanted to play.After a fewmoreupdates though, we saw the beginning of the end and didn't even realize it. A few bits of overpriced DLC here and there, some really stupid balance choices, they brought back cloakers, then they balanced the cloakers better after a few more updates, and then they broke the weapon balance, then they broke the difficulty balance, then they fixed it, then they ♥♥♥♥ed with it, then they fixed it again, etc.We still loved the game so much so we were fine with it. I may not have played for thousands of hours like some people, but I do still remember the good times I had with this game before updates turned it into something I didn't recognize.A few more updates later, they went full TF2. The catch however, was that unlike TF2, the changes were not merely cosmetic, and the game did not go free to play. Okay, a few microtransactions here and there, it's ♥♥♥♥ing stupid and greedy, except that's not the problem. The problem is that they promised not to and did so anyway. For a company that implies they pride themselves on their fanbase they sure do treat their fanbase like ATM machines instead of people.Eventually I just stopped playing.

Late 2014, the game had come so far, and in ways that no one could have imagined they improved the best game of the genre. Just this week, I've been rushing to build my new PC in time for crimefest, because I knew that Overkill wanted to roll out something big. And they did.Microtransactions. In a £30 game. With £200 of DLC. Microtransactions that provide weapon stat boosts.If you have a time machine, go back 2 years and a bit, and get as many hours in before this update. But don't get to fond of the game. I'm happy I played most of the time I'll ever play before this update, it's sad that they've implemented so much around the same time as this, and even teased at the Secret.With stat boosting microtransactions, goonmod weapon customiser broken, and promises being broken I can't say that this game will be on my computer for much longer, and it's no longer a game I can recommend.Payday The Heist on the other hand: Has nearly everything good of PD2, but nothing bad. It runs much better on a wider range of PCs, unlike the unoptiimised mess that is Payday 2, and most of all isn't getting game breaking updates.To Ovk: Why not do something like Goonmod Weapon Customiser?? Srly, a modder pretty much has done all the work and you could have sat back and just injected the code in, no hassle no work, happy community. Yet you go out of your way to create a micro transaction system that won't make you any friends.Also, didn't you explicitly say that you didn't want microtransactions? something along the lines of ""NO.

The only difference is that they had a functional beta they were selling instead of a non-functional alpha tech demoOh boy, reviewing Payday 2. What's there to say?It's the essence of 'good enough' turned into a game. It does not have many noticable good points and the noticable flaws are swept under the carpet and behind the couch.It's an fps game with decent graphics, decent guns, and decent action. You can sneak missions or just go in and shoot everything up. Most objectives are fairly simple 'loot x and move the bags to extraction point y', which earned it a nickname of 'Bag moving simulator'. Luckily, most later missions move away from 'just move loads of bags' to more interesting missions, but the majority of missions are still fairly simple looting missions.That said, the technology behind it all is roughly 2000s level, so don't expect anything past the basics to workLoot that you can use mainly to buy more guns, and at times a customised mask. Aside from that, your money is essentially just a number that goes up after you win a mission.  You should not have any problem with money unless you are actively avoiding the higher difficulty missions(Which are not all that tough except on Deathwish difficulty). Most of the higher difficulties are only just adding more health or damage to the cops, or adding more specials like tasers and riot shields.The game as a whole feels unfinished, as though they reached the halfway point in making it and then decided 'good enough, polish it a bit and start selling'. Considering the DLC they've put out, I highly doubt they had any actual plans past this first half, or maybe they just cancelled whatever they had, I can't say it's showing any sort of long term planning.(Edit: They have no long term plans or any plans at all. They do not intend to deliver on even half their release promises)Being a 4-player team based game, of course you are best off playing with friends. Teamwork is essential for some of the harder missions and difficulties. You will generally find it much more enjoyable if you play with people you know, as it is at its core about a group of four friends working together to pull of heists.In the end, it's an alright game, with DLC piled upon DLC with DLC attached, most of which are extra guns or cosmetic changes, with a few of them being new heists to do. It's worth noting that only one in four players needs the heist DLC, and the rest can join the host without owning it.In the end, Payday 2 is alright, it does just enough to be considered playable but not much past that. If you have friends to play with, pick it up when it's on sale (Under 10 euro only), have yourselves a good time and then shelve it again - There isn't much replay value past achievements and trying to just bring your money number as high as possible. No endgame, no safehouse customisation, and no way to really spend your ingame money, just more of the same heists you've already done.Edit: And now it's also Pay2win. Enjoy the neg review, Overkill. You ♥♥♥♥ed up again and again, and I kept saying 'Maybe they meant well'.Maybe they were just trying to make a game and they were just not good enough to do it right. But now I have no doubt that they're just milking this thing for all they can. Payday 2 is a good concept that could have been great.If it was done by someone that wasn't OverkillIf it wasn't half of a game with DLC to buy the rest of itIf it wasn't just there to milk people of their money, completely ignoring all their promisesDon't bother with this drekEdit2: ""Drills now drop in cards""Such a non-fix.

,Recommended,218620,11323028,"Posted: 19 July, 2014",all,Nifty,"Payday 2, Not sure where to start on writing this review.  This game has offers quiet a bit even with the bugs and there are bugs but patches seem pretty regular which is good.   Having never played the first but I have heard good things about it and few friends recommend it yet.  The two things they say it has in common is how horrible the AI is.  The AI definitely needs some work its not horrible but some tweaking would be in order. With that being its biggest downfall this game is exceptionally awesome.  I picked it up in the Steam Summer Sale 80%  off WELL WORTH EVERY PENNY I've been eying it awhile but after playing it I would recommend the $29.99 is also a good price for what it offers.  So the  game is pretty straight forward you are bank robbers, muscle for drug cartels, and straight up crooks.  The offline play is a little lacking but I would recommend after installing to play offline a few missions and get the layouts of the maps, objectives down, and get a feel for the game.  After that its all about the online play.  Its a four person co-op game ideally you would have each of the four skills trees in in group, Mastermind, Enforcer, Technician, and Ghost.  The Mastermind (Dallas) is the leader that can manipulate the situations to get a better control over them.   The Enforcer (Chains)(my favorite) is the just like the name the big guns, tank, and portable saw for cracking safe deposit boxes.  Technician (Wolf) just likes stuff that goes BOOM!!! He gets trip mines and C4 the further they progress on the tree.  The Ghost (Hoxton) silent and just as deadly also get the safe cracking skill which is so helpful.  There are five mission difficulties normal, hard, very hard, overkill, and death wish.  The pay and experience earned is greater on the levels and so is the risk do not go into an overkill unprepared, and don't even think about a death wish till you are a season veteran in the game.  Then there are Pro Jobs also one shot is all you get no repeats.  Now the game does get a monotonous lacking in a variety of missions but they make up for it making the spawns and layouts just a little bit different every time you load an ready up a mission. Now keep in mind there are only really two play styles loud guns a blazing from the get go or silent the way the game was meant to be played.  Other then the occasional idiots you get teamed up.  This is one game that does have a lot of replay potential with the down sides of the bugs, AI, mind numbing missions over and over, and the idiots.  But nothing gets your heart raising more then pulling of the biggest heist and get that hard fought and elusive achievement to show off your badge of honor.  And once you play more and more you find a group of friends who love the game and I've never had so many or sent so many steam friend request for one game this is a tight nit community that loves the game and good people to play with.  I highly recommend the game."

I picked up Payday 2 over a year ago and insatiably racked up over 200 hours of play in the following months. I mostly played solo up to almost Infamy 3, and I loved every minute of it. Then the Hype Train event happened. Overkill introduced the SWAT turret enemy and other ""rebalancing"" patches since that have made solo play completely unenjoyable. The AI was never good to begin with, and it has never been improved. It simply cannot handle the turret. Or really *any* speacial unit spawn. Overkill has shifted the focus of the game almost entirely to multiplayer play - which is fine if you always play with a group of friends or in public groups, but if you play solo like I preferred to do, you're just out of luck. Overkill took away my ability to play the game as I enjoy playing it, and spat on their veteran players during the Crimefest event just recently. I used to support them through thick and thin, but it's clear now that they just want to monetize this game for all it's worth at the expense of their most loyal and long-term fans, and I just can't accept that.I was on the fence about uninstalling when I noticed the game was eating up over 24gb of hard drive space by itself. For a game with Half-Life 2 graphics and dodgy physics, that's insane. I've uninstalled this monstrocity and I don't see myself playing it again.Thanks for the memories, Overkill.

Then they killed the game by adding weapon skins WITH bonus stats packaged with a base nerf of the weapons as well to make it seem like they balanced it. The only way to get a crate key is by paying $2.50 (half the price of a dlc mind you) with a random chance mostly a high chance to get a crappy skin.

He would've been released anyways.)Several heists can be played in radically different ways, from ziplining past buildings whilst being shot by snipers, to ramming school buses through concrete walls while fighting Jackie Chans and cops.A few more things I'm probably forgetting.Cons: So many DLC's that will give you essential weapons that are far surprerior to base onesThe OK team will play you for dumbasses, (For our rewards in thist past anniversary we have gotten masks, meme masks, JUMPING animations and microtransactions)You can be kicked at the end of the heist if you're not close to the escape vanMany members are either really nice or jerksMajor lag with player models as you can see others sometimes walk through the middle of a cop filled parking lot when in reality they're beside you.Many heists are DLC, so to host these heists you need to buy them.You can buy DLC characters for different voice lines or skillsYou can buy DLC guns to get past that one cop who's always been killing youIf none of these work you can buy drills now to get skins for your guns, CSGO style that can make your gun better with more damage, accuracy, clip size or etc!No Vacban so you can and probably will run into hackers after a while.Servers (at least for me) are prone to d/c you a lot. I can download an easy 10 MB/s if you want to blame my internet for that.Game is currentely filled with only new players as many vets have decided to quit over the drillsCurrent gun balance has the pistols shooting with more damage then the sniper rifles or shotgunsAll of that above is just glazing the surface, but in short almost all the vets quit over the microtransactions added in, the OK team says that those that complained obviously don't know what they're talking about, gun balance is curently♥♥♥♥♥♥♥and if you want to be a good player be prepared to buy DLCs to upgrade your arsenal.

Hence why I have 911 hours in the game.However, since a recent event, I cannot reccommend it. Specifically, the developers had their second annual ""Free stuff for the community"" event known as Crimefest recently. They took the opportunity, during an event meant to give free stuff, to implement a microtransactions system that on top of copying CS:GO or TF2's system, additionally has some of these skins go further than simple cosmetics, outright giving stat boosts. Some skins act as pre-modded guns with exclusive mods, some of them are DIRECT stat increases. Before someone tells you +4 stability or accuracy isn't a big deal, there are skins even more significant than that. Multiple ones allow you to exceed 30 concealment, which is a rather important stat for stealth you can't exceed via any other means.Not to mention, it still violates the principle of pay-to-win either way. I held off making this review, but the community representative has stated the stats on the skins are not changing. The only compromise they've made is allowing the 2.50$ drills to drop VERY rarely.This wouldn't be so much of a problem if they hadn't been pushing the community's buttons in favor of more money. Previously, they've had (In no particular order):-The Alesso Heist, a paid DLC entirely dedicated to promoting a musician named Alesso. The heist in question is one of the most shameless advertisements I've ever seen. It's literally filled with Alesso merchandise everywhere, posters with his face on it, and dialogue like ""Whoever fixes it gets to meet Alesso!"" spoken by main characters.-The Hype Train, which was an event similar to Crimefest; The catch being unlocking the free content required the community as a whole to purchase DLC. The DLCs that contributed the most were the Overkill Pack and the limited time Completely Overkill Pack, both of which are some of the most low-content DLC avaliable, and the Completely Overkill pack wasn't even finished when it was avaliable; They promised a secret cosmetic reward for purchasers that they'd release later. The only reason it ""Succeeded"" was thanks to a Hotline Miami 2 tie-in that appeared halfway through.-The John Wick promotion. Last Crimefest, there was a super secret reward. Getting it wasn't particularly easy; (It required the community to attain a total of 1.5 million members) And it turned out to be a movie promotion. The community was, rightfully, a little angry. It added Akimbo weaponry, but that was brushed over in favor of John Wick, who sadly isn't voiced by Keanu Reeves in-game and is instead voiced by an amateur imitator.That was just the abridged version. Look further into Overkill's mistakes if you're curious about what else the developers have done. The rabbit hole goes further, I assure you.And now, we have microtransactions. I love this game, but I cannot support its developers, and I cannot reccommend supporting the developers. I've actually been forced to uninstall the game out of sheer disgust. If you have no moral problems with supporting godawful buisness practices, get this game, it's a great FPS, I assure you.If you don't want the games industry to descend into little more than a farm with you being the cows, stay the hell away from this. Don't support these kind of buisness practices. If it wasn't for the fact the people who made this game have spat on their most loyal customers in favor of the whales, I would recommend this to hell and back. But I cannot justify giving a single penny to the people who made this.EDIT INVOLVING THE RECENT NO MICROTRANSACTIONS STUFFOkay, the information in this review has now changed quite a bit! For those who don't know, something quite important has changed; the microtransactions have been removed (As bset as they can be), and 505 Games no longer own the rights to Payday.That leaves a question that we don't really know the answer to. How much, if at all, were 505 responsible for the absolute insanity Payday 2's gone through in the past two years? Is Bo Andersson (Starbreeze's CEO) really the monster the community demonized him as, or is he just using 505 as a convienient cover?I don't know the answer to that question yet, and I won't for a while. I'm no longer holding off playing this game again, but if I were you I'd hold off buying it, for at least a while. See if Overkill/Starbreeze really have turned over a new leaf, or if they just found the absolute limits they can push the community to accept and they've only now begrudgingly accepted those limits.Remember, the Goat Simulator DLC happened. We still need to find the person responsible."

I don't think it is fair to condemn companies because of micro-transactions but I think it is very fair to condemn overkill for releasing them this late in the game. There are many players who have helped support this game from the beginning and have gladly shelled out money for their already high priced DLC and are now being punished for their support through the new micro-transaction system.I have totally lost faith in overkill.

,Not Recommended,218620,20874413,"Posted: 31 January, 2016",all,Krawkyz,"TL;DR The Community likes Payday 2 more than the devs do. Amazing game, apathetic developer.Payday 2 is a fantastic game. It's too bad ever since a complete shift in its personnel it could be considering the second shadiest developer of 2015, below Konami (obviously) but above EA (astonishingly). It's crazy how one of the go-to Steam games of all time has become a taboo to name in common conversation.The addition of microtransactions to a game with half of its DLC costing $50 (including the game)  [the other half is not bundled, costing around $50 more] is completely unjustifiable. If you believe that a full game with DLC costing over $50 having microtransactions is not a problem, please see Jim Sterling's video on the matter. To make matters worse, of course, it was stated earlier they would not. As well, these microtransactions provide (and still provide some) ingame benefits. Originally, skins (from microtransactions) gave stat boosts. Now, they only allow for a second ingame-acquired boost with a good enough skin. They have since not apologized for these actions and continue to sell microtransactions. [They removed microtransactions, but have not made an apology that recognized their deception.]What's really sad is it seems the community enjoys Payday 2 more than Overkill [the dev] does. It's apparent even in their pandering goat simulator DLC ad at the start of the game. There's a crazy section with them trying to steal goats that can defy physics, but then right after, the Payday 2 intro cutscene is incredibly more serious and doesn't try to pander to a younger, less frugal populace. It's a stark contrast right as the game starts up. [This trailer has since been removed, but check youtube for it. It's pretty bad.]One last thing that has happened recently: Payday 2 now crashes more often than battlefield 4 did at release. The game crashed. A lot. What's strange is that this issue arised from something that's been in the game since release, marking enemies. I guess the new crew at Overkill don't know what the old crew did to make the game work. Since then, they've made a temporary fix removing marking for loud missions. Obviously, they could've done this right when the crashing started, but instead of putting the temporary fix for their audience first, they wanted to see if they could fix it. Now, the game crashes more than ever, and the devs are ever less responsive to feedback from players.In essence, this game is fantastic. If you play it with friends, it will be a lot of fun. However, I cannot recommend it unless the following happens:-Overkill apologizes for its deception-Microtransactions are removed completely [Done.]-Overkill begins to respect Payday 2 as its game-Fix the crashing problems without temporary fixesIt's just so sad to see such an amazing game be absolutely hated by its fanbase, not because of the game, but because of the dev.Oh, and be careful of the diehard fans. You know the ones, people who kept supporting Overkill while they ruined the game."

This whole concept shows a flawed mindset in how they view their customers, and I think reviews should be based on the actual game.

I'll leave the original review at the end.The game itself can be fun, however public lobbies range from fantastic to catastrophic. Often tending to the later.Some of the promised updates were finally implemented (more or less) like the customizable safe house. However it still leaves a bitter taste that the entire apocalypse had to occur first.A LOT of the content is locked as DLC content, however you can join public heists to play those. Better hope to not find a terrible group or getting kicked. Both happening way too frequent and of course cheaters.Default answer is ""Host your own game"", which is the only solution to most problems because the game is p2p.There's also the issue of payday breaking regulary when an update is released. Oh the updates ... they take forever, even when the update is only like 10 mb in size.The performance is quite an issue, the reasong is the engine which is old one. You won't get any performance boost from having a lot of cores.Some levels are un-optimized as hell and will cause your fps to drop even with a modern graphics card.Also the game can get very repetitive if you don't try new things. The amount of random in each heist is very low (except GO Bank, but ♥♥♥♥ that heist).To really enjoy the game, you need friends or reliable people from a group to play this game, so you can try alternative setups and have got a better communication.I really like the game, however i can't recommend it in good conscience to anyone without friends to play it with and a decent gaming pc.--- Original review ---As the situation with the microtransactions has been resolved, i'll give a negative recommendation.Simply put Overkill doesn't care about the consumers.In the last crimefest the bots got the ability to do a hostage trade.

However, recent business decisions & updates to the game made by OVERKILL have made me think otherwise.Looking at the DLC List alone, there are atleast 25+ purchase required content that add up to over $100.  In addition, with each DLC release, OVERKILL would introduce some form of power creep to make existing weapons worse and harder to clear originally managable content.Basicly, they expect you to pay atleast $50 in addition to the base game to experience anything remotely close to the full content.  These include weapons and skills that are locked behind dlc and are helpful in tackling the power creep which is very apparent in this game.Don't forget there are also locked weapons and characters for game promotions.  Oh, you don't own Hotline Miami 2?  Well then you won't have access to this character, mask, and weapon.And for the finishing touch, they introduced microtransaction to Payday 2 as of Oct 15.  They nerfed many weapons during this update, and the only way you can get stats anywhere close to the guns pre-nerf is to buy ""Drills & Safes"" to open and get rare skins.

One of the featured special cops isn't in the game-Boring progression. After unlocking level 36, there is nothing else to unlock apart from random items in payday. These items will require players to finish heists to have a chance to earn them. But du to the high amount of items, it ends up by grinding heists again and again. Same goes with XP, which gets very long to earn after a while, even by completing most difficult heists. Like said before, all heists look the same and are all set in similar landscapes, making them totaly not memorable. There may be more heists than the previous game but most of them are way shorter and bland.-Broken development. Tha game came out 3 months ago and we're already around 20 patches, some of them often result with complete rebalance, making the progression quite unstable and bring bugs into the game. There is a lot of gliches in the game, with some even preventing to complete heists which haven't got fix withing all the patches.The game may look pretty fun and decent at the beginning but all these elements I listed above make the fun go downhill pretty fast."

And though they tried damage control by adding the drills for loot safes as random drops, they have the lowest chance to drop of almost anything in the game.

Well because its not the game what I bought in 2014.Overkill has completely destroy what made the game unique by just adding random stuff what they liked and by doing that COMPLETELY Killing the lore and seriousness the game had! It's really sad!Packs like ""Scarface pack"", ""Chivarly Pack"", ""Hotline Miami Pack"", ""John Wick Pack"" all sound like really pathetic attempts to get some attention from the devs or creators of those franchises. They all feel like sellout moves, like they are trying to make the game a rentable advertising space.The ammount of DLC in the game is mindblowing, currently 170€ of packs that rip content from the game. It has been released durning nearly 3 years, instead of making a new game and get money from that they keep milking this game, the worst part is that the community does not see the DLC mountain as a problem but a blessing because if there was no DLC they would get bored, thats how OVERKILL keeps getting away with it, in case you wondered""But Train Simulator"" Train simulators DLC model is different, none of the trains have stat improvements, they are skins. Same with Rocksmith! It has few thousand dollars worth of DLC (Songs) from what you are supposed to pick and choose your favorites. PAYDAY 2 DLC items actually statisical upgrades what is ridiculous, I would not complain about the DLC situation if the weapons would just be remodels.The performance of the game is awful, the game runs worse than it looks!

Since the results are random, you may need to buy extra DLC just to use your newly-purchased skin.$130.  Plus extra for a random chance at stat boosts.  The game developers point to TF2 (a free game) and CS:GO (cheap, with NO DLC) as their inspiration.  While it's true that you buy a key to open a chest, the similarities end there.  The company says they need to make more money since their staff has tripled, but PD2 is also their most successful game of all time.  If their most successful game cannot keep itself afloat, should we really throw good money after bad?(Edit) On the off-chance the developers end this money-grabbing nonsense, here's what I think of the pre-crimefest game.  It's a HELL of a lot of fun, difficult (if you want it), slow-paced deliberate stealthing followed by a frenzy of running and emptying every magazine you have as fast as possible...or just go in guns blazing on most heists on most difficulty steeings, if that's your thing.  Customization is fun and VARIED, but there are lots of ""required"" skill points you MUST use at all times to be a competent character; with no hints about what those might be without looking up third-party guides.  The DLC is extensive, and EXPENSIVE if you want it all; but you really don't ""need"" any of it.  The base game is plenty fun enough.

No.They don't care about the community anymore, Payday 2 has become the milking cow of Overkill after they saw how much money they could make with it.Overall I feel like they severly killed payday2 with the crimefest event and it's not what it used to be anymore, it used to be a wonderful shooter, but if you're not buying DLC and now not buying safes and drills, you'll be slightly disadvantaged and severely limited in your content."

Unfortunately, Overkill has decided that they aren't making enough money to support their aggressive expansion plans and decided to add microtranscations to this game 2 years after it's release. These transactions are and add-on the the already nearly $120 worth of DLC with much of that required to be able to play the game in its current state. The transactions themselves are much like CS:GO and TF2 in that they're cosmetics. What is different is that the cosmetics add stats, and Overkill just nerfed many of the weapons in the game making it nearly mandatory to buy the new skins in order to have weapons that work anything like they did before the update.All of these changes are being implemented because Overkill just tripled their staff and are planning to work on other games. In other words, they're asking you to go ahead and prefund their other ventures by purchasing game breaking cosmetics on top of spending $140 to play their game. Payday 2 has a very hardcore following and the community has asked that if microtransactions are staying that they atleast be cosmetic only so they don't break the game. Overkill responded by saying the transactions are staying and they're planning on making stats gained from skins a central part of the game play which of course will force you to buy them. They did finally add the ability to unlock skins for free after a week of bad press, but the drop rate is so low it's insignificant and you may get a skin that's for a DLC item that you haven't purchased yet meaning it's entirely worthless until you buy the needed DLC.Now, I'm a reasonable person and understand that it costs money to make games and that the purpose is to make something people will like and a profit at the same time. Slapping microtransactions onto a 2 year old game with a dedicated fanbase because you made some poor management decisions is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Especially when the players have already paid $140 to play the game. Gamers aren't an ATM, and the Payday 2 community doesn't appreciate being treated as such."

With the initial $30 dollar price tag I wouldn't expect too much DLC if any at all, but here we are years later and now with microtransactions the game is failing community wise. Overkill hasn't done much for the community other than the interview/promo videos for their games saying they are indie devs and care about what we as the community want fixed. They can't hide behind being an indie developer when they got backed by Sony (Payday 1) and 505 (Payday 2) as a publisher. The game itself can actually hold up well despite being broken in a lot of ways, which is very shocking but also dissapointing when they won't fix some of the most basic of issues.

There's probably a bit too much DLC really, but it's not so bad as usually you could just cherry pick the bits you wanted during sales and have a pretty nice bargain.Now though on top of all of this, they have microtransactions.I can't support this move, particularly as the delivery method means that if I play and win a safe, it will have replaced a reward that would otherwise be free, as the safes are rewarded as card drops for successful completion of a heist - the card drops were always free, and could be anything from in game cash, to extremely rare masks or That One Awesome Weapon Attachment You've Been Waiting For.If you buy a key to open the safe, it will provide you with a modded and skinned version of a weapon or a straight up skin, but the skin could be for a weapon that is for DLC you don't own, meaning they get to double dip or you wasted your money - choose whichever you prefer.The skins also come with stat boosts, which I find worrying as it may set a trend in the community towards pubs not wanting to play with people who use the default weapons - this pay to win addition could lead to a more exlusionary community.I haven't played this game properly in a while but in the leadup to Crimefest, I reinstalled and was planning to have another pass at it.

First month i couldn't connect to my friends, and if I could, game kicked me every minute because IDK why. Ok, i waited a few moths, started to play. Found ~30% of features Overkill promised to us. No good briefnig, no good stealth (remember glitchy stealth and bank robbery without alarm at first few months). So, Overkill decided to change META, nerf mastermind, rework stealth and other things.DELUXE BENEFITSSo, now you should ask me: ""Man, wtf? Why did you bought deluxe edition and what did you get? Literally 1 map and ♥♥♥♥♥♥ scope. Ah, and soundtrack, OFC! So, it was the first dissapointment.Why it's not about robberyIf you readAbout gameyou decide, that this game is about cool heists, banks, tactical action, funny pursuits and other stuff that we have in GTA V. NO. Overkill made PayDay2 the worst robbery game ever. You will grind and farm levels, local analog of prestige (reputation) for new perks and all maps finally will so boring, that you will delete this piece of crap. There are 3 bank's, yep. 2 small and 1 medium. That's all about banks. You can steal nuclear warheads from SWAT, which will fire at you like you carring not nuclear warheads but target for shooting practice. Yes, there is no big tactic moves, all you should do it's defend your drill, which will annoy you every minute. And enemy waves. Mmm, it's like playing Orc Must Die! but against not Orcs but SWAT. A lot of SWAT. DAMN, Overkill, it looks like the WHOLE USA move it's forces to catch 4 mad criminals. Too boring, realy. And always the same way: intrude, put drill, repair drill few times, take the stuff, runaway.$$$DLC$$$So now you can tell me smth like: ""It's your decision to buy or not to buy DLC"". Yeah, it's only my decision, related on some things like 50% maps in DLCs. 80% of weapons in DLCs, same amount of attachments for them in DLCs too. New characters, new stuff -- all in DLCs. And if we combine all DLC's features, we will never reach 50% of things Overkill promised to us. Offshore cash for upgrading your vault? Furk off, ♥♥♥♥, the only purpose of offshore cash is prestige leveling, even so not for a long time.Ok then, some DLCs not bad, but what with you, overkill, dinamite and SPEARS? LOLWHUT?ReplayabilityHow i said, all heists will be boring because of grind, which requires a lot of succesfull passed missions. If you play with your friends (2-3 guys) it will be funny, it's better to buy goty edition (the best is not to buy this game) with 75% discount and play just for fun. But never buy another DLCs.WE WILL NEVER ADD MICROSTRANSACTIONS!So, they added it 15th october IIRC. Foking CS:GO's skins, which IMPROVE your weapon's STATS. YEAS, they nerfed all weapons and added skins which boost your weapon. It's very bad practice.What we have? Good conception, good idea, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ realisation, bad gameplay, grind, lack of heist's ideas and other. Better to believe that somebody make the real robbery simulator.

Wasn’t there at the release and nearly a year they said the delay was because they wanted to make it really good.Next is infamy and infamy 2.0. First we got infamy which was 5 levels which got you skill cost reduction, skill points required for each tier reduced, and almost pointless increase to experience gained (why add it if it’s going to stop). Then we got INFAMY 2.0 which added twenty more levels of Infamy which only added increased experience, eight masks oh and 20 achievements. Which doesn’t give you any bonuses like the first one did. Experience? Why do you need 205% increase in experience at infamy 25? What good does it do other than getting you there faster?Thirdly we have pay to win DLC. First off I’m going to say overkill (second hardest difficulty) can be done with no DLC it’s not so hard that it needs it. But deathwish it’s needed, with shotguns having explosive rounds to stun dozers and mess up shields it makes it a lot easier. With sniper rifles 2 or 3 shots and a dozer is dead, RPG blowing up a crowd of enemies, it makes it a lot easier. Grenades, and weapon mods that add a lot more damage than base game modifications…Last we have micro transactions in the form of cases from CSGO. You get a safe and you need to buy a key… I mean drill to unlock it. In this you get a randomly selected skin for a gun. That’s okay I guess if people are going to pay for a “better looking gun” that’s their choice not mine. BUT WAIT they add stats +4 damage to this gun with a skin, or +4 concealment from another skin.You drove me away because of your broken promises.Definitions:Overkill: second hardest difficulty in the gameDeathwish: the hardest difficulty in the gameSafe house: is a visitable location in Payday 2. It is where the crew resides and operates from when not on a heist, and also serves as a tutorial for new players.Infamy: similar to CoD prestige where when you hit the max level you can choose to restart at 1 and work your way back up."

The constant DLC grated on me a bit, but the game was good, the idea was FANTASTIC, and the DLC's usually provided something new. I passed on a few of the more recent ones, picking them up on sale here and there, unless there was something to really grab my attention in the packs, I ordered the completely overkill pack for hype fuel, because it was only masks, but it supported a good company that I respected, and who's game I enjoyed. Nevertheless, with each money snatching DLC that was released, I got a little more frustrated with the company. Today, I learned that they had introduced microtransactions. I then learned that these microtransactions included stat boosts for weapons. Shortly thereafter, I learned that they had initially stated that microtransactions would never be a part of this game. I loved Payday 2 once, but.. I feel like that time is over.  When you add all this to the gun rebalancing, meaning I need to relearn all my guns, figure out which ones meet my playstyle, and then re fine-tune them, it's just not worth the hassle. I'm sorry overkill, but unless drastic action is taken, you've lost a player here.In short: Was a great game, killed by the developer's greed."

Unfortunately, that seems to have gotten worse over the last year, as the full game (core + dlc) is now up to well over $100 before discounts. Recently, the community has exploded because on top of being a paid game with paid DLC, they've introduced microtransaction skins (a la CS:GO, TF2) that:1) Cost money, obviously2) Confer a stat bonus, so more you spend the better your gear (this is different than CS:GO and TF2 where they are purely cosmetic)3) Are randomly opened in cases, adding to the existing complaint that the content is too RNG heavy4) Were released during an event that is usually free content to celebrate the birthday of the game after the community put a lot of effort into unlocking rewards5) Explicitly go against the comments of the developers that the game would never have microtransactionsIt seems greedy and disingenuous, they're effectively triple-dipping their pricing model by charging for the game, the dlc and the items therein.I did have fun playing it and I would play it again if not for this whole kerfluffle. I can't really feel good about supporting a developer that gouges their customers (and I felt like they were gouging their customers a year ago, this just confirms/solidifies my feeling on the matter).If none of these things are important to you, it's still a fun game. Someone else can speak to how easy/difficult it is to play solo because I'm not sure if that has changed at all. Before, it was more difficult to find good players than it was to find an actual game; I don't think I ever had issues finding people to play with but you never know what kind of player it would be.Also, all of the respectable devs/management of the old company has left because of the direction the company is moving in.

But slowly as time progressed, more and more DLC's were being added to the game adding stronger weapons and making it seem like it was getting closer to pay to win. Now, they just added a new pay to win DLC that tops it all off, despite the devs saying a long time ago that it will not become pay to win. The new skin DLC thing makes it like CSGO skins, but the rarer they are, the better the stats they have. Which means that ifyou buy a rarer, more expensive skin, you have better stats on that weapon.Other than that, the game itself was fun for the first 30 hours, but after that the games gets a bit repetitive. They do make certain things in each level spawn in different locations to mix it up and add replay value. There are many ways you can go about a specific mission. You can go in loud with guns blazing and defend against hoardes of cops, or you can go in quiet by taking out guards and cameras with silenced weapons and not have to fight a single person. There are many skills in the skill trees which allow you to play according to your play style and you can dip into multiple skill trees, which is nice. But overall, the game started to get a bit boring for me after those 30 hours. I know people who have hundreds and even thousands of hours on the game which means it obviously has good replay value, so maybe i'm just playing it wrong or its not entirely the game for me."

The game seemed to come out with a weapon pack every month or so for 5 dollars, which could cost even more than the game itself just to have all the dlc's that were coming forth at a time, but it wasn't really that big of a deal at the time since, well, there were only 1-3 weapons in the pack and getting them wasn't a necessity. Then more and more types of dlc's came out with new characters and maps and just very very little things that kinda makes you wonder, ""Couldn't they just have put it in for free or make it part of a bigger pack altogether?"" And that's where the realization comes in, small bit by small bit of dlc came crushing in and for someone with none of the dlc, there'd just be a big bunch of red you-can't-have-this-since-you-didn't-buy-it marks all over the place. Then the nail in the coffin, stat boosting skins. Now I'm not going to go off about it since there are already videos on it, but this pretty much sums up the death of Payday 2. It all just went downhill till we reached here. So should you get it? It's up to you, the game is fun and all, just don't expect it to get any better in its current state."

Now there's in-game micro-transactions that reward you with far better weapons than the default game has to offer. I can't say too much having not played the most recent updates, (since they've added about 10 or more DLC packs since I played last just a few months ago), but I can say that the fact that more than two thirds of the missions and items are DLC-locked speaks for itself.

While the game boasts an advanced modding system and a variety of missions, I cannot recommend that anyone buys this game. Reason being is that the developers have put in a huge amount of DLC worth over £80 and then decided they want even more of players money by introducing features you'd expect in Farmville. They brought in microtransactions to give weapon skins that are NOT cosmetic only. They actually give stat boosts to your weapons. To rub salt into the wound this feature was given to us as a ""reward"" during an event where all the content is supposed to be free. Bear in mind this game has been out for two years and only now have they put in jumping animations but only after they made us work for a basic feature that should have been there on release.At this point it becomes less about the game and more about how you feel towards a company. If you don't care about Overkill's awful business practices and just want to play the game for fun then go right ahead. But if you're buying just the base game your weapon access is heavily limited and very poorly balanced and then will be tempted to invest in DLC which at this point is a Pay2Win feature. But if you do care about how a company represents itself and treats its userbase then don't EVER give Overkill Studios your money in any way shape or form. Because if you give them your money it essentially tells them that what they're doing is OK and it sets a precedent for other companies to do the same.I've got 300 hours logged on this game and I'm seriously considering an uninstall of the game. And there are players with over 1000 hours who have already unistalled. This is how badly Overkill have treated their community. We're all leaving. It's such a disappointment to see a company who until 2 weeks ago were praised as one of the best developers going, now they're being compared to EA and Ubisoft.In closing, please don't buy this game. Just bury it and move on.EDIT:This review is accurate as of update 90.Following a new update Overkill decided to give the 50,000 people thet forked out £15 to support them a huge kick in the teeth by giving them a skin which also has cash and XP boosts. To try to apologise for the delay in release they gave the owners 7 free DLC. Most Completely Overkill Pack owners own all the DLC already and these free DLC are put straight into the library which means you can't even give them away.

,Not Recommended,218620,18826720,"Posted: 1 November, 2015",all,CIA,"Hello everyone. I bought this game fairly recently and was enjoying it thoroughly.I was a bit shocked at the amount of DLC, but the core gameplay was good. When it comes to masks and characters, I suppose its almost acceptable to pay to obtain things as it is you who choses what character you prefer and how you want to play. But I find the fact that you have to pay for weapons and weapon mods a disgrace. Completionists cannot grind this game to the end without spending, if you add them all up, a ridiculous amount of money.I want to add that I purchased wuite a bit of the DLC when I first go the game because I didnt know there was this much, I also got two characters because I like them.This problem can be overlooked when compared to the recent update which installed microtransactions. The gun stats were modified so that they were essentially nerfed and to return to prior levels of glory and go beyond, you have to spend money to get skins which increase your gun stats (unrealistic AF for those who enjoy that aspect in games might I add).BUT THIS GETS WORSE! Because unlike paid DLC, you do not know what you are getting! So the devellopers are asking you to pay to get a chance to have a skin which overall will make your gun better.This has been made less acceptable by the fact that Overkill has made past promises never to install such things in their game.I mean, what happened at the last shareholder's meeting for them to decide that making people pay a full priced game, Gun dlc, Skin dlc wasnt enough already (considering that the former two are already unacceptable considering you PAID FOR THE GAME)?But adding a randomized pay to win system in a full priced game? A disgrace. An insult to the community which has kept this game alive.Since we have been insulted by the people we have fed, I reccomend treating them like you would a disrespectful child. Ignore them until they have no choice but to repent.I hope you realise what you have done Overkill. I am a member of a large part of your player base which has fallen out of love with you."

Now i do perfectly understand they need to sell dlc to keep working on the game and while i dissaproved i still accepted it since they did release free content and the dlc did extend the life of the game.Here are some of the major problems with this game:1. PAYWALLYou cannot play the game properly anymore without buying afew dlc packs since over 90% of the inventory will be locked to you which would be fine if you didn't need some of the tools that are offered. These include things such as the grenade launchers and HE rounds for shields and dozers, snipers for the same thing and even the dragons breath rounds and flamethrower.It doesn't even stop there with so many mods being locked, that your weapons from the very limited selection you have can't even be modded to full effectiveness as someone who bought the dlc's.2. BUGS BUGS BUGSIt seems with every update there are more and more bugs with heists being released or even something such as a free update having just major major bugs most recently the bipod teleporting people off the map causing them to be unable to be revived which wasn't fixed for awhile. However the chivalry DLC bug which allowed people to buy the dlc weapons for free without having the dlc got patched in about 5 minutes, while the bipod was a free update and took afew days go figure.Most of the  bugs don't even get patched for a very long time and these arn't minor stupid things these are very serious ones such as random crashes or certain achievements being impossible to get or even worse the heist bugging out and being impossible to finish.3.OVERKILL THEMSELVESJesus ♥♥♥♥ing christ overkill i used to like you, payday 1 was incredible and you cared about your community overdrill and the wolf pack clearly showed that 2 new GOOD heists a whole new skill tree equipment and guns for £4.99 wowNow we have 1 heist maybe a gun and some ♥♥♥♥♥♥ masks for the same price...wowPayday 2 again was a good game at the start with fair dlcs coming out every now and again just adding nice things here and there with some free updates, then they ramped it up and♥♥♥♥♥♥out dlc left and right to wring out all of the money they could.Then we hit the debacle of the completely overkill pack this♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ so to people who don't know there was a ""hype train"" event which let people buy the completely overkill pack to support overkill for $20 which gave NOTHING at the time except for 4 fairly cool looking exclusive masks and the promise of something later down the line.The whole hype train event was where people could buy some of the new dlcs in order to unlock rewards for the whole community later on kind of like this years crimefest now at the time i said that buying this thing was stupid as it would probably be♥♥♥♥♥♥♥but if only i knew how bad it would be...4.CRIMFEST 2015 MICROTRANSACTIONS AND LIESSo here we are at crimefest 2015 the annual event everyone loves cause free♥♥♥♥♥♥right yay! but no we got ♥♥♥♥ed over this year before i start to explain let me say overkill THEMSELVES said that1.There would NEVER be micro transactions in payday 2 and shame on people if they thought there would be2.ALL crimefest content would be completely FREE for all members of the communityWhat did we get day 1? Microtransactions safes with skins inside you can PAY to open, now i know what you're thinking CS:GO has this whats the problem? well 1 they lied on both points but 2 these skins are not cosmetic no no no some provide STAT boosts making them strictly BETTER than non skinned guns. To make it even worse you can get skins for DLC weapons that you DON'T own meaning you have to buy that dlc aswell what a piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥Later on they did add the ability for drills to drop in cards but it is very ♥♥♥♥ed up now let me explain it once a week you can get a drop being either a safe of a drill i have done this almost 4 times now and its been a safe every SINGLE time the drop rate is so stupidly low it may as well not exist is was just a bait by overkill to calm down the community after the outrage.They began censoring posts and removing discussions on the forums of people complaining and quoting how they were liers and scumbags, now yes the stupid ones with death threats and such should've been removed but some very reasonable threads also go deleted showing overkill trying to censor their community.Crimefest added virtually nothing cool with a weapon ""rebalance"" making pistols op as ♥♥♥♥ and shotguns unusable wow, next up a bunch of crappy masks yay... 3 new heists! nice oh wait no 2 were remakes that were basically just reskins with 1 new feature added for loot bag movement and maybe a slight tweak in layout still it was cool though i guess so gj ovk.Next up the actual new heist aftershock which was decent but short and fairly mundane with you getting you guessed it SAFES out what a ♥♥♥♥ing pisstake from overkill they knew what they were doing.5.DEVELOPERS GIVE NO ♥♥♥♥S ABOUT THE COMMUNITYNow the big and latest ♥♥♥♥♥how the secret reward for the completely overkill pack all those loyal fans who have waited over half a year after buying an overpriced dlc what do they get?A safe and a drill to get a weapon skin that looks like dogshit wow mass ♥♥♥♥ing outrage the mods have even left the forums due to scumbag overkills practises i cannot beleive what has happened.They also promised to take community feedback after the safe♥♥♥♥♥♥show and correct all mistakes at the END of crimefest keep this in mind, end of crimefest comes around and what did they do? ♥♥♥♥ all, they kept the safes and skins in completely unchanged but they removed the crimfest safe nice... and added ANOTHER SAFE IN ITS ♥♥♥♥ING PLACE.ConclusionsThe game WAS fun and its core is a good game to play with friends but ♥♥♥♥ing hell its a ruin now so just don't support overkill until they fix their♥♥♥♥♥♥DON'T buy drills and safes and maybe just maybe overkill will go back to the kick♥♥♥♥♥company they used to be and start giving a ♥♥♥♥ about their community."

Do you like having considerably more difficulty doing things people with DLC can do easily? then this game is 100% for you. if not and you actually like not having to fork out around £50 for DLC for a game you already paid for then sadly, this game is not for you.that's it you can leave now.long review for DLC the game:=====wall of text=====PAYDAY 2 started out as a genuinely good game, you could grab 3 friends and cause chaos doing meth deals, stealing gold bars and shooting some cartel in the face. it had an extensive customization of both your masks and weaponry, weapon attachments actually effecting how your weapon performs. and it had decently thought-out stealth missions that if completed correctly gave you bonuses. the game's progression system has you choose from 5 skill trees that each play a different role during a heist. the mastermind (a medic on steroids), the enforcer (obligatory tank), the technician (because tower defence), the ghost (2spooky), and the somewhat newer fugitive (2 smaller guns > one big gun). was PAYDAY fun at one point? most definitely. however, paid DLC has killed this game and overkill have incorporated gameplay elements assuming you have all the DLC making the game x1000 harder for people who don't own it. take captain winters for example; he is a special unit that has 7 - 8 shield units following him, and they all have ALOT of HP. he can be brought down easily with grenades, grenade launchers, heavy calibre sniper rifles- oh what? that's all DLC stuff? well sucks to be you good luck shooting though all those shields. yes that right GRENADES are DLC. not only that ive seen people get kicked from games because they don't have some of the DLC, or they've been ""underperforming"" because they don't have access to the weapons mods or weapons that DLC players have. some of the ""perk decks"" (secondary skill tree's) and ""assets"" (bonuses you can purchace with in-game currency to make heists easier) are DLC locked. The DLC weapon attachments are much better than the standard ones giving your weapon higher stats in some cases. The sad thing is, if you were to take PAYDAY 2 back to when it only had 1 - 3 DLC packs the game would still be fun for everyone. not to mention the ""lets nerf all the guns and only make them usable if you buy skins that are basically upgrades for them."" this is coming from someone who has 500+ hours on multiple accounts and owns the majority of the DLC. though they have put out some free content and props to them for that, but that doesnt exactly make the situation any better. So to sum up i cant recommend this game as it stands, i̶t̶s̶ ̶b̶o̶r̶d̶e̶r̶l̶i̶n̶e̶ ̶""̶p̶a̶y̶ ̶t̶o̶ ̶w̶i̶n̶""̶  it is entirely pay to win. and i can see more DLC and shady business practices coming in the future because f*ck the consumer we want money. spend your money elsewhere."

And I have to say, after doing a bit of research, that I am as confused and apalled as everyone else.For most gamers, microtransactions are  a virus that transforms our favorite games into something much worse. Either they eat away at our wallets to stuff greedy corporate pockets, or turn us away from otherwise enjoyable (usually multiplayer) experiences. For those of you who don't know, Overkill has recently added microtransactions akin to the keys and crates of tf2 and the skins of cs to your beloved Payday 2. This is despite multiple promises from Overkill to never add content of this sort.So although I have much fewer hours in this game than many of the others leaving negative reviews, I feel like this latest update is a somewhat terrifying representation of the blatant disrespect that some developers can show to the consumers of their products. No one wanted this. It was not a good idea. Even if you have never played Payday, hell even if you've never played a video game (what exactly are you doing here, anyway?) this should be offensive to you as a consumer of a product made by a group of people who are clearly testing how much they can get away with before people will stop giving them their hard-earned money. My experience playing Payday 2 has been only positive, but until this situation is addressed I can't leave anything other than a negative review here."

The DLC weapons that arent mandatory are just never used filler garbage whose only purpose is to justify the given price of the one weapon from the dlc that you need. So, Overkill isnt really bothered by the inharent unbalance of the game, they will just make one weapon that is better than any of the other counterparts for a DLC. And now they offer stat boosting weapons skins that you have to pay to acquire. You could buy this game, but Overkill is likely to screw you over by countiniously releasing better weapons that you have to pay for."

Bunch of crooks, lots of cops, guns to shoot, people to rob. Plain and simple. Yet enjoyable and i've spent about 300 hours on it. And then the second game was announced. More heists, guns and everything. Of course, i preordered it. And, unlike what Eric Cartman said, i didn't get a huge ♥♥♥♥ in my mouth. I got a game that still needed working on. Fix this, add that and it'd be even greater than the first part. But instad we, the players were like a Pavlov's dog or a maid in a hotel. The bell rang and she came. The dlc comes out and we buy it. At first we calmed ourselves:""Just a little dlc. Rather cheap. Devs have to eat too."" But then the bell rang more and more, slowly succumbing to buying more ♥♥♥♥. And the ♥♥♥♥ it was. ""New guns, melee, masks"" were, in fact, just another piece of either useless (because of OP guns) or owerpowered guns that made no sense in using others. Anyway, the guns were a lot, the heisters were a lot, the melee was a lot and the heists not a lot. But, more importantly, despite all dlcs nothing changed ingame. We could count on one hand's fingers the times we had to do something that didn't include tossing bags all over tha map. But as of recent times, dlcs began to be even ♥♥♥♥♥ier, meaningless than you'd imagine. And then the striking blow we got. Brutus finally stroke us in the back with the blade of microtransactions (which are not totally them, but still it's ♥♥♥♥ed up mechanic). Buying useless skins for a cost of few dlc's. And that's while there are entire mod communities that made skins, weapons and suits for the characters for free. But nooooo. Now you have to buy the game itself, dlcs, weapons skins and all that nonsense. I think developers should be remembered that this is a game of ROBBERY, HEISTS and not golden guns, pink masks and greeny-blacky-redy-blue dildoes as melee. And your common ""DON'T BUY IF U DON'T WANT IT, MOIT"" does not work here. Because would you like to eat an entire cake? Or only oranges that cake includes, apart from other ingridients (which are quite a lot).To be short: game was good, then became worse, and now it's like a money-eating vacuum cleaner.DO NOT BUY"

After all, People complain about micro-transaction so Overkill removes micro-transactions and then people complain about amount of DLC so Overkill makes all future content free Including Character packs (One of the major complaints when it came to buying DLC)But despite that the game is very fun with multiple different style heists for you and Friends to jump into and play either together or solo. Branching from Base bank jobs to Sky Diving into a secret Russian base to set of an EMP to stop an evil master mind.The gun play is well rounded and makes every gun fun to use, But when it comes to the harder Difficulties the game does limit your options to specific weapons and even some of those become hard to use because of their attachments being locked behind achievements that you might not even be able to acquire.My opinion on the ultimate edition is a little biased because of the fact that I already owned 70% of the DLC Before the update was even announced, But I do feel that this decision to lock all the DLC behind the ultimate edition will make people shy away from purchasing a rather good game.To summarise this review, I honestly believe that if you can look past the whole DLC Problem that a lot of other people are using to burn this game in effigy with, you’d find a game well worth playing.Game Score 8/10"

There was a time when everything in the game was free and no one had any advantage to getting kills, surviving longer or anything of that nature. As of the time I am writing this, Payday 2 has 16 PAID DLCS. Equating to a little over $85 (56 Pounds). If you add up the price of everything, including the game, it costs over $110 (75 Pounds) to own the entire game... Games are supposed to be sold, and what you buy is the entire game. Not with Payday. They know that you will keep buying the DLC packs and thats why they keep making them. At this point, with the amount of additional content they have released, they could have made a new ♥♥♥♥ing game.I am in no way saying that DLC is a bad thing, but your game should only have around 2-3 and they should cost according to what they give you. Payday 2 not only has WAY more than that, they aren't even worth the price. $6 per DLC... thats riddiculous, especially when you think about what you're actually getting. A weapon here, maybe a new melee here. This game has crushed itself and the only way I'll ever buy another OVERKILL game is if it's the next Payday. So all i want to say is ""have fun spending the equivalent of buying 100+ different songs from iTunes, multiple older consoles (Whose games are sure to not have any more ♥♥♥♥ING DLC) or maybe even A NEW ♥♥♥♥ING GAME!"""

Mechanically the game functions well with a number of obvious weapon imbalances, but the variable difficulty settings and custom loadouts ensure that you can find both the experience and playstyle to suit your tastes.Overkill, however, lied to its fanbase and has apparently chosen to treat any buyer as a dairy cow. The game which you already have to buy now sports microtransactions against the word of its initial advertising which you get to participate in through in-game rewards without benefiting from them even if you have no intent to buy the drill. As such, Overkill has proven that there is no guarantee to quality of service to its playerbase. This is worse than those poor ""early access"" buys for games that don't actually release. I recommend you walk away and spend your money elsewhere.Edit: Okay... updates have actually created more imbalances and several rather large bugs. Meanwhile Overkill has doubled down on unpopular policies, introduced more pay to win mechanics (relatively minor ones), and generally ignored feedback. A handful of heists have been broken, fixes have decreased the likelihood of bugs but not removed them, the cosmetic gambles have more RNG than just the base skins, and the community which once held the game together as an enjoyable experience has largely imploded. My recommendation remains the same: walk away and spend your money elsewhere. Game per dollar, this is no longer worthwhile."

I liked the solid post-launch support, and had no problem shelling out some cash for extra DLC.I don't have that much playtime, as I prefer to play with friends, and it is sometimes difficult to put a crew together. However, I had started playing more after my wife got the game through Humble Bundle.Unfortunately, due to some poor decision making and indifference on Overkill's part, I have uninstalled Payday 2.Summary:A first person shooter with gunfights reminiscent of the movie HEAT. Rob banks, jewelry stores, and more. Level up your character, learn new skills, buy and modify weapons.Positives:*Satisfying gunplay.*Many weapons and weapon modifications.*A wide variety of masks and aesthetics with which to customize them.*Multiple methods of accomplishing objectives.*Plenty of content.*Interesting progression choices.*An overall solid co-op experience.Negatives:This game was never perfect. But I always enjoyed it. The only negative worth talking about at this point is the fact that, during an event that was supposed to be a celebration of the community, Overkill added microtransactions to the game. The microtransactions are for drills, which unlock safes, which provide weapon skins that affect stats. There are a number of things wrong with this.*Almir Listo, the game's producer, promised this would not happen.*This is on top of the base price of the game, plus two years worth of paid DLC.*They actually compared it to Dota 2 and TF 2, both free to play games. They also compared it to CS: GO, which has a much smaller price of entry and contains weapon skins that do NOT affect gameplay.*The game's approval rating here on STEAM has dropped by almost 20%, and it has plummeted on metacritic, yet Overkill has done next to nothing in order to improve the situation.*Overkill added drills as loot drops after the first few days of the backlash, but they supposedly have ludicrously low drop rates.*Overkill's response (Almir specifically) to the negative reaction has essentially been ""the system is making us money, so suck it up and deal with it.""I, like many others, find this situation to be unacceptable. It is never OK for a game to have a retail price tag, paid DLC, AND microtransactions. I feel extremely bad for the veteran players and those that have purchased all of the DLC (I've bought most, but not all), as this is essentially a giant middle finger towards them. This debacle demonstrates a clear disconnect between Overkill and its playerbase, and in my opinion, it is only going to damage them in the long run. If they do something about this, I will re-install. Until then, Overkill won't get any more money out of me."

It had a ton of DLC to be cashed in on, which could be viewed as slightly problematic - but most of it was actually worth it (though having to buy a DLC in order to gain access to grenades... in a first person shooter game... a bit cheap, but they need money to survive - just like any other company). There were several clear ""dlc just for the sake of dlc"" (to make money kind of thing) - but nobody forced you to buy it.The problem with the game came in with a recent update (look at the reviews and feedback - in 48 hours the game's reviews dropped from 95% to 85% and are still crashing). After a couple of years of consistently promising the playerbase (a lot of whom weren't pleased with the mass DLC but were fine with living with it) that though we might have a ton of DLCs - we'll never resort to microtransactions.Well, as part of a giant ""event for the players that will grant a lot of free content for you"" they had introduced microtransactions... That was a ""gift to the players"".The cash grab was pretty obvious - leading up to the update the ""road to crimefest"" was all about drumming up hype about the game and getting old players to come back to it asap. Including a ""challenge"" of (a bit out of the clients' control) having 30 000 people simultaneously playing. A few days after that goal - we coincidentally receive the first reward. Microtransactions!All in all, the microtransactions update ruined not only the game and gameplay, but also the company. I really hope that it wasn't a last resort cash grab by overkill before things turning (fiscally within the company) for the worst - if that's the case then they have no option but to keep it on to survive. If that wasn't the case and they're still financially stable - maybe they will listen to the players (and draw conclusions from) the current PR disaster and remove the pricing on the microtransactions - making them ACTUAL free content as they had promised the player base.Stay away from the game if you're thinking about buying it based on old reviews or recommendations - the title is now a pay to win game (i wouldn't say full on 100% you MUST buy MTs to win, but a good 80%)."

Has become a pay to win cash grab and has been getting there for a few months now.Payday was a great game and Payday 2 expanded on that.The first one was more of a L4D experience that was about holding a place and surviving.The second one added good stealth, and new mechanics (some are super over used, bag packing and throwing are the worst ofenders)But it was a legitimate good time and online was a blast always being 3 seconds away from being caught and seriously underspecced for a front assault. But then the DLCs started coming out. (You must know the first game had just one DLC pack that gave you a character, a weapon, some masks, 2 heists and some skills so real bang for buck there) At first the DLCs were not great but added some fun features and even some free stuff like the Diamond store and the infamous update.But then they decided that that was not enough and Started dropping 1 char, 1 mask and some skin packs sure not great but you don't really needed that character to get anything you could get a new Heist for the same Price.But then they decided that the best weapons were going to be in the new DLC packs, and to add injury they started ""rebalacing"" the base and old DLC weapons, that meant that unless you wanted to be severely underpowered you had to get the DLC packs.And now after saying that they would not add micro-transactions they did, weapon skins, doesn't sound terrible I mean CS-GO did it and that is a good game. Well not here the skins are not cosmetic, that means that after nerfing the weapons to insane levels (pistols being more powerful than shotguns) you can either buy DLC packs of non nerfed ewapons or pay to get skins that will get whatever level you already had.That means a fun game just became a Pay to Win cash grab.P.D.

There is little more to be said about this game that hasn't already been said.While I take issue with the P2W strategy they are taking now it is only a minor boost, which while annoying isn't game breaking for me. My main gripe, and I have had it for a while yet I keep hoping to find some redeeming quality, is that this game is extremely repetative.In fact, so much of my complaints were made by Ben Yahtzee's review of Diablo 3, which is herehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0oZZRBIImQYou are a thief, and you need to steal bags of money (inferior pants), dealing with the same bland enemies over and over on the same maps with only minor variations. Half of the weapons are just slightly different models of one another, so you can go with Rifle 1 and have 40 accuracy and 50 stability or Rifle 2 with 50 accuracy and 40 stability.This is made worse when there are 30 heists, only 5 of which are worth bothering your time with. Moreover it lacks heists that might be interesting, like assassinations or even breaking into a Lobbyist headquarters and stealing their records. Add in the fact that there are only a handful of weapons worth using, and on top of that only a handful of builds that are viable in any significant way, it just becomes one huge monotonous mess. Finally to get to the max level you have to get to level 100, 25 times. All you get during that climb is a handful of masks that you will never get to see because you are wearing it.A good guage for this game, as amusing as it is, is the global statistics for the achievements. Only 65% have played a heist at all, 61% actually complete a heist and only 50% reach level 5. That is 15% of all players that quit before they spend, at most, 30 minutes leveling, and 4% bail within the first few minutes. Only 10% bother reaching to level 100. And that is if you are lucky and you can connect to a game longer than 20 seconds.This game is a FPS version of a dungeon crawler, except there isn't actually loot that is really worth farming. Add in the fact that they can't hear player complaints because they are holding all their DLC money to their ears means this isn't likely to change, at least not without another $20 DLC.Who am I kidding, they will just make Payday 3 so they can get $50 out of people."

Even worse though, my situation is probably pretty tame compared to a lot of people that play this game, and I can't even begin to fathom how disappointed some of those guys are.I'm not of the opinion that all microtransactions or DLC are evil, and I actually very much enjoyed a good portion of what OVERKILL put out as DLC before.  But when you actively punish the people that won't pay for extra content and move their rewards towards what might as well be lottery tickets, I can't help but feel like just a simple statistic.  To state the obvious, that bleeping sucks.  But statistics do not make up a community - people do.  And people have a hell of a lot more intelligence than businesses (or even other people, for that matter) give them credit for.At the heart of this issue, it's a matter of respect.  Regardless of how good the gameplay might be, there has to be at least a little respect towards the people that are keeping the developer afloat.  And if the people that have devoted hundreds (if not thousands) of hours into this game don't deserve some respect for supporting OVERKILL over the years, then it's time to move on from this abusive relationship to something else.  Plenty of budding developers are more worthy of your time and attention than this.But hey, at least the soundtrack is still pretty great!  Best of luck to Simon Viklund in his future endeavours  :-P-----------------------EDIT (10/28/15) - You might be wondering why I haven't changed this review, since drills have now become unlockable.  This system is certainly an improvement, but it still holds that same principle of swaying the power towards those that pay.  The weapon and pre-existing mod ""rebalancing"" is proof of that, as a variety of older weapons get the shaft in favor of a select few (Bronco, anyone?).  I also get the feeling that OVERKILL knew what they were doing with introducing microtransactions before softening it, as this is far from the first time they've introduced something before going back on it in a few days.Besides, that first surge of unknowing people during a free ten day period would be easy money.  And even with the review attacks and anti-Crimefest objectives going on, bad publicity is still publicity, right?  There's conventional business in a nutshell - maximizing profits through any means necessary.  We are only numbers and variables.Ultimately, I'm sticking to my word here, as I refuse to be one of those people that complains about a game and then goes back to it.  Straw on camel's back and all that.  I'm not going to ask you to do the same, only to be aware of OVERKILL's next moves.  Don't let them rob you blind without knowing what you're getting into.Oh, and support Simon Viklund still  :-P"

Bugs not being fixed since release, yet continued new DLC drops with new heists and weapons. It's the equivalent of making a shoddy foundation for a home, then building a multi-million dollar home.

Too bad, here's one of 25 atrociously designed skins, most of which are sub-optimal in modifications or just look like a baby vomited on to a modern art piece.To anyone who is thinking of getting this game, I ask that you use the recent events as a warning of what has yet to come. With many veteran players leaving in disgust, it's only natural that OVERKILL will want to refill the ranks with more naive players who wont hesitate to open their wallets for these P2W filth. It's clear that redemption is unfeasible and that OVERKILL have focused all of their efforts into monetizing and turning a profit from their players, however the means necessary.Because mo' money, mo' problems"

Normally, one of my favorite games, one that I sung praises for, loved dearly, and invested about 150 hours into doesn’t jump ship and sink the whole boat in the process.But hey, everyone needs a payday.Payday 2 was my favorite game. I played it for hours, leveled up, got achievements, even bought DLC way back when it was just starting to come out. Now, many people will be waiting to hear what I think of the new micro transaction debacle. A business model I personally don’t mind when done well.What I do mind is the loss and perversion of what use to make overkill great.I was a heister during payday 1. I raided banks and fought the cops when payday 2 was on the horizon. I loved their attitude, their commitment to the fan base, and the sheer love they put into the game. A love that was given, not sold.I soon saw free DLC for payday 2, I saw them listening to the fans to the point we soon heard the bone chilling war cries of ghosts once more. I found myself playing harder than ever before with players who actually cared about their fellow players rather than just leaving them for dead. I held my breath as we pulled off near impossible heists on overkill, I cheered from painting cameras as the last loot was dragged off, and I loved the game.I loved seeing the love they put into every bit of DLC. The weapons that were unlike the others in the game, not an easy feat. I saw the sheer amount you got by buying the drop dlc, and even had fun finding the hidden packs and running stealth missions just to find them all.Then crimefest rolled around, and we stole the show. The community banded together to get more and more. Cheering as more unlocks were freed for free. Faster than the devs dreamed. It was a good time to be a heister.However, to me things started to go downhill. Soon their weapons packs had far less content, more and more dlc maps were being churned out, and then a update that changed the game accidentally cost me my balanced character. At the same time a crimefest unlock happened that left a bad taste in my mouth and caused me to step back and take a break that would become permanent. The Wick update.Sure, the movie was good, but I kept up with the reviews to make sure their gamble payed off. Still, to me having your community work so hard to unlock an advertisement that just wasn’t right at all. Not when up against free guns, missions, and other love from the devs that left massively complex Easter eggs in bank heists.I cashed in my chips and went to other things, vowing to return. I hate having to take back a vow, but payday 2 as I remembered it isn’t around anymore.Imagine my heartbreak to hear about the micro transactions in the cards at the end of missions. The draws were already hard enough with people grinding missions just to hope for a good card. Those who say that the safes don’t take away from the game don’t know the value of those cards. A level up a mission early, a new skin for your mask, or that mod unlock you have been wanting since you bought the gun. Now, you got a safe that could contain a weapon skin with a chance to be one for your own gun, but the DLC fest became even worse with this.You could always unlock mods for guns you don’t own, so every DLC update brought you further from your dream gun. Now, the thing you paid close to 3 dollars for could just turn into a driving factor to buy DLC weapons that probably went against your playstyle. I know most of my cards went to those submachine guns I hated so much. Not to mention the steep price tag. 3 bucks for a single random skin that would change how the game works is bad, in payday 2 it oughta be a sin.The payday 2 I remember your team had to work hard, communicating every move with the hope, even at high levels, to pull off a mission. The guns were just tools for skill to use, now? Pay 3 bucks and hope the random number generator is in your favor. Then hope it’s a skin that fits your style, then hope its for a gun you own, then hope its for a gun you use, then hope its stats are actually useful for you. At the end of the day “its to give you an edge in the game” goes against payday 2’s grimy feel. Your team are supposed to struggle and work hard. Not have a gun magically help you win because it looks cool.Speaking of the community, lets get down to the meat of the issue. The community made payday 2 great. It was those of us who took time to go to underleveled missions to help powerlevel new guys. Those who worked to get the crimefest unlocks, those who put up with the issues and spread the word of overkill. Now, we are left bleeding out while our once allies toss our money into the back of a van. Holding up a finger as they drive off going back on promises they had made.It kicks me in the teeth that they had a guy do just that in payday 1.Now? We are marching down the street after them. Their own cops flinging hate like lead claiming that it was clickbait that made us mad rather than every change they made to milk every last penny they could from the franchise. Ignoring the hours we heisters spent popping safes to heist another day. The hours spent talking about what could be hidden secrets on forums. Going back on their word and even their business model they showed us on day 1. They robbed us, then tried to blame it on the media and the markets.Well, everyone needs a payday, and soon you will find out that cashing in early has left your table empty. Funny that they picked drills. The most unreliable, most likely to break, pieces of junk in the payday universe. The thing that has brought many parties to their knees desperately trying to keep running.Now, they will bring down the overkill team, the community leaving them alone to bleed out at the safes they so desperately wanted to get into for our money.  This aint hoxtalicious, this isn’t for the team, this is stealing from those that were supposed to be on your team. Now the drill is beeping, the team has left, the ghost are screaming and the riot shields are closing in.But you will be alone."

Yes, for the following reasons:1) I have a group of close friends that do not live close by and this is the easiest way to stay in touch and while Overkill has made several idiotic decisions, the game remains at least enjoyable with friends (if you have no friends to play this game with, avoid like the plague, ""single player"" is a joke unless you can withstand the mental torture of playing enough PUGs to find a group of people you enjoy playing with.2) I am going to squeeze every last bit of enjoyment out of this game for the money I misguidedly put into it.3) Shooting ""innocent"" civilians is cathartic."

This game is still really fun for me (I was able to jump right back in with minimal relearning of how things worked), especially with friends, but again I feel I need to bring up the fact that there is so much more DLC than when I stopped playing. It looks cool, but when the all the dlc is $100+ and the game itself is so much less expensive, I still can't rightly reccomend this game.In closing, if you are looking for a game to screw around with and do some cool heists with your friends I would recommend picking the base game up on sale. If you want to do the harder difficulties, it is extremely hard to get through without purchasing DLC so keep that in mind. Overall a fun game, but if you are a powergamer that loves challenging themselves, I dont know if I would pick this up unless you want to spend a bunch of money buffing your character for the hardest difficulty."

They did most of that.But then♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥on everything that I just said by lying towards us.Here is what I mean by that:Now, I'm been supporting PAYDAY 2 and Overkill since they released their pre-order beta during August 2013, and I gotta say, I liked the game back then. It was hard and difficult, but it's fun. Since the release of the game, I've been playing it during two years of it's current lifespan. Sure, I'm not gonna lie that it had some ups and (major) downs, but it still made me come back for each new update.However, over the years, these major downs I mentioned seemed to be getting more and more common, mostly because of disappointing Downloadable Content that are completely lackluster, reused content (despite Meltdown and the Alesso heists being the main offenders if memory serves me right), free content that fall under quite fast (I mean, a ♥♥♥♥ing shields with other shields covering him. Really?) and, as of recently, lying.Now, what do I mean by that?chuckleWell... Let me tell you a game called CS:GO. Now, I gotta be honest, I never played CS:GO back in it's early days, but I bet it was great--Okay, I'm just stalling here, PAYDAY 2 is copying CS:GO's weapon skin system but made it worse. It essentially makes the game underpowered unless you have the skins because. guess what?The skins each have stat boosts in them.Now that's fine, right? If they're unlocked in-game, yes. But through micro-transactions? Give me a picture of Almir Listo so I can throw knifes in his damn face. In fact,everydeveloper, because, they deserve. To. Die.And do you know what? I found out that back before the game was released, the developers said that they don't want micro-transactions in their game. Want proof? Heres two:http://www.gamespot.com/articles/payday-2-wont-have-microtransactions/1100-6410303/(the one above ain't a strong piece of evidence since David Goldfarb isn't working there anymore, but it still stands)http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?t=3127521Yeah.

I have enjoyed both games, and still do enjoy this. Going back to first game seems to be hard, as it feels different.This game is co-op game, so have some friends to play it with, or try to find someone to play it with you; there are loads of trolls in-game, and they keep kicking randoms out, so host your own games, or play with friends.Maps/Levels whatever you want to call them, are smaller than in first game, but there are loads of them unlike in Payday: The heist, which i still played over 200 hours. This is balanced with so called ""multi-day"" jobs/missions. You proceed days on mission, and get your money on last day. There are contracts that are one days, two days or  three days.Also, if you don't stealth, (which is possible in many maps),there are escape missions between days, where your objective is to survive for like 3-5 minutes so that new escape vehicle can arrive to pick you up. These tend to annoy me sometimes, as there are about 7 of them, but i always get either Overpass, or garage escape.Also, sequel introduces you bags. Loot bags. You have to actually carry stuff you steal, and it's big part of the game. Maybe little bit too much, but there are missions which aren't just about carrying bags from the bank to your van.As in first game, soundtrack is superior. Awesome work by Simon Viklund, again. It fits game perfectly, and they have added many songs prior to release. They have also had 25 updates so far, fixing and adding stuff. If there a update people don't like, overkill has done something about it. If you want the game, get it on PC, as console patching is slow...One of best co-op which you can have, if you allow ""some"" grinding and it being bag throwing simulator.Btw; you can move hostages these days ;)"

YES... but there is many reasons now why I'm not going to recommend it unless it goes on sale. first off the game has 2 many bloody DLCs. Now I like DLCs so idk I may buy some now and again when they go on sale and ON SALE only... But its still annoying the hell out of me every month or so Overkill releases another DLC again and again and again expecting another 4:99. Some of them are really well done such as Big Bank or character packs. But most of them are just a meh not to bothered or just boring or not worth the money unless again it goes on sale, another thing that (Excuse my language) pisses me off is the bugs and glitches...Cloakers are an enemy in the game that can down you in one hit when they charge and attack you...a bit like a hunter from L4D...however pretend that the cloaker is a ghost and can fly through walls...now pretend that cloaker is not a ghost but can still go through walls... it is redicolous and makes some heists almost impossible and the bots.....the GOD AWFUL BOTS....these bots are pathetic it comes to a point where my 2 friends have been jailed and then I go down by a bulldozer...bot takes a full 20 seconds to come over while he just stands and shoots walks on the spot or takes forever...then he starts to help me up but is shot numerous times which stops my revival and then I lose 5 more seconds...5 more seconds till I am jailed, he tries again and I'm literally 1 second from revival and then he stops again because of a shield constantly shooting him. I go into jail and we lose a projob deathwish that we were literally 2 seconds away from winning....this is a prime example of how terrible these bots are they need to be fixed and made stronger because unless U have 4 players you are going to have to suffer with one of these bots that are shocking and terrible.... and finally the god dam community...around 50% of people I meet on this game are nice and love having fun playing this like me...the other 50% fall under these factors1. KICK YOU AS SOON AS YOU JOIN CAUSE YOUR ""UNDERLEVELED"" OR ""YOU NEED TO BE 25 IMFAMY"" I hate it when theres a heist up that I wanna join and before I even get to type 'hello' I'm kicked straight away...seriously if you don't want me in set your reputation up cause kicking people when they join is just douchey2. RAGE QUIT AFTER THE FIRST FAIL...lets be honest you cannot be perfect but rage quitting cause of one fail.....thats just.....dam...3. EXPECT YOU TO HAVE CERTAIN THINGS. don't have this mask because you don't own the DLC?...get out of here (however when people ask nicely I'm ok with that and I understand but demanding is just stupid...)4. ASK YOU TO DO STUFF THAT IS NOT PREDUCTIVE. this is a team game that requires team work so when your asked to stay by the van and do nothing...in what way is that team work? (again exception is when you agree and know you cannot do a specfic thing such as stealthing shadow raid and you can help put bags in the van after others throw them to you)5. MOSTLY RUDE ""you ♥♥♥♥ing idiots idk why you play this ♥♥♥♥ing game""""WOW YOU SUCK AT THIS SO MUCH""""oh my ♥♥♥♥ing god ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ will you stop getting spotted by that♥♥♥♥♥♥head guard♥♥♥♥♥♥head ♥♥♥♥♥""""STUPID ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥""..........everyone makes mistakes and theres no need to rage like a 5 year old who cannot buy a toy they want in a shop6. KICK YOU JUST WHEN YOU ARE ABOUT TO FINISH...this is the lowest blow ever...you must have some serious problems if U think its clever to kick all off the users playing with you just as your about to beat the heist...you horrible person....7. HACKERS now I'll be honest in this game hacking doesn't really make peoples games worse it actually helps them by getting more money or pretty much getting an army of bulldozers at your side, but does that make it good?...nope....no it doesn't. Hacking can make super hard challenges about the same difficulty as me typing this sentance right now, makes things that are clearly impossible, possible and also can be annoying even if it helps players. I mean yes U may have like 300 skill points or 10 billion in cash...but did you get that fairly wihout installing anything except the game and the DLCs?....probably not (CONSIDERING YOU CANNOT GET 300 SKILL POINTS) if I see a hacker in my lobby I kick straight away since I don't want cheaters on any game, on a side note hackers are becoming less and less common due to the fact that overkills cheating system is improving...but my friend being called for a cheater by ""throwing too many grenades* when in fact he has been throwing NO GRENADES??? erm ok?8. TF:GO DAY 2.......nuff saiddespite all this it has some amazing music that I love to listen to, its a great multiplayer game thats fun for everyone I love playing it still but these things sometimes make the game annoying...unplayable and just redicolous. At the end of the day. I'd like to continue playing it and I do since I still find it fun...but I don't reccomend it unless its on sale...DLCs I will only buy if they are on sale (MAYBE)....and overall the game can get repetitive...Press F to open door. Press F to bag money Press F to press button.........ok enough.2/10 I'm Rich! - Overkill 2013-present (dam DLCs...)"

,Not Recommended,218620,18488084,"Posted: 15 October, 2015",all,Bob Ross,"This review is primarily to highlight the rather unsavory relationship between PAYDAY 2, DLC and the PAYDAY 2 Steam Group...PAYDAY 2 suffers from a glut of DLC. People argue that it's keeping the game alive, and I would agree. It's figurative life support. The game itself is still unoptimized after several years and new content is mostly of the filler variety. The model seems designed to maximise revenue by selling ASSETS as opposed to developing CONTENT which is time-consuming and expensive. This results in a repetitive game that this reviewer feels little desire to experience again...So why the review? Today is Crimefest in PAYDAY 2. I know this because I'm a member of the PAYDAY 2 group. I'm looking for some way to leave the group, because I get noxious event notices from this group at a regular rate. The group has a staggering amount of members, over 3 million. I suspect the popularity of this group is driven by the ""Free Items"" you are promised by joining the group. Some of these items are pure trifles, but some (Judge Shotgun, weapon mods) are powerful, useful, and have no vanilla equivalent. They are in essence a part of the game, but merely buying the game will not net you these things. You must join the Steam PAYDAY 2 group and endure their advertisement scheme, and that is purely what it is: pop-up advertising in disguise, using Steam's platform.So, I'll be quitting the group and the game, since the game itself is fairly mediocre, and the ""Free In-Game Items"" marketing strategy is noxious. I cannot recommend this game."

,Not Recommended,218620,19365553,"Posted: 29 November, 2015",all,Pagey2,"Really good game, nice feel to the mechanics, no bugs (that I've experienced), the shooting and 'cross-hair splash' is smooth and replay ability options are plenty. However this game is ruined by the micro-transactions / excessive DLC embedded within the game.I have no problem with DLC generally and don't consider it a dirty word. Games like Total War have the right balance when it comes to DLC. TW allows you to buy additional extra units which (and this is the key part) which compliment but do not comprise part of the core game.The DLC placement in Payday 2 can be summed up in two words; unapologetically obnoxious. To illustrate how far the excessively embedded and limiting DLC permeates the core game check out the current range of weapons in the game;> Assault Rifles; 20 options (but 10 of these you need to pay to access)> Special Weapons; 9 options (but 8 of these you need to pay to access)> Shotguns; 8 options (but 3 of these you need to pay to access)> Sniper Rifles; 6 options (however ALL 6 of these weapons require additional payment to access)> LMG; 5 optoions (but 4 of these you need to pay to access)This is just the weapon choices of course, other sections of the game such as (but not limited to) skills and perks are also significantly restricted until further payment is made. There are even weapons that can only be unlocked if you buy a completely different game on Steam.To sum up, as someone who is new to the Payday 2 game series but doesn't know as much about the first game, nor the previous development staff comments and broken promises etc; it makes me wonder why the developers didn't release this game as a free-to-play game which would then reflect peoples expectations on the level of DLC in this game. In short the game itself is pretty good but marred by the excessive DLC. If anyone is wavering on whether to buy this game or not I would ask them to consider the 40% of the game they are not going to be able to access (yet be reminded of constantly) in the game."

However I noticed a strange way the dlc was becoming less and less usefull. I understand running out of ideas and I wouldn't mind buying them as long as it kept me immersed which it did. However when overkill introduced The Butcher, it went downhill fast. The ak/car mod pack was complete garbage and bomb heists were quite boring. They brought themselves back up a small amount with the Golden Grin Casino and The Sokol character pack. Ninja pack passed with the community. The Chivalry pack came out and boy did it rile us up greatly until overkill calmed us with upcoming crimefest. We worked so hard to complete these challenges and we achieved victory. However when the vault opened and we saw what it was holding, we were filled with rage. Overkill promised no micro transactions and stabbed us in the back. It is one thing to add skins, its another when they change stats. Payday had a once thriving community where joy and cheer spread through everyone. Now it is filled with hate and is slowly crubbling. Now you can barely have a decent time in this game without buying dlc. It is true, payday is entering the end of its life span. But we did not expect it like this."

I'm an offline gamer at heart and I've never really played any other online game before. When Payday 1 went free during the last event I figured id take the plunge and try it just with my uncle. A week or so later I found out Payday 2 had a demo, which played much better than the first. The week after the GOTY edition released.We bought Payday 2 GOTY edition in December 2014 and although I only play it with my uncle,  I initially found it to be quite fun. The incredible soundtrack by industry veteran Simon Viklund really amps up the atmosphere in any heist. There are a few varied heists ranging from a small jewellery store and a branch bank to the grand “big bank”.I'd play for a few weeks then go offline for months, coming back online when killing floor broke itself again or when an event came out, but after a few months of this arrangement I found the levels becoming quite tedious; we had already done every heist many times and grinding for experience and cash to make the $200,000,000 for infamy was beyond irritating. We were both looking forward to Crimefest until that fateful 15th October update, but I’ll talk about that later on.I’ve put together points, good and bad, purely about the game. Note these are from my experience with the game up until 15th October 2015 when Payday stopped working for me, so I cant really talk about the new features in detail.The Good:Top notch music from Simon ViklundSolid and satisfying Gunplay (at least until the rebalance hit)Nice weapon modding systemFairly addictive gameplay (For a while)decent voice actingSome interesting Heists (Hotline Miami, Rats, Meltdown)The Bad:Microtransactions added and likely to be more in the futureBroken and missing animationshorribly implemented and unbalanced SWAT Turrets that shaft bots and new players alike very easy (Probably more now with the Crimefest “rebalance”)rapid influx of new characters leaves many older ones without voice lines (aka “HEY YOU, FOLLOW ME”)DLC almost essential to play (I have the GOTY edition which includes most pre 2015 DLC)Lacks the “Hollywood Movie” feel of the originalPoor offline mode support (offline mode with no connection cant see if you are in the community group, community items lock and may disappear from guns)So, Crimefest 2015, Overkill's yearly event.As you likely have already seen from the many thousands of negative reviews, this event was not received well. To give you a clear idea of what was released and when, I have made some notes as I saw it:Day 1Microtransactions and community uproarGame breaking “Unknown Steam error” for many users on many operating systems (including myself)massive weapon rebalance (haven’t tried this but I hear shotguns have gone downhill)Day 25 Masks (some were bugged and floated above the character's heads)No fix for unknown steam errorDay 3Aftershock heist (buggy, no engine sounds on truck)No fix for unknown steam errorDay 4crime.netupdates, hostage trading (sounds good but I haven’t seen it in action)Still no fix for unknown steam errorDay 5Bipods and LMG (bipods were bugged, apparently teleport players around and make them invisible)Still no fix for unknown steam errorDay 6First world bank (many bugs, holes in level)Still no fix for unknown steam errorDay 7Preferred character and new music (sounds good but I haven’t seen it in action)Still no fix for unknown steam errorDay 8Swat van turret upgrade, 4 new masks, more safes (SWAT van does more damage, RIP Bots)Still no fix for unknown steam errorDay 9Slaughterhouse heist and 2 more masks (not heard much on this one)Still no fix for unknown steam errorDay 10Jump animations and 4 “meme” masks (I’m not kidding)Still no fix for unknown steam errorEvery day that went by seemed like a bizarre joke on the community who made this game what it was.Now I’ll move on to Overkill themselves. I think it's fair for any newcomer to know what they are getting into. Overkill have often been accused of greedy behaviour, each DLC pack seems to be more powerful than the last and there always seems to be some obvious bugs included which should have been spotted by any QA tester. Take for example the ninja pack, the sniper rifle had a misaligned sight where it would be off centre and as far as I know they never fixed it yet managed to pump out 2 more DLC's in the meantime.Then there’s the whole Crimefest fiasco. The community worked hard for weeks completing challenges to unlock FREE content at this years Crimefest event. I have never seen a community come together like this, people were organising mass logins, hosting games dedicated to progressing on the most tedious challenges, basically everyone was excited.Then Day 1 came. I got Payday updated first then tried to run it. “Unknown steam error” it replied. First I read the bug reporting forum and found a thread about it. I then went to the front page and noticed the announcement. Not being able to read it during the update (my pc locks up if disturbed during Payday updates) I hadn’t seen what had gone on in the comments. A real frenzy had broken out, between the ASCII art posted every third comment, I managed to piece together what happened,Microtransactions.I should disclose at this point that I am thoroughly against microtransactions as I see them as no different from the horror stories you hear about in the news where kids spend thousands on some mobile game. I don’t play TF2 or CS-GO in online mode so I don't participate in their microtransactions and any game that has them would be a definite avoid in my bookAfter day 1 any reasonable person would have expected overkill to make some kind of statement but instead they kept up a wall of silence for some bizarre inexplicable reason. Over the course of the event Overkill kept silent as the community went into self destruct. Any reasonable company would have suspended the event after day 3 to make a statement and try to make things right, Overkill waited until the very end to make a statement but instead did a Reddit Q&A. Must be the “indie” thing to do.Overkill did the Q&A and to my utter disbelief they placed the blame on the community and media sites, avoiding questions and spouting nothing but thinly veiled PR and the usual passive-aggressive “we understand but you are wrong” trash they have been doing for months, needless to say I'll be uninstalling Payday 2 shortly.Not since Epic games renounced the PC have I seen a company with such a burning contempt for its loyal fans who have made them what they are. Payday 2 is a multiplayer focused game, make no mistake so it baffles me beyond belief that Overkill would deliberately destroy the community like this just to make a quick buck since multiplayer games rely on a strong community to keep the game active. For many it seems to be the straw that broke the camel's back.With all that said,  I’d advise anyone still looking to buy Payday 2 to be extremely cautious. At it's core Payday 2 is a fun experience, but with the addition of microtransactions it's likely to get worse and more like a F2P game over time in my opinion, which is unpleasant considering the price of the game and the DLC packs are fairly expensive. If this behaviour does not discourage you and you are still looking to get this game, then you will want the GOTY edition as it includes all the content prior to 2014's “the bomb”. It DOES NOT include all DLC, so “the bomb” onward will need to be bought separately.I am a man of my word and if Overkill removed microtransactions and made a full apology for their behaviour with none of the usual quirks the community has come to expect of them then I'd consider returning."

Particularly the simple abandonment of the game for Xbox 360 (note, I play on PC) reveals the uncaring, callous attitude of the devs towards their playerbase. Often, they are downright rude on social media in response to questions, complaints, even suggestions by would-be fans. (The above quotes are taken from responses on Steam and Twitter). Yes, of course, most people online are probably d##kheads, but when the developers respond in such a fashion to people that are legitimately hoping to help make the game better..... There is little respect left for said developers and little hope left for the product they're pushing.The developers at Overkill have kept stating over the years that they are an ""independant"" company, perhaps using that as an excuse for not fixing core game mechanics or the lack of attention to consoles due to being supposedly small and""independent"" (???) In reality they are partnered with and are owned by parent companies, demonstrating that perhaps they are simply lazy and greedy, and most certainly don't care about the people that buy their game.The corruption of the game nowadays goes far beyond not fixing broken mechanics: Things such as poorly designed flashbangs spawning directly on top of players with no warning or the ability to do anything about them (sometimes bangs going off sequentially so that players remain blind for an absurdly long time) - have been around since the BETA (!). Cop hitboxes simply do not have arms and legs (in a -mostly- shooting game released in 2013!! What.) Tasers still stun players through walls, end rewards are eternally random drops, so that getting a particular weapon mod may never happen, etc... All these and much more are just a given that the players have grudgingly accepted as they continued to play the game (though there are some who have simply got fed up with the repetative slog and never improved gameplay and stopped playing, good on them - I guess in some way I'm still naively hoping the guys at Overkill will grow up and make Payday 2 as great as it could have been).As I was saying before I went on a tangent cataloguing a few of the broken mechanics; beyond having its many flaws remain unfixed, Payday 2 has become a giant billboard. The developers' ""secret reward"" for one of it's annual Crimefest events was a very poorly made playable character John Wick (the character model looks nothing like Keanu Reeves), as an advertisement for the upcoming movie. Many players were♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off that the top reward for the event was an advertisement for something else and added nothing to the game itself. Now, with the most recent Crimefest, the developers have released safes (crates), for which players need to buy drills (keys) with real money if they wish to open them. In other words, the game has hit a new low with the introduction of microtransactions, despite in 2013 the devs stating that they would never introduce anything like that. Best part is, they advertise Crimefest as completely free content for all their players. That brings the Hypetrain fiasco to mind, though I have dragged this on long enough and won't go into detail on that here, suffice it to say that Overkill false-advertised and acted real scummy. Regarding the chests/keys; due to outrage from the players, the next day after release of microtransactions the devs seem to have ""relented"" and stated that they now made drills (keys) potential drops as random rewards. The chances of that happening? Your guess is as good as mine at the moment. 0.001% per mission is still a chance, technically.Another example of the way the game devs have used their game to advertise other products is the promotion of Hotline Miami 2 via a payed DLC which would unlock Hotline Miami's main character as a playable character in Payday 2. The Alesso Heist payed DLC and empty in-game hype about the developers' production of the Walking Dead game are other further examples of blatant self-promotion. Many of the DLCs that are now being released for the game (paid or not), have some kind of advertising with them - I mean, need I even mention the Chivalry Medieval Warfare Pack DLC? And that's a problem: Rather than leaving the game ""independant"", as the devs still like to call themselves, and fixing and improving it, Payday 2 acts as an ad for anything else Overkill is involved in and can get a few bucks from.Now that the concept of stealth in the game has basically been abandoned and Overkill are releasing more and more (paid) DLCs with a focus on weapons and promoting other games and whatnot, it has become pretty clear that the gameplay itself will never be improved. There are only two or three heists worth running for veterans of the game that give decent rewards in terms of XP and money, and while a new player will have fun for a little bit when they start the game, they will soon realize how quickly the game becomes shallow, boring, and repetative, not to mention mechanically underwhelming.I wouldn't outright say ""don't buy"" - it really is fun at first. Get it when the game's on sale; it happens often enough, since Overkill keeps trying to boost its numbers without actually improving their game. But really, look up Overkill Payday 2 on Reddit, and see what the top topics are. For the most part, it's along the lines of ""F##k Overkill"". I like to tell myself that I still occasionally like to play the game, but just playing it for a bit makes me feel so slimy about it, and annoyed about so many of its small and even major flaws that could EASILY be removed or remedied, if the devs cared."

It uses the dated Diesel engine (which powered Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter 9 years ago) and it really shows its age. Many actions like lock picking and bag pickups have no accompanying animations, giving the game a low-budget feel. The enemies have no hit boxes on the arms and legs. Environment physics are limited. The Source engine would've been a better choice, but obviously they didn't want to use an engine that would enable users to create their own heists. Look, Overkill, I could even appreciate the low-budgetness of the first game because you guys were small. But now that it's no longer the case, put some effort into making the game look modern, ffs.EDIT: Almir Listo of Overkill held an AMA on reddit after Crimefest:https://www.reddit.com/r/paydaytheheist/comments/3q53ms/crimefest_is_over_ama_discussion_with_almir_on/Just look at the number of downvotes on every single one of his posts. That should tell you all you need to know.Let me begin by saying that I thoroughly enjoyed Payday 1. I played every heist to death and bugged my friends to get it so we could all play together. I was also very impressed by their DLC strategy - while I would've preferred it to be free (or better yet, have mod tools), I found it quite fair that they allowed non-buyers to play the DLC heists as long as the host of the lobby owned the DLC.When Payday 2 was announced, I felt that I just HAD to support this awesome, indie Swedish studio. I paid $50 USD to preorder it, and had a blast with the beta and the initial release of the game.In fact, I enjoyed the game so much that I drove two and a half hours to Seattle to attend PaydayCon in August 2015 and shake hands with Almir Listo and other staff. I even dressed up in a payday costume for Halloween last year.However, there were ominous signs even from the beginning, which I chose to forgive at first, but not anymore:- Grindfest system to unlock new equipment and modifications. I shamelessly used a trainer to get around this (just to be clear, I did not illegally unlock DLC I didn't own, nor did I actually cheat during public games by using god mode or whatever). The restriction of weapon mods to stupid card drops was particularly frustrating but I thought ""hey, I can just use the trainer, so no problem"". I am not the only one who did this. Lots of people used a trainer to skip grinding, and did not actually cheat during gameplay.- DLCs started offering less and less content. It's fine if $7-$10 buys you several heists AND weapon packs. But $5 per weapon pack and $7 per heist? No thanks. Yes, many weapons and heists were released for free (i.e. Hoxton Breakout, Car shop), but the more spectacular ones like Big Bank (which I admit I loved) were paid. I did buy quite a few DLCs since my friends were able to join for free (following the fair model from the first Payday), and now I regret it.- Console users were getting shafted when it came to support. Now, it's tempting to think ""Ha! Suckers, now it's your turn"", but despite being a PC fanboy, I firmly believe that all customers, regardless of platform, are entitled to support and respect from the devs. The last-gen console versions are basically abandoned, with no DLC and many bugs unfixed. The Crimewave edition for the Xbone and PS4 was broken from day one and it took months for a fix to come out. And then we have that rather offensive tweet from Melanie Schneider who told a console user to ""switch to another platform and f***ing play it there."" Yes, the PC version has gotten an enviable level of support that is rare in this world of console ports, but that doesn't give the devs the right to blatantly insult console players like that. Just seehttp://i.imgur.com/wiiZxGk.jpgorhttp://i.imgur.com/hkLHdlU.jpgfor a concrete example of how unprofessional they are.And then, in October 2015, to celebrate Crimefest (the game's birthday), Overkill personally breaks an earlier publicly stated promise by including microtransactions which actually boost your stats. In a game that already has a $20 USD base price with DLCs that can total over $100. This is not a free-to-play game, and even some free-to-play games go the extra mile to AVOID stats boosters, e.g. Team Fortress 2 and Planetside 2 ensure that microtransactions are purely cosmetic.Here's one of the announcements where they explicitly promised no microtransactions:forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?t=3127521Even ACTIVISION, the most hated publisher, never said ""Hey, we'll have ranked dedicated servers in Modern Warfare"" before announcing that it wouldn't. Sure, fans rightfully expected the feature, but there weren't any explicit broken promises.I regret to say that I have to change my review to a negative one until Overkill gives an acceptable response to the community backlash.In the meantime, if you want a co-op heist simulator reminiscent of movies like Heat or The Town, play the first game which at least was made with some integrity."

I got really really hyped about it, I'd watch videos, study maps etc. They hype didnt die. I played it basically non stop, met couple of really nice people there some of which i still talk to this day.But then, the game changed.They started introducing DLC content. Thats okay, a dlc or two to make them get a bit more money. Only, it didnt stop. The DLC content started coming out like factory, swords, guns, guns #2, mods, mods #2. There was no end to this.I decided to let it pass since i enjoyed the game with friends, making builds to traverse harder difficilties in all the possible ways. But not anymore.Recently micro-transactions were included. Pay for a drill, pay for the safe (with real money) then open them to get a chance at a weapon skin... THAT WILL INCREASE YOUR STATS. Think about it. How? Why? To make it even better, people had to work, grind for this hard. There were challenges we had to complete (as a part of Crimefest 2015) to unlock P2W content.It was stated this game will NEVER EVER have this kind of payable content.-10/10 Would not recommend.Don't get this unless you support pay to win game model.

I then installed the game again when i felt like playing again and from 257 gb (I installed Overwatch in between those times) went to 218 gb. I don't know what happened that my payday 2 was so big, I didn't have any mods either, only LUA mods such as Matty's Card Drops. Either way, 30 gb is a lot for a game of this quality.Other than the mentioned stuff, it's only minor negative effects (Difficulty being too easy, insane spawn rates, tedious bag moving, etc)On the positives, not much to say, I like the music a lot, the map design on all heists (except bomb: forest and birth of sky) and the VO.

What recieved has fallen far short of the promises made before this game launched, and now adds micro transactions into this game.as of 11/4/2015, the safe house has no customization.  the recent weapons rebalance has eliminated the differences between weapons, and reduced customizations to those weapons to almost nothing.  Stealth has been wrecked by limiting pagers to 4 PER TEAM instead of 2 base +2 per player with a perk.  Sleath guards also spawn an additional guard after 4 pagers answered or any combination of cameras destroyed and pagers equal to 4 called the inspector which no current players comprehend.  Guards can see players through walls, walk through them, and at times not register if they have been shot dead or not.  Stealth is broken and unplayable.The recent micro transactions have stat boosts higher than the new customization stats, which require a drill to be bought for 2.49.  The current price of safes is $0.04 each, because no-one wants these items, or to pay for the drill to open them.  Even if you have no problems for paying this to open the safe, the skin has an 80% chance to be for a weapon that requires DLC to unlock.  So, you pay at every step of the way for this game, Initial price, each DLC (grenades, snipers, shotguns, nearly 8 additional characters from the starting 4, max players of 4 per game (why? 12 on a heist would be better.)this game is a cash grab skinner box, nothing more."

With the latest update, they've made the carnal sin of adding microtransactions, so not only do you have to pay for the game and additionally for the DLC (If you want 80% of the weapons, achievements, heists, characters, etc. that should come with the base game), but now you have to pay additionally ot unlock even more weapons, which, surprise, introduces a pay-to-win system with stat boosted weapon exclusives. ""Balancing"" patches completely botch the mechanics through the entire life of the series, starting with the infamous stealth patch which rendered numerous heists uncompletable in full stealth.Overkill has promised to not do these things, and have done them. They consistently lie about their work; Almir especially, with the top transgression being the introduction of microtransactions, precisely as he said he would never do.Do not buy this game. Do not buy anymore DLC if you already have. Stop giving Overkill money for the worst business practices in the industry. We do not need for this to be the example set for the rest of the industry.

How do a group of people bring a community together with the promise of free content for coming together and completing challenges and then give them a large middle finger by adding MICROTRANSACTIONS in the FIRST UPDATE? Or any update at all? With all of the DLC this game has, along with the fact that this game was already paid to begin with, microtransactions are the LAST thing this game would ever need. But in the eyes of Overkill devs, it was the first. The skins themselves aren't even needed. There are hundreds, if not thousands of weapon skins that are downloadable for free as mods. Who the hell told them that charging people for skins was a good idea? Even then, these skins aren't just cosmetic. They also give your weapons stat bonuses. If they had taken the CS:GO route where all skins are purely cosmetic, there would most likely be a lot less complaints. But they have added statistics to these weapons. This game is starting to scream Pay-2-Win. I wouldn't be surprised if the final ""reward"" for Crimefest is making PAYDAY 2 a free-to-play game.

Like buying the game and spending over a hundred bucks on DLC isn't enough. It's been even worse for console gamers with multiple releases and postponed updates. Pretty much a bunch of broken promises to the community left and right across all consoles and PC. I personally believe that Overkill needs to spend time polishing and rebuilding their game and going back to the good heisting game everyone liked rather than keep pumping out DLC and adding silly weapon skins. Just my personal opinion on the weapon skins. I know I don't have to use them, but the way to aquire them is just absurd.

The game has a big opportunity of giving people countless hours of fun with friends, and I was even considering picking the game DLC thing up when it was to be on sale during the crimefest.I played this game for many hours online and much more offline when I was having a hard time with my last internet service provider (Just awful services out there), and I was having a good time.

Once I manage to ghost a level (Election Day), I was feeling very rewarded (personally).So why am I not recommending this game? Microtransactions. Weapon skins that actually give stats with no downsides (Unless your personal taste in colours are hurting you). The worst thing is that this was something that was promised not to be in the game so having it introduced as some sort of four year celebration thing is more than just a subtle thing of an issue.Until this debacle is resolved in a way that is not in an anti-consumer fashion, I will not recommend this gamehttp://www.destructoid.com/payday-2-adding-microtransactions-after-developer-said-it-wouldn-t-315725.phtml"

Two years ago, we were told point-blank that there were no plans for microtransactions, and ""shame on [us]"" for thinking otherwise (actual words used by Almir Listo). Another (former) staff member specifically said ""no microtransactions,"" vehemently. Almir has publicly stated that he was shocked to see the negative reaction to breaking this promise--even though he also admits that this was, in fact, him ""going back on his word."" But despite the substantial backlash, and the ~20 percentage point drop in PD2's review score on Steam, he has said that ""statistically"" and ""economically,"" the system is doing what they want it to do--in other words, it's making money, and they don't care if most people hate it as long as a handful use it.As Overkill's public representative, since the company apparently lacks a true PR employee, Almir claims that the company sees nothing wrong with microtransactions because the base game is balanced for not having them, so it makes no difference if they're present for a few players. However, veterans who have done the math have observed that, ""coincidentally,"" the skin stats are just the right size for pushing many guns over a breakpoint (a number where a sharp change in effectiveness occurs). E.g. if an enemy has 80 health (a typical number in PD2), then unless you do at least 40 damage per shot, you have to hit that enemy at least 3 times to kill it. Even with maxed out stats and the best mods, many ""rebalanced"" weapons cannot reach such a breakpoint, coming in 1 or 2 damage short...and skins are the only remaining way to make the difference. So, if you don't bother getting the skins, you'll want to focus on accuracy instead--because in a shots-per-kill sense, there's no difference between 39.5 damage and 28 damage, both equate to 3 shots to kill an 80 HP target. But, again ""coincidentally,"" the weapon rebalance sharply dropped the accuracy of most weapons. Hard to accept the claim that the game balance only assumes the base game when the numbers reflect significant benefit for having skins...and a direct detriment to the main strategy for people that don't use them.Almir has also alleged that, in order to keep making content, they need additional revenue sources--yet both Overkill and their publisher, 505 Games, have consistently rated PD2 as one of their best and most profitable products. Conveniently, Almir tries to play both sides--claiming that they're an independent company, and thus need to have extra revenue to stay afloat...while also claiming that they need the extra revenue to keep their promises to the company they're dependent on, 505 Games. He's also noted that their staff has tripled since launch, and that they need more money to pay all of these people. Why should we have to put up with the odious presence of ""Pay 2 Win"" content in order to support Overkill's unwise hiring practices--why did they even hire 200% more employees if they couldn't afford to pay them? The only answer I can see is because they expected to squeeze even more money out of their userbase.Finally, PD2 was already getting mild flak for the rate and cost of DLC, even a year ago; people parodied a line from the Hoxton Breakout DLC, ""Five bucks for parking? That's robbery!"" Swap ""parking"" and ""DLC"" and you have a winner! Overkill already offers over $100 of DLC, even after they permanently reduced prices for older content (including the base game). Now, in addition to (still) being priced just like a regular game, and having a long list of paid DLC, they're adding microtransactions as yet another revenue stream--a revenue stream they don't need, because the game is already profitable. This is something we as consumers cannot allow to happen--if this becomes a trend, then every single game will try to milk its players for all they're worth, $60 at launch plus $20 day-one on-disc DLC plus another $100 extra DLC plus hundreds of nickle-and-dime microtransactions, so that to really experience the game you're now paying $200 or more. It has to stop, now, before it can become a menace, not just to this game's community, but to the video game industry as a whole.Send Overkill a message. Tell them we won't accept shady money-grabbing. Show them they were wrong to think the community would accept this. Expose them, when they make duplicitous and deceptive claims. Demand honesty, humility, and transparency.I played PD2. I had some fun. Unless and until some major, major changes happen, I won't be coming back."

And, up until about a year ago, I really loved it.But that's changed. From the end of last year, Overkill have steadily♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥away every ounce of goodwill I had towards them. The amount of DLC has gone into overdrive, while console players continue to have an almost unplayable game. Im expected to shell out ridiculous amounts of money for content that often launches broken or breaks other parts of the game. The hype train stuff was underwhelming. The devs have consistently failed to make new heists that extend beyond 1 or 2 days (though most of them are, admittedly, pretty good).And the safe drops are the last straw. I loved Payday because it had such a tightly-knit community fostered by game devs who really seemed to care about delivering a quality product. That seems to be completely over now.So, in short, I refuse to be treated like a total chump. I won't be supporting Overkill at all from now. Am I gonna miss out on some great DLC? Probably. Do I care? No. Unless there are some major changes at Overkill, this ship has sailed"
