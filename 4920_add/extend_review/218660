Plenty of destruction, weapon upgrades and has a few different types of scenarios.  I got about 5 hours of gameplay out of it.  You'll probably get more if you want to master every level.  Graphically it is to be expected at this price range.  Not a ton of replay value, as soon as I beat it I was good, but fun temporary time killer."

When I'm in the mood for this type of game I just keep going level after level. Probably the best 2D tank game I've come across and the particle effects are pretty good. It takes a while to get used to controlling the tank but once mastered you forget about it. Nice albeit simple upgrading system too. Plays perfectly on a Ubuntu laptop with intel graphics so doesn't need much."

Probably won't play it again, but you never know. The game is quite enjoyable. The level sizes are decent although unless you're going for achievements you don't really go all over the map in most levels.  I never used a controller for this game, as it's far more smooth driving then say Renegade Ops, but I could see it being nice so I leave that to personal preference.The power-ups and upgrades are definitely cool, as I found out you will probably use most of them a couple times depending on the level. The side missions are a nice touch as well.The simplicity of this game is great, it's a straight forward game and really easy to pick up. The only flaw I see with this is long term replay value.7.5/10 due to no long term replay value but very much worth it especially on sale"

This alone is not the reason I am leaving a negative review, as even great games can have a hiccup from time to time. The problem is that after each crash I have lost a lot of progress - missions that I had completed were no longer complete and money / skill points I had earned were gone.  The game does not have a manual save feature as far as I know, and if autosave is the only option then it should autosave after each mission attempt. The crashes were not frequent, but for me that isn't the point. This is a sloppy game design and programming choice in a game that is otherwise well crafted.  If this problem were to be addressed I would certainly reccomend this game, but as it stands I don't think the game is worth putting in time that can be too easily lost."

76561198006476640,Recommended,218660,19091470,"Posted: 15 November, 2015",all,Morphy,A quality title from Cobra Mobile. You play an allied tank in WWII with your tasks varying from level to level but always include mowing down the nazis. The game seemed to slow down in fullscreen view but played nice windowed. It's got plenty of levels and the game remains really playable throughout. Playing on the harder difficulty makes it quite challenging towards the end. I think the top-down graphics suit the game well. Good stuff.

If you're looking for a casual game that you really don't have to put your mind into too much - this is your choice. You can play the game through by being sloppy and straight-forward or if you're up to it you can go all-perfect on it. I have put somewhat twelve hours into this game and that was just the single-player campaign - with all Steam achievements collected, though. The game offers some replay value by giving you an arcade challenge mode, too."

I meant too give it more time, but the game is so crap i never got around to giving it a second chance.I love i iBomber series, but they should stick to Tower-Defense games, not this horrible ""offensive"" type. Hope they learn and go back to just upgrade and make the iBomber series bigger and more complex. It has great potential to be expanded on, with more maps and capaigns, more ""towers"" and far more upgrades and such.Don't get this one, it's utterly crap."

,Recommended,218660,30761386,Posted: 26 March,all,kschang77,"iBomber attack is one of those one guy / shoot everything type of game where you're this one tank running around in WW2 shooting gajillion German troops, tanks, turrets, and whatnot. You can aim in all directions, and move in a different direction, as you will need a dual-stick gamepad to play this properly. In addition to the main cannon, you can carry up to four different additional weapons, from rockets to flame thrower, from bunker buster bomb to air support.As you complete missions, depending on your level of success you get mission points, and during each mission you can collect ""gold"" dropped to buy the support stuff (such as ammo for the auxiliary weapons) between missions.The missions are the fast-and-furious shoot-everything type where using the right weapons on the right type of enemy is crucial. While you can get by with shooting everything with your main cannon, using your cannon to swat aside infantry is a waste. Flamer can roast most places but is best on houses and infantry, while cannon and rockets are best on vehicles and structures, and so on.You'll face everything from infantry to grenadiers to panzerfausters to flamers, to armored cars with various armaments, tanks with various armaments, turrets with various armaments...You don't autoheal, so be sure to pick up the first aid packs lying all over the place after you wiped out your enemies.There are five ""intel briefings"" per level (often hiding inside houses and such) that you can search for for extra points. Also destruction level is counted as part of your score. For some missions, you can just drive THROUGH the enemy camp and reach the exit, no fight is needed.  Yet those of you who creave destruction and stay around and shoot at everythingEach mission has a primary and a secondary objective, and some of the missions are timed and that can be annoying, but at least the timer is onscreen.There are 25 levels to wade through, and you can always go for challenge mode if you need more playtime, as well as two difficulty levels. If you need some lamost mindless destruction, iBomber Attack satisfied that yearning."

Specifically, it involves tanks blowing up lots and lots of stuff from a top-down point  of view.This is not a game with revolutionary graphics. It does not have an engaging storyline. There is no music and most sound effects consist of explosions.And yet, it is fun.There's just something addictive about systematically blasting a building to pieces to get at an enemy on the other side. Or blasting anything to pieces really, since almost anything you encounter can be destroyed. You may start out in a pristine rural village with cobblestone streets and majestic fountains. Rest assured, by the time you've finished the level the whole place will be a smoking ruin - hells yeah!The controls are easy to master. You do get the ability to buy various upgrades and weapons for your tank as you complete missions.The game is single-player only, with both a campaign and a survival mode. You're looking at several solid hours worth of mindless entertainment for a reasonable price (I bought the game for one dollar)."
