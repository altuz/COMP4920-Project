76561198095003938,Recommended,218680,32269003,Posted: 8 June,all,DokiDokikoro,"For the first time on the PC... I remember Myself playing the first game in This series (Scribblenauts) for the first time on the Nintendo DS and I truly loved it. I just wrote words on a notepad in the game and they appeared out of nowhere in the game-world itself... and I was like: ""WOW!"" This is one is one of those games that has supported and helped Me improve plus learn the English language as a very young child (I'm not from any English-speaking country)THE STORY-------------It tells of the main character's (Maxwell) parents past, starting a family til They had about 42 children. Every kid is very unique when it comes to personality, ethnicity and appearance. Especially Maxwell's sister (Lily) one day Both of Them play  prank on one old hungry man by giving Him a ""rotten apple"" This man becomes enraged because of this and places a curse upon Maxwell's sister Lily. Each of her every ""body parts"" is about to turn into stone each hour passing by. Maxwell tends to help His sister, but how is that possible? How will he be able to unrelease this curse that is turning His sister into stone?GAMEPLAY------------You start as Maxwell You can add pretty much anything into the game with Your magical notepad. You need to use items that is fitting well to solve the problem of the situation You're trying to finish. For some examples: Help a plant to sprout. My solution: add anything that can water over it. Help the kitty down from the tree. My solution: add small wings on the kitty so it can fly down from the sky. An old man wants to sail across the sea. My solution: get Him a sailing raft. Y'know... Stuff like THAT.Not only can You play as Maxwell but on each level in the game on your map (almost) You can unlock all His 40 siblings and play as Them. And You can also change Your avatar by clicking on Your current avatar and go down to the avatar-menu or whatever the hell it's called...! And then You can customize Your avatar how You want Them to look like. Plus in the game itself You can add clothes acessories or a tail, maybe even wings on Your avatar and do alot of other crazy stuff for fun, solving the people in the game's problems.MY OPINION AND RATING---------------------------I like This game. However I prefer the first game over this one. The one for the DS, y'know? I know. I'm kinda weird for liking the DS-game a little better instead of This one for the PC because This one is improved and much bigger than the original first game. But You know what They say: ""The originals beats the sequels!"" Heh. But still This game has alot of potential and can inspire so much, that you don't even know what more to say about it.My rating however, for this game 's going to be a 6/10 because it can't beat the first game (in My opinion) Scribblenauts for nintendo DS: 8.5/10. (however if You've played the first one, I do think You'll like this one a little more (;) the game has good music and can get You joyful for playing it, but it might get a little repeating and monotonous after a while. At least for Me...!"

76561197993891197,Recommended,218680,15197058,"Posted: 3 April, 2015",all,CtrlAltDestroy,"A charming game that expresses the innocent sense of curiosity and imagination of a young child in a way I have rarely seen.If you're not familiar with the Scribblenauts series, they are platformer sandbox puzzle games where you can summon just about any object from the dictionary (with some reasonable exceptions such as copyrighted things, alcohol, and proper nouns) and expect them to interact in a believable way. If you can think of any food, animal, household item, weapon, mythological creature, or vehicle, chances are you can make it appear. We're talking tens of thousands of possibilities. A few surprises can also be summoned, such as a variety of internet memes and special objects, if you can think of them.You can summon objects, or add adjectives to existing objects, to solve puzzles and make all the townspeople happy. Or, you could just screw around for hours summoning gods and beasts and riding them across the world as your epic mounts, or watching them run loose and terrorize the villagers.The puzzles are all ridiculously easy, but difficulty is obviously not the point. Personally, my favorite way to play this game is to think of the most obnoxiously ridiculous solutions to every puzzle. Most puzzles will have a bluntly obvious solution, but you can make hilarity ensue if you can think of something creative. For instance, a guy wanted something to help carve his ice sculpture. I gave him a toenail clipper. Hansel and Gretel needed something to make a trail with through the forest. I gave them thumbtacks. A buzzard wanted something to eat. I gave it a dead baby. A tracking dog needed something that smelled like Santa so he could search for Santa. I summoned Santa.It's an excellent game packed with great humor and content, and it's miles ahead of the Nintendo DS games it was based on. My only complaint is that it got a bit boring after the first few hours, but I fixed that just by taking some breaks and not playing it all on one sitting. But I never once stopped appreciating how wonderful the game is. Highly recommended for anyone who wants to rediscover their inner child, complete with borderline politically incorrect humor, in a way that very few games can provide.(Achievement hunters: getting 100% is very tedious, as you will need to solve over a hundred riddles to acquire the remaining bonus pieces. Usually you will solve some of them on accident throughout normal gameplay if you try to use creative solutions. However, if you ever get bored, you can just look at a FAQ to fully complete the game effortlessly.)"

The notebook enabled them to create anything they wanted, and the world globe allowed them go to any place they wanted. One day they were out and saw an old man, so went up to him. They gave him a rotten apple, but the old man was a wizard and bespelled Maxwells sister with a curse,  gradually turning her into stone, every day it gets worse.

Equally they will perhaps try to find a not-so-obvious route to solve a problem, which again is a credit to the developers.

Using your own creativity to solve the hundreds and hundreds of puzzles without any limits. Unfortunately once i played a bit i started noticing more and more Scribblenauts isn't as unlimited as it claims to be. Now don't get me wrong Scribblenauts Unlimited is a very fun game and has some nice and creative locations you travel to! It runs really smooth and has almost no loading times at all. But the game is just really limited, often i tried solving puzzles in fun and creative ways and ended up on google asking myself why nothing works, with the dissapointing news you could only choose from a set of solutions the developers already choose. This way the game starts to feel like a chore after a while, just solving the puzzles with the most basic solutions because those are the only ones that work most of the time.Now this wouldn't be that bad if the puzzles would actually be challenging, but since this game is aimed more towards kids the puzzles are often so easy they're just boring. However Scribblenauts has some really nice and fun points aswell, you can costumize your own character and all of the different NPC's. And although the puzzles aren't as free as the game claims them to be, there are still quite a few items in the game to mess around with and you can create literally everything you can think of. The artstyle is unique and fits the game perfectly and the music is really catchy.Yes this game can be fun, especially for kids. And even i enjoyed this game, just not till the end cause it got way to repetitive after a while. Don't buy this and expect to get creative by solving the puzzles, buy this if you like solving basic and easy puzzles, don't mind a bit of repetitivty and enjoy messing around to create fun and original stuff."

,Not Recommended,218680,25403111,"Posted: 7 September, 2016",all,Comrade Grim & Evil ☭,"Scribblenauts Unlimited is not a bad game. It's just not as good as I was hoping it would be. It's put together well, the artstyle is good, the soundtrack is good (I can still hear some of the game's music playing in my head,) and the voice acting (what little of it there is) is good. So where does it fall short, then? A few places actually. Let's start with the big one: the gameplay.The idea is to solve puzzles by conjuring up an object, or by adding an adjective to an existing one. Sounds intriguing, but really you just wind up solving puzzles with the most basic of objects. The whole idea of being able to add adjectives to objects is neat, but it's not really put into play all that much. There are a few instances where you must scare Person X away from Object/Person Y. So you just apply the adjective ""Scary"" to Object/Person Y. Or perhaps something needs wings, so you give it the adjective ""Flying."" Makes sense. But there's only a few puzzles that really make use of adjectives. The large majority of the puzzles can be solved with basic objects, and it just kinda starts to feel as though you're grinding through the game rather than really ""solving"" anything. It just gets rather tedious after a while.Then there's the Steam Workshop. Probably the main reason that the game is called ScribblenautsUnlimited,the way the Workshop works is you can use and in-game Object Editor to create your own objects and submit them to the workshop for the rest of the world to use. Likewise, you can download other people's creations. Now, I personally took one look at the Object Editor and said ""No thanks."" But I'm sure those of you out there who have the blood of Michelangelo or Vincent van Gogh coursing through your veins can imagine and create masterpieces with it. I just didn't feel like taking the time to get used to it.Now as for the Workshop itself. It's kind of...meh. There are some really well made and detailed things in there with their own creative and useful functions...surrounded by Five Nights at Freddy's characters. Don't get me wrong, I don't dislike Five Nights at Freddy's. I just dislike seeing it inevery. Single. Workshop.However, you can play and enjoy the game without even looking at the Workshop, so I won't base my judgement of the whole game on it too much.Finally,considering the game's content and how many hours you'll likely get out of the game even if you go to the trouble of 100%ing it, that $20 price tag is WAY too much. To put it in perspective, you can purchase Terraria on Steam right now for $10. That's a game that you can potentially get hundreds of  hours out of. The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth is a similar story: $15 for potentially hundreds of hours. Scribblenauts Unlimited meanwhile is $20 for around 12 hours if you feel so inclined to get all of the achivements. But to be fair, Terraria and The Binding of Isaac are COMPLETELY different than Scribblenauts. Scribblenauts isn't the type of game that you dedicate hundreds of your hours into.

I have seen my daughter play it a lot on her DS so assumed it was a kids game but some of the stuff requires much thought to figure out what these characters need you to create for them. Some things can be funny, some mundane and some dangerous. Yes you can put something out that will kill your people and then you must start the level again. Some are inevitable and restarting does not cause you to lose progress.The workshop also has lots of additional content you can download. To do so you must do it from in game. If you go and just subscribe through steam about 95 percent will NOT show up. To do so go to the object editor (the glue and scissors) and then subscribe from there.Its great when you need a break from the FPS, RPG or Dinos! I had so many hours in ARK that when my husband asked me a question while I was groggy I responded I will just bring my T-Rex!

""Write anything; Solve Everything,"" is the mantra across all the Scribblenaut games and this one has to be the best example of them all. The base game itself comes with an extensive dictionary from the mundane to the supernatural, or both with the added use of adjectives. You can sprawn vampiric doughnuts to feed cops who are then fed in turn or gigantic babies or one of my favourites, Classy T-Rex. It is an old idea but somehow still a unique one, and it never gets boring.Unlike previous games which is limited by profanity, drugs, and copyright restrictions, this game really does live its Limitless name by using the object creator and Steam workshop. Do you want your favourite video game character killing the zombies for you? Pretty sure someone already had the same idea. Just find it and download. Do you want some cool as weapon from real life but somehow was not quite in the game? Why don't you make it yourself? Do you want to reeanact your favourite porn scene? I think you may be able to find a few private parts lying about.(Note to parents: you might want to monitor what your children are using in the game because some things on the Steam workshop are really, truly, yours sincerely, inappropriate)The game itself has you exploring the myriad of possibilies by presenting you senarios in which you need to solve other people's problems. You can use anything you want so long as it does solve the inital problem, even if it does kill everyone at the end. Finding the craziest solution is often the game's secondary goal and though those ideas are not necessarily acknowledged with extra points, the kudos you can get from sharing those antics and the possibilities of schadenfreude are not to be missed. Just read the funny reviews of the game. The scenarios are presented in a themed setting, such as a snowly mountain or a desert town. Everything is on a 2D platformer and you naviagate around it as you would in a Sonic or Super Mario game. That being said, why would you walk around when you can sprawn rocket boots?All in all this is an ambitious, nutty game best played with a good heart and a sick mind. Go forth, chlild, and sprawn the abomination you have only formed in your mind. You will not regret it."

This game company has made a few games that can really inspire creativity, such as Drawn To Life and Scribblenauts, though of course inspire creativity  in different ways.Scribblenauts is a game that encourages you to come up with ways to solve moderatly easy puzzles, where there is no one solution. Because there is no one solution, it has high replay value, with you figuring out what else works, and different ways to do the same thing. At first you might start out summoning a sponge to clean a wall, later you will be using aardvarks for everything.This game has changed a lot since it's start on the Nintendo DS, and you can even MAKE new things with parts of things from the game, and even script their behaviour! Or if you are no good at making things, you can download some from the Steam Workshop!There are very few flaws in this game, as no game is perfect. One flaw I find is not really a flaw, but can be seen as one, you have way too much freedom in this game. Limits really work well in certain games, and with games with too much freedom you can get bored, or you see no challenge. If you get bored, there are heaps of achievements to get and there are little challenges in-game for you to solve. But if you have done everything, you can always clear the game data and start anew, and maybe even have a challenge of your own, like, for example, only using aardvarks, which is something I find myself doing a lot.This game doesn't just stop at the limitless freedom, it also has a very heartwarming story, that premotes kindness. Which is a very nice touch on top of the rest of the game. These types of games are very hard to come across, they are very different from most games, and because they are different and very special, they are games that you must have, even if you are a gamer who plays zombie games, or plays a lot of indie games (a lot of the time they overlap) you must have this, as it is not just another generic game, it is Scribblenauts Unlimited."

As Maxwell, save your sister Lily from a curse by creating happiness around the world with the use of your magical notepad that can create anything you can write.Pros: The game has an astonishing amount of potential content. Almost any word and adjective you can think of, you can create by typing it. There is a lot of different method to resolve any situation, and the fun comes in finding new and unexpected ways to do so. You will find yourself attempting different solutions again and again even after you already succeeded just to see if you can find an easter egg or game secret. Usable created objects also add game elements to work with, and combining people or objects with one or more adjectives increases the possibilities tenfold.Cons: The game is short, you can breeze through it, getting the Starites you need to win the game within a few hours. Many of the puzzles are easy, half of which can usually be resolved with the same few objects. There are multiple passageways to move around a level, but they are often useless as it won't take time for you to always make sure you have a jet-pack or pair of wings to move around. Unless you want to explore the possibilities, you won't find much replayability as resolving a puzzle in different ways still ends up with the exact same result.Verdict: ★★★★☆ - Next on your list!If you're looking for an exciting story, grand adventure or mind-bending puzzles, turn away. But if you're looking for an entertaining time trying to push the limit of the game, and exploring just how far you can go, it's a great one. The Steam Workshop makes it easier than ever to add dozens, if not hundreds of new objects and options, assuming you don't use the object creator to add your own. Furthermore, the game is great for all ages, maybe even more so for younger gamers. Of course, if you didn't like previous Scribblenauts games, you're unlikely to enjoy this one. But if you did,Scribblenauts Unlimitedwill go where previous ones never went before!—————————————————————————This was just my opinion.If you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up, and feel free to check out more of my (purely opinionated)reviews."

I didn't like the DS ones but this one takes the DELICOUS MASSIVE CAKE! But let's talk detail.This game is literally a dictionary stuffed inside cartoon graphics and zapped with story, and I'm okay with that. The story isn't half bad, the level design is fabulous and the graphics is eye candy. There are afew flaws, some times words entered aren't adapted and it won't help you spell your workshop creations (I happen to have made afew) so it can be a little tedious when trying to make somthing specific. Don't make somthing specific! Go nuts! I come back to it even with the story complete just to make some crazy stuff.

,Not Recommended,218680,30521350,Posted: 15 March,all,Cabby,"This series used to be good, and it still is in a way.  But after the adjective system was added, the challenge, and the value of most of the game, was lost.  What used to be a game that tested your ability in word association has now turned into a game about making up nonsensical items.  The ways you can solve puzzles now are so easy; you could complete a majority of the game using nothing but sticks.  Here are a few examples:""Make an item that will put out this fire."" CRYING STICK""Prepare a steak for this customer"" COOKING STICK""Make something for this art museum"" BEAUTIFUL MODERN STICK""Give Santa something he likes, but doesn't already have"" MERRY STICK""Scare away the Vampire"" HOLY STICK""Make this date more romantic"" ROMANTIC STI- actually, don't use that one.Point is, the game has been simplified by this mechanic, and it doesn't reward you in any way for being logical or creative.  Kinda sad, because if they did, you would have a clear, straight upgrade of a game from the first Scribblenauts.  The workshop is flooded with poor remakes of copyrighted characters; something that was purposely left out in the original games.  Its a shame I can't recommend this, because the amount of work put into the engine and content would definitely be worth the $20 price tag if the single player wasn't so absurdly easy.  The most enjoyable part of this game is derping around like its a sandbox game.  If that sounds like something you would get a kick out of, by all means buy this.  Just know that the single player ain't worth♥♥♥♥♥♥PS: This game has a sequel with DC Comic characters in it.  Same kind of game play, and the addition of DC characters doesn't do much for the game itself.  About the only thing that it does is add visual assets to the workshop mods.  So... you're not really missing much in that one either :v  I guess go for it if you are a fan of derping and comic book hero's?"

There are a ton more side quests to complete to get all the shards. All the shards in that menu screen can be done on any level.

You can spawn an evil version of yourself that randomly creates things to see how advanced it is, you'll see things like ""noctophilic haystack"" or ""serendipitous pho."" They use lots of playtesters to see what solutions people would come up with so that combined with lots of items fitting into similar categories means that most puzzles have an incredible amount of solutions. Spawn a pregnant man and a midwife and you'll get a thin man and a baby man, for example. I don't know how that helps solve puzzles, but there's a lot of dynamic events that pop up. It's worth a look and you can buy it, get a feel for it and return it within 2 hours if you don't like it. That's more than enough time to see what the game is like and whether you want to keep playing, after the opening cutscene and tutorial, you're essentially thrown into the game and have all your abilities. The only downside is the Steam Workshop, which is really cool. Lots of... interesting things there but the only way I've found it to work is that you have to subscribe to things from the game itself, that's the only way it would load what you want. I would've also liked to be able to use downloaded models for the character selector but I suppose the detailed character creator is a more configurable tool. Still, it's nigh impossible to pick Jango Fett or Samus as your character unless you know what you're doing."

Most of the problems the game presents you with can be solved in painfully obvious ways.  Do you need to put out a fire? Type fireman.  Is someone  hungry?  Give them food.  Because of this most of the fun in the game will be through either self imposed challenges such as not allowing yourself to solve things in a obvious way or by trying to solve everything in a silly or ironic way.  I myself tried to complete as much of the game as possible using the noun ""baby"" with different adverbs attached to it (this worked surprisingly well).

While it did not have the option to customize objects or use adjectives, most levels were both fun and challenging, forcing you to push your creativity's limits in order to reach the starite. Scribblenauts Unlimited allows much more depth with creating items, but the levels/puzzles do not reach beyond simply creating a category of object when prompted. There are no action levels in Scribblenauts Unlimited and as a result none of the levels are really challenging and there is no satisfaction in completing them.

The flexibility afforded by the in-game crafting system is impressively complex. Occasionally, I was taken aback that I couldn't do something I wanted to, because I'd become so accustomed to every random idea I had working out somehow. There are a lot of different areas to explore and while some puzzles are assininely simple, others are ridiculously complex because of the limits on which answers are accepted. That being said, while it may be difficult to completely 100% without online/outside assistance, the vast majority of content is easily unlockable through a disgustingly convoluted number of silly and serious ways.

Although you can now edit your object and creations more than ever before, as well as get new and incredible creations from the steam commuity workshop and upload your own fairly easily, the most glaring flaw is that the game is also easier than ever before because the ""challenges"" are not as intricate and put together as they used to be. In fact most of the shard ""challenges"" are one-word-one-step solutions. So, although I fully recomend this game with its incredible library of possible creations, adjectives, and small challenges, this is also to say that it is not as great as it could be. If you can, i would fully recomend first buying SUPER scribblenauts on a different system (it's not on steam sadly) where you can experience the more developed gameplay. This said, it seems that by making the game easier and more user friendly, they are aiming at a younger audience, so if you wish, buy it for a child to enjoy, they likely won't notice the flaws or problems mentioned above. I hope you like the game as much as i do, even with these problems, i am happy i bought the game.Also, on a side note, for those of you whom wish to try and get all those achievements on your game, this game is pretty nice. While it may take a bit of work past the end of the storyline to get all the achievements, they are all pretty straightforward and accessable, meaning you can very likely 100% the game if you put in the time. I would say it takes about 6-12 hours to do this depending on how familiar and witty you are at quickly and correctlyguessingcreating the wanted items. You'll need 60 starites to ""finish"" the storyline and 107 to get all the achievements.Enjoy!"

You can enjoy the entire world map and the main story without getting any object shards... little word-play puzzles based on how seperate objects interact. And this is what I did. I finished the whole game, unaware that I hadn't done everything I could.Then, when I noticed all those achievements I hadn't gotten, I opened the menu, looked at the ""shards"" and immediately became twice as entertained. That's right: I became twice as entertained once I'd _finished_ the game.A beauty queen is tired of being pretty. Make her a ""lycanthropic beauty queen"" and spawn a full moon, and you get a shard. That's what an object shard is. And it's amazing.I'm plowing through all those now, but suffice to say, this game is creative and fun and it makes me happy. Avoid the temptation to look any of the answers up; The puzzles are fairly simple and you'll get it on one or two tries, and there's nothing more gratifying than figuring out a solution like lycanthropic beauty queen.Buy."

Aside from the main quest there are ""Starite shards"" which take up most of the game and often has the f*cking answer in the question itself. I feel like this is how this game should of been all along and they shouldn't of made multiple entries in this series. This game is fun at the start but gets extremely boring and repetitive quite quickly. I can't help but feel this game is very childish and is marketed towards younger audiences with everything being resolved by common sense.

Scribblenauts, as you may already know, started out as a series of Nintendo DS games, LikeScribblenautsandSuper Scribblenauts.Now, Don't look away from this game. This game, is, inMYopinion, is the best game in the entire series. Now, lets start with the plot. One time, long ago, there were two young adventurers, Grandma Julie, and Grandpa Edgar. Now, these two often challenged eachother as they explored all over the world. But, it always seemed Julie beat Edgar to the treasure. One day, Julie, Who once again, Beats Edgar to a lost pyramid, Found an engagement ring!Awww...The two retired to start a family. And wanna guess how many kids they had?FORTY FREAKING TWO.Anyways. They had two special  children, named Maxwell and Lily. They gave them Two amazing gifts. One of them was a magic globe, that allowed them to go anywhere they pleased. The second, was the greatest notebook ever found-- It was able to create anything you wrote into it. ""Like a flying rainbow laser-eyed dolphin?"" ... Yes .... Anyways, They're parents, (Yeah, Remeber them?) Thought that giving them these gifts will turn them into spoiled brats. So they sent them off, to face the challenges of the outside world. On they way to the city, they ran into an old man, who said he was famished. So Maxwell, ignoring common sense and not using the notebook for good, Gave the old man something to eat, Which was an apple.No. Not any regular apple, A rotten one!The old man spat out the part of the apple he ate, and somehow places a curse on Lily that is turning her to stone! Maxwell creates a red wagon, and hurrys off to Edwin's Farm. Edwin, who is one of maxwell's brothers, is a farmer. Edwin seemed pretty upset with Maxwell and what he did to the peasant. So, in order to remove the curse, Maxwell needs to collect Starites, by making people happy and using the notebook for good.DANG!That was a pretty dang long plot summary. Anyways, onto the next segment of this review.GRAPHICS!This game. Oh my gosh, THIS GAME. Has some of the best graphics I have ever seen! Not only to we get to learn Maxwell's Backstory, But we learn in in HD Graphics! Next up,MUSIC!My gosh, they went all out with the soundtrack on this one. It sounds aboslutely wonderful! Its just a joy to listen to.GAMEPLAY!Now, heres the thing that is just so cool about scribblenauts. You can CREATE anything you write down! And you use this to your advantage to solve puzzles!DOWNSIDE!Well, the real downside is, that it seems that the puzzles have been... A bit..Simplifed...And thats what kind of drags about this game. The puzzles are either really easy, which is about 45% of them, Medium, about the same, 45%, and Hard? About 10%. So, The games difficulty is so out of place, like, sometimes, theres an easy level with ONE single hard puzzle in it. That is the downside to this game. But, Sence it IS a scribblenauts game, You know,YOU KNOWIt has to be good. My rating? 9.3 out of 10. Scribblenauts Unlimited, Is alot better than the ones on DS, but sometimes the difficulty gets in the way. But I still recommend you give it a go."

It's good for the first <10 hours and then it starts to get awfully repetitive and quite boring. It really needed something more to stop it from getting boring. I think that if you have played any Scribblenauts game before,  it's really not worth your money as they are all practically the same. However on the bright side it is rather fun to play around with different props and items and to make traps and experiment with weapons and monsters (try 'cthulu').Overall I'd give it a 6.5/10 because of its repetitive gameplay."

An electric griddle works wonders too, if you make a lot of pancakes at your house. The ingredients you’ll need are:1 ¼ cup milk2 eggs2 tablespoons vegetable oil2 cups all-purpose flour2 tablespoons sugar3 teaspoons baking powder¼ teaspoon saltThe BatterPancakes aren’t complicated, so the batter is everything! For best results, mix that bowl of batter up right before it’s going to hit the griddle.The wet ingredients come together first. Beat the milk, eggs and vegetable oil in a mixing bowl with a wire whisk.The dry ingredients—flour, baking powder, sugar and salt—are then stirred into the wet mixture. Baking powder is what makes the pancakes fluffy, while the sugar helps the exterior caramelize just enough. And a dash of our friend salt enhances the flavor.Gently mix everything together until it’s combined, but still lumpy. It’ll only take about 10-15 seconds to get to that liquidy-lumpy state. If you over-mix the batter, you’re going to be chowing down on a very tough, rubbery pancake because the gluten molecules start having a party. If you under-mix, you might end up with a mouthful of flour.The CookingBrush a non-stick griddle or skillet with vegetable oil, clarified butter or cooking spray before heating. You don’t need too much with a nonstick pan. (You may be tempted to use regular butter, but it tends to burn easily. Save the butter for the breakfast table.)Heat the griddle over medium-high heat. To determine when the griddle is ready for pancake action, run your hand under the faucet and carefully flick just a tiny bit of water onto the surface of the pan. The water droplets will bead up and sizzle when it’s ready.Pour ¼ cup of batter onto the hot griddle and cook 1-2 minutes or until the bubbles on the surface have finished popping and the pancake is dry around the edges.Now it’s time to flip. Using a spatula, gently turn the pancake over and cook on the other side until golden brown.Serve warmFluffy PancakesPrint Recipe(0)    0 View Full RecipeIngredientsStepsHow to Keep Pancakes HotIf you’re cooking for a crowd, turn the oven to 325°F and put your finished pancakes on a baking sheet as they come off the griddle. That way they all stay hot until you are ready to eat.How to Store Leftover Pancakes in the FreezerStack cooled pancakes between a sheet of waxed paper or parchment. Wrap the stack in foil and freeze. To reheat, preheat the oven to 400°F. Unwrap frozen pancakes and remove from waxed paper. Heat pancakes in a single layer on an ungreased cookie sheet for 5 to 7 minutes or until heated through.How to Store Leftover BatterStoring leftover batter is one of those things one could technically do, but should one? Nah, one really shouldn’t.The baking powder loses its oomph very quickly and the gluten molecules have a field day of chewiness when they are allowed to sit around. Rather than storing leftover batter, we recommend making just the right amount of batter for your breakfast or cooking up the whole batch and storing leftover pancakes in the freezer as directed above.Back To TopTwists on PancakesPancakes are meant to be twisted! There are so many ways you can upgrade your pancakes, from batter mix-ins to mid-griddle additions to final toppings.Batter mix-ins might include pureed pumpkin with pumpkin pie spice, lemon zest and ricotta cheese or even mashed bananas. Our Gingerbread Pancakes are perfect for the holidays. Buttermilk is a common substitute for milk in pancakes too, as the acidity provides extra volume, browning and flavor. Adding additional (or different) wet ingredients may mean you need to adjust your dry ingredients accordingly, so unless you’re simply shaking a bit of cinnamon into your batter, you’ll want to follow a recipe to make sure your flavored pancakes turn out perfectly.Mid-griddle additions would include those tasty bits that you’ll want to place on your hot cakes before you flip them—things like whole berries, chocolate chips, crunchy granola or little pieces of bacon. Adding these types of things to the individual pancakes rather than the batter helps them stay evenly distributed and keeps them from burning. You can use the same Fluffy Pancake recipe outlined above and easily personalize it with whatever you like without changing the batter.Topping options are pretty much unlimited when it comes to pancakes, and also don’t require any new recipe. Obviously butter and maple syrup are classic pancake pairings for a reason—there is no substitute for a hefty drizzle of real maple syrup. But it’s also wonderful to think outside the syrup container and try topping your pancakes with jam, caramel, nuts, fruit, whipped cream, sprinkles and more!8 Easy Twists on PancakesGingerbread PancakesGingerbread PancakesBlueberry Sour Cream PancakesBl"

You can create almost anything you can think of Cthulu, a big Cthulu, a Scary Cthulu, a Purple Cthulu, oh right, I almost forgot! You can also create Cthulu. Jokes aside there is a large variety of things to make, Obviously the game is E10+ so that means nothing inappropriate (Sadly) However you can create weapons, or guns. The game has a pretty forgettable plot line, your sister is turning into stone and you have to get like 70 Starites, or something like that... Not too great but its acceptable.If you are looking for an easy 100% this game is perfect for you, this game took me only 8 hours to 100% (acheivements and all) The game itself is a piece of cake to get through, not very hard, Scribblenauts is a very casual game, which isn't bad. This game is actually very enjoyable, and will leave you wanting more even after a 100% completion!But then something more came... Scribblenauts Unmasked... I was unimpressed by this one as it limited you a lot more than Unlimited, the joy of Unlimited came in the fact that you could do anything however much you wanted, not in Unmasked, if you keep using the same thing you'll start getting punished.Pros: Easy 100%, Pretty chill game you can't really get stressed playing it, Creative, entertaining, Steam Workshop (I like the Wii U take on mods a little better, they have a whole new world added for mods which you could experiment with.), Achievements (Unlike the Wii U Version), Very fun, A WHOLE LOT better than Unmasked (If you don't get it yet, I really don't like Unmasked.), Fun for all ages!Cons: Short, Some worlds just suck in my opinion (I hated the storybook one, and many of the desert ones) you'll forget about many of them, The object shards are fun sometimes but can be boring spawning stuff in for like 2 hours which is required for a 100%, Nothing to do after you beat the main story and 100% in Unmasked you can do little events that continue.Geet Unlimited first, I liked it better than Unmasked, if they make another Scribblenauts game, I should have the mechanics of Unlimited with ideas from Unmasked. Unlimited gets a 8/10 very fun, yet very short."

You were tasked with solving a simple puzzle – get a starite (the game’s star-shaped macguffin), and to do so you could conjure up just about any item you could think of, from the commonplace like cars and ladders, to more outside-the-box things like arsonists and marimbas.  I was always surprised such an excellent game was made by 5th Cell, a game company that was, up to that point, a veritable mediocrity factory.  Was 5th Cell secretly a team of amazing game designers?Scribblenauts Unlimited answers this question with a resounding “No.”Unlimited introduces some new features that should make this game a hit – like an item editor that allows you to create your own stuff.  And, as much as I appreciate a game that allows me to make a bazooka that shoots newborn infants, the new mission-style of the game itself is what ruins it.  Doing a simple task like “get a starite” was rewarding because the solution was open to your imagination.  There was any number of solutions you could use and solving a level made you feel smart and accomplished.  When someone gives you a mission in Unlimited by saying “Boy, I’m hungry.” I don’t care if you say pizza, artichokes, or quinoa, thinking of a kind of food will never feel like an accomplishment.  Also, people who give their missions out to you exist in such a cramped space, sometimes you accidentally solve other peoples’ missions without intending to."

Imagine that you can write down anything - ANYTHING - in your notepad and it appears as an (animated) object. That's... that's just awesome, don't you agree ? All you need is a bit of imagination and you create the wildest things.Still, I was a bit sceptic when I purchased and played Scribblenauts Unlimited because: 1) I thought it would be a simple port, and 2) it wouldn't be any fun for me now (if it wasn't already back then, right ?). I'm so glad I was wrong - once again.Scribblenauts is an amazing port, with beautiful art that looks extremely detailed in 2560x1440. The overview map is the one thing that looks kinda low res. Other than that; great stuff. And there are so many (parts of) stars to collect that you'll never run out of things to do (ok, maybe not, but still...). This game has character !Another thing that took some time to get used to, though, was the fact that you have to switch between mouse and keyboard frequently.

,Recommended,218680,10272655,"Posted: 29 May, 2014",all,Hausu,"Where do I even begin with this game. First off ive been playing this game for about 7 years now and every playthrough ive had of it was exellent. There is alot of variety when it comes to builds. There is the obvious Light/Dark or Grey option for the game but there is also Force user builds, Ranged builds, Pure combat focused guardian, etc. I find the combat to be enjoyable (In my opinion) since its tactical and you can really plan attacks and things of that sort. Take DA:0 for example. Its pretty much the same system. You can start with 3 beginning classes: Guardian (Combat focused), Sentinel (Better skill progression), and Consular (Force powers). You then later in the game get different set of prestige classes depending on your allignment. Now, lets get to the writing of the game. This game has one of the best stories I have ever seen. You'll see once you play it for yourself. The reason I prefer this game slightly over the first is just because I prefer the darker, philosophical, grey aspects of the atmosphere and story a bit better (Kotor 1 is also one of my favorite games). Anyways, this game presents the idea that Dark is not necessarily evil and Light isnt nessesary good and you really get to see the Flaws of both sides. For example, you play as the Jedi Exile, who was exiled from the Jedi order for rusing to war to protect innocents. The Jedi were lazy and waited to ""evaluate the threat"". The dialouge and voice acting in this game is absolutely fantastic (Especially Kreia). For this game, you dont even need to be a fan of Star Wars. A non Star Wars fan would look at this game and just play an RPG. However a Star Wars fan would look at this and play an amazing Star Wars RPG. The reason for this is because the game is set in an era wayyy before the Movies. One flaw however, would be the cut content presented this game. Obsidian (The developers) were rushed to release this game by lucasarts, resulting in them needing to cut out content for the game. Luckily, a group of community modders managed to get into the games files and restore alot of the content that was cut. You can find the mod on the steam workshop. Anyways, hurry up and buy the game! You wont be dissapointed."

The puzzles are pretty easy, as they usually ask for something from a broad category to solve the tasks; there are one or two situations where the answer is ridiculously specific, but these are far and few between. Additionally, you can just sit in an area and spawn whatever you want to mess around, or you can use the game's object editor to create new objects and upload them to the Steam Workshop, or download other people's creations. If you're someone who just wants to beat a game, you can do it in an evening or two, but people who like sandboxes or games that give you the ability to just goof off and use your imagination will probably get the most out of this game."

No.This game is simply not challenging enough for an adult to play. The starite sequences are easy to complete, and the shard hints are easy to figure out. When it comes down to it, the most gameplay you'll be engaging in is pressing ""Enter"" and typing. True, you can do some goofy things like making people blind and making animals fly, turn colors, or force school children to eat cats, but when that is said and done, the game doesn't get much more entertaining.The achievements are rather easy to unlock aswell. All of the shards are available to unlock without any prerequisites, and the starites are achieved through normal gameplay. The most backtrackingI had to do was resetting a level maybe three times. It's nearly impossible to fail at this game unless you accidentally get Maxwell killed. There are no timed levels and the game eventually tells you what to spawn if you take too long to complete a task during a starite mission.My five year old loved this game. He enjoyed the themed levels, the ability to spawn almost anything, and how he could interact with almost all of the objects. We would often play together and the game motivated him to learn how to spell.  He would ask me how to spell certain words and I believe the game made learning a little bit more enjoyable for him.

As much as I enjoy it. I have to admit I barely recommend it. Most tasks are so easily completed I feel like im just going through the motions. :/ It has some funny things but most humor is aimed towards small children. I suppose thats who the game was designed for so I really can't knock it too much from my point of vieust wish it had a more varied experience. Overall I'd say its barely above average. But if you need a relaxing break, something to jus kick back and chip away at I'd say this isn't a bad one.Gameplay: 7/10Graphics: 7/10Sound: 7/10Concept: 9/10Replay: 7/10"

You run around helping people for starites(I won't say why because spoilers!!). You really have to be creative with this game. This can get repetitive though. The graphics are great. The HD added with the color is beautiful and since it is 2D it should be easy for all computers. As for content there's lots to do. Even when your done the game you still have tons to do as anything you right will appear. How they put all this in? No clue! When you think you have seen it all there's more. It has something called object editor  . With this you can make anything you want (It is not to complicated either), you can then post your creation on steam workshop. With Steam Workshop you can see and use other peoples creations, this adds a new level to the game. Overall its a fun game for a casual gamer but if you were expecting it to be all sirius and precis, you came to the wrong place. Overall I give the game 8.3/10"

,Recommended,218680,26664953,"Posted: 17 November, 2016",all,fadilizer,"1. Change Your PositionThat's right. Changing your sitting position to a squatting position in the toilet will really help make you poop fast. You may not know this but sitting on the pot is not the ideal position forpooping. When you sit on a toilet, your ♥♥♥♥♥♥ will be in a kinked position that will exert pressure on your rectal veins and♥♥♥♥♥♥ which could lead to bowel herniation, hemorrhoids and other illnesses. The best position to poop is to squat. Even when you're on your sitting toilets, you need to adjust your position a bit by elevating your feet a bit to get into a squatting position. You can simply squat on a wastebasket or stool placed right before your toilet when having bowel movement.2. Make Time for Bowel MovementSelect a time to have a bowel movement and stick to it. Regularity will make your bodyunderstand that it's time to have a bowel movement and you will be able to poop fast. You can schedule any time – in the morning after you wake up, after your afternoon meal or several times in a day. Going for a bowel movement at different times daily will confuse your body and make pooping difficult.3. Try Olive OilIf you don't know how to make yourself poop fast, try olive oil. It works amazingly well to relieve constipation by stimulating your digestive system and getting things moving through your colon. Consume a tablespoon of olive oil on an empty stomach in the morning – you can also mix it with a bit of lemon juice for better effects.4. Drink Coffee and Warm BeveragesMany runners believe that there is nothing better than a cup of coffee in the morning to get your bowel moving. You can try it as well because the caffeine helps stimulate a bowel movement. A cup of tea or warm water may also help widen the blood vessels in your digestive system to make it easier for you to poop.5. Consume MolassesBlackstrap molasses are quite beneficial for anyone suffering from chronic constipation, because have high levels of minerals, vitamins and magnesium that help you poop fast. Simply consuming a teaspoon of blackstrap molasses will help improve your digestion and prevent constipation. If you don't like the taste of blackstrap molasses, you can add a teaspoon of molasses to a cup of warm water and drink like tea. Please note that the tea may not prove that effective though.6. Let Prunes HelpOne of the very best cures for difficult pooping is prunes. You can also use prune juice for equal effects. The fruit has natural laxative effects on your body mainly because it's rich in fiber and contains sorbitol as well. Sorbitol softens your stools for it has natural but hard to digest carbohydrate, which draw lots of water when passing by your intestines and add bulk to your stool. Drink a glass of prune juice (8oz.) in the morning and one at night to help you poop fast. Avoid drinking too much or it may cause gas.7. Eat YogurtHealthy gut flora will ensure that you poop fast in the morning. It has become even more important today to maintain gut flora because you just cannot avoid processed sugars and foods altogether. Eating yogurt is one outstanding way to increase the number of good bacteria in your gut that promote healthy bowel movements. Simply eat a cup of yogurt with breakfast and try to eat it with snacks throughout the day for better effects.8. Exercise and MoveEven if you try other remedies and spend your day sitting in front of your computer, you won't get any good results. You need to exercise and move your body to ensure the stuff you eat moves through your intestines with ease. It is, therefore, important to make lifestyle changes to have a healthy digestive system. Exercising regularly will help you solve the question, ""how to make yourself poop fast."" But be careful and keep in mind that it is not a good idea to exercise within an hour of eating big meals.9. Add Fiber-Rich Foods into DietWhen you're a victim of chronic constipation or you often find it difficult to poop, you need a long-term solution, which could be as simple as adding more fiber-rich foods to your diet. You usually need 25 g-30g of fiber every day to keep constipation at bay, and you can get enough fiber by consuming veggies, fruits, nuts, seeds and whole grains. Also, add bran, berries, plums, apples, broccoli, Brussels sprouts and cabbage to your diet.10. Try AcupressureThe space between your♥♥♥♥♥♥and your genitals is called the perineum in pressure therapy. Massaging that point will help relax your muscles and make it easier for you to poop."

The entire story part of the game revolves around solving people's problems like hungry cannibals (feed them a baby), hungry gamers (feed them a pizza with a baby on top of it), discovering space (send a baby up there), calming down a bloodthristy volcano (sacrifice a baby) or making an alien couple happy (by giving them a baby with superpowers). The fun comes from the fact that everything is a sandbox, and every puzzle can be solved in many different ways. A simple example would be ""disposing"" of a foe: you can either kill it, put it to sleep, put it in a cage, or just use the ""set adjective"" mode to petrify it, and much more.Really recommended for people with a bit of immagination and a crush for doing stuff with babies."

Essentially, you play as a kid with the ability to summon almost any non-vulgar, non-copyrighted thing you need into the game. Want a whale? Done. Chocolate bar? Got it. Guns? Done. Unicorn? Ofcourse. You can even add adjectives which will usually modify what you're summoning, so ""big unicorn"" would get you a larger one.Long story short, you're trying to get collectibles in each area, and getting them involves needing to do certain stuff. Summon whatever you like to get it done. It's surprisingly entertaining and fun. I'm very glad I played through this game.

Add water, oil, and salt. Mix.- Add 1 cup flour to the bowl. Use a fork to mix the flour with the eggs, water, oil, and salt. Repeat with the rest of the flour. Mix until a smooth dough is formed.- Clear and clean off a large work surface and dust it with flour. This is where you are going to roll out your dough.- Take the dough out of the mixing bowl, shape it into a ball, and place it on your work surface. Knead for at least 10 minutes or until it becomes elastic.- Dust a rolling pin with flour to prevent the dough from sticking. Roll out the dough until it is about 1/8 inch (1/3 cm) thick, or about the thickness of 2 stacked quarters.- With a cookie cutter or upside-down water glass, cut out circles in the dough (will make about 15-20 dough circles).- Ball up the unused dough and either roll it out and make a couple more raviolis, or wrap it and put in the freezer for another time. Dough can keep for weeks when frozen. Just make sure to wrap well so that it doesn’t suffer from freezer burn or absorb freezer odor.Fill the Ravioli shells.- Take the ravioli filling out of the refrigerator and place a tablespoon of it in middle of a dough.- Fill a small bowl with water, dip your fingers in, and moisten around the outer edge of the dough circle.- Fold the dough in half over the filling, making a half-moon shape. Be sure all the filling stays inside. Pinch the edges together and then seal the edges of the ravioli with a fork. Make sure to press firmly and go all the way around. This will add a “homemade” touch as well.- Repeat this process for all your dough circles.- Dust the finished ravioli with flour to keep them from sticking together.Form the Shells and Fill Using a Ravioli maker.- Roll the dough into two sheets- Place one sheet on the ravioli maker, and form the filling cups.- Fill with the ravioli mixture.- Lay the second sheet of dough on top, and roll it out. This will seal in the filling.- Remove and separate the finished raviolis.Cook the Ravioli.- Fill a large pot with water and bring to a boil.- Place the ravioli in boiling water for 5-6 minutes, or until they float. You can also test for doneness by nibbling on the edges to test.- If you don't want to make all the ravioli at one time, you can freeze the rest- Take ravioli out of boiling water with large slotted spoon and place on warmed platesServe it up.Top with your favorite sauce, grate some fresh cheese over it, and enjoy!"

The amount of words in the dictionary is really impressive, and you can solve puzzles pretty much any ridiculous way you want. But if you're looking for a good brain workout, look elsewhere. This is by no means a brain-teaser.I'm really confused as to what audience this game was intended for. It's so simplistic that a 6 year old could easily figure out all the puzzles, but there are words and references that only an adult would get. If it was meant to be played by parents and children together (which would make sense), it's certainly not marketed that way.The unfortunate truth is that this game gets boring incredibly fast. You can solve puzzles in very creative ways, but there is no incentive to try because the game rewards you exactly the same way no matter what you do. You could create a giant burning zombie made of bacon to melt an iceberg in your way, but using a flamethrower will net you exactly the same result, so eventually the appeal of using your imagination wears off and you'll settle for the easy solution just to push through faster. Even playing with friends or being inebriated (which usually make anything awesome) only extends the fun for so long.If you're still curious and want to try it, at least wait for a sale, because $19.99 is just way too much of an asking price."

If someone wants a picture, you give them a camera; if someone is hungry, you give them food.  However, you could be creative.  If someone is hungry, you could always give them something amusing that might satisfy them.  The thing is, this gets old very quickly.  If you have a friend to play it with, you could laugh at it, but it loses its appeal if you're playing alone.  It just wasn't enjoyable enough for me to recommend."

There's no penalty for using the same words over and over and the game doesn't really reward cleverness, you can solve pretty much everything with adjectives or the same obvious solutions. A game with limitless potential for creativity isn't worth much when it offers no incentive to actually be creative beyond self-amusement. The controls are also pretty bad, you'll find yourself repeatedly accidentally opening menus and pausing the game when you try to attack things, although this game is very light on reflexive action as it is..

It also falls over when you consider that many of the puzzles in the game can be solved in the same few ways. Work out one or two of the solutions that just repeatedly work and you can blast through the game extremely quickly. This leaves mopping up the collections to become a rather tedious task.The novelty wears off on Scribblenauts pretty quickly. It's fun at first, but that soon wears off, leaving you with an adorable game that's far too easy. I think this might be challenging for a small child. If you have a small child, give it to them to play, perhaps play it with them. Or just play it while you're too drunk to think clearly. This would be an amazing game to play while drunk."

It is such a load of closed minded, sexist, anti-scientific, moralising rubbish.Many of the restrictions are merely reflections of the rating system in place for games so the devs aren't really to blame but when you put it in this context they become so incredibly infuriating. So for example, it is perfectly fine to spawn a flame-thrower and burning everyone alive. One the other hand woe betide you if you try to spawn anything relating to sex, drugs or alcohol because none of those words are in Scribbenauts' vocabulary. I get that this is a children's game but then why can we spawn flame throwers? Why is violence so often featured in the puzzles, often unavoidably? Why does one level feature torture? Why can we spawn iron-maidens if we feel like it? It is garbage. Moralising garbage that shoves a twisted morality down the player's throat where torture and violence are a-okay and sex and alcohol are the works of the devil.Other things are clearly in place just to reduce controversy so you can spawn old religious figures that not many people take seriously any more like Thor and Zeus but not Jesus, and Mohammed is right out. Mind you so are most of the historical figures I've wanted to spawn so far. Someone was clearly in the grip of internalised capitalist oppression so I tried to spawn Marx to talk some sense into them, I didn't seriously expect this to work but I did expect to be able to spawn Marx but no. I gave up and spawned a Lemon when that was the suggestion when I tried Lenin.On another occasion a scientist wanted someone to talk to so I tried to spawn Aristotle, this worked but it seems the game doesn't consider Aristotle to be a scientist so the scientist refused to talk to him. Einstein of course worked but it felt like such a hollow victory to resort to the bloody obvious. And the game forces you to resort to the bloody obvious so often. Thinking outside the box is so often met with no reaction at all from the game. Sometimes the box you're meant to be thinking inside is bloody stupidly defined as well. One of the hints was to solve the problem of needing to melt a block of ice to thaw out a prehistoric man ""with science"". I tried heating the ice in various ways. The ice melted but level was failed. I tried ordering the ice to melt with adjectives. The ice melted but level was failed. I tried spawning salt and using that on the ice. The ice melted but level was failed. Eventually I resorted to Google. It seems ""with science"" in the Scribblenauts world means ""don't try to solve this yourself, spawn a scientist to do it for you"". Good god, such a stupid anti-scientific attitude to science.Finally there is Lilly, poor, poor Lilly. First off she is a Ms. Male by which I mean she is a female version of Maxwell with no other distinguishing personality or features except for being pink. Then she gets damseled in the opening cut-scene. Then you find that each level you can unlock one more of her siblings as a new playable character if you don't want to play as Maxwell, how many of these are sisters? None. Seemingly the other god knows how many playable characters are brothers. *sigh* Maybe Lilly becomes playable after the end of the story missions and she is released from her predicament but if so it is too little and far too late.No. Enough. There is joy in the heart of this game but after you're over the initial rush of apparent power the limitations and all the rubbish that come with it suck all the joy of it. I dare say some might say that as a grown man I shouldn't be surprised that I can't enjoy this since I'm hardly the target audience but honestly given the amount of twisted crap that is wrapped up with this game there is no way I'd let a child play it."

Additionally some of the answers are references to pop culture such as LOTR, which if you dont know about your not going to be able to solve. After finishing the game you find out about this list of 200 items you have to summon off a list thats annoying to access requiring multliple clicks threw menus to reach.The game also lacked much of a plot, your sister is frozen and you have to unfreeze her thats pretty much it.

The game concept is engrossing enough; type any word or phrase and it will appear in-game. Y'all already know I was rolling with my posse of George Washington and Napoleon on the reg, sporting a tuxedo and wielding a flamethrower atop my giant flying jaguar. The open nature also makes the options to resolve ""quests"" interesting (we'll get to that later). I was a vengeful God, and if a person needed, say a bag of money, I would make them blind in return. If they wanted a child, it would be a gargantuan, dying, amphibious baby. And for a while the gimmick was entertaining. However, the gimmick gets old fast. Because that's all the game is; an interesting game concept and gimmick that is stretched into a full-length video game.The game quests are extremely shallow and repetitive. An NPC says ""I need something that can do this/is like this/is this, and you oblige them. This process takes an average of 7 seconds to complete, and is the core of game progression. Like I said, this provides plenty of opportunity for humorous moments. But the game counts on you to make those moments happen. And there's really no incentive to do so; because the game is so repetitive, you want to just blow through it and be done with the quests. As the game progresses I became more and more utilitarian with my answers. I just didn't have the heart to try and make humor out of what felt like work. ""I need a friend"" - give them a dog. ""I want to write"" - give them a pencil. THe process became so monotonous and boring it was unbearable.This is a game that brings the player an interesting but temporarily engaging concept and absolutely drab quests and asks the player to bring the fun. Whereas ""make your own fun games"" like Just Cause and GTA create diversity in how you can create that fun, Scribblenauts is dull and taxing throughout. Just knowing that this game exists is about as much fun as playing it. Don't buy it, not even on sale."

You don't even have to move, really. There are no challenges. There are only fill-in-the-blank scenarios.That's it.Even Kirby games have challenge and variety.For a game whose central theme is goodwill and charity, I'm wondering why I'm asked to arm and harm others, and break criminals out of prison. With a name like Bruiser, I'm pretty sure his incarceration was not unjust.My initial excitement by a VA appearance from Jennifer Hale was immediately snuffed when I realized she would spend the entire game in the barn while her 41 brothers explored the world and had incredible adventures. By the time I freed her from the barn, I was sick of the game and couldn't continue.As a Scribblenauts fan, this game was incredibly disappointing. The free iPhone version is leagues better, and it doesn't even have adjective mechanics."

As Max, your goal is to obtain the Starite by any means necessary. Fortunately, you are armed with a magic notebook; when Max writes nouns the game understands in the notebook, whatever he's written is summoned into reality. With Scribblenauts Unlimited he gains the ability to use adjectives, as well, even adding them to existing objects.In the first Scribblenauts game, getting the Starite usually (but not always) required solving a physics puzzle. In Scribblenauts Unlimited, though, you generally just end up walking up to an NPC, being told the NPC wants something, and then writing down examples of whatever is requested.For instance, an NPC might be described as a ""Hungry Vegetarian."" Write down ""apple"" ""pancake"" ""carrot"" get Starite. (That was off the top of my head, but it might actually be in the game. That's the level of sophistication.) It's less a video game and more a vocabulary test. Oh, and since a LOT of puzzles require knowledge of English-language culture, don't even expect to be able to use it to help learn the language.It doesn't help that in the first game Max would often find himself in danger and need to find a way to protect himself. Here, the first thing you do in each level is click on Max and add adjectives like ""Immortal Flying Fireproof"" to yourself and then roam with impunity.Basically ... if the first Scribblenauts was easy, Scribblenauts Ultimate barely qualifies as an activity book. An expensive, overproduced activity book."

,Not Recommended,218680,13683137,"Posted: 29 December, 2014",all,✜ Clawnoob ✜,"[Warning: There may be spoilers ahead. Read at your own risk.]This game really disappointed me. I had seen adds for it before and it seemed very cool, but it was not all it was cracked up to be. First off, the avatar creator REALLY disappointed me. It was too difficult to work with and never really ended in my favor. I got a few avatars to work good, but they didn't express my full creativity because the current avatar creator was very difficult to work with, especially when working with several entities. Second, I feel the game really starts off too easy. It was just a create one of MANY things to solve very simple tasks. The difficulty should really pick up earlier since Scribblenauts was a puzzle game (and even a free-play game). The game seems as if it was designed for a mere child to play. Third, the side-quests. Though they added more spice and variety to the game, it just seems to be a lot of annoying running around or too vague to even finish. This problem was fixed in Unmasked, but they should've done something about it in Unlimited. The game also doesn't seem to have as many levels as it did in the DS games. Though, I will finish this game and play it more (since I bought it) I do not recommend it to others.I rate 3.4/10 for the game.And 4/10 for the avatar creator."

76561198005971335,Recommended,218680,19071847,"Posted: 14 November, 2015",all,Axelrad,"A fantastically fun puzzle game. The solutions are unusually easy for the genre, but the unique mechanics give you an incredible range of creative options to work with, encouraging you to think outside the box and go crazy with all sorts of alternate solutions. Thanks to the low difficulty, this allows the game to function equally well for kids who are learning to think critically or adults who like being creative.MechanicsWriting. Yep, that simple. You’re presented with a puzzle, you think of what object you need to solve it, you write that word, and poof! you’ve created that object. You can also add adjectives to objects to give them different traits, which is required by certain puzzles. The in-game dictionary is respectably large, with everything from generic items to everyday objects to all sorts of professions to all the major pantheons to a variety of oddly specific animals & plants.There’s a surprisingly complex system of interactions built in between different items. Scarecrows scare crows, devils are instantly killed by holy water, honey badgers kill everything, war can be defeated by a white dove, the large hadron collider can create a black hole, combining a cat & toast destroys the universe . . . the possibilities are endless and often contain hilarious references. You can tell that a ton of effort went into this.However, there are a few hard limits on what you can’t create. Namely, nothing sexual or vulgar. It’s marketed as a family game, after all. Though in typical American fashion, the game will allow you to be surprisingly violent without raising an eyebrow. Scribblenauts Unlimited will let you set packs of children on fire or get people to cannibalize each other or feed babies to raptors or any other manner of creative atrocities, but you can’t dare have exposed nipples. Think of the children!The rules for proper nouns are also somewhat confusing. For the most part, proper nouns are a no-go, but there are a few exceptions for famous people and some other random things. Not many and not very consistent, but they’re there. The lack of consistency can be annoying – only a small handful of world-famous names actually give you anything, yet the entire dev team produces valid entries. They made sure that Cthulhu is in there, so at least they got that much right.The Starite Vision mechanic makes it super easy to find the puzzles in each level, meaning that you’re never left lost and looking around for where to find more shards (which was apparently a problem in the first game).Of course, the PC version of Scribblenauts Unlimited allows modded dictionary words, which people diligently use to add their favorite celebrities or ponies or Pokémon – a treasure trove of items for the dedicated player.The game also possesses a free-roam adventure aspect to it, as you can run around the map and just have fun. There’s a bit of a fighting system in there, so you can shoot or hit other characters . . . or light them on fire or turn them nice or set off a nuke and kill everyone or suck the world into a black hole or whatever you want.  You can spawn pretty much any item and apply whatever adjectives you want to things, meaning that the ability to express yourself as you play is endless.Everyone gets to play the game their own way, and that’s the most beautiful part about it.Level DesignVery elegant for the type of game it is.  The main quest simply requires you to go around completing puzzles until you've collected 60 starites. There’s substantial wiggle room built into the main quest, as you only need to earn just over half of all the possible 106 starites in the game. So while a completionist can explore the entire game and have fun collecting all of them, a younger or lazier player need only explore the puzzles that they can actually figure out. Thus the game remains fun and kid-friendly by letting them learn and express themselves without being punished for getting stuck on specific puzzles.Every stage has two types of challenges present in it: starites and shards. The shards are simple puzzles that usually only require you to create a single item to solve. They reward a shard – several of which combine to form a starite, giving you a slow but steady way to collect starites. The starite puzzles are larger, self-contained little scenarios that consist of several puzzles chained together. They’re more elaborate and have way more attention to detail placed into them.  They take longer and are sometimes more difficult, but completing them gets you a whole starite right away.Each stage will only have 1 or 2 starite puzzles, but a bunch of shard puzzles. This gives a really nice balance to the game, and makes the starite puzzles feel like special treats that break up the normal gameplay of steady shard collection through simple puzzles. You can also earn shards (and achievements) by performing unique & creative actions in the world, which incentivizes players to explore and have fun creating things.NarrativeMaxwell & Lily are a pair of siblings with world-famous explorers for parents. Their parents pass down a magic notebook to them – you can write anything in it and it makes it appear! Maxwell & Lily are sent out into the world to explore, but immediately abuse the power of the notebook to pull a prank on a poor old man. The old man curses Lily and encases her in a slowly-growing tomb of stone, revealing that this curse can only be broken by the power of starites. Since starites are released by happiness, Maxwell has to rush out and use the power of the notebook to make as many people happy as fast as he can, in the hopes that he can save Lily in time.It’s a pretty simple kid’s story with a strong Aesop about using your abilities to make the world a better place. It works really well, especially for the sort of educational game this is. Maxwell learns that playing dirty tricks on other people is bad, and that he should use his talent to bring joy to the world instead.For adult players, the game is absolutely FILLED with jokes. Tons and tons and tons of subtle little jokes and references to all kinds of things, in particular nerdy properties. It’s surprisingly funny. I caught myself laughing out loud all through my playthrough.AestheticsVery pretty. The entire game has this goofy cartoonish look, like everything is made from construction paper and pinned together – the sort of thing a kid would make during playtime. It’s a super solid, cohesive art design. Reinforces the fact that the game is played with your imagination more than anything else. And the levels have a wide variety of styling, with different zones linked together by shared art to create a world that feels “real.”The only voice acting in the game is during the opening and closing cutscenes, but it’s well done. Really injects some feeling into what is otherwise a simple story.  David Franco’s music is great at reinforcing positive emotions. The level themes are relaxing, helping the art to create a soothing atmosphere for a fun puzzle game. The main menu theme is impressively upbeat, creating a joyous mood as soon as you start the game. Then there's the rewarding jingle you get for winning a starite – composed of 110% ""feel good.""Makes you just want to go collect more starites.Overall Rating:  5/5"

,Recommended,218680,6817141,"Posted: 5 May, 2013",all,Celila,"A very cute puzzle game. It can only be played in single-player mode, but it's fun to solve the different puzzles together with a friend and to try to come up with the craziest objects :D Or the best ways to kill off your on-screen characters :pUnfortunately, there were some bugs in the game. Starites I couldn't get, even if I used the objects being described in walkthroughs. I had to reset the levels concerned, and suddenly the same objects worked. No idea where the problem was.And of course the game has to be scripted in a certain way. Sometimes more than one solution works, sometimes only _their_ solution works which can be quite annoying if you don't know what they want from you. Especially because of translation errors!!! More on this now.The German translation is quite bad, many synonyms are not available. For example: The German word for ""ship"" (Schiff) is not part of the dictionary in this game, instead you have to be more specific and try a ""Segelschiff"" (sail boat), just to find out that this doesn't exist either, but a ""Segelschoner"" is proposed in the list ... (a very rare word -_-). This goes on and on ...Another very annoying thing is grammar!! The adjectives in the dictionary are not written without declination but sometimes with female declination, sometimes with male declination ... and the adjective won't be recognized if you don't chose the one in the dictionary (!!!!).Right now I'm playing the game in French. There seem to have been some matching errors between people and their translated names (a person being described as a ""raging socialist sponge"" ?!), but other than that, most things in French seem to work fine. There seem to be more synonyms in the dictionary. And it doesn't matter if you type the feminin or masculine version of an adjective, both work fine!One very annoying matching/translation error in French that makes it impossible to solve the puzzle: You meet two children in front of a tree house. It says in the description that you should put more life into the pond. ""Il faut peupler le lac."" Ehm.. ok, what pond, what lake? There is no water, we are on a tree?! I checked in an English walkthrough and they were talking about help needed to repare their tree house... so the solution to this puzzle is a ""DAD"", a father... well, no idea what the translator was smoking, but maybe I'll stumble across another puzzle where they ask me to repair the tree house and this time i'll need fish -_-""Being a translator myself, errors like these annoy me quite a bit - no matter whether they are in German or in French. It just means that these games have never been played once in the respective languages to do a quality check. There was no proof-reading of the actual product, in this case the game.Errors like these can severely reduce the fun of playing the game. Furthermore, this often leads to the phenomenon that games flop in some countries, even if they are a huge success in their country of origin or in countries where the original language of the game is being widely spoken. And afterwards the developers think that those countries just didn't get the humour, are lacking in some kind of way...@Developers & Publishers: DON'T PAY DUMPING PRICES FOR TRANSLATIONS!! DO QUALITY CHECKS WITH REAL PEOPLE! TAKE THE TIME TO DO ONE OR MORE CORRECTION CIRCLES.Sure that will cost a bit, but guys, if you can sell 100.000 copies more throughout the world because your games are of a higher quality in all languages ... it's worth it! What's the point in doing a bad translation? Just don't translate it at all! You won't risk your reputation!!!"

Granted, the puzzles are pretty easy, it doesn't so much provide a challenge as a puzzle game so much as it brings out your imagination to cleverly solve puzzles in ways that might not seem obvious. My only other gripe is that the game's story is relatively short. Once you collect 60 starites, the main story is complete allowing you to finish any levels you didn't complete.

Pretty good game to share with younger kids, though there are some ""dark"" parts to it that frighten my son a bit (he doesn't like robots shooting guns at us and feeding the cannibal lead to an interesting question or two from him...).  This game really only gives back what you put in.  You can put in the obvious simple answers and it can be boring, or you can try crazy things and have some fun.

If you *have* played a game like this before though, I'm not sure if I would recommend this one.As much as I enjoyed the premise at the beginning, as I progressed, I found the game got stale. I was hoping for a much stronger puzzle-solving element to the game, but unfortunately everything is pretty straight forward, and there are a lot of clues that are force-fed to you.

There is plenty of areas where you can go and there are plenty of NPCs that will require a form of assistance. You may have some trouble with this game but only if you want to think of the most creative or funny solution rather than taking the easy way out (IE, giving the boy scout a giant smelly purple grenade launcher rather than a hunting rifle).If you are creative, this is definitly a game for you. As the game suggests there is an unlimited amount of objects to create, and should your creativity get stunted, you can always check out the Steam Workshop for more things to add, or even create your own."

But at some point, it may get a little repetitive, if you choose the obvious solutions. The fun part is to solve the puzzles is the craziest way as possible.Charming as always, but with more soul...

Cat stuck in a tree? Write, ""ladder,"" and ""fireman"" and watch them appear in game and save the cat.  Soldier in need of a weapon?  How about typing in ""bazooka,"" or ""laser gun,"" or even ""Excalibur"" or ""Thor's Hammer"" if you want.  It's all in the game, and it'll all work towards solving puzzles.  The game really is almost limitless, with the dictionary of recognized words limited mostly by one's imagination, and it makes it a lot of fun just to aimlessly type things in, watch them come to life, and mess around.Scribblenauts is the kind of game that prides itself in creativity in addition to its undeniable charm.

Maxwell also with his Sister Lily with her Magic Globe in which can teleport them anywhere in the world.You can create literally anything and share them on the Workshop.The extent of the creativity is amazing, 'Flying giant rainbow Chicken"" is a favourite of mine in which it literally does summon a giant chicken in rainbow colours that can fly and i can ride anywhere. Another example is 'deadly evil magical apple' in which summons an Apple which magically moves around and attacks people. The creativity is endless and with this creativity you can use this ability to help people with their problems and activities like helping a chef prepare a meal, help a cat get down off a burning tree, repair a broken robot etc. but also with the creativity you do not have to literally do as they expect as you could help a chef cook his meal with dead body parts and toxic waste and it comes out it many ways or help a man get ready for a date and you can give him a dead rose or a gun and she will love it no matter what.This game is a amazing side scroller and is very recommendable."

This verison is great because it not only has adjectives, but also has added starite object shards for you to collect. This is added fun after you finish the main story, which is fairly short. I do miss having the option to create your own little customizable area to spawn things in, but I can look beyond that just because this game allows me to make my own custom avatar for the game. Not to mention all the items/words you can add thanks to the steam community! Word of warning, this game will have you making weird word combonations and possibly cause you to create objects that randomly explode. It is a game too fun for its own good."

The amount of ways that you can play this game is quite impressive, in fact the most fun part of the game is just playing around with the notebook and see what weird things you can create.The downside of this game for me was the difficulty level, which is virtuall non-existent. The game requires you to use your imagination, but not a lot of it. You can create something extravagant to solve a simple problem, or just use the simple obvious solution. Because of the difficulty level, i got bored rather quickly, but for those that would like to just play around and test their nifty minds, this is a great game to do so.7,5/10"

Probably more aimed towards kids but its fun enough for adults to enjoy tooFull version:This game puts in control of Maxwell who has to collect enough starites to stop his sister fro turning to stone. He does this by doing good deeds for people using a magic book that create anything you type in. Theres lots of different themed levels  ,such as underwater or in space to name a couple, full of NPCs that need your help. Most of it is pretty simple but the game lets you be quite creative in how you handle the NPCs requests. You can also pretty much spawn anything you can think of excluding sex related or copyrighted items (yet it still has all kinds of weapons and some requests have a bit of dark humour to them).Good points:- the range of stuff you can spawn is really impressive. Everything from guns to food, helicopters to banks, Napoleon to Cthulu, if you can thinkof something its proabably there. The game also includes Steam Workshop support where even more things are uploaded or you can have a go at creating something yourself.-the game has universal appeal. Simple and colourful enough for kids to enjoy with pop culture and humour that can appeal to older gamers.- the game has a nice colourful charm and the variety of levels is nice as wellBad points:- once the initial novelty of being able to spawn whatever you want wears off it does start to get a little dull. You do pretty much the same thing in everylevel. Running around to NPC's spawning what they need rinse and repeat."

The object editor is a little tricky to use, and a little limited, but to those willing to dive in I'm sure it's enough to please even the hardiest of Scribblenauters.My only issue now is two very major things:1. No Action Stages - It's a damn bust. The first Scribblenauts was half action, jump a ramp, fight some Zombies, slay Cthulhu, grab the Staritie. Second game had even less, now Unlimited is completely reduced to: Solve the Issue. I'm halfway through the game and I am utterly astonished I haven't needed to make any God Gear or Weapons to use. PAH!2. No Level Editor - I could dismiss problem #1 if problem #2 didn't exist. This one really busts my chops. The potential of level editing and sharing is ENORMOUS especially with the Steam Workshop having people share items. What good is making epic items and sharing them if you beat the game? NOTHING! THEY ARE WORTHLESS! It's been rumored they are making DLC for it, but it makes me realize why this game was only $30.tl;dr: At $60, this game would be a cruel joke, at $30 it's worth the fun of spawning your inner most imagination on-screen to appease the people that inhabit the World around you, beyond that... well, Scibblenauts Unlimited is actually a bit Limited."

,Recommended,218680,13224840,"Posted: 4 December, 2014",all,McFlamebutt,"Scribblenauts Unlimited takes a diffrent approach to the pats two installments, mostly by making itself an 'open world' game, as opposed to a series of puzzles. This is both a virtue and a vice, because it means there's a lot to see and do, but it reduces the puzzle missions to being the occasional treat, with most of the games collectibles - Starities and Starite Shards, if you're unfamiliar with this series - being obtained through quickfire tasks that build towards Starites - think Heart Containers/Pieces in Zelda, and I suppose that makes a tad more sense.Still, the game is still very enjoyable and plays pretty nicely, but a few of the puzzles feel like they don't have the potential for multiple outcomes - this as something the past two games emphasised with a lot of Starites coming from having to complete previous missions without repeating previously used words.What it lacks in depth, Unlimited makes up for in diversity of puzzles.And besides, any game that lets you create a pink Cthulhu wearing a pair of sunglasses is still a win in my book."

We decided to wait a little since she was just learning to sound words out at school at the time.6 months later and this is my girlfriend's daughter's favourite game.  She's sounding out and spelling words like ""violinist"", ""firetruck"", ""invincible"" (she seriously got it on her own except for an s in place of the c, and that's an easy mistake to make really).Quick warning for parents: we unexpectedly had to explain what cannibalism was.  She spent a few days talking about ""the guy who wouldn't eat hamburgers and mommy gave him a person and he ate him.""  It was awkward.  She didn't seem terribly marked by it (she just says eating people is gross) but it may not be suitable for all children her age; control the media your child consumes and try to supervise so you can find talking points (for instance, ""is it ok to eat your neighbors?"")"

You can create pretty much anything from the vast variety of words available and have fun with it. The puzzles are, as I said, vast. All of them are unique.

When I noticed there was a version of the game on steam, i immediately decided to get it.This is not something i regret. There is alot of fun to be had in having almost complete control over creation. The game clearly has a massive.. point, in helping children learn how to spell, and gives incentive to knowing masses of words.For the adult audience, we get a more advanced version of enjoyment coming from already having gone through such education, and knowing these words already. While some words can come up with entirely odd things (If you type ""Lucifer"" you get a blue shrimp.) most words that i've found, or used, tend to be extremely accurate so far as what they make.The fact that Cthulhu is spawnable is one thing, but setting Cthulhu into battle against God, Satan and Odin can be hilarious. I personally like to let them all fight for a bit, and turn them into doves. However the puzzles tend to be extremely easy, and once you've got a few words that work, you'll tend to rely on them, to the exclusion of others.This game is as fun as you have imagination. Sure, you can spawn rational objects and have a dull time, or you can run around with a giant flaming chocolate chainsaw, while riding a mechanical dragon and fighting ninja. (This actually happened.)"

,Recommended,218680,7881648,"Posted: 2 December, 2013",all,Shabadoo,"Scribblenauts is an ingenious little game.This is exactly the type of creative game I expect to see in almost 2014. If you aren't familiar with Scribblenauts the game is basically a puzzle game that you have to use your imagination to solve the puzzles.The story revolves around a boy who gains ownership of a magical notebook. Anything that the boy writes in the notebook becomes real. Similarly, the words you type into the game appear before your eyes. If I were to type floating spotted firebreathing bathtub, then thats exactly what I would see appear in the game.The puzzles are mostly very simple, though I would still say its fun for all ages as I am an adult and even I had fun playing it.The only flaws the game has are that many of the puzzles are very similar and you tend to solve them the same way. The game usually doesn't put any kind of restriction on how many times you can use a word, which means i can solve 10 puzzles the same way if I wanted to which I feel takes away from the puzzle aspect of the game.For instance, once i found out i could add attributes to my own character, i made him ""invisible superspeed tiny flying invincible"" which lets you beat the missions in probably half the usual time or less but again takes away from the fun of the game. My only other complaint is that theres not much in the game that can kill you, even the things that do attack you take so many hits to kill you that you can easily stop them. They should have included a difficulty setting in the games menu.Conclusion:  Over all I would give Scribblenauts a 8/10 in the category of childrens puzzle games. I would value it at up to 15$. Great game!"

The game runs like charm, music is great, the stuff you can create is mind-blowingly a lot, and the puzzle is still good and funny! Why is it funny, i dunno but the fact that you can see a zombie sled down a snowy mountain slope with a brain is pretty funny.You have a bagpack to store stuff so you don't have to type it again, especially if the name of the item is long. The auto-correct and word suggestion mechanic really save my butt a lot.Some part of the puzzles really test your vocabulary and understanding of um, words.I really wish they could've put a ""create your own world"" part in the game, like in NDS you can make your own room and stuff.Steam Workshop support is implemented into this, which lets the players to get items that are not in the game, or even submit stuff that the players created that are not in the game.

Someone has a problem, and you fix it by creating something using your notebook. The game has a surprisingly big dictionary, allowing you to make hobbits, laser swords, cloning machines, portals, the horsemen of the apocolypse, ""Baberaham Lincoln"", hell, even Nyan Cat. Of course there are some things that you can't make, but you can create anything that you think should be in the game. Despite being labelled as a kid's game, the puzzles in this game can be extremely confusing at times. It can get almost annoying. Now, for most puzzle games, super annoying puzzles that take an hour to figure out is a turn-off. However, this is not the case for Scribblenauts. The game spaces these hard puzzles out, and you don't have to complete a world completely to unlock a new one, meaning one puzzle never keeps you from seeing the rest of the game. However, the game isn't without it's faults. While some puzzles are super hard, most of them are extremely simple. Nearly all of the puzzles in the game can be solved without much thought. It's really disapointing. Also, while the game runs fairly smoothly, there are the occasional lag spikes (although that may just be my crappy computer) All in all, though. this is a great game. It's so much fun mix-matching items and adjectives to see what you can make. I really do think it's worth the $20."

A pistol spawns in his hand and the bully runs away scared.Additionally, you can just goof around in each level, messing with the inhabitants, making weird things, etc...It's a game you will eventually finish and probably get bored of later, but if you want a very casual and easy game with some unexpected laughs, give this a try!

I've nearly beaten the game after several months (playing only a small ammount each week) and I still consider it fun after about ten hours of non-continuous gameplay. For the $20.00 it costs to buy it at its regular price I feel like I have gotten my moneys worth out of it though I might suggest waiting for a sale if you are not sure if you want it or not.In terms of gameplays though I can see people getting annoyed at the fairly repetitive nature of the game play which ammounts to see some people with a problem, firguring out what they need to solve the problem, typing it in the book then giving them that item. And while I aggree that it does get annoying if you are planning on trying to beat it in a single sitting I think the game is ment to be played in short bursts, which is the way that I have been playing it and have found it quite fun.The only other problem I have found is that sometimes it doesn't know simple items like winter coat, instead you have to kind of simplify the idea down to its more basic components (such as wool jacket for winter coat).Overall I would recomend this game for children or people who just like a simple, fun puzzle game.P.S you can summon cthulhu and have him battle robot pigs, so there's that."

Gone are the days of typing out letters painstakingly with the stylus of the Nintendo DS, the PC truly is the best platform without dispute in the case of this game and its mechanics, which involves typing out relevant words to solve puzzles. The puzzles can usually be solved in a multitude of ways. Just like Pokemon, Basic reading skills are required along with some vocabulary knowledge.

This is a puzzle game where you solve people's problems by spawning objects according to clues they give you. There really isn't much to it, but it makes you think. This is a game for kids, so if you're an adult and you have enough education, you'll just breeze through it, but it'll still be a fun expierence. The graphics are charming and not very demanding, so you can play this with a medium-tier PC. The amount of things you can spawn is amazing, you can really feel the dedication the developers put into the making of this game. The Workshop features are nice, if a little useless in-game but still neat to have.

The main puzzle-solving content is less filled-out than previous games, and on the whole it is significantly easier than some of the challenges presented by earlier games. In this light, it is generally not as good of a puzzle game as its predecessor. Largely, the game shines because of the Community workshop, allowing players to integrate customized words into the game's framework to mess around with (though there are fewer options of locale to mess around in, a sorry loss from the previous game).The game has added significantly with regards to the words you can use, but it has unfortunately taken something away from the other endearing features of the series."

The solutions can be as simple or as creative as you want them to be. I really applaud the developers for this one. I can't imagine how long it took to create all the objects that are possible to draw in this game.The story isn't anything too special; you're saving your sister by getting these shards from the levels. The story isn't really why you play this game though, it's for the super creative gameplay. I thought the level designs were fun, some requiring you to go underwater or fly up high.

To me, this is more of an abnigation game, and it must be a pretty good one if I play it. You spend most of your time goofing off, spawning random things, or solving problems in awkward ways. On that note, ever wonder why Rudolf's nose glows? I made him radioactive, then Santa forced him to run over flaming ice mounds >=D.As far as gameplay, the more interesting puzzles feel a bit like buzzword. Too bad they all but give you the answer eventually, but ultimately it is your choice whether or not to peak, so that's nice. This certainly isn't a very difficult game. If any degree of challenge is what you are looking for, I suggest you look elsewhere. If you want a game to just derp around and do random stuff, this game will make time fly.One thing I do wish this game had were more modes. As it is, you only have a story mode. A sandbox mode would be perfect for this game. As well as a mode for making or accomplishing challenges apart from the main game. Of course, I haven't completed the game yet, so maybe more modes are unlocked on completion, but somehow I doubt it.Overall, a game that offers a nice break if you are frustrated with life or another game, but don't expect to take this game seriously or you will be disappointed.

I mean, you don't scribble in the game, you write words in the game, not make pictures or something like that. The unlimited in the title really isn't true. For example, I put in Doge in the notebook and It didn't work at all. Yes, I know the developers at WB Games and 5th Cell didn't know what Doge was but still, it's not unlimited. Also, some of the puzzles seem confusing to me like the car that was parked illegally. I didn't even KNOW I was supposed to (Spoiler)give it a parking ticket until I got the hint for it. There's other bad stuff too, but that's enough bad stuff, let's talk about some good stuff. The missions are fun to think up what ballistic thing you're going to use to fix the problem because hey, it's not unlimited, but there's still TONS of things to create in the game.  The game is GINORMOUS, with tons and tons of places to go and collect Starites and Starite Shards. The Object Editor I like as well. I also like that you can upload or share you're creations from the Object Editor to Steam Workshop.

You dress up as a samurai with a blue mouldy bazooka riding a flying robotic squid through the sky.

Once you beat the game, there is no way to reset or start over without trying to access your save in the cloud. You can replay missions, but trying to help the people on each map is tough because you cannot see what they want after beating the map the first time.

76561198063441386,Recommended,218680,16430268,"Posted: 15 June, 2015",all,Secret Steve,"As an unaltered game, it is wonderful. The story is strange but fun and the art style is absolutely adorable. Some shard-obtaining methods and items that can be spawned in are clever references to pop culture such as the shard obtained upon riding a yacht, ""I'm on a boat!"" and the items 'Ceiling Cat,' 'Monorail Cat,' and of course, 'Nyan Cat.' Most objects in the game work very well and move smoothly. I have found few glitches and bugs with the exception that when the player has the adjective 'Awesome' applied, other nearby human characters will not perform some of their programmed tasks, even if they are player-created. Also, one shard was  particularly hard to get but for a reason I don't know why. If the player spawns in an Angel of either gender and provides him/her with an Angel Food Cake, depending on the map, said creature will not eat the food. I tried to do so in the castle level, and it didn't work until I went to ""Hyphen Heights."" The workshop works so well to this game's advantage and it's great to see so many fans of different things partake in creating their own people, places, weapons, and other items. While the game may not be perfect, it's close and there aren't many things about it I don't like except some of the music and the before-mentioned bugs. I'd rate it a 9.7/10."

I could actually play without buying anything I wasn't already in the market for.Now, this game absolutely blew me away when I realized that the idea isn't to find something that should obviously work... but to come up with the craziest idea that *might* work. There was one moment where I tried to go Monty Python... and it worked! I was literally on the verge of tears from sheer laughter.And that's the genius of Scribblenauts: you never know if something odd is going to work, but it does often enough to keep you guessing."

,Recommended,218680,19668180,"Posted: 12 December, 2015",all,Darksilverhawk,"I give this game a tentative recommendation. Personally, I didn't find it to be as engaging as some past entries in the series. I find the open world format actually limits the puzzle solving somewhat. There are no longer puzzles that must be solved in a number of different ways, and no way to re-solve anything you've completed, so I often found myself simply taking the path of least resistance. The main plot wraps itself up several areas short of the end of the game, provided you're clearing most puzzles, which leaves those last few areas in a strange place of ""not quite post-game, not quite proper game."" The word puzzles found in the menu are also probably some of the weakest puzzles I've ever seen from a Scribblenauts game. Instead of presenting an engaging challenge, they simply turn into a large game of ""guess what the devs were thinking."" For the overworld puzzles once solved they're solved for good and with only one save slot the replayability of the game is somewhat limited unless you're willing to do a hard reset.All that aside though, most of the puzzles are well thought-out and offer both an easy path and allow you to think outside the box. The object interactions are fun and the game is full of little easter eggs. It is a fun game, and if you've enjoyed Scribblenauts games in the past you'll probably like it and if you've never played one before this isn't a bad place to start."

,Not Recommended,218680,32966217,Posted: 28 June,all,ApolloJaguar,"I really like this game. The storyline is cool, graphics look great, and the very best part about the game is the fact that you get to fool around with the notebook. The world is in your hands, and that's what makes it so entertaining. However, no games are flawless. What I didn't like about Scribblenauts, is that the vocabulary is actually quite small. A lot of the time, I type something and they don't understand what it is. Still, I definitely recommend it.UPDATE: Ok; so after playing this for a longer period of time, I realize that this game is rather repetitive. It has a really short storyline to which ends after about 10 completed locations. There is also a huge glitch in ""Dot the Island"" which has a missing shard. I looked around online, and from what I see, it's supposed to be one where you make a siren more attractive. However I don't see a yellow glow once I activated the starite vision. So I really can't do anything here. In conclusion, after more or less completing the game, I would say that it isn't worth getting it. As mentioned even before my update, the vocabulary is incredibly small, and you can't experiment all that much with that disabling your creativity flow."

But unlike the original Scribblenauts, in ""Unlimited"" every ""puzzle"" has a trivial and obvious solution. If an NPC is hungry, just type ""meat"" and move on. If someone wants to craft a snowman from a single snow ball, just give them a stick, and the rest of the snowman magically appears. You can also modify other NPCs, so if you need to pass through a guard, no sweat: just edit the NPC and give him the ""blind"" adjective (or give yourself the ""invisible"" adjective). There's absolutely no thinking process. It's boring for adults, it's boring for kids.Sure, it's a beautiful game with lots of possibilities. If a canibal is hungry, you can give them fruits and convince them to go vegan... or you can give them a baby. It's your choice, and it's kind of fun. Unfortunately, it gets old very fast."
