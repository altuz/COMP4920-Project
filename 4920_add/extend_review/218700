It felt very short, there was too much random clicking to find what you wanted to in the puzzles and not much interaction with anything besides Angelica's thoughts and some piece of information."

It has a wonderful story about a clairvoyant female detective chasing a serial killer through time, and all the puzzles are fun.  I think the devs did a great job of integrating the puzzles with the story.  I really enjoyed the back and forth through time mechanic, and I found the main character to be really likeable.  The few times that I got stuck were because something had changed that I didn't notice at first, but usually it was a very logical progression, which was nice.  It's a shame there are no Steam achiements since there are cool achievements in game.  Also, when you complete the game, you unlock a bonus chapter that totally twists the ending."

The hidden object scenes were cool, a good throw back to those kids magazines you find in the dentist office.  =PAlso.....Angelica is one hell of a cleptomaniac......"

Difficulty is light and almost too novice friendly and thus playthrough won't last much more than few hours, but this is not necessarily a bad thing if you prefer exciting storyline more than hard puzzles."

Some puzzles are difficult but you don't get stuck on them. Very well balanced, nice graphics and sound. Yes, I liked it, even it's not my kind of game, Angelica Weaver got my attention and I'm not disappointed at all. Have fun, guys."
,Recommended,218700,17807654,"Posted: 30 August, 2015",all,Emblem Parade,"A good casual point-and-click adventure with several hidden-object scenes and puzzles.The story is an engaging murder mystery involving some time travel. It's fairly long and has quite a bit of content! It manages to avoid the worst clichés and focus on the plot and gameplay. It might not be the best, but fans of the casual point-and-click genre are sure to enjoy it!I live in Chicago, so I especially enjoyed the Chicago scenes and atmosphere. :)"

I love crime solving gamesGood balance between puzzles and hidden objects.The fact that you go back in time to resolve cold cases is really refreshing.You also have achievements you can get, that gives the game a little more «oomph» and you can try to get them all by doing the game again. Give you challenges along the way.I loved it."
,Recommended,218700,16960766,"Posted: 9 July, 2015",all,Muir,"Fantastic hidden object and puzzle game with a couple of ""didn't see that coming"" twists.InAngelica Weaver: Catch Me When You Can, you play the part of Angelica Weaver, psychic detective. Your mission is to solve a murder by hunting for clues in both the past and the present. This is done, unsurprisingly, by finding objects and solving puzzles.The puzzles aren't too difficult, but a lot of them are quite challenging and require patience and ""thinking outside the box"". As far as graphics and story, this game is actually among one of the best I've played in this genre. The graphics are smooth and good quality, and while the voice acting won't win any awards, it's still quite good, especially compared to a lot of other games in the hidden object/puzzle game genre.I wouldn't recommend paying full price for this game, as it's quite short (I finished it in less than 3 hours), but if you see it at 50%+ sale, then it's worth grabbing."

I've tried it several times on two computers, deleting the files and starting over as recommended in the support section.  I get a little farther, then up comes the debug error again and the game won't load.  I suspect this is no longer supported, but they keep taking money for it.  It's a shame, because it's a pleasant game with reasonable graphics.  I would love to finish it. Instead, I must steer folks away from it unless they have money to gamble that this won't happen to them.  I'm running on Windows 8 with up-to-date drivers, etc., yada, yada.  Good luck if you go for it!"
,Recommended,218700,13941936,"Posted: 11 January, 2015",all,Astrid,"I have never really played this type of game before, so was pleasantly surpised. I had suspected it would be boring and frustrated, but instead it was relaxing and enjoyable. I did not really understand the story completely, but the puzzles were straightforward, and navigation and art work very good. I liked the character, and the way the hint system worked, was good. In the end with the bonus content it took me around 6 hours to finish. Worth getting when on sale.To provide some more detail:Basicaly you move between times to solve a serious of murders. It has four elements in it, point and click movement, colelct and use objects to solve problems, puzzle solving (fit shapes, destack in right order, word find, untangle), and hidden object. It includes a hint system, where you build up hints by finding dream catchers, or you wait for the hint bar to fill which takes a few seconds. The annimation is good, and there is a couple jump scares. The use of objects is well thought out and makes sense most of the time. There are a couple of things to do or find where I cant see how you would have worked it out without using the hints.So I liked it, it the type of game you do once, and this six hours of game play."

The concept of a psychic cop solving crimes and going back to Jack the Ripper's day in ye' old London, solving those crimes, and then using them to help her solve the case she's working on in the present is very uniqie and entertaining. I give gold stars for originality plot wse but ultimately it's just not well done and comes across as slow and dull. If you like point and click/puzzle solving games or appreciate unique plot buy it on sale"
