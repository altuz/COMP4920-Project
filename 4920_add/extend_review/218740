However, Pid is a wonderful platformer and anyone who prefers puzzles over the plot might like it.Pros:- Unique gameplay mechanics- Beautiful platformer graphics- Great puzzle difficulty build up- Unique characters and worldCons: (for me)- Absent story line- Slow paced levels- No character development- No new abilities (2 hours in and no new powers)"

The game is pretty darn long and while your not hating the game while playing it, after the first sitting your probably going to find yourself just wanting to get to the end....Pid is just kinda boring...It's more of a platformer than a puzzle game. There are a few satisfying puzzles, but mostly you don't get that invested in overcoming the puzzles because they are just little stops between platforming. For me a big sign that a game isn't very compelling is if I am willing to cheat...I love puzzle platformers, and in games like Limbo and Inside I never considered cheating, but in Pid there where a few point where its like ""what am i supposed to do? ehh this game is dragging♥♥♥♥♥ let just looks this up and get to end already"" Did Limbo and Inside in 6ish hours but they didn't feel like short or long games cause pacing was great...Pid took 20 some hrs ugh.FOR A GAME THAT FOCUSES ON PLATFORMING THE CONTROLS ARE FLOATY AND MUSHY...thats my biggest gripe....I need to be able enter and exit beams in a consisten way and throw beams in a certain direction with some reliability.Pro's-Unique Art style-Interesting universe and story-Good music at times...Very chill wich is unique for this type of game-Voice acting is cool and diolouge is goodCon's-Controls will make you throw things at times...especially thowing beams and trying to exit them with any precision-Combat is pretty meh-You just sort of want the game to end after not to long...I'm not sure why...maybe the story isn't that gripping...not that satisfying to advance the plot"
,Not Recommended,218740,29107333,Posted: 7 January,all,LitWarrior,"First I'd like to say that I dont hate the game. The graphics are enjoyable and beautifully rendered, the style is great, character design and everything are fantastic. The story is interesting and enjoyable. The mechanic of the lifting beams is very cool and makes for a great puzzle platformer. The problem I have is with the level design.The first few ""worlds"" are really fun; not difficult, but they make you think, and you feel good for completing them. The early bosses are fun too. After a while though, around the point where -*-SPOILERS-*- you enter the city atop the castle, things start to get really frustrating. What was a linear series of puzzles became a sort of Wizards and Warriors kind of very large room with random platforms and hazards throughout, including some tough enemies and spikes, and long fall distances, coupled with strange checkpoint locations that make you start in the wrong place if you fall the wrong way. It makes it more platforming focused, and in my opinion, the mechanics of the beams and the jumping don't work well for a fast pace, precision oriented platformer. When you get to this point, expect to die a LOT; and while dying doesnt mean much since there is no game over or anything, starting off at a far back or wrong checkpoint after barely missing a tiny platform and falling onto a bullet in motion can feel very frustrating.Now they tend to keep rooms like that to a minimum, when you come across them it's easy to not know where to go, and to feel like you're missing things. Eventually I got tired dying so many times in one spot that I just gave up and went the easy way to the exit, forfeiting any would-be hidden items for the sake of just completing the game. When you get to that point, it's like, why even play the game at all? But past that specific ""room"" the puzzles just flat out get worse. They're all about precise timing and movement and not about thinking and figuring things out - which would be fine if the game hadn't taught me to think otherwise. I eventually just stopped playing because the puzzles were too annoying, I kept dying unfair deaths and felt cheated. The puzzles were easy to figure out by then, but hard to accomplish because of the tight platforming and the NUMEROUS enemies and hazards.Overall, the game could stand to be more linear in the large levels or have more and better checkpoints, they should get rid of many of the enemies, and make the puzzles more thought oriented instead of reflex oriented.If you're a masochist and like puzzles more frustrating and difficult than the worst of Limbo, then this is a great game, but honestly I wouldn't recommend it to a friend, at least not without some kind of balancing patch. Maybe I'll try it on easy mode someday and change my review, but ""notmal"" is way too hard and frustrating to be enjoyable."
76561198089014841,Recommended,218740,13033906,"Posted: 21 November, 2014",all,Sparkle Pony,"Splendid game. I actually purchased it three times; once on Xbox Live, and twice on Steam for myself and a friend.Firstly, the visual style is superb. As well as creating a rich sense of depth with blurs and diffused lighting, there seems also to be a seperate layer of color grading (shadows tinted blue, highlights tinted orange) which is why many screenshots have a cinematic aura about them.The light beam mechanic quickly becomes second nature, and I find myself missing it when I hop over to other platformers. The gameplay is more of a navigational puzzler than a logic one, and there's a nice steady progression of what you can do with the beams which prevents it from becoming stale.I'm a fan of ""strange world"" concepts in games. Pid in particular creates a surprisingly inviting atmosphere for a planet of mechanical characters. What's more, each citizen is unique in appearance, which could've been an easy cop out for the devs if they decided that robots would be mass produced in one model. A fine level of variation worth noting. The length of the game was also pretty satisfying. It's taken me between 12 to 13 hours each time I've played through, though it felt much longer.Finally, and without giving anything away, the last few sections of gameplay were just brilliantly executed. The music/sound design, art direction, physics, storyline, and everything else, all came together in those final moments to ensure a great memory of a great game."

The core mechanics feel great but the game built around them is unfocused. Something about the level design feels clumsy as though the developers were not quite sure what to do with the mechanics. It's alright but after BC: Rearmed I was expecting another classic which it definitely isn't. Looks and sounds great but is ultimately underwhelming.

Lovely art style and soundtrack, neat mechanics - I didn't make much use of some of the powerups but I'm assuming that's based on play style - and a meaty length, as well as that thing I particularly love when a game pulls it off, a smooth and organic progression through the world. This is on a par with Half-Life 2 for how it moves between scenes. I approve entirely. Some frustrating repetition not enough to dull my pleasant memories of this game.

,Recommended,218740,24253002,"Posted: 11 July, 2016",all,WoodrowShigeru,"pid is a lovely 2D platforming puzzle adventure game with a gorgeous visual aesthetic, and a charming, somewhat extra-ordinary story about a boy who, on his bus ride home from school, gets lost and trapped on a distant planet where the interplanetary traffic has died down for centuries.Unfortunately however, the controls are too floaty which makes for a frustrating platforming experience. The music is okay in itself and definitely sports a colorful variety, but it gets fairly annoying in die-a-lot sections. Same for some of the sound FX. Speaking of sounds: Kurt's footsteps sound way too heavy for a little boy, which threw me off the entire time. There are difficulty spikes all over the place, and especially the chase scenes are absolutely abysmal. If I were to guess, I'd say this game hasn't been playtested thoroughly.I wish some of the checkpoints were placed differently (for instance, not at the beginning of a cutscene). As for the gameplay, it *is* innovative at times, I'll give it that, but … bottom line: I did not enjoy myself much of the time;  I did not enjoy playing through this game. Even though I did finish pid, the experience was all in all too frustrating.5.5/1o(I have to pick Yes or No? Hm … then I rather do recommend this, but with a caution)."
,Recommended,218740,313781,"Posted: 24 March, 2013",all,Polly,"Pid is a game that is seriously at odds with itself. On one hand it wants to be an atmospheric and dreamy little puzzle platformer that has great sense of style and a fun take on traversal, and on the other it wants to be a masocore platformer, killing you over and over again until you get it right. These elements unfortunately never come together.  It feels like two entirely different games shoved into a room and told to play nice, but they never really want to.Pid's strong suit is its take on using gravity to get yourself around the world and using it to solve simple room puzzles to progress. When the game sticks to that, it's fun, and as it tucks more and more items into your inventory to play around with, the mechanics can get quit advanced and demand a lot of your critical thinking and reflexes. When the level design allows for creativity in passing obstacles with your collected items, Pid excels head and shoulders above most puzzle platformers.The parts of Pid that are out for your blood however really drag the game into the mud. When the game decides to go all ""Action Game"" mode, you're being asked to perform tasks that the laboured character movement, weapons that are needlessly hard to work with, and weak jumping arc simply can't provide. Enemies in this game work better when they're used as obstacles or a means to complete a puzzle.When on display, Pid's amazignly realized world, fantastic jazzy soundtrack, and fun gravity puzzle mechanics are when it feels truly alive and sure of itself. Real shame about those parts that don't work, though."

Until you reach an obstacle. And die. Over and over until you figure it out just at the moment you're about to punch a hole through your screen and strangle your neighbor's cat. There are plenty of discoverables to challenge you, but the last thing this game needed was a bigger challenge. Not that it's hard — the solutions are right in front of you, they're just barely capable of being executed.In the end, I look forward to what Might and Delight will come up with in the future. Although, I think I’d be more excited to see them switch gears and produce an animated children’s TV series. The visual and sound design, the soundtrack, and the cast of characters was what made this game top notch, not necessarily the gameplay."

I love pretty much everything about it, but you do need a very patient hand. Kurt moves unfortunately slowly, and you generally can't breeze through puzzles... gameplay and mechanics and such are fine, but again it takes a fair amount of patience.The game lets you figure things out on your own, it tells you only what it deems necessary and you're left to explore, trying to escape the planet Kurt is trapped on. There's no hand-holding in this game, and at times it can be quite unforgiving. One of the reviewers mentions that they don't expect the game to have much length - do not listen to this person. There is much to explore, you will die trying to solve puzzles, and the bosses will stomp on you. This isn't a quick game you're going to get through in a couple of hours. Pid is beautiful and you will surely get your money's worth, if you're willing to stick it out and take on the challenge."

There are many times where a checkpoint will save your progress beyond a place with an item, so that if you fail on your first attempt, there is no way to go back and try again. Or the checkpoint will be back far enough so that if you die you have to redo much of the level.Seems that the game was designed for controllers, not a keyboard+mouse, as there the game's functionality would be significantly improved if you could actually *aim* your light beams with a mouse. For example, consider Ori and the ability to aim where you shoot.I got about 4 hours of gameplay before getting frustrated to the point where I never want to play again, and not because of difficulty, but rather because of poor checkpoints, poor controls, and annoying enemies."

These are the best aspects of the game.The gameplay / basic mechanics essentially boil down to:1. Basic platforming (at which the game is mediocre and sometimes bad)2. Throwable levitation pebbles.The levitation pebbles are an item which you have an unlimited supply of. You throw them at a surface and it creates a sort of tractor beam rising up from the surface at which you threw it. If you throw it on the floor, you get a vertical beam that levitates you upward. But you can also throw it at walls to get a horizontal beam that carries you across gaps and so on. There are also diagonal/slanting surfaces, which allow you to create beams that elevate you in a diagonal direction. The pebbles can also be used to push enemies off of edges, lift them into spiky ceilings, and so on.However, the game is extremely repetitive, the platforming feels mostly boring, the controls don't feel very tight, and the levitation beams are more difficult to use than you'd like them to be. What starts off as a relaxing stroll of a platformer through a beautiful world of child-like whimsy soon becomes death after death after death, as the game repeatedly punishes you for failing to demonstrate accuracy and precision using a very innacurate and imprecise toolset.6/10 is a pretty fair rating, in my opinion. It's definitely not an awful game, and it's worth checking out just for the interesting art/atmosphere. But it's also not a particularly great game. Worth checking out if some of your favorite things are platformers, light puzzling, and constant repeated deaths. Otherwise, you may find the gameplay isn't as captivating as that wonderful art makes it look.Art/atmosphere: 9/10Gameplay: 5/10Overall: meh / 10"

It wants to be a puzzle platformer, but the puzzles are too simple to be challenging, and the controls are too squishy to platform. The controls are especially frustrating during boss fights.I think it was about the second boss fight where the game really started to go off the rails for me. Everything up until that point made sense within the world and lore of the game, but the second boss is just completely ridiculous for no reason. There isn't even any reason for him to be there story-wise. It's just something that happens to annoy you.Also, some sections require exploration and a lot of backtracking, which I normally don't mind for something like a metroidvanian game, but with Pid it's just tedious.I think this is my main problem with Pid. A lot of the design choices seem to artifically lengthen the game for no reason.I haven't beaten it yet, and I'm doubting I will, because after an obnoxious scavenger hunt section, I was rewarded with an hour of wandering aimlessly in a level literally called ""Maze"". It's just another example of how the game likes to grind its gameplay and story to a halt so you're forced to spend more time with it.It's really outstayed its welcome for me.EDIT: I finally got through the maze, and now there's a chase sequence. This game has lost all its charm for me. The controls are ~not~ tight enough to do the kind of platforming it requires. I'm done with it."

,Not Recommended,218740,270760,"Posted: 18 August, 2013",all,Abbe,"TL;DR: Bad gamedesign and leveldesign ruins a good looking game and causing massive rage from someone who wants to pick up all of the things.Long version:So this game… ♥♥♥♥ this game. Don’t buy it.Ok, maybe a bit harsh, but I’ll try to explain why I feel that way.I will begin with the good thing: The graphics.The style of the graphics, or the focus, I say, is the lighting and atmosphere, they have very noise-free textures, and focus more on the models and the edges, I have to say that most of the time I loved it, although it never reached a crazy level of amazement.With that out of the way: The bad.The bad in the game is just the whole design. From what I’ve heard they wanted to create a “hard game of the past” and made the normal difficulty in this tone, theres nothing really bad in doing that and I enjoy a challenge normally. The puzzles or levels start out kind of complicated and they continue from that. I can live with that, a challenge is something to overcome. However, here’s where the extremely bad thing comes in: Stupid ♥♥♥♥ing Gamedesign Decisions.As in most games, when you take damage, you get a short invulnerability time to recover. Their time is about 1 second, which mean that your character might not even land on the ground before taking the second point of damage, which means death. This, of course, is if you have armor on you, if you don’t, you just die instantly.The game consists of moving about on the levels using a ball that you can drop to create air lifts, you need to attach that to walls, platforms, lift enemies and other things, and it works pretty well. Until you fall down onto an old area you just were inside so you have solve that area again. So not only did I fail, but I now have to move my way back to where I was to try and move on again.But here comes the closing deal for my 3 hours with this game. I am somewhat of an achiever, not anal, but if I see something that I can pick up, then I will ♥♥♥♥ing pick it up. And within 20 minutes of gameplay, the game locked me away from two of these pickups because of bad checkpoints.So what happened was: I traversed a room full of spikes on every side, climbing and managing the ballthrowing as I should, carrying the key to the door where I needed to go. Key unlocks door, I jump down at the door to look around at the optional route I saw above me outside from where I just came. I go up and yes, here’s a puzzle with a pickup as a reward. Naturally (because bad designers) you have a risk of dying while trying to solve the puzzle, because that’s fun!I make a few tries and eventually I figure out how to solve the puzzle, but get stuck in a bad way and fall down on spikes and die. And respawns down by the door. Which is now closed. I cannot get back to the pickup.I cannot backtrack, at all.Now at this point I have played for about 3 hours, I’m kind of♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off because the game is annoying to play and have very untight controls, but not willing to quit just yet, I move on.Then it happens again, barely 20 minutes later, similar situation with a door and an optional route and a puzzle where you can die. I don’t even remember how the area looks like now, but when it happened I just alt-F4’d the game.Don’t buy this piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥"

,Recommended,218740,691997,"Posted: 27 April, 2013",all,liminal18,"After about 10 years of using Ubuntu and it's easy to manage packages I decided to make the move to Gentoo, a slightly more obscure linux variant with much fewer help. In Ubuntu occassionally I would blow stuff up, installing a new programming language would mess up something or maybe an update would conflict my own software, in Ubuntu I was never more than a few minutes away from a kind chat room and some decent help. Gentoo on the other hand kicked my♥♥♥♥♥ I actually managed to delete windows when installing Gentoo, then I had to access the internet from a command life before I could get into Gnome which in turn turned out to be a hassle because Gnome was doing a controversial upgrade only partially supported by the Gentoo community. I really thought I knew a lot about Linux before Gentoo, it turned out knowing a lot about Linux meant being on the road to a computer science degree. In the forums, I could go days with out a reply to my messages, and ops often didn't have answers as simple or easy to follow as the Ubuntu folks, the end result was that a simple global update might take 2 weeks of weeding through errors, manuallying compiling libraries, pruning independencies, it was a nightmare. Pid is a lot like that experience. The game is tough. How tough? It's so hard they had to add an easy mode. This comes in a day and age in which difficultly is often praised as a feature in games. Pid doesn't reward you for failure, you don't get a cute animation, and often you already know the sequence to the puzzle Pid is asking you to solve, it's merely getting the timing right that makes it hard. You also die in one hit at the beginning, you do get sweat shirts later on that pile up into a small comfort zone, but Pid also lacks a few seconds of invulnerability after being hit, hence one bad fall onto an enemy can destroy your entire safety net. However, if you perserve great things await you. The game becomes a Miyamoto like pile of mechanics. Pid is organized into small sections which often operate idependently of each other. The mechanic in one part will disapate into a new one in the next room. Pid doesn't lack ideas. It also has a mega man style inventory that grows into items which while rarely used (I never used the boots the entire game) are the key to certain puzzles in the game. Pid is so difficult that one sequence of play taking at most 5 minutes to finish took me almost 2 weeks to complete (it turned out I needed to use bombs). The major problem with the difficultly is the way it doesn't reward variety of use the designers are so strern as to disallow alternative solutions forcing you into often ardous sequences of hand eye co-ordination), however making it through these puzzles does have it rewards. The later sections of PID open up into wonderful puzzle platformer segements that will keep you thinking and are thankfully laid out in such a manor that frequently dying to them isn't a chore. The art style is simply amazing and continues to excel the whole game through, the music hits a crescendo in the theater, but is original and well done. The story line lags, but the world tells a surrealist fable that's hard not to love. So essentially if you're the type of person who sit around debugging linux updates for weeks on end, or loved Braid to the bitter end of 100% completition, PID is definitely the game for you. It took 10 hours to finish it with over 637 deaths in total, but I am so glad I finished this game and got to see it for all it's worth. The challenge levels are also nice."

It has a few flaws (sometimes there are too many enemies on the same screen at the same time and it ends up making the screen too busy and difficult to navigate, for example), but the game, although difficult, is never infuriating (I'm looking at you They Bleed Pixels), has enough charm, length (~10 hours), great visuals and an incredible soundtrack. A Castle, a dinner room, a kitchen, an opera house. You will complete a world and want to keep playing, just to see what's next, even after hours into the game. Give Pid a chance, you won't regret it."

But to me, the enjoyment gained from pid is not undone by its difficulty. The repulsor beam, cruel mistress though it may be, once mastered leads to a not imprecise puzzle platformer that requires skill and mind both. But that difficulty is subdued in it sharpness by the wonderful moments that the player meets throughout the story. My personal favorite moment came when, whilst traversing the maze level, a traditionally tedious experience in most games, soft saxophone music started playing as you neared the exit, turning an otherwise trying level into a moment of sudden zen where the tone aided the design of the level. The story itself weaves these pleasent moments into a charming tale of a marooned little boy forced to fix the bus schedule of an alien world. And it's this story, this subdued tone, and the enjoyable gameplay that for me make this game well worth experiencing if you have the time to savor them."

I thoroughly enjoyed playing through it for all of those reasons, and that was enough for me not to rage quit throughout it (though I did have to take pauses sometimes...) It was difficult at some times, the bosses were sometimes hard, the mechanics took some time to get used to, and the puzzles were a tiny bit confusing. BUT, despite all of that, I think it should be viewed as a challenge. And I'm a sucker for its story and adorableness.If you don't mind a challenge, you like platformers, a cool story, music, and puzzles, then I would recommend this. But if you get stressed out easily over things like this, maybe not... Either way, it's a creative concept and is a good game for what it is."

This game has impressive 3D graphics, though the game operates in two dimensions. The level design is excellent, and is made so few new features have to be formally introduced, but are rather taught to you subtly. It follows many major, yet basic, game design rules modern games often fail to address. Artistically, this game makes me squeal with joy. The lighting engine is brilliant. I especially enjoyed the outdoorsy bits, where it was very open-wordly. This game has a very simple premise, yet introduces new concepts consistently, even till the point where it introduced several major features in the last level. The bosses are clever, and require dexterity, as well as problem solving skills, as the rest of the game is. One of the biggest things about this game is its impressive co-op integration. Storyline-wise, NPC speech never addresses the second character, which is a bit of a shame, but gameplay-wise, it's done amazingly. With a second player, each player has less maneuverability, but together new tasks can be accomplished. It's a nice trade-off, and yet, none of the level design has to be changed for it to operate. I've played through the game almost two times now, and that filled 25 hours. Even now, I still have challenge rooms to complete, and easy and hard mode for new depth. I'm excited to continue this game, and would argue that it supplies a minimum of 40 hours to a player as dedicated as I am. I would give this game a solid 9.5 out of 10. Excellent game."
