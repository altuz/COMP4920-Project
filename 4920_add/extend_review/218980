,Not Recommended,218980,12428169,"Posted: 9 October, 2014",all,[UGUF] Merkules,"Yeah, this game is being removed from steam, but I still just wanted to say this is one of the worst examples of early access I own, and I own both Starforge and Paranautical Activity.The game had great potential and was even fun to play in the early builds, but then at some point the dev team went silent.  Then out of nowhere some changes started to be made.  These changes essentially removed some of the fun from playing with the physics, and limited creativity (I had planned on making a bouncy path to my house filled with tricky platforming...that's not possible anymore).  They also still listed on their website that the game has planetary gravity, even though that was removed months ago, so they falsely advertised features to get sales.These alone are bad enough, but I want to go back to focusing on the devs themselves.These are people that pretty much always had to be reminded to post patch notes whenever an update came out.  If people didn't do that, they wouldn't even bother.  They always talked about being able to create your own universe in early videos (they also mentioned water, which never made it into the game), but the truth is you can't make anything unless it's attached to something else first.  And then when you break a huge planet off after making it, guess what?  It will fall right back down, likely pushing you through the floor if you get hit.  Some universe...Considering all the problems the game had that were definitely in need of being fixed that got ignored (terrible camera, lack of information on making formations like bombs, multiple bugs with collision), I'd either say this was a scam from the start, or the dev team really is just that bad, either way, I'm not inclined to buy or recommend anything they make ever again.Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to play multiplayer just one last time before they shut down the servers..."

I have tried short tiny spurts over several months since I purchased it and realized there is just no point to this. Build what? Ok so you you can do some puzzles and jumping and share your stuff with others or even play other peoples things but what exactly is there to do besides that and doing the side collecting of blocks so you can make more things? This is the most boring game in history. I do not recommend this game. I am sorry but it is horrible. Little confusing platforms with no real idea as to what is going on. If they would of perhaps expanded this over the last 2 yrs it wouldn't be as terrible but besides some fixes and a new ui, there is really nothing here.The universe to create isn't really there because the maps are so TINY. There is no space like in minecraft or other sandbox creative games where you can build things and have a lot of room to do so. You can gather up blocks but then if they fall or break you have nothing. They simply just vanish. It is nice having a game with this concept that not everything is SQUARE blocks around you but this needs a whole lot more in order to feel like a true sandbox. Skip it for now and watch its progress if interested but there really isnt very much here going on with this game however from what I understand, they are no longer working on this game so there may not be any more work to it.Apparently this is just like the game ""windborne"" where the game looks good and gets people excited for more possiblities but then the devs go silent and vanish doing few fixes or offering few features or they get busy with their other games instead.I also don't care for physics in a sandbox game because  it limits and ruins the creativity for me of what I want to build, adding more limitations to what I want to make. For some people that is very exciting but for people who want to build whatever they want, this is annoying."

,Not Recommended,218980,16158483,"Posted: 3 June, 2015",all,Zion Fox,"My first review, and it's Negative.Patterns looked promising from the start. I quite enjoy Linden Lab's Second Life program, and them taking a different spin to content creation was quite a nice change. The whole thing turned very sour very quick however.Firstly, take into account that LINDEN LAB NO LONGER SUPPORT OR DEVELOP THIS GAME.Additionally, take every review and every feature list with a pinch of salt, a rather large one. Over half of the items from the features list up above do not exist, even a little bit, and never will due to the lack of development. They promised multiplayer, but I never saw it come. They promised AI animals or creatures, but it never happened. You spawn into the world in a very very lonely place, where not even people who want to join you can.If you do buy the game, take into account that Linden Lab do not know much about optimisation. Second Life proves this, only giving an average of 15 FPS in populated places. Patterns is similar, except worse due to the poor implementation of the physics engine. If you break something off and watch it collapse, prepare yourself for a spreadsheet demonstration of this collapse. Also, they don't believe in not drawing the object behind objects in front of you. If you create a house, walk outside and look at the front door which is closed, the entire interior, and backfacing walls are also drawn. This is very noticable when looking directly at the middle of the map, or the floor for example, because every layer is drawn.Heed the advice of the masses, do not buy this game. Do not support the developers who have already given up."

You use a crappy game to fund your projects and then abandon it and just cut it off completely. And honestly, for the game being as crappy as it is, it's so much better than SecondLife.

Especially now, years after the game has been discontinued.In addition, before discontinuing development, Linden Labs took away many features that made the game FUN. I've spent a good deal of time trying to figure out how to add qualities to blocks (i.e bounciness and propulsion, as advertised in the video above) and for the life of me I cannot find it. There's not evel a keybind for anything of the sort.Also, the servers for this game have been down for a long time, too, so you can't play with friends, and you can't share and/or try out community models and worlds. Basically the only fun thing to do is build structures and topple them down. Even then, If you don't have a great system, larger structures can butcher your framerate to unplayable levels when they fall.The only outstanding feature I can recall is the ""Telekinesis Beam"", this is really wonky and hard to control, I don't see its purpose other than to move or possibly throw an object. You can't control distance with keys. you have to either look at the place you want the object to go from an elevated position, or else it just moves to the maximum distance if you look away into empty space.The bottom line is, the game is NOTHING like what they show in the video, except for how it looks. I have yet to even find a creature like the ones seen in the teaser above. Maybe it would've been better if they had at least left in rockets, bouncy blocks, etc, but they didn't even leave us with that, which for some, might've even been a saving grace for lack of online features. It's such a shame they ruined the game before discontinuing development.Save money, buy something else. I'm very disappointed in this game.And now for a more personal gripe. Unfortunately for me, when I bought this game I was young and ignorant and I paid no attention to reviews, I was too excited for what I saw being advertised. This was also before steam had a good refund policy. In addition, my system at the time couldn't handle the game; it ran at an unplayable 1-2 fps. Now that I'm returning to it I really would love a refund, but unfortunately that's not possible at this point."
