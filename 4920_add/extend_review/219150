,Recommended,219150,16220580,"Posted: 6 June, 2015",all,Fancy Fish,"HOTLINE MIAMI - Fun, Fast, Challenging & Compelling|| 9 ||ScoreCommentGraphics8The 16-Bit style retro graphics are detailed and stylish, really adding to the overall atmosphere of the game. Everything from the characters you meet, the decor of buildings, the white 80's suits of the enemies to your car are all extremely well done and all add to the 80's Miami feel.Audio9Game music and effects are outstanding, you can hear the pounding beat of the music increase  in intensity as the levels progress and the game becomes ever more frantic. Although the music is looped it isn't repetitive and I found, even after dying for the tenth time in a row, it still felt fresh and exciting helping to throw you back into the fight.Gameplay9Hotline Miami is full of fast packed action, even best laid plans go astray in a moment forcing you to improvise, think on your feet and when all else fails rely on quick button pressing. As the levels progress the game becomes more challenging, but by this point your hooked and need to see the story through to the bitter end.Story9Dark & suspenseful, the story is surprising deep and engaging (for what on the surface appears to be a fairly simple game). Sometimes the game will leave you wondering exactly what is happening to you, sometimes small details will change between levels (who's that person in my apartment? who is ringing my phone?...) but they all help to weave they story of the characters decent into a world of crime, murder and madnessReplayability5There isn't much to say here, the story is linear so it mostly depends on how much you enjoyed playing the first time round. There are lots of masks to collect which give you certain bonuses that might appeal to completionists.Overall9A true gaming classic, retro 80's, ultra-violent, stylish, solid challenging game play with awesome music and a great story. lots of fun to play, highly recommended.More reviews by Fancy FishAgree / Disagree?

,Recommended,219150,10403383,"Posted: 8 June, 2014",all,Jingle Pyro,"If I had to sum this game up in two words, those two words would be frustratingly addictive.You will die. A lot.Don't make the assumption that this is a run-and-gun game. This is a thinking mans psychedelic 80's murder simulator. You will die learning a map layout. You will die figuring out when enemies will respond to gunfire. You will die due to glitchy doors. There is a lot of you dying in this game. But guess what there's also a lot of?Heart-pumping Adrenaline-gorged violence. No other game evokes the same sense of crazed desperateness as you pummel some poor Russian mobsters face into the dance floor, only to get up a split second later, grab his shotgun, and blow away the other Russian Mobsters who've been unfortunate to be in the same building as you.While the action is split second and fast-paced, the game rewards tactical planning and thinking more than twitch reactions. You will not succeed trying to run through a building swinging a baseball bat like a madman. You're going to have to bait enemies, burst into a room when no one's looking, and die several times perfecting ways to murder people.My only complaint is how vague the boss fights are. While I've only encountered two thus far, both of them have been pretty vague on how you actually win them. How the hell was a I supposed to figure out that I could only damage biker once he's throw his weapon whenthat isn't how the gameplay mechanics works at any other point previously?. The boss battles are inconsistent with the rest of the game.It can get frustrating, but it is intensely satisfying when you've cleared four separate floors after countless deaths trying.8/10, would recommend.-Jingle"

Hotline Miami wants you to kill a lot and to die a lot, violence and blood are the leitmotif of this 8-bit world. The game is both action and strategy, it even reminds Manhunt (transformed into indie retro). Bizarre sountrack and brutal gameplay fit together perfectly, and the story...wow! I didn't even think that the game had one. But it did! Surrealistic, strong, intense, romantic (Blondie, I love you baby). There are so many questions, some of them rhetorical, some won't be ever answered - Do you like hurting people?

,Recommended,219150,32582715,Posted: 19 June,all,SatanGoose,"Hotline Miami sets out to be a fast paced, top-down shooter with a great pixelated aesthetic, over the top gore, and an amazing soundtrack that will have you banging your head to the beat while shooting up bad guys. If that at all sounded appealing to you, get this game, because that is what this games sets out to do, and it achieves that perfectly. I know I used a bunch of words in that description (great, amazing, and perfect) that are all overused in reviews so much that they have all basically lost all meaning, but I couldn’t think of any other way to describe how impressed I am with with this game.Pros:StoryI’m not going to saymuchanything about it so I don’t spoil it, but I loved the story. A game like this doesn’t really even need a good story, just something to bring you from level to level, but this game went above and beyond.FeelI was going to put Art Style and Music in two separate categories, but couldn’t because of how well they complement each other to make both much better. The art style and music are the definition of “The whole is greater than the sum of its parts” They work so well together to create an amazing feel to the game that works so well with the gameplay and the story (which also work together to be greaterCore GameplayLike the rest of this game, it’s amazing. The controls are tight, the game makes you feel powerful, the scoring system is done well, anything you can think of is just good.High OctaneDo you like high octane games? Well good, because this is a high octane game. Now, I’m not entirely sure what “high octane” means, but I’ve heard alotof games described as high octane, and Hotline Miami is the embodiment of those games.FunThis game is really FUN. I had a blast playing it, and you probably will tooCons:ControlsThe controls took a little bit to get used to, specifically picking up and throwing weapons, but once I got used to it the problem was basically nonexistent. The only other problem I had with the controls was when selecting things in the menu, you use the arrow keys to change what you’re selecting, and then click with the mouse to choose it. It’s a bit weird, but it doesn’t really affect the game.LengthIt took me about 6 hours to play through the story, and the game is so great I wish it were much longer. Though, it does have masks and weapons to unlock, achievements to play for, and the levels are scored so it’s fun to try to beat your highscore, so it’s not too bad.I originally meant for this review to be like 3 lines, but this game is so amazing, once I started writing and thinking about how good it is, I couldn’t stop expanding on it. So yeah. Seriously, get this game."

,Recommended,219150,31826988,Posted: 18 May,all,Shadgam™,"The easiest way to describe Hotline Miami is that it’s the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ child caused by a coke fueled orgy between Groundhog Day and Scarface creating this incredible blood rush of a game.+Pros+Gameplay: Fast,brutal, and oh so satisfying. The combat largely revolves around striking fast and hitting hard with a variety of guns and melee weapons as it only takes one hit to kill your enemies but the same goes for you meaning that lives are short in this game but here comes the kicker. For the Groundhog Day element you’ll be respawning ridiculously fast so a level that may hold a lot of initial surprise with tons of killer enemies that may kick your♥♥♥♥♥at first will soon become child's play as through your infinite, multiple lives you’ll soon know exactly where every single enemy is, how they move, and what weapons they have meaning you’ll soon be doing some vicious combos in no time.+Soundtrack: A mix between soothing A E S T H E T I C music and blood pumping electronic beats that fits the mood when you need to slow down after the high and take in the strange story of Hotline Miami or when you take another drug hit and go on a massacre while the electro music blares in the background making you feel oh so good after bashing several dudes skulls in.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKD-MVfC9Ag&t=1368s+Artstyle: A lot of trippy visual effects and blood and gore galore making it a fun experience overall. As for gameplay purposes the sprites of enemies are easily identifiable and the weapons are all very visible meaning it shouldn’t be an issue for quick combat reactions.-Cons-/+Length: Very short game, I was able to beat the main campaign in about 2 hours. However, tons of replayability as levels will give you a grade based on factors such as time it took to you to beat the level and kill combos meaning there is replay value.-Difficulty: The game may start out fun and fast at first but later on it spikes in difficulty quite suddenly meaning it can be an annoyance to have the games speed slow down after getting such a blood rush from all the quick kills.-Story: The story can be a little unclear as a lot of the main characters actions are done after he receives a message on his answering machines as well as there being multiple characters manipulating him. However, the large question still remains which is are they real or are they a result of something else going on in the main character's head?  Regardless, the story will require a bit more looking into to understand.Final Verdict(8/10): Despite the minor complaints it doesn’t get in the way of the game just being a plain bloody good ole time with lots of drugs and killing. Worthy of buying at full price."
,Recommended,219150,27981495,"Posted: 28 November, 2016",all,Lady Zana,"""Do you like hurting other people?""Game overview*Genre: Action, top-down shooter, indie*Average length: ~6 hours*Developer: Dennaton Games*Publisher: Devolver Digital*Release date: October 23rd 2012*Platform: pc, ps3, ps4, vita<<< General features | pros & cons>>>+ Simple, yet addictive concept+ Many creative ways to success+ Unlockable masks+ Very rewarding and fun+ Amazing soundtrack+ - Frustration almost guaranteed- ?Full game review<<<Story introduction>>>Miami, 1989: meet 'Jacket', a guy living alone in his apartment whom gets various strange calls, each of which basically demand him to go to certain places and then assassinate everyone present. In order to anonymously execute these tasks, he wears animal shaped masks, the first of which he received in a package supposedly containing cookies. Following the phone caller's orders for a while, Jacket's reality eventually begins to fade, as he sees talking corpses and the like. Will he be able to keep acting out the incoming phone calls, or give into insanity as he keeps slaughtering countless people?<<<Gameplay, fun factor and replayability>>>The game's idea is very simple: you drive to various places, choose one of the many (unlockable) masks and get ready for a killing spree. How you tackle each mission is entirely up to you: do you want to use a big shotgun and blast 3 people to pieces simultaneously? Or would you rather use a little, yet very sharp knife - killing everyone before they see you as you sneak around? Or do you not care about any of that and just want to use raw power as you punch everyone in the face? It's all possible in this gory, action packed murder simulator!By completing missions and acquiring certain scores, you'll unlock more masks which modify your game in various small ways (e.g. start with a knife, more ammo etc). As levels get harder, it is not a bad idea to strategically pick a mask that'll greatly increase your chances of conquering each mission without too much trouble. Or, one could also act out the opposite - picking a mask that'll greatly increase the challenge of an already fairly difficult game.Yes, you did read that correctly: the game is difficult. But luckily not unfair. More so, this game is the perfect example that any challenge can be overcome by trial and error. You may fail the first 50 times, but once you figure out that one mission which seemed near impossible, you'll most likely be able to finish it way more quickly and creatively next time.As difficult as the game can be, it is just as rewarding (if not more) and fun, due to the many creative ways with which you can slaughter your enemies. It is also guaranteed to pump your body full of adrenaline, as this game is not really a relaxing one (well, that depends. For some, killing countless people may feel relaxing.You filthy sadist).If we look at the amount of replayability there is available, don't worry: there's a lot! To start, try getting an A+ score on all chapters. This alone will greatly increase your hours spent, as it gets more and more difficult to get this highest score in the later chapters. This game is also an amazing game for people who like speedrunning, as you get a higher score for completing a chapter more quickly. Lastly, and I said this already, there are so many creative ways in which you can complete a chapter, that you can just keep on playing and still have a very different experience compared to your  first playthrough.<<<Controls, graphics and sound>>>As far as the controls go; they are rather minimalistic and really easy to get used to. Running around is done with your familiar wasd, whereas shooting/picking up/dropping/throwing weapons is done with the mouse. Luckily, there is also a quick-restart button (the r key), which is going to become your best friend throughout this adventure.As this is an indie game, ofcourse the art style has to be unique, right? Lots of flashy colouring and effects to suit the crazy atmosphere of the game. Combined with the highly addictive soundtrack, you'll feel like you're on drugs 24/7 (you won't believe how cheap this drug is aswell, let alone on a -75% sale!)Mentioning the soundtrack ... Believe me when I say it is amazing. Especially Hydrogen gets me in that zone where I turn into a ruthless serial killer and laugh my♥♥♥♥♥off while chopping everyone's faces to pieces. This soundtrack, the art style and fast-paced gameplay go really well together and make for an incredibly fun overall experience.<<<The verdict>>>Look no further: everyone's favourite murder simulator is here! Therefore, recommended to everyone who is not afraid to partake in a journey full of trial and error, many creative ways to kill enemies and engaging in a crazy, over the top storyline! And most importantly ... the soundtrack is just too good to pass up!"

,Recommended,219150,30566677,Posted: 17 March,all,Rumpus,"Do you like hurting other people?This is the question that will haunt you throughout the bloodsoaked slaughter ofHotline Miami. Let me take the time to say that I think this is one of the best games I have ever played, and one of the most addictive. More addictive than CS:GO.Pixel Graphics Done RightThe first most notable aspect of Hotline Miami is the pixel graphics. It's done in a way that's drunk, tripping on acid and overdosing on painkillers all at once. Sounds disgusting. But it fits the story perfectly. The characters look like something out of an Adult Swim cartoon, minus the christ horrible dialogue and the pure ugliness. (Sorry ATHF.)Earworm Number OneBuy this ost. Just buy it. It's amazing. Nothing to say, just listen.GODDAMN SHOTGUNSAhhh... gameplay. Hotline Miami is a roguelike, and infamous for it's entire floor restarts on death. Death is also a one-hit kill, forcing players to not rush. That's not to say rushing is completely discouraged or restricted, as you are rewarded for time and brutal kills. Take for example one level, shaped like a sideways L. One enemy up the hall, 2 in nearby rooms. I can throw a weapon at the guy in front, rush the door on the left, steal and shoot a shotgun then wait for the other enemies to open the door into the barrel. Chaos. Those who also prefer a more masochistic path can utilize a lot of melee weapons. They're not very diverse stat-wise, but I still like to pick up certain things for the design of it, and the executions.So basically, when an enemy is down (by getting door rushed, punched or taking a weak bullet) they'll be KO'd for a couple seconds, giving you time to perform an absolutely nasty execution move. You know those Sky-Hook finishers from Infinite? Picture that, but it's mandatory, and there's more blood spewed on decap. You can grind someone to a pulp with a drill, smack their melon to pieces with a sledgehammer or even justbottle the♥♥♥♥♥♥Family-friendly violence!Who's behind that mask?Something that spices up gameplay even more is the variety of animal masks you can wear, which give special perks and abilities, such as Dennis the wolf mask, who starts with a knife, Brandon the panther (my personal favourite), who turns you into Sanic, and Willem, who rips out people's windpipes and steals their weapons.More complicated than the MatrixThat literally sums up this story. So, in a nutshell, you, le protagonist (who the fans refer to as ""Jacket"") has been receiving some nasty messages on his answering machine. He's told if he doesn't perform contract assassinations something bad will happen to him. Jacket has no idea of the kind of person he's up against, so he follows through.The strange thing is, everyone you are being sent to eliminate all have some things in common:They're all Russian. They're all mobsters. And they're all armed with weapons.Most locations are houses or hotels, but the level design gets progressively difficult and Jacket starts facing larger and more complicated rooms. You wake up one night, not even sure if it's night, to find 3 people all in animal masks sitting in chairs. The middle man, Richard (who is clad in a rooster mask) asks Jacket four questions:1. Do you like hurting other people?2. Who's leaving messages on your answering machine?3. Where are you right now?4. Why are we having this conversation right now?It's a very, very, VERY complex story.The Verdict?Hotline Miamiis a brutal run & gun RPG / TDS with a very confusing and hangover-induced story, driven (Right through a house) by disgusting yet beautiful graphics, and gameplay that'll really make you consider how much you like hurting people. Definite yes."

This game is one of my all time favorite indie games and it will stay that way for a long time. The mechanics for the game are interesting, the  dark story is hard to follow the first time playing through the game but later you'll really enjoy it. The sort of 80s retro soundtrack is really really fun, it gives the game feel a lot more of an atmospheric feel.Personally after beating the game 3 times, every once in a while I just jump in and have a bit of fun finishing some of my old favorite levels. The combat feels smooth, there is a wide variety of guns, melee and throwable weapons. Mechanics in the game are very awesome, you have different masks that each have their own powers, some are more useful than others and some just add extra challenge to experienced players. There are really only a few bad things I can say about this game, and those are listed below.Positives:+Super fun.+Fast paced combat.+Crazy gunplay.+Bloody and gory.+Lots of weapons.+Different masks each with their own skills.+Amazing pixel art graphics.+Good story.+Great sound effects and really nice retro soundtrack.+Each level has it's own sort of way, none of the levels are linear but there is always one objective, kill everyone.+Satisfying kills.+For some people (like me) replayability is very good.Negatives:-Game is pretty short, you can beat the game in around 5 hours.-Some major bugs which people use as exploits in levels, allowing you to beat the levels with ease.-Only 2 boss fights in the game, both quiet boring and easy, each take around 3 mins to beat.-Some really overpowered masks.-As much as the story is good, it's quiet linear, no backstory or anything on any of the character, we barley get any names.Both:-&+ AI is usually alright, but can sometimes be really broken and stupid.-&+Some levels use a different character that has different mechanics, some people like him but I don't really like him.-&+ Some masks that are funny, but are annoying to get and don't serve any really purpose other than a small joke.The fish mask that is a reference to Phil Fish, the maker of FEZ for example, all it does is turn all the text in the game into horribly butchered French.Overall I rate this game an8.5/10it does have it's flaws but it's still 100% worth picking up if you want a nice addition to your library and enjoy a challenge."

It rolls its eyes in your undying pleasure of exterminating humanity, not even for money, or for revenge, just for your own pleasure.How little you end up questioning your own actions during the course of the game is how it gets to you the deepest; it knows what you came for, and absolutely despises you for it.That's why you constantly get sidelined and your blood splattered across the carpet and tiles; it wants you dead as much as you want these faceless enemies to be.Gameplay is the most addicting part about it. Suckering you in like a drug dealer, to keep you coming back for more. And you do keep coming back for more.Even after literal thousands of deaths, you still end up coming back.The music places your entire mind into a completely different plane of existence for your murder spear. The art direction reflects nostalgia to disguise the horrifying actions you're committing. The story is entirely pointless, because if you don't care, why should the game?Coming back to that quote; ""questions are all I have for a man like you"", is a direct breaking of the forth wall to the people who play and have stuck with it for as long as they have...Even at it's worst, a forced stealth section, still holds meaning in some respects and can be quickly beaten once one realizes what to do with their surroundings.....I haven't played a game that has stuck with me in this way in years....If you haven't played it, take the ticket, and ride the ride.....""Do you like hurting people?""9/10"

I think without the music this would still be a great game, but with it it's hypnotically captivating when playing and inevitably replaying stages over and over, while you absolutely, positively, gotta kill every motherf*cker in the room (accept no substitutes) without dying.For the most part if you get hit once you die, so reflexes and timing are essential in making it through alive. Occasionally if a guy shoots you who is far away you might survive if he hits you in the arm, later on you get a mask that allows you  to take a hit before you die. In fact there are a ton of masks which you unlock that grant you special abilities, like being able to kill people with one punch, or that make the enemies unable to hear your gunshots if they are in another room (really useful).Later on the levels have 2 or 3 areas to clear, but if you die after clearing the first area you will restart at the beginning of the second area so you don’t have to restart the whole level over again, which could have become really tedious to the player.A few things that are annoying are  sometimes the enemies get stuck in doors or bug out and start spinning around in one spot. Also all the boss fights are really annoying, you will die (a lot).The story is interesting while also being kinda pretentious and ambiguous. The second game fixes some of this with more backstory and details into what may be going on. I don’t imagine that many people are playing through for the story though.If you enjoy good music or killing a metric f*ckton of bad guy pixels in increasingly gory ways,  then you should hit this up and imagine you’re Ryan Gosling in a chicken mask."

,Recommended,219150,29653720,Posted: 2 February,all,KT_Extinction,"Hotline Miami is one of my favorite indie games ever made.A perfect synthesis of design, aesthetic, audio, and atmosphere. Described simply, it is a series of difficult combat challenges that play out from a top down perspective, where you use close and long ranged weapons to dispatch your enemies as quickly and efficiently as you can. Described complexly, it is a cocaine fueled, pulse pounding, neon blasting, hazy fever dream of an experience that anyone who likes good music and fast paced, challenging gameplay should try out.Enemies all die in one hit, but so do you, so expect to die a lot. The “retry” button is bound to R, so expect to be pressing R as often as you do in an FPS to reload. There are different masks to unlock, which give you different abilities, and a weird, psychedelic surreal storyline to uncover.This game sits in my definition of a “Perfect Game” where all the mechanics, graphics, controls, and soundtrack come together impeccably, with every component in harmony and nothing contradicting each other. There is literally nothing wrong with the game.Actually no I lied, a small nitpick would be the enemies shooting you through glass panels on some later levels can get a bit tedious."
,Recommended,219150,31157341,Posted: 15 April,all,YaoiMeFloi,"If murder simulation is a genre, Hotline Miami is its new exemplar.The top-down action game coerces its players to take life in the quickest, ugliest and most ironic ways. It's caustic. It's filthy. It's one of the best arguments against casual violence in video games.All of Hotline Miami's bloodshed is bound in a pulpy crime story. A gang of animal mask-wearing criminals forces a street punk to become their assassin. They leave thinly veiled assassination assignments on his answering machine, sending him onto the streets of 1989 Miami.This isn't the story of a cold-blooded murderer. Guilt manifests itself mentally and physically. The world of Hotline Miami is dark as squid ink, and bolstered by a crunchy synth soundtrack and wavy neon graphics that combine to form an OK substitute for a bad LSD trip.The set dressing of the man's apartment is a particularly deft touch. The accumulation of trash and unexpected house guests establishes Hotline Miami's story more succinctly than would cutscenes or lengthy patches of dialogue. As his life goes, so goes his apartment.Killing — aggressive and violent — is the core of the game. The player can murder with a number of weapons, ranging from the traditional (pistols, machine guns) to the improvised (a pan full of boiling water). Points are rewarded and multiplied by stringing together assassinations and mixing up weapons. Earning the most points requires the player to do the most awful things, turning a high score into a symbol of how depravedly its players behave.Masks like those worn by your captors can be found or earned. Each grants a special ability — the owl mask makes hidden objects easier to find, for example, and the unicorn mask silences weapons. They are replay tools, most of which changed the way I approached a challenge. I found myself replaying missions to see how they handled with a certain buff or bonus weapon.Slamming a door into an unsuspecting enemy will stun them. You may then use the dazed goon as a hostage / living shield, the closest the game comes to a defensive maneuver. Defense rarely works. The ""hero"" is as vulnerable as his enemies, succumbing to a single strike.And so Hotline Miami is a mix of trial-and-error with run-and-gun. Test a strategy, die and apply what you learned. Never stop moving. You never feel safe; it turns you into a neurotic, mouse-smashing maniac. The second I died, I was hungry to start again. The repetition doesn't feel like a chore because of the quick retry system. Killing in Hotline Miami is more like a sport.'Murder is messy; you leave behind maimed corpses and Pollock-esque spatterings of blood. Bodies never disappear, a visual decision the developer underlines, bolds and highlights by making players hike through their destruction at the end of each stage.Playing Hotline Miami made me feel like an empowered homicidal maniac. I punched open the front door, knocked down the first guard, stole his knife and threw it into his colleague's neck. Before the second wave of guards could step out of the patrol room, I'd sliced them in half with a samurai sword stored in the maintenance closet. I ran into a bathroom, grabbed a man from the urinal mid-stream and tossed him to the floor, printing his face in the decorative tiles. Three guards approached the room, but they didn't know I'd trained a shotgun on the doorknob, just waiting for them to enter. And when they did...Non-violent encounters bookend missions in the world we know: The main character tries to go about his life — renting videos, visiting bars, grabbing pizza — but the dissonance is disorienting for the player and the character. It's refreshing to have a protagonist react believably to the absurdity and tragedy of his behavior.As the game approached its climax, I found myself asking, Why? Why is the world so inescapably violent and angry?Hotline Miami admirably does its best to provide an answer. You'll find it buried deep beneath the game's surface â figuratively and literally. It has more to say about our fascination with violence in games than the lion's share of its competition. That the killing is fun made me feel all the worse. Which was the point. Hotline Miami is exceptional not because it's violent, but because it's violent for a reason.All in all, Hotline Miami is, hands down, my favorite game i've played. I can't reccomend it enough to you."

If you dislike those kind of graphics, remember that the whole game is pixelated.- Very difficult. If you’re a person who is overall bad at games, or like specific game styles, remember that everything in the game is very, very, VERY difficult, unforgiving, and did I mentioned that it’s difficult? You will die all the time and I mean it.- Very fast-pasted. If you’re a casual gamer who enjoys gameplay that involves no stress at all, you should definitely reconsider buying this game.- No multiplayer.If none of the things I just mentioned don’t bother you, I would REALLY recommend you to play this game.Okay, now when that is out of the way, let’s talk about specific aspects.1. GameplayIt has a top-down perspective. (Look at the screenshots if you don’t understand.) Where you kill people with melees and guns. You can throw them, too, which is unique compared to most games that feature guns. Throwing the guns at a person resorts in knocking them down, and you execute them by pressing the space bar. If you have no melee equipped, you will need to left-click a few times before you kill the enemy. But if you wait a short while, the enemy will get up, equip the nearest weapon he can see, and will try to attack you again. There are enemies that require weapons, such as dogs, fat guys, and dodgers.Also, a very significant thing about the gameplay is that you get to choose a mask with different abilities. Want dogs not to attack you? Choose Ted. Want to make the enemies not hear the gunshots, and just kill them one-by-one? Choose Peter. Want to kill enemies just by throwing the guns? Choose Jake. You get the point.2. VisualsThey’re 24-bit, but they’re very detailed for a pixelated game (especially the faces that appear whilst dialogue). And if you’re a fan of gore in videogames, then you will definitely enjoy this game, considering that this is one of the goriest games that I’ve ever played. Okay, I’m not too much of a gamer, but my point is that the game is gory, especially in the second game.3. StorySorry, I can’t summarise the story chronologically in a few sentences, but it’s interesting, dark, mysterious, and confusing. Google search it if you want to. It won’t spoil anything, it’s hard to put the puzzle pieces together when playing the game. The first game has barely any story comparing to the sequel, and it constantly takes different roles and time periods.4. MusicIf you would ask anyone who has played Hotline Miami what stands out about this game, one of the first answers would be the music. It really gives you the atmosphere that the game takes place.

Offering extremely enjoyable combat with a selection of 34 diffrent weapons ranging from beer bottles and hammers to fully automatic rifles and a soundtrack that is all on it's own is worth the price of the game which you can check it out on theDevolver Digital official Soundcloudor find right in the game directory. On top of everything the story is very well written based on what I've come to expect from an indie title that isn't 100% focused on it. You can pick it up for as low a an American dollar during a sale and it's without a doubt worth much more than that.

A great 80s style music makes this game even much more enjoyable to play. I highly recommend you buy the soundtrack cause the developers deserve it for making an amazing soundtrack.Gameplay: This game is straight up difficult. You need to have fast reaction times since enemies move really fast and attack you quickly. Your objective is to eliminate all the enemies on each floor to complete the level. All enemies die in one shot, but the twist is that you are the same exact way! Before each level you get to choose a mask that will give you different abilities and each level has certain masks that are well suited for each other. Not to mention this game is violent, ya its all pixelated but the kill animations makes this really violent.Story: The story for this game is really dark and interesting. You are a no-named character that is getting phone calls that essentially leads him to killing off the russian mob. While doing so you see this hallucinations of 3 characters that question who you are and if what your doing is worth it kinda of thing... In the end if you sit back and look at how the story is going, its really interesting and a good way of storytelling IMO.Conclusion: Hotline Miami (as well as its sequal) is one of the best Indie games out there. The gameplay is very tense and a lot of fun. And the soundtrack will be one that you will listen too for a while and eventually will play in your car lol.Rating: 10/10"

I may not have enjoyed it nearly as much as everyone else, perhaps on account of the original hype setting expectations rather high resulting in being somewhat underwhelmed. Regardless Hotline Miami makes for a good time. Gameplay is a solid, fast-paced top-down action shooter including tactical stealth elements, with plenty of violence and difficulty to boot. I really would recommend buying if you haven't already."
,Recommended,219150,23418628,"Posted: 6 June, 2016",all,h_412,"Like a whirlwind of colour, music and blood, Hotline Miami sucks you in, spins you around then spits you back out, leaving you dazed and bewildered but certain that you want to jump right back in.The gameplay is all brutal combat and quick reflexes, fuelled by a pulsing electronic soundtrack. 99% of the time one hit from the hordes of enemies will kill you and at times the games becomes almost like a puzzler, figuring out the exact timing, sequence and weapon choice required to kill the next room of enemies. You will die, sometimes over and over, but the level can be restarted with no loading time, encouraging experimentation - further emphasised by the numerous masks you can wear, each of which bestows a distinct and powerful ability on the character. It can certainly get frustrating sometimes but it rarely felt excessive. The game is definitely hard but it never feels impossible.The story is a stange beast. You are told to kill so you kill: to play the game, to progress, to find out just what the heck is happening. Much of the game and its setting is hidden in subtext and implied by the world, so much so that at times the story can feel unsatisfactory, but when you reflect on the game and play it through again you begin to see that the most important things are those left unsaid, that you have to interpret and understand in your own way. Rest assured, the more thought you put into the world and the very specific, sometimes apparently meaningless, things people say, the more any seeming lack of story disappears.The game also has plenty of replayability, to understand for one but also to try new strategies, beat your score, blast through levels that one had you stuck, find every weapon, perform every bloody execution possible and all while listening to a soundtrack that only gets better the more you hear it. It feels positively good inside to finally get an A+ rating of levels you previously struggled to get a C- on.In short, Hotline Miami is an experience, and an incredible one at that. I adore this game and have no hesitation labelling it a must-play. Buy it, play it and, most important, think about it."

,Recommended,219150,24742672,"Posted: 6 August, 2016",all,_BillCipher | ScrapTF,"To Put it ShortMan, Hotline Miami. How I wish I had played such an amazing game earlier. This violent beauty has been out since late 2012 and sadly I finally first picked it up during the Steam Summer Sale. And now, 33 hours later, I finished it getting every achievement, ready for Hotline Miami 2, which I also bought in the Sale. Hotline Miami is the perfect mix of strategy and brute force to get to your goal. In each level, you are presented with a building full of enemies. You must kill everyone on that floor to progress, and you beat the chapter by killing everyone on every floor. There are a wide range of weapons for both you - Jacket - and the enemy - Russians. Golf Clubs, Shotguns, SMGs, Bats, Knives, Shurikens, just to name a few. Hell, you can even throw scissors at an enemy and it'll kill them.More In DepthHotline Miami's combat is something I truely love, and is not easy to replicate. The player cannot withstand hundreds upon hundreds of bulletsSOMEvideo game characters (I'm looking at you, Heavy Weapons Guy.). One shot by a gun, one swing of a bat and you need to restart. Even though you are given checkpoints on every floor, this doesn't stop you from dying any less. My 'r' key has been used significantly more since I started needing it every time I die. Damn shotguns. Now, as you would expect from many modern shooters, shooting isn't all there is to Hotline Miami. Here are some of the things you have during combat:A balance between melee weapons and guns. Will I need my metal pipe? Will I need my SMG? That's for you to decide, thanks to the range of weapons laid out.Masks. So many masks! When you arrive at the start of a chapter, you may choose a 'mask' to wear. Each mask shows an animal, and it has an effect on the player. The mask 'Dennis' gives you a knife at the start of the chapter. The mask Graham makes the player faster. The mask Brandon makes the player even FASTER! And these are just a few. There are 26 masks in the PC release, and each has it's own special ability, so you can choose what you want to help you. Now, these aren't just given to you. You get most masks as rewards for completing a level with a high score. This gives you something to work towards, pushes you to do your best in a level.A story. But not just any story, an interesting story. Many recent games have failed to interest me with their story all that much (Prime examples - Five Nights at Freddy's, Undertale). Hotline Miami's story, however, is definitely very interesting. I don't want to try and explain the story now, it's something you should experience yourself, however I personally love it. Most of the time, throughout the game, you'll get little parts of story before and after each chapter. The game is split into 'parts', and at the start of these 'parts', you usually get more story too. This made me keep playing, by far. If I was to get stuck on a level, I'd carry on because I want to know what'll happen in the story. This determination has brought me all the way through the game, and I'm pretty sure it's going to get me through Hotline Miami 2, too.Variation. A lot of games don't care that much for variation. This one, however, rewards you for it. Now, every kill you get rewards you a set of points. These are added up at the end of the game, and bonuses are added depending on things you've done, and then you are presented with a rank (A+, A, B, C, etc). You may be thinking, 'how does this encourage variation?', well, I'll explain that too. One of these bonuses you can get is 'flexibility'. Here's a good example of this; Imagine I'm in a room with three enemies, and I have a shotgun. I could easily just shoot all of them, and get the points for kills. If I want flexibility points, however, I could shoot one, grab his weapon, kill another with that, throw the weapon at the last guy and then execute him. This adds variation to your playstyle, and will reward you for doing so. 'Why do I care about points though?' You ask?Weapons are not just 'there', like in some games. There are a set of weapons that will appear in the game to start off with. After every level, your points are put towards unlocking a new weapon. This then carries on until you meet the goal of unlocking a weapon, and then to the next weapon. If I need 60000 points to unlock the UZI SMG, for example, and I get 30000 points in one chapter and then 30000 in another, these will add together and the SMG will unlock. Once unlocked, the weapon will now be able to spawn in any chapter randomly. This means that to get a good weapon, you need to work hard in earlier levels. Some of these weapons can be really helpful, like the silenced pistol.The. Soundtrack. Man, the soundtrack. Honestly, it's worth the extra £6.99. Any review you read will tell you this, so I won't stay on it, but DAMN, the soundtrack in this game is ♥♥♥♥ing amazing.Now, every good game comes with it's flaws, it isn't easy to find a game with nothing bad about it, and HM is no exception. The problem is, the flaws in HM are either minor or common, so there is little use listing or complaining about them. Instead, I'd like to say this: Hotline Miami isn't a perfect game, but if you're into it's gameplay, music and style, it damn sure comes close to one. You have to decide what is good and bad about it yourself.All in All -Hotline Miami is one of my favourite games of all time, without question. However, it isn't for everyone. If you aren't into extreme violence, hidden plot, actually needing to focus and/or spending a lot of time to complete a game, I wouldn't recommend this to you. Otherwise, knock yourself out, this truely is a well made title.Enjoy this review?

With a clever story and intense gameplay you will drool as you see all your victims lie on the ground dead. Objective? KILL EVERYONEStory: Game as a very clever plot if you dig in. I will tell you a bit of the story, you play as an unnamed protagonist (dubbed ""Jacket"") who starts getting unknown phone calls that are basically telling him to go to locations and kill Russian mobsters/mafia. As you continue to kill you start losing insanity trying to make out what is real or not. This is as much info as I will tell you. But the backstory and secrets will shock you to the core.Gameplay: This is a fast paced game. If you can't react fast or think fast then this isn't a game for you. In this game you wear masks to aid you when killing people, they can either boost your speed, assist you with guns or even gain you more points. The executions are brutal where you smash heads and stab people, this game is not for the faint hearted! The enemies react and attempt to kill you on sight but they aren't smart. Melee enemies are easy to take out since your fists are enough to get the dropped weapon and enemies with gun are a challenge but I think you can manage that. Overall fast and fun gameplayArt: The art is nice and decent. The art is simple and not to pretty. The sprites for main characters are nicely made and simple, the russian mobsters sprites have one same look (they are all bald). The level design are simple design but there are some good designs and colours. But the face portrait for when the characters are talking are well done! And lets not forget about the blood. This game has a habit of being really messy and bloody and I really like that. YOU CAN SEE HUMAN BRAINS THEY ARE SO REAL 76/10! But the design alright its not good looking but I like it that way!Music: Has to be one of the best soundtracks I have heard in a video game. The music fits in well with each level I play and I can really feel the rush. Some are intense, some a good to dance to and some a great for relaxing after slaughting your enemies. There isn't any rock or pop its club or DJ music. I really enjoyed listening to the music and you will too.Negative: One thing that I will say this... what you are doing is so evil and bad that its not funny. And I am saying that for people who are thinking of getting this game cause I love bloody games with blood and gore.Conclusion: This wasn't a long review but decent review. For two developers this is really impressive. But if you are really thinking of getting this game then you should buy this without thinking. This game deserves $10!

People rave about the soundtrack from Hotline Miami but I didn't see what all the fuss was about.What really kept me coming back for more was the addictive game play, you will die, ALOT. What makes this all the more bareable is the quick restart times, you don't have to sit through masses of text just to continue playing, you are just thrown back in at the last check-point, which usually is the start of the floor you are on.Levels can last anywhere between two minutes, right up to fiften minutes due to trial and error runs until you pretty much get the perfect run. Your aim is to take out the bad guys while also remaining alive, you die instantly as soon as you are hit and depending on how you hit a bad guy, can sometimes take a few hits.I would highly recommend this gam as one you play a couple of minutes of every now and again, I can't imagine it being the sort of game where you blast through it in a few sessions, but I really enjoyed my time on Hotline."

Maybe it's the ugly pig mask or the 80s style frat boy holding a nearly naked woman in one arm with a bloody axe in the other.The grainy graphics combined with the high speed of game play can offend a first-time player too. It takes a little while to get over it. The constant screen movement is also likely to make some players nausious, and there is no way to disable it.While relatively short, Hotline Miami has great music, entertaining game play, lots of grainy pixalated blood splattering gore, secrets to find, and an interesting background story.The story itself can be difficult to figure out, because the game is initially played from the perspective of a man with some serious mental issues, along with some apparent gunshot induced brain damage. But a story is there, and it is interesting. But without the puzzle password, you won't be able to see it.The USA in the later 1980s was a time of leadded gas, black monday, crack cocaine, irrational fear of AIDs, homophobia, the cold war, russian invasion, star wars, mohawks, the satanic panic, child sex-abuse hysteria, and an offensive overuse of neon colors.  This game is pratically a time travel machine.It was all really quite tramatic.  No wonder the 90s are remembered fondly, given the backdrop of the 60s-70s hangover period that was the 80s.You too can relive the late 1980s in the US, along with smashing people's heads with an iron pipe, by simply playing this game.If you are born after 1996 and wonder why everyone older than you seems brain damaged, just remember: tetraethyl lead.I mentioned that the music was good, right?"

I've played it on the PC but never could quite get into the control scheme the way I could for the Vita. I enjoyed the heck out of this bloody puzzle/action/homicidal maniac/mind screw simulator. Although I have to say in honesty that I believe that it makes a better small platform/mobile type game than a sit down pc game. I would play it on any platform if I could if I hadn't had access to the Vita version.  That could be just the thousands of bats, crowbars, knives, swords, and bullets to the head talking.If you aren't turned off by the suprisingly gory graphics for such a retro? style (are these retro graphics or just highly stylized?) its a game that is both simplistic and highly sophisticated. It is CRAZY the amount of violence that is conveyed through what are relatively simple graphics.Hell, it kept me up for ""one more level"" until 2:30 when I had to be up for work at 5:30. I'd certainly recommend it."

It has a 2D 8-bit graphic and crazy colours that make it feel like you're on drugs the entire time. The music makes you feel like being in trance... But when I finally bought the game, I really enjoyed it!You play as some guy who lives in Miami in 1989 and constantly gets wierd phone calls, which tell him to go to various places and do... things. You put on your creepy animal mask, bust through a door and start brutally murdering EVERYONE you meet!! That's basically what you do throughout the entire game and, suprisingly, it never gets boring! The gameplay is never the same, since the enemies always behave in different ways, sometimes even kinda unfair. :( The game can be pretty frustrating at times, because you die after a single hit, but not just you, also your enemies!

The soundtrack ties in pretty well too.  If you are more of a completionist, you will put a lot of time into this to get those A+ scores.

But uhh, what's not to love about that?! The game might seem a bit repetitive... Just kidding, you have more than a dozen of masks to choose from, each mask delivers a special ability that allows you to approach the same scene in a different way. Not to mention the score.... Who the hell does not LOVE to beat his friend's score and shove it in his face the next day. Moreover, there's a list of weapons and multi-kickass ground hits ( Depending on the melee you're slaughtering with.).

,Recommended,219150,13701366,"Posted: 29 December, 2014",all,fenster,"Hotline Miami is a classic example that you shouldn’t judge a game by its cover.  First impressions from screenshots and videos may leave you thinking of it as a run of the mill, top-down shooter where you blast baddies with guns (with some ultra-violence mixed in); end of story.  But if you aren’t familiar with what it actuallyis, as I was not, then the reality is that Hotline Miami is something much more thrilling, intricate, and insightful than what your initial impression probably suggests.  Not only is the action unique and fast paced, it is all accented with an outstanding soundtrack and surprisingly smart narrative in this stellar game by Devolver Digital.Hotline Miami has you playing in late 1980's Miami, controlling a character who receives phone calls from a mysterious antagonist of sorts.  Each phone call provides you with a target to assassinate, who is usually tucked away in a building behind all manner of bodyguards and thugs. Typically you start the level with no more than your fists, but you can steal melee weapons and guns from bad guys to unleash carnage more efficiently.  As more missions are completed, newer masks (which can grant you passive buffs) are unlocked, as well as new weapons.The brilliant twist in Hotline Miami is that enemies move and react at a breakneck pace, and your character dies in a single shot or melee hit.  The result is that many levels will have you dying dozens of times if you want to run the level efficiently and with a good score -- thankfully Hotline Miami spends virtually zero time between your death and the start of your next run.  Clearing a level feels like a perfectly orchestrated heist of brutality and cunning.  It’s very similar to something like Super Meat Boy in that regard, but the gameplay itself is different in a very refreshing and unique way.In most top-down shooters, you wouldn't expect much in the way of narrative.  Hotline Miami doesn't have a stand-out narrative and it’s certainly not the focus here, but I was impressed with the way Devolver Digital used small environmental changes to make large implications to the player.  These small breadcrumbs build up to a pretty compelling plot; I found myself attached to a character who speaks virtually no dialogue.  It helps that the mood is set so perfectly in Hotline Miami; the music is absolutely perfect for every scene (and amazing on its own as well), and the gritty, colorful graphics create a very realized setting for the action taking place.One thing worth mentioning is that Hotline Miami is an insanely brutal and violent game.   It’s intentionally over the top and discomforting, and frequently your hand will be forced to perform some gratuitous acts against questionably innocent people without reason.  What’s unexpected is that HM makes some extraordinary comments on violence in games for those who follow the relatively abstract story.  For those interested who have beat the game (or don’t mind some spoilers), I would highly recommend reading Rami Ismail’s excellent article on Gamasutra entitled “Why Hotline Miami is an Important Game.”That said, you don’t really need to care about the underlying message to enjoy Hotline Miami.  It is a rollercoaster of high-octane, violence fueled fun, with some commentary if you care enough about it.  The length and difficulty are just right, and it’s hard not to have a smile on your face as you slowly put together your perfect, bloody infiltration to the fantastic soundtrack.  Truly, Hotline Miami is one of the most complete and enjoyable games you can play on PC today -- check it out."

You're a loner fighting everyone else.Because of this, the masks you either unlock by having a highscore or finding them yourself in levels give you some abilities (or messy, funny perks, such as reversing your controls and translating everything to french.)You are also able to knock enemies with doors or execute them with your weapons or your fists, something that enemies can't do.This is why Hotline Miami is outstanding.You are just someone else, and not an OP character like in a lot of action games you will find.The soundtrack is also extremelly great, even a friend of mine said in plug.dj that it's better than sex, hahah. I'm pretty sure you will enjoy this game, if you want more, the second part includes a level editor with workshop support.By the way, if you're australian, the developers are willing to send you a free copy of the second game if you prove you're a real citizen.So, what else do you want me to tell you?The graphics don't matter, you will never be trying to pay attention to it, it's everything else where it's at.I would suggest to use only the Richard mask if you're actually playing instead of messing around, if not, don't use Tony, he's op, he's better for trying to achieve S runs."

The only thing I don't like in this game are the Fatties, those ennemies that die few seconds after being hit by a gun, same goes with the dogs that I can't punch to death, such a shame. The fatties also don't die by any kind of melee. I also don't like those Chuck Norris ennemies that spot you and kill faster than you can say Hey!

It's an amazing game with a dropdead sexy soundtrack that sends a love letter to 80's nostalgia and gets a return letter with a big fat ol kissy face on it.The story is going to be incredibly vague, and often times you will not be able to immediately understand it. In fact in the beginning, you're going to think it drags on and is repetitive, but this game's combat is way more than enough for me to say, nothing in this game will get repetitive as long as you give it a whirl, you'll just want to play other games some days, that's about it. You play as this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ psycho badass who goes to buildings and clears them all out of life, and you get graded based on how stylish and effective your kills were. You can beat the ♥♥♥♥ out ♥♥♥♥♥shit ♥♥♥♥♥s with a crowbar, bat, blow their damn head off with a shotgun, watch their guts fly out with a machine gun, and at first it'll seem simple but the level design is clever and keeps you coming back forever. It's a classic, baby. A masterpiece.After all is said and done gameplay wise, you hop back in your car and drive off to get ready for the next mission,the story slowly unraveling itself to you, sometimes with more question than answers.You'll love the style,you're going to have fun,don't hesitate, especially if this game is on a sale.Buy it now.

,Recommended,219150,14710245,"Posted: 1 March, 2015",all,Snort Cannon,After a while i decided to re write my review to one of my favorite games of all time because my original review didn't do service to this game. So lets begin shall we ? Hotline Miami is a top down shooter set in an alternative timeline Miami. The city is overrun by russian mafia men who deal crime all over the city and that's where you come in. We play as Jacket a mysterious man who lives alone in an aparment and gets mysterious phone calls which give out an adress. Filled with rage we go there and massacre anyone that is inside. After a while we start to doubt whats real and whats not because the game starts to mess with you. So how is Hotline Miami ? It's one of the best games i have played in my entire life and if you haven't played this game by now what the hell are you doing reading this review ? Go get the game right away and expierence this masterpiece. Hotline Miami is a top down fast paced shooter where a single mistake will cost you your life. One hit kill deaths and you have to repeat the same floor again. The game is never not unfair because every time you die is because of a single mistake you make. The game is rather fast paced so you definetly need to move fast if you want to survive. The game also looks amazing. The neon colors look great and the level desing is also fantastic. The game is a blast to play and after a while you start to feel great after the kills. You could say this game unleashes the psycho inside you. The soundtrack is one of the best soundtracks in video game history. Overall theres nothing bad to say about Hotline Miami there are some minor bugs but nothing major. You need to play this without a doubt cause this is one of the best games ever made. I give Hotline Miami a 10/10For more reviews follow Snort's Review curator pagehere- follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!

The game is not for everybody though, it's aimed mainly towards an audience that likes mysterious plots, extreme challenge, simplicity, and people who enjoy violence.

Set in 1989 Miami, the plot consists of two protagonists, Jacket and Biker, who have been receiving phone calls instructing them to commit massacres against the local Russian Mafia. The game blends top down perspective with stealth, extreme violence and surreal storytelling, along with a soundtrack and visuals influenced by 1980s culture.Hotline Miami is divided into several chapters, each of which is further broken down into several stages. At the start of most chapters, the unnamed protagonist wakes up in his apartment and listens to cryptic messages on his answering machine. These messages tell him to perform an arbitrary task at a certain location, which in each case is inferred as a metaphor for killing every person at that location, such as giving VIPs at a hotel a 'great stay', or taking care of a 'pest infestation'. Prior to commencing a mission, the player is asked to select an animal mask to wear, each of which provides unique advantages or handicaps.Strong points+ Great soundtrack+ Great price for what it offers+ Retro+ Difficulty+ Satisfactorily+ Steam Trading CardsWeak points- Very short storyRating9/10"

Several friends playing it and it being recommended by one of them eventually made me play it regardless.Since I am not really the best when it comes to games that require fast reaction time or reacting to enemies from different angles without simply shooting the wall instead, I didn't think it would be the right game for me.However, playing it made me think otherwise: It has a unique gameplay and some kind of flair as well as a great story which I didn't even expect to exist in the first place. The game was challenging for me, yes. Heck, it even got frustrating at some parts where I seriously got stuck for one or once even two hours on a single stage. But at least it feels like a game that requires serious skill for once. And finally making it to the end of a level after you have struggled for hours feels extremely satisfying (unless you oversee the last person and get shot in the face, lol rip).In conclusion, if you are into Arcade Shooters, it is a must buy. If you are the average Joe that looks for a unique and catchy gameplay, buy it.

Publishers in the gaming industry are fully aware that their most dependable demographic is the larger part of what must be the whimpiest, most uncreative, and, disproportionate to their accomplishments, the most self-entitled and uncaring generation in mankind’s brief but hardy existence. What is said of the consumer is also true of the industry.An anthropologist could draw parallels in the gaming industry to Natural Selection. Studios, now more than ever on account of economic turmoil, are foregoing innovation lest they risk fiscal disaster. In recent times we have witnessed a number of studios and even publishers declare bankruptcy and some very popular franchises have inexplicably gone extinct. Survival of the fittest does not imply that the surviving species is superior in the way that make sense to us. Tyrannosaurus Rex is gone but the world is abound in roaches. Just remember that one of THQ's last works before filing for bankruptcy was Saints Row the Third.The industry is getting increasingly slimy with its customers – hardly a title comes out, anymore, that doesn't push the envelope in terms of false advertising, that doesn't include “Day 1 DLC” and even, astonishingly, pre-determined and untested “Day 1 Patches”… As a consequence to these issues found in the economy, consumer, and industry - challenging and fresh games from creative publishers that actually do what they advertise, do it correctly, and haven’t been parceled out by a greedy publisher for piece-by-piece consumption are few and far between.If what you like are annual sequels to sports games with minuscule engine adjustments, or linear shooters that recycle materials from many years past and phone-in single player campaigns for a robust but largely unchanged multiplayer that is incomplete without expansions that effectively triple or quadruple the advertised sticker price, there’s nothing wrong with you. It is okay to like those things. But for those who I teasingly call “refined in taste,” there has been a recent boom in really awesome indie games that are nothing like the mainstream.Here’s one of them. It’s called Hotline Miami.One reviewer on Steam stated very simply that Hotline Miami “saved the gaming industry” - in that vein, I was very tempted at first to write facetiously that “Hotline Miami is to gaming what Citizen Kane is to film” and end it there. But then I realized what I intended to advance with mirth was closer to truth than fiction. Hotline Miami, a vibrant colored top-down pixel shooter with a brilliant 80’s synth soundtrack and ironic gore, is closer to being the Citizen Kane of gaming than the current editions of Call Of Duty’s or Battlefield’s or NBA’s or Madden’s are to even being remembered for their individual qualities a few years from now. Twenty years from now, Hotline Miami will still be noteworthy in gaming history for its value, for its unforgiving difficulty, for its attractive style... and, I suppose... for asking the player “Do you like to hurt people?” moments before giving him the chance to powerdrill the heads of dining patrons while wearing a grasshopper mask.You’ve probably invested hundreds, perhaps thousands of dollars to keep up to date with your favorite shooter or sports franchise. There's truly nothing wrong with you investing in what makes you happy. But treat yourself by giving Hotline Miami a chance. For only a couple of dollars, you can experience one of the greatest games of your generation."

,Recommended,219150,809924,"Posted: 20 February, 2013",all,King Grimroc,"9/10If Michael Mann and David Lynch decided to say screw the movie business, and both decided to collaberate on a small indie game together, it would probably be a little something like Hotline Miami. Mann setting up the intense soundtrack and gritty locales with over the top violence. Lynch setting up a story that is only intended to mess with out heads and leaving us saying ""WHAT THE ♥♥♥♥?"" as we go further down the rabbit hole. Nothing is what it seems after all. What seems like a standard game where you play hitman to a faceless voice on a phone, quickly turns into something else, albeit, cryptic along the way. I won't say anything else on that. Just know that this game has all of the right elements going for it.Hotline Miami is a top down game that mixes melee, shooting, and stealth mechanics, with 1 hit kill or be killed gameplay, to make one hell of a tense game. It is hard. Very hard. You will die a LOT. I have not had this much fun dying since I played Dark Souls. This may unfortunately turn off those looking for an easier type of game.Throughout the game, you will come across many thugs, and in each section, the goal is simple. Kill everyone. You will use pretty much everything around you to do so. Play enemies into the environment by doing some rope a dopes. Use stealth tactics, to silently kill enemies. Or go balls to the wall guns blazing on a room full of baddies. There is no pre-determined way to reach your goal in each section. And each time you die, you may have to re-strategize completely.The game can be overly frustrating for some people for 2 main reasons. the difficulty being the main issue for some people. If you get shot, or melee hit just 1 time, you're done. And the action is so fast and frentic you will have little time to dodge hits. Enemies are quick, and they do not hesitate. There is no real adaptive AI in them. If they hear a gunshot, the come running. If they see you, they shoot (and they are almost 100% accurate on the spot you are (or hopefully were) standing in. So while the enemies may not be adaptive, you will need to be instead. And that is the key to getting through unscathed. And it will take being unscathed to achieve that. The other issue that may tick people off is one flaw in the otherwise decent lock on system. It locks on to the closest enemy (unless you manually move the cursor). Why is this bad? Because it will lock onto enemies in other rooms! If a guy is coming down a corridor that you in, and you want to lock onto him, and there is another guy in a room next to you with the doors closed, and he happens to be closer, well, you guessed it. the guy who is not a current threat will be auto targeted. Kind of annoying. But not game breaking. With the manual cursor movement for camera panning, this is easily fixed.Visually Hotline Miami is pretty damn nice for a heavily pixeled retro style top down shooter. The action takes place primarily inside buildings ranging from seedy motels, night clubs, to office buildings and more. When enemies die (or you do), the blood splatter and gore is super satisfying. You'll see severed limbs, exploded heads, decapitations, brain matter, and more all over the place as you leave a trail of bodies in your wake on your missions.As for the music, the reason I bought the game, well, just listen for yourself:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKD-MVfC9AgBuy this game now!"

This can be done using dialogue, information present in your surroundings, content found while playing the game and the narrative arc.  The second way is with its aesthetic.  Things like your surroundings, character design, art design, and environment art.  The third, and arguably the most difficult, is to make a statement with gameplay, where your act of interaction is a position of artistic merit.  The reason I would say that using the gameplay as a pertinent tool for a message is difficult since controls are either so seamless, or so boilerplate, that it is simply relegated as a system of input.  The first game to use all three competently this year was Spec Ops: The Line.  With Hotline Miami, there are now two.  The storyline strongly evokes David Lynch or Cronenberg.  The aesthetics feel like an 80s Michael Mann film, and the gameplay is like an acid trip Manhunt.  Must play."

I haven't completed the game yet, but I'm already on level 11 and it's one of the coolest things I've ever played. Beautiful pixel graphics (no matter how absurd that sounds), amazing and at the same time very complex (and hardly understandable) plot, and the gameplay is just awesome. The game is definitely not one of ""press x to win"" kind, and that's yet another advantage of it. Love it."

Despite I'm not a fan of excessive violence , I absolutely loved that game , for various reasons .First thing first , the gameplay . The most important part of anygame . Here it's simple : View from above , mouse to aim and shoot , key to move . Simple ? Not really , because the game is EXTREMELY difficult - even a bit Try'n'die at some moments (at my third hour of playing , I had 901 deaths . Duh .) It's up to you to choose wether to go full melee and try not to be spotted or to go loud - which is ultra dangerous , though rewarding in term of combos if you manage to kill many ennemies quickly . Note that the weapons have extremely limited ammo - 6 shotgun bursts and you have to drop it , for exemple . There are also various element that might surprise you : windows through you can shoot -and mostly get shot- , events , etc . Any stage has it difficulties , but to make the thing more diversified , there are a lot of mask with different effects on the gameplay : One will make door stomping fatal to ennemies , one will give you more ammo ... It's up to you to discover .Second thing , the scenario and ambiance . It's like a psychological thriller happening in Miami , covered in shadows from the very begining , and staying obscure even though it brightens over the time . The more the game progress and the more ... Well , I'm not gonna spoil , but it's worth a try . This kind of scenery in a place like 80's Miami feels quite disturbing - though unique in a certain way .Third thing that diserves to be noted is the amazing OST . No less than 9 artists composed the tracks of the game , mostly 80's techno and some few tracks of psychedelic music . And it's just a pleasure for the ears that manages to fit with the bloodbathes you're going to generate .There's a lot of secrets to unlock , different ways to finish the mission depending the mask you take , and the score system will might you try even harder to do the perfect run . So in term of replayability , the game is good .To make short : Don't hesitate , buy it ."

Not always but it seems like they do it too often. Who knew Russians were psychic?But all in all, a great challenge,  good music, and a ton of masks to fit any playing style.

,Recommended,219150,24867763,"Posted: 12 August, 2016",all,𝓙immidy𝓙im𝓙am,"Hotline Miami is a top down 80s styled shooter but it is so much more than that. For you to progress in this game you will need to be quick and have fast reflexes to kill enemies before they kill you but at the same time it is manditory to strategically plan your way through the level meaning it's a game requiring both thought and skill. As for the enemies your only advantage over them is that you have the magical power to ""press R to restart"" (which you will use to your advantage quite a lot, trust me) because your health is equal to them, you can die in one shot, they can die in one shot, which leads to one of the most prominent features of the game; it's difficulty. If you are a casual gamer not up for a challenge this game is probably not for you, but if you're up for a challenge playing through this game is really rewarding. Killing enemies will result in a satisfying display of blood and gore and exploring through the levels looking for secrets (masks and letters for the secret password) will also keep you occupied. Regarding the story, as for the most part it is pretty dull until the major revelation at the true ending which I found to be pretty cool but otherwise I think the story is a bit overrated in this particular game. The story element gets expanded upon much more in the second instalment but as an Australian it is not possible for me to legally purchase Hotline Miami 2: Wrong Number as it is banned here. :(Edit: Managed to buy Hotline Miami 2 while overseas.

Also, it's in the 1989.Mask system and soundtrackThis game features a unique mechanysm called ""mask system"", winch just bases on having animal mask that give You benefits like Good Shot (Rick), An Eye for Secrets (Rasmus), Start with drill (Carl). Game has a cool, oldschool vibe, packed with pixels, neon lights, and...THE AMAZING SOUNDTRACK. It just goes perfect with the killing spree. Love the music? Proably love the game, since..beats, but well, some people I saw can't really beat it.Why Hotline Miami?The game IS about dying alot, so don't think it'll be a painful thing, You don't need to wait, just press R to restart. Don't worry also about people saying that ""game is too hard"". It's their fault they can't really beat it. Anyway, You have a very big variety of strategies to choose, this is why the fun never ends!The real problemProblem is: The game is too short. 2 days at max. Hotline Miami also features a very nice, smooth lore and multiple endings, but they don't base really on your decisions, just has two perspectives including the puzzle, but won't spoil you anymore.Pros:- Great theme;- Mask system;- Perfect soundtrack;- Lore;- Brutality;- Variety of killing options, strategies.One medium thing:- Can be hard for some people, but I honestly think it's their fault they can't play the game; either it's that it's not their type of game, or, they get tired after trying alot so they don't want to continue.Cons:- Very short (2 days to beat in my playthrough).Overall:10/10 - Just buy it!EDIT: I made this review bigger, so people can find this more useful (maybe)."

,Recommended,219150,10230473,"Posted: 25 May, 2014",all,Schleem,"One of my favorite games in my steam library.I played this for about 30 hours and I'm completely DONE with it, I collected all masks, got A+ on each chapter, found all puzzle pieces and played the alternate ending. So yes, this is a short game, considering I played it for the lenght of a normal game's campaign, except I did EVERYTHING you could possibly achieve.The goodThe gunplay and melee combat is amazing, you need tactics and fast reflexes to brutally murder your way through each level.Even though you might consider the gameplay repetitive, it doesn't feel like that, because each room, each floor is a new challenge on its own. Gunshots attract enemies, so you have to decide whether or not you want to alert the whole floor, all because you want to shoot some idiot, who has his back turned on you anyway.This game is gameplay-focused, and barely has a story, but this isn't a bad thing, because the gameplay is just so ridiculously fun.There is an alternate ending, which explains a 'story' behind it, but by the time you've found the way to unlock it, you don't care about the story anyways.The music makes the gameplay much more fun, It makes you not give up when you've been killed by that same damn dog for the 60th time.The badThere isn't much bad things about this game, you might say the graphics, but I never found the pixel graphics bothering. It looked good, and I can't imagine anyone really being bothered by it.There's one thing that bothered me a bit, which is the lenght of the game, you can knock this one out in one afternoon. It's easy to learn, yet surprisingly hard to master. It took me quite a few tries to get an A+ score on 'Decadence'.But if you don't care about high scores and just want to shoot b!tches up, the game will be over before you know it.The verdictHotline Miami is a nice game you can play in between AAA games. In a way it's relaxing to keep on killing baddies without purpose. And that's the goal of the game, entertain you, without really doing anything, just give you a weapon and a level. You figure it out. The mask bonusses are nice, but you'll find yourself using one or two masks all the time, depending on your play style.I'd give it an 8/10."

The soundtrack is amazing, it fits the game perfectly with the 80's setting.The gameplay is great and extremely hard, it's fast paced and when you die you can instantly respawn by pressing R, so no loading times between deaths and when you die, which you will do a lot, you get angry but you want to try again. It's like super meat boy, it's frustrating when you die but fun and extremely addictive, it makes you angry but a good kind, it's a mix of adrenaline and challenge which keeps you coming back.

Relentlessly driven forward by a pumping soundtrack of 8-bit heavy retro synth-wave tunes, so hypnotic in quality it's like sliding into a warm bath of reckless and frenzied aggression without ever noticing. Think of Hotline Miami as the last scene of Scarface (1983), but in place of a cocaine mountain there's a fractured psyche hiding behind a latex mask, and in place of an M16A1 assault rifle there is a katana... or a hammer... or a power drill or whatever is at hand to smash some random guy's head in."

,Recommended,219150,7852758,"Posted: 30 November, 2013",all,RadKit,"A High Octane and Super Visceral TreatAt first glance Hotline Miami might be easy to over look as some weird short-form over the top gore fest without anything else to offer.Well okay, Hotline Miami is defiantly a short-form super gore filled game, its also got a great story, tight controls, fantastic music, and huge amounts of replay value, all wrapped up in a $15 package.I myself kinda glossed over the game, as I will often do with things that seem like gore just for gore's sake or trying too hard to be trippy, but once I gave the game a shot, I fell in love with just about every aspect of it.Not going to spoil anything about the wonderful psychologically mind bending story but you essentially play a hit man who wears masks, there are dozens of masks you unlock as you play and each brings its own special ability to the table, mix that in with dozens of weapons (melee, thrown and guns) and a combo system that rewards recklessness and variation... I could go on and on, but really Hotline Miami is a treat to play in just about every way imaginable.Basically you have a mission in each level to kill everyone else there, each mission is really only minutes long, but you might find yourself playing for hours as you die with one or two bullets or one hit from a baseball bat (or crowbar, knife, etc). But your foes are just as weak, and you have the advantage of being the instigator, move quickly from foe to foe crushing heads with out alerting adjoining rooms with melee weapons or throw just about any weapon to knock a man down and ground pound him into hamburger Fire off a gun and the noise will draw a crowd... into a door way or around a bend and right into your loving embrace. There's never a right mask or right weapon for the right time, its all up to your choices on the fly, arguably the best is when your plans go awry and you need to think fast, swapping weapons and facing several baddies in the blink of an eye.That might make it sound easy but, you will die, probably hundreds of times, over and over, quickly mashing the R key to begin the 30 - 60 second segment again, you'll quickly learn a lot of ins and outs of combat and soon feel like a rampaging powerhouse of destruction, despite always being one mistake from death. There is no bad finish to a level, because if you've made it through a level, it was by the skin of your teeth. The story, achievements high scores or just trying out different tactics and different weapons will keep you playing the levels again and again.The graphics are a super old school retro look, and maybe could be a little more defined in spots but mostly will have you very easily identifying who is what and what is what and where to go with ease. There are some particularly good psychological effects that the game uses at times and for me it really does a great job embracing the madness The animations are fantastic as there's often a different ""ground attack"" for each melee weapon, as well as different swinging speeds and animations depending on which of the several weapons you've grabbed.Perfectly matching look and feel of the game is the bouncing rapid paced crazy electronic sound track to keep your blood pumping fast and furious I find myself with random songs from the game in my head all the time, and do occasionally listen to the soundtrack outside of the game.If any one part of the game was lacking, the sound, the graphics, the controls, the story, it would really break apart very quickly, however none of that happens, its a perfect storm and it will rock you and keep you playing well past the end of the game and beyond."

The art style, coupled with the amazing soundtrack, completely captures the 1980's setting and mood. The graphics are beautiful and the game runs as smooth as butter (and I can't believe it's NOT butter! It's Hotline Miami). The gameplay fully envelops your attention and is extremely difficult. The levels are designed perfectly and allow you to plan your next moves strategically. And even though most of the game's levels will take you at least ten tries minimum, you probably won't even be mad simply because of the game's perfect execution of a fast-paced hardcore bloody top-down shooter. I highly suggest Hotline Miami to anyone with $9.99 (or $3.99, because it was on sale when I wrote this) that's willing to get more than their money's worth. Worth every cent. 1989/10."

But the only way you can find out is if you play this game.So in this top down shooter you step into the blood spattered boots of two “hero’s” as they carve a bloody streak through Miami’s underworld. Now to say that this game is gory is an understatement, but due to its amazing retro art style the copious amounts of blood, guts and death seem little more than a fever dream, as does this game as a whole. The aesthetic is one that I found very like a comic book, I know it’s done in 16 bit but it’s so stylised, bright and vibrant that I was enthralled immediately.The way the story draws you in is the same way a mad man scrawls his name in blood on the walls of his padded cell, that is to say both are fruit loops crazy but in my analogy at least the crazy guy is using his own blood and not hundreds of other peoples whom have the audacity to want to keep it all inside themselves and not share.Now back to the story, you start off knowing nothing, you go on knowing a little more of nothing, until the game ends and you know a tiny bit more than if you hadn’t bothered starting. There’s a shadowy organisation using you to further their bloody campaign on crime but that’s about it. This is not to say the game isn’t compelling I found myself face stomping my way through goons at a rate Usain Bolt would be proud of just to see what would happen next and the endings, yes plural, two “hero’s” two endings do wrap the everything up quite well.Now the game itself is for a lack of a better word, bloody fantastic. You can approach each stage in a huge number of different ways using a very large arsenal masks, one of your characters loves those and each one gives you different weapons or abilities. And whilst you may be content to just kill everything in sight and march all the way to the finale this game is actually a pretty well done score attack adventure and you would have missed most of the pleasure… and misery.To get the best scores you have to complete every stage faster than lightning with as many different executions and combo kills under your belt as you can manage. This is where the challenge lies, the game itself is hard but to do it perfectly is insanely difficult but so rewarding that it’s crazy and you would be nuts to try. But since we are all psycho’s who love masochism have at it.The sound track is great, but as is the standard for all games sent in the 80’s, I think it’s a law or something. The gameplay is phenomenal, you will fail a lot but every single time it is your fault, the game is punishing but not a cheater. I cannot recommend this enough for people who love a challenge. I had hours of fun and frustration in equal measure.Have fun ^_^"

You can go down with one shot, making the game all about planning your moves before executing them, and it is difficult, but the completion feels ever so satisfying. Its perfect at what it does leaving the only demand being more. Thankfully it has highscores, a large variety unlockables and achievements to deliver just that. Though there is enough variety in the weapons, there could have been more weapon types aside from just melee and ranged. Perhaps weapons that could be setup, like mines or tripwires.

With it's fast, reaction based gameplay and interesting story, you'll be wanting to play this game for hours on end.with its pixel based graphics, many people wouldn't acknowledge just how pretty this game actually is. They use a full blend of neon colours that really make the game pop, along with satisying character animations. You'll always feel good when you bash in your enemies skulls with a baseball bat or gouge out their eyes with your hands.The level design in this game brings variety to the table, with each level having its own neat little challenges that you have to overcome in order to progress through to your objective. Each mission feels fresh and that gives you all the more reason to play more, wondering what you're going to be doing next.The game mechanics in this game are simple, but hard to master. Each weapon will one shot most enemies, however, all enemies can one shot you. This makes you think about your decisions before entering each room and makes you feel extremely vulnerable, especially in the later stages. Some situations in the game are kind of unfair however, slinging you into situations where you can't avoid death, due to the extremely fast reaction times you have to have. You have to die in order to figure out what to do, which slows down gameplay. Respawning doesn't take much time however, so the time wastage isn't a huge deal but it's a little problem never the less.The music.... oh my god, the music! Created by M|O|O|N, Sun Araw, Perturbator, Elliott Berlin, Jasper Byrne, Scattle, Eirik Suhrke, CoConuts and El Huervo. Each song in the Hotline Miami soundtrack has its own unique feel, adding to the atmosphere in the game. The music always fits to the situation that you'll be in and sets the tone perfectly for the stages. This has got to be my favourite chiptune soundtrack in a video game to date.There is plenty of replayability in this game, due to various achievements, secrets and masks that you have to unlock if you want to 100% complete this game.I highly recommend this game if you like old school style games that are challenging, yet rewarding."

The combo system provides a pleasing extra level of depth to combat.One of the most striking parts of the game is the music, which suits the gameplay perfectly. A blend of 80's house music and chip tunes locks in with the gameplay, creating a rythmic flow to a murderous rampage.A must play."

,Recommended,219150,8654118,"Posted: 10 January, 2014",all,Reserved for 3rd Strike.,"Took me a while to finally remember its existence (due to a number of reasons namely I HAVE SO MANY GAMES ON ME. LITERALLY). But I digress. I wanted to give it a go due to another fact that a lot of people held praises for this game and I wanted to know what the fuss was about. Downloaded the game and started playing it.4 hours have passed like nothing when I first played through this addicting game. The game is challenging, one hit and you're out. Typical old-school style. Unlimited checkpoints though which kinda evens out the challenge. You get all kinds of weapons from simple knives to ♥♥♥♥ing double barrel rifles to even throwing objects like shurikens, darts and even scissors. The gore level is cranked way high in this game, regardless of the fact that its art style is an 8-bit style orgy-fest with neon filled aesthetics that act as a throwback to the 80s as the game takes place in '89 Miami, Florida. You start off bare-handed and you have to choose through a number of animal masks, each can give you a certain power that can enhance your play or even hamper it. Your default mask 'Richard' or the 'Rooster' mask doesn't give you any power and is the first mask you star off with. The objective of the game is simple. You go into a house/mansion/apartment or what have you where you start killing off the enemies one by one to clear the stage, and by doing so you get points as rewards for your killings and of course like any game with great design, the game encourages you- the player to be diverse in your killings and not stick to just one style. You can shoot your way out of a level sure, but don't expect a rank higher than a C or even a C-. The more enemies you kill without a break is called a combo, and as the combo meter racks up so do the points. You can strangle, mutilate, break, mash, bash, cut the living♥♥♥♥♥♥out of your enemies. No remorse. No mercy. You will die a lot in this game. And by a lot, I mean A WHOLE ♥♥♥♥ING LOT. There's even an achievements called 'Karma' that's got when you die 1000 times. Even the ♥♥♥♥ing developers know how ruthless this game can get. Nevertheless, the game IS addictive and IS fun and keep in mind always that every time you die, you learn. Unless you have a brain capacity of a I.R Baboon'http://imgur.com/edswIPX'. You do whatever it'll take to survive. This game requires concentration, patience as well as quick feet. Waiting too much decreases the number of points you'll gain at the end of each level, so be on your toes the whole time you're playing this. The more points you gain, the more weapons you unlock after racking up a certain number of points as well as new masks to discover and use to your advantage. Enemies come in different shapes and sizes from regular ones that carry all different kinds of weapons, to dogs that can't be put out by your bare fists to huge black enemies that need to be taken out by guns- and only guns. A game like this is probably not that story driven, but think again. You play as a character that goes by the name of Jacket 'that was picked by the fans oddly enough' as he keeps getting weird phone calls spewing out riddle-fest sentences that translate out to orders that orders Jacket to go to a designated place and kill off its residents one by one. In addition, Jacket keeps getting weird visions as he's visited by three anonymous figures; one wearing the Rooster mask keeps plaguing Jacket with weird portends and questions, whilst the one wearing the horse 'Don Juan' mask shows sympathy and concern over Jacket. The last one wearing the Owl or 'Rasmus mask keeps scolding Jacket and expresses utter abhorrence towards him. And in later stages in the game, he keeps seeing those that he has killed before in places like a bar or outside of a pizza store with a guy that 'surprisingly' has an omnipresence during the whole game that says to him afterwards that all of what he's been seeing is an illusion.What's rather interesting here that the game gives no explanation to the identity of those 3 who keep visiting jacket, not even giving a subtle hint to who or what they are. It doesn't even explain those illusions he'd seen. It's up to the player himself to interpret the identities of the three masked dudes and the weird illusions and what they're saying or mean to Jacket. The game keeps you on the edge of your seat as the story progresses, and what I really loved about the presentation of this game that, besides Jacket not having any voice nor dialogue and has only his surroundings and actions flesh out his character -SPOILER ALERT- 'For example in chapter 3 when he saved the Hooker instead of killing her even though he has proven to be a psychopathic cold-hearted killer where he could have just killed or at least left her in her state and let her die.' -END OF SPOILER- Or the fact that Jacket has an NES in his living room which probably shows that the guy is a gamer. Of course, this review cannot conclude without the mentioning of the game's soundtrack, which is excellent and immersive and just ♥♥♥♥ing epic beyond measure and deserves the prize for one of THE best soundtrack for a video game- ever. I recommend every damn track in this game for a listen, but my favorite has to be 'It's safe now' by Scattle. It feels like your watching an 80s porno with this track in the background.I recommend this game on PC, due to the fact that the mouse controls are way merciful that the analog sticks found on consoles (especially for the shooting of course). Regardless that about 99 % of those I know that will try it on PC will pretty much pirate the game, I say this to you; Buy this game. The developers deserve every single penny paid for this game and they've brought out a really, REALLY solid title that will keep you on the edge of your seat the whole way through. This game will frustrate the living ♥♥♥♥ out of the player, but is in turn addicting and most important of all: FUN. Nowadays it takes a miracle for a game to be fun under all the pretty, mindbogglingly sophisticated graphics and lightening and pretentious storytelling and characters."

One of the goriest 2D games I have ever played, Hotline Miami never leaves you with a dull moment. With fast paced action, interesting mechanics, numerous weapons, and a deep underlying story, this is easily one of the best titles out there.MUSIC: 10/10The music is somewhat strange at times, yet this all adds to the feel of the game. The first time I played the game, a combination of the music and visuals left me with a headache that lasted 2 days. However, once you get used to it, you will be dying to listen to the soundtrack again.ART: 10/10Whilst simplistic, the art style doesn't fail to attract your attention, and they have really captured the feel of a retro game. On top of this, they added a chromatic film over the game itself, causing an effect similar to that of LSD.GAMEPLAY: 9/10The gameplay is fast paced and unforgiving, a very fun feature allowing for perfection. The weapons you can find each time are randomised, allowing for a different experience each time through. Many mechanics are a learning experience, but once you get used to them they don't pose much of a problem. The only actual problem I have with the game is that occasionally the AI does game breaking things, such as leave a room that 99/100 times they wouldn't have done, or not chase you out of a room no matter how many times you try to bait them. Therefore, the gameplay regrettably only gets a 9/10.OVERALL: 10/10Despite the unpredictable AI, this game is the best of its kind, providing a fun, fast paced and unique experience that will enthrall and excite you. I would definitely recommend this game, and it is a must have for any steam library.STEAM NOMINATIONSA game about perfection - everything you do, you realise you could've done it a little faster, a little more accurately; things could've gone better. So you reload, you play again, you learn more. The more you play, the more higher you realise the limit of play can be. So you say to yourself: ""Just 5 more minutes"". Well, what better game to win the Steam award than this one, then?"

It is somewhat reminiscent of the early Grand Theft Auto games, in both appearance and theme, though it is much more fast paced than that. It manifests itself as a top-down, two-dimensional shooter (or brawler). Typically, the mission objective is to just kill everyone. While that seems like a simple objective, the game makes it very challenging.Death comes quickly, and the only advantage that you have over the enemy is that you aren't an AI with predictable activities. You die as easily as you kill enemies, and there are a lot of enemies. You will find yourself restarting a floor many times before you finally emerge as the victor. It's not a painful experience, though. Each time you die, you seem to gain a little insight as to how you might better accomplish your mission. The result is that clearing a room is quite a gratifying experience.When you get tired of killing guys in white suits, the game gives you a new enemy to make it more challenging, or interesting.  For what it costs, this is a very entertaining game, and I don't think you would regret at least trying it."

The way you can respawn when you die( which you will do a lot) by simply pressing 'r'. It does get incredibly frustrating, like when a van breaks through a wall and people flood out, you just get run over so many times, it is nearly impossible to dodge if you haven't previously died and are prepared for it. There is a level that is ridculous because it is forced stealth thruogh a hospital and if you get spotted you fail and hve to start from the nearest save point, I found that level terrible and difficult. If you are looking for a single indie game on Steam, I would highly recommend you purchase this wonder of a game. The soundtrack is good, so I would recommend buying it if you like 80's music! The soundtrack is expensive for a soundtrack, but that can only mean that it was so succesful! When rating it, I could only give it a certain 10/10, I very, very highly recommend this game, but- if you have them- don't lrt your kids see it because it is incredibly gory and creepy, not in things jumping out creepy, but you play as a person who is completely insane and frequently gets visited by the masks he wears when going on massacres, but they are actually characters in the game and are quite eerie.

The way this game handles is hard to describe; you need quick reflexes and you need to make sure someone isn't covering the guy you want to kill because you die in one hit, making the game feel frantic like a twin stick shooter, yet tactical like a very bloody game of chess. It's definitely something you need to play to understand, and I'm pretty sure I'll be playing it through again for the secrets, unlocks, and achievements... Just don't sit little Timmy down in front of this one."

Whatever I mean by that, Hotline Miami captures it in every way. With the sickly bright visuals, the unflinching and brutal violence, the hypnotizing soundtrack, and the surreal plot, it sets itself apart as one of the most distinct experiences in indie gaming. It's comparable to drugs, getting under your skin and becoming a game you play by feel more than sight. You'll get into a flow and completely lose yourself in the violence, only for the last enemy to die. Then the music cuts abruptly, a dull buzzing plays, and you slowly walk back to your car through the trail of maimed bodies.Everything moves so fast, you don't even have time to think, you just have to react instinctively. The feel of the action very much compliments what's going on in the protagonist's head. No time to stop and think, only to act, and react, as fast as possible, no matter the consequences. The best games don't just have you play as a character, they make you feel like you *are* the character, and the gradually deteriorating mental state of a brutal killer wouldn't look like anything else than what you see in this game. The violence, intensity, and difficulty aren't going to be for everyone, but this is among my most loved of indie titles on the market."

Not out of rage at the game, but due to the sheer murderous mind the game implants into your head.As you play this game, you will become a murderer. On the first level, the gore may creep you out a bit, but after that you wont pity any more Russian mobsters. This game will have you panicking desperately, making split second decisions and planning out your paths after the 1000th time you die. You'll feel like you're fighting for your life, but at the same time, you'll happily accept the call and go to the designated place and split open a few heads with a crowbar.And what makes this game so intense is the extremely fast pace of it... and the music. If you walk in front on a man with a gun, you have about 0.2 seconds to kill him or you're done. All of this transforms you into a psycho for the time you are in the game. Trust me, if you are impressionable or get all pumped after watching a movie or something, please don't play this game for the safety of the people around you, because it will turn you into a murderer.But the one thing, the main thing that is most murderous about you is the creepy as ♥♥♥♥ rubber masks.

Hard to pre guess the entire story. Instead you get to work a bit to unlock this exotic story of carnage, mayhem , and of course lots and lots of death. The music for this game will indeed minimize you and make you lost in the world of Hotline Miami.The album made the game that much more amazing.Mind you, this game is no cake walk. Be prepared to die ...but Fret not my good sir, the game is indeed punishing for not thinking quickly but does reward for recklessness. That's right folks, this game has a score system like a classic arcade game. More kills you get within a set time frame, the more points. The more kills with melee gives you more points then lets say a gun.. This game was always a recommendation to me few years back, but I just wish I checked it out sooner.Pros-Excellent story without feeling overwhelmed-Gruesome fighting as well as finishers-Many Different Mask each with separate abilities to guarantee more excitement and countless styles to kill with-Engaging boss fights that require some skill or planning to take on-Music is perfectly tuned for the gameCons-Can be to hard for some individuals-Can be easily frustrating on certain levels-Press R to restart button can make you hate keyboardsIf you are still on the fence of this game just ask yourself; Do you like Hurting other People"

I really enjoyed this game for the soundtrack, gameplay, and pure fun haha. Who knew a top-down shooter could be so fun?Gameplay: Top-Down Shooter that takes place in 1989. Pixelated too makes it kinda cool. You play as Jacket, who kills the Russian mobsters. You can either eliminate them one by one, or go shoot everything up, which is faster-paced and chances of dying are much more.In Hotline Miami, It's more about surprising your enemies and stuff. The gameplay is fun, yet challenging. It took me about 6 hours to beat the game, yet after I beat it, it's still a fun game to replay.Soundtrack: OMG the music is addicting. The style gives the game more feel when you play it. What I like is that when you die, the music never gets interrupted. The only time it gets interrupted is when you face a boss (which goes to another soundtrack), get to a cutscene, or complete a map.Difficulty: The game can be pretty difficult at sometimes, You will die with one swing or a gunshot. However, there are different masks in the games that give you abilities. I challenge you complete it with the standard Richard mask tho haha. Once you get used to the game, you can beat it easier with strategy.Replay Value: I've played it over again a few times now and then when I run outta games to play. The good thing is you can jump around chapters after you beat teh game. I just pick a random chapter and continue the massacre. ;3What I liked:Gameplay,Replay Value,The action can keep you on your feet.Difficulty makes you want to keep trying to beat the game.What I didn't like:Sometimes I didn't spot enemies and a random gunshot comes out of nowhere and gives me a jumpscare.Difficulty can make me frustrated sometimes.Bosses can be frustrating.Story can be a bit confusing.My final thoughts:Hotline Miami is a really fun game that keeps you on your feet when you do missions. Soundtrack is amazing, Gameplay can be either fast pace shoot up, or eliminate one by one. Ultimately, I think this game has great replay value, although it can be frustrating at times. I would give the game a 9.5/10.Also, I got it for $2.50 USD on sale, which is 75% off! I recommend waiting for the sale. Cheers!"

You begin a bloody murder spree that you are hardly aware you are conducting until the music abruptly stops, the level completed, and you are forced to walk back through the building among the dozens of corpses that you murdered. And why? Because you interpreted a vague phonecall as a command to kill? Then you wake up and do it again. And again. And again. Falling into the rhythm of it, blowing someone's head off with a shotgun and turning around to throw it at another who's head you kick in. All while pulsating colors flicker in the background and the driving music throbs. You are visited in your dreams by strange men wearing animal masks who ask you accusingly ""Do you like hurting people?"" and refuse to give you any information, telling you there is no point to anything. As time goes on, you become more and more brutal, and nothing ever appears to justify or explain the killings.Hotline Miami is a surreal, brutal game with its amazing combination of classic gameplay and disturbing atmosphere. The top-down gameplay is very rhythm based and adrenaline inducing. Highly recommended as an amazing experience for both those interested in it's pure adrenaline gameplay and those seeking it's disturbing surreal experience. In addition, the soundtrack is excellent, complementing the game perfectly. 10/10, one of the greatest experiences you can get from both indie and mainstream gaming."

It's well worth picking up.Gameplay: You control a hitman, but not the agent 47 type. This hitman goes in and brutally murders everyone in sight. No stealth whatsoever. Want to bang someone's head on the floor till it becomes a shapeless mass? Go ahead.There is still tactics though because you die in one hit, so you'll either plan out you movements in advance or just jump into the action hoping for the best. By the way this game also has a quite intriguing storyline.The visuals: It's pixel art so I guess you're either ok with the style or can't stand it.The music: The music in this game is really awesome and fits the game style and atmosphere really well. The game would be worth it just for the music alone.Final verdict: All in all Hotline Miami is a fun and sometimes challenging game that is well worth the selling price. Just bare in mind that under the pixel graphics lies lots of very brutal murder so it's not suited for everyone.PS. Fun fact: The creators of this game found this game pirated on a certain torrent site. What did they do? They informed the torrent author that they are releasing a new version of the game soon so he should add that and that they don't mind the pirated version being available because they want as many people as possible to enjoy their games. Paying a few $ for their game is the least we can do to support such sincere developers."

You can't deny that. All human beings get some sort of satisfaction or entertainment at the cost of someone else getting hurt or maimed. That's just in our nature. Don't you ♥♥♥♥ing tell me I'm wrong, I'm sure you've laughed at guys getting hit in the balls on America's Funniest Videos before. There's little old ladies in the studio audience that probably baked fresh, chocolate chip cookies for their grandchildren right before too. Just sitting their with their little grandma spectacles, laughing it up as a million potential lives are snuffed out as a skateboarder does the ol' nonconsensual splits on a railing.There's a spectrum to it, it's not like everyone deeply wants to dismember people in their spare time. But you're a♥♥♥♥♥♥ deep down. Everyone is.But now you can wear a rooster mask and hurt as many people as you like.No strings attached, man. Just put the mask on and start chopping. It's that easy. That's how they do it in real life too. Once the mask is on you're no longer bound by the laws of man. It also magically means you leave no DNA evidence. You might worry about leaving fingerprints, but you can just put masks on your hands too.Hotline Miami, available on PC, PS4, PS3, and whatever a PS Vita is, is a beautiful monster. A psychedelic rollercoaster of gore and twisted limbs. Drugs, sex, and a unicorn mask. Or for people like me, your average Saturday night.Because I like to play Hotline Miami on a Saturday night, of course... Ha ha... Totally not a sociopath or anything.I'll be honest, I had no clue what was happening for most of Hotline Miami. It was a blur of neon and blood. It was like I dropped some acid and tried to sit through a marathon of Alvin and the ♥♥♥♥ing Chipmunks. I wasn't sure who's blood I was drenched in, but I loved every second of it. Only in Hotline Miami, you're killing members of the Russian mafia or something.Gameplay is super satisfying in all the best ways. It's fast, it's brutal, and it's mercilessly difficult. And yet at the same time, forgiving. Deaths are brief and unceremonious, and respawns are even faster. Featuring a blend of super quick twitch shooting, and tactical planning and strategizing, Hotline Miami is probably the closest thing to the actual feeling of shooting up a building. No matter how much planning and strategy you put into it, once you're out there everything you've planned crumbles nearly instantly. It all comes down to twitch reactions and desperate, instinctual reflexes. It's unpredictable and brutally messy. And sometimes, no matter how well you planned and how well things were working out, a single bullet can end everything.You have no health bar. Your enemies have no health bar. There's no energy shields or barriers or armor. If you get cracked in the head with a lead pipe, you're ♥♥♥♥ing dead. If you get shot in the head, you're ♥♥♥♥ing dead. If someone shanks you in the gut, you're ♥♥♥♥ing dead. But it works both ways. Your enemies are just as weak and flimsy as you are. It gives you a sense of the fragility of human life. Of how easy it would be to just end someone. There's no ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, there's no fluff. In the split second you kick the door down to where your enemies are sitting, someone is dying. And it's going to be either you or them. It's a flip of the coin, really. Maybe your aim is bad, maybe their aim is worse. Maybe you move faster than they can react, and you get to nail them in the head with a bat right as they look you dead in the eye. Or maybe they'll notice you coming and gun you down before you can lift a finger.It's all on the line. The adrenaline rush is amazing, and even at its hardest the frustration is never greater than the pay-off.If you manage to kill with style and sociopathic grace, you'll be rewarded with greater and greater ways to kill. New masks to enhance your innate abilities, and new weapons to crush and dismember with terrifying ease. There's even some rare hidden collectibles strewn about that hold the key to a secret ending.Its near perfect mechanics and game feel aren't even the best part though. Hotline Miami is a mess of color and has a killer soundtrack to boot. The game looks and sounds gorgeous. The music gets your blood pumping just as much as the looming threat of death. It has a definite electronic/techno sound to it, though the tracks can range from killer bass to tropical vibe.It's not a particularly long game unless you dedicate yourself to 100%ing it, but it's definitely a fun trip to rush through. You can sink hours into the game without even realizing it, because the entire game is so fast-paced. I breezed through it relatively quickly, and it left me hungry for more.Lucky for me, I have a couple masks myself. I can always go out and have my own fun.Trick-or-treating, I mean. With my Halloween mask. Ha ha, not gonna go  the Russian mafia or anything.Just gonna give them a little candy, you know? And then shoot them in their ♥♥♥♥ing face."

,Recommended,219150,23078145,"Posted: 19 May, 2016",all,BLOODSH⊕T,"Thrilling and engaging from the fast paced gameplay alone, this is further amped up by a twisting and shifting plot that raises more questions than answers at the end of it. Fuzzy, distorted, 80's style synth music sets the tone of each scene well- from frantic and badass, to placid and even psychedelic, back again to flat, morose, disturbed.If the methodical murder setpieces, subversive narrative and music all prove engaging for you, this is an experience well worth the price.One flaw this game has is that sometimes, stuff just doesn't work- in a game where there are no second chances or quickasves once you've dicked up a stage, you'd expect the combat to feel responsive, for every swing that's aimed well and in range to hit it's mark, and unfortunately... Well, I guess you could describe the feel of combat in a worst case scenario as hit or miss- but when the game does work and the pieces all come together, there's nothing quite like it.Another problem is finishing moves- more often than not you end up having to temporarily incapacitate a target in a room, eliminate someone more dangerous/well armed, and then take out the other sucker before he gets back up, which is as easy as hitting space and clicking until the guy beneath you is pink mush... In theory. In practice, you're gonna end up hovering frantically over the man you've just knocked down, mashing the space button to no avail, and worst case scenario you end up brained yourself as he gets back up, grabs the nearest object or firearm and wastes you- and then it's back to the start of the stage. RIP.Finally, and this is more just of a subjective thing, this game can be cheap with enemy placements, mechanics and movement. You start out thinking the idea is to learn the enemy movement patterns and plan accordingly, but more often than not one ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ enemy will go and do something completely random at the worst possible time, and then you're screwed through no fault of your own. Or you meet a new enemy type that the beginning tutorial didn't cover, with special properties such as being bulletproof, not being vulnerable to doors, etc. and bang, rip, crunch, you're dead.Overall, it's worth the cost- these problems sound huge, but in a game as fast paced and satisfying as this, they're hardly even an issue- you just press R to restart and five or ten seconds in, you're back where you last died, right as rain and a little bit smarter than you were before."

The VHS aesthetic is visibly pleasing and puts you somewhat in this hyperviolent version of the 80's. All the violence and gore makes you feel like you are a character in a Tarantino flick particularly the Bride. The score is amazing and keeps you pumped during all the countless times that you will die. Most of the masks that you collect are unique and each mask feels like it can suit a certain level far down the road or your own particular playstyle. My personal favorite mask is Don Juan simply because you can kill people with doors. It is exhilarating to finally complete that level that has been troubling you for so long. The story of the game is pretty great too. It is also fun to unlike all the various weapons to kill people with from katanas to beer cans. Just think of any weapon and you can probably use it.

You play as a unnamed man but as the fans call him ""Jacket"" every night you get strange cryptic phone calls from an unknown person telling you insturctions. Then you head into your car and go into a night of killing...Hotline Miami is a fantastic game since it combines puzzle and action since guards hear gunshots and that melee weapons are silent. Be warned you will die quite a lot in this game cause it's pretty hard but fair at the same time. The enemy's are predicatable with linear patterns that you can use to your advantage  but sometimes a guard might stray of his usual path throwing you off. Also there are many ways to deal with each level which makes the replay value quite high since you can either go stealth or go in guns blazing. The graphics fit the style of this game since it's drug induced and is set is the late 80's with lots of color and detail.Cons: Framerate sometimes drops randomly when playingEarl (Walrus) is glitched and you can't survive 2 bulletsIn conclusion Hotline Miami is a great title to pick up on the Summer Sale and is worth the asking price 9/10"

,Recommended,219150,16609238,"Posted: 21 June, 2015",all,Candy Danii 💘,"Remember these days people? When games were just about violence?  Postal, Doom, etc.  Where it was just to murder everything in your path regardless of who it was or what it has done etc.  Well those days are gone! Now we have a game that is nothing but that! Quite litterally.PROS:Fun Gameplay: This game is nothing but murdering everything from the dandelions on upwards in any household that some random dude on the phone tells you to do regardless of if you want to but I guess that's because it's half the fun.  Running into some random person's building and just bashing everyones skulls in or shooting them up with a gun till all of their guts spill out or their head gets blown off.Masks: Each mask has a different ability, which I thought was a neat little mechanic for the game since each level can be played a little differently each time with it's own abilities.  Like Dennis starts with a free knife, Peter has silent bullets but somehow some people aren't fully def or something, Ted means dogs won't even care that you're there or murdering their owners, etc.Story: As far as the story goes it's neat I suppose, where random things happen like you get put into some room talking to 3 people wearing a horse, rooster, and owl mask which I'm STILL convinced this is basically your subconcious or something.  And later when it's hard to tell what's real and what's fake since everything seems the same with the 80's vibe around the game with the colors and areas you go to.Soundtrack: This is one of the few things that got me into this game was the really catchy soundtrack, one of my friends showed the ""Knock"" song to me and I instantly got hooked onto the rest of the soundtrack.  Granted some I don't really like but the large majority of them I do.  I keep hearing the 2nd game has a hit and miss soundtrack which I kind of agree on since some of the songs are great where others just sound weird and boring, or way too pumped instead of being the mellow music this game has.Right back in the action: Instead of going through a REALLY long loading time when you die it's a instant reload into the area with no waiting, making sure you get right back into the action without you having to get too bored and lose the tension too quickly if at all.Satisfying after levels: I was trying to be strategic in most of the levels, like when to charge in, when to shoot, throw weapons etc.  But one level got on my nerves so badly I litterally just charged into a room with a pipe with 4 dudes inside, massacred all of them, and when they pulled off a shot the rest came and I just charged out beating the living s*%t out of the rest while they all lined up, it's like I was on ice skates.  Then afterwards I felt so rewarded and then thought ""What the f%*k is wrong with me?!""CONS:Aiming in general: I might be a bit biased with this.  You see, when I was growing up and playing top down shooters like this, I was used to the character moving AROUND the pointer on the screen, not the character moving WITH said pointer.  And in all honesty this ends up getting me killed quite a lot in this game which can get pretty frustrating.Throwing weapons: Don't get me wrong I like this idea, but the aiming with it is so freakin atrocious and finicky.  I threw a pipe at a dude when I was about 20 feet from him (Imagine Jacket is 6 feet tall for a reference) and half of the pipe went through him and it said I missed the throw.  Missed the throw? You've gotta be s*%#$ing me half of that pipe was lodged into his cranium and I MISSED?!  It starts to get annoying too since when Jacket throws the object it's not spot on accurate which just adds to the fire, kind of wish this would've been worked out a little more or something.Weapons: Weapons unlocks are a kind of Miss for me as far as the weapon system goes, yeah some things like the sledgehammer and machete are awesome to use but things like the Magnum or Skorpion seem pointless when I end up getting M4's with 24 rounds that can clear out most of a building.  Plus most melee weapons are identical to the last since you don't really seem to care what it is you're using as long as it kills, I wish they would've redone this system too, or at least added different weapons.Masks: Some of the masks feel utterly useless, I never used Rufus or Wilhelm or anything because if you get shot you can only survive like 1 M4 shot or pistol shot and since it's usually ending up being rapid fire and having pinpoint accuracy with every guard you may as well just put paper over you.  I wish they would've redid some of the masks so they seem a lot more useful.  I only ended up using Peter, Ted, and Don Juan since they were the most useful throughout the whole bloody game.Story: I was really interested in the story at first, but after around 3/4's of the way through it went right down the drain.  I won't really spoil much but I do have to say, going from the Insane and questioning life you get in the beginning, trying to figure out what's real or fake, and then going to that? It just kind of killed it for me, and the ending was a bit dissapointing but I found the normal one, so I'm going through to get the good one still, so that might be better.CONCLUSION:The game is fun, a bit ludicrous, but fun none the less and even after playing all of the levels I still really enjoyed going through the missions again so it does have some replayability.  In the end I'll give it a 8/10, it's really fun but some of the things I hate about it do get in the way at times but other than that I don't regret my purchase, and I hope you guys buy it as well.  Not the 2nd one though I honestly heard it was dog s*%t compared to this one, so save your money for this instead."

Nearly everything the developers did, was very right. Hotline Miami is a hyper-violent, dark, top down action game. It's essentially a fictional 1989 gruesome murder simulator. You play an unnamed character wearing a varsity jacket who gets phonecalls to go kill russian mobsters. You wear creepy animal masks that have an effect on the stage. To say anything more would ruin the experience of playing through the game. Just know that it's addictive, trippy, controls very well, has a perfectly fitting soundtrack (even if you don't buy the game, you should look up the soundtrack), engrossing, and will have you questioning everything that's going on more and more as you advance the story. The story is told and set up very well. Just pay attention to details and changes as you go through, or else you miss a lot.My two criticisms with the game aren't even full complaints, just, something about my expectations. First, I was expecting the game to be a little longer. I just expected a couple more missions or a longer epilougue, but I guess I have Hotline Miami 2 to look forward to huh? Speaking of the epilougue; yeah, I just thought there'd be more to it- could've had a more fleshed out side story.With those two criticisms it might seem like I had some issues with the game. Not really. I have no real right to complain. The game is worth it's $10 or so price tag. It's a welcome diversion from the mass markets of shooters and RPGs. It has a great deal of replay value from it's collectible masks, weapons, puzzle pieces, acheivements, and highscore/ranking system.Maybe I wasn't clear enough. Buy it. 8.5/10...*click*"

A level requires multiple tries to complete, and each time you have to deal with different envoirments and enemies.

You have to deal with the enemies spawning with different weapons, and you work out a strat for every small room and corridoor, constintly thinking of which mask could be easier to use.

,Recommended,219150,13022747,"Posted: 20 November, 2014",all,"Dr. Thadeus S. ""Rusty"" Venture","Hotline Miami is a top down shooter that is unforgivingly dificult and just as brutally violent. It's pixelated art style takes refrence from old action movies, as well as the neon athmosphere of Miami, Florida circa the late 1980s. One of the main gameplay mechanics is that while enemies will go down with a single swing of a melee weapon, or a single bullet, you don't gain any sort of health bar or armor or anything. One shot, one kill. It's a double edged sword. This thought will be pounding through your mind as you find yourself hiding behind a door, waiting for the perfect opportunity to kill the guard when his back is turned, knowing full well that your knife could easily fail you, and his shotgun pellets could easily make mince meat of you, and you'll have to do the whole floor again.However, the game encourages fast paced, somewhat wreckless decision making, and it is extremely satisfying to go on a killing spree, running from enemy to enemy, leaving carnage in every step of your wake. The music in this game is absolutely delicious. Taking music from artists such as Sun Araw and M.O.O.N. , Hotline Miami sets the mood and atmosphere perfectly. Fast paced, sexy techno music pulses and your mind does, trying to quickly make your next decision to keep your combo going and your character's feet moving without getting a 9 iron to the face.The story is somewhat unrewarding, but not as much as some titles. While the ending, which I won't spoil, isn't exactly the most rewarding, it feels a lot more like effort and time was put into the journey rather than the destination itself. There are a series of puzzle pieces scattered across each level, in which you can find more details about the story if you painstakingly collect them all. However, this doesn't change the ending at all. I'll say it again; the journey is much more rewarding than the destination.All in all, I would strongly recommend Hotline Miami, and I would recommend that players take some things with a grain of salt; the story isn't meant to be taken completely seriously, and completionism isn't nessesary. Enjoy the game to it's full potential, and don't take the whole thing too seriously. I currently wait in heavy anticipation for the sequel."

If this game had a meh soundtrack, I probably would've given up after the second chapter. But the soundtrack really gets your blood pumping, and fits the game perfectly.

The gameplay and mecanics are basically: Run, kill, die, repeat. That's pretty much it, going on a killing spree with diferent weapons against enemies with a one-shot dead difficulty that will make you restart a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of times. This kind of gameplay and the visuals might not be your cup of tea, but if it is, boy are you going to enjoy it.What interests me the most about this game is it's narrative. It revolves around a bunch of murderers with animals masks that kill russian gangsters, following orders of mysterious people leaving messages on their phones. The game is brutal, and it showcases a massive amount of extreme graphic violence, like executions, decapitations, broken bones, mutilated parts of the body, etc.And, both the character and the player, enjoy it. Why would you be playing this game otherwise? ""Do you like hurting other people?"". This phrase is presented at an early stage of the game, and everything is based around this. Hunger for violence. In the music during the slaughter, the adrenaline rush, the gore, the sudden music stopping to see all the people you just brutaly murdered on the way out.This game represents the most pure and hidden sadistic side of the people that play this kind of games. The desire to kill and destroy just by the pleasure of doing so. And I love it for being that way."

When I came across it on a Steam sale for 2.49 it really did not sell me, being top down, and at the time looked like some crappy flash game to me. Hot damn I wrong on my first impressions, the screenshots of the game on the store page really do not do the game justice, neither do the two videos, you really just need to experience it with some good headphones, and just FEEL how adrenalin infused and fluid the game feels.The game takes place in a pulpy/neo-noir ""alternative 1989 Miami"", where the eclectic neon lights, pulsating 80s themed tracks and hyper realistic violence make this game so damn special. The pixelated gore, multiple play styles, and underlying sinister tones of the game are really somthing else. If you like the movie Drive, Blade Runner, Sin City (or the Frank Miller comics) do yourself a favor and add the game to your cart and play it for a while, not more than 3 hours though (then you can't get a refund if you did not enjoy it). Also pick up or, look at the sequal Hotline Miami 2: Wrong Number if you enjoyed the first one, its freakin radical."

Also perhaps it misses a coop option.For some reason, despite completing the game, none of my Steam achievements have been recorded, it's probably just a bug on my system, but it's a first. Because the game's resolution is really low, your Steam overlay will be cutoff.Hotline Miami in my opinion tries to simulate the ""annoyance"" factor of some classics prior to 1993. But that was never the intention of the classic games. Now some people might like that challenge. They like to die about three hundred times and laugh every time they respawn ... if that's your thing, then whatever right?After playing about three levels, you sort of start to get into the story a bit. It's trippy and perhaps cheesy ... for some reason I keep thinking of the story in Barkley, Shut Up and Jam: Gaiden. Coincidently Hotline Miami uses the same game engine. Unfortunately this is a game engine I don't really like. There's nothing wrong with the engine, it's actually ok. But it's way too popular and accessible to use (maybe even more so than Unreal). I think it's even available on Steam as a result. Why not make your own Hotline Miami? Or choose from a plethora of other alike games? It's something to be considered before you purchase and invest some of your lifespan in it.Some notable features are the masks which you are only allowed to select before starting a level. Think of this like a ""character select"". Each mask has 1 single advantage over the other (or trippy uselessness). Like walking faster, starting off with a knife, more bullets ... etc.The music is probably the unique highlight of the game in my opinion. It was well made. SFX is also good. I like the chunky sound of the SPAS-12 shotgun.Gameplay wise, (ignoring what gets you most points as I don't believe in that letter grading garbage, I believe in having fun) what I usually do is use the knife mask or the extra ammo dude. There's a weakness in the game where if you're right at the edge of some corner or opening (including a door), you can slash a few enemies up. If it's a gun fight, just hold up somewhere like in L4D. No seriously!Surprisingly I find myself completing this game before Super Meat Boy, The Binding of Isaac and a few other 2D plaformers. Now, might that tell you something?"

,Recommended,219150,3383262,"Posted: 30 June, 2013",all,DarylSurat,"I bought this back in November when it was on sale for $5. (Nowadays it's part of indie bundles.) It's the kind of game based around mastery: getting high scores, unlocking everything, and the like. But after 8.5 hours, I'm not sure if I'd really bother with doing so.Hotline Miami is a top down action game where the idea is to kill everybody on the level such that you're rewarded for speed and using different methods on the enemies. You have to kill everyone on the floor you're on to advance to the next one. You die in one hit, and if you die you have to repeat the floor you're on. The enemies mostly appear in the same spots though there's some variation in what weapons appear, and at first you think ""I'd better try not to get seen or make noise."" In reality, the best way to go about things is to get seen then turn a corner/enter a doorway so the enemies run to you. Then you pick them off as they're making the corner. This works because THEIR gunshots don't alert everyone. Only YOURS would (though it doesn't necessarily send the entire floor running to you).The biggest problem I have with this game is that there are two control schemes and neither is what I would consider ""good."" Common sense suggests you'd just use a 360 gamepad and treat this like a twin-stick shooter. But the most important thing you have to do to stay alive is to shift the camera ahead of your field of view and lock onto targets. Doing this on the gamepad SUCKS. The default mouse and keyboard setup makes the act of turning quickly a pain, and the same input results in context-sensitive actions. Press right-click to throw your weapon away (it can hit enemies). HOLD right click to ""drop"" your weapon. But you also press right-click to pick weapons UP. This makes it very easy to accidentally die because performing the action of ""fire a gun, throw it away once it's empty/low, then pick up another gun and continue firing"" is now very VERY easy to screw up. That one instant often means the difference between victory and starting the floor over.But the main cause of my deaths in Hotline Miami wasn't that. See, I have a dual monitor setup. In this game, you use the mouse to turn your character's orientation as well as position the crosshair when looking ahead. For reasons beyond my comprehension, this game doesn't keep window focus. There are no real in-game customization options to speak of. So if you move your mouse to the right then click, there's a high probability that you now just task-switched out of the game because your mouse cursor went over to the second window. To regain focus...you have to click on the game window. Upon doing so, congratulations: you just fired a shot/discarded your weapon/changed your lock-on target when you didn't want to! So even though you can look and target much better with KB/M (probably the most important thing you do), at least the gamepad isn't going to switch you out of the game. Some people try to use both at once to counter this. I say patch the game! A patch is due out this week, but eh.There are boss fights, but I don't much like them. Because you respawn instantly and you have to find out what doesn't work the hard way, they're designed as rote memorization exercises for you to basically die over and over again on until you do EXACTLY what the game is looking for. Dying does not seem to affect your score, at least, and it's your score that drives many of the unlocks.I got my money's worth, but I don't see why this is on so many ""best of 2012"" lists. Some people think the developers are presenting this as criticism of videogame violence (the story is somewhat pointless and repetitive by design even if you get all the secret Scrabble pieces to get the password which gives you the REAL ending), but if that's the case it's kind of well, let's say more ""sub-textual"" than ""textual."" A sequel is due out soon, but I see no need to play it at launch."

Fast, one hit, deaths played to an intrancing extraordinary soundtrack set in a strange world telling a weird story, all mix to together to make one of the best games of the last few years.The difficulty of the one hit deaths just add to the thrill of finally venturing across the finish line of the a long, difficult level with a decent amount of large combos and an A+ rating on your back.What adds replayability to this game (not including just the sheer fun factor and the great story, as well as achieving highscores) is the mask system. As you go through the game, you can aquire new masks by either attaining highscores on the levels, or you can find different masks throughout the ingame environments.At the beginning of a level, you can choose from a diverse cast of different masks. These masks give you different abilities. It can be something simple, like walking faster, to a bit more game changing, like killing punches, killing throws, etc.The strange, surreal story follows a silent protagonist (dubbed 'Jacket') as strange messages are left on his answering machine, sending him to different adresses to kill the people there. Jacket hallucinates about three strange characters, wearing the masks he covered himself with as he killed. On top of that, there is a strange bearded man he sees at the different shops (a small convinence store, a pizza resturant, a video rental store, and a bar) he goes to in the outros the levels. (bear with me, I don't want to spoil anything)This game is truly great. I recommend this game and its sequel (Two games that greatly complement each other) to anyone who wants a good story and some challenging gameplay.-MandatoryAlcatrazAddendum (Date: 10/23/2015):Check out my Hotline Miami Mask Guide (NOTE:Minor spoilers!):http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=534104505"

There's a rhythm to the violence, it's about waiting for an opening, the death you deal out a blur as you smash your way through everyone and everything all in time with the beat of the music.Before every level, you can select a mask which has its own special ability. It allows you to tailor the game the way you want to tackle the level, all out violence or a more subtle approach. Timing is key and preparation essential as the threat of one hit instadeath is around every corner. When you burst through a door you have to make quick second decisions, do you attack the baseball bat wielding thug nearest you or deal with the one behind him with the machine gun? Of course you'll make mistakes and you'll die a lot but the music keeps you going, urging you onwards.Hotline Miami asks a simple question, do you like hurting people? and it's a question you'll ask yourself as you take apart a room full of people armed with little more than a meat cleaver. The answer is yes, we like violence and it's what keeps us playing, keeps us pushing onwards leaving behind hundreds of bodies in our wake."

It's a damn fun game that blends pixel art, 80's style and hyper violence all in one stylish messy package. The game utilises a top down perspective that plays similar to a brawler/beat em up with one hit kills on not just the enemies, but you yourself as well. Though you die often the game is never really unfair or cheap as it's trial and error gameplay keeps up a fast pace pushing you to keep trying, also it adds insentive into finding the best way to dispatch of the enemies in front of you to make a huge combo. The story is a little vague but it's trippy and interesting enough that it keeps you intrigued into continuing further with some small twists and turns to keep you guessing until the end. The gameplay is what sells it though, that in conjuction with the presentation. The pixel art whilst not mind blowingly original, does a great job at presenting the player with an inticing and beautiful style. In conjuction with this graphical presentation the game has a fantastic soundtrack that just oozes with 80's influence, with it's catchy synth lines and funky rhythms the soundtrack is something that will undoubtedly stick with you through the whole experience. So all in all Hotline Miami is something that you should definitely pick up if you want a stylish blood soaked good time, even more so now as it's probably dirt cheap as well!"

,Recommended,219150,27915344,"Posted: 27 November, 2016",all,Cosmic Crow,"Hotline Miami is basically a video game version of the films Drive and John Wick mashed up together. It's a fast-paced top-down action game that tasks you with eliminating all of the mobsters within a given level. At your disposal are guns, melee, and throwing weapons as well as your bare fists. Weapons handle in an arcadey fashion, with timing and awareness being everything. Selectable animal masks also provide various bonuses and can change the play style. You die in one hit but you can retry almost instantly, creating a satistying trial and error feedback loop and making the game sometimes feel like an RTS on cocaine. The aesthetics are neon, trippy and extremely 80's, and a killer soundtrack will keep you entranced and energized. I won't say too much about the plot, but it's a surreal thrill ride that will make you question reality and morality even as as you shoot and chop your way through dozens of enemies. It ain't your average pixel-studded ""retro"" action game, even if it looks that way. Highly Recommended. Nominated for the ""Best Use of a Farm Animal"" Award."

,Recommended,219150,10753134,"Posted: 24 June, 2014",all,adam west,"Though this game has a well made soundtrack, great graphics, and a creative backstory, the game lacks depth because of its poorly made combat system and over-the-top violence.The soundtrack of this game is very different and unique, which makes it one of the greatest OST's in a video game. The combination of electronic and alternative is executed very well, making it enjoyable to listen to while playing this high octane action game. The soundtrack, yet calming, is very appropiate and fitting for the game. If you do not buy this game, I highly recommend listening to it either on YouTube or from buying it as DLC.The graphics in this game are very unique, incorporating a dynamic HUD that shifts in color like you have a broken video card, and pixellated environments/characters. The aesthetics in this game give it a modern vibe in a retro setting, creating some sort of eye-candy.The combat system is well balanced, as you and the enemy can kill each other in one hit, the trial and error along with the RNG of weapon drops makes it overly punishing instead of difficult. Sure, you are going to need to dedicate time to planning your assault on most levels, the enemies don't always follow the same rules: enemies sometimes do not react to gunshots, or can kill you when they are dead, and many other bugs which not only break immersion but are extremely frustrating. It does not mean the game is difficult, because it can be, but that it is over-punishing due to the repetitive runs in an unpredictable environment. This makes the game incredibly annoying at times to play, and hugely diminishes its replay value.The violence in this game is very exaggerated and, in some times, disturbing. You can watch an enemy torturing someone hooked up to a bomb and the guts of an enemy after taking them down. This kind of violence serves no meaning to the plot, or conveys any idea in the story.. It is just, quoted in the description of the game, ""brutal"". Unlike games like Bioshock: Infinite, which use violence creatively, for example in juxtaposing extreme violence over an otherwise innocent city, this game uses it for the sake of being edgy and shocking.In conclusion, though this game is extremely violent and the combat/AI system is poor, I recommend playing it because of the excellent aesthetics and soundtrack the game provides."

The Letterman Jacket, the old classic car, the electronic music... But what really brings the two together in my opinion, is that both Drive and Hotline Miama go straight to the point: killer atmosphere, violence, enthralling music.Basically, Hotline Miami is a top-down shooter mixed with a die and retry game. And it's incredible. You're usually outgunned, outnumbered, and die in one-hit. You must rely on your skill and careful timing to finish each level, by slamming doors into people's face, punching them, squishing their heads on the ground, shooting them, throwing knives, slashing, cutting...The controls are sharp, and easy to grapsh: you use your keyboard to move, and your mose to target and hit.♥♥♥♥♥♥allows you to look further away. And that's that.Wait no, there's also the 'r' key. When you die, you simply push it to start again. No loading, no nothing. And believe me, you're gonna die. Again, again and again. Sometimes you'll miss your hit on the first mob encountered and die right away. Sometimes, you will get shot from the other side of the level by the last remaining dude. But you will rarely be mad about it, as the game is so hectic and the gameplay so rewarding. The missions are also fairly short, meaning you'll never lose 10 minutes of progress.There's about thirty weapons to use, from a beer can to a M16 or a frying pan. There's also a scoring system, rewarding you for taking risks, going fast and not using guns. Depending on how good you fare, you'll get a mark, from A+ to C-.The music, created by several electro indie bands, ranges from pretty good to ""HOLY-CRAP-THAT'S-AWESOME-I-CAN'T-STOP-DANCING"".Story-wise, while I wouldn't go as far as saying that Hotline Miami is deeply philosophical, it offers some reflexions about violence, including the player's wish for more carnage.All in all, a great game, saddly a bit short if you're not aiming for all the achievements."

It's trial and error gameplay and instant respawns work flawlessly together. The retro style graphics and vibrant color look great. The soundtrack is one of the most unique gaming soundtracks I have ever heard and each song fits each level. At the start of each level, you choose a mask to use, each with their own special ability, like one hit kill punches or silent gunshots. While there are a multitude of maskes to choose from, I found myself using the same mask for the majority of the game. There are masks that are clearly better than others, while some are there just for fun or added difficulty.The only complaint I had wth this game is minor, I feel like it could have been a bit longer. On your first playthrough, it seems a lot longer because you have to get used to the instant deaths and the way the game works in general, so it's a pretty decent length. But if you go and playthrough it again, whether it's to collect puzzle pieces, new masks, or just to beat your high score, it is significantly shorter. Since you are already used to the difficulty, the level layouts, etc. some levels can just be breezed through. I got through my second playthrough in two to three hours.That still is a very minor complaint and really the only one I have for this game.

Great soundtrack, addicting gameplay, brilliant story, the graphics were an eyesore at first but I grew into the retro look. There's some replayability. The game is pretty much one of the most innovative things I've ever played. A bit like FTL, Hotline Miami is punishing and you will die. A lot. The point is to improve both your skills as a player and your strategy as you restart over and over. The dev(s?) are great people, though they're a bit slow with patches, there really isn't a reason to not try the game. I think it may be the fastest paced action/puzzler I've ever played. There are a few minor issues, such as the Steam overlay won't work, and I crashed a few times when replaying old levels, the ai is a little buggy, but otherwise it's a pretty good 9.3/10."

You control the protagonist who is essentially going from place to place murdering everyone for reasons he is unclear of. You fight unarmed, viciously beat people down with melee weapons, or dispatch foes using several types of guns. Almost all weapons are obtained from killing enemies. Gameplay is pretty straight forward with a few things to look out for: gunfire can alert nearby enemies, swinging doors stun enemies, and throwing objects can be situationally very helpful.It only takes a few hours to finish all 20 chapters, but the game has some decent replayability in the collectible masks that change gameplay. Shout out to the fantastic soundtrack.+ Very fun, challenging gameplay. Allows you to plan your moves and be strategic. However, scoring rewards you for recklessness.+ High, but (mostly) fair difficulty. One bullet will kill both you and most enemies. Feels a little like a top down Dark Souls.+ Unlockable masks make a significant impact on gameplay.+ Fantastic 80s style soundtrack. Fits the game perfectly.± Extremely violent for a pixel styled game. The violence is played out in a way that makes it feel very realistic.- Only several hours of content for first playthrough.- Not very story centric. I apparently missed some extra bits during my first playthrough. However, I don't think they add much.- Heard some complaints of nausea due to the screen tilting. This didn't bother me, but I could see it happening to someone else.If the game looks at all interesting to you, I would highly recommend it. However, it is not for the squeamish or those looking for a story intensive game."

,Recommended,219150,13370460,"Posted: 14 December, 2014",all,Belmont,"It's hyper-violent retro arcade action, complete with the increasingly popular 'unreliable narrator' theme.  If you're cool with retro top-down games and SNES era graphics (which I am), you'll find it both interesting and challenging.  The combat is brutal and visceral and you'll invariably die a lot.  I wouldn't call it rogue-like since enemy placement is more or less fixed with very minor variation and the AI is fairly predictable.  But make no mistake, it's still difficult.  You are every bit as fragile as the scads of mobsters you'll be brutalizing and you'll have to plan your moves in advance or else have superhuman reaction time.The masks your unnamed character wears offer varying bonuses and effects - some just make the game harder while others nuance themselves to a certain playstyle or just make you feel cool.  Melee weapons can be swung or thrown.  Guns cannot be reloaded and thus you'll be counting your shots and doing your level best to make sure you've got a backup ready.  They can also be thrown to stun most enemies.  Given the number of times you'll likely die, it's a blessing the game re-starts the section you're on instantly with minimal cut-scene/dialogue delay.The graphics are fine - it's a retro game so it's difficult to really judge this.  The color is quite bright but that suits the game setting of 1980s-era Miami with all it's neon glitz covering the seedy criminal underbelly.  The soundtrack is definitely a highlight as it's completely fitting with both the setting and the themes of the story.  Most of the songs pump you up as you're busting into drug-dens and and mobster-mansions.It's not perfect - aside from getting high scores and unlocking all the masks and weapons, there's not a ton of replay value beyond the 'I haven't played it in awhile' or the 'I wanna see if I can beat it only using x"" excuses.  There is a secret ending that may earn a few extra play-throughs but it's nothing jaw-dropping.  Overall it's a solid game that should be played, but unless you're really big into the retro arcade grinding scene, I wouldn't drop more than 8 bucks on it.  If it's on sale for 5 or less, by all means grab it.Overall, I'd give it a 7.5/10"

I love the abundance of masks, all leading to different styles of play, from throwing guns to kill people instead of shooting them, which can alert others, to punching a dog leaping at your throat and crushing its skull in, this game is a beautiful, albeit violent gaming experience, which I highly recommend."
,Recommended,219150,14672119,"Posted: 26 February, 2015",all,Mevvallanneous Bob,"I have to say, Hotline Miami is probably the most fun I've had with a game of this scale in a very long time. From its gritty story, stylish visuals, awesome music, and absurdly fun gameplay mechanics, it'd be quite a loss to not experience the game for yourself. So go play it when you get a chance!Story: You're a man who's out to, uhh... ""clean up"" the city. And you do a mighty fine job of it.Visuals: It's a top-down perspective, and there are a lot of crazy glowing neon backgrounds. The stages themselves are mostly building interiors or urban settings, reflecting a bit of how you'd think the underworld of Florida looked circa the 1980s. I would say that it fits the narrative of the game well, and it sure didn't detract from it.Audio: While there's not too many sound effects that you'll be focusing on (gunshots, stab/slice sounds, doors opening, wood cracking), the music stands out quite a bit, as it melds with the 1980's ""neon and crazy"" visuals that are present throughout the game. Moreover, the music is just plain nice to listen to by itself if you're into it!Controls: While the controls may take some getting used to (I use a 360 gamepad for games when it's available), that's exactly the ticket. You get used to them FAST. You use one stick to move, one to aim your character since you can face 360 degrees, you have a button to pick up and throw items, a button to fire the weapons, and you can click the sticks to lock on. As stated earlier, by principle of playing the game, you learn the ins and outs of the controls fast.Gameplay: The gameplay is divided into two different kinds of segments. Smaller ""story"" type segments where you learn a little more about what's going on, and just outright ""game"" segments, where you run about doing all sorts of stuff. You control a man wearing masks, and your goal is to usually clear a floor of a bunch of enemies by taking them out by any means necessary. Your score rolls higher if you use a lot of different types of kills. You can go from punching a guy, throwing a knife, shooting a gun, THROWING the gun, and a bunch of other crazy stuff to make the process flow a lot smoother. By the end of each mission, you're tasked with bailing out of where you are and taking off. On the other side, your character can generally only take one hit of damage before dying. You can, however, restart a mission as many times you need to.Difficulty: While the game was much harder when I first played it a while back, it did get a little less absurd the more I played. I guess it has a decent enough curve, but I guess there are some people who would find it very difficult. So to be fair, I'll say it's moderately difficult. The one-hit deaths may be a factor that makes the game difficult for some, but you do get checkpoints in levels so that you can get back to where you were faster.Fun Factor: Quite a fun game. There are times where the game gets a bit difficult, like a certain mission towards the end of the game. But in its occasional harsh difficulty, it still managed to do is be fun. There's just an odd joy in playing as a fragile human blender running around taking out a bunch of mobsters with extreme prejudice. Even when it gets to the point where you'd think they're starting to use your own strategies against you. For me, fun is a value in games that I seek out beyond presentation, pretention, and theory. Because pretending you're having fun is just not a way to spend your time.Replayability: I'd say it's got quite the replay value. While the story campaign has a definite ending, you can always go back to earlier played chapters and just have at it. You may unlock something new in the process or find something you didn't see before. O you can take on the chapter in a more (or less) efficient way than you did the first time. You can go as unnoticed as you possibly can, or you can take on the mission guns (or throwing items) blazing. Considering how addictive the game can get, it's pretty easy to see why anyone would go back to play it again! You can even just go back and play it for absolutely no reason at all; you're bound to have some fun.Would I recommend? - Yes.To who? - Those who like relatively fast-paced action games.Any possible detractions? - If you don't like ridiculous, pixelated violence, this game may not a little outside of your comfort zone. For anyone else, I really can't say there's anything negative to take away from the experience.Numbered Score - ?/10 - In my own personal system of numbered ratings, a ""?"" is given to a game I put in the realm of ""To give it any number would be a disservice to myself and its creators."" While opinions definitely vary on how good a game is or is not, the ""?"" is merely my sign of respect."

You won;t regret it."
,Recommended,219150,5139256,"Posted: 26 December, 2012",all,Welcome To The Geese Fields,"To put it simply; Hotline Miami is an experience unlike any other.From the very beginning, the game does not waste time in pulling the player in. The tutorial gets straight to the point, it doesn't hold your hand and tell you everything there is to know, but it also doesn't leave you blind when going in.From there on, the game only gets keeps on rolling without putting on the brakes. The player is introduced to an atmosphere unlike any other. While there are games on the market that get the vibe of the 80's, it's hard to say if there any that can match the fantastic soundtrack of Hotline Miami that really makes it almost representative of what the 80's vibe is. On top of that, the soundtrack fits so well with the neon colored pixelated environment that contains so much detail.The story is also an experience quite unlike any other. There's a large amount of mystery and allusion that keeps things interesting. Unlike most other games who force the player to make moral choices in order to question themselves, Hotline Miami is direct with making the player question their own motives without forcing them into obviously wrong and obviously right choices. Even after multiple playthroughs it can be hard to say if you fully understand the story. I found that the tutorial had some very sneaky allusions to parts later in the game, it's not often that a game can manage to hide something like an important part of the story within its own tutorial and keep the player from noticing.Beyond the story and atmosphere that make the game so memorable and unique is its gameplay. While many games have done the top-down perspective, none do it like Hotline Miami. Hotline Miami doesn't drop the player into a horde of enemies with a machinegun in hand and a single square room to strafe in, it drops the player into an almost sandbox style level littered with weapons and enemies. To make things a bit more challenging than usual, the player doesn't have a healthbar or a number of lives, one hit kills the player, but they can restart the floor/level over as much as they like. This means the player can take things slow and plan them out to stay alive, or go full-on psycho and try to rush every enemy and adapt on the fly.Before each level, the player can also equip a mask that can change the flow of gameplay entirely. Some simply allow the player to move a little faster, while others change larger aspects like being able to kill an enemy by smashing them with a door. There's a large variety of ways to approach each level, with the masks being able to help with a certain playstyle of force the player into another playstyle, and the variety of weapons that can make the player go from a silent assassin taking out enemies one by one, to a raging lunatic cracking skulls and spreading neon red all over the level.Hotline Miami may not be the lengthiest game, the most challenging game, or the most graphically impressive game, but with it's large variety of ways to play the game, fantastic soundtrack, and mysterious story, it's brought me back for more replays than most triple A games I've played. Overall, Hotline Miami is an amazing game, and if you haven't tried it yet, you're missing out on one of the most entertaining and unique gaming-experiences there is."
76561198045160555,Recommended,219150,13743418,"Posted: 31 December, 2014",all,Lizardheart,"Bought it for Payday 2Stayed for the gameplay.That's how I'd sum up my experience with the game.However, it isn't without fault. First and foremost, the menu music almost made me shut off the game as soon as it started. Most of the early game just has painful ""music"" at the start but it gets much better in the firefights. Second is that god forsaken ""stealth"" level where you have to purely trial and error against hospital staff that would make the Metal Gear Solid guards out of a job and if THAT wasn't annoying enough, your character is a bumbling drunkard in it. It just feels sloppy and not befitting of the game. Finally, I dislike the ""side storyline"" where you play as the biker guy. Yeah, it's a cute gimmick but it seems they went out of their way to make them easy just to play a guy with throwing knives. All this and I wish it were longer (but I got it for a buck. Not complaining about that in the slightest).Now, onto why I enjoyed the game: it's a very fast paced shooter, It's very fair in its difficulty where there were few times I could blame the game for my deaths (there is the occurance where an enemy shoots you from off screen since windows seem to magnify their vision but I digress). It's a little trial and error based but you really want to rack up the combo count and do it in as stylish of a manner as possible and the game rewards you for doing just that. Like someone mentioned in the comments before me, this game is a very good game if you just wanna kill people... a lot of people for that matter.To sum this review up, if you can get this game for cheap, as I did, jump at the chance to get it.

It is very fast-paced and killing things in this game is very satisfying (as psychotic as that might seem after playing it). But it has this one teeth-grindingly annoying flaw: EVERYTHING KILLS YOU WAY TOO FAST. Often times I found myself wondering ""What the hell just happened? How did that guy kill me without even showing that he swung his weapon or even noticed me?"" because the game is simply TOO fast-paced a lot of the time. Enemies have eyes in the backs of their heads and can swivel a 180 in less than a milisecond to snipe you with aimbot-like accuracy before you even have the time to say ""Oops"" like the slow dumbass this game makes you feel like you are. The hit detection can also be ball-bustingly picky sometimes, and that can be a real hassle in a game where using guns is frowned upon due to their loudness. A lot of the time I'd be right next to a guy, swing my knife only to realize that he's still standing there, and has already positioned a load of buckshot at a point where it can penetrate my cerebral cortex. Point is, I found myself getting♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥a lot more than actually having fun with this game due to its Contra hard difficulty that requires the reflexes of a cyberneic ninja to actually get past. The story's great if you can do that, though. Overall, buy this game if you're a decently hardcore gamer with a taste for violence and fast reflexes."

Perhaps it is its soundtrack, it doesn't use really known songs or artist, but it is neither needed, can't imagine game with other soundtrack. Maybe it is for the really good amount of weapons you can use, from a Uzi to a katana, or the possibility of using a mask, which will give you a special power (going faster, killing with hands, more time for combos...). Could be for the chance of bursting the head of the enemies while they are in the floor. Or maybe it is 'cause the graphichs, those retro graphics in a era of ""the more realistic is the game, the better"" gives to the game additional points."

Other people might say this game is repetitive but it's not, really. You get rewarded for doing different types of killing... Sounds bad, I know.There's no other word to put it. What's frequent in this game is.. you die... a lot. That's normal considering the difficulty of this game. When you get killed by an enemy, you start again where you spawned. It's kind of hard, especially in the later levels. In this game, you start off in the tutorial as most games do. After that, you start the level and you then put on a mask. You then kill the Russians in the building either by beating them up or using a weapon to kill them in one hit. That's kind of what you do in the game. In some levels, there are bosses which you need to kill with the weapons you pick up either a gun or a melee weapon. As you progress through the game, you collect more masks and weapons. The masks give you special abilities but the first one you receive doesn't give you any type of special ability whatsoever.In my opinion, this game is pretty awesome and you should buy it whether or not its on sale. I can't wait for Hotline Miami 2. I hope that game is as good as the first one. Unlike my older reviews, I'm not going to give a number rating on this. Instead, I'm going to say that it is awesome.

So maybe casual gamers and people, who get easily frustrated, won't have that much fun.So my conclusion on Hotline Miami is that I as an indie game-lover with a soft spot for comicbook-violence, Art House movies and confusing things in general had an awesome time playing the game and if you can identify yourself with one of these things, you should probably give it a shot."

The enemy AI can be a little weird sometimes but as a whole it was an enjoyable play with an engaging soundtrack. Worth the price of admission.

The nightmare begins in a dingy 1989 Miami apartment, as you listen to the first in a long line of mysterious messages left on your answering machine. For whatever reason, you feel compelled to do as you're told, a task that usually involves brutally murdering dozens of armed gunmen with hair triggers. Pressing on in a search for answers only further blurs the lines between reality and rampant psychosis, and you're left wondering which possibility is the least horrifying. Vigilante gone overboard? Contract killer? Maybe you're just a delivery driver losing himself in increasingly improbable power fantasies. Maybe it doesn't matter. Maybe you don't care.The game presents an impressive array of weapons and animal masks, each augmenting your abilities or changing the gameplay in some way. It's more of a twitchy, reflex-based puzzler than a mindless rampage, and a single misstep will lead to a messy death at the hands of your adrenaline-fueled enemies. However, any feelings of frustration that might arise are quickly washed away in a tsunami of 16bit blood and gore, and the fast-paced, addictive gameplay will have you hitting the ""retry"" button out of pure reflex.The soundtrack fits the game like a glass slipper, ghosts of acid-washed synthesizers and contemporary electronica comprising one of the best video game soundtracks you'll ever hear.""I think our time is up... But we'll meet again.Before you go, here's four questions to ponder.Question number one:Do you like hurting other people?Question number two:Who is leaving messages on your answering machine?Question number three:Where are you right now?And the final question:Why are we having this conversation?That's all for now.

What I was not expecting was the best video game soundtrack (that I have personally heard), ridiculously challenging and addictive gameplay, and an intriguing, yet vague story.This is an action game through and through but something about it feels like so much more. It is one of the rare games that proves that video games can be and are an art form. I would go into more detail about the game play but there is no need. It is a fast paced, violent, top down shooter, however it is tastefully done. The only con about this game is it's length. I finished the main story line plus bonus missions in about 6 hours of gameplay. There is some replay draw but not a game you are going to play for hours and hours day after day. But do not let that deter you from buying this game. Overall it is an incredible game and worthy of praise. I await the sequel with high anticipation"
,Recommended,219150,12858687,"Posted: 9 November, 2014",all,ShinyMcShine,"Dennaton Games released this little indie gem in 2012. Ultra-violence through pixel art, this game puts players in the role of a nameless anti-hero who receives strange phone calls directing him to commit unspeakable acts of graphic violence. Set in 1989 Miami, the techno soundtrack thumps away in a monotonous throbbing pulse as a perfect soundtrack to the extreme violence and chaos. The colours are all hypnotic 80's vibrant fluro reds, pinks and greens and fit with the time period perfectly. There's a real sense of uneasiness about this game as you converse with faceless people in pig and horse masks, asking you questions like, ""Do you enjoy hurting people?"". The games difficultly harkens back to the old days of brutally hard Sega and Nes titles where one hit means you're dead, that's it, start the level again. There's an achievement for dying 1,000 times, I hit it at just over 5 hours (mind you I also hit the achievement around the same time for killing 1989 enemies so it's balanced out). The graphics are delightfully retro pixel art that beautifully complements the disturbing nature of the games themes. Proof that you don't need big budgets and high end processing power to deliver a truly enjoyable and thought provoking gaming experience."

Hotline Miami is by far one of the best games I have ever played and even though some parts may feel repetetive and tedious, if you get past that really hard part you are stuck on it's smooth sailing back onto the storyline.This game proves that games do not need high quality super fancy graphics, all they need is a good plot and the ability to keep the player on the edge of their seat.The only thing I think would be even more awesome is if it was a bit longer, but the game is still awesome as it is.BUY THIS GAME."

Dispite it being super short  the fact that there are hight scores, collectibles, and different styes yo play with certanly will extend the game.The way the levels are made in such a way that it makes you ""step out of your comfort zone"" to make you  think differently in certain situations never making a level feel repetitive and dull.

Made by two people from Sweden, this gem of a game is something to think about. It's a top-down f*ck'em up, where you at the beginning of a level don an animal mask, and then go on a bloodthirsty rampage, murdering anyone and everyone you see. Baseball bat, shotgun, a pair of scissors, a brick, or even a katana. Whatever you find you can use to kill.Let me tell you one of the reasons why it's so good. *ahem* Every enemy in the game, (bar a very few exceptions,) can be killed in one hit from anything. Gun, melee or throwing, it's deadly.Now that I've told you this, you might think it's very easy.IT ISN'T.You see, every enemy dies in one hit from everything, but SO DO YOU. One hit from anything. A lucky glance from a mobster's golf club? Dead. A punch in the face from a negro thug? Dead. A single shot from any kind of gun? Dead.WHATEVER IT IS, IF IT HITS, IT KILLS YOU.Now, let's say you've gotten your hands on Hotline Miami, and then you think that you should play methodically, like: ""Yes, attack through here. Strangle Guard A, take his gun, wait 2,5 seconds, fling open the door and knock out Guard B, shoot Guard C, and-"" Looks like you forgot about that guard dog which is trained very well to rip out your jugular.That didn't work.Then you're dead. Then you make a noise something like ""GRRARL"", hit R, and this time just run in swinging a katana wildly and erratically until everything else stops moving.That does work.Essentially, what Hotline Miami does is throw you to the ground and begins to stomp on your chest until you learn to grab the foot and twist it.All the a kick♥♥♥♥♥soundtrack of synth and house music that thunders wildly in the background.It's great. It's fantastic. It's brutal and savage.And I wouldn't have it any other way."

The soundtrack is amazing, arguably the best soundtrack of any game I've played. While not for everyone, the bounding bass provided by many of the soundtracks fits the gameplay perfectly.

,Recommended,219150,3262245,"Posted: 26 March, 2013",all,jc helmet,"In case you’re not aware of what Hotline Miami is, let me bring you up to speed. It’s a top-down, ultra-violent, retro-styled beat-em-up/shooter set in 1989 in which you kill people. Lots of people. And it is brilliant.Miami presents an aesthetic so masterfully crafted I want to cry out of pure joy. Neon, garish, nauseating, eye-catching, and unsteady— beautiful and ugly at the same time, much like the rest of the game. It effortlessly references the era it’s set in, but without feeling trite and cliche. As someone who loves the setting, it was a joy to hop into a DeLorean-esque car, go and kill white-suited mobsters, and then stop off at a VHS store afterwards. The little touches here and there add to a real sense of atmosphere. Top all of this with the ludicrously good, chill-inducing soundtrack and it’s fantastic.Hotline Miami’s gameplay is also brilliant. For starters, your character is incredibly fragile. After one hit from a baseball bat or a bullet or two, you are out for the count. In any other game, this would be a huge problem. But it’s a key part of Miami’s design. The ‘R’ key restarts the level instantaneously, and you’re back to where you started. No load screens, no downtime. This works in the game’s favor, because Miami isn’t easy. It starts off relatively simple as you get a grasp of the confusing and trippy world you’ve been thrust into—one or two enemies here or there, no problem. Pretty soon after that though, you’re presented with sprawling neon complexes swarming with white-suited goons wielding shotguns and golf clubs. And you just know they are as high as you are.Killing in Miami—something you’ll be doing a lot of—is fast and visceral. it takes you just as long to kill your adversaries as it does for them to kill you. And with each blow, candy-red blood splatters all over the purple carpet and off-white walls, staining the level with your deeds. Their skulls break into pieces, their pixellated guts spilling onto the floor. In Miami, the bodies don’t fade away.The gameplay provides a very special breed of tension and strategy, mixed with sheer reckless abandon. You move fast, kill fast, and get killed fast. The game works like a sort of demented puzzle as you try again and again to figure out the right lightning-fast combination of murder to get you to the end without being blown apart and seeing the contents of your skull paint the floors.discretion is of essenceThe narrative in Hotline Miami is sparse, but intriguing. I won’t spoil it, but it perfectly frames and sets up the gameplay and atmosphere. It is told jarringly and vaguely, often out of order. It contributes to the overall unease and confusion you get from playing the game. It’s interesting without being overbearing, and not too distracting from the killing.But one thing that is never explained is why you are committing all these killings. And that’s intentional. Miami sets you on this path and you follow it, because that’s what you do. You’re playing the game. But after every level, youare given a few minutes of narrative downtime(remember the VHS store and the pizza shop?) to reflect upon your deeds. And this is where Miami starts to step out of the realm of a good game and becomes a work of art. What exactly it all means is up to you to decide, and I won’t go too much into that.Miami is not without its problems. Glitches abound, and the game has a few bad boss fights. This doesn’t detract at all, in my mind. It is still a game you should play. It’s an experience you should have. I played through Miami with the volume up all the way, fingers frantically clicking, foot tapping uncontrollably, twitching nervously, with a huge grin on my face.It’s sickening, revolting, garish, beautiful, vibrant, smart, fast, chilling, exciting, anxious, and fun. Also it’s just really, really cool. Pick it up if you haven’t. Play it."

The graphics are old-style and pixelly but that only serves to exaggerate its bloodiness. There isn't much in ways of a story of course, but who cares? You play a punk who is constantly called to murder mooks by the dozen as bloodily as possible. The game rewards you with points for boldness and variety in the ways you choose to dispose of your hapless victims and that's about it. The game also comes with a great soundtrack which enhances the retro atmosphere even further.One thing you need to know about this game is that you will die... a LOT!!! A byproduct of being as vulnerable as your enemies, a fact I like, coupled with somewhat clunky controls. Sometimes it can be frustrating because then you'll have to repeat the level.

The game is straight outta’ the classic console generations, utilizing the technology limitations to hone its scope to core mechanics and maximizing immersion through colorful aesthetic and sound. Honestly, these are the goals of seemingly infinite indie titles that pop up like weeds uncontrollably, and like the theories of the concept of “infinite” dictate; all possibilities will occur, so therefore eventually we get a title that fires on all cylinders. Hotline Miami does this by conquering the scale and scope for the asking price yielding a worthwhile product. The gameplay consists of aerial controlled murder sprees with viciously quick shooting and melee mixed with a flavor of stealth execution. It is tough as nails, but short levels and fast respawns mean you’re just a few quick button combinations away from getting past that damned section that keeps killing you (and the rage of your own failure ruminates as you embody the anger that fuels this violence and you become one with the murderer…Too real?

Also the crazy colors give me horrible headaches which are followed by profuse vomiting. It is difficult to become aroused, when surrounded by blood and vomit. I also feel like the love story between the protagonist and the hobo was under-utilized. The entire beginning of the game focuses on the love triangle between the our masked hero, the hobo and the animal masks. But, the hobo is killed far too quickly in the game, leaving the protangonist with the animal masks, before the hobo can profess his love to our hero.

The violence is overwhelming but satisfying. If your are into arcade-like, hyper-violent, 80's style games, then this is for you. However, if you are also looking for a game whose story will confuse you like none other yet leave you pondering, then I highly advise that you try this game.

The graphics seem very basic and options menu is appalling. the have improved it with a options window before starting the game but still is quite inconvienant compared to todays options and resoulutions. But the art style is quite nice. It seems to add a drugged or nightclub kind of feeling with the background constantly changing colours.The main meat of this game though is the really quick insta-kill combat. You are thrown into a level with no weapons, a mask, an objective and a Delorean. expect to die. Alot. You do kill enemies in one shot, but they do too.

First off let me address the difficulty of the game, it's hard, well that is until you get the hand of it.  Just like Souls games its all about timing, pattern recognition and timing once you get all that down the game is a blast.>Shoot five russian mobsters with a six shot shotgun>Sixth mobster comes hustling around the corner holding a pipe>realize you're out of ammo due to a missed shot earlier>about to get head smashed>throw gun at him knocking him to the ground>walk over and kneel down over him>grab head his head and stark smashing it against the tile floor of an 80's night club>strobe lights cause the fresh blood to glisen off the flood>seems like deranged modern art>kill moreThe game is fun and fast past, the music is an amazing synth retrowave and while playing it it made me think of various movies I've enjoyed over the years.  ""Old Boy"", ""Drive"", ""Only God Forgives"" and various other retro throw back ultra violence flicks that center around inventive scences of ultra violence.   I wanted to recreated the hammer scence from ""Old Boy"" (Asian version) and I'll be damned if I didn't almost do it to a T. Just smashing 10 modsters in a halway as they alll rush me and watching the blood splatter and the bodies fall limp to the ground made me feel so F'n cool while playing this game.

You play as a killer in the late 1980's who receives his targets via a phone calls on the 'Hotline Miami'. The game itself plays as a top-down brawler/shooter, not unlike the early GTA1 or Dreamweb, together with the respective visual asthetic. Every hit can kill the enemy, as well as yourself, and that's where the game becomes more of a puzzle where the engagement of a room has to be carefully planned and executed, similar to titles like Super Meat Boy. The story is much deeper than it appears at first glance and despite being a short 5 hour title, might make you replay the game just to fill in the blanks.

Put shortly, it is amongst the favorite I've ever played.Hotline Miami may seem to be a murder simulator for demented people...actually that's exactly what it is.  The old-school style graphics add the flair that indie games often need to distinguish themselves.  The hyper-violence presented in the title sharply contrasts the pixelated people and blood.  It perfectly demonstrates the theme of murder being so trivialized.  Without giving any spoilers, more games need to marry the visual representation with the story being told.And yet Hotline Miami also brings the bacon in terms of gameplay as well.  Melee weopons produce no sound, and killing with enemies won't alert other guards within an earshot.  Everything is presented in a top down view, allowing for real planning and tactics.  Do not judge straight direct capture footage and call this game random chaos; each and every move must be calculated to get out of the level successful, outside of the few times that guns provide that X-Factor.Speaking of which, remember the silence of melee?  Well, guns do make noise.Though going in guns blazing is often a one way ticket to a restart, the times when it actually works out produce some of the most frantically satisfying gameplay in any digital medium, full stop.I could continue on for hours about the abundance of content Hotline Miami packs, or the time, ""this incredible play happened"", or the moments of ""ooooh's"" and ""ahhhh's"" that naturally arise from playing this game with friends.  When put shortly, do not hesitate to buy the game.  As one of my first purchases on steam nearly a year ago, I can honestly say that I still come back to don a mask, grab a bat, and get ready for some organized carnage."

The story is great you play as Jacket you don't know who or where you are you walk in a room and your surrounded by 3 people all wearing an animal mask: a horse, a rooster and a owl, they all seem to know or heared about you and they know a lot about you. oke if that isn't a great beginning of a great game then i don't know what is well there are of course better beginnings in games but that aside for a moment. The soundtrack really fits the game for some reason its amazing the creators knew what they we're doing and they did a great job. The gameplay is solid you can go in guns blazing and probably end up dying or go sneaky and tactical and still die a lot but wait why do you die a lot? well because thats how hard it is its 1 shot/hit (2/3/4 if you're wearing a certain mask) and your dead. now i found 1 bug it was kind of annoying because i had to redo almost the entire level but lets just say its a bit like Dark Souls, once you know what you're doing its like riding a bike.+Great yet bit confusing story+Killer soundtrack+Nice gore factor you got there+Solid gameplay-An annoying bug or twoFinal verdict: Stop! hammer time! 9/10"

You play as an unnamed character that begins to receive mysterious phone calls from an unknown source. The calls simply tell you to go to a location and kill the people there (they happen to be Russian mobsters), and for whatever inexplicable reason, you listen.This of course is the real beauty of the game, the top down, ultra-violent action. Once you show up at a location it’s you, your enemies, and the various weapons you have at your murderous disposal: fists, baseball bats, crowbars, knives, and an assortment of different guns. You die in one hit, and in most cases so do your enemies. This causes the game to often turn into a frantic adrenaline fueled rush of bullets and blood.This means you will die a lot. You must clear stages in one life, dying will force you to restart the stage. Stages are not very long, so a successful run will go quickly, but the amount of dying will prolong your completion time. Despite the number of deaths you will incur, the game never feels very difficult, though that may be more the quick and short nature of the stages obfuscating the difficulty.That said, things are not always a mad rush towards carnage. Success will require you to tactically plan how to eliminate all your foes. A gun will allow you to kill someone from a distance, but the noise of the gunshot will attract more enemies, who may be packing heat of their own. A quick rush towards them with a crowbar will kill them silently, but they may notice you and retaliate before you manage to bash their skull in. Or maybe you should slam that door into the other bloke in the room below you first and worry about this chap later. This balance of planning, sneaking around, and quick action helps make the game very enjoyable.A few quick criticisms though, the game does not support properly support higher resolutions, as they will either feature black bars on the top and bottom and/or sides, or not display correctly at all. (The highest I could get it to run was at 1280 x 720, which still had black bars on the top and bottom. For reference, my monitor is 1920 x 1080). Second, the options lack any sort of things to tweak, so if you want to remap the controls, you’re out of luck. Thankfully, the default controls work pretty well, but it’s still pretty lame that you can’t change them even you want to. Third, and this pertains to the gameplay itself, while the levels themselves are great fun, the boss fights aren’t up to par, and well, frankly the boss fights suck. Which is a shame considering how much fun the levels themselves are to play.All said and done though, Hotline Miami is a blast to play, and well worth your money. Go ahead, answer the phone and get to killing some mobsters."

The 16 bit style mixed with the amazing control and gore make this a classic for gamers who want a challenge with a reward.Gameplay: In Hotline Miami movement is key, which is why it is so fluent. You are Bruce Lee on a skateboard and if you stop moving then you get torn to ribbons by gun fire and golf clubs. The controls are so great that death is your fault, not the games.Other fun!: The music is extraordinary in how good it is. The variety of weapons at your disposal make every level intresting to say the least. This can also be said about the mask system and all the perks available to you.No game i've seen comes close to how good Hotline Miami is.

There are not lot of games with style like this. ;-)Story is not too long, but it is enjoyable and interesting. As well, this game at first will be hard af, but when you learn how to do thing around it remains easier and more exciting.If you have fast reaction, you have bigger chance to do 'things' faster, but still, you can go stealth and even be a 'Ghost'. For some masks (aka. characters) have weapon at the begining of the mission.One BIG tip for all new players - Read Text!Almost all cool things in this game are told by characters or written somewhere, so pay attention to details.Oh, and one more thing... do not rush your game. At the begining read all carefully, when you get to higher levels and have got a little expirience then you can rush up and just smash the faces. :Owl:Tip for SHOOTERS: Do not spray! You have ONLY one clip for each fire-arm, so do not waste it. If you 'tap', you have better chance to kill, instead of being killed.And yeah, I suggest to choose Your favorite mask. Read descriptions and try in-game.Have a nice killing time, enjoy the game!speedpuppy"

For instance, if you wear the Tony the Tiger mask, you have faster executions, while George the Giraffe allows you to see farther. They're a neat companion to the combat system, which initially sees you taking down enemies with your fists and with a selection of melee weapons that you pick up, such as baseball bats, iron bars, knives, and swords.Controls : 6At first,i was like WHAT THE HELL.HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO PLAY LIKE THIS.the controls can be tough.difficult as hell.but after an hour of playing,you will find the interesting,trust me.Story : 9People call you Jacket.The story takes place in April 1989.You find yourself standing in a room.you go forward,and you see 3 masked people.The one on the left wears a horse mask,being as polite as possible.The one on the right is being mean and tells you to leave.The one in the middle is the most human like,telling you that he knows you,he knows your past,and your future.Was That real? after leaving the room,you find yourself in an apartment.The phone rings,he gives you a specific address,and you go there with your car and slaughter everyone.You say that you do all those stuff for your killed girlfriend.Is this true?Or you start enjoying it?Sound : 10Hotline Miami,got probably the best soundtracks in indie game history by far.DIIIIIIIIIIIIISCO.Random FactSomething that made my jaw fall,was,that the designer of Hotline Miami,Jonatan Söderström,logged into The♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥with the username ""cactus69"",and provided instructions to people who illegally downloaded the game,because,as he said,some people cant afford.Also,when he got questioned by piracy issues from EuroGamer,Graeme Struthers of Devolver Digital said ""He (Söderström) just felt he didn't want people playing the buggy version of his game however they got it. He wanted them to get the patch. He basically said, 'I'm not going to criticise this, it's a fact of life. It would be nice if guys could find it within themselves to pay for it, but that's the world I'm in, so you know, you just have to take it for what it is.' It has been torrented to such a staggering level, and given the file size of it, I mean, you can't really be surprised, right? You could pass this thing around on the world's smallest memory stick.

Without a doubt, Hotline Miami is one of the best games released in recent years.The game's style of play is the not entirely uncommon twitch-shooter, it keeps the player on edge, and often in tears due to the amount of restarts you'll have to suffer through - often all of your own fault; the game has true difficulty, rather than a lot of artificial numbers being stacked against the player. Both the protagonist and the antagonists (for the most part) die in one hit - so expect to witness your gorey demise fairly often - fortunately, the game wastes no time in allowing you to jump directly back into the action.And the game /is/ gorey - coupled with its hypnotic techno soundtrack consistently blaring in the background, it puts the player in an almost trance-like state. After completing each 'assignment,' you're forced to walk back through the massacre that you've brought about, and it's an awesome, terrible spectacle - many of the deaths and kill animations in this game are absurdly violent, which just adds to its dark charm.It plays out almost like a horror game - for it is horrific, the murders that you'll commit in this game, and that's pressed only further by the storyline itself.While the gameplay, the soundtrack, and the bright lights are often the main focus of the game, the storyline was my personal favorite part - it's one of the trippiest, most well-executed ones I've had the pleasure of playing through, and it's something best discovered by yourself.For the asking price of 10$, Hotline Miami is something that belongs in every gamer's collection."

From the menu music to the loading screen jams, I completely adore the OST for this game. Secondly the layout of the levels (excluding the hospital level, I didn't really like that level layout) are brilliantly designed to create a mix of riveting, fast-paced shooting and a unique puzzle mechanic when it comes to play execution. Lastily, the story in it's own right isn't amazing, yet it delivers a good tie in to the gameplay and makes it feel like it actually matters; This in despite that I've died countless times which may feel like the kills and deaths are meanigless, but not really to be honest.

But it is not just any shooter, it is a top-down speed course that leaves marginal room for error. While it is possible to take things on bit by bit, the objective is to get through the floors of a building by killing everybody as quickly as possible to accumulate a much higher score. This can take some getting used to, but it is not hard to find yourself ""practicing"" for a decent amount of your day if you don't pace yourself. While it is very satisfying to run through the gore-infested levels, frustration will set in at some point when you kill everybody on the floor you've spent a half hour trying to complete besides the guy who runs up and one-hits you with a bat.I would (and already did) recommend this game. Great gameplay, arguably replayable, interesting graphics and music, and a confusing but somewhat interesting story. 8/10"

It might be a little short but it has pretty good replay value because you want to do the levels even faster, even better, even bolder. The amount of weapons isn't as good as it looks with al the unlockable weapons. It has some standard bi=ut really good weapons like a machine gun, different shotguns etc. Some really good enviromental weapons are also present like boiling water.The story is disturbing but quite good.Too bad that the level editor is in Hotline miami 2. So if you want that, maybe check out 2. I haven't played it, so don't quote me on that.In summary:Good game, cheap, replay value, no level editor :( (HM2)"

The game is very difficult but here is my reason why this game deserves a thumbs up.Hotline Miami is one of those games out there that has brutal gory blood in it but that isnt why i like it.I like hotline miami because the storyline is just great. Hotline miami's storyline is about a person who goes out on a rampage to kill members of the russian mafia.(spoiler alert dont read unless you have completed the game)So the russian mafia kills the persons girlfriend and then jacket goes out on a rampage killing cops and the russian mafia.Then,you find the leader of the russian mafia then you kill him .(ok no spoilers ahead now)Hotline Miami is amazing on what it has to offer and it really entertained me well.If you got 10 bucks on steam then buy this. it is a masterpiece."

,Recommended,219150,8816949,"Posted: 23 January, 2014",all,Krow,"I'd recommend this game for the soundtrack alone, it's that full of actual, concentrated and without any added sugar, win.Chiptune (8-bit) old school tunes with a hint of 80's splashed all over it, from various artists so as to keep it all fresh.Each track  adds to the atmosphere of the game brilliantly and they really set the tone of your progress and mass confusion as you delve deeper into the plot with each level.The gameplay itself takes me back to the old school years of playing ""True Lies"" on my SNES, similar birds eye top view of a level, fast action and a ruthless difficulty level punishing your slightest mistake with instant death and forcing a level restart, though enemies go down just as fast as you do.It's rewarding however to get that perfect run through a level, to react on the fly for when an enemy comes barging through a door rather than being down the corridor where he was seen on your last playthrough.The controls are smooth and responsive, WASD for the movement and MOUSE for looking and aiming in the direction of the cursor, dozens of melee (axes, katanas etc), ranged (uzis, magnums etc) and thrown weapons (darts, bricks etc).The inclusion of masks to collect and select before the start of each level add an interesting angle as to how a level can be played. Do you want to start with a knife or have guard dogs ignore you entirely? Did you want to survive that one extra bullet wound or have your fists as lethal as a baseball bat?It's a great indie game, easy to jump into and learn and challenging to master, plenty of hours to keep you busy for a few nights with plenty of replayability in the form of high scores with which to unlock new masks and weapons.Thumbs up. Now go get it, do eeeeet!"

,Recommended,219150,8373609,"Posted: 28 December, 2013",all,Yawzheek,"Paid $2 for this game on sale, and after 11 or so hours, I can only conclude it was WELL worth the money. Even at full price it would still have been worth the money. The game is gritty, colorful, action packed, and has a nice trace of murder-puzzle about it, and I LOVED it.There is a certain charm about this game, even if it's based on finding fast and dreadful ways to bring an end to human life, and that charm is based solely on the action. You will die. A lot. You will be killed by the control system, a somewhat random AI response time, and unforseen scripted events, but unlike any other game, rather than dwell on it before sending you to a loading screen, you push a single button and you're right back in it giving it another go. The checkpoint system - despite a few flaws - is really the icing on this homicide cake. It was designed solely to keep the action flowing without pause. It encourages you to try new things, and though some of the areas are complex enough to slightly discourage that practice, none of them are so large or unforgiving that you couldn't reclaim your progress within minutes. This is a fast-paced, sweaty-palm experience.The soundtrack is great. It's appropriate for an 80's themed game. While there are only about 4 tracks that repeat every mission, there's typically enough going on that you don't really notice once the chapter opening screen passes. The other sounds are just good and gritty: the sound of a bat or fist hitting a skull, a gunshot, etc. There isn't a large need for 1000 sound effects, so there isn't much they can mess up, and luckily they didn't.Gameplay is fast and frantic. It's not that the game discourages setting up a well thought out plan, but there isn't usually a need for it, and very rarely do things go according to plan. Maybe a first play might warrant scouting the area, but after that you're largely expected to move, move, MOVE. The controls take some time to get used to, and if you play with a gamepad I would highly advise you to swap triggers and bumpers, but it still flows together nicely. There are a few instances where the pace and controls will cause a few deaths, but again, death is a natural part of this title, so it's easy to look past these issues.The story is bonkers and nonsensical, some of the boss fights are a bit annoying, and the inclusion of a forced-stealth area later on in the game is a real headscratcher, but other than these minor issues, the game is very solid. Having an alternate ending, collectible masks and weapons that can DRASTICALLY alter gameplay, and leaderboards also encourages multiple playthroughs. For the price of admission, you're going to get quite a bit of time from this title. Pick it up, get psyched, and go to work!"

With a story that leaves you sick to your stomach and a system of action that leaves you feeling like a golden god, this game is a must have.  You die with one hit from any weapon which adds a perfect level of challenge and uniqueness to this action game.  Often you have to abondon any sense of strategy for balls-out badassary, rushing into a huge group of enemies knowing there's a 99% chance you'll get massacred.  But it's alright if you die a lot.  F*ck, die 1000x, there's an achievement for that!  The musik is sublime.  The atmosphere beautifully trippy.This game somehow snuck into my favorite games of all time list.
