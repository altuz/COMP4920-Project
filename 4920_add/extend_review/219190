You sucked me in late at night with your pretty colors, challenging gameplay, and awesome upgrades. I loved you until I loaded what I thought was my save with my high score I was working on to find me back at an earlier level 3000,000 short of what I was. For now I must give you up because I am hurt and sad but will comeback one day to complete my challenge of moving up the leaderboards.Ultratron is a fantastic old school style twin stick shooter from the guys at puppygames. They also made other great titles like Revenge of The Titans and Titan Attacks. Your mission is to avenge the human race by killing the titans.You do this as a little robot who you can upgrade by earning money which is dropped when titans die. Upgrades come in the form of the power of your gun, adding little pets who each have a different weapon, and defensive abilities like an EMP shock when you get hit. To keep these upgrades you have to get past a checkpoint which is every ten levels and a boss.Gameplay is best done with a controller in my opinion since one joystick controls movement and the other controls your gun. Each stage is done in a somewhat oval shaped stage where a variety of titans appear to bring a stop to your destruction. Each time a titan is killed money appears and you have to collect it before it disappears.The main game plays through 40 levels then after that it's just hitting checkpoints every ten levels to try and fully upgrade everything and get a higher score. You can also save where you’re at and quit the game to come back later to keep going. It's a fantastic game with tons of value that can last you a very long time.Bear Rating 10/10"

It is not the best game out there, but it’s by no means the worst.Story:Ultratron is a pretty simple game; you play a little robot that must defeat the many foes and their leaders ahead: Bellum, Lues, Leiunitas, and Letum. The protagonists’ goal in this epic is to get revenge for the fall of earth by the evil forces of robots. As you fight further through the epic campaign you defeat the evil leader robots that destroyed the great planet you knew to love.Campaign:There are forty main levels and with each level the enemies become slightly stronger, although not to the point where it forces you to select specific upgrades. The game isn’t too difficult and you can get through the first 39 levels without too much effort. As you progress through each subsection (10 levels) you must fight one boss and this creates a save, which you can reload and play even after creating the next save ten levels later. You only get one save for each ten levels; this means if you start again you will overwrite your previous character saves.Gameplay:Similar to Revenge of the Titans you cannot buy all the upgrades within the forty levels, before fighting the main boss. Your cash is limited and you must choose which upgrades you want and which ones you don’t. In order to take more hits you must purchase shields, which upon being hit you lose. This means some of your money goes back to buying defense mechanisms to make sure you do not die in one hit.Although, after fighting your way through the main 40 levels the campaign unlocks and allows you to keep playing.One major benefit to this game is that by clicking escape it saves your progress and quits. This means you can be half way between checkpoints and decide you want to take a break without losing a beat.Results:Ultratron is challenging and fun with a lot of variation between rounds because of the upgrade variety. Most of the achievements can be earned by playing the game only a short amount of time. If you ever played geometry wars this is a similar type of game. If you’re fan of arcade games that are in bird’s eye view and are arena shooters then this is the game for you.Hints:->To beat Letum you need to purchase the speed boost upgrade, preferably with Quantum Shift so you can run through his bullets. [I also beat him when playing with near maxed out bullet upgrade which made it a bit easier]->If your find a turret from a spider drop you can pick the turret up and move it by not firing your main gun.->By purchasing the droid level-up upgrade this will allow your droids to level up based on their kill count. This upgrade is only useful if you decide to not fire your blaster and let the droids level up. (I played a play-through using only the lowest level droid and even at level five and fully upgraded it still was weaker than my level two blaster).->You will make your money back if you buy the dot slurper upgrades, as the benefit of the farther reach is incredibly notable.Results:I recommend this game. I personally wouldn't purchase it for $9.99, but if you're a fan of the genre then $9.99 is a good price. If you are not a fan of the genre and can get a coupon or it is on sale for about 75% off then this is a great buy. The game is entertaining and rather simple. It doesn’t require too much time to become good at and is fun to compete with against friends.  The checkpoint system makes it rather entertaining and stops you from having to repeat the whole game over again.Pros:+Different upgrades which you cannot purchase all in one play throughof the main forty levels.+Checkpoint system, so you don’t have to restart at the beginning if you lost by just a hair.+Easy controls with simple gameplay logic+Simple enemies and fun to battle bosses+High replay value+Save and quit option allowing you to stop playing at any point without losing progress.Cons:-Some upgrades seem rather worthless.-The final boss, Letum, is ridiculous in difficulty curve.-There doesn't seem to be any tutorial or hints pages between levels."

It features top-down shooting with a very highly-stylised retro aesthetic. While one can expand on those two points, that's about what there is to it. It's a pretty simple game, and if you're looking for complex gameplay this isn't the place to look for it. What is here, however, is very highly-polished.The game progresses through four coarse stages of a few levels each, culminating with a final boss at the end of each stage. The modes are kept varied by throwing in different stages that are essentially different game modes, for example, a ""Dodge stage"" whereby you must dodge away from a bunch of enemies without shooting them. The level variety does some way make up for the lack of enemy variety, but not quite. There's only a handful of true enemy types, although the actual number could be filled out somewhat since there are successive upgrades of others with minor cosmetic changes that mark their more powerful status.The look of the game itself is what I would describe as pleasantly retro. It has that 8-bit look, but uses a full colour pallete and a variety of modern visual effects to add some jazz to the aesthetic. It comes together quite well, and with a complimentary retro sound design and chiptune-style music, the production oozes 'retro' from every pore. It's brilliant if that's the kind of thing you're looking for, though there are some that may be put off by the simplistic gameplay. If I had one complaint about the visual style its that sometimes the visual effects make it very hard to tell what's going on in the game sometimes. These distortion effects can be disabled in the options though, so it's not a big detriment to the game. If you have trouble with them as I do, you can just turn them off.Unfortunately, for all it's polish it's still a very simplistic game. No doubt if you like the genre you'll get your money's worth out of the game, and I know that's how I felt as I played it. At the same time, however, I feel it won't be sticking with me as much as other games such as Thomas Was Alone did.

It will seem easy at first but will soon become alot harder to dodge bullets and stay alive.Good PointsThe grathical style of the game looks amazing. Its very unique and has its own feel to it. Becasue of this it will grab your attention and keep you playing to see what the next level will look like.There are tons of diffrent upgrades you can buy once you have finished a level such as more health, more powerful guns, pets and grenades. This keeps you playing and keeps the game challenging because you will want to pick the right upgrade.Replayability in Ultratron is its shining point, there is Leaderboads which will keep you playing the longest but there is also lots of Steam achievements and once you completed the game you will start again but harder and keep your score. So there is no reason not to finish playing.The music works well and fits in with the game. Because of this it will draw you in more. The music becomes faster the more you play so you feel pressured to not die. This works well in the game.Controls for Ultratron are simple yet good, they work well and im sure most people will be fine with them. Because they are simple you won't be finding it confusing or hard to play. You can change them in the menu if you feel dont like it.The difficulty is great! It always keeps you on the edge since you wont want to die. Thoughout the game you will have to be 100% focused in the game because if you are not then you will die quickly.The enemie types are very diffrent and unipue thoughout the game. Almost every level will have something diffrent for you to kill. Lots of diffrent bosses make things alot better diffrent.Bad PointsThe length of the game is only about 2 hours but becasue its an arcade game it will be a miner complaint. But its still short and you will complete it since its not to hard fist time round.After a while you will feels a bit bored since there is only 2 modes and that single player and Local Co-op. It gets a bit repetitive after a while.There is not much to show thats diffrent compared to other new arcade games. There is the grathical style but thats about it. Because of this the game feels abit the same, but only a tiny bit.OverallOverall I think That Ultratron is a fun challenge to play if you are bored. Its fun to get high scores and complete but since thats all there is I will rate Ultratron a 7 out of 10. Great fun while it lasts. I would recommend this game to anyone who likes arcade games and highscores."

There's too many things that irritate me, like the mess of pixely blinking & explosions & searchlights & so forth that make it tough to see what's going on (which things are enemies, and which ambient special effects).  It also really suffers from the level carryover problem (see Revenge of the Titans and Puppygames' other offerings), where if you do poorly in one level, you'll be crippled the next.  And if you do poorly in general, you'll be spending all your money on shields, in a downward spiral."

The fickleness of the bonus, its random nature (max shields is far better than a starting drone) and the fact it is only 1-time is both upsetting and badly explained by in the in-game instructions.Shooter pet is a beginners trap even worse, its the first pet you have access too. If its range was doubled it would be balanced with the other two pets but on it's own merits it is never worth buying.Music is great, check out the soundtrack:http://allicorn.bandcamp.com/album/ultratron-ostControl is fluent and perfect and it works with both a PS3 & Xbox controller.Apart from some minor issues the game is as fun as other twin stick shooters and if you enjoy those, you will enjoy this.Join Grumpy reviews for all your gaming needshttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/grumpyreviews"

If you're old enough to remember Robotron 2084 then you'll be right at home here, and if you're familiar with the gameplay of stuff like Geometry Wars, Waves, etc., then you'll enjoy this too.The mechanics are dirt simple, -you move around the arena and you shoot everything. Dead enemies leave ""money"" which can be spent on upgrades and weaponry to boost your performance. Money doesn't come quickly though so it takes a long time to fully upgrade things and you'll never get all the power ups possible.  Boss battles come into play but the main thrust is you are constantly mobbed from all sides and have to dodge your way through fusillades that while tough aren't as bad as ""bullet hell"" games.Layered overtop of this is delicious pixel visuals that are snazzied up with great special effects not seen in the old arcades. Play this in a dark room with some pizza and a soda for the arcade experience.  OOoohhh.Only complaint is the intensity never really escalates to a frenzied level, so it's quite possible to play for a long time and feel like you're either AWESOME!!!! or bored and ready to kamikaze yourself and do something else.

This game can cause serious epilepsy because of the colors that are used in this game. If you have a history of having problems with games with bright colors, I don't recommend this game.)Ultratron is a game that is the remake of the arcade game called ""Robotron 2084"". It's a game that requires good ""eye to hand"" movement as well as aiming and shooting skills. You use the controls to move the robot around while using the mouse to aim where you fire. During combat, you collect coins to help upgrade your robot such as weapons, grenades, and other various weapons. As you progress you also battle in challenges as well as boss fights.My only real complaint is the colors used to make this game.

This condition is known as photosensitive epilepsy.Seizures in photosensitive people may be triggered by exposure to some of the following situations:1: Television screens or computer monitors due to the flicker or rolling images.2: Certain video games or TV broadcasts containing rapid flashes or alternating patterns of different colors.3: Certain visual patterns, especially stripes of contrasting colors.Not all televisions, video games, computer monitors, and strobe lights trigger seizures, however. Even in predisposed individuals, many factors must combine to trigger the photosensitive reaction. Examples include:1: Frequency of the flash (that is, how quickly the light is flashing)2:  Brightness3:  Contrast with background lighting4:  Distance between the viewer and the light source5: Wavelength of the light6: Whether a person’s eyes are open or closedThe frequency or speed of flashing light that is most likely to cause seizures varies from person to person. Generally, flashing lights most likely to trigger seizures are between the frequency of 5 to 30 flashes per second (Hertz).None-the-less, you should get this game. It Rocks!"

I never heard of this game until I saw that the soundtrack was recently released. The story concept and art style was really appealing and I read some good things about this developer, so I decided to pick the game up. I was pleasantly surprised. This game is a really fun throwback to retro arcade games from the 80's. You play as a 'good' robot that must avenge the human race and kill all the 'bad' robots in increasingly difficult levels, with a few boss battles in between. The gameplay is easy to get into, but difficult to master like any good retro-style game. The graphics look great, and successfully blend in some nice modern visuals into its retro style. The powerups are really cool and make you feel powerful. Good play will reward more currency and you can buy upgrades. The user interface is easy to navigate and looks really nice. It's very simple to upgrade your robot, and not confusing at all. The audio fits the game's story very well -- the sound effects and robot voices are perfect and the music is really awesome too. The music ramps up in intensity as you progress through each level, and it really fills you up with a sense of impending doom as you blast wave after wave of evil robots. I bought the soundtrack too. Seriously, thumbs up on the audio design. It really lives up to the art style. This game is all killer, no filler. There is zero fat on this game.

The pacing is comfortable, far less frenetic than (say) Geometry Wars; skilled players looking for that kind of intense death-laden thrillride won't find it here and should look to something like Super Hexagon.  The upgrades and purchasing system layers on some substantial replayabilty, but again if you're good at twin-stick shooters then you'll likely spend an hour on this game before even breaking a sweat, and may not be up for another round.Audio and Visual styles are a major strong point.  This is a vibrant game, executed in glowing neon and spacetime-warp effects, with tons of crap flying around the screen at once... coins to collect, bullets to dodge, robot pets to protect, AI turrets to mind, mines to avoid, powerups to nab.

The reason this is annoying is because you're warned when you're going to face a boss and it makes it sound like a big deal, when in actual fact it's just a larger version of the robots you've came across already, taking up 1/4 of the screen.I bought this thanks to a badge crafting voucher, and i would definitely not pay the retail price for it.

Fast-paced insanity in a small, compact area at its finest.Also, once you get to more difficult levels, try to stay near the middle as much as possible.

76561198075673573,Recommended,219190,22605240,"Posted: 24 April, 2016",all,wrygrass,"I rate the game Ultratron 3.5/5. Pretty good.This is the direct sequel (at least in spirit) to the famous Robotron 2084 arcade game (which I used to play extensively on my Nintendo 64). Ultratron is harder and more complex than Robotron 2084 in every respect but despite its many differences, such as the presence of weapon and character upgrades, better graphics, more complex arenas and the music (Robotron 2084 had no music at all), Ultratron still somehow manages to feel very nostalgic. Despite its high difficulty and despite its initially clunky looking graphics (reminiscent of early 1980s arcade games), this is a seemingly simple but extremely fun game with absolutely no bugs (other than the intentional warping and flipping of the screen).+++++This game is pretty inexpensive.+ The controls are highly responsive and generally outstanding.+ The sound is highly reminiscent of 1980s arcade games. Still, this game's intentionally nostalgic sounds are extremely well done and hearing all the nifty computer sounds this game makes is a lot of fun. Despite how nostalgic the sounds are they will not make your speakers pop. The sounds in this game are high quality. They don't come through as fuzzy, grainy or full of static. Every single sound in this game also tells you something important.+The graphics, while reminiscent of early 1980s arcade games, are actually quite a bit more complex, including some pretty lighting effects and little spotlight rays which follow your character around. The lighting creates a wonderful techno-menacing ambient feeling which goes far to create this game's atmosphere. The overall atmosphere seems to be halfway between a 1980s arcade, a techno rave dance club and a weird, futuristic computer factory. Indeed, the levels all sort of look like they take place in a 2D dance club of some sort which is at once funny and fitting for this game. The high-contrast graphics also helped me concentrate even better than I otherwise would have. The intentionally strange screen distortion effects helped increase the atmospherics of this game still further without significantly distracting from the gameplay. When playing this game it almost looks as if your own computer monitor wants the machines to win but can't really do much about you.+The overall game design and object of the game (destroy everything on the screen) is simple but extremely well executed. Levels are divided into 4 sections, each of which has a boss fight at the end. Once a boss has been defeated you can jump to that section at a later time using the extremely easy-to-use game menu. Between each level you can upgrade your character with little monies you earned while you were destroying enemies during each preceding level (or you can save your little monies for better upgrades later. The boss fights are challenging but only the final one is potentially frustrating (I defeated it on my third try but then I currently hold the 5th highest score in the world). After the final boss, you can continue playing even further to get an even high score. The furthest I've gotten is to level 60 but I think I heard somewhere that there are 100 levels in all but I'm not sure. The designs of all of the smaller enemies are also very, very good, each with their own strengths and weaknesses.+/-+/-+/-+/-+/- Asides from the good main theme and the excellent music which plays during boss fights (the same song which plays on the Steam store's Ultratron page), this game's music is largely mediocre and tends towards an overly complicated and chaotic musical style (that oftentimes would sound more at home in a Unreal Tournament game rather than a little arcade-style game like this). The music can, at times be distracting but the music can be easily turned down.+/-This game gets very difficult very quickly. This is essentially a dual analog game. (I play it with a mouse (to aim and fire with) and keyboard (to move)). If you do not have a background in playing other dual analog games I'd recommend playing some other dual analog games first to get used to the fundamentals of the controls before diving into something as challenging as Ultratron. Playing the original Robotron 2084 (if you can find a good version of it these days) will help you to be better at this game too.----------It would have been nice if the difficulty ramped up more slowly (so the game would have more stages to play through).-This game could use some additional gameplay modes of some sort to add variety and increased replayability. (For example, a mode where you must fire as little as possible, a time trial mode, a boss rush mode etc. would have all been nice additions) As it stands, this is a fairly bare-bones arcade style game with just one mode.-It would be nice to be able to play a cooperative mode with AI's if you don't have any friends who also play this game (like me).-The game needs more variety to its arenas. It needs more traps and physical barriers etc. Maze-like arenas would have been cool too. There's a whole lot more than could be done with this game."

The graphics, sound and overall presentation is as solid as ever, and the twin-stick shooter style of gameplay is engaging and satisfying, and just difficult enough that you won't breeze through it, but won't frustrate either.  It's not something I would spend hours upon hours playing, but you will want to keep coming back to it when you sit down at the computer.  Highly recommended."

,Not Recommended,219190,35074420,Posted: 19 September,all,‡Jaeger Jeximoura‡,"I love Puppygames as a developer. I loved their pixel style and their arcade action that's executed wonderfully with Titan Attacks!, Droid Assault and Revenge of the Titan to name a few.However, I don't feel this way with Ultratron. The style, sound, music and all of the nice traits you'd find in their other games are here. But it might be because there's just too much going on and it would mess with the player's eyes eventually if you play too long.This game is, to me, the weakest entry and at the bottom of the ranks with their games. The visuals are too distracting and it's hard to pay attention between the explosions, the rapid movement of your character and the enemies. The distortion effect that is a common trait with all of these games, happens at random. It doesn't necessarily make the game better when it's just another added nuisance with everything else happening.All of that just turned me off with this entry. Not for the visually challenged, by any stretch."
