Player control can be quickly transferred to any of the units by hitting the assigned numeric key assigned to the drone, or by launching a transfer beam to a nearby friendly unit. You can hack enemy droids into joining your squad, collect upgrades, choose different droid types and go through the floors, fighting bosses and and and.The first few levels are pretty quick but get progressively more challenging…Droid Assault is constructed for players that crave the adrenaline rush of dodging a searing hail of enemy projectiles. Droid Assault is smart, nerve-wracking, and intense. Worthwhile for when you need some minutes of action.I really like the game but the original price (9,99 €) is not adequate in my eyes. I advise to wait for a coupon or a sale."

One of the most brilliant minds in music once said, ""keep it simple stupid"" -J.B. (it’s also origin of K.I.S.S.) and the simplicity of Droid Assault is brilliantly done on so many different levels, from its game play, to graphics, to sound. With this title Puppygames does ""K.I.S.S."" proud.||The gameplay is too damn fun and it's simple, you're a droid (no, not a phone, a robot) who can take control over other enemy droids to make them friendly or you can just blast them away, friendly or not. Once the level is cleared of all enemies, repeat in the next level. You can literally create your own army of droids, that is, if you do not shoot them. There are a lot of different droids all with different attributes, abilities and weapons to make this game even more fun and interesting, along the way picking up a multitude of different power-ups.||The graphics are always very well done with Puppygames games and Droid Assault is no exception, as the contemporized old school graphics are very well designed with that Puppygames genuine style that give this game its beautiful unique flare. ||Though there is no sound track to this game, which to me is the games only downfall, the atmospheric backgrounds and sound effects are immersive and well done, though you may wanna get an appropriate playlist together before you jump into this game. I do sincerely wish that Puppygames did a little more with the sound track like they did with Ultratron.||Controls are a simple WASD and mouse aim combo, or recently added by Puppygames, twin stick controller enabled. Though you do lose some aiming control using a controller. This would be my only other complaint about this game as it implores a lock on system that tends to make shooting distant or faster enemies hard to hit. This also cannot be disabled unless you are using the mouse and keyboard combo.||Also recently added by Puppygames is local co-op which gives this game additional value and replyability. Though there is no online co-op, local co-op sometimes makes fighting go beyond the computer player but with your co-op player for screen space.Gameplay:Top Down Arena Shooter (could also be considered Twin Stick)Graphics:Great Contemporary Old School.Sound:Great sounds effects and atmosphere though missing the music making it overall okay.Controls:Great with mouse and keyboard. Okay with twin sticks (the aiming is more difficult than necessary).Replayability:OMG YES!Overall:9/10 (-1 for disappointing controller aiming and lack of sound track)||It's an awesome and solid game and its old school arcade-ish simplicity has me coming back time and time again. It's a great buy for any collection!"

Admitedly, this is my least favorite Puppygames title so far, which isn't to say it's bad at all, just mainly a bit less of my type. A top down action game where You control a droid with WASD and aim with the mouse - left to shoot, right to hack/transfer. The idea is to destroy all enemy droids while keeping your party alive, which is MUCH easier said than done. The game is a bit less about action skill and more about the managment of your droids, as some are faster than others, or have better defense, or have different weapons more suited for a situation. It's fairly easy for your droids to die, but it's also fairly easy to hack other droids if you have enough transfer points. The AI that commands friendly drones is fairly competent at killing enemies, but not so much at staying alive, so there is a constant need to keep them out of harm's way. Things get real challenging with boss battles and danger areas that throw tons of bots at you - I Think it's expected that you will loose some droids, which will unfortunately loose any upgrades they had. A very clever tactical, action game that use simple mechanics that just work. A challenging game, and I think I got to at least level 30 before I died, but I don't think I can improve much on my skill after my team nearly got wiped out the in the previous couple levels. If the idea of the game appeals to you, definitely get it, just realize there is a big challenge ahead of you in the later level (Ironically, the game seems too easy at the beginning)."

Of course, there are other gameplay elements which may seem interesting at a glance, but believe me, they are not relevant to success in the game.The developers tried to make it look like there is a lot of strategic thinking involved in the game, but I will try to show why that's not the case.You think that having an army of droids is cool? Trying to come up with different combinations, etc... Nope. You can control one droid at a time and the others do whatever they want (read: stupidly die all the time). Having one buffed droid is the only valid ""strategy"".When you transfer to a droid, you don't know what you're going to get. Even when looking at a droid's information screen, the only thing you know for sure is how much health it has. Other pieces of information are either ""ciphered"" (""armour: kevlar"", what does that tell you?) or just ""lore"" (affect nothing). At the same time, you have different ways for droids to interact: maybe some weapons work better against some armours... but we may never know, because there is a huge lack of information. Well, you could spend tons of time and compile a table with information on all the droids, deduce the meanings... but who wants to do that?From what I remember, the bosses are just big droids with big guns, nothing too special.But it's not all that bad. The game looks cool, I guess. Upgrading the droids can feel nice...Droid Assault can be fun for a few hours, maybe for one playthrough, but it is not worth the full price.★★★★★☆☆☆☆☆"

Bit less about arcade twitch reflexes and more about tactics and squad management than the other Puppy games, just a bit. You roam around with your bot, destroying other bots or taking them over with your transfer beam. Cleaning the building floor by floor. Unlike in Paradroid, you get to keep the old bodies as allies and transfer control at will to them as well. You could still play this game much like Paradroid keeping the control on and getting all the powerups for your best chassis and using the others as cannon fodder.What I miss about Paradroid is minigame for taking over the bots. Bit more elaborate than the concept of ""transfer points"" used here. Maybe they felt, it'd break the flow or something. Still a good game, though."

This is a nifty little arcade style point and click shooter slightly reminiscent of an astroids style game. Things like, energy capacity that regulates your ability to fire, fully auto fire, and different types of guns will be your main differences in control structure.It's a fun game, but should probably only be played 5-10 levels at a time. Since you can continue from the main menu after every 5 levels or so. Battle through 50 levels or so, and then the checkpoint system disappears, marking the end of the main game. However this is one of those games that is not defined by the end game, but rather the experience. You can run through the same levels again using different bots to keep things fresh.The sounds of this game can grate on you after a prolonged period of time. Remember that asteroids reference, if you liked listening to those sounds then you will love this. If you're like me then after an hour or two those little beeps, blips, bleeps, and chimes will really annoy you. Not enough to distract from the experience of blowing up bots, but still annoying.I got this through a coupon from a badge I crafted for like $0.30.

The graphics are bad, but this is too difficult to be a BAD game!""That is not what Droid Assault is.First off, I *like* graphic simplicity, but this feels ""slick"", as if the developers cared to make a game that doesn't look cheap.  Secondly, it IS difficult.  You'll win a bunch of levels, but if you start from the beginning every time, you'll find yourself stuck; getting past the upper levels requires starting the game at the later levels - which itself is difficult.Gameplay: you have different bot models, and you have a limited resource with which you can take over new ones.  It's almost impossible to use pickups to buff up one 'droid to INVINCIBLE POWAH.  Healing is minimal (but it does exist), which means you have to strategize which 'bots to play, and which bots to leave to an AI death.The more you play, the more you'll find that the strategy is all-important - and THAT is what I most often like about retro gaming.  This game has replayability, but not because you've built up an unstoppable 'bot; that's impossible.  Instead, Droid Assault rewards smart game play.  Honestly, for the price I'd say you can NOT lose, and you may just find yourself sucked into a game the way you used to when you were younger.I hope this review is useful..."

I think it's because they're mostly just little arcade games, rather than anything more ambitious, but they generally have a really good art style. Droid Assault's gameplay mechanics aren't always the best-thought-out (droids you aren't controlling are fatally stupid, generally making it difficult to recover from losing or taking disastrous amounts of damage to your best droid), but it still made for a fun game up through completing the story mode.I wasn't personally tempted to play more than that (which only took me 2 hours), even though it's got a lot of room for replayability, so the $10 price tag might be steep. If it's discounted, though, I'd say this one is worth picking up."

Back then the graphics were drawn lines and small human-like block droids that sounded like the Daleks from Dr. Who.  While the graphics in this game 'Droid Assault' aren't exactly the latest frostbyte engine of today... I don't believe they're meant to be either.The developer 'puppygames' has a number of games that have this same nostalogic feel.  Graphics are a big part of that.  They've done a good job of giving you that nostolgic  feel but also giving you a new game entirely.  This game may remind me of that old 'Berzerk' game but it plays like a modern arcade game.You play the part of a droid that has to neutralize other droids within a given facility (map) while they also try to neutralize you.  You can neutralize them by destroying them or hacking them.  There are different levels of destructive power and hacking capabilities of each droid depending on the droid.  After you hack a droid...  it's yours and you can then use that droid.  You can amass a team of different droids and switch between them.  If one is destroyed, you can still control one of your other droids.  After all your droids are destroyed then it's game over.  The levels move along by defeating each progressively challenging level and then getting a boss level.Movement was rather easy using WSAD for movement and using your mouse for aiming and firing with a kind of overhead view.  There's a number of games that use this method of movement and action for game play, so it's something you should prolly get used to if you haven't by now.  WSAD and left mouse button for firing... right button for hacking droids.  You have different levels of destruction and security for each droid and each droid is good for something that another isn't.  The idea is that you're able to utilize them as a team to do more havoc. The game gets progressively better as you learn to recognize the different droids and what their capabilities are.It's a fun game.  I recommend for those 'arcade style'  junkies like myself.

This allows you to build an army or get to play better droids. If you lose all your droids, it's game over.The first few levels feel easy, but it's getting harder pretty quickly.

You can either destroy the enemy, or capture them to become part of your squad. There are many types of droids with different weapons, armour strength and movement speeds. These stats can also be improved by collecting powerups dropped by fallen enemies. More powerful droids are more expensive to capture, so in theory there is deep strategy when deciding which droids to capture. However, this is mostly negated by the stupid friendly AI. The player only controls one droid at a time, and the rest of your squad will just do their own thing. Maybe theyll follow you, maybe theyll wander off in a random direction. Whatever happens, they will die VERY quickly. I found the best strategy to just have one droid, and then only capture a new droid when I was close to death.

While that's a good thing, that doesn't necessarily make the gameplay awesome as well.I enjoyed Revenge Of The Titans. It looked simple, but the gameplay was more complex than you might have initially thought. Droid Assault uses this same principle, but it is more shallow. It mixes action with some light strategy elements.The goal is to capture (more and bigger) droids and use them to kill the remaining droids. Once you've killed them all it's on to the next level until, after 10 levels, you face a boss. Then the whole thing continues, in some sort of a cycle, and the game becomes harder and harder.Killing droids will reward you with power-ups that might help you on your quest to become a bad♥♥♥♥♥droid. All upgrades are permanent, but if you lose a droid it's gone forever. So you have to carefully maneuver around.I had fun for about an hour, then I quickly lost interest.

Each bot you can control has a generally unique description and use, some are good at tanking, others good at firing missles from a distance. This game encourages exploration and essentially is a score attacker's wet dream.Breaking down the mechanics, you can control up to 8 different units at a time, although doing so is risky. Once you release control of a certain droid, you've handed it over to the AI which isn't entirely tantamount to suicide for the bot, but damn near close. Either way, you'll be doing most of the work unless you simply don't want to. There's a variety of playstyles that Droid Assault caters to, from the sniper to the tank, and better yet.There's upgrades. Not all upgrades apply to all bots, but the vast majority do. Speed, defense, attack damage, armor. Powerups litter the field and the game pushes you do pop open every single crate for that either special overleveled bot, or a weaker variant that might just drop that piece of salvation you've been looking for. Crates themselves serve as holding containers for random bots geared towards the level you're playing on. So you won't be getting a massive boss-esque bot out of one in your first level or two.Moving onto Bosses, there are a slew of them in the game that all follow the same archetype. Two to four guns on each side which are destroyable for further powerups, and a primary weapon. Tactics mean everything or nothing depending on how well you've progressed. There's a defenite rougelite element to the game and it's worth replaying over and over if only to get that final ending.Basically, buy it. It's good, fun, and a new update just included local co-op which supports the gamepad wonderfully.

There is a config file that can be used to alter the default mappings, but the IDs used in that config file do not correspond to anything sensible. Getting it to work properly is unlikely, if not impossible, even with the extremely popular Logitech gamepads that work fine in Steam Big Picture and in other games.

He then bans them from the game forum. Reading the trail of message threads that showed this happening to several other users left me afraid to post any criticism at all.I suspect the controller problems are rooted in the fact that this game is written in Java, and probably uses a broken game controller library.

Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes.

The art style that they are probably most known for is completely at its peak here. It draws inspiration from many different titles, unlike some of their other games that only draw from a few, and plays a bit like Smash TV. Basically, the game breaks down to you being a virus and contaminating robots to kills other robots and continue to contaminate more robots. This game gets very difficult very quick, and the boss battles are fun and challenging. There is also an almost roguelike element to this game in the robots you acquire. There are multiple combinations of armor types, weapons, sensors and the such that work in many different combinations that makes each one slightly unique. Because of this you sometimes find yourself thinking whether this robot or that one would be best, or if you should save your transfers and continue hunting. Every playthrough is a little different, and there is a certain level of strategy involved, which keeps it fresh every time you play. Lots of fun, I would recommend it to anyone, especially with the low end price tag its offered at."

The droid designs are surprisingly diverse considering how simple the models are.  There is also a deeper level of strategy than one might expect.  You need to balance the number of droids in your squad against the strength of each of them, since you only get so many ""transfer points.""  More powerful droids take more points, so it's hard to fill up on really strong ones.  You also room for a range of playstyles; you can play it like a bullet hell with a really fast droid and evade shots left and right, you can stay back with a long-range weapon and try not to die, you can switch between a few really strong droids and balance upgrades between them, you can power up a single droid and have a bunch of low-level minions swarming around, et cetera.This game surprised me in a very good way.

So i tried a different strategy: not creating an army at all, and instead focus on transfering to a single robot with more survivability, and then collect as many powerups as possible to increase said survivability.And what i found was that the game doesn't drop enough powerups in order to make this possible. So i gave up.Now there seems to be people who have beaten this game, so something must work. and it may just be i who suck. But in the end i still cannot recommend Droid Assault, because it's too dependent on its AI, creating artificial difficulty as a result. Something simply ain't right when one has to avoid using the main mechanic of the game.EDIT: I did manage to beat it, but only by exploiting the ""sharp bullet"" power-up that allows you to shoot through walls. I picked a robot with high survivability and upgraded it fully. and then i just hid in ventilation shafts etc. and shot blindly towards that which the radar pointed me to. (the radar points you to the closest enemy)I have a feeling that the developers didn't intend me to beat the game that way"
