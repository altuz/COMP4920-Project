It has a clear vision: A pleasant atmosphere with just enough mystery to keep you playing until the end. However, I was left really wanting more opportunities to interact with my wonderful surroundings more than I actually could. And so, the world was never as immersive as you'd hope.I'd be interested in a sequel that takes this idea farther. There is definitely something to it."
,Recommended,219680,32701185,Posted: 23 June,all,Venceremos,"As one of the most famous non-games in recent years, in a discussion concerning the definition of ""game"" it's rather difficult not to mention Proteus.The whole idea as I gather is the absence of gameplay elements. In very limited meaningful feedbacks generated by player actions and its lack of story, goal and development the game somehow manage to create a huge sense of progression in certain points of your first play through.Audio cues are graceful and impressive with each falling petal, rain drop and snow flake strikes a note, making the experience a symphony of the natural surroundings.A soothing and serene experience. Like that one time on your way home you stopped just to admire some buttercups for a minute or two. Without taking pictures."

It's hard to call Proteus a game, and it's also hard to call a game ""art"".Typically, games consist of objectives, things to accomplish. Proteus does not.

The warm, shifting colors fit perfectly to the soothing music, which alters depending on which element you pass. The sun rises, the sun sets, seasons go by until a year has passed. And you wander around, unwinding and enjoying the scenery and finding little eastereggs everywhere. Day and night have their own secrets, as do the seasons.Still the game does seem to be a bit short lived. The island is just not that big and after a couple of playthroughs (which mostly take around 40 minutes or so, depending on how long you choose to linger) you've seen all there is to see in this world. It would be wonderful to see this changed in either an update or a sequel. Bigger islands, more elements. That's basically it as far as I'm concerned.In the end I enjoyed Proteus, although maybe not for its full €10,- price (at the time of writing this review). It left me with a taste for more; I might even acquire Journey, The Unfinished Swan  or replay PS3's Flower just because of this."

I think it crashed and still had a process running in the background or something. I probably played for 90 minutes before feeling done.This is a fine abstract walking simulator. The color aesthetic and sounds are great, but after getting that initial feeling, there's not really that much else to do or be surprised by. Aside from a couple of ""wow"" moments as you progress, it mostly felt like a randomly-generated island. Worth trying, but I can't really say I ""recommend"" it."

,Recommended,219680,8599154,"Posted: 6 January, 2014",all,noibn,"Proteus is not a traditional game. In fact, it's not really a game at all. I guess I would call it a sort of... ""interactive experience""... (?) ... I dunno... (how's that for generic?). But seriously, this is a tough one to describe. Each time you play, the game - err, EXPERIENCE - puts you on a randomly built island. The island is full of trees, wildlife, mysterious stones, and more. Your goal, if you want to think of it as such, is simply to walk around and explore. That's it. Technically, you can ""finish"" each session by performing a series of specific actions (which I won't spoil), but essentially, you just walk around and explore the island through 4 seasons, starting in Spring. As you explore, the things you do and see affect the soundtrack, which is primarily comprised of low-key ambient sounds. The visuals are also very simplistic. The various trees, flora, terrain and animals you encounter are all rendered using the most basic blocky sprites imaginable. A good way to think of it is if the Atari 2600 had the capability to render a fully 3D world - this is exactly what that would look like. You wouldn't think such simple graphics could adequately portray a setting like this, but it actually works. Just watching how the environment changes from day to night and through seasons, it just looks so cool. Although the visuals and music are extremely simple, when taken together, the combination makes for an extremely relaxing and enjoyable experience.Before I close, I must reiterate one final time that this is not a game. I repeat - THIS IS NOT A GAME. This is one of those fancy pretentious artsy game-type things. If you are not into artsy game experiences, then stay clear. This is not the game for you. However, if you can handle non-traditional experimental games and this seems even remotely interesting, I fully recommend picking it up (definitely if it's on sale, but for full price, I'm not so sure... that's your call). In terms of length, you can see just about everything there is to see in maybe an hour or so. But that's not a negative. Nor is it the whole story. I see this is a game that you can come back to again and again for a slightly different experience, any time you just want to chill out and relax. So it does potentially have replayability, especially with the randomization aspects of the island. All in all, I really enjoyed my time with this and think it's definitely worthy of a look from those with an open mind and spare cash to burn. Check it out."

Who wants to pay money to view purely a visual-driven game? There's no goal, no enemies, and usually an abstract story that can't really be fully understood so the viewer has to come up with their own meaning.How this game seperates itself is... Well actually. It really doesn't. I guarantee that if you look at a Let's Play or enough comments you'll start loosing value in the game instantly. Something is lost by YOU not experiencing it. Looking in a direction, deciding to follow some weird trial, investigating weird things by yourself. It all helps you feel invested in the game. Basically, this is a good visual game. If you like games the help you relax and feel good, this won't let you down. On the other hand, if you're expecting something more. Keep movin'."

I don't mind a good walking simulator--I thoroughly enjoyedKairo, but unlike that game, there is not even a hint of a story here, nor are there puzzles to solve. I think I see what the developers were trying to do here and I would consider this as ""video games as art"", but there just isn't enough content to justify me spending time with it. I thought maybe I was missing something, but after reading a few Steam guides, it appears that I have pretty much seen everything that this game has to offer in just over an hour. I think if I had spent $9.99 on this, I would be pretty cheesed off. I am glad I got this on sale and only spent a third of that on this game, but I still feel like I overpaid.UPDATED: I just wanted to say that the only reason why my game time is up over 2 hours now is because my 7-year-old was interested in the game for a little while and wanted to try it out. Even he lost interest with it after not too long. Notice that many of the Steam users who gave this game a good review have less than an hour of gameplay. There just isn't really much content here."

The graphics look very low-fi in the stills, but when the game is in action, the illusion is so complete, it all works. While people who don't give Proteus a chance and play it through at least once say otherwise, the game DOES have a beginning and end, and completing it once unlocks a few extra options (including allowing the terrain generator to get a bit crazier).The save system is very clever. If you want to save a particular random seed because you like the island you're on, hit F9 to save a postcard. This postcard is a screenshot of basically your perspective at that moment, but it's more than that. The game visually encodes data into the image, and the image acts as a save state: Not only will you return to that island, you'll return to that moment.If you can handle going 30 minutes in a game without blowing something up or killing a terrorist, you should take a long moment to consider Proteus."

I'm writing this review about 2 weeks after I beat it, so don't expect a huge complex review because i'm for sure not playing it again.It's one of those games where you play it to completion and then never touch it again, similar to Journey. If you're into a rich experience with a few things to discover along the way, this is the game for you. There isn't too much gameplay and the island is very small and hard to explore because you walk so slow, but the progression of the story runs on secrets so once you faff about enough you can eventually find the place to go to the next area. I'm not going to spoil anything but the game certainly isn't as pretentious as the trailer looks, it's just a simply relaxing experience with no hidden ""message"" along the way. that in itself may seem like an odd thing to say in a review, but it's one of the main things that almost stopped me from buying the game. I didn't quite like the ending, and although it was powerful it lasted way too long. The main part- the music, wasn't too special. It was relaxing but after a while it all started to sound too samey. It's possible that was the point though, as the whole island seems dreamlike at points and really chills you out.Overall, while this game is extremely relaxing with a great atmosphere, it probably isn't for everyone. While I did find a few secrets along the way I do not believe there is any replay value or incentive to even start up the game again after completing it. You also walk almost as slow as ""Dear Esther"" so don't expect to be cruising around the island looking at things. The whole game takes time. I bought Journey for 15 dollars, beat it in an hour and didn't regret it at all due to the artistic quality and depth of the game. I bought this game for 10 and beat it in an hour as well, and feel the same way. Buying this game is like buying a ticket to an art gallery, just sit back and look at the paintings.

I found myself rather bored as I walked at a slow pace around the island searching for interesting landmarks (of which there are few). I feel like this game comes close to being good but just doesn’t quite get there.I will complement Proteus for definitely giving a sense of atmosphere. The aesthetics are very well executed and the audio and visuals work very well together to give it a sense of charm.For those of you who subscribe to the idea of having a certain amount of time per dollar invested (I personally don’t) then I am afraid Proteus will disappoint. My first playthrough lasted roughly 40 minutes and while the island is randomly generated each time you are still going to be stumbling upon the same few landmarks each time and you probably won’t find much in the way of anything new on your second playthrough.If it had some sort of story or more environments and cool landmarks or even just some level of interactivity then I could see this game as being something special, but at the state the developer left it in, it is simply charmingly boring."

The first time I played the game, my emotions ranged from frustration to boredom.I didn't give this a negative review, and I'll tell you why, but let me get to the negative points you should absolutely know before you buy this:CONS:-The Pricetag: Not worth full price. Wait 'til it's at least half off, if not more. Seriously, people have put out better content (game-wise) for free.-Fiddle with the mouse a bit-- I found the sensitivity was way too low for my liking.-The keys to capture a postcard of the island and load an island don't work for me (probably something to do with my f9 through f11 keys having dual purpose). There is no option to change those keys.-You have to be in the mood to ""experience"" the game. If you're not relaxed, it's not worth it. Treat it like meditation rather than gaming.PROS:My second Proteus experience: I opened up the game today, fiddled with the mouse sensitivity, and dived right in. Today, my friends-- today, I was chill as ♥♥♥♥. I turned off the lights, put on some headphones, and just immersed myself in it. And it was like videogame Buddha walked right the ♥♥♥♥ over and whispered in my ear: ""Yo. Yo, Carol-- this game right here is mother♥♥♥♥ing videogame nirvana."" And it was glorious.TL;DR --If you like to meditate, but you have trouble doing it the old-fashioned way 'cuz you have, like, ADD or something (like me), or you end up falling asleep instead, THIS IS FOR YOU.

,Recommended,219680,243263,"Posted: 15 February, 2013",all,Lord Weh,"I'm not sure this counts as a game, but it definitely is a piece of art.The screenshots capture the mood of the game very well, you begin near an island which you head towards, then move across the island listening to dynamic 'music' as you approach trees, flowers, towers, stone circles and mountains. Each of these elements change slowly over time. Once night falls, you find a stone circle that will advance time to the next season. Once you have experienced Spring, Summer, Autumn and Winter you will rise above the island and your experience will be over.The islands are randomly generated, so each experience is slightly different.Whilst I don't think this counts as a game, it is a beautiful and striking piece of art. It is slow and peaceful, something that takes time and patience, but there is something to appreciate here. Climbing a mountain above the morning mist in summer and watching the clouds roll below you is really quite moving, the stars spin away slowly at night and you can see comets streaking the sky on occassion. Small clusters of chickens run from you, conjuring up another layer of the dynamic music. Part of the charm of the game is moving near these small elements and seeing how they react, what they do, if anything at all. Sometimes just sitting and watching these elements reveals small surprises.The graphics are simplistic, but there is a strength in their simplicity. The style brings to mind old text adventure game screens brought to life. The colour pallette is really striking and part of the strength of the games beauty. The sun sets and you see the sky and the clouds and the trees change from greens to browns to oranges, into the cool blues of night.A walk through a virtual environment that may not be for everyone, but for those patient and willing to try, it is an experience unlike anything else."

Proteus consists of a short stroll through a randomly-generated island that, on first impression, seems to have no purpose or any form of progression. In reality, it's a relaxing little treasure hunt in a (rather well rendered) pixelly world. Unlike Flower and Journey, Proteus lacks progression (with the exception of the changing seasons) and a story. There are a few interesting landmarks and creatures on the island, and that's really about it. The environment-generated music was a little on the gimmicky side at first, but it grew on me. The few interactive sites that sometimes appear are neat, though a bit arbitrary. The ""snapshot"" mechanic is actually quite interesting. Pressing F9 in game saves a special screenshot of the game that can be used to access the same island again (a new island is generated each time you start the game) so that you can return and explore some more. A minor gripe is that, while the snapshots can be used by anyone who owns Proteus to explore the same island, Steam does not recognize them as screenshots so they need to be shared differently. You need to find the Snapshots folder in your game directory to be able to add or share snapshots. Proteus has moderate replayability due to the randomly generated nature of the island, but frankly that's not enough to keep players coming back for dozens of hours of gameplay. Also, some of the ""things"" (for lack of a better word) in this game may seem confusing and pointless without going through guides, but I believe that it was more fun to explore without spoiling anything, frustration notwithstanding.Overall, Proteus is relaxing and fun to explore in, but if you are looking for any amount or direction or story, you are going to hate this game and want your money back.On the subject of price, I bought Proteus for $2 during a sale, and frankly, that's around the maximum amount of money I'd spend on this game. The normal price ($10) is a bit excessive for what feels like a glorified engine demo.Pros:-Decent art style-Snapshot mechanic-Relaxing-Surprising amount of exploration capacityCons:-No story-Steep price for a couple hours of simplistic gameplay-Niche audience6/10"

This is a game for someone who wants to be transported to a place for wondering and wandering.Yeah I realize this is the sort of thing that makes everyone wax pretentious or plebeian depending on their inclination, but for good reason. People go into Proteus expecting an adventure game or puzzle game and they get a walking simulator without even an interact button. Or, on the other side of the token, they come into it with basic understanding of the game and an appreciation for nature scenes and they are dazzled by the ambience and purity of the experience (this is what happened to me).So I'll try to give it to you straight. Proteus is a software toy that creates an island with random terrain and landmark placement which you can then wander around. Yes, it is an island, not infinite. Various things happen in the environment of their own agency or through your getting close to them. The island undergoes certain changes if you go to the right place at the right time, at which point you can wander the island again--same terrain, but different due to the aforementioned changes. The game does not last forever; there is an ending. The ambient music is abstract, changing depending on your environment and what things you are interacting with; the sound effects are music and the music is sound effects. The graphics are mostly 2D sprites on 3D terrain. There is no real goal.The interactive music and surroundings which you can easily familiarize yourself with give the game a very strong sense of place. I would call it a pixelated, interactive painting that sings to you. I like Proteus because it provides a reprieve from whatever I'm doing: the strong immersion and lack of goals turns it into a place for relaxation more than anything else. I go to Proteus whenever it's gross outside or I'm stressed and it's too late to go out.So that's Proteus.  I am only picking ""yes"" because I personally like the game. Get it if you want an environment to watch and explore, but not necessarily shape; get it if you want an aesthetic experience with little traditional gameplay. Do not get it if you want anything more."

Turns out, it was an enriching, artistic experience after playing it for an even further 15 minutes!!! (next level play time right there!)

Quite the change since I last reviewed and tried this game, I enjoyed following the animals, wandering around, teleporting through time and space to reach a certain time in the day-night cycle. Quite the adventure indeed.i r8 8/8 is good to play with a m8.As afore-metnioned by previous reviewees, this game isn't for everyone and in my perspective after playing about 12 minutes of the game, and watching a couple minutes worth of youtube gameplay, I found it somewhat disinteresting. Even with it's beautiful soundtrack (to which I purchased and enjoyed) and immersive setting within it's explortion thema, I found that the lack of interaction made me lose intrest, not that I dislike it but I found it quite interesting to explore towers, walking through pathways and exploring the island. However, I felt it needed more than just an exploring immersive experience, but more user interaction such as possibly, more exploration features and picking items maybe? Or maybe the goal of the game didn't reach out to the audience as well percieved. Also maybe because I only played the game a while back with a crappy computer, it caused some slight dizziness where the DOF (depth of field) was set at for for FP (first-person) mode.But overall, I would rate this game about 6/10.

,Recommended,219680,13466583,"Posted: 19 December, 2014",all,Mata,"Video games teach us to follow linear pathways to achieve a clear objective and reach a single, desirable end, a clear ""game over"" where we know we've succeeded or failed. Proteus could not deviate from that system farther. The first time I opened the game (which was just now), I found myself tearing up over... well, it's beauty, it's adventure, it's hard to describe. It's Proteus. (now admittedly I'm a huge wimp, but the experience was really emotionally moving, and not at all something I expected from a video game :P) It felt like five minutes of gametime; my Steam says I've logged five times that much. If any game is truly magical, it's Proteus.Most games are easily beatable with a lot of grinding and the help of a google search, a wiki, or a friend, but the thing about Proteus is you don't ""beat"" it. You just play it. That's somewhat of a radical thing in video games, I think, and it makes playing Proteus a real stress-relieving experience. There's nothing to tell you what's going to happen, or even how you go about making it happen - that's what playing the game is for! You explore, you learn, you discover. It's a game that doesn't bend itself to the will of a dedicated, competitive player, it's a game that takes you along for an adventure. The music has the quality of pre-composed pieces but is formed naturally as you explore the environment, which changes with what seems to be a mind of its own. Swim to that island. Bump into that rock. Follow that blue hopping thing. Who knows where you'll end up? I don't. My mom don't. The wiki don't. At least I sure hope it don't... This game is whatever you want it to be, so I encourage any players not to start with asking what they can find or how to find it, but just to hop into the game and enter their own little dreamscape where anything and everything can happen. :3On the practical side the game is very friendly with the options. You can play it fullscreen or in a window and you can adjust your field-of-view and mouse sensitivity very easily and even do it ingame if you please. The creators have pulled out all the stops to make sure this game is a convenient and comfortable experience as well as a beautiful one. I reckon I'd pay the full ten bucks for it, but if you can, get it on sale; whenever you can get your hands on it, Proteus will be waiting for you. :PThe game's not for everyone, but if you enjoy video games as an art form, if you're looking for a truly unique adventure that's both dynamic and peaceful at the same time, and heck, if you just flippin want to, give Proteus a try. This is a world I wouldn't mind going to when I die."

It's the story of an Emperor who starts walking around outside in the nude and everyone around him has nothing but praise for his ""new clothes"". Basically each bystander knows that he's actually naked but they're too afraid of going against the crowd by acknowledging it publicly. That story is just like this game. All the reviewers I've seen say that it's ""intoxicating"" They say it's so good that it'll just suck the hours away with its immersive genius. I say this ""game"" is in fact a cynical practical joke made by the developer at the gaming community's expense with the explicit purpose of proving that people will buy *anything*. There is no interactivity whatsoever. The game consists of pixels of alternating colors (sometimes they move and sometimes they don't) accompanied by stereotypically surreal ambient music. I do get (and even appreciate) that sometimes developers push the boundaries of what a game actually is (Osmos, etc.) but under no circumstances... on no planet... could this title honestly be referred to as a ""game"". My experience consisted of walking around aimlessly for about 10 minutes until I realized that you can't do anything. Literally. A youtube video is more interactive than this (since you can at least pause it). I bought this game based on having read several reviews but now I seriously regret it. I want my $10 back. Selling this title on Steam without appropriate warnings, prominently placed, is tantamount to theft.Update (01/13/14) -Below is a snippet from a user review on metacritic that says it way better than I did:""Proteus isn't actually a video game, it isn't even an interactive movie. I'd hardly even call it an ""experience"" let alone the digital Nirvana people claim it is. Proteus takes the ""player"" to an island which is supposedly randomly generated and it features a lot of pixelated objects passing for natural objects and animals. The player walks around using the WASD keys (W, mostly) and looks around with the mouse the music changes according to where you are walking and what you are looking at. Although the music will speak to New-Age electronic fans the game play won't. Neither will the graphics. Animals scurrying away and solid objects blocking your path is about the extent of your interaction with the world. There is supposedly an end to the game and I believe that ""progress"" is made by chasing certain objects in the world. This game is simply put an over-priced art-house project that one would expect to find on as a sort of attachment to a game developer's résumé. The odd thing is the high praise the game receives."""

When you view the screenshots, it may not look like much with its extremely dated pixelated graphics, but the developers sure knew how to use that visual style in interesting ways. The music is generated by the changing landscape as you explore and those willing to appreciate this ""game"" as artistic expression will probably enjoy that immensely. The colors are great, the sprite effects visually interesting. Proteus is a wonderful world to explore for about 20 minutes. Then you realize there's no point to it and the experience is over. It's like stopping to look at a painting in a museum, taking it in, and moving on. There is no ""game"" here in any traditional sense. It's just exploration and soothing music. What you see in the trailer is the highlights of what you'll see in-game. If Proteus were $1 or 2, I would probably recommend it. At $10, I cannot. Just check out a ""Let's Play"" on YouTube.

Proteus has a certain atmosphere most games aren't able to master. Its using the persons mind to imagine what the world ""feels"" like. Unlike most Triple A games where HD graphics are the norm, Proteus takes gaming back to when you had to IMAGINE what was happening on screen and believe you were in it. Its a certain charm most games lose due to the game screaming at you to go to the next checkpoint, or mission when they really could focus on the environment and setting. Thats why I play FPS's like CoD and heavily critize the campaign for its lack there of immersion. All around this game is not a game, its a statement about modern gaming.

They can be exciting, gripping, and engaging, certainly. They can demand your full attention, and hold you, breathless with anticipation, spellbound by the compulsion to uncover more of their world, to play the next match, the next level, the next moment. They are magical, in the way they can draw the player in and keep them engaged despite the challenges they may present and the stress they can occasionally cause.But games can also draw stress out of us, too. They can soothe, they can relax, and they can even heal. Certainly, they can provide a distraction, and often... that's enough.And Proteus makes a wonderful distraction in that regard. It isn't much in the way of mechanics -- you generate a new world and wake up there, free to wander around and explore it. That's all there really is to it -- seeing what comes next, seeing what the world has to offer as it changes and evolves over the days and the seasons is its own reward, and some people may find that off-putting. Certainly, those people are entitled to their preferences, as well.But others may find in Proteus the exact break they need from whatever they've been playing recently, a quiet escape away from everything else nagging them in worlds both real and fictional. There is beauty in simplicity, and sparse mechanics executed well can be better than feature-rich experiences with less polish, to the right person. I happened to really enjoy this game personally (and do pardon my playtime, I tend to be an offline player in most things.)As to whether or not you might enjoy this -- if you want to interact and get into the nitty-gritty of things, you may wind up diappointed here. Walking around and sightseeing is the brunt of what you will find in Proteus' gameplay offerings. Those who already enjoy walking simulators will feel right at home so long as the art style appeals to you! For anyone left undecided, all I can advise is that if you think you will enjoy it, with the knowledge of how the game operates fresh in memory -- if you need a break from your traditional fare or you feel drawn to this game -- give it a chance, grab it on sale if you can, and see how you feel about things.I hope you find what you're looking for in it.

With some interesting visuals and a focus on playing around, the game is for people who want something experimental and playful and/or want to back an innovative game.  Not for something where you're looking for scores, skilltrees, and so on.Proteus is wandering through a child's drawing while listening to a freeform prog rock soundtrack.  If that appeals to you, then it's probably a game to get.  Be warned - it's not for everyone.Every time you start Proteus, you end up in the ocean near a procedurally generated island.  As you explore, the sound reflects the surroundings.  You wander into the soundtrack, as it were.Exploring the island allows you to experience various sites, find interesting things, or just hang out.  There's various landmarks in each game that provide certain features, as well as plenty of randomness.  There's some discoveries to be made that will let you experience the game in depth, and there is an ""end"" to get to if you want (and lets you experience assorted visual and auditory experiences).Then?  You can start again.It's really a game of wandering, playing on that urge that often drives us to see ""just what's around here"", combined with the freeform soundtrack.  It's compelling and relaxing, like you're experiencing a dream.If you want a game with skilltrees, combat, construction, etc. it isn't for you.  You don't do anything except choose where you go and what you experience.  I find myself playing it when I need to take a short break, and it's surprisingly soothing.Is it for you?  Like many games it depends on you - if the description has you interested, it probably is."

I bought it because i like walking simulators, but it's less of a walking simulator and more of an interactive ambient playground. Although it's procedurally-generated, it never feels like you are wandering round in a giant random number generator - the encounters with wildlife and the semi-scripted events help you feel like you are part of a traditional narrative. The graphics are extremely minimal, but the color palette is spectacular. I haven't spent so long watching a video game sunset since Cryo Interactive's Dune. But the music is the real winner. This is ambient music at its finest, and anyone who has even a passing interest in techno or electronic music should run out and get this game right now - it's like walking around in a Future Sound of London video clip.

Just some loose, short and rather ambiguous opinions of the overall product as a whole, hardly anything constructive or informative, something that is unfortunately quite common in the review section, but it is definitely no excuse for producing a rather poor piece of writing regarding this particular product (even if I'm not a journalist, I should have tried harder). The problem is, that this type of game doesn't really suit me and does not match my preferences, something I didn't know before I tried it, and since I was unable to gain enjoyment out of this, I felt somewhat salty and decided to leave unfavorable opinion.I can definitely say that the graphics are really nice,and although they are simplistic, I think they are the perfect choice for this kind of game, because of their charm and the fact that they go extremely well with the soundtrack, that is dynamic and changes depending on what happens on the screen. But unfortunately this is how I perceive this game: simple (though pleasant) graphics accompanied by the appropriate, everchnaging soundtrack, and the only one can do is to explore the procedurally generated island, something that I, personally, wasn't captivated by and ultimately didn't enjoy. In the end, if I were to summarize my whole experience I would say that ""It isn't my cup of tea.""If you are considering the purchase of this game, I hope my thoughts can be of some use, maybe as another point of view, though I highly encourage you to read other reviews, as others explored the features of this game more extensively. And if you enjoyed this game, I must say that I am envious that it met your expectations, though I'm glad it did, as at the end of the day this is the most important part of all the gaming: to have fun.ORIGINAL REVIEW:While the idea is interesting, and the soundtrack is quite relaxing, ""Proteus"" gets boring really quick. The only thing player can do, is to walk around and observe the rather empty scenery. Seven euros is way too much for this game. To be honest, it doesn't deserve even half of the asked price."

Some seem to die during different seasons but that speculation on my part. You take from the game what you personally experience.  Scary actually at certain points and nothing changed really but the lighting.I think it shows you the joy of life, how it changes, how to appreciate seasons, and a hint possibly that death is more than just death.  Took me 40 minutes to get through to what I can only guess was the end. Nothing dramatic, no epic end story. You just know its the end when you see it. Certainly will go through this again to see if the experiences are different per play through but first time through was pretty joyful. You smile a lot, frown a lot, seem even sad at times. There is no playing this game, there is only experiencing whatever message you take from it. I can only say my experience said this.

Although void of clear objectives, player abilities, or direction, the game feeds off of the curiosity of the player. As you explore the procedurally generated island you are placed on when the game loads, scampering creatures, beautiful fauna, and a rich tapestry of colors and sights all generate music as you come into contact with them. Each time you play is different, and each play-through can be as reinvigorating and relaxing as the last. The changing seasons morph the environment's landscape, and the music and sounds with it. Long summer days and cold winter nights are vastly different from each other, and each iteration of the game ends in a grandiose finale. If you are looking for a puzzle to solve, another player to outwit, or some other thing to keep you busy for 40 hours, this isn't the game for you. However, if you want to wash away your worries and explore a beautiful world, you should give Proteus a try."

Unlike Dear Esther though, each viewing is different, your islands are randomly generated. The graphics and sound are all perfectly simplistic and work oh so well in tandem. The only interactions are your movements and discoveries through the beautifully pixelated world. The sound especially is the draw, changing to different soothing tones based off your surroundings and season. While it's possible to see everything in a single island, you'll want to keep coming back to view it in a different setting. If you find something that takes your breath away, you can share the postcard (F9 ingame) with friends to let them explore the same island. If you're at all interested in interactive art, Proteus is a must play."

Despite the inability to directly interact(other than chase a few 8-bit animals) you get lost in a wonderful way. The music is superb and the fact it changes as you explore and interact makes it even more viable to pick up whenever you need to escape the world and forcefully enter a beautiful dream for as long as you need.If you are an action type person or require more than simple exploration, then I don't suggest this game.

Most of the game is seen in a single playthrough, yet I still find something I hadn't seen before, or have an experience that feels distinct quite often.A very serene, beautiful, and meditative game.Moving away from the norm and shooters, into more experimental areas. People argue this isn't a game, but then what is it? A painting?Games on their most loose definitions are; audio, video, and a simulated interactive world. So games like this, Gone Home, Dear Esther, and Mountain all qualify, and there is no doubt in my mind that they are games. It's just that people are so force-fed on shooters and action that they define it by violence and conflict. If you can't even die, how is it a game, right? Yeah. These are games; they're just not action games.Of course, there's plenty of room for more action-oriented titles.. it's just been so overdone that it's rare I find an action game that's interesting, and it's usually the ones with unique concepts, like NeonXSZ's Descent style 6-axis of freedom, or the various procedurally generated shooters like Heavy Bullets and Fancy Skulls.By all means, continue to debate on how Modern Warfare 3's multiplayer is so very different because of the seconds they spent making slightly different firing patterns on the guns, and how 4 round bursts are such a huge rebalancing over 3 round bursts.Finally, sorry about all this ranting. It is both habitual, and it's a topic that comes up in the games that are truly unique, creative, with the greatest merrit going for them; people feel the need to debate that it's not even a game because you can't even shoot anything in the face.Games like Halo and Call of Duty are the dime-a-dozen action movies of games. EA is Michael Bay; you know what they do is♥♥♥♥♥♥before they even say what they're doing, but it's profitable♥♥♥♥♥♥people pay for.. finally, these sort of games, classified often with condescending genres like ""walking simulator"", are developers going away from easy low-effort settings and action stories, and actually doing something worthwhile with the medium.It is easy to create, and satisfying to play a story about violence. Ones about something else take more thought, effort, and engage the player.If the player is willing to be engaged. On my final note: you have to go in with the right attitude.

There isn't an AI telling you to rescue a PoW, or an old man giving quests.Proteus simply has one task, and that's bringing the player back to, ironically, nature. You take the place of an unkown being, and simply spend your entire playtime exploring a randomized island made almost entirely of right angles. Along the way, you're greeted by trees, frogs, owls, and much more. Temporal changes also encompass you, as your duration of one session will dictate night and day, and even the seasons. Simple movement controls take the sophistication out of what you'd call a ""game""; letting WASD do the work.Proteus boasts itself in two areas: visuals and audio. Surprisingly, the nearly 8-bit art design does well, and no fancy lighting effects or graphics to the subatomic pixel grade are necessary to proclaim this one of the more visually appealing things I've seen. The audio is nothing out of Roc Nation's professional recording studios, and you could probably make it yourself, yet how come it's one of my favorite aspects of the game? The audio reflects your journey throughout the island, changing as you climb mountains or rest on the beach. It's calming, artificial, yet real.The developers of Proteus had one key word in mind during this project, and that is simplicity. Nothing too fancy (not saying fancy is bad) in all aspects of a ""game"", and it works in its favor.Is Proteus only for hippies and tree huggers? No.Is Proteus for gamers? Yes and no.Is Proteus for people who want a change of pace in video games, as well as real life? Yes.I'd give Proteus an 8.5/10 ($10 is hard to justify, wait until it goes on sale or part of a humble bundle).After raging at Counter Strike, slaying demons, or even studying, Proteus is a calming way to reconnect yourself with sanity and holocene.(For full experience, play it in the dark with your headphones.

That said, if you give it the time it deserves, it will be a rewarding experience.It's basically a walking simulator, you're on an island and how you interact with the world around you (read: where you walk/how you explore/do you explore) is really up to you. I do strongly recommend playing the game with sound -it really adds to the experience. I, for one, spent a great deal of the first season chasing after various critters simply because of the sounds they made.Good way to relax, definitely worth the time. Give it a shot, if nothing else you can enter the debate of ""is this really a game""! ;)"

76561197980107643,Recommended,219680,8907307,"Posted: 29 January, 2014",all,Flailsnail,"ProteusProteus is a very interesting piece of work. I don’t call it a game because it doesn’t fit into that category in any traditional sense. It’s less of a game and more of an experiment in musical exploration. After giving it a try for a few hours and seeing a bit of what it offers, I feel confident giving it a solid recommendation for those of you who are looking for something a little different. Allow me to explain why, and perhaps snag your interest.Proteus begins simply; you open your eyes. You find yourself standing waist deep in the ocean, and can just make out an island off in the distance in front of you. Naturally, you will make your way towards it. Upon reaching the island, it becomes clear that there are some key differences between Proteus and other games. For starters, there is no music until you reach the island. Once you arrive and the music starts to play, you are in for a treat. It is all generated procedurally by what is around you. Frogs, toads, birds and even flowers all play their own notes as you move around and interact with each of them. These sounds combine to form very relaxing musical numbers. The soundtrack, as a result, is a fascinating part of the game. It is in part created by you, the player, and thus becomes a form of gameplay by itself. It’s a brilliant idea put into great use by the developers.So how about the rest of the gameplay then? It’s equally strange. Upon setting foot on the island, you are left entirely to your own devices. At no point do you ever see text, receive an objective, or have a designated goal handed to you. You are entirely on your own. And that’s exactly how it should be. Explore, find hidden little secrets and tidbits and write your own story! When you are prepared to quit, you don’t simply press escape and use a menu to quit. Instead you hold down the escape key, and your eyes begin to close. Quitting is represented as returning to sleep. When you’re ready to play again, you once more open your eyes and find yourself standing waist deep in water, with an entirely new, procedurally generated island waiting for you in the distance. Each new game is a new day, a new world, and a new opportunity for discovery.I personally came away from Proteus filled with wonder, and far more relaxed than when I went in. It is almost meditative rather than being tense and stressful. For anyone with an open mind looking to try something new, Proteus is a fantastic and beautiful way to relax and pass the time. There’s nothing else quite like it on the market. The most closely related comparison would come from last year’s Playstation 3 exclusive title, Journey, by ThatGameCompany, and that is a glowing comparison to a fantastic game. Proteus is a great little title in a sea of big-budget blockbusters, and should not be overlooked. Give it a shot, you may find yourself pleasantly surprised."

Sometimes we forget that video games are an experience we pay for, like go-karting, drugs, etc. Proteus is something special. It gives you something you didn't even realize you needed. There is no plot, no dialogue, no quests, no lore, no fall damage, no achievements, no interacting with items - the closest thing to interaction is the spacebar has you lay down and walking near certain objects activates some things. You don't HAVE to do anything. Proteus is about you, your thoughts, and a very lovingly-created world that you never knew you had always wished existed. Have you ever had a dream you loved being in, and then woken up saddened that it wasn't real? Did you think afterward of the excitement it stirred in you to explore this new world? That is where this game takes it's bliss.It's a world where everything has it's own voice. You awake in the water and make your way to an island. The trees in the forest sing in daylight and hum at night. You spot some chickens and chase them about the forest (incidentally, this is how the game began for me and I'm unashamed to say I was giggling the whole time). Wistful clouds appear on the purple horizen as the moon rises. Speck by speck you see the stars dot the sky, some unhinging from the starscape and meandering off in whatever direction pleases them most. Proteus is a world where you have no worries. The only thing to do is frolic. Don't worry, nobody is around to judge you. Nobody needs your help right now. It's okay to feel peace.If any of what I've said resonated with you, buy Proteus and thank yourself. You've earned this."

It's an experience.It combines two elements - sound and vision - to create a uniquely moving and personal experience as you roam a small island. You don'tdoanything. You explore your own personal world, one that teems with surprises. You won't forget the first time you walk through a creaking forest at night and an owl hoots at you form a nearby tree. Nor will you forget the first time you stepped atop a mountain. The first sunrise actually set the hairs on my arms on end.It's about exploring what Proteus has to offer with your eyes and ears. Both sounds and sights are simultaneously abstract and magnificent, drawing the traveller deeper in. You could find yourself chasing a bunny for the strong notes it creates versus a melodic background, or simply sitting under a tree watching a sunset, admiring the view and ambience.As I said, Proteus is an experience - if you don't give it the time it deserves, you won't feel it as you should, you won't be drawn in as the developers intended. If you want instant gratification, go play CoD. But if you want something a little deeper, a little more personal, something that isn't all about the numbers, give Proteus a try.Starman"

There are really, a lot of redeaming qualities, and I often do like exploration based gameplay, it's just that there's not a lot to see here.What there is to see is nice. I love the art direction, the world is just flat out breathtaking. So much life is made through a very simple ""8-bit-esc"" art style. Despite there being not much life on the island (there is some), it just feels very full and vibrant. The sound design tops the visuals though with just a beautiful ""8-bit-esc"" ambiance and sound effects.The problem I have with suggesting this game though is that not everyone in the world is a fan of what is essentially virtual tourism. You see great sights and hear very pleasent noises, but that's it. If anything, it is more like a painting with a soundtrack which you can walk through, which is not an inheriently bad idea. I would feel better about this game if there was more honestly, but despite random generation of the island, it doesn't offer much variety. Luckily I got it for $2, which feels like the perfect price to me.But for the $10 price, I would not reccomend it. While I'm sure the creator worked hard on the game, there is not enough content to warrent the price tag. But hey, it's better than Dear Esther.

There's an ending of sorts, but the entire game is calm, slow, plotless, but graphically stunning in its low-resolution way. Certain vistas made me gasp or smile when I moved through them.  The music is also procedural, setting ambient electronic mood that matches perfectly with the visuals.  I like to just run it in the background to play the music.Proteus is digital antidepressant and well worth experiencing from time to time when you need to destress.NOTE: On Mac OS X, it took over a minute of black screen at the beginning before it came up - just be advised to wait without any kind of feedback before the title screen.

I came to play this after some darker themed games like Dishonored and Papers, Please and I felt it a nice change of scenery. Honestly the game shouldn't take you more than 90 minutes to see everything.Don't expect something new and innovative with this game.

The artwork, sounds, and music are very good for the most part, and the first half of the game makes you curious and intrigued as to what different sights there are to see on the island and how to interact with different things that you find (as the game offers no instructions or tutorial, but instead lets you find out how to play and explore Proteus on your own.)The second half of the game, however, is very dull and boring, and these negative aspects worsen until the game finishes. Also, after 1 or 2 playthroughs, you've pretty much seen everything, as Protues is a very short title that should take less than an hour to complete, and there's no incentive to play again. In fact, the painfully dull second half of the game may DETER players from exploring Proteus again.In short, the first half of Proteus is quite well done, but considering the boring second half and lack of replay value, the positive qualities of this game are not enough to recommend a purchase."

It has wonderful music to go along with the game's many sights. I truly enjoyed the game despite a short playthrough time and I would say average replay value unless you want to discover every little detail of the island generation which I personally wish to do sometime soon. Overall the game may take 45 minutes to two hours depending how long you spend in each season. The 10 USD (~7 EURO) price tag is a little large for this game, so I would wait for a sale like I did so you can get Proteus for a fifth of that price.

If you try to ""beat"" it, you'll walk right past the game.Few games make you smile or laugh for sheer joy at what's happening. Few game make you gape in disbelief.

The tree that wraps you in a warm circle of light in the dead of night.I found a little cabin in the woods. Being a gamer, I tried to interact with it: tried to open the door, get on the roof, anything. I realised it was just a rectangular prism with a triangular prism on top and a paint job, so I walked away. I walked up a mountain and got caught in a rain storm. I found two ""rabbits"" having a singing contest. I walked around the mountain some more and the sun started to come up. And there was the cabin. I sat down (I found the ""sit"" button) in front of it, under a tree, as the sky started to lighten. And the sky did this incredible shade-shift as this huge orchestral sound swelled epicly around me.I'd been playing for a while and had seen a few sunrises. This one was *different*. The game seems to pay attention to what you're doing in ways other games don't, and it responds to you. I'm almost certain that if I hadn't been looking at that unique object, while sitting, while the sun rose, I wouldn't have heard that kind of dynamically-generated musical score.The game is worth the price.

The clever idea is that everything in the visual landscape reflects itself in an audio landscape that you wander through at the same time.  As the weather and the seasons change the music reflects in this.  Blooming trees lead to resonant earthy sounds,  wondering past gravestones leads to ominous bass notes and falling rain leads to precussive tinkles.  All in all the video and audo worlds collide beatifully, and is a thoroughly meditative experience.  I've not experienced anything quite like it.Ultimately though this feeling wore off rather quickly and just lead to boredom.  I wondered around for the best part of an hour and let the game reach its conclusion.  I can't deny that this was a work of art, and a lovingly crafted calming diversion.  I respect it for trying to be different, its an experimental album if you will, and the world is a better place for having things like this.

I don't know what I actually thought I'd see, probably nothing amazing, but it ended up being a really ugly old fat man in a one piece bathing suit and an XXL long sleeve green tshirt around ""her"" legs, sitting at the bottom of a disguised dunk tank. I paid one dollar and fifty cents to see that man and this game disappointed me more.Its exactly what you'd expect, except with less going on. It's peaceful, but if that's what you're into, hiking in real life is free at a lot of places and the rabbits are more than 4 pixels. It was the anticipation that made me hate it, if I just stumbled across this for free, coded into a web page, I'd probably play for five minutes and then stop and be like, ""Hey, that was sort of cool.""You can press Q, and it auto-walks forward, and you just look around with the mouse with really not much other than trees to see, aside from a few graves, and the changing time of day. I think a lot of people are arguing that this is art, or this game is just trying to be different and show that you don't need goals or objectives, but from my perspective, many of those people are just fighting the norm, playing the devil's advocate. I can't see someone spending more than 20 minutes max on this game.Overall: 2/10 for being pretty."

Proteus was a game I was excited by when I learned about it which was a long while ago. It's been at least a year or two since I heard about it and I got it on the summersausagesales. I liked it. It was rather immersive and the sfx was fantastic with the stuff you could interact with. I think I do wish there was more you could interact with and that my first playthrough would be longer and more eventful (but it was still mindblowing) I did very much enjoy this game. It affected my dreams when I went to bed the day of playing the game. Maybe I'll write more about this game soon but this is my basic review of Proteus. I don't recommend getting it for full price since I found the game to be short though.

I came back to it today wandered around for a bit and then after a while I started to understand what it was about.When I came back to it this time, I didn't try and do anything, I just wandered around, and then I understood what I was supposed to do - which was just to wander around!This isn't a game about competition, its not a game with much of a story, its not a game about self-improvement, but it is Art."

Before I go further, I'll say I'm a sucker for interesting art styles and good music. The reviews on Proteus and the Summer Steam Sale convinced me it was time to give it a go. I smoked, fired up Steam, and embarked on my journey into Proteus.I was delighted with every little creature I came across. Some animals were recognizable, others were alien to me. Each creature emanated its own ethereal melody; not a single bit of negativity to be seen. The pixelated art encouraged me to use my imagination to fill in the blanks--tabula rasa, if you will. Before long, I began to feel the anxiety of having no objectives, or even a button to interact with my surroundings, creep into my psyche. But when I found a group of singing pink mushrooms that popped down into the earth at my approach, only to pop back up nearby, I was satisfied to just experience the land. It became refreshing to not have to put forth effort to have a lovely experience, like receiving a massage. As for the circle of mysterious stone statues, the gravestones littering the land, the cabin in the woods, or the mother tree at the foot of the mountain...the lore behind them was whatever I want it to be. I learned to bepresentin the moment.This game reminded me a bit of Flower, the game that many folks insisted was not a game, but more of a toy. But the message behind Flower is the same I received from Proteus; sit back, relax, experience, and do or don't do whatever you like.My only frustration with this game is the mouse sensitivity. Even turned all the way up, I would have to lift my mouse up off the mousepad at least 10-20 times to turn around and go back the way I came. It definitely fudged with the flow of the game and introduced frustration where there had previously been calm delight. At times, I was so annoyed that I wanted to put the game down, but wanted to see it through to the end--and there IS an end.I can see many traditional hardcore gamers getting frustrated with this game. Many might perceive it as empty, devoid of any sense of accomplishment or productivity, with the beautiful art and lilting music being small compensation for the cost. Unfortunately, I think a large majority of gamers simply won't want to find the headspace to enjoy this game to its fullest, hence my hesitation to recommend it. If you can read the reviews and know Proteus is your cup of tea, buy it, mate! If you're still cautious, wait for it to go on sale and buy it for a few bucks."

,Recommended,219680,368902,"Posted: 20 July, 2013",all,Brian Reynolds,"Commenting on a game like this almost requires someone with a proper sense of poetry, because artful words are necessary to communicate the experience.  Proteus isn't a ""game"" in any sense of the word but rather a literal experience to discover and explore.  To that end I encourage you to play this in a manner which best allows you to immerse yourself and let Proteus BE your world for a little while.  Play in the dark with headphones on and toss out your preconceived ideas for what you should see and do.If you can approach Proteus in this way you'll find a tangible sense of wonder and intrigue as you are presented with details that are both familiar (land, trees, mountains) and unfamiliar like pixel presentations that alter your perception of what's normal along with an everpresent sense of music and interplay as your participation in the world changes the experience.  There are sights and things here to capture your imagination if you spend the time to take the world on its own terms.With that being said Proteus is rather short and repetitive.  The whole world is procedurally generated which in theory means that every time you play you'll be greeted with an entirely different island than you ever visited before, but there are certain rules about the lay of the land which remain consistent and so the wonderful sense of new discovery can fade over repeated plays.  This doesn't diminish the enjoyment of the game any more than repeated trips to your favorite campground at a national park can make you tired of going back, but one of the primary appeals is that sense of discovery where you're confronted with a world that's simultaneously familiar but alien....so despite playing the game several times now I still feel like there's more yet I haven't found.  I'll come back again."

Clearly if you are solely into ""traditional"" game structure you will not really enjoy your experience because you will be trying to achieve something or wondering if you ""beat"" it. The game isn't going to give you that feedback; it won't pat you on the back or give you an achievement for interacting with a new creature or playing through multiple times because that is not the point of this game. The ""point"" is whatever the you want it to be; you are playing solely because you want to, there are not really many ulterior motives. The game creates an immersive atmosphere through visuals, audio, and minimal interactive elements, and it is up to you what you do with that. If you don't like it, don't play it. If you do, keep enjoying and exploring.I understand that this is an extremely polarizing game, but one thing that many people who negatively review it are missing is that they claim to have ""completed"" the game in 30 minutes, and are disappointed about not getting their ""bang for their buck."" But the problem is you can't ""complete"" Proteus. There is no built in goals or achievements.  Experiencing one cycle does not constitute anything really in terms of objective progress; everything you gain from your playtime is subjective, it is up to you what you gain (or if you gain anything) from your playtime.I'll admit $10 may be a bit pricy for this title, however it is entirely your decision to buy this and enough is known and has said about this game where you know what you're getting into if you are purchasing it. I personally loved the couple run throughs I have experienced and definitely plan on revisiting Proteus periodically. For me it is a beautiful little escape where everything is familiar yet new, and in just 30 minutes I am given a feeling of catharsis that I may not even be able to understand, but it feels beautiful every time."

HOWEVER, people pay thousands for paint splattered on a canvas, and Proteus is most definitely an art piece, and a very stunning one at that. As such, I couldn't recommend this enough for cheap art."

Judging it as that I would've preferred VR support and some mellow music instead of the hydro it came with and a $5 price tag for the 1 hour you'll pull from it. If it had that wrapped up in a bundle I could recommend this wholeheartedly to damn near anyone. It would be a fantastic way to escape after a tough day at work.At its current price or considered as a game rather than an experience it's a little difficult to recommend. But since it'll only take an hour to play through it and see if it's right for you (and that's well within steam's refund policy) I'd say give it a try.

Although there is no main goal to this game it has the feel to it like i'm in a different world!I may not recomend this game for everyone, people who like to acomplish goals and mission this is not the game for you, but if you need to relax and want to have some peace this game is theorpy !!!!!"

You don't have any quest or objectives other than to explore the land around you. Of course after a while you will get bored, however this game is not meant to be a game you play for very long. Just explore the environment and give it a chance so you can explore all the seasons. Its a beautiful environment, and it kind of makes you happy. However this is not a game for everyone, and it can get boring fast. If you can get it for $2 or under I'd say its worth."
