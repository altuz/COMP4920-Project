Every single time you start a new game file, it's an entirely random generated world where nothing is the same as the last. You can play this game for weeks and still not discover all its secrets. It's a sandbox strategy game that keeps you on your toes for anything and everything that's trying to kill you. And believe me, there's a hundred and one monsters who all want your face on a platter.GAME TIPS:1. Always have a means to make fire. Always.2. Pigs are your friends. Build your base near them.3. Spiders are not.4. BEWARE THE BEES.5. Beefalo herds are awesome. Fill your pockets with their endless poo. Great fire fuel.6. Prepare for periodic hound attacks. Make spears and tooth traps.7. Pick flowers.8. Not starving is the LEAST of your worries."

Let me explain:When I saw the game I were like ,,Naahhhh I'm not going to buy this.'' but a few days later I looked a second time and tought ,,Why not?It looks funny. And it says you can celebrate with your piggy friends.''  that was when I bought it. I can tell you I got addicted to the game. The first day I played 12 h's. I told my brother and my friend they should buy it. They did it and got addicted, too. I think nearly every Computer can run the graphics and the the characters are funny, too. With every game I started a new story war born. For example I started my first game and forgot to make a fire when the night came up I died and I was like,,Why?Ishould have know''. And I learned with every new day that the game hates me. The game likes to punch you in the face. And the community is amazing. In the forums you can see artist, storywriters, survivers and so on.

76561198010860571,Recommended,219740,19050889,"Posted: 13 November, 2015",all,dog not understand art,"This game is fantastic.It combines roguelike and survival gameplay, dumping you in a strange territory to explore, forage, learn, craft and progress on your own terms. For the most part, the controls and interface are intuitive, so it's simply a matter of deciding where to go or what to do.The game is called Don't Starve, and hunger is indeed a major theme. If you go a few days without food, you will die. That said, there are plenty of other things to kill you - a variety of animals and monsters, environmental hazards, and your own dwindling sanity. To battle this, you rely on building your own equipment, consumables and structures, ranging from weapons and armor to crock pots to unwholesome magical devices.Don't Starve can be brutal, so you should expect to die, but just making good progress is rewarding in itself. You unlock new characters as you play, each with little touches or specialties to diversify your experience. And while there are some pretty powerful or useful items you can make, there are still a lot of ways to play, and they're all valid (which is good, because sometimes you don't have much choice.)If you're bored or frustrated, you can change your experience by starting a new game and adding or removing features. If you're tired of fighting certain monsters, you can just turn them off. I haven't messed with this myself, as I like the feeling of surprise, and playing the game as-is, but the developers have left the doors wide open for custom play experiences. In the same way, you can make use of a wealth of user-created elements.There are a few things I missed for awhile, like the fact that you can view a map of everywhere you've been so far, but overall the game doesn't suffer much from lack of tutorial or hand-holding. You can go read everything on a wiki if you prefer, but this is a game where I don't actually begrudge trial and error learning. Encountering strange new things and deciding what to do with them is a ton of fun, even if it sometimes gets you killed.A warning (at least from my perspective) - this game is so immersive, I prefer to keep playing it for hours on end once I start. It's not a game I enjoy having to stop, unless I come to good stopping point like dying at the end of a long survival run. In fact, sometimes I forget to eat for a long time when I play this. So, yeah. Irony."
,Recommended,219740,14911972,"Posted: 15 March, 2015",all,ownosourus,"Boy Scouts should be required to play Don't Starve before going on any camping trips – they could even get a badge for it, in the form of a gaping, pointy-toothed wormhole. Or maybe a friendly campfire.Don't Starve is, at its most basic level, a survival game. It features crafting, mysticism, science and all manner of nasty creatures, especially once it gets dark. In order to stay alive, players have to use the surrounding flora and fauna to craft increasingly complex tools, starting with a simple axe and building up to items as intricate as lightning rods and carpeted flooring.When you die in Don't Starve, your current world is destroyed, along with the things you created while surviving in it. There are advanced tricks to escape death – constructing a Meat Effigy or finding an Amulet – but rest assured that you will most likely die before gaining the experience required to craft or dig up these items. A Touch Stone will also resurrect fallen players, but finding that structure early on is more luck than certain death. I did find it, at the beginning of my second run, but I didn't know what the strange circle surrounded by pig heads was, so I didn't use it, and when I died, I was dead.That said, curiosity and a desire to poke at unfamiliar things are essential in Don't Starve.Dying is a fundamental gameplay aspect. Death won't always come from starvation; it inhabits many forms, including beasts large and small, and the terrors that hide in the night. A clock-like status bar in the upper right corner of the map shows how many days you've survived and the current time, and it provides health, hunger and mental gauges. It's an efficient system, the clock hand moving from yellow to red to blue – day, afternoon and night – and circles of health systems draining without proper care. One glance and it's instantly clear how long until you have to build a fire, or if you need to eat or rest.On top of a solid survival game, Don't Starve is a deep, layered experiment in crafting and exploration. Throughout the biomes are wormholes that transport players to different lands, which offer new materials for building science machines – which unlock new crafting recipes – and heartier structures. New characters are unlocked with experience – 20 points per day survived. This is all in Sandbox Mode, but Don't Starve also features an Adventure Mode, which players can enter by finding and activating Maxwell's Door. Adventure Mode is Don't Starve's campaign, pitting Wilson against Maxwell, the demonic genius who brought Wilson to the wilderness in the first place. It's five grueling chapters – upon first entrance, players lose all items and crafting recipes, and can only carry four items between Adventure Mode chapters. Die in Adventure Mode and you're spat back out into Sandbox Mode, precisely where you left it.For its art style, deceptively dark vibe and experimental approach, Don’t Starve is certainly worth a look."
,Recommended,219740,16125866,"Posted: 1 June, 2015",all,Dr. Frog ☭☢,"Don’t Starve tries its best to be a haunting challenge, with a Tim Burton art style. It does a good job.The core gameplay is simply trying to survive. gathering materials and food during the day, and huddling by a fire, trying to craft useful tools at night. As the day to night cycle progresses, so does the seasonal cycle. After a couple days, winter comes, making it harder to collect food, and hunt. The nights become longer and the days become shorter as you huddle by your fire, trying not to freeze to death. During winter, your homemade farms stop becoming useful. Huntable animals disappear and other more dangerous animals come in swarms.As far as the story goes, there is an oddly rich story, which can only be experienced by skilled players. Whenever a new game is started, Maxwell, the games antagonist, warns him to get food. The real story mode cannot be achieved unless the player has found the four pieces, and then moves to the next level. After beating a few levels, they reach the epilogue, where maxwell is unlocked as a playable character and the game is complete.Don't starve’s graphics and art style is very Tim Burton. The monsters, alone have a scary but yet cute feel to them. The sound of the game is very creepy yet welcoming. depending on what the player is doing at the time. The music changes whenever the player is in combat or not, making the combat feel even more immersive.Don’t stare also has a large amount of options. Not only can you pick your character but you can also modify the world and its many resources. Players can make the world a food rich wonderland, or a barren wasteland, randomized each time. Each playable character has its own stats, and buffs/debuffs, tailoring to each possible playstyle.The in game crafting provides a large variety of machines, tools, farms and structures. The player can craft anything from carpets, campfires, spears, drying racks, walls, bee-based mines and a large variety of clothing, all with special perks. Winter coats to keep you warm, mining hats to provide light, feather hats to increase how many birds there are, armour to reduce damage, and a flower garland to keep sanity up.Don't starve does lots of things right.The art style and sound design is amazing for this gameThe crafting feels organic and worth the effort.The clothes in the game change not only how the player looks, but also has bonuses.The Monsters in the game are interesting and fun to hunt.The many varieties of food make the game more interestingThe story is enjoyable, even if you don't play through it.The antagonist is one of the best “bad guys” i've seen in games for a whileThe different playable characters are fantasticThe game has a customizable world setting.The game has playing cardsDon't starve does a few thing wrong.The cave mechanic is hardly explored until late gameThe game has a few bugs still needing to be fixedThe follower mechanic should be touched upThe vanilla game can be a tad boringThe player may rage-quit after dieing on a long time world.The game lacks achievementsThe game lacks vanilla co-opDon’t Starve isn't only a magnificent survival game, but it is also a well told story, for those who care to play it. I believe that there is a large market for this game, and that market keeps on growing. If you don't already own this game, pick it up on sale. Its on sale almost every winter and summer sale. I payed full price for it and i think its worth it."

Found Touchstone, learned to abuse savestate mechanics. Dying becomes nearly impossible.> Winter came. I died.Don't Starve is a creepy-cute survival game in which you're made to learn through mistakes, and in which the slightest mistake can kill you and erase all your progress. I'm currently 74 days into a run, but not without a little abuse of the game mechanics. Don't Stave is a hard rogue-like, in that the instant you die your entire world and all your progress is erased, but there are a couple resurrection items in each world that let you respawn once after death, and I've found that there's a few seconds between dying and resurrection in which you can safely quit the game without it saving over your file. Basically, it's the old Pokemon trick: if you accidentally kill the legendary, just reboot your save file and everything's fine.Is this cheating? Probably. Kind of. Not as much as the time I played through this game's entire adventure mode with God Mode turned on because I so badly wanted the character you unlock at the end. (I know, I'm THAT kind of player. In my defense, the adventure mode of this game is just absurd.)I've put more hours into this game than into all my other games combined, and I think that fact alone should show how fun it is. It's a sandbox game, in that there are no set objectives, but there are so many things to do in the game that forming your own objectives is easy and natural; it's pretty obvious when you run across something you haven't accomplished yet (surviving through winter; unlocking the Magic tab; collecting the parts to the Teleportato), and in order to accomplish it, you usually have to master some new aspect of the game. In my current save file, I have: survived two winters; walked around the entire overworld map; hunted down MacTusk; survived (and slain) the mighty Deerclops; and built a base with six farms, two bee boxes, and a nearby spider den, which I'm pretty sure could sustain me indefinitely without me having to move beyond my line of berry bushes. All this and I've still only scratched the surface. (Literally; there's a whole cave world below the surface world, and a ruin world below that, which I've only read about so far.)The only downside to this game is the roguelike element, in that every time you die you have to start over. But the randomly-generated world makes starting over kind of fun, especially with the option to try new characters, and once you have the basic survival tools there's a million directions you can go in, most of which you won't have touched in previous playthroughs.I will say, however, that the dying does get annoying, especially when so many of your deaths feel like ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Like those eyeball plants that attacked and killed me before I could figure out what they were. Or the wolves, which will NEVER stop chasing you, or even give you time to craft something to defend yourself. Or all those times a monster attacked my campsite at night, forcing me to run in circles around my fire as the light slowly burned out. Basically, if at any moment you aren't prepared for everything, it probably means you're about to die. The only reason I can ignore this is that I would quickly quit my game whenever I was about to die, but without cheats, the permadeath mechanic makes progress in this game infuriatingly difficult (but incredibly rewarding when it does happen).I'd give it an 8/10. (10/10 if savestate abuse is counted as a game mechanic.)"

You're low on food and sanity so you start picking up these berries which you haven't thought about doing in the beginning, and you also found flowers. You try eating them but notice that whenever you pick'em up your sanity raises. that's good.After a while of looting the enviorment you come across a rock biome. Great, you've gathered enough rocks to make yourself nothing because the night came again.After almost dying at night you start getting stone and come across a gold nugget. What could that be?And, again, a bulb ontop of the symbol of Atom has caputred your eye.You make a science machine as you start grapsing that basics of this game. After a while of exploring your general land you come across a pig village with, ofcourse, the king pig inside. These pigs will turn out to be your only allies in this game. They have farms, they offer protection for any kind of meat and will save you from some of the horrors of this game. So you start making your base next to them as it is the only logical choice you could make in this game.After more days of looting and gathering resources you hear a faint woof. What could that be?Hounds.As you run relentlessly without understanding what's going on, your fellow pigsman are there to save the day, not for long though. You came out clean this time, which you should thank the gods of this cursed land.You started making up a base, you crafted random items from the science tab and again, a bulb has lit up.You craft an alchemy engine which will help you craft more scientific items.After roaming around in the world yet again, you come across ancient guardians of this cursed land.They work like clockwork, they defend their land like no other creatures. You bribe your fellow pigsman and you go to fight these ancient creatures, winning the battle.After looting their corpses, you come across gears. When arriving at your house, you craft an Ice Box to slow the spoilage of the food. Neat.You have a base, well protected from the horros of this world, you have everything you'd like in it.Now, there are two scenarios which can happen:1. Summer starts.You have no idea what to do, your character starts to heat up without any knowledge on what's happening.Your house starts burning and you, yourself, is overheating.Okay, lets say that didn't happen and you miraculously didn't any fires or didn't overheat because you mined ice.Guess what?Dragonfly. I'll leave that for you to discover what's that.Scenario 2:Winter starts.Great, you're cold, you're almost dead but you came across a failed survivor which had a Puffy Vest, thermal stone and a Cat Cap. How lucky you are. So you barely survive this day and come back to your house, rapidly fueling your campfire as it's the only gateway from this hellish environment. You have food in your ice box, you have enough wood somehow to survive the winter (Who am I kidding, this never happends, but for the purpose of this story let's assume it does).A saxphone sound comes out of your characters body and a text appeares, ""That sounded big"".I'll let you guess what's going to happen next.Ofcourse, there are 2 more seasons, Autumn and Spring, but I feel like they shouldn't be focused on now as they are pretty similliar.You die.Again.And again.And again.And again, until you master the horrors of this cursed land, feeling success after surviving your first winter, summer, autumn, spring. You survive the countless waves of hounds. Great.You come across a sinkhole.I'll let you find out what's going to happen next.All in all, this game is a well polished survival game with a giant replay value, very little bugs are found, great developers who listen to the community, great DLC's which add a LOT to the game which are very cheap aswell.If you like survival games and want to feel what a real survival game is, check this game out, it's on sale right now aswell.This game will always have a special place for me."

I have to say the mutliplayer is very fun, however can get tedious with long sessions.Action packed adventure game. This is probably a more realistic approach to what surviving is really like but with an obvious cartoony visual. This game requires its player to always be thinking about what to do next so that they can always be prepared for a bad situation. Don't Starve is a very fun and feels refreshing each time you play, the characters with unique abilities and the randomised maps help the game stay addictive and attractive for a long time. It has an absoultely huge variety of gameplay and things to do and explore.I would have to say the only two cons there are with this game are there is absolutely no chance of multiplayer (apparently something with the scripting idk) and that if you get ambushed by monsters, all your hard work will literally just disappear, aka sometimes its just too easy to die.9.2/10 definently my favourite indie game at the moment"

And then, come nightfall, deal with monsters.This game is equal parts stressful and fun. In directly proportional amounts.The lack of achievements just goes to show the game's focus: You can play this game however you want, change the spawning rate of specific plants and critters, the length of seasons, all of which would undermine achievements and their place in the community. But could make the game more fun, if you want to enjoy it that way.KLEI seems intent on polishing a single aspect of a game in each release, SHANK the action, Mark of the Ninja the stealth, and now Don't Starve the procedurality. Their previous games were tightly focused and linearly designed, but here we have something almost infinitely replayable. And incredibly unforgiving.Crafting, managing resources, and carefully avoiding conflict mean that long term you might manage to erect a homestead with a farm and wander the world with a loyal pet.

,Recommended,219740,28395343,"Posted: 15 December, 2016",all,Audish,"There's a definite element of horror to survival games. It could be the fear of a wild animal tearing apart your fragile corner of civilization, or simply the sickening realization that you planned poorly and you're going to starve to death. Don't Starve capitalizes on both of these fears and more, pitting you against a stretch of nature that isn't just inhospitable, but actively seeks your destruction. And if that sounds stressful and downright painful at times, you should have a good idea of what you're getting into.Don't Starve starts you off with a spread of characters to choose from (with more to unlock) and world customization options, and then deposits you into an isometric wilderness. Just about every object in the world is interactable and will become important to your survival and prosperity, but the initial steps are simple enough. Flint and twigs make tools for chopping wood and mining stone, which can be refined further into building materials that unlock new equipment options. You'll be setting up fully-featured camps but be aware that cabins and castles aren't in the cards... the best you can do is walls and some simple flooring.This feeling of permanent exposure is important to the atmosphere, because you are never fully safe in this cruel world. There's a pervasive sense of ancient evil to everything, from the twisted trees to the dead-eyed spiders to the writhing tentacles beneath the marshes. One key to survival is light, because without it the pitch-black night is certain death. I'm not just waxing poetic here, if you get caught in the dark for more than about five seconds, you die. But even a roaring campfire is no guarantee that marauding wolves, angry frogs, or far larger things won't end your life.Death is where the real tension of the game is, because death is permanent. No do-overs, no checkpoints, no reloads. When you die, that character and that world are gone. Now, permadeath has proven to work for short roguelikes but a game where you spend hours exploring a world and building a settlement is a whole different ballgame, and it's here that Don't Starve threatens to lose most of its audience. Dying in this game really, really,reallysucks, because it's always from something perfectly avoidable, comes so quick, and wipes out literal hours of progress.So why beat your head against this game? Because as long as you DON'T die, it's an excellent survival simulator. You'll never reach a point where you're fully comfortable in the world, and there are always greater beasts and scarier places to overcome. Even the most basic materials remain relevant as your mastery over the land grows, and while you gain new ways to make gathering resources quick and painless, you still have survival tasks to complete. Eventually you'll be cultivating farms, researching artifacts, and preparing for harsh winters, all of which are involved and gratifying goals.You'll have to deal with some trial and error in finding the best ways to survive and use what you find, and that can mean some frustration as you learn to deal with food spoiling or beekeeping or other surprisingly lethal pastimes. But once you do there's a big, strange world to explore, and that's really only the beginning. There's a story mode hidden out there in the wilds that you'll only find once you master survival, and getting through THAT is its own grand adventure. Wrapped up as it is in charming hand-drawn graphics and rich sound design, there's plenty to keep you invested in Don't Starve. It's a game that asks for a lot of patience and understanding, but it's one of the few that really earn it, too.Did you enjoy this review? I certainly hope so, and I certainly hope you'll check out more of them athttps://goldplatedgames.com/or on mycuration page!"

This game has received positive ratings from critics and users alike. Its mostly compared to other games like Minecraft and Terraria where the goal is survival. The main difference is that in those games mentioned above you are digging deeper and deeper and its usually about getting resources from the depths of the world. This game on the other hand is about utilizing resources on the surface for survival. Which brings about many difficulties as a result since you cannot hide in a cave for the winter.Difficulty:The permanent death component of this game really adds tension to surviving and trying your best to live the cruelty of the world. The difficulty really feels tailored made once you actually get into all the settings for making your own world. You basically have options over all enemies and resources to customize the world you desire in a fashion that you would want to explore it in. By having the player able to change the difficulty dependent on variables to such a degree they have made this game fun to replay over and over.WorldThe world can be medium to grand depending on what options the player chooses. However despite the size you end up with you will always feel like there is plenty to explore which is a important component of this game. The idea of exploring for resources, gathering them and utilizing resources to survive is important.CraftingThe crafting system was well done and has plenty of diversity of what you can create to enhance your odds of survival. Its interesting that you need the labs to first construct the objects but are able to construct them anywhere after your first time.GraphicsThe art direction is actually really good, the eeriness of the graphics combined with its other components really makes it stand out from other games, if you were to show me a ton of games i would never confuse it for don't starve."

I was confused and scared, yet somehow comforted by the man, probably due to the strong sence of security he held. I could roughly make out the words: ""Say pal, you don't look so good."" ""You'd better find something to eat before night comes!"" his figure then swiftly decended into the ground in a puff of smoke. I trembled, I had somehow braised my knee, as I rose to my feet, my head dizzy and aching. i didn't have a clue how I got here, I only knew that I had to find some food and some supplies to make it through the night. Frantically, I began to run across the luscious meadow in search of some food that I could ravage.After what seemed hours, I finally spotted a bush that contained some sort of red, exotic berry that I could pick. As I approched the bush It became clear to me that the berries could be poisonous, despite their decieving looks. However as I looked up to the sky and took a glimpse of the savage birds circling me, I saw that the only viable option, and inevitable, was to rob the bush of its resources. I reached for the crimson berries, my mouth watering, when out of the blue a majestic turkey looking creature sprung from the bush, stole the berries and made its escape with great speed. I set off to chase the gobbler, that is what I had come to call it due to its adept ability to steal berries, however realising it was beyond my reach, I took off in another direction looking for another cache of food.Hours later the sun began to set and the birds flew away to some distant land as if they were afraid of something. I had aquired a vast quantity of sticks, flintstones and grass tufts on my travels, but still no food. I had lost all hope on finding any source of sustenance and my chances of survival, yet the image of the dark, sleek man was the coal in the furnace of my shrivelled body. Suddenly a rare sight in this harsh world: a dead rabbit; mine for the taking. I lifted its limp corpse as saliva built up in my mouth. It was time. Without realising, a dark blanket covered the sky in a matter of seconds, envoloping my body in total darkness. But I didn't care. I became a feral beast and ripped into the lifeless rabbit with my teath, tearing its flesh from its body. However I felt a tickle on my leg, something had brushed passed me. I took no notice and continued with my soul rejuvenating meal. Before I realised my legs were ripped out of their sockets, cold blood splattering across my face. I screamed for help, but only recieved the soft, lonely chirping of the crows. I lay there for a few seconds reviewing the few hours I had lived, cuddling what was left of my rabbit, before my head was pulled from my neck in a slight struggle. In my last few seconds all I heard were the wicked screeches of the wind and the laughing of the dark, sleek man.Brilliant game with a fantastic community, I love this game and is one of my all time games.

It truly shines in comparison to the other modern survival games.The art style really fits with the game's setting, making for one of the best immersion experiences out there.Other survival games *cough* The Forest *cough* give you a handful of starting items and tips when you press the magnificent ""new game"" button.Well,no,♥♥♥♥ you, The Forest.In Don't Starve,you are told literally NOTHING about the enviroments that surround you,what can kill you, or what is edible.It is the authentic survival experience, where you wake up in the middle of nowhere, with absolutely no idea of what you are going to do next.That brings me to the learning curve. It is a really harsh and unforgivable one (Dark Souls style),but once you get used to it, and that should be after your first 5 worlds created, you will get the hang of what's what in the world of Don't Starve.Heat kills you, hunger kills you,spiders kill you,pretty much never ask yourself the question ""what does that thing do?"".You will regret it a short 10 seconds afterwards.Where the gameplay can't do the job, atmosphere is further more created by the Tim Burton-ish twisted art style,with a slight touch of a cartoon character design.This game is also a true teacher. In my humble 30-ish hours of trying not to starve, I learned that frustration never leads to something good,so don't get mad the first 5 times when you die,it's part of the game, and it's a healthy method of learning the ropes and the mechanics.Basically, the trial and error system would be the best description of your first playthroughs.The game is full of new content, it makes sure that you always discover something just when you tought that there couldn't be more to it, so don't worry, it is NOT a short game, nor one with an empty open world.The DLC, Reign of Giants and Shipwrecked, expand the content of it to whole new levels,easily adding 60 more hours of gameplay to the 50-ish of the original content and the 100+ ones that mods add, and (I can't believe I'm saying it), they are worth their full price.Verdict: If you want a serious survival game with tons of content and an expansive open world, tough with a harsh learning curve, but that is worth your time, Don't Starve is perfect for you.Actually,scratch that,Don't Starve is for you no matter what kind of survival game you are looking for.Just try it,because I'm giving it a 10/10."

The game sends them in at regular intervals, a larger number each time.  They're nothing more than an annoyance that come at inopportune times while you're trying to get other stuff done.  And if you screw up, that's it.  Hours of time down the drain, and you get to start over with the same (now tedious) tasks to survive.  There are things you can do to ""survive"" death, but it's still a pain to get right so you don't die again as soon as you respawn.I don't see a way to thrive in this game.  Everything you do just comes with new tasks to keep up every day.  Lots of rabbit traps?  Wait until they degrade and disappear.  Lots of farms?  They'll need seeds and eventually re-fertilized.  Everything breaks or spoils quickly.  Each day you survive is just a day closer to more hounds (or Deerclops) trying to kill you or break your stuff.I guess the game isn't about learning to thrive.  It seems to be about surviving long enough to get out.  One way or another it's just not what I want it to be."

Pretty much back when it was in beta, back before caves, back before rabbits had an ai. Watching it progress has been interesting.So this game is a survival... sorta horror game? It is hard to say it has things happen that are kinda creepy. The point of this game is to try to stay alive for as long as you can. It is easier said than done. Throughout the game you will have problems trying to stay alive. Hazards include hunger, wetness, heat, freezeing, monsters, giants, the dark, sanity, seasons, thunder, and fire. So basicly you start the game if you can survive long enough you will be able to get a little camp going and have enough food to live off of. But things in this game never go your way. Random mobs sometimes attack at the worst times, and bosses can randomly come and destroy your ""house"" and set your crops a blaze. This is basicly one of those games where you can be having fun and then your fun will be ruined and you will go sour on the game.

In this game you will die a lot and realize how much this game hates you. However, for every death you will gain knowledge of the game and experience to unlock other characters whom all are different and unique. You start off by collecting many items such as wildgrass and twigs so that you can survive for the first couple of nights but, the game get progressively harder with each passing night which makes this game so challenging. Once you die in this game, the game deletes your save file and you have to start all over from scratch but, the games world generator always keeps the game fresh and new for you. The community workshop also has many mods to help assist you in learning the game as well as adding new characters that already exist from other games,shows or even just made up.For some, Permadeath in this game is what ruins it. For others it gives the game a more realistic feel to the game. There are various guides and tutorials on Don't Starve but, I highly recommend not looking at it because the beauty of Don't Starve is finding out yourself the ups and downs. There are also various ways to give you an ""extra"" life such as touching the pig alter or the life giving amulet.Here are some of my experiences of the game:-1st time playing-Day 0: I spawn and start collecting items. I see a pig alter unsure of what it does and avoid it. I see an odd white sphere out of the ground and proceed to head towards it. I am ambushed by spiders and die.Day X (Can't Remember what day): I see the odd white sphere which I know now is a spider nest. I approach the nest and kill the first spider that greets me. The other 2 come out of the nest, eat the meat of their fallen brethren and proceed to chase me.Day 35: The Deerclops is chasing me and has killed all the beefalo with 2 hits. I proceed to shoot a fire dart at him which kills him, and starts burning all the drops from the beefalo. I run to the drops panicing and die to the fire from all the drops. I respawn from one of the pig alters that I had previously touched and immediately get ambushed by 6 hounds.Day 48: While I am collecting berries from the row of berry bushes I had gathered, it starts to rain. After a couple of minutes a lightning bolt hits one of the nearby trees burning all the bushes. Today is sad day.11/10 would attempt to survive again"

He disappears afterwards, abandoning you to your fate in the wilderness.And that is when the game starts off for real. Collecting red berries and wild carrots will satisfy your rumbling stomach for the first day, but night will come shortly, and only by the power of a roaring fire, can anyone survive the nightmarish abominations that hide in the shadows of the night. Morning comes, and the process repeats. Tree stumps are littered across the land, science machines are engineered, bases are built, seasons change, and just when you have it made, you die yet another stupid death. You try again, but as a different character, and out for revenge.The game's premise is simple and refined, but is a whole new misadventure every time. There are plenty of interesting characters to try out, and the map can be tailored to suit those seeking an easier time by spawning food supplies more abundently and by cutting down on the monsters, or made impossible by doing the inverse, and with settings to adjust the frequency of specific entities for those two and everything else in between.An expansive library of mods adds even more, with a broad sea of custom characters, items, tweaks, HUD elements, and more. The vanilla version already delivers an excellent survival experience, but no matter how much you add it will always be the same Don't Starve that keeps you on your toes and always on the run. The two well-recieved expansive packs are faithful to the spirit of Don't Starve, and transform the game into something that could have been a separate game in its own right, especially of what Shipwrecked offers.Overall, Don't Starve is a solid title. A multiplayer-geared sequel exists by the name of ""Don't Starve: Together"", but it lacks the Shipwrecked DLC, Adventure mode, and has slightly different stats for some characters and bosses. The latter does however features cosmetic clothing and some exclusive items and equipment, as well as the definitive multiplayer feature. Both are very similar to each other, but you can choose what best suits you, if not buying them both with a snappy discount.But regardless if together or not, don't forget the eponymous command, and that is don't starve."

A part of me really liked the game, while another was eagerly waiting to get off. Dont Starve is a survival game that blends a unique style of artwork with a fasinating story. By all means, the story is very well done and the gameplay is not bad, and if you like survival this is the game for you, but somewhere it just failed. It failed when it came to replay value, or how much you can play a game after you have finished it once. i felt that it started getting repetetive, doing the same things over and over for the same objective. Overall, i do recommend this game to anyone who loves survival, but i would only buy it if it were on sale."

NEVER.- You can customize your world - YOU pick if you want frogs, trees, rabbit holes, long day, long night, short winter, etc.- New characters to unlock - They have their own possibilities and personalities.- The game has got a sense of humor and nice graphics- It isn't really expensive and worth the moneyNegative things:- The game can get too stressful - If you build a big house with a fireplace, stone walls, science machine etc. and if you die... Well, you can get very disapointed.- Literally everything can kill you in this game - Even frogs!- After some time of playing you will simply get bored - But hey, you can always generate a new map!So yeah, Don't Starve is a very nice indie game.

Playing Don't Starve without the DLC Reign of Giants does not get old because there are so many map generated worlds to discover and characters to play that you can pit your skills in the game against the elements.  I like the fact that players can choose specific characters that all bring something unique into the game experience. For example, Mrs. Wickerbottom doesn't sleep and anything that is spoiling in her inventory affects and decreases her sanity so you have to think carefully about your food sources including the flowers in your garland! Players who want to add more of a challenge to the game edit their worlds. If you are a hardcore ""Don't Starver"" you can choose to play a preset world with harsher conditions, maybe add more spiders or Deerclops. It was definitely not fun to have one knock down my walls like dominoes. You can even select a world to play  that only has night as a setting. I just purchased the DLC Reign of Giants and I have already died twice due to the summer heat and me having no idea that the game would roast me in the summer sun, or the birds.

You are required to fend for yourself in this unforgiving land of permadeath and bees, and if you are the more casual sort of player i'd highly recommend giving the wiki a look as it may explain some things.You must fend for yourself, build a camp, set up crops and as the title implies...don't starve.But starving is the least of your worries. Everything in this game exists to murder you in ways you never thought possible. On top of that, you must worry about your sanity, temperature and health as well. Too many spider bites and you'll die. Been out in the night for too long? You'll go insane and even the shadows will be out to kill you.Oh look, it's become winter! Good luck, because you'll need to wear some nice warm clothes or you'll freeze to death!The game does have some less than lethal additions to it as well. You can come across villages of friendly pig men who you can befriend and trade with, which is wonderful since they are can sometimes be farmers, giving you free resources, food and even defence as the pig men are rather hostile towards monsters.This game really is bursting at the seams with content here and the maps are even randomly generated to ensure that no playthrough is like another. Even if you manage to ""beat"" survival mode by finding all of the tele-portato parts an exploring the cave systems for super duper loot, you can always play campaign for increasingly hard scenarios that are really fun as well.Avoid bees.Avoid all the bees."

Whatever the price, the lower the better. Just buy it. The DLC as well, especially the multiplayer standalone expansion: Don't Starve Together.Why?Because it's really well made right from the start. Don't Starve has a very robust system in place within the gameplay. Despite being a survival game, it plays out almost like a 4X strategy. To survive, you need to eXplore the world. eXploit its riches, eXpand yourself and your base of operation, and eXterminate the enemies that threaten your life. Except you're just playing a guy, not an empire or somethingThe visual is fantastic. It has a very distinguished art style that people can easily recognize. The animation is smooth like a cartoon on TV. The characters are all unique and plays very differently. The monster are varied with its challenge and the world, oh the world... It pose a lot of question. It begs to be explored.It's really great that the devs didn't cop out with retro pixel art like a lot of other indie game out there and it really shows. Very few of those game looks decent and most simply look terrible. Don't Starve is a proof that hiring actual artist is worth it.I absolutely have fun playing the game and can't reccommend it enough.EDIT: I nominated this game for Steam ""Steam Best Use of Farm Animal"" Award"

I played during the first days of release, and didn't give it enough time to get interesting. After sinking a ton of hours into this and still finding new things to want to check out, mess around with, explore and unlock, it's safe to say Don't Starve is a well made and interesting game.It's stacked with charm and intrigue.It still has a dead end in terms of discovery, tech and gameplay, like any survival or city sim game, but it's going to take you a lot longer to get there in Don't Starve than most other games. It's also fuelled by lots of strange little gameplay mechanics and items that you find along the way.I haven't even touched the DLC yet, and I'm not the greatest fan of survival games, but Don't Starve has definitely given me my moneys worth after investing a little time and effort.Pretty boring survival game. Don't Starve starts off with the same feeling you get playing Minecraft for the first time: You want to collect food and items to survive the first night and it's pretty exciting and fun.Unfortunately this is about it, and after the first few days of experimenting and finding out what everything does all you're left with is exploring and fighting. Fighting never really seems very exciting and has no real purpose other than maybe collecting items, and exploring seems like a waste of time since it doesn't help you survive any longer (which ultimately is the goal of the game). As a result this game gets boring very quickly and there doesn't appear to be much to do.Pretty boring survival game."

,Recommended,219740,30152251,Posted: 24 February,all,Lil Uzi Vert,"Like in any extreme survival situation, the early moments of Don't Starve's grueling-yet-fascinating struggle to stay alive are electric. Suddenly the clock is ticking. Confidence is high as you first explore a vast open-world wilderness teeming with danger. From trapping a rabbit for the first time to crafting an axe to chop precious firewood before nightfall, every minor accomplishment that keeps you ticking is immediately gratifying. But as the days draw on and dodging death's icy grip gets harder, the rigors of this unflinchingly brutal roguelike adventure chip away at your patience.Don't Starve casts you in the unfortunate role of Wilson, a scientist who has been mysteriously transported to a strange and deadly world by a demon-gentleman. With little more than a quick greeting, your adversary vanishes, and you're left alone to figure out how to stay alive. Story and dialogue are pretty minimal, aside from a few encounters in the super tough adventure mode, which is accessed by first locating a portal hidden in the randomly generated survival mode world. The hands-off nature of the story is a strength, allowing the heavy atmosphere and outstanding visual design of this grim land draw you in. There's little time for dalliances anyway. A great many things in the game's eerie world are out to kill you from the get-go.Survival doesn't come easy, but there's an undeniable thrill to the challenge. Your first few minutes of exploration hinge on harvesting whatever basic resources you stumble upon: a few twigs, some flint, rocks, a handful of grass. Collect enough of these raw materials, and you can make an axe, a torch, rope, a spear, and other crucial tools that increase your chances of survival. Don't Starve's deep resource harvesting and crafting system brings previous open-world games like Minecraft and Terraria to mind, and it's one of the game's strongest hooks. Figuring out how to put each item you collect to good use is a fun process of experimentation. Basic items are relatively easy to cobble together with minimal materials, though creating science and alchemy stations also pushes you further down the crafting rabbit hole by unlocking tons of more elaborate item recipes to pursue. Of course, staying alive long enough to build everything is another story.Dangers are frequently stacked against you in inventive and sometimes frustrating ways. Exploring, scavenging, harvesting resources, and building are best done in the day. Without a torch or a campfire to provide illumination when night falls, you will be torn to pieces by the demonic creatures that roam the darkness within seconds. Building a fire isn't enough either. You have to have enough wood or other fuel sources to keep it lit throughout the night, which creates a constant state of near panic every time the twilight phase of the day/night cycle arrives. Getting caught without the necessary ingredients for a fire or ample burnable materials to last the night spells instant doom.Changing seasons also usher in new problems to tackle. Live long enough, and winter rears its frosty head, bringing subzero temperatures that cause you bodily harm if you venture too far from a heat source. Admittedly, these interesting wrinkles add depth and additional difficulty to the already challenging survival mechanics at play. They sometimes tip the scale too far, however, particularly given the plentiful supply of other potentially life-ending obstacles thrown in your path.Managing your hunger, sanity, and health meters is a meticulous juggling act that demands a lot of your attention too. Food sources are often scarce, leaving you to scavenge berries, pull up wild carrots, and trap small animals early on to keep your belly full. While it's possible to build gardens and cook the meat of large beasts you slay to provide more-sustainable and gut-filling meal options, death by starvation is an omnipresent concern. When your stomach is completely empty, your health depletes rapidly until you die. Your sanity also depletes over time, and as it dwindles, you see more and more shadowy hallucinations and trippy visual effects. These hallucinatory creatures attack if you let your mental well run dry, and they're far from the only beasts you encounter.From giant cyclops birds and living tree monsters to carnivorous frogs and spiked tentacles, there are lots of creepy critters out there eager to end your existence. The rewards of battling them outright rarely feel like they measure up to the risk involved. Point-and-click combat is unfulfilling, since you basically stand there and whack away until someone dies. Often that's you. Slain foes may yield crucial ingredients for crafting and survival, but enemies are just as likely to kill you with a few quick hits before you have a chance to finish them off. Even docile critters can turn deadly with only the slightest provocation, since they tend to rally their pals in large numbers and come chasing after you en masse.Dying wouldn't be such a big deal if it didn't wipe your progress away permanently. While other roguelikes make it easy to get up and running, building a foundation for survival in Don't Starve is labor-intensive and monotonous at times. When you finally gain a decent foothold on survival after spending so much time chopping wood, scavenging sticks, and fighting for your life, losing it all in a split second is absolutely agonizing. You lose steam after being wiped out a few dozen times and forced to start the whole process over from a few twigs and berries. Every day you stay alive in each run does add toward your total experience points, but that only unlocks a handful of additional characters to play.Adventure mode ups the danger and frustration substantially too, since it requires you to hunt down pieces to assemble portals across five increasingly tough world maps. Die once in, and you're kicked back to Survival mode, outside a portal. Granted, when this cycle gets too irritating, you can manually tweak the frequency of most resources, monsters, and perils before starting a new run. But it's hard to find the sweet spot between painfully hard and absurdly easy, since having everything at your fingertips saps the enjoyment of foraging and crafting.The way Don't Starve blends its crafting, exploration, and survival elements makes for an enthralling and unique combination. This game will readily eat up many hours of your time if you let it, but the promise each run holds never seems to pan out thanks to the insidious challenges the game constantly stacks against you. The initial sense of wonder that comes from stumbling upon the surprises and discoveries of this interesting world rapidly fades away when you're stuck tackling the same menial tasks over and over again to regain lost ground for the hundredth time. It's disappointing, because Don't Starve otherwise packs a tremendous amount of charm, depth, and intrigue."

I'm 21 now and I can tell you that this is one of the best games I have played in my entire life.With that said, I want to tell you why this game is so good.1st and most important of all is; this is a survival game. Meaning hard difficulty and permanent death. Even though, you can customize the world to your liking and survive with your conditions. The default version being the intended difficulty.2nd is the gameplay. You can move with clicking your mouse, just like in any Diablo-esque games. You can move with ASDW (which I prefer and recommend). It's simple to play and is very responsive. The game is simple in graphics and has really good animations (meaning anyone can play it!). The music and sounds are awesome but they might become repetitive at some point (at which you just turn them off :D). This may be one downside that bothered me a bit, but it is not a big problem at all.3rd is the game itself, you are placed inside a world where you are only told that you should look for something to eat. Don't starve is not nearly the only danger you should look out for. You have to stay warm in the Winter, stay cool in the Summer, protect your things, avoid monsters, kill monsters, survive giants, maintain sanity. But more importantly, you build structures, walls, farms, protective structures, traps, weapons, tools. Furthermore, you explore secrets, caves, biomes, animals, monsters, items! There are so many options in this game to explore. I have 40-ish hours on this game (for now) and I have only explored barely half of all the things that can be done. I haven't even customized the starting world yet! I've been playing default untill I got the hang of it. But the number of settings and customizations you can make to your world are nearly endless! You can also unlock other characters which all have different perks and abillities.4th and last are the community mods that can expand and improve your game greatly (I'm using 8 mods at the moment). Not to mention the upcoming multiplayer that will allow you and your friends to experience this survival game in a world that has your rules and settings.I highly recommend this game to anyone that likes: survival / fighting / building and crafting stuff.Best regards, Devon."

You better find something to eat before night comes!"" Those are words to live by. I haven’t actually finished the story myself, I’m still working on that, (I prefer to just explore and try to live as long as I can). I would recommend the trailer[s] to anyone who would like to know more about the story.Some things just aren’t able to be put into words, and the trailer with the conversation between Wilson and Maxwell is just summed up best by watching the trailer.http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=396885705Game Play:The controls are quite straight forward, you can control how your character moves with ASDW, or by clicking on the ground/objects, or click and holding down the mouse button. Your inventory is very limited, but I can’t complain about that, it simply requires you to make backpacks/chests/etc.There are three “resources” to juggle in don’t starve: Sanity, Hunger, Health. As the game itself implies, don’t let yourself be hungry for too long, once your hunger drops to zero, your health drains very fast until you die. Once your health is gone, you’re dead. Sanity is an interesting resource, but I’ll let you find out why for yourself if you get the game.http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=398924705Price:Don’t starve costs $14.99 (as of July 25, 2014) and the DLC “Reign of Giants “is $4.99. Apparently this summer there’s supposed to be an expansion to allow the game to become multiplayer, I’m looking forward to playing with friends on this great survival game.Thankfully for those who already own the game and the DLC, you don’t need to worry about buying anything else, but for those that don’t own the game; the price will be increased to $19.99. I’ve put 52 hours into the game so far, I have no doubt I will go back to playing more of this game, so regardless of when you get the game I feel the price is very fair.Conclusion:I used to say that if I had to own only one game, It would come down to a three way tie between ""Minecraft"", ""Terraria"", and ""Don't Starve"". All three are excellent games, and all three have different play styles, Don't Starve is probably the most unique.http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=395630283------Edits and updates------Edit/Update January 13, 2015:Here's the URL to see my review forDon't Starve TogetherEdit/Update September 18, 2015:Added screenshots to the review.Here's the URL to see my review forDon't Starve Reign of Giants DLCEdit/Update February 29, 2016:Added YouTube Video Review Link!"

,Recommended,219740,20861618,"Posted: 30 January, 2016",all,"just sauce, raw sauce","Don't Starve is an absolutely awesome survival game with a mesmorizing soundtrack and genuine dark, mysterious -- and sometimes satirical aura surrounding it.You start off with no weapons, no protection from the elements (aside from the preset clothing the character of your choice is given, which I will get more into later), and most of all, little knowledge as to where in theheckyou are -- or how you got there (unless you watched some of the trailers.)You are spoken down to by this mysterious and dapper being sporting a traditional suit 'n tie, very reminiscent of the ""G-Man"" from the Half-Life series, he addresses you with a few words, and then poofs into nonexistance -- though you'll meet up with him in the near future.Don't Starve may SEEM like an absolutely pointless survival game with an infinite number of days, and that the clock won't stop ticking until you die (permadeath is a real thing, and you can't come back unless you've crafted yourself an effigy!) but fret not, there's more to this game than meets the eye!After what might be hours and hours of grinding, you'll find yourself coming across a variety of different scenarios - what looks like towns inhabited by xenophobic pig-men, stone ruins patrolled by mechanical 'robots', and much more. You'll find mysterious objects like ""Box Thing"", ""Ring Thing"", and they might just be miscellaneous objects you can just throw around and never pay any further mind to.. or they might be the key to 'beating' the game.My experience with the game has been absolutely splendid, I've encountered moments when I've been absolutely mobbed by armed pig-men, nearly scared to death by what looks like extraordinarily large turkies which pop out of bushes, and nerve-racking moments when my characters sanity begins to deterioate, causing haunting figures to appear..But lets break it down, shall we?PROS -A Survival Game:But a more well-designed and optimized one, constantly managed and won't be forsaken like what happens to most survivals.. (looking at you, DayZ)A Neat-o Crafting System:Items can be either very simplistic or slightly trivial to create, starting off is quite easy - mere flint and twigs and you have yourself either a Pickaxe, Shovel, or Chopping Axe, and can now chop down all them trees! (""Take that, Nature!"" -- Wilson)Insanely Vague Story:This can go both ways; some people enjoy a story that's fleshed out, has alot of dialogue, and is clearly presented to you, but not this game - the game itself doesn't provide the player much information to work off of, conclusions will have to be made on your own end, and there are plenty of wiki's that'll help you further understand the game.Wild Encounters:There are alot of things to see in this game, from the occasional mysterious item surrounded by 'Evil Flowers' that'll drain your character's sanity to wormholes that'll consume you whole and transport you to a different part of the map. (Wormhole transport systems are great, yo.) Not to mention the shifting of seasons, an abundance of sinkholes leading to caves, and with the addition of DLCs, you could be taking down colossal giants or sailing the seas. You could also purchase""Don't Starve Together""(free if you've already bought the base game prior to the DLC's release) and try and survive with friends, or random people on the interwebs!A Variety Of Characters:Wilson is the preset character, and has no other special abilities other than the ability to grow the most manliest of beards (I mean, what more do you need than that, right?) but there are also little old ladies, muscular men afraid of the dark, and even a little pyromaniac girl and her dead sister at your disposal. All with their own unique abilities.CONS -Tedious Gameplay:There are people who have yet to beat the game despite having weeks logged into it, YouTubers still at the first stage whilst on Day 300, so on and so forth. So if you can't handle devotion or have commitment issues.. might wanna steer away from this game a bit.Rage Factor:The rage factor in this game depends on your progress, really. I wouldn't give two ♥♥♥♥♥ if I was brutally slaughtered by a spider on my first day.. but if you're the kind of person that has over 50 days, collected the items that'll help you progress through the game's ""story"" and are mistakenly killed by one of those♥♥♥♥♥♥headed frogs, well.. I'll set up a prayer circle to mend your broken heart and sanity.Game Length:This goes along with 'Tedious Gameplay', but just take a gander at the people who've actually 'beaten' the game and the hours THEY have. Or just go on YouTube and see for yourself.TL;DR - An absolutely phenomenial game, the music makes it all better. Don't buy it if you can't handle the whole survival concept, permadeath, and sheer overall length of the game.Graphics/Art: 4.5 out of 5Gameplay: 5 out of 5Story/Lore: 2.5 out of 5 (if not researched) 4 out of 5 (if researched)Overall Grade: 4 out of 5"

76561198110841864,Recommended,219740,10055601,"Posted: 8 May, 2014",all,always,"This game's art style is really what caught my eye in the first place, so I thought I would buy it whenever it went on sale.Basically this is a game of survival and there are many things that can kill you. Your character is thrown into a world of vast wilderness and left to fend for himself/herself. Each world is randomly arranged and have random spawnings, keeping the game pretty fresh and new. You gather natural materials like sticks and rocks, make tools like axes and shovels, make traps or weapons to catch animals for food, set up campfires for survival, etc.In the game you have three things you want to keep in check when surviving: Health, Hunger, and Sanity. If you lose your health, well, you can die. If you lose your hunger, you lose your health and die. If you lose your sanity, you start seeing things. Eventually your hallucinations become violent when you're insane and can hurt you. You can also unlock different and unique characters depending on in-game events or accomplishments.The art style of this game in my opinion, is very unique and eye-catching. The game is very smooth and doesn't lag alot in general. (depending on how your computer is running though.) It does crash sometimes though. (I've had it crash twice on me.) I have also found a few glitches in the game (before Reign of Giants.)This game gives you alot of chores for survival to keep you occupied, though sometimes it does get repeative. The worlds in Maxwell's Gate are the true challenges, whether its going through endless winters or rain. Or even hunted by hounds. Every world is filled with multiple monsters and critters to kill or survive from. There are also tons of material to collect for tons of creations you can unlock and survive with, giving this game some variety if you get that far. I really love the different characters in this game too, each one having their own charms and personalities. (My favorite character is Webber.) At times I get alot of creepy vibes from this game, especially at night when my sanity is getting low. And accomplished vibes whenever I survive from stuff.This game does have its charms, but it also has its fair share of flaws. Some of the flaws with this game is the repetiveness when trying to survive multiple times. Dying is definitely a big disappointment, especially when you get pretty far. This was not meant to be a very easy game though. The farther you get, the harder it gets. I would also say that some of the music (mostly in reign of giants) is a little too...cheesy, in a way? (I suppose its meant to be like that but still,) And some of the character's voices (which are instrument sounds) get a little annoying at times. Like Wilson's, for example, and when he gets hurt. The things they say give them alot of personality though. Especially Wendy. One more thing, sometimes (especially when you're a newbie) you encounter things that you have no idea how to deal with unless you look it up. (Which I suggest doing research before eating any of those colorful mushrooms unless you want to do it yourself.)One last thing I have to say about this game is this: It's not for everyone. Some people (like me) will really like this game, and others might think its as boring as heck, everyone has their own tastes. So, if you're interested in it, I suggest checking this game out and maybe watch other people play it. Its a very fun game and can get time-consuming, I'd say its worth a buy. 8/10.Another thing: Multiplayer is comming soon! :D"

This is by far the most addicting game I have ever played, and its stood strong for three years since its release back in 2013, and given that I have managed to survive for over 250 days in a world I generated two months ago, I felt it proper to give my overall thoughts on the game in general. I still recommend it for someone looking for a challenge, and anybody interested in this should definately give it a try, since it does offer a lot that other survival games do not have. On top of managing hunger, you need to manage sanity loss and health as well, making for a challenging experience. With Reign of Giants and Shipwrecked DLC, you can further expand your worlds with new challenges and items to craft. With an endless until you die Sandbox mode, and a portal to an Adventure Mode that offers six harder more challenging worlds, the replayabillity is near endless, with each world generating a completely different world layout every time.Also, if you end up liking this and would like to play it with friends or strangers, I'd suggest to take a look at Don't Starve Together, the standalone multiplayer version of Don't Starve, complete with all new content and the Reign of Giants expansion content already included with the game."

,Recommended,219740,11423418,"Posted: 26 July, 2014",all,Blue Award,":dsham:Isometric view survival game with quite unique, memorable art style.As you may imagine from the title, focus here is on non-combat survival - fighting hunger and adverse environmental conditions like weather or darkness at night. Granted, monsters are out there to get you as well.The game is rather open ended, no clear goals other than survival, although there's an adventure mode to find, which is a more focused challenge.You're definitely meant to discover things yourself on the go, through many deaths of you, forging mad in-game survival skills in fires of hell. If you're looking through guides, wikias, videos... you are somewhat missing the point and missing out great deal on the intended ""fun"".And good riddance, as far as I am concerned, and wikia contributors be praised. Otherwise game is very unfair, puts constant pressure on you, demands great deal from you yet explains nothing, all the while throwing curve balls at you from all possible directions simultaneously and just waiting for any suitable moment to sucker punch you with extreme prejudice. And on top of that this is perma death. You screw up royally, you're out of luck, and have to start from zero on a new random world (but hopefully with more experience now to do better; also I should say there's a way to secure resurrection, but not like it's fool proof, so the royal screw up is always an option).Seriously, eff that noise. I'm pretty sure die hard fans who went through this without any external help are suffering from Stockholm syndrome.As you may see I'm not entirely a fan of the frantic gameplay and main design decisions in general, but I cannot claim the game is bad. What it wants to do, it does very well, and it's an interesting experience to get out of your comfort zone, change the pace a little. Although I did get me some external help on how to survive in this hell, missing a lot of the intended ""fun"", I had some quality time nonetheless to appreciate this title and I don't regret it.It's not really that hard to set up some nice sustainable camp and a variety of defenses from weekly wake up call, you can even set up reasonable supplies despite your main focus here - food - being perishable... It's just that at some point this becomes a chore that prevents you from doing the real good parts. At least IMHOI had way more actual fun with, say, Terraria, which has quite a different focus - on combat and exploration, with ample addition of creative projects you can undertake, where gathering up resources is a means to an end not your primary worry. I guess I like to mess around in games, especially such that promise sandbox experience, at my own pace, rather than being constantly rushed and pushed and with perma death looming on the horizon to make me lose my entire progress. For the latter, I'd rather play some rogue-lites with well balanced pacing.You may probably get bit philosophical about this and claim this game gets it real... Too real for my taste, I guess. Where's my goddarned escapism, eh?Oh, a final thought, though - the above mostly concerns default settings, but actually the game is extremely configurable so once you do get the taste of the intended default experience, you can tweak practically every aspect of the game a lot to match your tastes and perhaps make it easier or even more difficult. Workshop support also something to consider, and official DLC that adds two more seasons, overheating on top of freezing and some other elements, is also something to mix things up. So despite my whining above you can really get a lot from this title, so give it a shot if you have a chance.:dsham:"

You will also have weather and heat and cold to contend with on top of the fact that nearly everything will try and kill you in one way or another.Caves add another layer of challange to the game with multiple levels of darkness and monsters to explore.

Besides having a very interesting art style and a great sense of humor, there is a large amount of things to craft and the resource gathering sates the kleptomaniac in me. All those grass and twigs you spent the past 30 min picking up? Yea you're going to need them. Unlike games such as Fallout where you can kind of just pick up things you want and avoid small drops, you're going to want to get everything you can. Nothing you find in the game is worthless, every drop and resource has a purpose which is a nice touch. There is an extensive wiki on this game, so if you need to know the use of a certain item or a crock pot recipe it's all available to you.I have to say a few things. One is that if you're dumb like me and didn't know that charcoal is burnt wood, let that be an indication of how to get it (Crock Pot is one of the most important items to survive well past winter). Two is that you might want to get the mod that shows your status (in numerical value) and shows the value for food. It may make the game less frustrating while not taking away from it. Third is that this is a game with perma-death (although there are multiple ways to revive yourself) and dying is the only way to earn experience to unlock most of the characters.Either way as you can tell I've sunk a large chunk of my time into this game and I highly recommend it."

76561198063340412,Recommended,219740,10498303,"Posted: 16 June, 2014",all,Rook,"Don't Starve is an indie game about...not starving. Or getting killed by spiders. Or werepigs. Or stupid, randomly spawning dogs...or, well, there's a lot of ways to die in this game besides just starving, and I'll leave it at that. Overall, it's a rewarding, if not incredibly challenging, experience.Usually, indie games are highlighted by either their story, design or gameplay, which may prove significantly more innovative or intriguing than your average AAA game. That's why we buy them. Don't Starve is...a little bit different, to say the least, in that it's not all that inspiring in terms of story or gameplay. Here's the story: you don't want to starve, and also there's this dapper looking gentleman who appears to be channeling the ghost of a douchy harmonium. In terms of gameplay, point-and-click or use WASD to move around and interact with your environment, etc, etc. It's nothing that special.BUT! The design and presentation of the game make up for this apparent lack and reveal that the game itself is not nearly as lacking as it may seem to the wandering eyes of you potential buyers. In terms of design, its quirky, dark, funny and heavily Tim Burton-ized. The art style is simple enough that it doesn't overstep the abilities of its indie designers but still appears fresh, pretty and new, and each character you unlock through surviving longer and longer is unique, with his or her own set of perks and weaknesses that can be amusing, annoying or just plain scary. There's a girl who's dead twin literally follows her around, or a lumberjack with a possessed axe and a dark, beaver-based secret. Personally, I hope for more characters to be added to the vanilla game or perhaps as DLC because the current roster gets unlocked pretty quickly on an good three or four runs through the game. Still, these characters are more interesting than what you'll pick up from most games at this price.And when you do delve deep into this game after many, many, many trial runs, you'll discover that there's actually a lot of lore and story to this world. This mostly begins after entering Adventure Mode (and if you die in this mode, it doesn't affect your progress in the sandbox world), which can be done by opening a door randomly generated in any of your played worlds. You progress through five unique and challenging worlds, and along the way, you get a chance to see some of this lore and will probably hunger for more. Don't Starve leaves a lot more questions unanswered than I would like, but it's all to the cruelly addicting benefit of the game itself.Finally, I should address the difficulty of this game. You probably won't make it past the first five or so days on your first try without customizing the world. It's not an easy game, lacks any form of tutorial at all and all enemies, from bosses to weak spiders, can be found in the overworld on Day 1. Yes, there are one-time respawn points if you find them, but if you die, then it's over. Sometimes those respawn points don't even spawn. Your forty days of surviving through the turmoil of winter? Screw it! Never happened! And that does kind of suck, but it all adds to the tension and atmosphere of the game itself. You don't get a tutorial in the goddamn woods! No one saves you when you decide to attack a herd of water buffalo with a stick of meat! And that mushroom over there? What does it do? Oh wait, it drains all of your sanity and makes shadow creatures in your head eat off your face. That'll learn ya.So yes, Don't Starve is difficult, especially during the winter months. But this is a survival game about surviving in a magical survival forest full of pop culture references and musical instruments. It's not supposed to be easy. And I'll tell you, there's nothing more rewarding than making it past your longest survival time. And if it's too hard, then you can tweak the spawning in a customized world so that only friendly bunnies and happy flowers populate your world. And occasionally, Satanic trees possessed with the vengeance of a thousand sundered splinters will pop up and absolutely wreck everything you hold dear and precious, as was intended by the Founding Fathers."

I did not expect the mechanics and setting to be so immersive but they stand up strong next to any ""3D"" games that can be found in this genre. When night falls I feel a genuine sense of peril and urgency to get back to my camp or risk death by any one of a variety of night-time creepies. Thats hard to pull of in a cartoony 2D game. Im not a huge horror fan, but this game has juuuuuuuust the right amount of suspense to make it exciting but not nerve-wrackingly scary. On that point - the graphics are fantastic for what they are meant to be, a dark comedic romp through a 2D survival sim that seems to be something out of a Tim Burton movie. My only small issue is the controller option is a tiny bit hard to use for construction on your site. Its hard to get things in the right spot to place, making it frustrating when building your shelter. Otherwise fantastic so far :) 9/10"

Now at that time I had no clue on how to mod videogames, and was too lazy to do so. Until a couple of months ago I had tons of free time, and decided to give modding a try. After yet another friend brought this game I was reminded of this game. So since I've been modding 3D games such as Left4Dead2, I decided what the heck, I'll buy this game and give the modding at try.After playing a none-custom game, I died the first day from not getting up a fire up in time. This made me want to try again, this time I survivaled 3 days, dying by going insane from not knowing how to keep sane. But with each new game I learned how things worked and what creatures are friendly and need to be avioded. After playing it a few hours I have found that this game is INCREDIBLY addicting.The world randomly generates so every play through is a new experience, keeping each game feeling fresh. You never know when you'll spawn in the middle of nowhere, in a rich in resources pig village, or right next to a spider nest or pack of blood thirsty hounds. Not only that, since I do own Reign of Giants dlc you must watch out for the seasons, if you customize your world settings to be more advanced you may be a unlucky person to spawn in summer or winter, where you can easily overheat or freeze to death. The game is unforgiving, it tries it's hardest to kill you but with each gameplay you learn to survive longer.The game has a very unique-looking style. It reminds me a little of a Tim Buton-like style, and it's very nice to look at. The creatures are creative too, along with each character you can unlock with their different abilities.I then tried my hand at modding the game and found that it is VERY easy to mod. Now I do have more experience modding harder games so those without modding experience might take a little longer to learn than someone will some experience, but since the games community and the games staff is generous and very willing to help you with modding it. You'll defiantly get the hang of it eventually. There are also plenty of videos to help you out with it.I defiantly reccommend buying this game, it is worth every penny.

The game is largely undirected; you're literally dropped in a field and told, fittingly, not to starve to death. After that you gather resources, craft items, and try to find a way out of the strange world you inhabit.There's a lot of game to explore. Each successive world is randomly generated and all are thus challenging in different ways. Nothing is ever explained; you learn by doing and exploring. Sadly, the various characters you unlock change things minorly at best, and the core gameplay never really changes: collect things, craft things, try not to die or go insane (and, with the new expansion, try not to freeze or overheat).Don't Starvegood game, but not one I liked. I found the resource management tedious, and although the exploration and investigative elements were compelling, the constant ticking clock of starvation and insanity and freezing and overheating was too oppressive for me to enjoy myself."

It's the name of the game, I'm just that great of a player.Don't Starve is a nice little Indie game, I like it and I reccomend others to try it as well. At first I thought I wouldn't like it because I thought it just had the same concept as any other survival game, you get materials, don't die, and build stuff. I actually compared it to Minecraft. That was a mistake. This is obviously nothing like Minecraft, and it even isn't as generic as most other surivial based games.When I first started playing I fell in love with the game. It was fun learning how to do everything, exploring the world, and trying not to starve. The art style is nice and unique and gameplay aint half bad, I personally use the keyboard and the mouse, but it can be played completely with your mouse if you want to and it had controller support as well.Most people will probably skip the single player game and get Don't Starve Together but I suggest getting Don't Starve as well. It can prepare you for playing co-op in Together as you learn the ins and outs of everything, that and the fact they are two completely diffrent games in terms of conent.Don't Starve Together only has the base game and some asepcts of the Reign of Giants DLC, along with some Don't Starve Together exclusive conent. The base game however has 2 DLCs thus far, Shipwrecked completely changing the game as if it was a full conversion mod, and also the base game has Adventure Mode, in which you put your skills to the test to surivie the world and solve the puzzles to finish the game.This game is endless hours of fun and it's quite easy to get started and find yourself doing good. The only downside is that when you do die (for good) You loose your world and everything and you have to start over, I personally don't like perminant death but I've gotten used to it in Don't Starve because sometimes you get even better world spawns and finds then you did on your previous run.Also the lore now is a little bit outdate as the lore in Don't Starve Together is the canon lore, and you can't dress up with skins in the base game. Some monsters are really hard to fight, so if you look to actually move up from fighting spiders and beefalo, you will find a challange in fighting them, that's really the only time the game gets hard other then that it's pretty relaxing.The small downsides apart, the game is great and worth your time to play. Great time killer. Also mods can make your life easier if you do struggle with the harder monsters like I do. (who thought hounds were a good idea?)"

,Recommended,219740,34374464,Posted: 20 August,all,FuryElise,"Don't starve is a survival game that is often compared to Terraria or Minecraft. It is definitely not like either of those. Of course, they all have in common the factor of survival, but Don't Starve is much harder to beat and it has more mechanics. For instance, there is a weather mechanic that works differently from Minecraft. The rain mechanic causes the player to get wet, filling up a soak bar, which ultimately causes the player to be cold faster. The items in your inventory are also affected by how wet you are. The cold mechanic causes the player to lose sanity and health, so one must adjust one's in-game outfit according to the weather/season. A hot weather mechanic causes the player to burn, making them lose health, and so on.Another cool feature to the game is that you cannot stay without a light during the night. If you do, a shadow monster will kill you, causing a game over. Sanity is also an important feature in Don't Starve (alongside health and hunger), and the player loses sanity when fighting monsters, coming in contact with shadows who try to extinguish your fire at night and so on. There are also several ways in which one can regain sanity, and the game is generally balanced in terms of that.The more and longer you play, you get more experience, which helps you unlock new characters with new features. All characters have their own personality and own look, but most importantly, they have different weaknesses and strenghts. One character comes with a lighter, and setting things on fire will help her regain sanity. However, if this charcter is low on sanity, she will set things around her on fire by accident, sometimes causing valuable things such as a science machine to be set on fire and burn. This makes the game more interesting to play, because it gives the player more choice and more posibilities to explore, however it also comes with consequences.The game is fun to play if you wish to relax, but also if you want to play something challenging, as the world is customisable, and you can adjust the world to your liking. If you want no monsters and only good things, you can have that, but you can also make the monsters very likely to spawn and there is even a ""night only"" mode.Don't Starve is a game worth playing, and the DLCs enforce that. If you're bored of the normal mode, you can play Don't Starve: Shipwrecked or Don't Starve: A reign of gigants, which offer twists to the normal game and there are even more possibilities to explore the game and try your hardest to survive! Therefore, my rating for this game is 10/10."

The art direction of this series has always intrigued me, I just wasn't sure if it was something I could get in to.The game went on Sale this week, so I picked it up.  It's safe to say, 'the rest is history'.What an amazing little survival game!

The sounds, music, mechanics, map design, 'critter' art and designs, all of it are just superb, and unique.The game runs flawlessly, without any hiccups, so far.  The modding community for this game is alive and well, ensuring that this series won't be going away anytime soon.I highly recommend this game to ANY kind of gamer, it will surprise you!

Developed & published by Klei Entertainment. The gameplay is simple which is pretty common for Klei, the controls are nothing special which isn’t bad, the gameplay itself is mostly fun although I have some personal gripes with combat.But, first, let’s talk about the graphics, the game is an isometric 2.5D game, with this really intriguing dark pencil drawn art style, the fact that the world of Don’t Starve itself is this mysterious & weird world also lends itself to this type of art style. The music also reminds me of this sort of twisted carnival feel, with lots of weird strings & brass instruments used to set the tone, characters also speak with mashed up music tones from different instruments, sounding mostly unpleasant.So as it’s about survival, you’ll brave all the elements of the seasons, the ever present drain on your sanity & your belly grumbling. Don’t Starve also features plenty of dangerous creatures as well as some neutral ones ranging from the Pigmen to the aggressive fish like Merms & of course with the Reign of Giants DLC, Giant boss monsters like the Deerclops. It’s a pretty challenging game, don’t expect to survive very long with your first forays into Don’t Starve, you’ll die plenty of times but, never unfairly so, as you learn the game you will become a better survivor & the game rewards you for how long you survive by unlock more characters to play with a total of eleven to choose from all with their own strengths & weaknesses. The story of Don’t Starve is only accessible through the sandbox mode which you start in, if you wish to know how to get there, you’ll have to experiment to find out.My only real gripe is with the games ‘combat’, you interact with the world mainly with the mouse, you can hold the spacebar to pick up nearby objects which is really handy, you can use the mouse or keyboard to move around, but, when in combat, I only ever was able to use the mouse, this is a problem, since the world is flat it is very easy & common for things to get in the way. This is only exasperated when things are hectic, it’s very annoying when there is multiple enemies. There are several ways to avoid combat, but, when you must it’s a pain dealing with multiple enemies at once. Other than that gripe the game is just pure fun, the multiplayer part was so simple to setup I can’t find anything to complain about, it’s the whole single player game with friends up to six & it’s easy to use plus you get two copies for the one price so it’s pretty cheap.I personally love Don’t Starve, it was a bit to get into at first, mostly because I was failing a lot at the beginning, but, once I gave it a serious shot I began to get better & better & could survive a very long time before dying, if you like survival type games in general definitely check this out, if you don’t like a challenge, or don’t like indies (for some reason) or just don’t like things that aren’t 3D ultra-graphics & “realistic” then steer clear of the quirky world of Don’t Starve, for the rest, we’ll be trying to survive despite the odds. Its $14.99 USD which is a pretty good deal, I’d recommend getting the bundle with the Reign of Giants for $18.99 USD which will give you a ton of stuff, or get the bundle that comes with a copy of Don’t Starve Together which includes the Reign of Giants DLC & bring a friend along for the ride! Thank you Klei Entertainment for awesome deals on awesome games!TL/DR; Don’t Starve is a wonderful survival game that doesn’t take itself too seriously but does offer a serious challenge for new comers. It’s got a very unique art style. The game is simple to play & simple to run with the sandbox goal of ‘survive’, it holds no hands & still expects you to succeed, it’s a fun game, & its multiplayer component Don’t Starve Together makes the experience even better with the ability to bring friends along for the suffering. I highly recommend check out both titles, they offer good deals for the single & multiplayer experience, unless you can’t stand the look of the game, or need that “realistic” approach to survival then check out Don’t Starve & Don’t Starve Together!-Double Thumbs Up from Royial"

Inclusing the DLC too, this game is a bundle of amazingness. Don't starve is , if not, on it's way to becoming the best gaming experience around. The fact you get dropped into a completely random world full of so many things that can kill you is so much fun. Of course the main objective is to not starve, but there are so many other obstacles to overcome, and so many ways to do just that. Don't starve is an amazing game that has taken up around 100 hours of my time, and soon to be much, much more. It will soon be multiplayer, so being able to experience all the dangers, problems and sucesses but with some company is something to look forward to.If you do not have patience, then this game probably isn't the best idea. You start off with mainly grass and wood, but as the game flows on, you can be speeding around with a cane, a top hat and some turkey dinner! What could be better?This game just offers such a thrill. The fact it also has great replayability, with other characters and that you can edit your worlds however you like, making it more difficult or easy, or even install some mods made by the fabulous people in the Steam Don't Starve workshop!Overall, if you have some spare time, a bit of money and are looking for a good, fun game, then I definately recommend this one."

However, that's easier said than done, and this game has quite a bit of content to make it an enjoyable game with plenty of replay value. At the start of the game, you can choose from a group of characters to play as. You will start with only one option, but unlock more as you play through the game. Most are unlocked through experience points that are gained after dying, with a few hidden through various other methods.After choosing your character, you wake up in the wilderness, and are forced to find materials to help yourself survive. There are other living things in this game, ranging from ordinary animals to strange beasts such as pig-men or walking trees, and a lot will try to kill you. You will need to keep yourself from starving by making use of food found throughout the world, keep your sanity high so you don't begin to hallucinate, and keep close to light at night so the shadow beasts won't kill you.Traversing the large area you play in is a lot of fun, and hunting for materials can feel very rewarding when you finally find that last gold nugget you needed for a science machine. You'll need to plan very carefully, as a mistake can lead to death. The game gets addicting very quickly, and each death will only build your knowledge of the world until you can finally get the lucky attempt where you survive past winter. The sense of progression is fantastic, as you can easily see how much your hard work has paid off. The game is in a very nice art style that suits it very well, and the sound effects really add to the atmosphere the game has.Pros:+Fun and pleasant visuals+Excellent use of sounds+Variety of different characters makes each game interesting+Wide cast of allies and enemies you will meet+Addicting gameplay that allows the player to learn as they play more+DLC that's really worth the price+Steam workshop mods really add to the overall experienceCons:-The game is very confusing at first, and doesn't really offer any sort of tutorial. This isn't too much of a problem, but can make the game really confusing for some playersIf I had to give the game a score, it would be a 9/10. The lack of direction at the very start is the only potential issue I can think of, and even that isn't much of a problem for most people, myself included. I highly recommend this game, especially now that Don't Starve Together is in beta!"

It has two modes; a sandbox survival mode in which your goal is simply to explore and become self-sustaining, and an adventure mode in which your goal is to overcome harsh environments to complete a machine to move to the next world.  You can play either in the spirit of discovering how to construct, create, and build everything yourself or consult and external reference for help, but either way, you'll be presented with a challenge that will keep you occupied and wanting to go a little further for weeks.

If you die without finding what looks to look like a coffin usually surrounded by stakes with pig heads on them, its perma death for you!!!!

It is great that there are diffrent characters, and that they all are diffrent. The style and art of the game is really cool it makes the game dark and a bit spooky.

The best part of this game is not knowing anything about it. Running up to an animal and poking it only to have it two shot you. While you might think like a typical surival game you'll eventually get a cozy farm and endless meat and resources... Suriving is only half the battle. If you want to advance the story and actually get everything out of the game you'll need advanced items, food enough to last you a while away from base and luck in finding what you're looking for. This game has so many layers and so many ways you can play it!There is so much replay value to this game as it is rogue like and your world will be destroyed if you die and your file deleted. While there are one or two methods of gaining... basically an extra life... they're far and few between so just be prepared for lots of deaths at first. You unlock new characters as you progress and survive more and more days so each time you get different buffs ande debuffs making each experience unique and with its own challanges. Overall and amazing game with a ton of depth that is so much more than your average survival game.A huge thing is multiplayer coming out for this game.

The survival gameplay is also fun, sometimes uncertain thing will happen to you when you're exploring the area or found the maxwell door (which is very hard for first timer). Aside from the gameplay, the script used for interaction also humorous. The game is not exactly so serious, when you died you will received exp to unlocking another character.

Some people even fear the game a bit because the graphics are unsettling to them which I personally just think would only add to the experience of being in a new, hostile world.There are tons of mods for the game if you'd ever get bored of it, a large variety of characters and hours of playtime.The game at first seems real frustrating but in a way that you'd want to give it another shot and avoid what killed you.Also the amount of pets and styles of pets are pretty fun. I personally love Chester most, a treasure chest looking dog creature that follows you around and lets you store things in his mouth.Whenever you seem that the world has dried out and you are sure to die unless you find something that will rejuvinate everyting, it is time to head into the caves. But you risk your life to the new enemies that await you there.It's not ONLY survival as far as you can go, there is for example the Adventure Mode.The different mechanics to the characters and different stats for them make it seem like you're playing another game since you'll have to play the game a completely different way if you're to gain an advantage, so when you've unlocked everything you still might not know what character it is you want to use. None is better than the rest.If you are looking for a realistic game, then this is probably not for you.If you're looking for a game to spend quite a lot of time in and see new types of enemies and like games that look pretty (Perhaps such as Sworcery and Bastion) then this is something you should give a shot."

But this game stands out amoung all these survival games as being different. Different for the art style, for the music, for the gameplay, for everything about it, even down to the lack of 'hand-holding' and tutorials.This game's art stlye is unlike most games, it it a very beautiful, hand-drawn style, with a ghothic theme. With even the water having this theme to it. The characters are done in this style and not only being very apealing to the eye, but also have very interesting personalites, different dialogue, and traits that may either help them to survive or even hinder their survival. This means that although you might become a professional at surviving with one character, you will fail with another.The music of this game is fantasitc, as whatever the characters say is not accompained by a voice, but by an instrument, and different tunes for different characters. This is rarely used in video games, and is one of the many things that makes Don't Starve unique. Their instrument (or lack there of) normally goes really well with their appearence and personality, having loud music for strong characters, and having quiet music for shy characters, etc.This game is overall a learning experience, through playing it, many things will be happening to you, many new things that you must investigate, learn if it's harmful or not, learn if eating that mushroom will hurt your health, or if that creature is going to kill you or follow you. And no matter how good you will get at this game, and how much you learn, you will always find new things and die from something stupid. I would recommend this game to anyone who wants a challenge and is ready to try over and over again to get it right."

The jist of the game is survival. Your character is put in a world with nothing and told to either make a life for yourself (gather logs, stones to make stuff) or die.The quirky jokes and unique characters are awesome. I love how they all have their own little sayings when it comes to examining objects in the game. . . and these sayings will definitely make you smile.I also love the custom aspect of things (and I'm not just talking about the mods). If you wanna get a feel for the game you can tweak settings and make it easier for yourself (GUILTY) or you can give yourself a bit of a challenge by making it always winter and full of nasty creatures.

There's good enemy variety and lots of things to discover, and you have a good amount of customization for the world before you spawn in it.  Everything from frequency of the various enemy/food spawns, to how the seasons work.The game also comes with a Caves update (probably big enough to be a DLC) that adds an entire new biome, enemies and more, and also a mod that adds an entire other little game called The Screecher.  The DLC Reign of Giants is also worth getting, it adds quite a bit of content for it's price.  Over all, a great game."

Like many sandbox games, this one allows you to make your own goals, but unlike said genre, these goals might be impeded by the world's terrain and weather (and even your own sanity). The world's unforgiving nature forces you to manage your needs before you can handle your wants (which can get very frustrating at times), but is very rewarding once one can manage the game's mechanics. Don't Starve knows how to handle the risk-and-reward mechanic, which is one way the game can get you out of your comfort zone. Hunting tough enemies like Mactusk and Co. and treeguards can reward you with useful items, like the walking cane (for the impatient ones) and living logs (for the magicians). It is a rogue-like, so those who don't like starting over should be extra cautious about their actions. All in all, Don't Starve is not a game for everyone, but it's well worth the purchase for strategists and survival enthusiasts."

Simply click on things, find out what they do, combine them with other things, and LEARN.  This game is brilliant in its simplicity and depth.  With each death, you learn a little bit more about how to survive for longer.  My only complaint is that once you figure out how to survive, the game can stagnate and become rather dull.  Sure, you can make up your own endgame goals, but I wish there was better endgame content."

It has a superb 'Klei Trademarked' art style, loveable, and hilarious characters with great backstories and abilities, and many rewarding, punishing enemies and plants, (and somtimes both)Whereas many other games focus more on thriving rather than surviving (by that I mean, build an epic base, get really cool gear and live happily ever after - Minecraft? Terraria?), this game instead only rewards surviving, and surviving alone.While this does narrow down the fun your can have in making your base personal and getting different armour and weapons to your friends, it does bring about a new sense of satisfaction at making it through the night with barely enough food, or finding a flower garden when the hairy♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥come out (more on that later), and it encourages you to try again when you fail, perhaps as a different character to last time, giving a lot of potential replayability.As any of the various characters in the game, you have three different things you need to keep on top of - your hunger, your health and your sanity. Seems pretty generic at first, but don't ignore these, as they will determine just where you go wrong in your game; you might think your on top of your food supply, but find yourself starving the next day.There are a number of different ways to replenish each of these stats. Hunger and sanity naturally go down by themselves, having an empty hunger bar causes you to loose health. Running out of sanity causes you to hallucinate - creating hairy shadow-like monsters that attack you (such as the hairy♥♥♥♥♥♥♥) Creating a base involves setting up various bits and bobs round a campfire, maybe making some walls around it and calling it home.The enemies are rewarding when killed but can sometimes not be worth the challenge, due to the high risk of death, so be warned.Reign of Giants, the expansion, adds even more content to this game as well, so be sure to get it with the game.Overall, tons to do in this game, even more with RoG. if you can make it past the first few nights. Even harder during summer or winter with extreme temperatures making it impossible to move without dying.Another fantastic game by Klei Entertainment8.5/10"

The game is very well made. slightly addicting, and a lot of fun to play. As you would assume, it's survival. The game consists of: preventing starvation, attemping to adapt and evolve science, and completing the story goal and trying to understand the backstory of the game, which in my opinion is quite interesting. It's slightly resemblant to Minecraft, of course removing the concept of total world destruction. Worlds are randomly generated and magnificent.

It also includes a second game mode that is worth checking out that plays kind of like the ""Slenderman"" horror minigame.  It is challenging, at least in the beginning while you are trying to figure out how not to starve to death or get murdered by darkness.  The second character you unlock basically allows you to play endlessly, so if you want a good challenge, try skipping her.  Also, the game seems to ramp up difficulty the more days you survive, which I know sounds typical, but the game lends itself to a feeling of opening new areas for higher difficulty instead of time-based difficulty progression.-It plays like a point and click hack n slash in an open world, but no traditional rpg elements.-The art is cute and works well with the play-style.-Craft to survive.  Bang on a tree to get wood for a fire, build an axe or pick, even a snare to catch dinner.-If you have played DayZ, Rust or one of the other Survival Horror games, then that is what you can expect, but in an isometric, 2D environment which is a refreshing pov shift for a genre I enjoy."

You search the enviroment collecting necessary items and sometimes even non-necessary items. You encounter monsters. You craft things. It's a game. There are multiple characters. I love it.Pros, things that are good.- Multiple characters with different traits and abilities!- Much replayability!- There are lots of mods to make it even better.- New updates frequently!- GREAT DLC!Neutral, things that can help you and not help you.- Randomly generated world. You could have tons of food, flowers, trees, flint, rocks, other great stuff. And then you could get no food, flowers, trees, flint, rocks, ect.- You play alone. You may have trouble surviving, but you can go at your own pace.Cons, things that are bad.- Day 9 - 11, it's random, gives you hounds to fight.- There are lots of dangerous monsters.Overall, there are more pros than cons, so I reccomend this game to people who like survival games."

And you would be sorely mistaken. The maps are randomly generated, so what was a problem for you last time you played might not be such an issue for you now. That said, the things that came easy last time may not be so simple this time. For example, I frequently found myself running out of food on my first few attempts, while things like developing new technology came easy. However later on food was a bit easier to find, but I had trouble finding the stone and gold needed to unlock new recipes. THEN once I'd finally found a balance, I made the foolhearty mistake of taking too long to light another torch at night. This game is extremely difficult and while normally a frustrating mechanic such as having to start over everytime you die would put me off, I found myself going, ""Well, that sucked. But I wonder what's in store for me next time?"" If you're like me and love a good adventure, even if it tests your patience a bit, check this title out. You won't be disappointed."

The night will be a time that you may find boring at first... in you stuff goes down and you start slowly going insane and attacked by wolves.

I've faced more indecision and planned farther ahead in this game then Banner Saga, Mass Effect, Dragon Age or any other game that touts its ""branching storyline"".

I was attracted to this game due to its art style and cute little Chester. Little did I know this artsy survival game had more to offer than most survival games I've played. Unless you have ROG you're missing out on a lot of content. Don't Starve is far from forgiving, at times you might feel the developers had an evil laugh when coming up with ways to kill us helpless survivors. Don't Starve ROG feels like vanilla to me now, playing Don't Starve itself is not enough to give the game its justice, in my opinion. Don't Starve has a lot of depth, if you're more than just a casual there are so many different things to do on this game besides survive year one. (If you can make it past summer) I do wish, however, Klei put more effort into end game (other than caves OFC) I also feel SW is lacking as an expansion but all in all the price for this game in general feels awfully low for something so wonderful, I would've paid a lot more. If you don't like surviving on your own make sure you give DST a try, the community is great, I prefer Don't Starve over Don't Starve Together but that's just my cup of tea. PS, too the noobs, if you're sceptic due to one death causing your world to be erased, there are items you can craft or things you can find in order to have several lives, not only that, but also mods. The mod community for this game is HUGE, if you ever find yourself bored or feel like you need the game to be a little easier, you could try using mods. Some mods completely change Don't Starve, some make the game easier by adding items and characters, or tweaking things, other mods make the game harder. Don't Starve is a great game and the developers are fantastic and helpful."

76561198122870266,Recommended,219740,11938909,"Posted: 31 August, 2014",all,michaellegg17,"This game.Gameplay: Don't Stave is a survival game which is a genre that has recently been more prominent in games recently due to the success of some game where you punch rocks and ride pigs? anyway Don't Starve in my opinion stands out among the best survival game I have ever played and thats primarily down to the gameplay as its incredibly fun to explore this tim burton style world and survive its dangers. You have a variety of different characters to unlock that each have their own pros and cons and its that diversity which makes playing Don't Starve different everytime you play.. well that and the world is randomly generated everytime you start a new game! so who knows what you will bump into I am still finding new enemies and items to craft and this is coming from a guy who is 20+ hours into the game. Essentially the gameplay consists of gathering wood, flint, stone and food (which is pretty obvious.. I mean the game is called Don't Starve). There are so many items to craft to improve your camp or camps in the massive world you are dropped into and you get a lot of joy from planning out exactly what you are going to collect and make each time you play but that said the game can be a bit overwhelming for new players as you have to think for yourself rather than the game holding your hand which in my opinion works to the games advantage as it adds a sense of accomplishment when you make something to help you survive and if the game told you how to do most things that feeling would not exist and the game wouldn't be anyway near as entertaining. The gameplay is fun and addicting and also stressful at times but not in a bad way as its not the games fault its your fault for forgetting to make a valid step to survive in this beautiful but dangerous world.Story: The story doesn't seem to be the main focus of this game but there is a story hidden in there behind each character you unlock as they are all wacky and have a dark sort of wit to them which I love. The basic premise of this game is that you are dropped into a world by the main villian Maxwell and you have to survive and escape (Or just survive for as long as you can for the lols). There are subtle hints dropped by the characters at points in the game about each characters back story which is very nice.Graphics: This is a beautiful game... its no Skyrim graphical wise but thats not the point this game focuses on art style rather than realism and it works to its advantage as all the characters look like they were taken from concept art by Tim Burton and they are all unique and just as visually interesting as the world of Don't Starve. This is Art.Overall Verdict: Don't Starve is a great game and I look forward to playing it for years to come and I am also looking very forward to the new game mode ""Don't Starve Together"" which is introducing co-op to the game and I am very interesting in that.Note: People that hate survival games should at least give this one a chance as this is what got me into the survival genre."

At first, the game appears impossible and that everything is out to kill you. While not impossible, most things are out to kill you, and survival is using it to your advantage. Then, as you learn what is important, when is the best time to do things, how to do them, where to go (or not go), and why you should, the game becomes ""easier"".Make no mistake, on my current playthrough, I am almost to Day 200 and the game is certainly not easier. In fact, some things have gotten more difficult, and death is around every turn. However, this is what makes the game so great.Then, to top it all off, there is Adventure Mode, which is accessed via an object in the Sandbox Mode (where all games start). While Sandbox Mode could be a full game by itself, Adventure Mode is like checking ""Hardcore"" as you have to take everything you know from Sandbox and use it to make it through all the Chapters (a feat I have yet to accomplish). These Chapters ramp up certain challenges, limit a random resource, etc. Fortunately, this is where the game does let up, as you can repeat Adventure Mode without consquences because you ""regain consciousness"" upon death in your Sandbox Mode to try again. The best part? The Chapters and levels are regenerated every restart, so you cannot memorize the maps, making it truly an ""adventure"".tl;dr You want a challenging game that makes you think, and punishes your every mistake?

76561198108245641,Recommended,219740,32881581,Posted: 27 June,all,EpicAnnihilater,"This game is great. It is very unforgiving and has quite a steep learning curve in my opinion although I haven't played other games like it so I can't compare it to anything else. Basically, the main game is pretty much a sandbox - there's no end-game goals - however, most players will probably make their first many attempts at playing about building a base and becoming self-sustaining. There is a sort of 'story mode' you can access through sandbox mode which provides a different set of challenges too.About the learning curve - when you first start playing, you will die A LOT. The main thing you want to have in mind in this game is that EVERYTHING will kill you if you're not careful. I've played for quite a lot of hours on this game and I still die to the dumbest things - my last run went to about day 30 and I died as WX-78 due to the rain which damages him over time. But after playing some other games for a couple of days, I still want to come back to the game. Dying doesn't really put you off in my opinion (except maybe someone playing for the first time), it just makes you want to try again but just try harder.The DLC for this game is also pretty good. I haven't played Shipwrecked yet but ever since getting the ROG DLC, I never play without it turned on. I wouldn't recommend it to start off with though because while it makes the game feel more realistic and adds more seasons and seasonal changes (bees going aggro in spring, rabbits also not appearing in spring, overheating in summer, a wetness meter when it's raining etc.), it's even more for a newcomer to keep under control."

The game will send you into the wildreness without any tips and you'll learn on from there. Don't Starve is a game that offers a lot but does it slowly so there are those who would find the first one or two hours of playing in a new save (world) boring. The most GLORIOUS thing about it is,exactly,the sheer lack of knowledge. From the first five minutes,you'll learn the basic controls on your own,but you will encounter many new things that you will have no idea what they are and the only way to learn would be to interact with them....Experiment,pick 'em up,eat them,burn them,attack them...Of course,do know that you might end up dead and....Yeah,it's that game. It's that glorious perma-death game and it was delivered very nicely.Please,just,PLEASE don't go looking for 620 kink scope try hard guides on how to be PR0 at this game as it'll just remove all the fun fo learning on your own. It is much better if the player is forced to explore and learn on their own,even if it means going through trial and error.The worlds are always randomly generated which give the game a somewhat different flavour every time you play and let's not forget the different characters with different perks which will affect your play style too.Hunt,gather and make your own camp...Then spend the nights trembling in fear next to your campfire hoping those ''things'' don't gather the wits to come near the light of your fire....And then...When all of that is done and when you think that you've survived the worst,winter comes making everything much harder to get to and,once again,changing your tactics and food rationing.Definitely a game worth playing,thouh I can only imagine this having a small Multiplayer mode. Perhaps two to four players surviving together?"

You'll find out. ;)Update Aug 16, 2014:Well, since I've played this with over 350 hours and counting I thought I'd review it again. What can I say?  I love it.........and hate it. With consistent updates and some new content, it's held it's own. The artwork is quirky and dark and so is the humor. Combat is alive and well and requires some definite planning so I will say to you.....YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED. With lots of unlockable characters to play as and almost complete control over how your world is created by using presets you define or there are a few that are made for you, it has lots of replayability. It also has a large modding community, so you'll not soon grow bored. But do not get me wrong, if you don't like to gather resources, craft stuff (including weird crazy science-y and not-so-sciencey machines) and strategize, you will NOT enjoy this game. Exploration and trial and error are part of the fun.If you use only what is given and available in the game, you will die A LOT before you figure out what works. If you want to play it as is, and I myself like to do that on any game for my intial run through, you will probably have a lot of fail before you succeed. But since there are TONS of videos and walkthroughs and guides as to how to play, there's no need for too much of that kind of early adopter's frustration now.Multiplayer is coming soon to the mix and has the potential for some pretty fun and interesting gameplay if you're so inclined. The expansion is free for current owners of the game and will be called Don't Starve Together. And a heads up, there will be an increase in price for the game with the multiplayer expansion. So far, late summer is here and it has yet to materialize but maybe that bodes well for it to actually work right.Update: DST is a standalone game with many elements that aren't included in the single-player version so it's worth playing both. DST even has a SP mode so you may familiarize yourself with the it's quirks.So gather ye flowers while thee may, pick up those sticks and don't forget that piece of flint over there.  And never NEVER get caught in the dark because while it's true you can't starve if your dead, you can't play the game Don't Starve and BE dead.......unless your in multiplayer and then apparently haunting your friends is FUN! :D"

Every death is a lesson learned, and you'll find yourself saying ""I'll just play for a couple more minutes so that I can build this or hunt that.""  There are plenty of characters to be earned as well, which helps keep the experience interesting.  This is definitely a game where you must set your own goals and plan ahead; if you are the type of player who wants quests and clearly defined objectives, this is not the game for you."

Because of this Don’t Starve is a game that is impossible to review, but with the recently released Reign of Giants DLC, Don’t Starve has once again stolen significant parts of my free time. With tree guardians, giant geese and devastating half-bear-half-badger base destroying beasts taking place in my everyday thoughts, I figured now is a better time than ever to express my thoughts on this truly unique hardcore survival game.Don’t Starve starts with the player waking up into an unknown world, you are equipped with nothing but the clothes on your back, your goal at first seems to simply be: find something to eat. Though as time progresses, starvation becomes the least of your worries, as you discover the world you find yourself in is filled with mystery and threat beyond your comprehension.Don’t Starve is a game of brutal challenge, the one life you are given keeps you constantly on the edge of your seat, death can come at the most unexpected times and each one becomes more painful than the last. This challenge is not an unwelcome one, the repetition can become mundane, and it may discourage some, but the nature of the one life system is necessary to make the game what it is. Don’t Starve would be a very different experience if things were not the way they are.Don’t Starve is as much about survival as it is about exploration, as I mentioned before, the world is filled with many mysteries and things to discover, the world is quite enriching, and the lore is fascinating, nothing about the game is generic or uninteresting. Every character, enemy and locale is unique and like no other. Whether it’s the bunnymen or koalefant, mechanical chess piece, or boy trapped inside a spider. Don’t Starve is a spark of creative genius.Don’t Starve is a game that has really caught my interest, this is not a review, (Though it seems this has turned out in a way that heavily suggests that it is indeed a review.) so I am not going to tell you that you should buy the game of question. (Though technically this is supposed to be a recommendation, at least according to Steam’s standards.) However, after reading this post, (See how I am careful not to use the term ‘review’.) it should be glaringly obvious that I am enjoying my time with Don’t Starve. However, I am not going to recommend this to you as I decided early on that this is not a review. Actually, I changed my mind, I have rambled long enough on this last paragraph and I don’t care anymore. You should buy Don’t Starve. Done."

My old review was made back in Dec 2012 and alot has changed, I've found.Back when I found Don't Starve, it was a good survival, and had round islands connected to eachother from slim 'bridges'. From the beta to now, much changed, much got added and best of all, full mod support via a lua-scripting based API was added, along with full integration for the Steam Workshop.Don't Starve is a Tim Burton-esque survival game based on living as long as you can or progressing through its adventure mode onslaught. You'll have to manage your days to thrive in this harsh environment with several well-fleshed biomes to peck your beaks at. You begin your game as Wilson. A crazed scientist hell-bent on his goal of endless knowledge, promised to him by Maxwell, a dapper fellow who traps him on the unknown island that Don't Starve takes place in.The first thing I want to say, is that Don't Starve's art style and sound design is the best I've seen from an indie game to date, with the entire game being aptly themed to its dark, humerous gameplay, a nice simple, pencil-shaded art style accompanied by lovely OST's which use exotic and well themed instruments. The character voice acting is none existant, instead, each character has a instrument as their vocals. From Willow's flute to Wolfgang's tuba, all suit the characters personality.The characters in Don't Starve are widely varied and have unique abilities and shortcomings which bring different playstyles to each playthrough, keeping the gameplay fresh and unique, while keeping you interested with what they have to say with unique witty examination lines per-character about everything. The world changes around you by itself, Beefalo (the native buffalo herds) will grow, the season will change, terrors grow in the night and the world turns more and more hostile, forcing you to go and --spoilerfied for the sake of spoilerness-- before things get too heated.Combat or survival. You can, if so inclined kill everything you can get on your spear to try and survive, or try your hand at trapping and farming, or balancing the both out as best you can. There are several random events, leading to bosses, treasures and traps as you explore the island, along with newly introduced caves for spelunking.Don't starve still has a few months of development cycles left, and a thriving community still present as it was back in '12.Oh, and its ON SALE (as of review date)!Science! Over and out."

I saw this game in my library and I thought: ""Why not give it a shot?"".So I installed it, and 10 minutes later, whoop, I am thrown into the world of Don't Starve.5 Minutes later I died.And 7 minutes later I died once again.Eventually I purchased the game when it was on a discount later on and I have to say it was well worth it, I got it in a package with RoG.Also one time I had an Alchemy Engine and I was super excited. My food kept spoiling, but I had finally aquired some gears and was like ""YES, FINALLY GETTING THAT ICE BOX."" Sooo I was excited and all, and I was like ""ok tomorrow I'll gather the last supplies"". That night a thunderstorm came, and lightning struck my Alchemy Engine. I starved a few days later.Over all an amazing game if you dig deeper into it. Might seem simple from the outside, but it has A LOT to it. Also, I wouldn't recommend buying this if you hate dying a lot. Because you will.9.5/10"

I'm hoping to get the DLC, Reign of Giants, soon, and I know I'm going to play and love the heck out of it, as well as Don't Starve Together. It can be played and replayed over and over, which cannot be said about a lot of other survival-based games. It was a wonderful soundtrack, and encorperated ideas into its gameplay that I don't think any other game could get away with.The only little thing that I think could be improved upon, (and I've heard this has already been worked on in RoG) is the storyline. The game has a sort of half-developed storyline to explain the general premise of the game, but it doesn't continue after the brief intro or before Adventure mode, which is the majority of the game. I think a few small cut-scenes, or some dialogue, or even just some hints could fix this no-problem.Don't Starve is great, because for once there is a realistic, or in some instances not so very realistic, survival game, that tests the boundaries of what makes good gameplay, and is just spot-on. It isn't the same repetitive old collecting resource and killing monster crud that you get over and over with every low-graphical survival game that becomes popular, but rather it takes that and makes it, throws half of it away, and replaces that with a beautiful, and dark, atmostphere. I think this game is a must-get for any survival, fantasy, or general PC gamer."

The developers have put a lot of work into making this one of the best survival games I've ever played. The art style is fantastic, as is the gameplay. However, the game is HARD, so if that's not your thing.....buy it anyway. You can adjust the world generation to make the game easier if you like. Or even more hellish. The world is randomely generated by the way. This means every playthrough feels fresh. Which is great, because when you die, you die. All of your progress is gone. However, its always your fault if you die. Didn't have supplies for a torch, wandered into a clockwork bishop, lit a forest on fire...punched a pig.

If you don't enjoy dying, then DS is for you because when you die you reset and you gain a new (and hopefully better) world. Also, it is single player, so if you are worried about scoundrels stealing your things, don't worry. If you are afraid of playing alone, you can either play Don't Starve Together Beta, or I also recommend this because it isn't the normal singleplayer terror of dying. In this, you will (should) enjoy being alone, because let's face it, there are some people who prefer the do-it-yourself kind of thing.

Definitely one of my favorite games.It's very hard at the beginning, and still hard after getting used to it, (I still die from the most stupid things from time to time) but that's what makes the game so fun. It's unforgiving, but never unfair. Beside, you can tweak the worlds to your liking if you're having a hard time, like more food, less water, longer days, etc. Or crank up the difficulty to test your survival skills. However, I recommend playing on default setting a couple times before you start tweaking.There is a lot of different characters to choose from too, each with its own sets of abilities, like a pyromaniac little girl or a upgradable robot. There's also a little touch of dark humor that give the game quite a charm. Combine the characters with the world generation's semi-random nature and you get quite the repleyability.I recommend this game to any fans of survival/crafting games, or anyone that want to be alone on a twisted island.However, I don't recommend this game to anyone who likes to feel overpowered. Yes, the game gives you total control over yourself, but believe me, you will be overwhelmed by this game. You will die. A lot. It's not like minecraft or Terrarria where you'll respawn on death, if you die, you lose EVERYTHING. But then again, this introduce the concept of risk to the game. That's something I personally really enjoy since I feel like it gives a lots of weight to each of my decisions, but I can also see how it can be a turn off to some people, hence the warning.Hope you'll enjoy the game as much as I did."

""Uncompromising"" is the defining characteristic of this game. Think you know it all? Think again. Every new improvement, adventure, expedition, could end in death. It's amazing that a game can be so frustrating yet so tantalizing. Every time I die I just want to play more.Pros: Unlimited gameplay potential, hundreds of unique encounters, play your way all day, highly engaging despite the lack of a story line.Cons: Item descriptions are 50/50 on being helpful. When first starting it is very unclear that anything besides tools would be useful, which can lead a player to refrain from using resources for items that are actually mandatory for survival."

In a way, it makes exploring in Don't Starve a more rewarding experience as the randomly generated world always has surprises.The art style is also pretty cool (and scary sometimes).Its a true survival sandbox in every aspect.8/10"

What I discovered is that what I perceived to be a lack of depth was an excess of suckiness on my part.I looked up walkthroughs and was like ""Okay, I got dis.""The truth is, you really don't got dis. Unless you obsessively invest time into this game, because you refuse to die yet another time after such a, what you believe to be, wise investment of time and genius in the relentless wilderness of Don't Starve (which seems to happen to everyone else).In truth, this game is a whole lot of fun, albeit frustrating. There is no lack of persistent challenge, upset, and especially the thing that keeps you going, an overwhelming sense of accomplishment and discovery. The possibilities are endless. And what keeps you coming back is the heartbreaking failure when a giant deerclops somehow destroys everything you have spent hours building in mere seconds.

However, anybody can change game difficulty: add more food or less monsters, and for others who high-seek challenges can be far more harder by adding plenty spiders, pigs, monsterous bosses. That makes just epic game: checkboard robots fight with buffallos when spiders try to kill both of them. More of it, having all kind of supplies trying to kill boss for about 20mins with magic, medieval spikes or even with fellowship pig squad.Characters is well optimised for all kinds of players. Wigfred is just amazing at fights, Maxwell having his own astonishing duplicates of himself, what makes him evil master. Have to mention Woody with his terrible secret, that is just ridiculous!Map has several district areas, what eventually makes you go deepeer in the woods, or even in dungeons against rock skin crabs, mystical and huge bunnies, insane monkeys, or even dragons. Yes, that's right - tremendous DRAGONS!Also, one of the most amazing thing in this game is seasons: i thought winter is hard to stay warm, but when update released summer, it was far more harder to understand how to survive. Although, some of survivers say that this game needs some tutorial, but i think it's better to understand by yourself how to survive, that's what make this game awesome. 9.5/10"

This game is just what you're looking for! You start with a character and have to get them to survive each day and night in the unforgiving wilderness foraging for food, dodging angry spiders and collecting supplies. Come night, you need to have a fire so you don't get killed by the things that lurk in the dark. You'll die a lot at first and it gets frustrating but never to the point where you absolutely hate this game. The controls are great, simply click where you want the character to go and the art is very creepy and old fashioned but pleasantly so!"

One's with zombies, cannibals, even aliens. But this is one of the extremely few that can honestly make me panic and feel miniscule.There simply is no OP equipment in this game, or if there is I haven't reached it yet. Materials are rare, Enemies are hard, stomachs are empty. The sanity meter can be a threat when you don't expect it.The realism in this game can be comical at times, but is serious. There is a lot of trial and error with foods when you first play. Any food you have in your inventory will spoil if you don't eat it, making it impossable to keep a large stockpile with you. This game is definately not for the faint of heart, or for the easy to enrage.Being said, the twist on dialogue is cute, and music is pretty good. Things are however, as they are in many survival games, a bit repetitive. I don't mean the gathering and such, you'll always have that, I mean the biome, while having a few different types of surfaces, isn't all that pretty to look at, which makes it very easy to get lost. There is only one type of tree for each biome, only one model for flint, rocks, gold ect. there are a few different flower types but they grow far and widely apart.You can adjust the game to however you want it to be. Make it literally impossible if you like, or so easy it's not worth playing. There is also workshop which brings tons of content to gameplay and entertainment.Overall this game is pretty darn addicting, not an easy one to forget and definately a great buy.89/100"

You can play in sandbox mode or try to ""beat"" the game in adventure mode (if you can find the portal!), you can build a massive base, instigate battles with a variety of giants, and even explore underground. To top it all off, the art style is delightful. I can't see myself getting bored with this game any time soon. I highly recommend that anyone purchase Don't Starve."

With each playthrough, you get more experience which unlocks new characters which each have their own modifiers that change the playthrough quite a bit. Modifications to all of the world options, from how long the day is to how many bunnies will spawn, make the randomly generated worlds even more entertaining and adds a lot of value to the game.At it's core, Don't Starve is as the title bluntly describes; a game about trying to find food to not die of hunger - but there is so much more, a very detailed crafting system, fun creatures and interesting ways to interact with the environment.

Here's my view on it.]For the few minutes that I played this game when I had it free, it was a plesant expirence.I spawned in a world, in the middle of a desert. There were a few rocks, some bits of tall grass.As I explored some more, I found a forest with some trees and berry bushes.As I was gathering resources though, it became night. I set up a campfire and roasted some berries, keeping myself alive through the darkness.When it became morning, I found a touchstone to set a temporary respawn, and set up shop nearby.Soon I had grinded enough things to create some tools, and was able to quickly mine some rocks to aid my progress to a science machine. After I got it built, I had already created some armor, a few chests, a campfire, some farms and rabbit traps.Then I discovered my new found nemesis: The Hounds. Terrifying pig-dog creatures that attack you around every ten nights, about full moon time as well. I was able to kill the two that attacked, but was wounded horribly.I cooked up some meatballs in the crockpot I had made not too long ago and was able to restore most of my health.My journey ended in the harsh winter, when my crops wouldn't grow, and rabbit were scarce. The Hounds came for me in my weakest state, and I died not once, but twice, after respawning from the touchstone.Sure, I never owned the game from buying it, but I do highly recommend it for the people who like adventure, challange and exploration."

I'll go ahead and get to the point.Don't Starve in and of itself is a great concept, simple at face but so very intricate and complex in the inner mechanisms. You'll find yourself dying multiple times due to your sheer overconfidence, feeling like you've judged the situation properly but dying due to your own malfunctions. There's so much to do, so many different ways to survive, and a huge open world that's generated differently each time in front of you. You can change and edit the world you wish to explore to your own standards, which is amazing.The crafting mechanic is really well made and I love that you have to build higher tiers to get better things.

,Recommended,219740,13983831,"Posted: 14 January, 2015",all,Femme Fatale,"Upon StartDon't Starve is an unforgiving and brutal world. When you first enter, you are completely lost - literally, you have no idea what to do and quite frankly, don't live very long. You have one life, and once you die - it's all over. The game will automatically delete your save file and you have to restart from ground zero. So be carefull before charging into that pack of wild beefalos in a desperate attempt at some meat. Actually, prepare to last only about 7-10 days the first couple of times around; there's no shame in that.ArtstyleKlei chose a very fitting artsyle for this game. The sketchy, gothic looking graphics and the instruments in exchange for voices really bring out the desperation of the player. The general mood for the game is darkness and death. Even the ""creature of the night"" Grue (a.k.a Charlie) as well as the monsters in your mind when you are driven to insanity are but mere shadows.MechanicsYou can pause the game, but I personally have never done it or had the chance to. I feel the button is pretty useless since everything happens in real-time. If you're being chased by spiders and you haven't crafted yourself a weapon, the game won't pause for you until you've crafted it - your only option is to run or die. Everything is done in real-time (game time) so you have to plan your days carefully if you're going out to adventure away from your camp. Bring the proper materials.Health, Starvation and Insanity are the three main things you need to look out for in that order. Health is your death-sentence. Even if your stomach is empty and you are starving, you don't die immediately. You have a couple seconds to pick up seeds or whatever you can scavenge before your health plummets and you die. Insanity is a tricky one though. Crafting items, eating, picking up flowers are general things that bring it up while darkness and monsters bring it down. If you go insane, your health does not drop, however the world around you morphs and changes as you hallucinate your death.The controlls are straightforward with the mouse and keyboard - I have yet to try with a controller so realisticly I can't recommend one above the other. I have a hard time imagining being able to craft items easily with a controler but perhaps the game has a way around that or maybe it's not as difficult as I make it out to be.It's mostly a point and click to craft, you can click to move or use your keyboard. Click on items in the game to interact with them or hold the spacebar.The WorkshopThe workshop mods for this game are endless and wonderful. Plus the developpers have made it quite easy to mod their game so you can have exactly the game experience you want. There are mods to add many more craftables, food, pets. You can even change the difficulty if you find yourself reaching ""end game"" too easily. It is recommended to get a grip of the game first like all other games before beggining to mod it though.End GameThere are technically two types of gameplay in don't starve; one being sandbox and the other adventure mode. When you start a game, you begin in sandbox mode and need to find the portal to adventure mode. Now I've never beaten adventure mode (or tried to), I prefer the sandbox lifestyle but - the game does ""end"" in it's own way even in sandbox mode.Once you've reached over hundreds of days alive and you have your camp fitted and stockpilled with food and fabrications and you've essentially created a base for yourself, there's not really anything left but to start over. This is probably one of the biggest downfalls of don't starve. Once you're settled in, everything becomes too easy and just boring.RecommendationsI would recommend getting the DLC: Reign of Giants as well. It adds a cycle of seasons and so many more features to the game that bring it that much closer to realism and massive immersion. It adds overheating during the summer (similar to freezing in the winter), getting soaked by rain (if I remember correctly, it rains in the base game but nothing really happens) and naturally, giants. That's not all of course but the features are there for you to discover.Whatever the case, playing with the DLC is by far recommended, it shouldn't even be an option to play without. It is an extension of the game that renders it more realistic and adds those features that Don't Starve simply needs.Final RemarksEven without mods though, this frustrating game of live or die will keep you playing. You will hate this game. You will love this game. And then you'll ragequit because you hate it again. Regardless, you will pick it up again and have a brand new experience every single time.Overall Rating:9 out of 10"

Only problem is: it aint easy to avoid.. You wake up in a strange wood without any items or clues to what the hell is going on - done before, yet still this game does it in some very unique and strange settings and somehow thats how it survives ever being a stupid kliche. The entire world got a very gothic, Tim Burton look and feel to it, that on the surface it allmost seems like a casual family game, but its NOT!Starvation is allways just around the corner and foodgathering will be a big part of the game; sometimes even a little to big, cause it forced you to focus on hunger, than on crafting usefull items to progress and for a mayor part of your gametime you have to do allmost the same things over and over..I heard some gamecritic describing the game like this: ""this game hates you."" and im inclined to agree. You dont get any help at all, like hints or clues how to do things or why, so its really about trial and error and allthough that can be annoying as hell, i personally prefer this to the games where the players over and over again gets drown in hints and emfatized keycommands to the point where its doesn't only break the illussion of the game, but allso gets on my very last nerve! Granted the ""i-aint-gonna-tell-ya♥♥♥♥♥♥"" attitude of ""Dont Starve"" can be very annoying to, but at least it doesnt break the illussion of the game and actually it strengthen the gameplay from time to time.Oh yearh, this game allso uses perma-death, so if you die (and you will over and over again), you have to start all over again. You can save and leave the game, but the gamefile gets erased when you die, so no checkpoints for you buddy! Normally im not a fan of this way of gaming, but in this game it actually hightend the intensity of the game, knowing that when you die, all that you have achived are gone! ..well, not totally gone. Whenever you die you get some xp and when you progress you will unlock new char with other abbilitys to play with. (No mayor chance in gameplay but some.)The game makes a random world with random ressources, monsters, etc,  every time it starts over and you can even adjust allmost everything in the world (like worldsize, weather, season, tec) if you want to, so ""Dont Starve"" is very replayable.The controls are few and easy and no mayor flaws there; allthough combat can be a bit of a mess and some times you acidentially use items, when trying to set up a trap or trying to cook something, cause of the point-and-click-system that its build up on and the fact thats its a 3 d enviroment, combined with 2 d characters and items. (hard to explain, see the screenshots or videos..)With all said, it really comes down to this: this game is HARD and it will challenge your patience with.. well, just about everything in the game! Personally thats one of the things i love about, but ""Dont Starve"" is definately not a game for everyone, not even if you're a hardcore survival fan in the first place..I will strongly suggest you try a demo first, or perhaps see a lets-play on youtube, before buying.(written aften 8 hours of gametime)9/10"

Yes, it may be lacking what gamers might be looking for nowadays but, I think the game developers were obviously going for this style. It makes the game play feel eerie but so refreshing to play.Secondly, I love the concept and idea of the over goal of this game, to survive. I know there have been other games about surviving. Don't Starve is majestical in the way that the player gets to take on haunting creatures that when you first come into contact with your first instinct is to get the hell out of there.Lastly, there is a ton of game play to this game and it is a challenge(without using the DebugSpawn) to get through 10 days without going insane or being murdered by hounds or tall birds ext. And that's what makes this game so addicting. You think to yourself ""Oh, I'm going to better next time, I know some better techinques"". The player gradually gets better with each death and eventually gets to the point where they can start crafting an alchamey engine on day 3.Overall, I would reccomend this game to anyone who loves to battel monsters, creatures and staying sane. As well as people who like the crafting concept of making something from things that sometimes you work your bum off to get, it is so satisfying."

Night is also pretty bad, you can't see anything so most nights are spent by the fire.I think this game is best for gamers that REALLY know what they are doing.

If you have ever enjoyed any kind of survival mode in games or enjoy a game that doesnt lead you around the entire way then you owe it to yourself to try this game. For the price it has a lot of life and replay value as you slowly learn the world and get better at surviving. The game also has a decent modding community around it that is easily implemented through steams workshop. Everytime i think ive figured this game out and made it past my last playthrough it isnt long before i encounter some new enemy or hazard that ruins my day. My only complain is that your inventory can get a little cluttered and hard to manage though it hardly takes away from the overall feel of the game. Highly recommend.

The game doesn't baby you or give you a number of tutorials to run through, it just plops you down and gives you the title (which, ultimately, is the goal).  The mechanics are interesting and the basics are made fairly intuitive (which is good because they don't give you any instruction).  The actions can vary quite a bit for individual items, which gives the game a sense of freedom (you can harvest carrots and then choose to eat them raw, cook them so they store longer, use them as bait for traps, etc).  The style is not like any other and they really own that aspect.  From day to night transitions to unique playable characters, Don't Starve is unique and creative.  I am REALLY terrible at the game, yet had a lot of fun playing it (which pretty much settles me on a thumbs up for the game).  If you enjoy survival games, this game is definitely for you."

If you like a challenge or like trying to survive this is the game for you. I can't tell you that this game is perfect, because it's not. However, this is the case for every game. The only problem I had with the game was that I was on day 136 and i'm not sure what killed me. All i know it was invisible. This was clearly a glitch in the game because nothing is invisible, but that's really the only bad thing I have to say about this game.The good stuff! If you buy this game and end up enjoying it. Don't even hesitate if you think you should purchase ""Don't Starve Toghether"" this game is great to play with your friends. However, if you're experienced at the game like me and make it to around day 200 each time. Then you'll probably want to rip your hair out from being frustrated at what your friends are doing.

,Recommended,219740,8680872,"Posted: 12 January, 2014",all,Aza,"You awaken in a strange land with no memory of how you got there. A mysterious figure notes that ""you don't look so good"", and tells you to find something to eat, before vanishing. So begins your adventure. You are Wilson, gentleman scientist, and you have been cast into a world that looks like it was conceived and drawn by Tim Burton. Your goal: survive and thrive. To succeed, you must maintain Wilson's physical health, sanity, and, yes, hunger level. The world around you is full of resources, which can be destroyed, collected, and combined to create tools, shelter, food, and so on. As you progress through the game, you become more adept at magic and science, giving you the ability to shape the world around you in fantastical ways. Beware, though. The world has a copious supply of monsters, traps, and obstacles, and death is always only a misstep away."

When you manage to get your basics together, you'll be amazed at how easily you can die for any stupid mistake. And still you'll be yet to experience the depth of the full game. Explore your map, be curious about everything!"

Still, it's fun when you do remember everything and set up a great looking base.I recommend setting a base up near a source of manure, it's really helpful for farms and growing crops faster. And make a crockpot as soon as possible - after the science and alchemy engines of course. Be sure to set up some rabbit traps too, they are a great source of meat, and meatballs are really filling."
,Recommended,219740,10533807,"Posted: 19 June, 2014",all,Literally The Worst,"Don't Starve is a rogue-like with a gorgeous hand-drawn art style. The game drops you into an open world with no direction or tutorial and tasks you with surviving. The game gets deeper (and stranger) the farther you get in.
