To get more information about this game, I decided to look at a Let's Play(http://lparchive.org/Beyond-Divinity). Some information is good - for example, sneak is absolutely invaluable. Some I'm unsure of, like all the skills he calls useless. One thing I know for sure he's dead wrong about - magic. Magic is wonderful. Magic is incredible. Magic can break the game in half, especially with the wonders of Hammer. Summoning dolls I'm less sure about, but I think they're worth more exploration.To me, this game really hearkens to Warcraft 2 - the music is really reminiscent of something you'd hear during the Orc missions and the cartoonish graphics are similarily familiar (maybe Warcraft 3). It's got RTS-lite gameplay where you control two party members, each with their own skills and stats, with the option to summon more temporarily. The comically bad voice acting is comparable in tone although not in quality.I do have one big problem with it, though. If you click on the wildlife by accident, -all- wildlife of that type aggro you. There's a lot of wildlife. It gets tedious.Overall, I'd say give it a whirl. It's a fun adventure and continuation of the Divinity plotline. I'd also recommend finding the Novella, Child of Chaos - it's a short read that sets up the plot of the game and makes later events make a lot more sense."

The loot system's coding is broken (""Rogues Rags Gloves Blue of the Magus"", anyone?)2. You can, at ANY TIME, teleport to a safe area to buy/sell/ID/Repair items.3. 90% of the subquests, which do nothing to drive the plot, are MANDITORY. It's busy work.4. The steam version does not come with a copy of the novella ""Child of the Chaos"" that was packaged with the game.5. The last 1/4 of the game is a five-story maze where you do nothing but puzzles, read books, learn complex magic rituals and do a lot of extra backtracking. This KILLED the remainder of the game and by the time I got through to the end I just did not care.TDLR:It's not bad mechanically speaking, but the manditory subquests and the last 1/4 of the game just kill the fun.That, and the novella that's supposed to come with the game, ""Child of the Chaos"", does not come with the steam version.

The ending threw me a curve ball that I never saw coming and I felt immense satisfaction from it that was made all the better from playing the first game.  There is no reason to play this game without first playing divine divinity, however.  So if you don't want to play divine then don't play this either."

Not even close to the greatness of the first game.I couldn't beat the first boss fight as it is massively unbalanced. He is two levels higher than you with no opportunity to grind up to his level. When I looked up how to beat it everyone was saying you have to roll a character optimised for combat so most of your character choices get stripped away right at the beginning.The voice acting is terrible. The plot is poor and so forced that not even your NPC companion seems to know what is going on.
,Recommended,219760,18687079,"Posted: 25 October, 2015",all,markegiani,"With already playing Divine Divinity, Beyond Divinity was a game I had to lay my hands on. As DD was one of the best games I've ever played on PC, the expectations were very high.Once again Larian studios offered us a BIG game. Elder scrolls Oblivion was big, but I could say that this one is EVEN BIGGER. With hundreds of quests and vast worlds, BD has one of the BIGGEST worlds in gaming kingdom ! You get to play with your companion right away and can tune him nicely. Also, you can later summon four more companions and then BD looks like a decent RPG. The only flaw is that the skills of characters are horrific. There are too many skills on the menu for every character, but 70% of the skills are useless ! This is not the way you should develop a good RPG. Refer to Diablo 2 : Couple of skills, choose this or that and everybody's happy. That's the recipe to success. Larian tried to get BD very deep in every term and got lost in the half way.However, with good story, many non PC's and vast world, we got ourselves a great RPG. With good graphics and decent sound, everybody can play it if they have a good amount of time. On the other hand, technical issues are over the edge. I don't remember that I have ever played a game with some many bugs ! The more you play, the more bugs get along the way. I even couldn't finish the game entirely because of that and that's why I'll give it79/100"

So i cant compare this to the 1st one or later ones, but i really enjoyed this game. As you can see by my time played, i did a 100 percent complete play thought using a guide. Yes might be cheating but this game can get hard trying to find keys, levers, random quest stuff and i dont have the time to figure every little thing out anymore.With that said i enjoyed exploring so much in this game i couldnt wait to see what was behind the fog of war.The art style was awesome!The story was good and gets better at the end.The game play was well old i mean it is an old game, kinda plays like diablo but way more story driven.In the game you can play in defferent styles like warroir or wizard. I played as a warroir and was dps rocking a 2handed weapon, but you could also go tank sheld one hander. So there is different ways to play.Sound was ok. i liked some of the songs on the soundtrack playing in the backround, and a bonus there is alot of voice acking in the game. The voice acting was ok some were really well played others were lol weird voices.On a side now I picked a random game from my backlog of games to beat and i picked this one. i wasnt expecting to find this gem and or actually beat this game, but it sucked me in and i played only this game till i finished it.I dont recall what i paid but i know i picked up on sale for cheap no more then a couple of bucks its well worth it. Give it a try this game made me a fan of the series and will play the other ones when i get time."

It is frustrating in the beginning and you die often. Here is my tip to get past it. save alot, and RUN if it seems impossible. At first, you need to click on top right icon to select and play as the death knight. Now near top right is option to ""Select all"" You can now fight and control both people at once. You can right click items to send to opposite character if it suits them better. Also click on potion symbol to access all the potions you have, but you have to click it for the corresponding character to heal them.Also near top right is option to set your secondary skills. I set the human to lockpicking and skills can be upgraded via vendors to either add new skills, or in essence increase the max level your skills can get to. If you skip one of the imps, it may not let you get skills to +10 as the imp allows. (Thief skills like pickpocket, sneak, lockpick, etc) I would make sure to talk to him and get enough money for atleast lockpick 10)The torture chamber master seems impossible. Just backtrack after getting some keys to the burning area that you started at where you first meet the death knight. There should be a small bow in top left area beyond previously locked gate. In battle press space much like dragonage origins, and make sure to click select all and then click enemy and unpause. I control the deathknight to hold aggro and have human archer stay back. Your bow will eventually break, but as soon as you can warp back to base camp from the key you can buy repair skill up to level 6, drag the basecamp key into your inventory and topright skill menu, you will see ability to warp to battlefield, which is an area with many shops but also areas to level up at. Skeletons won't level you up so skip the long dungeon full of them. Once you get a little further where you fight deathknights in chambers, you will soon find another battlegrounds upgrade to lvl 2.You can now access new dungeons around lvl 7 area (Keep crossing bridges to the right of battlegrounds to reach these crystal staircase like places) You can only reach the new ones as you get higher level battleground keys.Look for levers around, hold ALT to see items. Make sure to find a large key that allows you to travel to battlegrounds.SEE ISN'T IT EASY TO FIGURE OUT_ OF COURSE IT IS! I recommend playing divine divinity first, i got to lv33 in divine divinity, and want to play through both of these before i get into divinity original sin further. Great game, but not as good as divine divinity, but it feels like an accomplishment to get into this game and overcome the learning curves, to get a new experience much like the previous game, but with gameplay that reminds me a bit of dragonage origins."

Filled with illness people (imps) dying everywhere.You can choose to save the imps or massacer them. I went this good guy way and i am currently attempting to save them.I have obviously not beaten this game yet so i cannot say to much but this is a diablo clone and a good one. I have heard divine divinity is better but i have not played that (yet) so again i cannot sayYou are playing as a prisioner and you have a dark night as a companion. You are both under a spell where your souls are connected meaning If you die so does the other at least until the spell is broken. It puts a nice touch on gameplay and makes keeping both characters alive a top priority.If you find your self in a tight spot and cannot heal fast enough there is an in game pause feature where you can still interact with items and your inventory character sheets ect. This puts a touch a stradegy in the game which is a nice thing.Exploration is also a key factor in this game. You can actually move in game items like boxes and things on the world. somethings maybe hidden underneath like keys potions ect. Not a whole lot of games do this which makes finding things a bit harder that you may need. You can also make map notes to help  you remember things you may forget later like entrances to areas, where someone is ect.your weapons/armor have a durability status as well which adds an added effect of keeping things well kept.I do plan on beating this game so if i have any more to add i will update this.Last updated 3/11/15Definitly worth the $6 you get more then $6 worth of gameplay here.As always this is an older game so keep in mind that it may have issues running on newer hardware I probebly will not get updated any time soon to run on newer hardware now.

This game has some severe bugs that killed all the fun I was having:- If you “alt-tab”, the NPCs move around the map, sometimes even getting stuck behind objects. Thus, you can no longer interact with them.- Many monsters in the dungeons spawn on unreachable areas beyond the walls.- On many quests, I got stuck on the cutscenes, effectively preventing me from finishing those quests.- The quests on the battlefield are always the same, they just change the name of the monster you have to kill. Even the name of those quests is the same.In addition, the soundtrack of the battlefield is really bad.

Repetitivity, general boredom, and no challenge at all provided by enemies after some levels and skill points spent in overpowered abilities, made me quit before ending act 2.Battle grounds teleport kills any challenge, as you can restock and resupply at any time even during combat. Abilities, especially Mage / Shaman one are totally OP and can destroy hordes of enemies with ease.This game is repetitive and boring, it does not stimulate the player to progress in the right way, like DD did.

,Not Recommended,219760,30583802,Posted: 17 March,all,IAMHEREFTW,"I got this game during the winter sale along with Divinity II: Developer's cut, I thought it might be fun I already had and beat Divine Divinity and I thought why not complete the rest of the games apart of the Anthology package since Divine Divinity was such a great game and I wanted more?I wanted to beat this game before moving onto Divinity II. But I don't think I can do it, This game is bad.It feels clunky and broken, If you load to many games in one sitting be prepared for when you will need to access task manager to close the game or else you will need to restart your computer just so steam will stop showing that you are playing the game when the game is closed off and crashed when you just want to start it back up to continue playing.Or when the music starts to repeat the same note after you spent 5 minutes selling all your junk because that is a sign that it is about to freeze and crash so save quickly.I cannot recommend this game, I feel like I am forcing myself to play if I continue. At this rate I am probably [force] playing at least 1 hour of it every month and a half. At this rate I will not be able to beat it before this year ends but that is why I think I am going to uninstall it after posting this review and so I can stop thinking about completing it and just move on to Divinity II.It does have many other problems. One problem being the voice acting, I will not call it bad for a game this old but there is a part where they just used the >exact< same voice recording for the same sentence on the storyline repeated through the dialogue about 5 times. It got really annoying. I can still imagine how it sounded and how annoying it got in my head (/ -.-)I am quiting this game in the middle of act II. I am sorry but I must give this game a thumbs down to warn any who planned to do the same thing as me.

It has much in common with DD, but is less ambitious in scope and not as open (two of its four acts are quite linear).  I guess I'm one of the minority who like it about as much as the original title.BAD- For me it was a bit glitchy--occasionally crashed entirely, with other (non-game breaking) bugs, such as a quest log that wouldn't scroll down and would go wonky on occasion.- Some of the things it tries with the builds don't quite come off.  For example, some of the skills simply don't have their advertised value.  (Advice:  do your research ahead of time, and this won't be painful.)- As others have noted, the voice acting ranges from mediocre to bad.  But sometimes the badness is amusing.  (My favorite was when a single character was voiced by two different actors in the same dialogue, with different accents and everything.)- The balancing isn't always quite right.  The first act is a bit too difficult relative to the rest.DEBATABLE+/- Battlefields are pretty boring if you actually go through the tedium of clearing out the dungeons.  But I actually think the mechanic of having these optional areas works out well--you have merchants whenever you need them, and if you feel like grinding for levels, it's there for you.  (Note:  I did the Act I battlefield dungeons and skipped the rest.)+/- Unless you really want to tackle those battlefields, this game is smaller and less open than DD...but for my money, that's not really a problem.+/- The overall story makes a bad first impression (it looks at first blush like a haphazard mess), but a very good last impression (the pieces end up fitting together).  Unlike at least one other reviewer here, I think the last act is the best part of either BD or DD.GOOD+ Good ol' Larian goofiness is back.  The subquests still have that flavor.+ I think the puzzles here are often pretty clever, and they come at you a bit more quickly than they do in DD--especially in the (more linear) first and fourth acts.+ Having two characters to control adds another layer of strategy missing from DD.OVERVIEWIf you want the finest of Larian's stuff, pass right on by and look to Original Sin.  But if you're on a Larian kick, there's really no reason to skip over this title--it's perfectly enjoyable."

,Recommended,219760,33865637,Posted: 28 July,all,Patcoola,"Very different from Divine Divinity. They went a completely different direction with this game. In this game, you start at the bottom of the dungeon and you are escaping. You have a partner in the game which your soul is bound to. If one of you die, you both die. This game is hard, very hard, escaping with very little from the lowest floor is hard, however, very enjoyable. I like the death knight's personality, and I enjoy the idea that you can do all the quests then kill everybody after to gain more experience. How many games do you know off that you can kill anyone.Beyond Divinity has some improvements over Divine Divinity. Better menus, more meaning full skill/class system, and a second character. Beyond Divinity lacks the deep story and depth of Divine Divinity. The premise of Beyond Divinity is to get as far away from the dungeon as possible and find a witch to unbind your souls, where Divine Divinity has a big open world.Despite the some of the negative criticism this game has received, I found this game to be a breath of fresh air. Beyond Divinity is different from the rest of the dungeon genre and a cult classic that is worth a try."

Unfortunetly It is a downgrade to Divine Divinity in many aspects but it does not make it a terrible game . Voice acting,controls,skill animations,models,boss fights and quality of game in general is not as good .All games in Divinity series have very creative side quests and hidden secrets that you may find by interacting with enviroment . Beyond Divinity is no exception and if you like games that reward exploration then you should definitely give it a chance . Also on a side note this game has good sense of humor and you never expect it beeing caught up in some evil plot ;)Let me just say that I do like this game for its immersion but I do not recommend if you looking for casual RPG. The party system controls are execetued very poorly . Switching between skills of 2 characters during combat is akward even when you get use to hot keys . Skill Systems and RPG portion of this game is not very self explanatory ( you may run into trial and error when it comes to skills more than once )You will have a choice of 3 classes Mage,Warrior and Thief but you can reset skills with gold . In my opinion certain skills were obsolete like Damage Spells that do not scale well into late game . Also this game will allow you to level 2 of same masteries but they do not stack *I want it to be very clear that this game has a very steep learning curve and I did not like the game for a long time myself . This game is a Diamond in a rough . If you hate it on first impression , give it more time and it will win you over .There are some major glitches ranging from FPS loss , enemies not spawning and doors not opening . It may make game broken depending on how compitable your system is with old games . Make a lot of saves .Score 6/10 .

The farthest I got was Act IV. I was in the Academy Level 3. After the rift race my save files keep crashing when I try to load them. I got tired of trying to fix it since I'm not an expert so I'm left with an unfinished story. I hope others didn't have such extreme problems like me but my experience was bad. I don't mind a bug here and there but when it starts affecting the story itself? I have a big problem with that.

Here are my first few impressions before I decided to throw this game out the door. Might be some spoilers belowFirst, I loved DD, however BD at first glance looked like it was going to be fun. It didn't last too long though, some of the first few fights literally steers you away from the game. The DK party mechanics are so horrible, it makes you want to turn the game off. I felt like I was playing a poor mans version of starcraft micro managing 2 characters. So you would think ok, so build this DK tanky and be a wizard or a ranger. Assist your DK while he tanks, nope....its literally a cluster of healing, attacking, and healing some more while you try to kite in a circle.The skills system is a complete mess, offering slash? crit? accuracy? to use your skill points on? Isn't that what your character points already do? not a fan...of this...not going to even go into the ""how to obtain skills""The worst part of the game for me? was the Dark Knight mechanics/party system. I mean this is game killer.  Reloading the saved files 10x because your DK simply is not smart enough to do anything other than die. He stands two miles away while you are running away from the fight. Healing two characters at once (perhaps there's a better way to heal later in the game or I may not know of) from the drop potion icon.My final thoughts? perhaps if you went a warrior/warrior combination it might be more enjoyable. I went wizard with a warrior DK. Some people on the forums mentions archerDK/warrior.  I got it on sale, for a couple bucks, even at 5 bucks its not bad for a old school game if you are capable of dealing with bad mechanics"

I just hope this game doesn't reflect the other Divinity games. Though, to be fair, I did get warned by the reviews that this was one of the worst ones when I bought it. You start off at the character creation screen. And right off the bat i'm jaw dropped at how awful the graphics are on my character. So I note that down and go about creating my chracter. The classes are Warrior, Wizard, and... Survivor? I think you mean *Thief*, Divinity. Anyway, the character creation is pretty bland. I think you have the choice of like 5 or 6 hair styles and you can't really change your appearance at all. So I pick my stats and my generic character, and I think: "" Okay now I'll spawn in. "" Nope. Without explination, they throw you into ANOTHER creation screen for some guy called the death knight. I thought they turned my character into this guy. So naturally, i'm like: "" What the hell divinity? I wanted to be a thie- er uh.... a *Survivor*... Not a knight?"" So tack on an additional five minutes of fumbling with the menu before I realise he's your companion. Could've EXPLAINED that to me. So you start off in a jail cell ( The elder scrolls called, they want their plot back ) and the knight that I had trouble with in the menu comes up to my cell, to speak with me. Real quick, have you ever played a new game and something bad happens and you think: "" Oh No.... It's gonna be one of THOSE games... "" Well this was one of those for me.  In the next 60 seconds, two things about this game became crystal clear. 1: The voice acting... Is some of the worst i've ever heard in a video game. 2: The story is REALLY bad. I'm not even gonna talk about the story. Just google it if you're curious. I played maybe 10-20 more minutes of this game. It's isometric, which is fine. I love the clasic fallout games so i'm used to isometric. In fact, the isometric combat is the only SINGLE thing this game did decently that I can name off. And it's only decent. I also should mention, the backgrounds suck. They're ugly. And why is this dungeon that looks like something from the 9th circle of hell being gaurded by dumb generic soldiers that adress you with "" HEY UHH ERRR HOWD YOU A GET OUT OF YOUR A CELL YOU'RE ONLY LEAVIN HEAR IN A COUGHIN (I know it's coffin Lol)"". Just awful. The exit was locked so the knight recommended I search the cells for a key or something. I try, and something comes out and one hit kills me. Thus marked the end of my adventures in ""Beyond Divinity"". Honestly this game was awful. I got it for like $1.49, and i kind of want my money back. I can't recommend this game to ANYONE. Sale or not. There are better isometric games, and better RPG titles. Every little thing in this game is either a HUGE flaw, or a small flaw that adds up when put together with other flaws. This game SUCKS. 3/10 Simply because the game functions. Hopefully the other Divinity games are better."

The skill system in particular was needlessly complicated. Why do I need 5 skills for one weapon type? 10 if you included carrying a shield. Maybe it wouldn't be so bad if you got more than 1-2 skill points per level. Leveling felt like I was barely inching forward.I loved the first game but this one just failed to hook me.

The voice acting is bad, I mean, really really awful. You also get basically chained to an annoying death knight npc because you and he share souls. You can't be apart and niether of you can die, so you have to babysit both characters. It's pain to micromanage them effectively, because added on to all of that everything about the game (including attacks, enemies. damage, etc) moves ridiculously fast.Another thing is that this game is stupidly hard. I died about 5 times in the first few minutes of the game. This is because my first guy was a wizard, but for some reason you don't start with any spells. My second was a thief but apparently stealth is useless because enemies automatically see you if you get to close. Basically, I got beat to death in a few seconds.It's possible to keep your main guy seperate, so I probably could've beaten the first dungeon, but that means you cannot use the ""select all"" button, meaning you have to switch back and forth to move both characters over and over, which is so tedious. Also, the death knight will just get beat to death if you try to send him in as a tank, so it doesn't solve the problem.This game just gives me a headache, so I decided to forget it. It isn't worth the meager payoff."

Beyond Divinity... the sequal. A brilliant idea...although a little weird...being partnered up with a deathknight.... i was told most of this game is a based  in a dungeon ...but this aint quite true.... A lot of the game will be spent outside (all be it a different planet) There is much more focus on quests and puzzles in this game rather than mindless clicking combat (which i love) from the first game. The stats screens have been changed into a single window to make it slightly easier to use and a very strange system for your skill set...(choosing your own icon and to be honest a bit confusing. First game was better laid out) The game play is very similar to the first game...although there is now 3D characters which to be honest makes little to no difference. The other big change is the battlefield addition. Where you find keys and you can leave whereever you are...and goto the battlefiled (there are 4 acts and 4 differenct battlefields..1 for each act) once you leave an act you cant go back and use the old battlefield.... anyways these are used for small side quests and to boost your stats and find treasure...  I found these boring after a while....as every dungeon is roughly the same layout...(and there are 3-5 dungeons for every Battlefield in every act) so you can imagine getting pretty bored doing the same thing nearly 20 times!  Regardless of a bit of treasure......Ok now to my biggest complaint about the game.... they must have launched this game in a hell of a hurry... they were moving faster than a nuns first curry! There is SOOOOO many F$%^& bugs with this game..... and im not talking just the original release... Im playing the Steam version...but I also have the DVD version and played years bacl with similar bugs....  The game is almost unplayable at points...... The menus in game (quests) the scroll button never worked for me... so cant see whats been done.......cant read conversations either or game crashes...... When you complete a quest .... unlike Divine Divinity where you were given rewards and SHOWN what they are...... this game it just says... ITEM ACQUIRED and if your carrying a lot of stuff which in this game you will.....uv no ♥♥♥♥ing idea what u got and where it is!!...... Then theres the charms..... why in christ would you make a game with charms and absoultely no information about them wotsoever... just a stupid name like...  PAG-YDRA ...and a colour.... so you dont know what your charms mean... manual says ♥♥♥♥ all! so you have to then♥♥♥♥♥♥about online to find out about these things....Also you can use charms from word go....but they are all crossed out.  weapon colours ......again no info, although you figure it out over time...but why cant they just have it all down in the manual and make life and the game easier...battlefields arent marked...so you can have 5 dungeons and 2 keys (2 unlocked dungeons) and uv no idea which ones are unlocked so you have to go round them all..... just these annoying little things missed, for me ...really bring the game down.. making you work to enjoy the game....... I could go on but to be fair the game is still enjoyable even with all the bugs.... the storyline is fairly fun, will keep you ammused til the end.  Overall Beyond Divinity is Divine Divinity on magic mushrooms....It has A LOT of bugs ive only mentioned a few...and if i didnt love Divine Diviinty so much i wouldnt recommend this game... but if you like the first then its defo worth a go... i wouldnt play this one first though."

This game definitely feels like something different and not your old style kind of RPG type. The characters and the dialuge is engaging and the overall gameplay and balance of the game is fair and rewarding if you understand how to properly fight. The later stages of the game even challenge you still. Power-farming isn't exactly something you can do here. I would recommend the game substantially. I even like the story concept. :D
