,Recommended,219890,12989831,"Posted: 17 November, 2014",all,fenster,"Antichamber is easy to dismiss as a Portal clone at first glance; it is a first person puzzle game wherein you move from chamber to chamber, equipped with a puzzle “gun” which interacts with your environment.  But while Portal deals mostly in learning the rules of its mechanics and then adding complexity to those mechanics, Antichamber is a game which aims to subvert your expectations about how a puzzle should fundamentally work.  It makes you question the unspoken rules that video games abide by.  Frequently, it is simply brilliant and mind blowing, though occasionally it’s too obscure or random for its own good (especially in later parts of the game).There’s no real story to speak of in Antichamber, but the entire experience is expertly accented in a very sterile atmosphere and minimal graphics.  Sound design is also minimal, but well done.  Certain audio cues can give you hints to where you are in the world, and the simple tick-tock of a clock can become a fixture of an entire portion of the game.  It’s definitely a polished game which looks and feels nice.Of course, the real meat of Antichamber is the puzzles, and it’s hard to say much about them without revealing part of what makes this game special.  Suffice it to say that it is one of the most unique and creative games that I have ever played.  Environments are frequently non-Euclidean in nature, and rely heavily on perspective or understanding the rules of the universe which Antichamber itself has defined.There is inherent difficulty in designing that kind of puzzle; if you don’t abide necessarily by the rules of physics or perspective that we’ve come to rely on, puzzles can have arbitrarily hard solutions.  For the most part, especially in early parts of the game, Antichamber does an excellent job of staying consistent and teaching you the ways of its mind-melting world.But in the later hours, you are bound to run into situations where a puzzle solution will feel almost entirely arbitrary.  Frustration will set in, and occasionally solutions don’t have the satisfying payoff they were designed for. There was one instance where I resorted to some online hints because, it turns out, I had completed an earlier puzzle in a non-traditional way and didn’t have the resources the game expected me to have.  It took quite a bit of digging before finally understanding how I wassupposedto complete the prior puzzle so I could complete the current one.One very smart addition to curb some of this difficulty is the ability to, at any point, press escape and jump out to the central hub of the world.  From there, you can see your progress and also a map of the entire area you have so-far discovered.  You can jump in to any area you’ve previously visited, and I found it helpful to jump from puzzle to puzzle I didn’t know how to solve.  Typically inspiration would strike somewhere, and my frustrations would yield relatively quickly.Overall, Antichamber is a smart, mostly incredible puzzle game.  Moments of frustration are almost inevitable here, and for the most part the balance is hit just right so that frustration results in joyous satisfaction when you make progress. It occasionally missteps and frustration just leads to greater frustration, but it’s easy to forgive when so much of the game is so good.  Highly recommended."

Consitently, from its first moment to its last, it engages your assumptions and expectations in a way that opened my eyes to the potiental of video games as a medium.  Even through a relatively simple mechanic of interaction with the environment - i.e laying blcoks down and picking them up - it cultivates a very real sense of agency for the player.The game is not linear at all, in fact most of my difficulties happened because I was trying to do some puzzles before I had the rescources to do them. The paths branch off in all directions, and there are multiple ways into nearly every room. Each puzzle teaches you specific aspects of the rules, with later puzzles and abilites building and expanding on those lessons. All of this happens in a place where the laws of physics and spacial reality do not apply. I've had lots of my friends try playing this game, its crazy to see how differently they approach things.My favorite part of the game though is how you create the narrative for yourself.

,Recommended,219890,1547305,"Posted: 2 June, 2013",all,noibn,"Early on in Antichamber, you will come across a room comprised of large floating letters that state ""W T F ?"". This pretty much sums up the experience... but that's not necessarily a bad thing. It's quite refreshing, actually. But let's start at the beginning - what is Antichamber exactly? It's not easy to explain. It's a puzzle game, but the puzzles you solve are not exactly of a traditional nature. The game is set in some sort of nondescript facility, comprised of interconnected hallways and chambers. Visually, the world is quite simple, made up mostly of bright white walls with a spattering of color here and there. You explore in first person and must figure out how to solve each room in order to progress. And that's where it gets even harder to explain. The solutions are far from clear-cut and there is no one main mechanic that is used from start to finish. You just have to think, experiment, and explore. Eventually you will find a tool that is able to manipulate small cubes that are scattered throughout the facility. But unlike in a puzzle game like Portal for instance, the cube ""gun"" is not the only component of the puzzle-solving experience (though it does become so later on). Rather, at first, you will likely just spend a couple of hours exploring, getting lost, and trying to figure out just what the hell is going on. It takes a little while to adapt to how the game wants you to think, but once you have learned how to solve certain problems, it opens up more of the world for you to explore. I know this explanation sounds very vague, but it's almost impossible not to be when trying to explain this game - it is very... unconventional. That said, I thought the game was really cool, though I can definitely see that it would not be for everyone. If you like games that have a clear goal, explain their mechanics well, and don't require much thinking, then this is most definitely not the game for you. If, on the other hand, you are curious to try something that is vague, never provides anything in the way of explanation, and has some truly ""out-there"" puzzles to solve, you just might find Antichamber to be a breath of fresh air. All in all, this is a worthy experiment in the puzzle game genre, and unlike anything else I have ever played. Check it out if you think it may interest you - just don't hold me responsible for how much hair you end up pulling out of your head in frustration.Final Grade: B+"
,Recommended,219890,12486705,"Posted: 14 October, 2014",all,Dinoracha,"A game like Antichamber should not be played by people like myself; games that have puzzles that go beyond merely logic, reasoning, memorization or problem solving and into the realm of beating your head against it until a solution reveals itself do not sit entirely well with me. This is more an issue with myself than those types of games for sure, but while Antichamber does take a couple of cues from Portal, this title is a drastically different experience that, while at times went way over my head, I can still recommend to people who want a puzzler that's different from your Trines or Professor Laytons or Mysts.I'm really the wrong demographic for this kind of game, but Antichamber's advertising suckered me in since I wanted an exploration-based puzzle game in similar veins to La-Mulana; puzzles that were made to crush lesser minds. While I did get that vibe and happily did so, Antichamber sometimes felt like it could get away with whatever it wanted and did so with crossed arms and shrugged shoulders to the player. The Steam store page does say, quote, 'Antichamber is a mind-bending psychological exploration game where nothing can be taken for granted. Discover an Escher-like world where hallways wrap around upon each other, spaces reconfigure themselves, and accomplishing the impossible may just be the only way forward'. 'Accomplishing the impossible' may sound quite romantic to a player thinking about buying the game, but there are some cases where the impossible is possible, it just requires a ridiculous solution. To talk about these cases would just be absolute shameful spoilers and would take away from your experience, but the big pro tip here is that just when you think you've tried absolutely everything and are ready to give up, you actually haven't tried absolutely everything and need to try again. Not every puzzle in Antichamber is this 'impossible', as for a majority of the game your challenges are quite tame; blocks, switches, platforming, interacting with the environment, toying with some anomaly that's keeping you from progressing... Many of these can be solved just through expirimentation, trial and error or simple application of your brain, and for quite some time you can chug through the game at a steady rate, only meeting major opposition when you near the end of the game - And I mean major. Again, perhaps I'm the wrong kind of person for this kind of game, but at some point I ran up against puzzles where just nothing clicked and I found myself spinning my wheels in perpetual defeat, and that's where my enjoyment of the game took a heavy drop.What kept me from really getting sour on the game is that at just about any time you can return to the main 'hub' room where you can look at a map of the 'facility' (players have insinuated there's a story some kind, but there's no plot in Antichamber at all) and then teleport elsewhere. This means that you can zip around the game and try assaulting a puzzle again or from a different angle, never being stuck against just one challenge forever until you complete it. This is an absolute god-send of a feature, and one that no doubt has kept many players (including myself) from quitting the game with a bitter aftertaste. It's also incredibly useful since you can stumble upon shortcuts or alternate exits everywhere that will take you all over the place, sometimes not quite in the direction you wanted to go. If you keep hallway-wrapping into a room you've visited or accidentally fall off a bridge that melts if you're looking at it, being able to warp back and try again keeps frustration down to a minimum, especially when you're trying to find the matter 'guns' to further manipulate blocks that you need for switches, platforms or other impede your progress.The 'guns' is the aforementioned cue from Portal, and how they help you get around the game is the other. Again, to talk in detail about the puzzles you'll encounter would be shameful spoilers, but each new gun upgrade you find unlocks that much more of the game, with a myriad of possible solutions and new challenges to run into, which is a good feeling of constantly asking yourself 'what's next?' when you unlock this door or find a way past this chasm. You'll be looking forward to the next puzzle and not to the designs of the rooms as a whole since the game's sterile white environment at times feels just downright oppressive on the eyes, save for the splashes of bold, full colors that are strangely relieving when mixed in with the 'music' that is nothing but ambiance noises that I feel were designed to keep the player as relaxed as possible when hopping around the game trying to figure out a new solution. Color doesn't play any sort of theme like in Okami, but it does serve as something to take hold of your attention and to differentiate one route from another to avoid confusion.While it sounds like I haven't had the greatest time with Antichamber, I walked away from it (and completed it) quite satisfied with the experience I had, and some minor technical hiccups like major frame-rate hitches during transitions and broken floor geometry were just that - Hiccups. Antichamber brings to the table a wildly different kind of puzzle game that sometimes can feel like it's cheating in order to challenge you, but overcoming these challenges brings personal accomplishment that is its own high. My overall enjoyment of the game left something to be desired, but I can still happily recommend Antichamber to those looking for a puzzle game that doesn't follow conventional rules."

That was a mistake.Pros:- Very abstract approach to puzzle solving, especially towards the beginning of the game. Makes you question everything, essentially.- Mechanics work very well.

You MUST experiment to work your way through this game.- I like the design concept of the ""main menu"".- The graphics are super simplistic (MSPaint simplistic), but I actually like that for this particular experience.(Possible) Cons:- The abstract puzzle solving! For the most part, I enjoyed exploring what I thought might be the solution to a puzzle and being wrong. There were a few times, though, when being right felt kind of dumb.- I crashed the game about five times. Every time was due to one specific mechanic, wherein the game engine is evidently not designed to handle what I was doing to it.- There is no real story and reaching the game's end is underwhelming.

,Recommended,219890,33161259,Posted: 2 July,all,Cpt. Moist Panties,"Antichamber- A ""Metroidvania"" first person puzzle gameThat pretty much sums it up, actually. The game has no narrative, no pause menus, no talking or silent protagonist or anything that signifies this is a piece of software that exists other than the most minimalistic in graphical display and the ability to move about. Even then your movement is walking or running, and a light jump. The soundtrack is just as limited: there is none and there are very few sound effects. It's as if the developer was doing his best to make this game's existence negligible.That minimalistic approach actually benefits the game, as seeing any sort of color behind doorways or any semblance of 'noise' down a corridor adds to the feeling of anticipation and sense of exploration. If you're in a white room and see a reddish hue down a long corridor it naturally makes you wonder what that hue is, and seeing pitch darkness behind a doorway creates the same sense of wonderment. By going with minimalism, the game creates a sense of mystery behind every corridor with good use of color and ''adding'' a bit to the almost ''non-existant'' world. This effect is maintained throughout the game, which I assume took a bit of work. After all, you can only add so much until you've filled a minimalistic world with content.Like Portal, when you subtract a lot and add a small amount here and there, it really creates an impact on the player. Portal did this by placing you in a sterile, impeccably clean training facility. Every now and then there might be a small broken panel you can crouch under and go behind walls, revealing graffitti and the inner workings of the facility. Those sparese moments in the beginning made something as basic as a training facility seem like its hiding massive secrets. By creating mystery through minimalism and throwing the player a bone sparsely, those few times you 'add' to the game or 'reveal' something create more of a lasting impact. It's through this that Antichamber gets a sort of exploratory sense to it that makes the player want to get past that damn door because there's a number you can see in the distance and you wanna know what that's about.Speaking of Portal, this game gets a lot of comparisons with it. It's unfounded, as the types of puzzles in Portal all rely on using a game mechanic in various ways. Antichamber on the other hand is more about thinking outside of the box. It's difficult to explain the way the puzzles work, but as there is nothing in this game in the form of a narrative or tutorial, its all up to you to figure things out as you go along. And the puzzles get really abstract. One of the earlier puzzles has you walking forward and choosing between two staircases, only for the area to loop into itself whether you choose the left or right staircase. You have to figure out where to go and what to do. You might turn a corner and fall through the floor, do a complete 360 and find that you're incased in a room, look up and see a tiny window, look back down and find that you are now falling, land and stare forward only to see you're back were you started. There's actually a room like that.I only have one critique: one of the puzzles was solved by doing something I didn't know I could do because it wasn't explained. The game has a weapon that allows you to move blocks and collect them, and the game does a terrific job of letting you know what the three upgrades can do without telling you a single word. But one rather simple mechanic had me stuck for around 2 hours because I couldn't figure it out.Also, the game ends but it never forms a narrative and all the running around and mystery ends in mystery and nothing is said. I don't like titles with endings like that, but I get the feeling that narrative was never a primary objective here and front and center is the game itself. Still would've been nice to have it all go somewhere.Overall I strongly recommend this; the puzzles are on-point and the sense of exploration is surprisingly strong in a game as minimalistic as this. Who would've thought that subtraction is stronger than addition."

Antichamber is one of a kind. If I was to compare it to any other games I have played, the closest would be the Portal franchise, but even that is only similar in first impression, usage of a non-lethal weapon-like instrument and making you use your brain. There, the similarity ends.While in most other titles the game teaches you in the beginning about its own peculiarities, Antichamber does not. You are never prepared for the quirks of its play with spatial dimensions, unstable matter or anything else you encounter. You are to figure out everyrhing by yourself. And this is one of it's many beauties.This is not a game just about puzzles. It is a game about self-exploration through solving puzzles. The philosophical pictures and phrases that you find while solving puzzles don't only help you understand the weird world of Antichamber, but can also help you in the weird real world.Nowadays there are many games, ranging from Crysis to Portal that to a smaller or greater extent make you think out of the box in order to overcome a certain obstacle. Well, Antichamber isn't one of those. It has NO BOX. You can never be sure about what you will find if you keep walking forward. Or if you turn. Or even if you look back. Or if you look forward again after looking back. Sometimes, you fell as if the only way to solve a puzzle is by tricking the game mechanic and after solving it, you realise that this is exactly the way the puzzle was intended to be solved. At the same time, unlike many other games of similar genre, it strangely feels alive on its own. The rooms, the dimensions do not just stay there where you left them. It leaves an impression that while you are absent from the rooms and corridors, they continue to live on their own. The cubes move around, the walls relocate. As soon as you appear in that strange, distorted universe, you feel alien in there. But this alienation is not of a menacing kind, but of a kind that encourages you to explore the world around you. And as you do that, the Antichamber more and more feels more than an strange trans-dimensional labyrinth.

Puzzles were challenging without ever really feeling unfair (except for one instance: but it turned out to be an optional puzzle so i don't feel like I missed very much.) Great fun for anyone that loves the puzzle genre and can handle the potential headaches of navigating things that don't quite make sense, unless you force it to.Things that annoyed me: There are a few precise platforming moments that feel awkward in the FPS scheme, and there was one puzzle that relied on an annoying jumping mechanic where I knew how to solve it but couldn't make the stiff platforming work 'properly' for lack of a better word.Everything else was fantastic. I beat the game and I still have some puzzles left unsolved. Some of them seem to lead to hidden side areas that only exist for the satisfaction of getting there."

The puzzles were challenging, but not impossibly hard, and very satisfying to complete.As for criticisms, the lack of Steam Achievements was odd, especially since the game actually contains ingame triggers and easter eggs to discover, so it should be a no-brainer. Other than that, a great game.I don't feel it's worth the current price of £14.99. For that price, I would expect some replayability or additional content, for which this game has literally none, which is a shame, and I don't feel DLC would be appropriate, but it might happen.Definitely one to get when it's on sale, as it was indeed a fun experience.Nilesy"

76561197994434013,Recommended,219890,23104096,"Posted: 20 May, 2016",all,Cold,"I 100% recommend this game if you like puzzle games. Most people compare it to Portal, which is a fair parallel although Portal is more weighted towards personality and humor whereas Antichamber is focused almost enitrely on the puzzles and your environment.The game is not super long - assuming you don't get stuck on puzzles for a really long time - so most people are probably looking at 5-10 hours of gameplay before ""beating"" the game unless you are some kind of puzzle god. Fun fact: the world record speedruns around around 2-3 minutes for this game! Of course, the game is always fun to play through more than once and trying to go for speed aids replayability. It's also fun to play with friends though it can be hard to draw the line between bestowing small hints to them and giving too much away so that the puzzle is spoiled.The puzzles reward lateral thinking. Many puzzles can be solved in different ways; sometimes they can be solved before they are ""supposed to be"" solve. Sometimes puzzles can even be skipped entirely. The game subtly hints to the player that the game is more about exploring and becoming a stronger thinker than ""winning"" the game. Some areas don't really lead anywhere and aren't necessary for the technical completion.Beyond the gameplay, Antichamber is an example of incredible design. The visuals at first glance are simple: most of the environment is white. The floors and walls are devoid of detail. There aren't a whole lot of colors beyond white and black in some areas of the game. That's not to say the graphics are bad though. Every visual is clearly thought through and offers a innovative beauty. Distractions are eliminated with this choice. The space through which you navigate is not too small and not too large.The interesting part about the physical layout though is that the game uses a lot of non-euclidean geometry. Not only is this entertaining and fascinating to explore, it lends a sense of mystique to this world you are thrust into. Through the warping of space and dimensional conventions, Antichamber toys with your brain and is constantly threatening to trick your mind.The audio choices are also fantastic for Antichamber. There's nothing distracting - nothing loud or obnoxious - to draw attention away from the game. There is quiet music of sorts, although the atmospheric sound is mostly relaxing noises reminiscent of beaches and birds among other things. It is quiet and along with the simplistic visual design creates a really unique personality for the game that totally won me over right away. The quiet reminds you of how truly empty the space is and how alone you are as the player.You're not entirely alone though. Throughout the game there are simple black pictures present on walls. Clicking these changes the picture into a brief sentence. These sentences are usually vaguely motivational in nature and also serve as subtle hints to aid in progressing further into the game. I adore their presence and it really is a great example of design. It makes you feel less alone because it's almost like the game is sentient and congratulating you when you discover new areas.There is no narration to the game, no real characters, no story, and no explanation even when you win. Similar to a game like The Stanley Parable, Antichamber forces you to draw your own conclusions. Is it just a cool game, or is there symbolism to be found and suggested meanings? It's up to the player to decide whether or not to try and delve deeper or not. Open-ended experiences always tickle my fancy."
76561198112059304,Recommended,219890,13799210,"Posted: 2 January, 2015",all,Pannacone,"The game opens with players spawning in a small, black room with a cartoon-style picture of a fetus on the wall. The first thing the player sees are these words: ""Every journey is a series of choices. The first is to begin the journey."" Players then turn to find a second wall labeled ""All You Need to Know"" that displays the options and the control scheme for the game, as well as a third wall labeled ""Choose Your Destination"" that acts as Antichamber's sort of level select feature. The map on this wall is initially only one room big, forcing players to select the very first room with only a vague idea of what this first ""level"" might hold for them.From there Antichamber is very loosely organized, with players often being presented with multiple paths that lead to separate rooms on the map. Antichamber is often called a puzzle game, though its developers have more accurately labeled it a ""mind-bending psychological exploration game"". And in order to play Antichamber, your mind will have to bend—often into complex, pretzel-like contortions. The puzzle rooms of Antichamber frequently involve doing the opposite of what you expect. Each one requires creative thinking and the rooms often make up there own set of rules in order to solve them and then expect the player to figure each one out. Some rooms want you to walk quietly. Some rooms are shy and don't want you to look at them. Some rooms will only play fair if you walk backwards the whole time you're in them. Each puzzle is odd and unique, though I rarely found myself being frustrated. More often, I was enamored with their perturbingly unorthodox logic.Should players grow irritated with a puzzle, however, a simple press of the ESC button will bring you straight back to where you started: the Main Hub. As you continue through the game, your map slowly expands into twisted corridors with labeled puzzle rooms listed on it, allowing you to transport yourself to any puzzle you've already encountered (though not always solved!). Along the way, players will often come upon black and white signs hanging on the walls in the hallways of Antichamber. The very first wall of the game, called the Moral Wall by fans, collects these signs, each one a black and white cartoon picture containing some sage words of advice when clicked.The true beginning of Antichamber begins a handful of puzzle rooms in, when the player collects their very first Matter Gun, a weapon whose only ability is to collect and shoot out little colored cubes. There are five Matter Guns total, with each new gun being an upgrade from the last.  Each one comes with its own set of abilities and rules that make more complex puzzles solvable, but in order to use the guns players are required to discover these abilities and rules with very little direction from the game itself. It's this lack of direction that makes Antichamber so clever: the game never tells you how a puzzle should be solved or even how to use most of the equipment it gives you to solve those puzzles. Players are required to pave their own way, developing and creating new techniques to tackle constantly changing challenges and sticky situations. Soon players end up with a large set of skills that have slowly been discovered through hours of trial and error.Antichamber's journey has a quiet, unstated goal: there are no waypoints or quest lists to follow. Your only clue on where to go is the mysterious, flowing worm of black matter that appears early on in the game and the undeniable urge to delve deeper into the mysteries of Antichamber's hallways. However, a game like Antichamber does not need a strong sense of character or story. Antichamber places a higher value on gameplay and ingenuity than narrative, though the game is no less immersive because of it. In fact, Antichamber's atmosphere is enhanced by the silence of its white hallways and the player's fumbling, stumbling exploration of its convoluted structure.People often believe Antichamber to be a sort of Portal clone—you're locked in an inescapable labyrinth, armed with a dubiously effective gun, and presented with a series of puzzles to solve. However, Antichamber is barely comparable to Portal. It is a more somber game, with a much less linear style of gameplay that is focused more on discovery and learning than the progression of a plot. You do not connect things, you create and destroy. You guess and postulate and trip and balk. There's no smooth sequences of flying through the air or near misses with laser beams or perfectly timed jumps. There's only a slow contemplation and the constant sensation of reaching into a dark hole and feeling your fingertips graze against something warm and smoky before it just slips away.There are some games that I'm afraid to review. They're often games that, no matter how hard I try, I can't seem to find any noticeable flaws—games that I've become so pleased with that I would almost dare to call myself biased. Antichamber is one of those games that I've fallen in love with, a kind of unflinchingly blind sort of love that leaves me unable to see any of its faults. As such, it's no surprise that I'm giving it a positive review with the addition of a rarely ordered command: buy this game. Buy it now, and let yourself flounder in its often backwards and inside out logic."

It is able to fake you out several times where you think you know the answer but it turns out it was something different than expected.Neutral:-Game is pretty short.  Nothing wrong with that, just keep that in mind.-It is possible to skip several of the puzzles unintentionally if you figure out harder puzzles before the game ""teaches you"" to solve them.-No controller support.Cons:-No 1440p support baked in.  You have to modify some of the files yourself to get that.  Surprised this was an issue for a game from 2013.-Huge fps drops for some parts of the game. For referencing I'm using an i5 4590 and an R9 390. And while the game's suggested specs make it seem like it could be played on any computer made in the last decade, I played maybe a quarter of the game between 12-18 fps.  Other areas were a perfect 60 fps.  There are particular times this happens, and it usually has to do with how the game is routing you through the map.  I don't think there is any avoiding this.-Modest screen tearing despite repeated attempts to resolve the issue.-Poor control of character/tools.  There will be times you second guess yourself if you've found the answer to the puzzle or not.  It will turn out that you have found the answer, but it's more difficult than expected to pull it off because of both jerky or too fast motions.  It reminds me of URU this way.  The challenge should be solving the puzzle, not getting the mouse to click the thing you want.-Only one save file at a time unless you copy and store multiple saves yourself.  Hard to share with friends/family this way.-The game crashes for me toward the end when there are too many bricks around (at least I think that's the problem, not sure).Conclusion: I view a ""thumbs up"" as meaning you should buy this at full price.  In my view it's not worth full price.  It's a fun game that is refreshingly bizarre, but it seriously lacks polish.  There comes a point where I have to judge the game more for how it plays than for what it was ""going for.""  Conceptually, it's an A+.  Execution is a C.  Wait for a sale and pick it up then."

After playing it myself, I have to say this game feels more like ""learning to *think* backwards.""Antichamber is a first-person puzzle game that plays with the idea of non-newtonian space. This means that if you walk down a hallway and turn around, what's behind you isn't necessarily the same as what you just walked through. There are a couple of points in the game where the only way to progress is to walk right back where you came from, which turns out not to be the same place at all.The process of learning to deal with non-newtonian space is confusing for some, although I have to admit that I am not one of those people. If you approach each room as a puzzle and ignore your ideas of what is in front of you or behind you, (as well as some real-world ideas like 'common sense,') the game itself is not actually very difficult.What nailed this game for me was the atmosphere. Set in what many have described as an Escher-esque world, the game's stark minimalism and use of visual space meant that even though the entire complex is built out of white walls, there was always something interesting to look at or think about. In some ways, I found this atmosphere to better than that of Portal - while GlaDos made the Portal series fun to listen to, with an ever-present and witty dialogue that provided much of the tone and narrative depth for the game, Antichamber removes the narrator entirely and forces the player to decide how much - or how little - narrative is present in the game at all. The lack of a Narrator Voice lets the game's own tone settle in the player's thoughts more closely, a tone that I can only describe at varying times as 'child-like discovery' and 'calm confusion', as oxymoronic as that last statement might seem.Antichamber is the kind of game that is best played without a guide, not knowing where to go next, with as much or as little confusion as that might bring you. This is one of those few interesting games that can intrigue storytellers and non-story gamers alike with a dialogue and narrative that barely exist, in a setting that does not conform to the vast majority of popular videogames."

Assume if you walk around a corner and then walk back around the same corner that you'll end up in the same place you started from?

It'll be a bit tough at times but it's definitely worth it!Antichamber is a great puzzle game that has a good balance of pacing. At times you'll pick up on things quickly and move along at a good speed but at other times you'll have to step back and really dig into the puzzles to understand what's going on. You may have to leave a specific area only to come back later once you have the knowledge of how to finish a puzzle, but it's a great reward! There are also areas that hint towards specific rewards and help push you forward knowing what you'll eventually find.The game does have some downfalls. At some points, specifically towards the end, progress could be grinded to a halt as you may think you're doing something wrong but a mechanic just isn't working correctly. I've had times like this (only 2 or 3) where I could not advance because something was being finicky. I wouldn't hold this against the game however, as after a short time of trial and error or just leaving the area for a short time things seem to fall in place.Overall, I really enjoyed Antichamber. I've wanted to play it since release but just never bought it. I purchased it on the Winter sale of 2016 for $3 and would honestly have paid full price if I would have known how much I'd enjoy it. I sat down for 6 hours straight through completion because I was glued to the game. Even though I've beaten the game I still plan on playing, something I never really do! If you like this game, definitely pick it up especially if it's on sale!"

No clear instructions or objectives beyond cryptic motivational posters are ever given, and even when the player stumbles upon a block-manipulating gun, it's not immediately clear what the rules of it and its upgrades are.  This forces the player to explore, experiment, and think outside of the box, as the individual puzzle rooms are themselves just pieces in the giant puzzle that is the entire game.  While a minority may find the confusing non-direction of the game frustrating and deceptive, overall Antichamber is a unique and surreal game experience that keeps the player guessing right until the very end."

Other puzzle games will base themselves around basic physics, physics with some neat twist (e.g. Portal), or a few unique mechanics (e.g. The Talos Principle), but with all of them you start at the same basics and learn maybe one or two new things to keep track of and work from there.Antichamber is a whole new things, because it plays by a different set of rules and doesn't tell you what they are, you have to figure them out. Other puzzle games explain there puzzle solving device (Portal Gun, Jammer) and it's uses (Light Bridges/Energy Pellets in Portal, Fileds/Turrets/Switches in Talos) and then make minor variations to the same techniques you've used to get you through. Granted, some games (Portal 2) introduce a few new things (Gel, different kinds of buttons I guess) for you to figure out but it's always explained and eases you into it.AnitChamber (as I just said) writes a whole new rulebook, and then lets you figure it out. The things that at first seem random and inexplicable you realize follow their own rules and patterns, walls disappearing, floors breaking, rooms changing when you turn your back, windows that let you step into other rooms, it all follows a set of rules, and this game is more about figuring it out.The negative reviews here mostly complain about unsolvable puzzles and having to brute force your way trough things or look them up and a lack of guidance. I can say that these people are wrong. This game guides you (albeit in a strange, indirect way) through the puzzles and rooms, and the puzzles are never unsolvable. Some of them are diffficult, but never unsolvable.The game makes use of a system allowing you to leave and travel to other rooms at any time, making the backtracking you have to do very simple and quick, and it makes the realization that you've stumbled into a room you are currently unequipped to solve that much easier because you're never more than four clicks away from going back to a fork in the road, a room you want to take another crack at, or a puzzle you know you can solve now.Just like in the original review though, I still have one complaint: this game has ruined puzzle games for me; games like Portal or the Talos Principle hold very little interest to me by comparison to this game.Original (much more subjective) review:Hands down the greatest puzzle game I've ever played. Everything from the mechanics to the aestetics and controls work wonderfully together to create an experience unlike any other game I've played to date.I honestly wish I could remove my meories of this game and play it again as a fresh experience.The only real complaint I have about this game is now puzzle games like Portal hold little interest to me by comparison."

,Recommended,219890,25507153,"Posted: 14 September, 2016",all,SkullFire58,"Antichamber is definitely one of the best puzzle games I've played. It's a very unique experience that plays with your perception and makes you think outside the box. It has a very bright color pallet that helps point out specific points of interest (although it can strain your eyes after a while), and it has some very interesting uses of ambient sounds. As you progress, you will find images on the walls that, when clicked on, will give you quotes about life experiences while also acting as hints on how to solve the next puzzle. On my first playthrough, I was completely lost in barely the first quarter of the game, mainly because I didn't realize that there are mechanics to this game that can be applied elsewhere. I returned about 1 or 2 years later, and beat it in one day, slowly remembering some of the things I did wrong the last time I played. The game may be daunting at first, but it's much more possible than you may think.Another great thing about this game is that I can't recall a single puzzle in here that I would dread to do again on repeat playthroughs. In most puzzle games there's usually that one puzzle that you absolutely hate to do and you typically stop playing there. Even if you know the solution, it's so frustrating and uninteresting that you loose the motivation to continue playing. The most annoying puzzle in this game wasn't all that annoying once I figured it out, it only took me about 10 minutes and it was optional. It just unlocked a special room that was not required to beat the game, it was simply a nice bonus room.I do have some tips to save first-time players from unnecessary agony:Remember every game mechanic the game shows you, they aren't just one-time gimmicks.In the beginning, the game will throw a lot of new mechanics at you one at a time, which made me think they were all one-time gimmicks. I eventually became stuck for a while because I didn't realize I had to use one of the mechanics from earlier. I restarted my save file, was re-introduced to that mechanic, and finally realized what I did wrong. Just make sure you remember every mechanic the game shows you, no matter how insignificant it may seem at the time.Most rooms and interactable cubes are color-coded. If your current or any previous guns do not match the color of the cubes, you probably can't solve that puzzle yet.This is an issue caused by the non-linearity of the game. Often when I encountered a new puzzle, I was never too sure if I couldn't complete it because I was missing a tool or ability, or if I was just not seeing the answer. To prevent this from happening, just keep in mind that most puzzles that involve interactable cubes (the kind you can pick-up and place) are color coded to match the color gun upgrade you need to solve that puzzle. I don't want to spoil much, but you'll understand once you're further into the game.You can never quite get your bearings.The non-linearity of this game also creates a problem with your spatial-awareness. The game has so many twists and turns, and some areas and paths are different depending on you current actions. This becomes very disorienting, and there is practically no logical way to map the game out in your head. There is a map in the game, but it's mainly used as a fast-travel system and to give you hints on where to look next. The layout does not actually make much sense. You kind of just have to keep wandering around trying the different paths until you get somewhere new.Finally, some personal gripes about the game. There are a couple of ""dead ends"" in the game, they're puzzles or rooms that seem to exist for no reason. It left me a bit confused as to whether they were put there intentionally to add to the feel of Antichamber's universe, or if the developers actually forgot to remove/finish it. There's even a door that is labeled ""Under Construction"". There are also pink cubes scattered throughout the game. I was really interested in these, as they seemed to be some kind of collectible. Upon further research, they were actuallysupposedto be collectibles, but the feature was never fully implemented. Nothing ever happens when you collect them all, and there are even some that are completely unobtainable.Aside from it's flaws, this is definitely a game that should be experienced at least once in your lifetime, and is a remarkable technological feat."

It puts you in the mindset that you yourself are legitimately trapped in a labyrinth and you need to find your way out.

It will force you to think outside the box. And that is not an easy task for most of us.The game itself consists of a mostly seamless world (until you get to a part where you're being forced to teleport out of it), with puzzles in every corner. Not all of these puzzles have to be finished for you to complete the game, but you do have to collect the 4 different guns in order to advance and finish the game. Once again, not an easy task.I'd love to explain some of these puzzles to you but that would spoil them and it's too difficult to even try anyway. It's something you have to experience, if only for a short while.Antichamber has another cool feature; the use of in-game achievements. The rooms use icons/pictures and text to act as in-game achievements. Seeing them lets you know if you've been there before and it might even give you a subtle hint on what to do. You'll have to solve every puzzle there is so fill up your wall.It would've been nice if there were Steam achievements involved as well, but hey, you can't have everything I guess.One annoying thing is that if you press Escape you have to start over if you wish to continue the puzzle you were working on. There's no pause button, if you press Esc you're back in the 'main menu' where you can select which puzzle you want to solve and see your achievements. Quite annoying if you want to take a little break.Oh, as you may have noticed the graphics are a mix of simplistic, artistic and futurustic styles, and while they're not always hi def, they're cool to look at. It's really something special.Hmm, I don't know what to say to you. I wish I could recommend this game to anyone out there, but I think it's a 'love it or hate it' game.

,Recommended,219890,30463996,Posted: 11 March,all,AncientPancakes,"Welcome back everyone. Today I'm takin' a look at Antichamber, a mysterious exploration-filled puzzler buster of a title. I'm not the most experienced when it comes to games of this genre, but I walked away from this with a pretty solid sense of contentment in my belly.Right off the bat, here are some things I didn't quite like about Anitchamber.The game is pretty short, probably around the 6-8 hour range. Your time spent on this will vary depending on how long it takes you to complete the puzzles, if you use guides, and if you know where you are going, but it's certainly more comparable to a delicious double-chocolate cupcake rather than a triple-layer funfetti birthday cake.Throughout the game you acquire a couple abilities that make certain puzzles possible, but I found myself getting frustrated that I couldn't tell whether the puzzle I was trying to solve was even solvable at this point in the game. ""Do I need the next upgrade to get past here?"" Those are the words that were spoken in my mind.Outside of these issues, Antichamber is a real psychedelic trip through a clusterball labyrinth of mind-bending chasms and confusing conundrums so confounding that it would make a goose liver take a swift elbow to the gut before it could understand what lies before it. The puzzles are a real treat in this game and they made me think outside the box to solve them, especially the ones early on.There really is no feeling like trying to solve a puzzle, and you endure a solid 15 minutes of mentally taxing brain processing before you discover the simple solution that seems so obvious in hindsight. It's really something to experience that lightbulb moment where it all comes together and Antichamber really NAILS IT when it comes to this.This is not a title I would recommend to anyone, but for those of you who are into this style of puzzle-ish problem solving mystery crackin' nonsense, I think this would be right up your alley. Well-made game, simple and effective design, difficult and interesting puzzles. Maybe not worth 20$, IN MY OPINION, but it's certainly one of the wackest games i've played in some time.To put things simply, if Antichamber was a type of co-worker, he'd be a quiet, moody lookin' guy who can really grind your gears sometimes, but then he brings in sprinkle donuts for everyone and you realize he's a stand-up fellow.

Now there's a sentence that doesn't apply to most games.The visuals are very simple; the hallways are mostly white, with only black lines to indicate where corners are. Colors are very important in this game; they can help you orient yourself as the world changes around you (did I mention that you can be walking down a hallway, get to the end, turn around, and see a completely different hallway behind you?). The color of your gun also determines what its powers are. There are several sections of the game, each requiring a different gun to solve its puzzles.Speaking of puzzles, they are a doozy. Because the game does not rely on traditional notions of geometry, they can really do whatever they want. I don't want to spoil any of the puzzles, but don't feel discouraged if you can't solve one the first time you try. Sometimes there is a tool or technique that you have to get in a different chamber first. And even if you get completely stuck, you can just hit Esc at any time and go to the Antichamber.The antichamber serves as a main menu. The game's options and controls are all plastered over one wall, a map of all of the chambers you have been to (you can travel to any one of them from the antichamber) a view of what claims to be the exit, and a big chalkboard of the lessons you have learned.Those lessons are my favorite thing about the game. They are often placed just before or after a puzzle, and they contain a life lesson that pertains to that particular puzzle.I've played about three hours of the game, and I have discovered two different colors of the gun, and I think there are two more. I'm kind of stuck though, and I might have to bite the bullet and look at some walkthroughs.I would say that a reasonable price for this game is $10, so you should definitely wait until it is on sale to pick it up."

In order to overcome all of the self-constructing walls, false passages, and invisible portals of the labyrinth, the player must indeed take a few steps backwards, by abandoning his or her sense of spatial reasoning.Besides the dead-ends and regressions, there are no enemies in Antichamber, and the only shooting comes in the form of an upgradable, cube-shooting device. Developer Alexander Bruce proves himself a master of extra-dimensional gameplay, creating challenges that push the player further and further beyond the comforts of conventional physics. He also preys on a few gaming conventions, from a tutorial which must be disobeyed in order to advance, to rooms which are best navigated by walking through them backward. One of Bruce's more frequent tricks is to make many divergent paths lead to the same destination, rendering the player's choices irrelevant. To avoid covering the same ground under the illusion of forward progress, the player must move slowly and be perceptive.Thanks to some incredibly polished audio and visuals, it is quite enjoyable to move slowly. Crisp sounds and rich colors create an other-worldly atmosphere, completed by Siddhartha Barnhoorn's ambient compositions, which feature digitally-manipulated recordings of Japanese instruments. The graphics are functional as well as beautiful, with correct paths often presenting themselves in recurring shapes, colors and sprites. Responsive control guarantees that you'll get around easily, even when building cube stairways or leaping across chasms.The average player should be able to complete the game in ten to twelve hours (although experienced gamers, Bruce claims, will have a harder time with certain challenges that were designed to counter traditional first-person tactics). Ten hours might be a little more bewilderment than some can handle, and the second half of the game, with its emphasis on cube manipulation, can get particularly dizzying. If you are prone to existential nausea, I would recommend this game in small doses.What makes Antichamber so absorbing-- and in my opinion, important-- is that it allows us to experience impossible geometry. In Bruce's words: “Things that are completely incomprehensible by looking at mathematical formulas on paper, like quantum mechanics or non-Euclidean space, [are] presented in a way that allows the player to interact with them more directly and understand their ramifications.” In the real world, we will never experience a closed loop with an exit point, or a single door that opens onto an unlimited number of rooms. We will never take a step that moves us in more than one direction, or jump down a chute to find higher ground. Antichamber gives us these mind-altering opportunities.TL;DR -- An immersive and puzzling, three-dimensional exhibition of four-dimensional space."

Near impossible to put down. I was a little frustrated at times because I would be naturally stuck... and after a long while do something accidentally, and  find out a power I didn't know I had. Traveling to past sections, searching for the next step was also time consuming. But even though it may seem like it, I am not complaining. I had a really great time figuring out the puzzles, and enjoying the beautiful colors and art (Wow. I'm such a girl) And the struggle is what made it worth while, because who wants a game that doesn't give them a little challenge? There are also a lot of secret areas in this game, which I always find fantastic. If you want an adventure... with life lessons, puzzles, colors, blocks, weird, weird art, and absolutely no explanation of what and why you're doing what you're doing, then this is the game for you. I bought it during the Steam Summer Sale, and it was my favorite purchase so far. Right now it's $20, but I still beileve it is a great buy., with or without the sale."

My expectations for the game were quite low to start off with. I thought either the game would be really easy or the puzzles would be too hard because of illogical and random solutions that make now sense.However after playing the game for about 2 hours online and 5-6 offline, It is easily the best puzzle game i have ever played. Some parts were unbelievably challenging and none of the solutions were thrown in just to add an extra 20 mins of gameplay. The game allows you to slowly evolve through the gameplay mechanics in a subtle way and there are multiple ways to progress depending on how early you figure out different things.   If you're into deep puzzle games and don't mind back tracking through the game a few times... definitely pick this game up. :)My only one problem with this game is now that ive given it almost 10 hours, i've completed it ... i have discovered all the easter eggs (i think) and i don't see any viable DLC for this game, so there isn't much replayability. Still i highly reccomend it."
,Recommended,219890,10000538,"Posted: 2 May, 2014",all,tzumainn,"I felt smart playing Antichamber - well, some of the time.  The rest of the time I felt extremely stupid.  Antichamber is a game that can do that to you.  The concept is simple: you are traveling a maze of rooms, attempting to reach an Exit.  However the way through each room is never clear.  Some rooms have invisible bridges; others have breakaway floors.  And many have physically impossible architectures, the traversal of which may require something as simple as walking instead of running, or as subtle as refusing the presented paths in favor of something far less obvious.The game does provide hints in the form of illustrated signs with varying levels of helpfulness.  ""Moving through a problem slower may help find the solution"" was illuminating.  ""Live on your own watch, and not someone else's"" made me want to punch the wall.  For me, the majority of the signs were like the latter, and not the former.And yet, I can't deny that solving the challenges sparked a strange species of delight in my brain.  Transitioning from utter frustration to an almost primal delight is an effect that few games have had on me, and one that I would not have expected to find in a game that is all about mental taxation.I haven't finished Antichamber, and I suspect I never will (playing a game like this with a FAQ feels like missing the point).  But that doesn't mean that the game didn't have an effect on me.  On the balance though, I'm just not sure it was an enjoyable one.---- Labyrinth: A Failure -------------Once upon a time, I tried to write a story called ""The Minotaur in the Labyrinth"", a re-telling of the famed Greek myth. The twist? In my version the Minotaur is not some ravening beast; instead he possesses both reason and civility, and he is fully aware that he is a martyr of the gods' childish whims.But rather than despair or rage or fall into self-pity, the Minotaur discovers hope in his situation. Trapped in a Labyrinth constructed so well thatnot even the gods can penetrate its mysteries, he recognizes that he has been presented with a rare opportunity.And so when victims are thrown into the Labyrinth he does not devour them. He shares with them a vision of a life free of the gods' capricious influences; for within the Labyrinth, the gods have no sight. All that needs to be done is to labor from the inside, work to expand the Labyrinth until it grows to cover the island of Crete. And maybe, the Minotaur thinks, maybe there is a way to have it enclose the oceans, and from there the whole of Greece, and then the world itself. A global paradise.I liked the idea - still do! - and made serious efforts to create a narrative out of it. My first attempt was told from the perspective of Theseus and the story was told straight, an adventure tale with a lyrical tilt and a mystical epiphany at the end.It did not read well. It was overlong and somewhat toneless. I tried to introduce some overt humor by turning Theseus into a musclebound cretin, but quickly discarded that idea as cruel. Then I tried extending the narrative distance, giving the story a more legendary feel. That didn't work either.I had the Minotaur speak in a modern voice in opposition to the Greeks' archaic speech. I turned the story into a tragedy by having Theseus slay the Minotaur. I tried many different things, all of them failures, and one night while lying awake in the dark reflecting on other possible choices, I came to the sudden realization that I had, in effect, trapped myself in my own Labyrinth. I was traversing a hundred different paths looking for the center of my story. And I feared that I was nowhere close.So I let go. Not every maze can be solved, and sometimes it's better to just to move on to other things.  Maybe my subconscious will solve the story someday; that has happened in the past. Or maybe it will forever remain half-formed in my mind, a never-realized dream. There is no great tragedy in that either.I will say this. In every attempt I made, there was one phrase I kept:rays of sunlight lilted their way through the verdant canopy.Not the most earthshaking use of the English language, but even so.  I loved the use of the word lilt, how it turned golden light into song.The phrase will stay in my head, I think. And perhaps that's center enough for me."

That and the soothing, soft ambient sounds and music were so mesmerizing that I actually lost sleep while trying to solve the riddles.  It's art therapy in a way, which eases the otherwise extremely painful mental anguish that would melt lesser minds (yes, this game is not for the faint of mind unless you're daring, but I recommend it anyway for its looks).Having been very well-trained with the Portal series (and even seeing some workshop maps which imitate the classic ""many paths to nowhere"" room), I kinda knew what to expect.  Plus I love to explore.  Here you're exploring not with a portalgun, but with a 3-time upgradeable cube gun, which you use to solve various areas of the map.  And although random guessing in not required to reach the end, you will need a touch of it for the easter eggs in this game.  So, if it ever feels like you need to rely on random guessing, you really only need to think more creatively.This game is a learning adventure, right from the time you start in the antechamber with the UI and your map to the time you end the game.  You may be able to take some things for granted (and may even become familiar with them), but not everything.  You must learn to think, to look, to visualize, to remember, to unlook, and to unthink.  If you're stuck, there are hints on the walls, both in pictures and in words, which altogether make for a nice little philosophy lesson on the ""where"" of life.Among puzzle games in general, I rank this one right up there with Portal (except Portal's better since it has a more developed game engine, graphics, and storyline, not to mention replay value via custom-made maps and mods)."

These guns allow you to do some fantastic things with the games little cubes, and so the adventure lays itself upon you.The paths will elude you, your perspective on things will be challenged, and you bet the puzzles of this game are as hard as they come. The problem is that the game ""cheats"" you to boost that said difficulty, by purposedly keeping you ignorant of the game's mechanics and its own ""laws of physics"".Truth to be told I could only go so far without help after grabbing the Green Gun, because there is a trick that you must learn to procede (to the Yellow Gun) that is almost impossible to figre out on your own. Seriously. In that point I felt compelled to search for outside help, which broke the experience for me; to add insult to injury, I faced a few others ""obligatory"" puzzles (the game has a very open world structure, in that you can finish it but not see all it's content) with a solution that broke down to the use of a ""hat trick"" that was never, ever teached by the game - I can only assume some people discovered it by accident and the word spreaded.The lack of a more elaborate story is also a negative point, because the developers made such an intriguing maze that the absence of a proper story is felt like a missed opportunity.Overrall, Antichamber is a beautiful, ingenious game, that deserves to be played simply because it is really mentally challenging. It is nowhere near a good experience as Portal, for example, but it was worth the ride."

With its ""story"" conveyed by little tiles on the wall, and its interface never once showing you a menu in a conventional sense, this game managed to be immersive in the face of a massively surreal environment, leading me to feel as though I was actually in this odd place.

This has to be one of the most memorable and creative puzzlers I have played in recent memories. I kind of got obsessed with this game, to that extent that once I played through the whole game, I felt kind of empty inside. Like something's missing, a kind of sad feeling that a great journey now had come to an end, and somehow I'm not sure if I'll ever find a puzzler like this again.I have also played through both the Portal-games, but in my opinion Valve singleplayer games tends to be way to linear where you're always following a set path.

You walk into walls to get guns so you can turn the black box man into an optical illusion.

Though it plays a lot like a First Person Shooter, the object isn't to race through it as quickly as possible and shoot everything in sight; rather, it's appeal lies in the opportunity to explore the world in which you find yourself.  I used to enjoy playing games like Quake, not to blow up monsters, but to try and find all of the secrets and bonuses - this game appeals in the same way.Another thing to note is that, even though the game is advertised as ""breaking all the rules"" as far as gameplay expectations are concerned, the key to solving the game's puzzles is to work out that there actually ARE rules (while the map is definitely non-linear, you can still fidn your way around if you remember how places are connected - and certain symbolic features of the game all work the same way).In short, while Antichamber isn't *truly* a rule-breaker, it *is* a game changer, and a welcome breath of fresh air.  I'd love to see a sequel - if that's possible."

,Recommended,219890,8611238,"Posted: 7 January, 2014",all,Xmus Jaxon Flaxon-Waxon,"Antichamber is a refreshingly fun exploration based puzzle game involving simple mechanics applied to not so simple problems. A majority of the game will be spent using various tools to fiddle with varied and intricate locks made of tiny cubes, more often than not discovering the solutions organically rather than through hints or walkthroughs. The game world is a minimalistic 3D environment that plays with the concept of non-euclidean space ranging from hallways that infinitely loop back on themselves to doors that change destination depending on your perspective.The game is quite imaginative at times, avoiding the pitfalls of a lot of similar puzzle games by not having a lot of arbitrary timed puzzles or gating progress by requiring the solving of one particular puzzle. Antichamber takes a non-linear approach to exploration and this means you often have three or more re-visitable branches to explore at any one time.Don't expect a story though, Antichamber leaves the narrative up to the player, hinting at a deeper meaning through symbolism. The game world is dotted with surprisingly relevant inspirational quotes accompanied by clever little pictures. Collecting all of these soon becomes your measure of completion, even after reaching the pretty spectacular ending level.Admittedly, there are a few puzzles requiring a silly amount of planning but these are few and far between. Most of the time, you can come back to these puzzles at a later time with more knowledge and tools and solve them more easily. That is how non-linear gameplay is supposed to be done; take notes game developers! In addition to some easter-egg rooms, there are even a few bizarrely unfinished areas, hinting that the creator may have had further areas in mind, although there sems to be no real plans to expand the game. Finding these areas is no easy task, and some of the hardest puzzles in the game reside in these places. It's a little sad they didn't get used, even just as an easter egg or something, because they were quite enjoyable and challenging.When it comes down to it, whether or not you will like Antichamber depends on if you are the kind of person who doesn't mind a puzzle game where you are invited to take your time exploring every corner. At worst, Antichamber can be a bit of a confusing labyrinth, but at best it is a forgiving puzzle game with outside-the-box visuals and a great sense of variety."

It loves to mess with your perception above all else, things change and defy logic most of the time.A really cool thing about this game is that every single puzzle translates into some kind of a life lesson or simply motivational quotes. Sometimes the solution will not be hard but will require you do take a different approach, to think outside of the box. Then, the game will re-assess what you did with a little motivational poster that gets put on the wall of the main hub.The game feels very mysterious and you're not given a lot of explanation. This is not a game that you play to finish. It's a game that you play to sit back, relax and think. There is actually a conclusion to the game (that I absolutely loved) although it only really ends once you run out of rooms to explore.The game makes impressive use of the Unreal Engine and the environment constantly reacts in ways that you would not expect. It is filled with impossible rooms and patterns and requires a ton of open-minded thinking. Honestly, it can get a bit overwhelming at times. Sometimes you feel clever for solving the puzzles and sometimes you're just completely lost in how not rational things are, although there is always a very methodic way to solve them.It's also really hard to pick this game back up after not playing for a while. You unlock new mechanics as you progress through the game and not remembering one of them can make solving some puzzles very difficult. Since it's not very long, I would suggest starting over if you haven't played in a while.As a side note, I was slighlty more disappointed with the game's technical side. Options are embedded inside the game, there are no menus, which is very cool on its own... But because of this, I could not set the resolution past 1920x1200, there was no anti-aliasing (and the aliasing is fairly bad in this game) or any other graphical options. I don't think there are any keybind options either (I believe this can be done through the Ini files). I would definitely have liked a bit more of these options.I did not go through all the rooms myself and the game lasted me about 4h30 (played a bit offline so maybe add a few hours to that) for about 75-80% completion. I would expect around 3-4 hours more for 100%. It does feel much, much longer than this however, which is not a bad thing. It's a bit expensive at 22$ for that playtime but honestly, I think it's worth it if this is your kind of game."

It's about learning to think in non-linear paths, about approaching situations in different ways and memorizing and advancing in ways you're not used to. In more ways than one, this game is absolute madness, playing tricks with positioning that no sane mind would be able to memorize.However, in that process, it does offer a whole array of puzzles that make you feel good once you figure them out (okay...most of 'em. There are one or two really frustrating amongst them). The pictures and text feel better than all superfluous ""achievement unlocked""'s combined.The aesthetics may take some getting used to. It's all white, white and more white, but it grows on you. Coupled with the soft music, it really puts your mind at ease.At first, I thought the whole game would be about brain puzzles. And while that was true, the block gun (and variants) do a good job of spicing things up without sacrificing neither the puzzle element nor the atmosphere.I normally take the time to point out some the game's flaws, but in this case it would be a shame. Yes, some puzzles are frustrating, but is it because they ARE frustrating or because it requires the sort of thinking I personally am not accustomed to? It's probably the latter. And I really can't bring myself to criticizing the confusing structure of the whole, as it's that very structure that I come to adore. I mean...how many other games do you know where there's a 7-floor tower, complete with a sort-of-elevator shaft in the middle...where those seven floors are rooms that are located directly next to each other?I just finished it for the second time (first time being a few years ago). As expected, I had sort of forgotten the harder puzzles, making it all the more challenging. And I'll probably replay it again in a few years from now. For puzzle games, that's a pretty unique feat. Take it for what it's worth. If there was a contest for best puzzle game ever, I'd not only nominate this, but criticise everyone who doesn't at least considers it.In summary: best puzzle game ever.

There is no actual story nor narration, only pictures and proverbs suitable for every puzzle solved, yet somehow there is a feeling that you are being guided and all puzzles are leading you to a very certain goal• Graphics are as basic as you can get, everything is made of cubes, amount of polygons is minimal, and there are little to no textures, yet somehow everything is gorgeous and pleasant to look at• Puzzles are inventive, innovative and unique, but all of them has logical solution. It's far from impossible, yet you WILL have to change the way you think more that several times throughout the game. Last (and only) time I was so impressed with game puzzles is when I played Braid.• Game mechanics is just like everything else in this game - simple and awesome. Whole experience reminds of a lot Portal, but not as linear, you actually have several paths to choose from and there are lots of puzzles you can find if you explore the map.What I love the most about mechanics is that you are free to experiment with the game physics and features.

After picking the game up and playing it myself I can firmly say every aspect of the game was very logical in a sort of mad scientist way. If I found myself approaching a puzzle and being confused on what to do, I would go to a different area instead and discover a new game mechanic that I didn't realize I could do. When I would go back to the previous puzzle I was confused about I would have an aha moment and realize that I had the ability all along to solve it. The progression of the game showing you game mechanics was near perfect. I was challenged yet never stuck for too long on any one puzzle. This allowed me to fully enjoy the game without ever needing a wiki. There are still some secrets I need to discover to 100% complete the game, but I was able to reach the ending. If you liked Portal and Portal 2 you will love this game. With that being said this game is far from a Portal clone. All the game mechanics and art style are completely different. To say it is a clone would be to say every platformer is a clone of Mario.

76561198039827748,Recommended,219890,17192840,"Posted: 23 July, 2015",all,sitontheedge,"Antichamber feels like what I imagine Portal would have been if M.C. Escher designed it. The similarities to Portal are obvious: Antichamber is a first-person puzzle-platform game in which a key tool to solving the levels is a kind of gun for manipulating the world. But those similarities are big structural elements, as far as the actual experience of gameplay and the nature of the puzzles Antichamber is unique, and well worth attention in its own right.Antichamber is very abstract; it essentially omits characters and plot altogether. As a player, you are not even told who you are. Instead, you simply find yourself in a world of stark geometric forms from which you are seeking an escape. The system of interconnected rooms and corridors you find yourself in is essentially one big level, without any marked division into stages. But as you discover solution to various puzzles, and gain new tools, more and more areas will become accessible to you. To help with disorientation you may return at any time to a kind of antechamber which provides a map of your progress and also doubles as the game’s only menu.All this sounds rather stark, but the real delight of antechamber is its hard-edged surreality. This is where Escher comes into it. Instead of trying, like most 3D games, to give you the impression that you are in a real, physical space, Antichamber revels in the fact that you aren’t. Instead you are in a world where the geometrically impossible is actual: staircases deposit your back where you started, hallways connect to different places depending on how you use them, doors change where they open to when you turn your back. Relatedly, the game eschews realistic-looking textures for vivid monochrome, including a lot of white.The puzzles also defy expectations. If you’ve played a lot of puzzle games you’ll notice this right away. Unlike many games which tell you what sort of solution you’re looking for and give you a series of puzzles on a common theme, Antichamber leaves you to figure it out for yourself—to wander around and play with the world until you have insight. Some puzzles are of a type players of puzzle platformers will more or less recognize, but others require an entirely different approach, more like lateral thinking. This makes each breakthrough feel like a flash of brilliance. Enigmatic little clues are found on the walls at intervals, some to help you have the needed insight, others just to provide general good advice.All this to say, Antichamber is a great game for the puzzle aficionado, provided she is somewhat patient. Solving this game was really engaging and satisfying. Even after accomplishing your main objective various rooms will, likely, still have something hidden in them. But, also, Antichamber gives you the fun of simply exploring. The place you find yourself is not conventionally beautiful, but it is fascinating, and much has been included simply to fascinate. Among other things, there are several hidden rooms in antechamber which preserve artifacts from its development, and others where it seems the level designers are simply showing off what they can do with the faux physics of their world. Antichamber provides you with a digital artifact worth simply looking at.There are a few downsides to this. That you are not restricted to working on a single, clearly delineated problem is both a blessing and a curse. Being dropped into this labyrinth without much direction, unsure where to even start looking for solutions, can seem daunting. There were points in my first play through where I had to just put the game down to come back to later, and others where I spent a lot of time on challenges that turned out not to really advance me (for instance because I’d been trying to access a point which was meant to be easily reachable much later in the game). Also, this would be a poor choice for somebody not already familiar with this sort of videogame. This is a puzzle game for gamers.But, overall, I’d rate this as one of the very best puzzle platformers I’ve played, in a category with things like Braid and Portal. It is well worth a look."

This game has no story, and a very simplistic visuals. Audio does add to the atmosphere though. The game begins with extremely easy tasks, but the difficulty slowly raises the further you go. What surprised me is that this is not a portal clone at all, whatever screenshots suggest, but it's a puzzle game nonetheless, and the chaces are that if you enjoyed Portal, then you will also enjoy Antichamber. To every puzzle you encounter there is a hint provided. Hints are philosophical reflections, which also give solutions to puzzles - but they are not straightforward and require some logical thinking (you may figure out every puzzle the first time without trial & error style of play - which was the case in Portal too many a time - but as the puzzles become more and more complex you will finally encounter ones that are too difficult for that, unless you are smarter than the developer or me at least). Fortunately, the philosophical reflections are not of 2deep4u kind, so you are not constantly molested with ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ stuff. They are very simple and kind of cute. It's like the guy who made this game wasn't a typical recluse indie developer suffering from affective disorders and egocentrism, but actually a reasonable and smart dude. The gameworld consist of multiple corridors, which branch in many ways and it's the player who chooses which way he prefers to go (or rather - how he solves puzzles, because they often have multiple solutions). At any time you may come back to any previously encountered puzzle and solve it again, perhaps in a different way leading you to another branch of the ""chamber"".Overall, I enjoy this game a lot, despite my inner prejudice towards puzzle and adventure games."

Very similar to Portal in its presentation (a basic white 'testing' environment), however - game play mechanics are a bit different.  The best description I've found is a cross between Portal and Minecraft. Each new puzzle 'room' forces you to re evaluate what is being presented versus what is possible, forcing you to constantly re-analyze your possibilities. Walkthroughs are not recommended, just patience - as leaving the game to come back with fresh eyes is the BEST way to overcome that obstacle, and reap the benefits of being proud at your own abilities. Sound FX are good and interesting, providing environmental specific background noise, but it is not intrusive. There are no themes to sing along with, no dialogue to pay attention to. In the end, the audio sets a relaxing, unobtrusive mood, and nothing more. Graphics are simple, yet refined. Due to the amount of individual 3d 'objects' you can have in the game at once - perhaps a simple graphic presentation is by design. It took a while, but with some effort, Ii WAS able to eventually crash the game by spawning enough objects to overwhelm my video abilities. Lots of enjoyment for any puzzle enthusiast.

My decision was made based on what little gameplay I'd seen in trailers and my tendency to prefer games that think outside the box.  In that regard, Antichamber did not let me down.When I went into the game I was fully expecting not only Escher-like rooms, but also Escher-like physics.  The mechanics of the game are often unexpected and unexplained, which I sometimes found annoying, but also easy to rectify.  The draw for me as I got deeper into the game was the overarching philosophy, which I will leave unexplained so as not to spoil the game.The game is not without its drawbacks, however minor they may be.  There is a significant amount of backtracking, because it is fairly likely you'll need one upgrade or another to discover all the secrets in a particular area, and sometimes in a particular room.  The game compensates by utilizing a very good map system which keeps track not only of which rooms you've completed and which you haven't, but also of which room you were last in before warping back to the main hub, which room you started in the last time you warped out, and what path you took to get there.  The developer was fully aware that the physics in the game allowed for various paths per room, and took the necessary measures to facilitate exploration of each path.The main issue I took with this game is an unresolvable problem with the game's settings.  There is no way to change settings for FOV and other visual options.  In most games I've played, this is more an annoyance than a serious issue, but in Antichamber, I could not play for extended periods of time without experiencing serious motion sickness.  This was more of an issue in the beginning of the game, as I was getting used to the mechanics and exploring every room to its full extent, rather than focusing on a specific puzzle, but it meant that I could only play the game for periods of 1-2 hours at at time before I had to take a break for the day.Because of the motion issues, I almost gave up after my first several hours playing the game.  However, I decided to give it another chance because I enjoyed what I had played and wanted to see more.  The hand-drawn graphic style is a nice change of pace from most other first-person puzzle games out there, and the minimalist, ambient soundtrack does a nice job of drawing you in to the otherwise alienating atmosphere.  If you can get past the issues presented by the significantly limited options and settings, do try to beat the game.  The ending sequence and significance presented within are nicely worth the effort."

While I'm far from considering myself a ""classic gamer"", one thing I find a bit exasperating about almost all modern games is how they will persistently hold your hand in a manner that, even if it doesn’t remove the challenge entirely, certainly does a lot to insult your intelligence. You will not run into this problem in Antichamber, and this for me is its main charm. Much like the very first Legend of Zelda game, AC starts you out in an unknown, unexplained world and you have to learn the rules by yourself, some writing on the walls telling you how to control your newfound matter gun (which I didn't even find until maybe 2 hours in playing the game and honestly completely forgot about until I did) and upgrades the only real guides you'll be getting, aside from some delightful life lessons you only receive after completing the puzzles they refer to. The simple puzzles quickly become daunting and brain-teasing, though a small few can become a bit tedious (and one puzzle in particular, albeit optional and only leading to an extra dev room, is complete and utter BS). However, for the most part the game has an excellent track record of keeping your mind stimulated and providing many rewarding and even cathartic moments, and many puzzles are an absolute joy for me to replay over and over again.I also love the game’s minimalist presentation. You’ll be spending a lot of your time in pure white hallways, frequently visiting rooms that sport a color scheme ripped out of an MS Paint palette, but the game finds ways to use even its graphic simplicity to its advantage (many of the game’s puzzles and tricks wouldn’t work too well, I don’t think, in a more detailed aesthetic). I’ve seen people refer to the game as “ugly”, and while it certainly isn’t too easy on the eyes, it still finds ways to look just as charming as it plays.At a glance, the game could easily be describled as ""Portal with blocks” (even though development on this game started a year before Portal was released), but what sets it apart from its mad scientist peer more than anything is while Portal follows a very linear storyline, AC is completely open, nonlinear, and ready and waiting to have every conceivable corner explored—as soon as you figure out your way around. Another important difference that makes AC stand on its own is that where Portal’s theme is based around physics, science and strict logic, AC’s theme is its complete and utter deconstruction of your preconceptions of logic and reality, and while logic isn’t necessarily completely absent from the game, it has created its own, new set of rules that, again, you have to figure out for yourself.This game did have me stumped on more than a few occasions and I will admit have committed the sin of using a walkthrough to help me through a few of them (although all but one of them ended up being dev rooms), but after seeing the answers its clear that a player’s inability to proceed really does simply stem from their lack of ability to put pieces together rather than a negligence of giving you all the tools you need and teaching you how to use them—there are plenty of subtle, clever lessons leading up to larger problems, but it’s up to you to actually learn them and keep them in your head.Overall, I’d say my only big complaint with Antichamber is that there isn’t more of it. There’s no real extra content aside from the hidden dev rooms, and apart from restarting your save file to finish with a faster time there isn’t exactly much in the way of replay value, and asking for a sequel to a game like this in my opinion would be outrageous. Still, if Bruce does come up with something, I’d love to see it and will be the first in line to get it. :) This game is without a doubt one of the finest I’ve played and is an absolute must-have for puzzle game enthusiasts."

The puzzles are often hard but always logical within the rules that antichamber lays out (so far at least).The introduction of new concepts is well paced. The only thing I'm not sure I like is the fact that you'll encounter plenty of puzzles that cannot be solved until you revist them later with a new manipulation tool. There are positives to that approach but I also think it leads to a lot of confusion and frustration that could easilly put someone off.Overall, I highly recommend this.

I enetered this game expecting it to be akin to Portal, and while it was in some senses, they are two entirely different experiences. Portal gets you to think with...portals, and Antichamber just simply requires you to think outside the box. While it is a simple concept, some of the challenges can prove to be quite difficult.I really cant find many problems with this game. The only thing that comes to mind is that sometimes the  game can  double up on the solution to puzzles. This is quite noticable around midway through the game, when around 2-3 of the puzzles have the same solution. That being said, the sheer uniqueness of some of the other puzzles more than make up for this.Some may find that the game isn't extremely replayable. However, for me this wasn't too much of a problem, and I thoroughly enjoyed the game even on my second playthrough.Overall, amazing game, an extremely unique game to the genre, and a must-buy during sales.9/10"

And if this opening statement sounds enticing albeit annoyingly vague and unhelpful, then it resonates with the philosophy of Antichamber - where almost nothing is as it seems at first glance. Its deceivingly plain aesthetics conceal a devious challenge that may intrigue the casual onlooker for a short time, but which can only be fully conquered through no small amounts of exploration and experimentation. Sometimes you'll get a glimpse of the cogs turning inside the machine as you follow a certain path and earn your access to an entirely optional area. Oftentimes you'll be stumped, and forced to backtrack and consider a different approach. The fascination of Antichamber is in the mystery of its workings. It's a test of your curiosity, cunning, and perhaps most of all your ability to experience the unforeseen and learn from that experience. In the words of Samuel Beckett: ""Ever tried. Ever failed. No matter. Try Again. Fail again. Fail better.""Antichamber may confuse or even frustrate you, but it's never disappointing. It's a mesmerizing, intricate gem of a game."

You find yourself in an unsettling world with laws you don't understand.  As you progress, you think you are gaining understanding...but perhaps the only understanding is the journey itself. The ending blew my mind!  It's open for interpretation, though, so be sure to pay attention to all the symbolism as you are going through the game or else you might not have the tools to interpret it satisfactorily for yourself.I've discovered at least four easter eggs so far, and I know there are several left.

It doesn't explain its mechanics or even announce that any problem exists. There is no hand holding or even an introduction. Instead, it simply opens a door and invites you to pass through.The entire game is a grand puzzle where the goal is not only to find the correct answers, but to actually figure out how the world works. It doesn't just force you to think outside the box, it makes you question if the box was ever there to begin with.Antichamber assumes a lifetime of experience driving what you come to expect from a 3D environment, and works to break all those preconceptions. Its mechanics straddle the line between the third and fourth dimensions, giving the game its inviting appearance while still affording it license to blow your mind at will.This does not, however, mean that the game is unfair. Although Antichamber continually seeks to warp reality, it does so in a very consistent manner. The world, which may seem obtuse at first, is in fact, incredibly structured and rigidly built, though this may only become apparent once you've drawn back the curtain yourself.While this does mean that you can really only play Antichamber once, for that one playthrough, it becomes more than just a puzzle game, it truly makes you feel like you're learning to walk all over again."

Forget everything you ever learned in puzzle games. Trust nothing. Not what you see... not what you hear. Take nothing for granted.

It is deep, engrossing, challenging, and absolutely mind blowing. Walls vanish when you try to walk through them... floors appear when you try to walk over them... and sometimes and endless loop isn't quite so endless at all. Perspective is everything in this game, and looking at the same thing from a different view can render completely unexpected results. Nothing is impossible in this strange yet beautiful world.

But a clear or comprehensible storyline is essentially non-existent in this game. However, this is by no means a shortcoming of the game; rather it allows the player to use their imagination to determine what is actually happening while keeping the focus on what it should be focussing on, that is the gameplay and puzzles.The puzzles themselves started out fairly simple while you begin to take in and understand exactly what you have to do in this antichamber into which you've been thrusted. This point of the game I personally found a little tedious as there is quite a bit of wandering to do amongst the seemingly endless chambers. However, once you find the cube gun (I don't know what it is actually called, but hey) the game becomes much more linear and allows you to explore your new tool's full capabilities, which leads to some fairly interesting results. In addition to this, the pacing is excellent in that the difficulty increases proportionately to the amount you know about how to fully utilise the gun. This is coupled with little life lessons that appear before and/or after completion of a puzzle that perfectly describe the impending problem or its solution. I really liked this addition as it is kind of like your own little pocket Confucious that could help you solve real-world problems if you can find the appropriate connections and parallels. While the puzzles aren't the most difficult I've ever done, they are certainly the ones most capable of ... ahem ... BLOWING YOUR MIND.With that note I move onto the aspect I enjoyed the most, the graphics. The game uses a limited colour palette, with most rooms being white with black borders. However this makes the use of colour that much more effective as it can go from bland to completely vibrant in a couple of seconds, completely changing the mood and re-energising the player. This is definitely one of the strong points of the game as it really makes the entire experience feel surreal, as if you really are in a non-existent room, outside of time and space, a chamber that isn't really a chamber: an Antichamber (Dun dun DUUUN)Aside from this, I will admit that I found the controls a little imprecise at times which led to some minor drawbacks, but overall this is my only other complaint with the game. It is by no means perfect, nor is it high on my list of amazing games, but I definitely enjoyed the short time I spent playing this game and wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone fond of puzzles."

But if you do, you won't get confused but solve some rooms rather fast. However, lot of patience is required and you might even become stuck. In those cases I recommend returning to the game after a few days and trying again in a new way. (If you become desperate, drink a few beers and you will move on :D). To sum up, I really recommend this to anyone who likes to think and explore, the game is challenging and fun. Finished in 11 hours, I really feel clever :) 9/10"

Let's just say that i saw an video of the game and got confused, then i decided to play the game. Until that point, it was understandable, my life made sense, people around me made sense. That, of course, before i actually played the game.At the very beginning i started to get a little confused, it seemed that the game was trying to make me as a fool, and tried to hide that with metaphores. 5 minutes of gameplay i started to be amazed, i started to understand the game mechanics and i felt the game was starting to like me. Was it? No. After 20 minutes i went a little crazy, i stopped paying attention to everything that was not on my screen, the more i played, more the game started to ressemble an human mind, like when you are thinking about something important and you feel like your own mind is trying to debate with you. The whole game was like that, i felt i was inside some confused mind, when things started to make sense, something extremely confusing decided to happen. 2 hours of gameplay and i was lost, completely lost. Not in the game scenario, no. But in my mind, there were a few moments that i forgot important things, like my name or shoe size.I don't think any game made me feel that confused and impressed at the same time, not ""Stanley Parable"" Hilarious confusion, not a ""Inception"" confusion, but some sadistic, psicodelic, ""hungry"" and creative confusion. Now you ask me: ""That seen terrible!"" and i will answer to you: ""That's not a question!"". Completely amazing."

I suggest you give it a try if you like a game that challenges your brain. And maybe also ones that challenge your patience a bit. But mostly your brain. It was a fun experience. I would do it again if I could forget all the puzzles. And I don't say that often about puzzle games. I hold them to a damn high standard.I would say worth 10$.

Probably not, best just do both. Sure, the graphics style is a bit annoying and hurting on the eyes sometimes but you get used to it. The game is mostly based around placing blocks in positions using your magic block gun to complete puzzles (most having multiple ways to complete), gaining new mechanics to the gun as the game progresses effectively unlocking new areas that previously confused the hell out of you.

,Recommended,219890,11092320,"Posted: 5 July, 2014",all,TheColorUrple,"Any first person puzzle game situated in colorful, abstract environments that promises to bend your mind is instantly appealing to me. Antichamber won't be a game I'll have to sell to anyone - it knows its audience. I'm more interested in explaining why it's less successful than I had hoped, and why, nearly a year after my feverish desire to start it, I have only just picked it back up and finished it.Antichamber is a game best enjoyed on a calm night with a cold beer. Progress may or may not happen in any given session, and there is a distinct possibility that you'll just wander around in circles for an hour and give up. This isn't because you're obtuse, but because Antichamber partakes in very little handholding, and the speed of your success is largely going to depend on your grasping some of the game's fundamental mechanics, which you'll need to discover mostly on your own.The highest praise I can offer about the experience is how satisfying it is towards the last couple of hours. Antichamber relishes in teaching you concepts and mechanics throughout its entire length, and while I'm not a big fan of how it's set up (more below), in the end you'll feel like you've conquered one big puzzle chamber, rather than just a series of its constituent parts. The payoff is a really cool ending sequence that is mostly worth the effort to experience.Antichamber's environment is one large interconnected labyrinth. (Large in the $20 indie game sense, which means fairly small, equating roughly to the size of the original Portal.) Its passages and puzzle rooms loop into each other in an abstract way. Any area can lead instantly to any other, and while this sounds good in theory, as you advance and discover new rooms, it's progressively harder to remember and understand how exactly to get back to a previous area you want to go to. Oftentimes, it's literally impossible. The game alleviates some of that frustration by allowing you to access the game's hub room with the Esc key, which features a map of the entire labyrinth and all its rooms, each of which you can instantly link to. The map itself is close to useless for typical navigation, since in this game, rooms can connect in ways that can't be depicted in two or even three dimensions.The problem with this approach is that it breaks the flow and immersion of the game, since you come to realize that backtracking (and forwardstracking, I guess) through the puzzle rooms is largely inefficient compared to immediate access of any given puzzle. It winds up being largely inconsequential how all the rooms connect, since there's no real way to understand Antichamber as a whole structure. The only way to grasp it is by viewing each room as an island - it doesn't matter how it connects to the others, since each room's puzzle is an isolated affair and can be accessed with a simple click of the mouse on the map.Early on in the game, you start to run into unsolvable puzzles that you may or may not understand are initially unsolvable until you tinker unsuccessfully with them for a while. This is because your only tool is a gun that absorbs and shoots little cubes that you need to interact with in various ways, and while you (again) may not realize this at first, the gun itself has hidden upgrades that make said cubes act differently. It becomes a Metroidvania style of exploration - running very frequently into inaccessible areas you'll have to take note of to try again later when you've failed to figure them out.Oftentimes you will solve a puzzle in Antichamber, only to have the exit lead to a place you've already been. In other instances, working on a solution will lead you to a secret room that has no exit or reason for existing, or again to an elusive ""pink cube"" that (spoiler) serves absolutely no purpose in the game. The game's exit itself can be accessed before a good portion of the game is even solved, rendering the whole thing a bit inconsequential in my mind. There's no justification to much of the game's environments, and this is where a bit of linear design would have helped. I can hear the counterargument, the idea that a good labyrinth will have a plethora of dead ends and red herrings, but ultimately a sense of concrete progress can be hard to feel, robbing you of much of that satisfaction inherent to solving puzzles.There are various panels scattered throughout the labyrinth that can be activated to display an image and some text. Finding every one of these panels (a feat kept track of in the hub room) is this game's version of completion, and once you figure out how to interpret the map (it's not obvious), you can busy yourself in the endgame by revisiting all the incomplete puzzle rooms to search for those last missing panels. It's just enough to get you to explore the entire labyrinth front-to-back, yet the rewards for finding the game's secrets just aren't that interesting - rooms filled with concept art, 3D model museums, and other frivolous filler. Some sort of overall reward for finding all the secrets, like maybe a bonus ending or extra challenging puzzle sequence, would have been better.What's unique in Antichamber, yet falls a bit flat in my opinion, is that your Cube Shooter is the main puzzle of the game. The behavior of the cubes you absorb from and shoot back into the environment follow a set of specific rules that are not always explained. These rules form the bulk of Antichamber's challenge, and to be quite honest, the rules aren't very logical. You have to interact and tinker enough to figure the rule sets out, but it's entirely possible to solve a puzzle accidentally without comprehension of the rule in play, or even solve one in a way the developer did not intend. With a limited set of tools, you can break the game several times and access areas too early if you're clever enough.So with regards to the gun/cube manipulation, I never found myself in that wonderful ""AHA!"" moment when comprehension suddenly dawned on me - I was always a bit behind what the developer was hoping I would understand, and I was getting through the game in such a way that I wasn't even sure if it was actually CORRECT. Having completed the entire game and having found all of its chambers and panels (resorting to a guide in only one instance), I am still unsure of precisely how a few of the cube mechanics work, and that's not saying anything good about the principal gameplay factor.And honestly, all of this comes by choice of design, I think. The developer was probably aiming for a nonlinear puzzle game that offered numerous possibilities of solutions and ways through. In this sense, the developer succeeded. It was just a less satisfying approach than I would have hoped.I'm still recommending the game though since it did a lot of things right. The visual style is interesting, with its mostly sparse environments accented with flourishes of color. I think this game is about life and death, so while the environments are very rigid in architecture, the sound design is intentionally organic, often evoking outdoor environments and weather phenomena. The music is perfectly ambiant, and some of the puzzles are genuinely exceptional.It's an easy recommendation for fans of the genre, and while my overall impression is definitely positive, there were times it just left me a bit cold."

No spoilers of course.Antichamber is a puzzle game unlike literally anything you've ever known. It's got the same 'how did I not get that, I'm so dumb' feeling as Portal/Portal 2, but also has the feel of the Stanley Parable. Like the Stanley Parable, the secret of Antichamber isn't what happens, but the underlying meaning and denseness of what's going on. It's hard to explain, but that's what it's like.The Good:Antichamber is something just fantastically mental. While it has the just puzzle elements of other games like Portal, the rest of it depends on your understanding of what the bloody hell is going on. The messing of perspective and non-euclidian nature of shapes and things is totally new and bonkers. Also it looks very nice too. While not particularly graphically exiting, it does have a nice colour scheme, base white with other colours painted onto it. And the exploration of the one HUGE  level (No loading screens!) and manipulation of 'stuff' with your four guns opens possibilities. Sometimes to go fowards, you have to backtrack, get something and try again.The Bad:The puzzles can certainly be very weak. After obtaining the guns, rather than being perspective neural nightmares, they just become block puzzles. Some can be very, very difficult, so you'll either wonder around aimlessly for while for something to do, or just google the answer. And also it doesn't support some resolutions, like 1600x900. Finally, I would say for £15, I think it's a little overpriced. Maybe £10 pounds would be more reasonable.The Verdict:If you just want something new and ingenious, just buy it. While you may forget it after you get stuck on one puzzle for 1000 years, the 999 years beforehand will most likely be fantastically bonkers."

It's incredibly (even absurdly) minimalist. It's a fascinating example of what happens if you say ""what can I do without?"". Everything not absolutely necessary to the game has been whittled away; even textures. What you're left with is an experience that's an absolute distillation of a vision.It's one of my top ten games. Some of the puzzles are super hard and stump me even on the fourth playthrough, but the game is so well structured that you don't end up banging your head against a single thing with nowhere else to go; if you get stuck on one thing you can always go do something else. It's mercilessley logical, though the logic is often nearly impossible to understand, and the satisfaction of figuring out a tough puzzle is immensely gratifying."

With a very steep learning curve, it's definitely a smart game made for smart gamers. The minimalist soundtrack of natural sounds, from bird calls to the crackling of a fireplace, really lulled me into a sense of immersion, curiosity and peacefulness. The art style of Antichamber starkly contrasts the hyperrealism of blockbuster games like Call of Duty: environments are sparse, with deliberate use of color and contours, but very little detail. Furthermore, the few visual cues available serve as hints or teach new game mechanics, even if their meaning is ambiguous at first. What I enjoyed most about Antichamber, after reading several interviews with developer Alexander Bruce, is that the game serves as an allegory for life's vicissitudes - sometimes you're up, and other times, you're down. The cartoon plaques in each of the game's rooms are captioned with pithy quotes (e.g. failing to succeed does not mean failing to progress) that serve not only advise the player about how to solve each puzzle, but also how live more gracefully. A must-play for gamers seeking a cerebral, but rewarding challenge."

However, 'Antichamber' felt like a barrage of puzzles, with barely any moment for players to soak in the moments -- similar to trying to get out an escape room before the timer runs out.While I do recommend 'Antichamber', I cannot say I am highly entertained by it. If you enjoy solving puzzles for the sake of solving puzzles, I think this game is for you.

Now although this game is really cool and different, in my opinion it’s a hard one to give either a thumbs up or down and I’ll explain from my experience why.Ok so the options menu...abysmal is probably a good way to describe it. You can't rebind keys without configuring files and there are only 3 mouse sensitivity options.About 2 hours into the game I had to look at a walkthrough and I don't know if I missed some fundamental lesson/room that would have helped me but when I watched what to do I couldn't understand how you could have possibly worked it out (I'm trying not to spoil anything). Anyways, once I understood this new thing I progressed and finished the game (getting stuck fairly often which is good).Another thing, I've heard people feeling nauseous while playing this game, and although I didn't have it that bad I did have some problems. After playing this game and leaving my computer my eyes/vision wasn't right; I couldn’t properly concentrate on things and it took an hour or so to recover. So I’d recommend taking very regular breaks when playing this.However, the puzzles in this game are so cool. The rooms can change around you and a solution might not be immediately obvious which means you need to think outside the box. Certainly the most mind bending puzzle game I’ve played.So, a very cool game, on the expensive side.

The overwhelming majority of problems have almost no vertical thinking component to them (there are a few mild exceptions to this), and this isn't at all a bad thing - this means that if you can't solve a particular puzzle, you are generally missing a foundational understanding of a particular concept. Oftentimes there are intermediate puzzles that you don't at all have to solve if you have learned a concept in order to be able to bypass them completely - but they are still there in order to be able to figure it out the first time.I find the ambient soundtrack to be very effective and immersive.The biggest negative for this game is that it's $20 for a 5-15 hour game.

I compare this to portal for reasons that i will go into later, but it really is a good comparison. Antichamber is a game ment to be experienced as blind as possible, so you can feel that satisfying feeling of self-loathing when you look up the answer to one of the puzzles. The game is all about learning the rules and applying them in as meny ways as you can imagine.And here in lies the justification for the portal reference. You have a lot of freedom in this game. I'm not talking about sandbox-like games where you have a large play pen to be in. In portal, you could put the portals any way you liked, even if it wasn't relevent to the puzzle. Of course you couldn't portal every surface, but the game never felt the need to take away the functionality of the gun with some scripted sequence (for example, when Samus losing some weapons because her armor was damaged in a cut scene). You also had time to complete puzzles. You didn't feel rushed (until the climax of course), and you weren't punished for your failures as you would be in other games (no lost progress, xp loss, or money loss).Antichamber puts you in an enviornment and says, ""Go Nuts"" without telling you what to do. Gradually you will learn the rule set, and understand what you need to gather to progress. It's a tad annoying in that respect, (similar to rogue-like games that refuse to tell you what the items in game do) but not unreasonable. Careful observation and random chance will have you discovering new things that will help you progress. As you get the guns, you can really start to screw with the game and do some really neat stuff.Antichamber is a great experience, and definitly a situational pick-up. If you love puzzlers, it can be a lot of fun; if you want story, go elsewhere; and if you want solid mechanics, you will be held over but not blown away. Just keep in mind that this game is deep, making you think as opposed to making you ask questions. The goal isn't to give a message like, ""War never changes"", but rather to change your way of thinking. It does a great job at that. It gave me a headache like every classic piece book i've ever read, but had me walking away with something more then just wasted time and a happy disposition. Pick this up if you want some brain food.Also-- One piece of advice, the map tells you a lot... if you're stuck, go to rooms you haven't been in, using the map as a reference as to where they might be."

I often complain about games that are too hand holdy, but I felt that Antichamber was too far on the opposite end of the scale, giving almost no indication of what I was supposed to be doing. The non linear progression didnt help, because I was often unsure if I was supposed to solve a particular puzzle now or come back later with new equipment.

,Recommended,219890,29956242,Posted: 15 February,all,Neuronwake,"Antichamber is a good puzzler that starts with simple mechanics and slowly builds them out to make complex challenges as it progresses to the end.In Antichamber, you work your way through a convoluted collection of hallways, high jumps, and locked doors using relatively easy-to-grasp abilities in a deep variety of challenges. As you go along, you'll unlock a few new tools that are worked well (for the most part) into the later puzzles. You'll also find plaques that offer tiny philisophical quips that double as slightly veiled hints to solving each puzzle.The levels have a good air of mystery and otherworldliness to them. They turn in on themselves with architecture based off of an M.C. Escher sketch. However, even though this fits the mind-bending theme of the game, I must admit that the complex nature of the hallways, elevators, and portals can sometimes lead to you not knowing where to go next for a new set of puzzles. After you clear a major portion of a level, there are arrows that indicate where you should go, but they are easy to lose in the strange geometry of the map.Also, there was one point of the game where I was stuck thinking that I couldn't pass a puzzle without a new tool unlocked somewhere else. Turns out, I could solve it with what I had -- only, it was using an ability I didn't even know I had gained. It was the only point in the game that that happened, but it left a bad taste in my mouth.All in all, I did enjoy the final set of puzzles, which were made up of a review of past puzzles with new approaches thrown in. While not a particularly long game, it was enjoyable for almost all of its run."

,Recommended,219890,29387047,Posted: 20 January,all,TheAngelOfRoses,"First off I just want to say: Wow, this game is amazing.My Basic Overview:Lets get down to it, this game is a first person puzzle game that focuses around a ""Gun"" that shoots and picks up cubes or messes with them in particularly interesting ways. Using this you go through a series of chambers and puzzles that on a scale of 1x1x1 Rubiks Cube to 92 Thousand Piece Puzzle of a white picture lies around the range of ""Do-able, but it will mess with your mind pretty hard""For a game that has such a simple mechanical design on solving puzzles I'm rather impressed on the vareity of ways it was implimented and actually provided an awesome challenge that a puzzle enthusiast like me greatly enjoyed. Even If I have beaten the game its still doesnt mean I've found every nook and cranny of the game and there's penty more to do.Breaking it down a bit:This game is best enjoyed going into it 100% blind and not knowing what to do, it gives a sense of wonder and curiosity as you try to rip apart this game, however, sometimes it seems the game is 3 steps ahead of you and sometimes things dont make sense at all, but rest assured, you dont have to make sense of everything to beat the game. Plus there are more than just one path to solving a puzzle, I'm about 99% sure i totally cheesed or broke some kind of rule while playing this game and beating the puzzles, and the fact it allows these methods that seem horribly unorthodox is a testament to the fact you can think so far out the box you're half way to the edge of the universe yet the plan can still work if you're clever enough.As mentioned before the game relys around a simple principal of using cubes that you can move around and place to solve various puzzles, be it hold open doors, activate switches, or use them as means of mobility. While completely simple the extra mechanics that come with this concept make it incredibly fun (and frustrating) to use and the game will gladly explain new mechanics as you stumble upon them, and if you dont know how to do it, then you're not ready to do so yet which adds an interesting sense of flow that can result in you feeling like you hit a dead end, but just keep one peice of advice in your mind when you play this game:Not everything is how it seems, and rules of logic are both flimsy and unstable in this game, so try EVERYTHING you can think ofDifficulty:This game may legit be difficult to the extent where it can turn some people away from it. So lets get this clear: If you're someone who doesnt like a challenge or something that forces you to break logic, then this game may not be for you. It can be difficult, and you have to be willing to go to extreme lengths and leaps of logic to complete various tasks, however the majority of puzzles I completed all at least had a solution that after I figured them outMade a ton of sense AFTER i figured them out. Some however made no sense at all, and its ok because thats what this game is about.Gamplay:The way this game is handled compared to others is what makes this my favorite puzzle game to exist. The point of this game and its playstyle is to essentially make you feel uncomfortable or dumbfounded at times. It will without a doubt no matter who you are make you go ""Well I didnt expect that"" or ""Whoah!"" at some given point in time. If not from the puzzles, then from the visuals. The game has a very minimalistic underlying design but the world you travel around in is so intense it makes up for everything.Final Thoughts:While this Review may seem kind of repetitve and simple, it was that way for a reason, I did not want to post any spoilers about the game or much information about it at all. This game gains immense amounts of value from just learning on your own and going in blind. So if you like puzzles and your mind being messed with. Play this game. You will never regret it."

Calling it a puzzle game feels misleading, It doesn't merely *contain* puzzles; the entire game is the puzzle, and a viscous one at that.After throwing you headlong into a bizarre and confusing environment to explore, the game gradually introduces you to new concepts and mechanics. However, it never shies away from introducing you to puzzles, gates, and dead-ends that you are not yet prepared or equipped to solve. Part of the game is learning how to overcome these obstacles. Another part is simply remembering where those obstacles are -- and how to return to them -- once you have the means to overcome them.Antichamber is one of the most enjoyably maddening games ever. You will be stumped and confused. The game expects and wants you to be stumped and confused, and will do almost nothing to help you.

Antichamber respects the players mind and their heart, and the more I played it the more I felt I came to know Alex and the way he thinks and feels, through the game.

,Recommended,219890,519327,"Posted: 21 September, 2013",all,Bunni,"By FAR one of the best puzzle games I have ever played. I would highly, highly recommend this game. At first glance a lot of the puzzles appear to be cheep tricks but they grow to be rather fun and most importantly, intellectually stimulating (what puzzle games are supposed to do).One of my favorite aspects of this game is that the puzzles can be solved in a plethora of ways. Where as in most puzzle games, each puzzle only has one solution: the developers intended solution. Which may be quite obscure and therefore difficult to disconcern (which DOES NOT make for a good puzzle game).Here however, there are many ways to solve a puzzle here and the skills you learn along the way are being constantly tested and reapplied in a perfect balance that neither sees intense reptition (of practicing skills) nore far reaches (i.e. learning algebra I then being expecting to jump straight into calculus).Futhermore, theres a very limited factor of aggravation- most puzzle games like to have a few puzzles that require you to do something very precise within a very limited window and when you fail, require you do to the whole puzzle over again. While there is SOME of that here, the amount that you have to redo is significantly shorter than most other puzzle games (as youll see when you learn to properly wield the transport system).My ONLY complaint about this game is that you need a pair of sunglasses to play it, really guys, turn down the brightness which you cannot do in game. The options you can configure in game are quite limited (mostly resolution), you have to go into the config files to manually rebind keys and lower the intense brightness (EVERYTHING is vibrant, VIBRANT colors, usually pure white).While not being stone set linear like most puzzle games, there are multiple paths to take especially if you cannot figure out a particular puzzle, but ultimately you have to have completed a central goal (the weapon portrayed in some of the SS's) to progress on to additional paths. So its not entirely free lance- carve your own path but, its close. As such It has very limited replayability, especially as most of the puzzles revolve around learning a central key hidden method (quite satisfying when you find them on your own).Now its not the mind f*** that all the reviewers claim it to be. However its very fun to explore, and can be sort hard to follow spacially, but you'll get it rather quick off the bat.I *HIGHLY* recommend this for puzzle game lovers."

Hmmm...The game isn't that long, I finished it in around 13 hours, with my fair share of physically headbanging walls around the house wondering what I was missing in a certain area. But just like beating a new boss in Dark Souls, figuring out a challenging puzzle would fill me with joy and carry me to the next one. Plus, the messages, be it in the form of drawings or texts, kept me curious and engaged."

This game you acually have to think hard and figure out what to do next. You have to go through some freaking awesome puzzles. Plus, you get a gun, that shoots blocks, and the further you get through the game the better the gun gets. Sounds crazy but it's pretty cool.I really reccomend this game if you like games like Portal or if you like to be confused. You can go one direction and decide to turn around, but once you turn around you're in a completely different place. You can start over and even try a speed run, or maybe you missed a few signs and need to go look for them.

It can be confusing at times but I think that if you poke around long enough, you will notice patterns in the first apparent madness of getting your mind messed with. This game is non-linear by the way.The worst I have experienced was doing things the hard way. It bit me in the butt later. Mid way through my playthrough trying to find all areas, I was struggling to grasp what to do next. That was all fixed once I obtainedthe yellow gun and shortly after the red gun (best gun, no down side). That made things easier than what I was attempting to do.Overall, worth the time to play. This game didn't mess with me as much as I thought it would, primarily because I am very used to the concept of ""world portals"" (look it up, real entity of Portal 2) from map makers from the Portal 2 Workshop thinking they are being clever or funny with it when really they are just wasting my time, being annoying with it, and trying to confuse me. This game knows how to do such a concept right."

Antichamber is a pure 3-dimensional puzzle platform shooter in the vein of Portal or.... well, Portal 2.The graphic style is very spartan, yet effective and delivers a very peculiar atmosphere. Especially contrasted with the ambience sound that directly contradicts what you see and subsequently evokes a very surreal overall picture.The puzzles are very diverse and get successively more difficult as you explore the labyrinth of rooms and corridors, all while the progression is quite naturally regulated by the growing abilities you gain to interact with the environment - though it is sometimes not really obvious if you can already solve a puzzle or not, which can frustrate, but more often than not you have rooms and paths to explore, when you cannot solve a puzzle yet.Not directly visible, but also really interesting and engaging is the story of Alexander Bruce, the sole creator of Antichamber (safe for some assets, such as sounds). This work and piece of art was a cathartic episode of his life, struggling with the construction of this game and life in general. And it becomes apparent once you realise that the whole game revolves around finding ways, overcoming obstacles and struggling with the environment to reach an aim you cannot even see, nor grasp its meaning. With this in mind, Antichamber becomes almost profund - yet most likely for no one as much as for its creator.Rating: Highly recommendable! (As a game, as well as a statement!)"

On the one hand, it's a Metroidvania in non-Euclidean space, deliberately and often deliciously confusing to navigate. On the other, it’s a surprisingly traditional puzzle game with some great ideas, but also some extremely clumsy mechanics. Those two things rarely intersect; while there are puzzles that utilise all the freaky geometry, most of them do not, which seems a shame. If anything, the game feels a bit too easy considering the brain-melting potential it had.It’s definitely worth picking up just to experience all the funky corridor spaghetti and the occasional good puzzle, but I also feel the need to warn about the game’s often frustrating and pigheaded determination to not tell the player anything at all – particularly early on, it’s very hard to tell if you’re making any progress or just running around in circles (or indeed, if running around in circles doesn’t actually mean making progress). It’s not a particularly difficult IQ test, it’s just that someone took away the instructions sheet."

Discover an Escher-like world where hallways wrap around upon each other, spaces reconfigure themselves, and accomplishing the impossible may just be the only way forward.”To fully understand Antichamber you must first let go of the idea of object permanency. You know, the thing you learnt as a baby? If you turn around in Antichamber, the corridor behind you will have changed to something else. There are rooms that seem to exist in the 8th dimension and staircases that go in opposite directions that will take you to the same room. You can fall for ages only to end up only a meter from where you fell from. You have a block shooting gun in order to create platforms and hold doors open for you, but it doesn’t always work straight-forwardly. You’ll need excellent pattern recognising skills and you’ll have to be very good at thinking outside the box.The GraphicsAntichamber is mostly black and white with occasional bursts of rainbow colour. There are also cute posters lining the walls that give you hints on how to complete the upcoming puzzle and also give you life advice. The graphics are a little cartoony, but nothing bad.The SoundtrackThe soundtrack gets a little repetitive and annoying after a while. It’s decent, but with the added frustration of having to repeat puzzles over and over again, the combined experience makes you want to never hear those particular songs again.Overall VerdictThis is a mind-melting, frustrating puzzle game that will have you playing for hours. Antichamber is definitely worth the buy and the hours you’ll use playing it!If you'd like to read more reviews from me, join my steam group!"
,Recommended,219890,33538977,Posted: 14 July,all,NamoLeX,"To put it breifly, this is one of the most mind-bending, thought-twisting, brain-melting puzzle games you may ever play. Though fairly challenging, my 19 year old brain was able to solve this. Depending on your experience in puzzle games, it shouldn't be terribly easy or terribly difficult, but somewhere nice and cozy in the middle. The art style is very plain yet full of character and seems reminiscent of Portal or Q.U.B.E. The atmosphere is very mysterious and as far as story goes, there isn't any. This game is so unique in muliple ways, and I have yet to find something quite similar.Overall this game is very polished and well made. Despite me forgetting about it after a few years, it remains a memorable experience that I now wish to try again.I say, ""Give it a shot!""9/10"

You must explore the 3D world from a first person point of view and learn the game mechanics for yourself. The best way to enjoy this game is to not have any outsider knowledge of it, but only if you are into a challenging game with interesting visuals and good exploration. This game is at first somewhat reminiscent of the Portal franchise as has a similar creepiness about it as the sci-fi world of Portal, this strangeness about the game comes from the simplicity of certain surroundings mixed with the signs in game with life morals written on them. The gameplay smooth and nice due to the game being on the Unreal Engine 3. The game's visuals are a very colourful, contrasting and vibrant, making it aesthetically pleasing to play.The game's empty feel isn't perfectly executed and doesn't feel the best, there is also minimal audio in the game; there is also only so much fun to be has from a FPS puzzler.Overall this game is one of the best indie games out there and there isn't too much bad that can be said about it.12/15 - ""Portal on crack"""

This easily the second best first person puzzle platformer that I've ever played. The best is of course Portal. This game isn't as good as Portal. Nothing is. However, I reckon it is slightly better than Portal 2 which is pretty damn amazing considering Portal 2 had GLaDOS in it and this doesn't.Alexander Bruce, the game designer, must be a genius. There are many things in this game that are very clever and demand that the player be clever. I'm no expert but I reckon that isn't so hard to do as a designer. The genius of the game is that it even when it is messing geometry and demanding that the player be clever in order to proceed it never once felt obtuse, it never felt like it was showing off at my expense. Rather it persistently made me feel rather clever for having got my head around its quirks. Part of that is probably the fact there are seemingly multiple solutions to a lot of problems which makes it a question of genuine problem solving rather than trying to read the mind of the designer. It was always interesting, often unexpected but never once felt unfair. That to me is a sign of genius."

Ad while I would be greatly exaggerating to say I was disappointed, this game still wasn't quite what I expected. Really, my only big problem with this game is that it is exactly that: a game. Purely and simply. There is absolutely not plot, story, character, nothin'. It's just a big ol' labyrinth of puzzles with no well-defined beginning or end. That aside, this game excels in every other aspect. The puzzles and logic are just as mind-bending as the trailer implies, and I legitimately found myself stuck on several occasions. One reviewer put it extremely aptly that ""your greatest enemy in this game is yourself."" Puzzles with seemingly obvious answers will leave you baffled as you throw yourself at them again and again, until you realize the answer was indeed simple and obvious, but the approach you assumed was right and then got stuck on, was wrong. Even with it's lack of linearity or storytelling, there is still a strong sense of progression and, dare I say, personal development, as you wander the non-euclidian geography of the game. The puzzles continue to challenge and interest the player throughout, and even when you think you're done, there are bound to be some you missed. The asthetic look of the game is really stunning. Imagine Borderlands meets Portal, and you have this game's graphics. The stark white environment, spiked with occasional splashes of coklor and a few swaths of darkness, really lend to the gameplay too, putting you into a calm, introspective mindset as you play. I say I was stuck several times, but with this game's atmosphere, I was never frustrated. Speaking of atmosphere, the sound design was equally well-done, always giving just the right amount of background noise for the situation. With all it's branching paths and mental workouts, I think this game will have me coming back many a time. I found a door marked ""the end,"" but I don't know if I'll ever truly reach it."

It's hard because Portal 1 was ground breaking and Portal 2 has a story which is entertaining. This game has no story per se but the puzzles and illusions are near flawless. The game looks so simple and generic but it's not. No game to date has as many unique interactive elements as this game. Remember how Portal was trying to explore what else could be done with 3D world other then the same old first person shooters. It's just shoot shoot shoot and E interact. Portal made you take note of your environment and really start to interact with it. Well Antichamber takes it to the next level. So many puzzle games are gimmicky where they reuse the same concept in different ways. Antichamber is unique and has so many new concepts of what can be done with a 3D world. Loved all the easter eggs and how the game continued... don't want to say to much without giving anything away. I would buy games like this all day. I think all devs should play this game to understand the possibilities. I had a friend explain to me why he doesn't like puzzle games, then I realized he had never really played one. Please make a sequel to this game and reinvent 3D all over again, the possibilities are endless. Next time though upgrade the story like Portal did from 1 to 2 and it will go viral."

Nevertheless, if you want to be confused for 20 minutes, give up, try again for another 20 minutes after having a cold cup of apple juice while contemplating why you got the game, then looking up a guide to the part your stuck on, only to repeat this cycle indefinetly until you beat it, then Antichamber is the game for you."

,Recommended,219890,10620798,"Posted: 21 June, 2014",all,Mr. Matt,"This game is pretty darn cool. There are no enemies or allies. It's you in what feels like a surreal, impossible test chamber that goes on a long way. You can press Esc at any time to teleport back to the main room, where you have a little map that lets you pick which puzzle area you want to go to. The objective is to get different ""guns"" that let you take and place blocks. The guns look the same, but they are different colors, and those colors are hints to point you toward blocks of the same color, to let you know you can solve that puzzle now. Each new gun you get replaces the last, and you get them in order (doesn't seem possible to get them out of order if you tried).There are a variety of other puzzles which are solved using the same methods, but each becomes a -piece- of another puzzle, sort of like solving one thing in a Portal test chamber doesn't get you out of the test chamber itself, but just gives you progress. The game does have an ending, and I will admit I had to reference a walkthrough on a couple of occasions, but I still enjoyed the game and will likely play it again. If you can get it for 5 bucks or so, it's great."

,Not Recommended,219890,32274133,Posted: 8 June,all,Kryyss,"Charts showing times for public transport such as trains, planes or buses are fascinating things wouldn't you say? I mean the sheer complexity of them and the amount of effort and work that goes into their creation is immense. Sure people say that buses never run on time but consider that they have to work out the typical speed of a bus through certain sections of a city, taking into account the usual traffic and roughly how long is needed to load and unload passengers at each stop. They really are a huge technical achievement. So why aren't people more interested in them when they claim that Antichamber is one of the most amazing puzzle games ever despite it being nothing more than an incredibly boring yet technically masterful piece of game design?This may seem harsh but the fact is that the developer(s) behind Antichamber clearly know their stuff when it comes to the technical side of using the more advanced trickery in level design. And yet while performing all of this wizardry they completely forgot that it was meant to be fun.Visually it is destinctive only because the frequent use of portals required flat colours or else you could easily notice them. Fair enough. Make technical limitations work for you by building around them. Fine. I can accept that. But then why was it nessersary to makes puzzles such as 'stare at this wall', 'keep running in circles for a minute' and lets not forget those oh so frequently used 'run backwards' puzzles. Antichambers starts off with these being novel ideas but eventually you end up literally in a plain box room with no indications which of these novel ideas are supposed to be used. So you start doing things like running around the walls to see if there is a hidden path that only appears when you're next to it, running backwards towards the door you just came in, walking to see if that triggers something. The list goes on and on.  Puzzle solving isn't about methodically running through every possible trick you know one by one until you get it right, it's supposed to be about being thoughtful or logical.The fact is that there are some very clever puzzles in there but they are far outnumbered by stupidly vague or frustratingly tedious ones that seem more like the developers showing off their technical skills than trying to create an entertaining experience. There is a multitude of better games than this such as The Room or dare I say Riven or Myst if you want a real test of your memory and logic."

The only time I found myself stumped by the game was when it didn't bother to explain its own rules.$20 for a single afternoon worth of mediocre puzzles is not enough value for me to recommend this title."
,Not Recommended,219890,22841902,"Posted: 7 May, 2016",all,Arkensark,"The Good:When you're just starting out and you don't know what the game expects of you there is a definite sense of wonder and satisfied surprise at the curve balls the rooms throw at you.The rooms (and puzzles within) are great. The game plays with your expectations successfully and forces you to think in creative ways. Until you get your first 'gun' and the game begins to devolve.The rooms ARE still good, however, until you get the third gun. After that point the game begins to fall apart completely in terms of impressiveness and mystery and becomes fairly repetitive - turning into a metroidvania with puzzles instead of enemies.Controls are responsive and simple although there are no rebinding options.Hitting escape to warp back to the hub lets you teleport to any room you've previously visited. It's sleek, fast, feels good, and works well. However, there's a glaring problem detailed in 'The Bad' section.There are some rooms that flat out lead to a dead end but the game always tells you to teleport back to the hub to escape. Generally the game avoids these kinds of situations completely by having rooms link back on themselves.The game does a good job of teaching the player the new mechanics with just simple button prompts painted on the walls and the obstacle in front of you serving as a means for experimentation for the player. However, there's one key mechanic with the third gun that is NOT taught or even hinted at to the player and is completely necessary to complete the game.The Bad:Sometimes you find yourself just mindlessly 'pushing buttons' without knowing what your goal is or what you should be aiming for other than pushing the buttons the game wants you to.The game punishes you near the end for trying to apply the lessons you learned earlier in the game because suddenly mechanics have been reversed.The way rooms are linked together makes it a lot harder to keep track of the rooms you have and haven't cleared (as there are a lot of one-way trips down corridors that teleport you). The map gives you NO indication of which rooms you have and haven't cleared - only showing where you've been. The map does have icons but there's no key for this map and the player just has to figure it out on their own.The rooms do all have different names to distinguish them but the names are only ever shown to you in the hub and the player is disincentivised to return to the hub unless absolutely necessary (as the next point below covers) which means that if you solve a lot of rooms in a row only to misstep and teleport back to a room at the start of the game it takes a while to figure out where you actually were to teleport back there.Rooms (solved or not) reset when you warp back to the hub or (sometimes) when you travel a certain distance. This is obviously necessary for some situations where you need a room to reset because you made a mistake. However, when you're solving a puzzle at the end of a sequence of rooms and make a mistake that causes you to warp out and back in you more often than not have to repeat the entire sequence of rooms from scratch. This also slows down your progress when you're searching for the 'next' room, as you have to re-visit old ones with new guns, and have to keep re-solving puzzles you solved hours ago. Overall this wastes a LOT of time and it would be nice if the game saved the states of completed rooms.There are cool 'bonus' rooms that are like museum exhibits (they're usually at the other side of some of the most challenging rooms or puzzles) but there's no indication you're solving a 'bonus' puzzle and finding out you just wasted a lot of time making progress that doesn't help you finish the game can be frustrating.One section puts you in a huge open area with multiple branching paths and elevations. The game gives the player absolutely no direction or objective here and expects the player to know exactly where to go and what to do.Soundtrack ranges from generic calming track such as thunderstorms, sea waves, or tropical noises to horrible ones like pigeons constantly flapping their wings in your ears while you solve a room.The options are pretty sparse: mostly just limited to resolution, fullscreen or windowed toggles, and some for mouse control. The game lacks any graphics settings but I can't see it affecting anyone, even with slow machines. The game focuses a lot of importance on color but there's no color blind options. It's a first person game but there's no way to change the FOV.Overall:I enjoyed my experience with the game until collecting the third 'gun'. At that point the player can (and sometimes must) brute force certain solutions and the game turns into a metroidvania with puzzles instead of enemies.You revisit old rooms with new abilities and have to defeat the re-spawning puzzles while using a terrible map."

I only had the Blue Gun to my avail and I didn't even know about other guns.I mean how could I, this game doesn't really explain anything, which to some people might be the whole appeal of the game.So it appears that without the Red Gun you are not capable of solving the mentioned puzzle.But how could I know this? I don't want to look up the solutions online, so I spent half an hour in roomnot knowing that I can't solve this puzzle.After a while I gave up and went online and then it struck me.You can basically never be sure if you are ""allowed"" to solve a puzzle at any given time.Imagine having a book full of Sudokus, but half of them aren't possible to solve. This is no fun,this is gambling. (not the Vegas gambling, more like csgolotto gambling)In Portal or many other puzzle games this is a no-go.Also I feel like this game would have been a great exploration game, since the puzzlesreally aren't that great to begin with.So do I recommend the game? No. But nonetheless this game has some really great ideas in it and my opinion is only one of many.P.S. I'm ready for your pitchforks and torches.Edit1: Formatting"
76561198182932007,Not Recommended,219890,24367634,"Posted: 17 July, 2016",all,AstronautCat,"After playing a some 3d puzzle games like Portal a few years back, I've been itching to find a something similar that's genuinely tough and really makes me think as a player. This game definately scratches that itch and is genuinely fun to play, but there are some pretty deeply-rooted flaws with it as well.Antichamber is an incredibly challenging puzzle game - but unfortunately some of that challenge comes in the lack of explanation of the simplest mechanics. There's some solid and challenging puzzles there that are very enjoyable, but unforunately there are a many moments when the difficultly surpasses the fun, and objectives are not always clear, which slows pacing, leading to some very frustrating moments.The blinding-white minimalistic environment and asset design is a style which fits the puzzles well and doesn't distract the player, which is a positive. The color scheme is simple, and consits of a few very bright colors. However, it is incredibly tough to look at for long periods of time.  The lack of actual light or visual smoothness on surfaces is difficult to process and understand spacially. There's also no real music or sound beyond a few ambient beach or wind noises here and there - a HUGE missed opportinuty.The other gaping flaw (and my biggest complaint) is that the game itself has little easter-egg rooms that, (while are fun to look at) are poorly scattered throughout, and bring the pacing to a disapointing halt. There is no way to tell whether solving a certain puzzle may be the path to progress or to another dead-end easter-egg room, and finding out you've wasted 20 minutes solving a completely useless puzzle while making no real progress is incredibly frustrating and annoying. And the dizzying overall layout doesn't help this in the slightest.It would have been nice to have some kind of story, something that would make the player feel compelled to continue other than just the satisfaction of winning.  The only thing remotely close to a this are little one-sentence notes which are placed on the walls occasionally. Instead of offering little hints, they're simple and on-the-nose, but the biggest problem is - the notes always come AFTER the puzzle, making them completely irrelevant and near meaningless.Now despite ALL of these flaws I just mentioned, Antichamber is fundamentally a very interesting, unqiue, and fun puzzle game. It's enganging, challenging, and will have you learn its mechanics inside and out if you want to master it. It's a little tough and times, and it'll test your patience, but it is very fun, and rewarding. That being said, I really can't recommend this game to a lot of people, simply because it's just so difficult, and not always in the ways that it should be. If you're looking for a real-head scratcher though, and you're willing to put up with it, this game might just be worth checking out - that is if you find it on sale."

I was uncomfortable in the first five minutes, but I kept playing because I was interested.

However, you will quickly realise, after you gave up on the puzzle and googled it, that you weren't at fault, there was just a tool you needed that was identical to the one you have except with the ability to solve this puzzle. The game of course, quietly neglected to inform you of this.I'm sure that Antichamber's designers justified this to themselves (and to the mass market) by saying ""The normal rules don't apply, we're subverting the tropes of game design"". This, however, is a paper thin charade to mask the truth that is that Antichamber's designers don't know how to present information to a player in a way that equips them to solve or ignore the puzzle appropriately.The game instead opts for confusion over fascination and will quickly lose the interest of anyone looking for an unconventional yet possible puzzle game."

The idea of the areas being more open-ended in the sense that you have multiple (sometimes circular or repeatedly dead-end) paths is not necessarily bad, but I feel like it was exhaustively used.So many people bring up M.C. Escher and talk about this game as being ""art"", but I never got a feeling of art from it at any point. Really, the game just had 3 styles to it with the rooms, as I went along: simple and obvious puzzles; really confusing ones that took forever to run around over and over; and then other more obvious puzzles that were explicitly tedious (e.g., having to make sure you get some blocks exactly and don't lose them or clip them with the ray gun, otherwise you have to restart the rooms).And then you had things like the ""hints""/messages you come across. Basically, they are taunts from the developer. I never got any sort of emotional reaction out of them as if they were special messages - the majority of them were just some cheesy comment relative to the puzzle you just completed. Very rarely would you see a hint about something you were about to do (or about a split in a path).I think that most of the game is doable, but is it actually that fun? To me, it really wasn't."

At the time of this review, I'm very near the end (I think).Unfortunately, Antichamber failed to impress me. The environment looks unfinished, the philosophical hindsight wall panels are boringly cliche and the game has no story and almost zero ambience. The only interesting things about the environment are the ""Three Paths in Sight"" museum room (which had some creatures I hoped I might encounter) and that black Macguffin block that's always floating out of sight and whispering.The audio was just confusing in places. What's with all the sounds of nature? Most of the time, it seems to serve no purpose.This game is supposed to ""mess with my head"", which it did for about two minutes. The non-Euclidean geometry that Antichamber employs would probably have been a lot more effective at messing with me if there was any narrative at all to hook me in. But there isn't, so it isn't very impressive. Once you realize that this is all possible because it's a computer game and can have all the wacky spatial physics that it wants, it sort of takes the fun away. To make up for the lack of plot, I imagined that this game is like a benign version of the movie Cube; where you can't die, and if you just persevere, you will eventually complete it. And there are a lot of cubes.That being said, Antichamber does have some redeeming features. Being able to try any chamber from the start of the game saves you the endless frustration of having to go back through all the other puzzles should you get stuck or fail a section. The game relies quite a bit on a ""learn as you go"" approach, which I appreciate, and the help tools were limited, forcing the player to work out the ""Cube Gun"" and the different color cube functions on their own. Some of the puzzles were actually quite fun to solve.One of the problems with puzzle games is that they have little replay value. However, you may want to play them as a quick run-through for nostalgia's sake (Portal series). But for that to happen, the game has to provide you with some desire to play it. As I went further and further into Antichamber and realized that there was no story at all, it robbed me of my motivation and turned the game into just something to complete, which is a disappointment. I feel like it could have been more, but it seems more like a beta build than a finished game that sells for twenty dollars. I'm glad I bought it on sale, because if I had bought it full price, I would be♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Likely as not, I'll uninstall Antichamber once I've completed it and not play it again.Imagine Portal 2 without GLADOS, Wheatley, Cave Johnson, physics gel, Aerial Faith Plates, cake and only six colors.

It falls in the same category as puzzle games like Portal and Kairo, and in the same exploration genre as The Stanley Parable. This is one of my favourite genres, and I had high expectations for Antichamber.There is no background or story to talk about: You are in the antichamber, and your objective is to make your way through the structure. The problem is that the building does not use the regular laws of physics, and you may turn around just to find out that your path has changed when your back was turned.You will soon have new tools to use in order to manipulate your surroundings and make your way through the maze. I found the game mechanics to be a bit like a clunky mix between Portal and Minecraft. I had at times difficulty to control what I wanted to do and several times I knew exactly what I wanted to do but difficulties in maneuvering made the puzzle solving a tedious task.I love the idea of this game and I am impressed with how well the levels fit together and how much work it must’ve been to make the design. When it comes to the puzzles they were most of the time interesting but the difficulty ranged from very clever to incredibly predictable.You also get a very handy overview of the entire structure which makes it easy to pick and choose what puzzles you want to concentrate on for the moment, or to start over when you have messed up.However, no matter how much I try to enjoy this game, it doesn’t at all live up to my expectations. Considering other reviews I may be very alone with this opinion, but I don’t feel I have any reason to continue playing. In Portal, I wanted to advance because I felt chased. In The Stanley Parable I wanted to break free from the game. In Quantum Conundrum, I wanted to to help my uncle. In Kairo, I fled a dead world. This game, however clever it may be, never gives me that urgent feeling of needing to move forward. I never felt compelled to play the game in order to see what would happen next.I would probably have enjoyed it more if the game would’ve given an impression of the player being trapped instead of the slow lull of just walking around, seeing what physics-bending tricks were around the next corner.3/10 cubes"

There's a difference between trial and error to learn some fundamental mechanic and brute forcing your way through every solution.  There's no build up of knowledge.  In a good puzzle game, you'll find the solution and then think, ""Oh, well that was easy... Why didn't I think of that.""   In this game, there's no aha moment.  When you solve a puzzle here, you think ""How on earth were you supposed to figure that out given the provided stimuli?  That was just stupid.""The other issue is that there's no sensation of progress or achievement.  You end up in the same place 90% of the time and have to go through hoops again to get back to where you wanted to go.

,Not Recommended,219890,12814364,"Posted: 6 November, 2014",all,TheTitaniumDragon,"Antichamber is a 3D first-person puzzle solving game. With an extremely minimalistic artistic scheme and no story to speak of, the only thing it has is the puzzles and the very aesthetic. The three-dimensional space isn't one; the corridors loop in on themselves in utterly impossible ways, and it is possible to go upstairs to go down, go downstairs to go up, or end up in the exact place you started by going forwards or backwards. The whole thing is very confusing to navigate, furthering the theme of disorientation, but a few puzzles hold it back from greatness.StoryThere is no story, only motivational posters on the walls.GameplayThe core of this game is the gameplay, and the core of the gameplay is the puzzles. Your goal is to escape the antichamber, and the exit is visible from where you start... or so you think, anyway. In reality, you pass by this door four times, and each time it has a different poster behind it until you finally are allowed to leave by truly finding the exit.Early in the game, you discover that the layouts of the rooms are not, in fact, three-dimensional but rather can change around you by completing various tasks, walking in certain directions, or even looking in certain directions. The environment serves to disorient the player, as well as a puzzle element, forcing you to figure out the proper way to navigate the environment. Some puzzles can only be solved by backtracking as the area behind you has changed; others merely SEEM repetitive when you are actually making very subtle progress.Later, you gain the ability to manipulate cubes with a gun. It starts out with just the ability to pick up blocks, then deposit them elsewhere, but over the course of the game you gain the ability to place them continuously through slits in walls (allowing you to fill up certain sort of ""wall gauges""), pull them around with your gun (allowing you to, among other things, ride cubes, as well as allowing you to solve some puzzles where the cubes are behind glass and only by moving them can you solve the puzzle), and eventually the ability to multiply cubes and place (and suck up) large sheets of them, allowing you to easily construct staircases and create platforms.The puzzles vary from quite simple to fairly difficult, though most of the puzzles take very little time to actually solve, and very few of the puzzles are reflex based - rather, it is mostly purely about figuring out exactly what you are supposed to do, or how you are supposed to get cubes into various places which destroy your cubes or otherwise make your life difficult.The puzzles are mostly fairly reasonable, but there are a few puzzles which are only solvable in fairly strange ways. The worst, amusingly, is one of the simplest puzzles in the game - the final exit is barred by a barrier surrounded by a force field you cannot grab cubes through. The solution is obvious - you need to suck away some of the cubes with your gun. But there is no apparent way to do so - there is no source of cubes you can use to solve the puzzle with, and there's no apparent way to grab the cubes. The actual solution is to walk down the stairs and shoot through a very narrow slit between the ground and the bottom of the forcefield - it doesn't require anything clever, merely that. It was a very disappointing and annoying puzzle.Overall, though, the game feels like it has a reasonable difficulty level, and most of the puzzles make sense, though a few require you to remember some semi-obscure mechanics of the cubes, such as the fact that creating a continuous outline of cubes will fill in the middle of them (something which only comes up a very small number of times, then not again for a long time... at which point it is integral for solving a puzzle that more or less obsoletes the mechanic thanks to the gun upgrade).One interesting aspect to the early game is that there is a timer on the wall which counts down from 90 minutes. It is constantly there and prominently displayed, ticking away, and it really encourages you to rush to try and solve the game. Interestingly, the timer has no purpose whatsoever - the only purpose is to mess with the player, as absolutely nothing happens when it runs out other than a message being displayed on the wall.GraphicsThe game looks very sharp. The graphics are clean and crisp and the environment is suitably strange. My only real complaint is that some of the washes of colors on the wall just don't look quite as clean as the otherwise aseptic environment would suggest they should.Final SummaryAntichamber is a very reasonable puzzle game which will likely take you a good 6 hours to complete, possibly longer depending on whether you get stuck on some of the puzzles or attempt some of the puzzles that you cannot solve before you're supposed to do so. The constantly shifting environment is wonderfully confusing and the puzzles are mostly reasonable, but the game lacks the character of games like Portal. It is puzzles, puzzles, and nothing but puzzles, and if you're expecting anything else out of it, you will be disappointed. If you want to try your hand at a puzzle game that gives you very little guidance beyond the controls, though, this game might be for you.C+"

I really liked a lot of the early puzzles where they were based on thinking on your feet and observing the world around you. However, a puzzle game would be remiss if it didn't add some new twist as the game progressed to keep the mechanics interesting.This extension comes in the form of a gun, that lets you collect and place blocks in the environment. And early on, this skill is cool and adds to the gameplay. But this is where you start to see a shift in the game. What was once again about dealing with these insane rules of engagement, quickly devolves into something whose mechanics feel surprisingly similar to Portal.However, the gun brings me to my biggest complaint about the game, which is it's Metroid-vania, run into a puzzle now but you may not be able to solve it attitude. It led to sections of the game where I would beat my head against the wall thinking that I could solve it, or that I had all of the powers I could get and then there must be a way to solve the puzzle with what I had. But instead I was just wasting my own time on a puzzle I wasn't equipped for.I did love the mind-bending puzzles, when they were around and the aesthetic of the entire game is visually stunning. This game does end up being ultimately competent and I would suggest it to anyone who really loves puzzle games, but for the casual observer I would suggest maybe playing the first couple of minutes at a friend’s house."

,Not Recommended,219890,8444589,"Posted: 30 December, 2013",all,Frahg,"This is a game that is not deserving of the praise that it receives.  On the one hand, it has an interesting and unique graphical style and (for the first part of the game at least) has an entertaining way of undermining your expectations.  For example, you may walk down a cooridor and find that it never ends, and the only exit is to turn around and go back the way you came and you discover that the door you came in, actually leads out to a new location.The game is filled with puzzles like this that defy your expectations.  Where things in the world change and your perspective and location play a key role in discovery of the solution.That's the good, but the game is horribly flawed in several ways.The first is that all the puzzles are presented without explanation or hint at their solution.  Because the world is horribly inconsistent, the only real way to solve a puzzle is brute force--to try everything you can think of.  As the game goes on and on, the things you can think of grow and grow and eventually even a simple puzzle can have dozens of time-consuming possible solutions.Sometimes the solutions are clever and interesting, but often they're just not obvious.  It's like if I had hidden the key to a door behind a rock next to the door and you spent forever trying to open the door only to finally realize the key was there the whole time.  It's not a satisfying solution to the problem, it's just obscured.Often the solutions aren't that easy.  They sometimes consist of building difficult bridges out of blocks or dragging blocks through hard-to-control keyholes.  If you are doing things right, this wouldn't seem like much of a problem, but when you are doing the wrong thing it just wastes your time.  Often, once you realize you have gone down the wrong path the only way back is to return to the start, which resets your progress in every puzzle.  Much  time can be spent unrewardingly as you try and fail different solutions.The game also introduces tools but doesn't explain how they work.  I got one of the guns only to find that holding CTRL does something critical to solving puzzles.  There is nowhere in the game they suggest that CTRL does ANYTHING.  The menu which at first I felt was clever, doesn't adequately explain all the buttons that the game utilizes.  Eventually I accidentally discovered this additional control and that made me more frustrated than satisfied (Turns out CTRL is a replacement for the middle mouse button, and the middle mouse button isn't mentioned in the controls either.)The puzzles are presented in a non-linear fashion so you can go to an area and spend time trying to solve puzzles you aren't equipped for.  It's hard to tell when you're inept at a puzzle and when you're not prepared to defeat it.  It's not like you go somewhere and the keyhole is triangular but you only have square keys.  Instead everywhere the game deceives you so you spend time exploring, only to often discover that there is nothing to find--you are just in the wrong place at the wrong time.Ultimately, the reason this game is getting such praise is that the things the puzzles do are very interesting and surprising.  The puzzles toy with your expectations the way an M.C. Escher drawing is engaging to look at.  But what a player does to discover these solutions is just brute force trial and error.  There is little smarts to solving the puzzles and so it's not a rewarding endeavour to attempt to solve them.Seeing all the puzzles solved in a video would be way more engaging than playing this game, and ultimately games should be fun to play.  When gameplay fails, the game fails."

Yes some people may see a lot of replay-ability in this game but I can't see that, so it wasn't until the summer sale when I picked up this game for £3.First of all, I do like the concept and graphics style of the game, it has a very unique puzzle system which is displayed very well in a 3D engine. Upon playing the game the game however, I was quite disappointed with how little reward I felt from completing a puzzle as it threw me straight into another. Also, I felt some parts of the game were quite punishing when you make a mistake, but I can ignore this as you can quite easily get back to where you were using the menu (which in my opinion is quite well done).One final point though which makes me dislike this game is the fact that the end goal is not obvious if it even has one. You may think there needs not be an end goal as you can just carry on finding new puzzles to solve, but I feel like there is no point in doing the puzzles if there is nothing to show for it.Please bear in mind that my opinions were drawn from the little amount of time that I have played the game and that you most likely feel a different way about the game."

A classic case of me falling for professional reviewers, really. I heard people talking about how amazed they were by this game, playing it at PAX while it was still in development. How mind bending and innovative, how hard or near impossible to grasp it was.But it isn't. It's a very clumsily put together puzzle game that seems to try its best to confuse you.You're thrown into a big maze like level, full of bare, same-looking corridors. There's a bunch of pictures and text, giving the impression to be some kind of bizzare super self reflected, meta level commentary on the game itself and/or life in general; or maybe it isn't and that's just what I'm seeing/reading, but in any case it's there to confuse you. And I think the game does this with evil intent, using this confusion to obscure its biggest flaw: that there is no game.The graphics are horrible, the sound design is non existant (there's practically no music in the game & almost no ambient sounds), the puzzle design is terrible as it is mostly a bunch of old portal tricks (not the game Portal, but portal level loading technology as used by all 3D games since the 90s) and the level design, as I already stated, is just a big huge winding corridor.If you like puzzle games and play this game for the first time after having read a very negative opinion like this one, going at the game with very low expectations, I can see how it might surprise you and you'll like it.But if you have any hopes that this could be a good game, another Braid or what have you, you'll probably be sorely disappointed - I was.If you think about playing this, wait for a sale. Don't spend more than 5 bucks on it, it's not worth it."

The reality is i found I spent more time fighting The controls than getting the puzzles solved.  Many times I just wanted to do something with the gun but it merely does not function well at all.  If you don't mind fighting the tools you need to get through the puzzles, the non-gun puzzles are interesting.  I still feel many times the puzzles like to remind you of the poor controls which meant the exploration was gone and puzzles became, more frustrating and tedious than fun.  I do not recommend this game, but i think its worth watching a playthrough."

That's probably why they stretched things, so people can't finish the game in an hour and then refund it, because it's all the same crap. There are almost NO puzzles. What they call ""puzzle"" is usually not solved with your brain, but simply by getting the next gun upgrade. Can't solve something? Just do something else, if you can't solve something in 1 second of thinking, you are lacking gun functions, like spreading blocks, or the rapid suck thing...Also... The game is simply not finished. The biggest secret of the game, those pink cubes that move when you look at them, DON'T DO ANYTHING! And that since the game came out... Typical Steam ""Indie games"" The dev makes some money, game is not even finished, and the dev is gone..."

AND IT IS ITS GAMEBREAKING LETDOWN AT THE SAME TIME.Remember the good old days when leveldesign was SO BAD you walked the SAME CORRIDOR A 100 TIMES OVER?THIS IS THAT GAME!!!The minimap is an ABOMINATION.Here's a screenshot:MinimapDoes this map tell you - in an intuitive way:- Where' you've been?- Where to go?- What the objectives are?- Where your current objective is?The game is designed so HORRENDOUSLY BAD  i had to go to youtube for a walkthrough after 10 minutes.But wait! A Wahkthroug requires me to know WHERE IN THE GAME PROGRESSION I AM  and guess what: YOU DON'T KNOW THAT!Every game has SOMETHING you can enter in Google to find a walkthrough like 'Chapter 4' or  a Level-Name like 'The Dungeon'  or something.The Steam Forum us FULL of people not understanding the map!Go to the Discussions of this game and enter 'Map' - your buying decision should immediately be cristal clear: DON'T!!!!!!!!!!!HERE'S A HINT DEVS: A LITTLE RED DOT ON THE ROOMS YOU NEED TO GO TO. AN INDICATOR.  JUST. SOMETHING.Let me tell you, the riddles are semi-complicated. I did not really have problems with those._FINDING_ THE_WAY_ TO A RIDDLE  _THAT_ IS THE HARD PART!Imagine this: Farcry, openworld and whatever. You can go everywhere, even the areas you're not supposed to go yet. Those openworld games indicate that pretty good. This game doesn't indicate  it AT ALL. You don't even have the right gun yet and stand in a room that requires the 'red' gun',  you are completely screwed.Okay, and before someone shows up here saying 'ooh, there's screenshots, there's a WIKI [yes I found that] which tells you how to read the minimap and what rooms you are supposed to go.'Let me tell you folks right here:IF YOU DESIGN A MINIMALISTIC GAME. A SIMPLISTIC GAME WITHOUT TUTORIAL, JUST LEARNING ON THE GO - THEN MAKE _EVERYTHING_ SIMPLISTIC SO PEOPLE CAN TAG ALONG!!I should NOT have to leave the game EVER to look up something SO BASIC  as a MINIMAP!!!!!!This has been done a 1000 times by a 1000 games, and YOU GUYS SCREWED IT UP!!!!!!!You bend rooms, warp time, make good puzzles..... and then screw up your MOST IMPORTANT TOOL to navigate the 4th dimension: YOUR MAP!!!!! This is sooo F........I bought this for 3 bucks on wintersale instead of 20. I can only imagine what someone feels after spending 20 bucks on THIS.It is funny because I spent quite some time in puzzle games I bought during this sale. So BEFORE YOU BUY THIS GAME, RATHER BUY:- prismatica- perfectfit totemland- all Hexcells games- Wayout- KnightsThis game should look at games like WAYOUT and KNIGHTS. Now THAT is a textbook example on how to do a minimalistic puzzler WITHOUT tutorial and minimalistic design.This game is Portal with Prey (the old game 'Prey', maybe you remember) and some platforming.It is horrible in every aspect.Just a little story to end this: I found out that I need to go to the room 'Butterfly Effect'. I found out after googling how to read the minimap because it's an ABOMINATION. So I go to Butterfly effect BECAUSE THE MINIMAP INDICATES ME TO DO SO.In fact, you're SCREWED from the start, you must teleport in the room BEFORE Butterfly Effect, because otherways you are missing a cube.Here it comes... The room BEFORE Butterfly Effect shows up as COMPLETED on the minimap. WHY WOULD WE GO THERE???Keep off this game. I spent DAYS on puzzling games this season on steam and android, and NOT ONE game has gotten me frustrated. THIS ONE DID. IN LESS THAN AN HOUR!!AND LET ME MAKE THIS VERY CLEAR: IT RUNS OK, THE PUZZLES ARE OK AND SOLVEABLE, THE GRAPHICS ARE OK, TOO.IT IS THE LAZY DESIGN, THE NOT-THOUGHT-THROUGH CONSISTENCY OF THE GAME THAT WILL MAKE YOU SOOOO MAD!!!"

Timers in games stress me out and my inference from this countdown was that I needed to fully explore everything before it reached zero or I would either fail or at least not 100% the game. So I stopped playing and left my review. Based on your comments I looked up what the timer is and realized it is a joke. While I do not think such misdirection is clever or wise to include in a puzzle game (it made me almost instantly dislike what might otherwise be a good game) I may pick it up again now knowing that the time burden is not real.

It makes me feel like at first, the developers wanted to make a puzzle game, but then they got so proud of themselves that they started thinking they're gods, or some sort of wizards of life. So, the devs started putting in some dumbest ""world truths"", and ""eternal wisdoms"" into the game, and turned it into a cult of suicidal brainwashing.I say, hey you, Ghandis of steam. Your emolosophy belongs on a low quality grayscale internet picture with a background of a person sadly looking into a window, something a spoiled anorexic chick would upload on her instagram.This game was made by a group of depressed autists who are trying to tell you that killing yourself is just a step into the brighter future. The irony though is that playing this trash made me believe that there is no future for humanity.This game tries to appeal to a group of people that doesn't exist on earth - hot shallow-minded gold-diggers who love rubik's cubes, fps shooters, and logical puzzles.The dev team is very lucky, and should be very thankful to the homosexual males - they kinda here and there hit the perfect spot for this game's target audience, and also are the people who ""recommended"" it for others to play.

Instead of a congeries of spheres hanging from the ceiling, GLaDOS is now GOD, has complete mastery over the fabric of space, does not feel the need to directly communicate with the player, and may not actually exist. (Maybe the maze just DOES THAT, with no guiding intelligence behind it.)

So even after the level is ""solved"", you can still have difficulty performing the solution. For an example of this, check out Quantum Conundrum.In this game, the game itself is the puzzle. Once you figure out the solution to an obsticle, it's done, you figured it out.

Every aspect of this game is built to mess with your mind, and the puzzles are the most solid and interesting i've seen in any game to date.The puzzles themselves aren't in a linear ""complete one, do the next one"" structure. Every corner you turn has another brain teaser waiting behind it, and the order you encounter puzzles is only determined by your curiosity to explore the world. The game world and soundtrack work incredibly well together to make you feel constantly uncomfortable with your surroundings. But the greatest feeling you get from the game is the sense of achievement when you conquer one of the many unconventional puzzles, which allows you to progress forward and stumble upon a sign theat tells you to turn around and you realise the area you just walked through is no longer there, thus reapplying that curiosity that's driven you throughout the entire game.

Learning the game mechanics, mostly by trail an error, are among the most satisfying experiences this game has to offer. At the same time, its the finicky nature of the mechanics that are the most irritating part of the game. Sometimes you know how to solve a puzzle, but simply fail at executing the solution over and over.I personally regret playing this game.

76561197972250116,Recommended,219890,8492808,"Posted: 1 January, 2014",all,Foofanoo,"Antechamber is an original and fun game. The game mechanics and particle gun (if that's what it's called) are very clever and well exposed. It feels as though the gun modes were made first, then the puzzles were arranged to demonstrate the capabilities of each mechanic. There are some great 'click' moments when the solution requires you to use the gun in a new way. A great balance of difficulty, chore-factor, and frustration.The first puzzle in the game asks you to choose one of two hallways, and each one leads back to the original choice. To progress, you have to turn around half way through one hall and go back. The game is introducing itself as a 'think outside the square' puzzler. The problem is, you can't actually 'think' about a puzzle like that, it's like searching an invisible door. To solve it, you have to systematically try everything, which is not fun. To me, that first puzzle undersold the rest of the game. There is much more to Antechamber than rooms that sneakily change behind your back. Picking up the first gun made me keep playing and with the first gun upgrade I knew why this game had succeeded.The map and progression sequence are also very original. I'm not sure that this works well. You keep walking around the amorphous main level and access new areas as you gain abilities. Each main room can be accessed from the 'menu screen' (which is actually an area with a clickable wall). There are also linear sequences of rooms where you puzzle through to a dead end, to be rewarded with some extras, development screenshots, concepts and the like. You only really know you've moved forward when you upgrade the gun. It's often hard to tell whether you've missed something without endlessly crawling through the whole map one square at a time.For full completion, you have to find about 100 wall panels. They have a 'the oatmeal' style cartoon with a saying such as 'try try again'. I like the game, but the panels are terrible and I hate them. They look hideous; white lines on black. More importantly, the game and puzzle style is extremely eldritch and mysterious. These cutesy little cartoons are way out of place and almost ruin the theme. It would have been far better to lose them and have the slogans by themselves. Maybe in a creepy font.Final gripe, in the hardest linear sequence the devs 'forgot' to put anything at the end. I spent minutes on end in a featureless room, that locks when you enter, looking for another ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t invisible door or anything. It was a lame laugh for the devs at my expense and I'm still mad almost a year later.In summary, I am very much a fan of this game and would recommend to others. The minimal white-on-white graphics style is striking. It is very long and intricate for an indie-release, and much more cerebral and original than most blockbuster games. I think the fact that I have so many memories (fond and otherwise) shows how deeply I was engaged."

This pretty much sums up the experience... but that's not necessarily a bad thing. It's quite refreshing, actually. But let's start at the beginning - what is Antichamber exactly? It's not easy to explain. It's a puzzle game, but the puzzles you solve are not exactly of a traditional nature. The game is set in some sort of nondescript facility, comprised of interconnected hallways and chambers. Visually, the world is quite simple, made up mostly of bright white walls with a spattering of color here and there. You explore in first person and must figure out how to solve each room in order to progress. And that's where it gets even harder to explain. The solutions are far from clear-cut and there is no one main mechanic that is used from start to finish. You just have to think, experiment, and explore. Eventually you will find a tool that is able to manipulate small cubes that are scattered throughout the facility. But unlike in a puzzle game like Portal for instance, the cube ""gun"" is not the only component of the puzzle-solving experience (though it does become so later on). Rather, at first, you will likely just spend a couple of hours exploring, getting lost, and trying to figure out just what the hell is going on. It takes a little while to adapt to how the game wants you to think, but once you have learned how to solve certain problems, it opens up more of the world for you to explore. I know this explanation sounds very vague, but it's almost impossible not to be when trying to explain this game - it is very... unconventional. That said, I thought the game was really cool, though I can definitely see that it would not be for everyone. If you like games that have a clear goal, explain their mechanics well, and don't require much thinking, then this is most definitely not the game for you. If, on the other hand, you are curious to try something that is vague, never provides anything in the way of explanation, and has some truly ""out-there"" puzzles to solve, you just might find Antichamber to be a breath of fresh air. All in all, this is a worthy experiment in the puzzle game genre, and unlike anything else I have ever played. Check it out if you think it may interest you - just don't hold me responsible for how much hair you end up pulling out of your head in frustration."

I am a pretentious sod who can enjoy walking simulators just fine, but this takes the cake with not even trying to have a story and instead hiding behind ""puzzles"" that aren't even puzzles, just optical illusions, to drive the game forward. And by forward I mean moving you in circles with no sense of acomplishment. Also, for wearing the ""art game"" label like a shield, the game looks awful, it's just white rooms with some cell shading and colors here and there basically, which just looks cheap and tacky.If you like this game, good for you. As for me, I would say stay far far away from this pretentious confused mess of a failed experiment. It's not fun, it's not challenging, it isn't good at being art, it's not as much confusing and surreal as it is silly, it's message is the kind of garbage people post on FB to make themselves look smarter than they are and the main gimmick of the game gets old after 10 minutes.

Thoughts that fit within said metaphroical box will not help you much. Outside of the box there are abstract thoughts. Thoughts that have no real connection to what you see.

You can visit any room you'd like, and they all connect to one another in some fashion. In fact, you'll probably end up searching for new rooms inside of rooms you previously thought to be completed once you discover new mechanics. That's another big thing: discovery. Preferably you should go into this without having any idea what you're in for. Trust me, it's magical.Unfortunately, this isn't a game that lends itself to an informative review very well. There isn't a story, most of the mechanics aren't reoccuring and the few that are would be big spoilers, and it's a game best played without knowing much about it before hand. I can say this, though, it's a game about removing preconceptions. The common theme is that things don't work as you'd expect them to.However, from a practical standpoint, I can tell you that it's about 5-6 hours long - maybe shorter if you figure it out really fast - replaying it is kind of pointless, and there's some pretty brain-racking stuff in it. The graphics are okay, the music is ambient, and the sound effects are better than stock ones. As I said before, there's not really a story, which is honestly a good thing for this game. If what I've said so far hasn't sold you, maybe the fact that I'm trying so hard to avoid ruining the experience for you will.Sorry for the lack of cohesion and conciseness in this review. Each paragraph is basically an isolated attempt to explain and convince you to buy this. And, as I said before, this is hard to talk about without really ruining it for you."

These same doodles also give you life tips, and I was seriously sad when I saw the last one.Also, this game HAS a story, although it is very surreal and open to interpretation.

If you like puzzle games, then I'd highly recommend Antichamber.The game is non-linear, if you get stuck on something you can leave it for later and continue with the game elsewhere. This means you can avoid the frustration of not being able to progress, and makes for a relaxing and interesting experience.The sound design and sountrack is amazing, various different atmospheric soundscapes play, all with a trance like feel to them. The minimalistic surroundings work well in this game, using colours and shapes to guide you and distinguish different areas. As you progress you 'unlock' various metaphors and sayings which both tell several stories, as well as help you progress.The programming is incredibly well done and the ""Impossible Geometry"" seen in art work is brought to life and utilised in creating a surreal experience. The controls are easy to use, and the game mechanics are incredibly unique.The only problems I encountered were due to my keyboard, and the innability I had to change key bindings, but this hardly affected gameplay. And if you want a game with a lot of replay value, this mightn't be the one. Before the game's end, you can return to places you've been and follow different routes to find new areas, however once you've solved a puzzle it's easy to do it again without much thought."

As you progress you find a strange gun that ends up with tons of novel ways of interacting with the environment. On top of all that the art style is incredibly well executed. The game took me about 6 and a half hours to “beat”, I say beat like that because even though I viewed the credits and the end of the game there are still rooms I didn't solve.

I found most puzzles that seemed ""unsolvable"" were resolved after stepping back and returning later with a new approach. Remembering what you have learnt before, but finding new ways to approach things is key here. It's a fantastic experience to encourage you to look at anything from a new perspective and genuinely feels rewarding to find a solution.Definitely not for the impatient, but certainly a great experience for those who like exploration and challenging puzzles."

You will have to reset on a regular basis, trying again and again and again to complete certain puzzles, simply because they require you to think in an abstract way.Antichamber is a lot like the Portal series, in that they are FPS puzzle games that make you think outside the box to get further... except Antichamber upped the Anti (get it?). You get access to several different guns that each have their own abilities, including the abilities of any lesser guns you get along the way. You will need to suck up and place blocks, manipulate the environment around you and even solve puzzles using the hints you get on the walls as you walk through the endless corridors.I would recommend this game in a heartbeat, since it is so great and it even has some replay value. Though do watch the timer as you play. Seriously. Watch it."
76561198046724806,Recommended,219890,8907250,"Posted: 29 January, 2014",all,OperatorHunterM,"Antichamber's delight comes by surprise and the unexpected. In a nutshell, you're a wandering soul moving through chamber after chamber, all with their own puzzles and problems that eventually have to be solved. But this isn't Portal, despite similar movement and ideas, and the pacing is very different as well.It's meant to confuse you, starting with how you progress. Choosing what route you want to take and following it, is all a part of the game. There can be no wrong answer to where you want to go first. You'll start in the main hub which you can always return to if you get lost. (That will happen often) The hub has details on a map system which shows where you've been and what you've solved for each room. It's a helpful guide for remembering what you still need to accomplish, because when you're out in the chambers themselves, losing your way is just a must.For the puzzles you'll have your indirect and direct. The indirect puzzles are charming, usually a ""think outside the box"" scenario that will have you confused for a minute or two. For example, you enter a room with two doors, A and B. But after moving through both doors and being led to the same spot, you frustratingly give up and leave. Only then do you find that that's the solution, taking you to the new room that you needed to go.Direct puzzles are the real head scratchers though and the ones I enjoyed the most. These puzzles follow a more common formula, usually involving building blocks of different colors found among the chamber that you manipulate. Where you place these pieces of matter, how to move them from one room to the next or how to get past them, is never a trick or cheap. Usually it'd take me a good five to ten minutes to come up with a solution. I'm amazed at how frustrating and at the same time calming these scenarios are. At any point I can walk away, and solve an easier room, or maybe just skip the puzzle all together and get into the door a different way. Antichamber allows you chew on its problems and nothing needs your immediate attention.But boy, when you solve it, even if the size of the reward is very minor, contentment is aplenty. Despite difficult puzzles sometimes leading me to rooms I'd been in, getting that puzzle accomplished is always satisfying. Often a hard puzzle is setting you up for a tougher one down the road, one that now you understand how to solve. And once you beat it you DO get rewarded nicely. It all ties together so well, the pacing and the puzzles. Sure, I never understand where I'm going, but I can't wait to get there.So while gameplay is solid in a confusing and sometimes rewarding/ frustrating environment, what about the rest? What about the story, art and soundtrack? There isn't a ""story"" in Antichamber, which is disappointing. It does have its own personality, helpful hints/rewards are given whenever you solve a puzzle and these are collected in the main hub. Each little picture has a thought on life, which really if there was a story to this game, is what it would be about: learning about your mistakes and accomplishments before reaching an end. The art, while sometimes reflecting this, can be very abstract and unlike the puzzles doesn't have a common theme to it. Some chambers are very plain while others are out there, but there's no reason behind it. Even events that happen later, a mysterious entity you follow through the chambers during the second half don't connect as well with the theme of the puzzles. The soundtrack while not outstanding, never had me bored with its very ambient like music and moody themes, which fit.But then again, the strange hints of life, weird art and melancholy sounds, all of it being random might just be the point. How you view the experience and what it means to you will be different for every player, and for that I give Antichamber high regards.Summary: Unique gameplay that confuses and charms you, and leaves you wanting more (though honestly after brief periods of shutting off your computer to take a break). The story is very light and mostly in undertones, which is the only downside. Despite that, and the 20$ needed to buy the game, it's a rock solid 12+ hours of gameplay that I really enjoyed. Gameplay is just great.8/10"

However, if one compares the progress you make in each game, Portal is definately the more linear game, while Antichamber is... DEFINATELY NOT linear. Antichamber will make you go forwards, backwards, side to side, through walls, chutes, and interconnected chambers, and all you have to help you are the many signs posted throughout the game, your matter gun [once you get it, of course], and your brains.One issue is the control scheme, which is more or less locked; You move throughout the game using six keys off the keyboard, and your mouse manipulates the matter gun (shocking!). However, with regards to the mattergun, when you need to use the wheel button on your mouse, and your mouse either lacks one, or it doesn't respond when you press it in game, use the left ctrl key to make up for it; not informing the players that the left Ctrl is a viable button did put a damper on my own experience playing the game.While Antichamber does not have any achievements at the time of this review, it can be easily said that if you play through Antichamber for the first time, I GUARANTEE you will say ""What the #$%^"" at least a once... if you aren't just saying it through the entire game."

While most puzzle games introduce a defined rule set and task the players with solving problems within these rules, antichamber is built around the core idea of breaking rules, forcing the player to expect the unexpected and adapt to the game's convoluted but oddly consistent logic.This quirky design could easily be enough to turn the game into an incoherent mess, but antichamber's razor sharp level design, deliberately assembled visuals and an overall understanding of the player's mind underpin the entire experience with a direction and message that holds the game together and elevates it to something more than a string of puzzles.

This is a game that reminds game designers to have faith in their players.So many games these days just hold your hand, and this game reminds me that (as a special snowflake human) I can come up with dozens of independent and creative solutions with zero hints, and try them all (where only 1 will actually succeed). Not only do the puzzles bend your mind in a way that it's never before bent, it also (occasionally) challenges you with a few twitch / timing skills. Not for the casual. While Portal 2 is the king of accessibility and that perfect sweet-spot for super-satisfying puzzle solving, Antichamber is the opposite, though in the same genre.In a game with no death or even a failure metric of any kind, it is the purest and most challenging puzzle experience I've ever had. Note that there are very few clever systems here, aside from the 'core' block-collection mechanic, which is not always present. Most of the puzzles are odd one-off scripted puzzles that encourage you always try new things, keep an open mind, and keep experimenting. I won't say more because that's all part of the experience.Note that I had a very hard time playing for more than a half hour or hour at a time, which is fine because the game is only about 6 hours (more or less depending on if you're smarter or dumber than me). Most of that time can be accounted for with experimentation, which after so many failed experiments can be frustrating. My biggest complaint with Antichamber is that a few of the puzzles require some process that can be difficult to execute or are time consuming. Sometimes failure can require you to repeat the process which is obnoxious.The game is faux-philisophical about life in general which can come across as a little pretentious but usually feels genuinely encouraging. The ending is fascinating, but I should've expected that it feels a little disjointed from the theme of the rest of the game, though it was worth seeing (and the pre-ending sequences were particularly well designed and are the most fun in the game).In conclusion, I'd only recommend Antichamber if you like testing your logical limits and are a hardcore gamer, both, or you are a game designer.  If you're in that target audience though, Antichamber is a game to remember."

So not just a fun game, but a mindbuilding excercise as well."

No other game I've ever played has evoked such feelings of curiosity and fascination in me as this one has. Instead of holding the player's hand, the game uses subtle hints to nudge the player in the right direction. It's strictly up to the player to learn the strange rules and nuances of the world and apply them to the game's many puzzles.Because of this, there were several moments where I ended up hitting my head against the wall over and over. I bought the game close to when it was first released, but the first time I played through, I ended up getting so frustrated that I didn't touch it again until a year later. When I did, I blew past the part that had given me so much trouble before. Sometimes just walking away from the game for a day or so and returning to it with a fresh mind was all I needed to get past the problem sections. By the time that I had discovered everything the game had to offer, the last puzzle, essentially the game's final exam, was a breeze.By the end of Antichamber, the meaning of my journey hadn't become any clearer. However, that certainly didn't take away any of the satisfaction of having gone through it. I'm a little sad, though, as it may be a while before another game arrives that sates my sense of discovery like this one has."

The gameplay mechanics are top notch introducing new concepts into each and every turn. It very much seems like once you think you know what is going on it throws you for a loop forcing you to rethink or re-evaluate how you approach a certain puzzle. Sometimes it is how you look at a problem and your self perception that makes it hard or easy, only one thing can be for sure that this game will bend the way you approach problems and make you see things from a different light.

You set out from the Antichamber for the first time and immedeiately realise the possibilities and expanse of the game. The puzzles are all excellent and (mostly) challenge the player and each one completed is rewarding - not just because of the progress made, but for the 'aha' moment, which is perhaps the best part of this game.I don't want to say much more, as I think it would spoil the game for you, which you should definitely buy and play right to the end as I did (although, once you start, it's hard to stop anyway).Definitely worth the money.

The first puzzle sets you up for failure, and many of the other puzzles require a lot of trial and error. In my experience, these puzzles are classified as non euclidian. That means that it does not follow the normal laws of space. One of the most iconic puzzles is the two colored stairs. The blue staircase brings you back to the start of the stairs, the place it shouldn't have taken you. The red stairs do the sameIn terms of gameplay, the puzzles are really interesting and varied, with many different kinds of puzzles. These puzzles are not set to be played in an order, save for like the first two. This allows for the game to be beaten in ten minutes. There is a weapon that takes colored blocks that and changes the form of them, and you find more advanced versions of the gun as you keep playing. But regarding the ""free roam"" nature of the puzzles it may take a while to find the gun or you might stumble across a more advanced version you aren't supposed to find yet. That might be frustrating at first, but you learn that the advanced versions of the weapon do the same things the outdated versions do as well.In regard to asthetic, the game looks very good as far as art style goes. It pulls off the sanitized white vibe well. There are some light dabs of color that fit well too. The complicated puzzles have to fit somewhere though, so sometimes you can see bits you aren't supposed to. The thing that sets it apart from most puzzle games is the ambiance. Not music, but ambiance, where there are just little sound effects like the ocean or birds flapping.Overall, the game is one of the best hyper puzzles on Steam if you can handle some flaws in the flow of solving puzzles."

You can go to any puzzle at any time to figure it out; in fact, in a few puzzles, this is the only way to solve them, as you get better equipment.- Amazing soundscape, dynamically changes around from rain sounds, birdcalls, swamp/creek frog sounds, crickets, waves. Basically everything you can find on youtube for ""Relaxing sound"" is in the game as a background.- Simple, uncompromising details. Most objects are simple 1 color models. Nothing to criticise graphicswise, as it is all supposed to be simple and not detailed.- Thought-provoking life tips throughout the game that accumulate on a wall in the main room.Cons:- A lot of the game is pure white which may hurt some people's eyes, especially if you play with an Oculus Rift.- No 4k support or advanced options- Somewhat clunky controls; no deficit to gameplay.Overall it's one of the best puzzle games I've played, if not the.

If it turns out I was lacking some basic comprehension of a game mechanic, that can result in my losing the enjoyment of the remainder of the game, simply because I wasn't willing to do a general hunt through the whole game to figure out where I should be looking for the missing piece.This game avoids that ""brick wall"" kind of aggravation.

You'll want walk slowly at one point, because at a certain point the hallway will transform into a room you've probably been to before if you don't jump, and that area in itself has a confusing layout, with invisible floors, rooms that  only allow access if you aren't looking at them as you enter, and areas that only exist if you enter them from the right doorway, not to mention many, many odd block puzzles.Antichamber probably gets a lot of comparisons to Portal, and for good reason. Both are puzzle games who rely on novel elements of level design and the ability to manipulate the environment to create what could be seen as a larger puzzle as a whole.However, Antichamber, focuses entirely on the latter. There is no antagonist, no threat of danger. The worst thing that may happen is you accidently boxing yourself in somewhere, and even that is an incredibly minor inconvenience due to your ability to return to any room you have visited from the main menu, which seconds as a sort of universal hub room.Also unique to this game is its sense of exploration. Antichamber is the best example I can think of as a puzzle-focused first-person Metroidvania-style game, where your only limitation in exploration are which tools you have collected. Oftentimes you will find yourself delightfully lost, as you rush forward only to find yourself back where you began. Antichamber is not about completing the labyrinth, it's about exploring it. Also, there's no David Bowie, pretty fantasy settings, or quirky puppets. But the ability to manipulate reality is a nice consolation prize."

It is very ground-breaking in the sense that a lot of the game mechanics are completely new. So as far as originality is concerned, Antichamber scores big. Unfortunately, the actually game playing experience does not quite live up to the originality of the design. The puzzles all involve progress from one room to another. There is no storyline to speak of other than ""inspirational posters"" that you encounter at each puzzle. For me the satisfaction of solving the puzzles would have been greater if there was an overall story. Also, it would have been better if some of the puzzles had been of a type where you do more than just figure out how to move from point A to point B. There are a few cases where it is hard to tell if you have really solved the puzzle. If there had been a kind of running score, or a little ""happy music"" when you solved a puzzle, this would have enhanced the game experience. There is no tutorial at all as to the rules and mechanics of the game, you figure this all out during the game. In some cases this makes the game more fun, since figuring out the game mechanics is part of the puzzle. In other cases, it is just plain frustrating, since there is a lot of trial and error to figure out how the game works. One big problem is the color coding system. There are parts of the game that you will encounter early on that are impossible to solve before you progress in other areas. You can waste a lot of time and become very frustrated before you figure this out. I still think this is a very good game and well worth your money. I would recommend starting with a strategy guide that explains the basics of the game mechanics and the color coding system, and how to use the map in the starting area. Don't spend too much time in any one puzzle, use the esc key to go back to the starting area and choose a new puzzle (color appropriate) before spending too much time on any one puzzle."

Unambiguous objects ensure you can always see every part of the puzzle.Intuitive mechanics: Once you understand a puzzle, completing it is easy: the mechanics are tight and easy to control.Not frustrating: a puzzle may force you to quit, but curiosity brings you back, wiser than before and filled with awe when you complete each puzzle.Non-linear level design: the path frequently splits and allows you freedom to take whichever path you want.Story: subtle, no cutscenes, all mechanically driven.Negatives:Art style may not appeal to everyone.Level design: while non linear (good), some paths are impossible to complete without completing other paths first.A great game exploring how the 3D world is boring, and always impressing you with new gimmicks and challenges, no two puzzles are identical."

Has some definite similarities to games like Portal and Quantum Conundrum, but there's enough different to stand off on its own.  You'll find it turning your brain inside out at how often you can literally turn around and find something different in front of you.  Many of the puzzle rooms seem outright impossible at the start of the game.  As you progress further and further, the solutions generally become obvious as you gradually learn more advanced methods to solve the puzzles (these methods usually come along at the same time as an upgrade to your cube gun).  The controls for moving the blocks from one spot to another can be a tad aggrivating when you're trying to move them around in 3D space rather than just inside the 2D puzzle sections.  That doesn't really detract at all from the overall game though.  Highly recommended if you are into games like Portal.  9/10"

Really the gun feels like a nice balance between portal and super metroid,- its nicely paced with amples amounts of mind ♥♥♥♥ery. Which I considered to be a big plus- and one of my favorite parts about the game were the placards spread throughout the game with sayings. It put into words a lot of what I think the developer was trying to say through the gameplay and created a sort of fugue between gameplay, puzzles and the placards. I feel this gave the game a sense of story progression. If there's a story then it's about the psychology involed in creating solutions to complex problems.This was my first experience with an indie game and I didn't expect so much emotion to be invovled but I continually got the feeling while playing that it was more than a game to the dev, that this was his baby and the love he has for it shows in the attention to detail. I really enjoyed playing such a finely crafted experience. The best part was that I sat down to play a game and by the end left inspired."

,Recommended,219890,5353493,"Posted: 5 March, 2013",all,ＫＡＹＯＭＮ,"Anti-Chamber is one of the very few puzzle games that I like. I'm a very fussy person when it comes to the purchase of game, but when I first looked at some gameplay, I immidiatly invested my money in it. The reason I found such enjoyment in playing this game is the simple fact that it breaks down the conventional walls that have been set up by puzzle games. What do I mean by this? Well, when you go to buy a puzzle game, you are expecting a grand amount of a ""find a way to exit this room"" which is what a lot of puzzle games have started doing now. I hate this style of puzzle solving with a pasion because the game will punish you until it forces you into it's specific mind-set, this is when it goes from challenging to tedious and annoying. This would usually be when I put down a puzzle game and never look or play it again. But Anti-chamber from the start gives you the whole game to explore off of the bat. If you can't solve the puzzle, you will find more doors to different places, and there is more than just one way of getting passed a part of the game. This, again, breaking down those walls built by the puzzle genre.As you progress through the world you will find little bits of philiosophical quotes at the begining and ending of a puzzle. This does get you thinking and some of them do contridict. This is the kind of thing that we need to see more of in video games, not some deep and yet completely meaningless story that tries to seem deep; but a game that reaches into things that people tend not to think of that often and put your brain to work, choosing which one you agree with more than the other. In all, Anti-Chamber is a good example of a game that really makes you think, without having a story. And because of this, it is all the better.At many points, the game speaks to the player and not the character. It often refers to ""you"" as the player, and not the thing that you are controlling, which is what a lot of games do, even if they don't inherently have a story with them. This shows how the game can really connect to the player, and furthermore push those philosophical questions to them. Because the character is not acting like a middleman, in fact the character isn't acting like anything. The game speaks directly to the player without the character in the game getting in the way and acting like a plot device for this information to be fed to. The game at many points will just say to you ""jump"" or ""run"" instead of something like ""Hey John, listen. I think it'd be a good idea to jump over that cavern.""Now, for the majority the game does a lot right. But there are a few traits of conventional puzzle games that it can't escape. For example, at one point during the game you gain some sort of device that can capture and shrink coloured blocks. While this is obviously to make the puzzles take longer to solve and incorporate a new challenge - which would of been fine - it seems as though it becomes the story. The game at one point, litterally becomes a bunch of puzzles that not only use, but require this device. Then you get to a point where you need to upgrade this device to be able to do different things, so you need to do a puzzle that enables you to progress further. To think that the game was doing so well up to this point I thought. This was the point where I'd usually switch off, but at this point I made myself continue to see the ending, which there wasn't really much of. But what do you expect from a game without a story. I'd be a hippocrite if I complained about that.Overall, I'd give this game a 8.6/10. Anti-Chamber was probably one of the first game from the puzzle genre that I've actually ever enjoyed playing and the philiosophical words of wisdom in the game really got me thinking. Unfortunately the score was marked down by the overexcessive use of the plotdevice-o-matic."

I rarely go for games like this, but i must say i did not regred my decision to buy this game. It is refreshing and intuative, the puzzle`s are sometimes ""mind bending"" lol , but still solvable (depending on how much you are relying on one way). The are also multiple way to get to the end what makes it possible for all Players to have different ways to the end and there for the first go through unique to everyone.The quotes and the use of the gun are brilliantly implemented and i must say i kinda got a taste now for games like this :)I just did only one playthrough, but will soon start another go just to see how fast i can get to the end of this game. It defenetly are replayability and is worth the money i spend on it.The style and the engine/gameplay make this game enjoyable, frustrating and a great journey for oneself.If you never tried a game like this, try this one.

Couched in small tidbits of life lessons are hints, clues, warnings, and yet more puzzles, and sometimes these helpful little lessons are the only roadsigns as to where you've just come from and where you're going, as the maps fold back and inward on themselves in ways that defy common sense.Ever seen Hypercube?

76561197960314247,Recommended,219890,7339288,"Posted: 8 October, 2013",all,Diablo_68,"AC is a game that will stretch your thought processes, arouse your curiosity, make you learn and above all else reward you when you put all those skills into practice. It will also most likely test your patience, punish you for not thinking outside the box and at times make you want to throw your PC out the window.AC is a FPS puzzle game close to the likes of portal but much more imaginative, you will find yourself in interactive connected world, actions you take will close or open routes and you are the rat in the maze. You will start looking closely at things and they might not seem what they first appear to be and sometimes just the action of looking at something might have unintended side effects.It is beautiful in its simplicity and yet there is a lot of depth to that simplicity that if you don’t pick up on will hold you back, some of the subtle parts really reward your curiosity and willingness to keep trying.You can’t die in this game, and often what you see as a failure to start with is actually a new approach to what you desire. You reveal the map as you go through corridors and rooms but as helpful as this is you also need to build a map in your own mind as a linear map does not reflect the reality you will find.There is no complete linear path from the start and you can wander to many different locations, you quickly start to realise a section that you are not ready for but you try and gleam some clue that could help you in your current state, it is nice that as you roam you almost get a sneaky peak at what is to come. It can also make the start quite challenging as you get disorientated and try to find what to do.When I first got the game, I played for an hour, scratched my head put it down and did not have much drive to pick it back up again, about six weeks later it was there looking at me in my Steam list and I thought you know what I will give it another go. A day and half later and two solid four hour sessions and I had completed the game and was now upset the ride had ended.I was happy with 8-9 hours of game time to complete to complete it especially with finding most of the secret sections along the way. AC makes you feel part of a secret world that the game designer made, it is almost like a sci-fi movie that you are playing a character in somebodies mind. Many of the secret sections you find are bits where the designer has shown you early concepts and you can see the years that the game must have taken to create.After finishing I was on Youtube and forums seeing how other people completed it and resolved many of the challenges in the game, I was surprised but not shocked when I saw a video showing someone complete the game in less than five minutes! As I said it does not have a linear path and this proves the point. The game is not about speed but how you go about the journey of the game and your own development in it.After the start of the game wandering around like an idiot you find near the end how you have learned and things that were so alien and unnatural become second nature.One of things I like about this game is that most of the challenges are thought exercises and once worked out you go through the motions to complete the challenge, unlike say times in Portal where you map out what to do in your head and then spend 15 minutes trying to time a portal correctly.Considering the many different aspects, the lack of a linear path and the ability to try and test so much out I only found two bugs, one was a simple restart of the game and it was resolved. One was a lot more infuriating as it was on one of the harder parts and a rare puzzle that required a bit of timing and skill to achieve. I had worked out how to do it and attempted it multiple times but it did not work, I then spent even longer trying to think even further outside the box until I eventually googled it and found it was quite a common bug, again a restart resolved the issue but the time lost was annoying.Overall I would say this game takes you on a wonderful journey, for me it was anger and annoyance that transitioned into intrigue and what felt like an expanding of my ability to view things in different ways.This is a love or hate game and you need to play it on one of those days where you feel a little whimsical and up for a challenge. One of the best games I have played and all credit to the designer. I got it on sale at 75% off and paid less £5.00 for it, I actually feel guilty about paying so little for such an amazing game."

There's nothing really Escherian about it (it's got to be all the weird stairs that make people say that). The geometry might as well be Euclidean (it's certainly locally euclidean, to use MATHS). The puzzles didn't feel particularly mind bending, which made all the signs about learning to overcome obstacles et al seem altogether patronising.It's got a fascinating design and was probably pretty mind bending to build though."

Secret rooms in the game also feature pieces of concept art and even museum like sections that showcase previous versions of the block gun you use, giving a greater appreciation of how much work was involved to create something like this.All this being said, it's still a short game with not a lot of re-playability value due to the nature of its design, so I'd say it's best to pick this up at a discounted price."

If you've played QUBE or Talos Principle, you should know what to expect here. The game has its couple of unique mechanics, and you'll use those to walk around and solve puzzles.The start of the game is very well done. It's confusing in a good way, and the novelty of the spatial tricks is fresh.Unfortunately as you proceed the puzzles start to become surprisingly mundane block placement puzzles. The strange world physics and the block placement almost never mix, which leads to an odd situation where you're walking through a bizarre world to solve completely ordinary puzzles. What makes these frustrating is that the controls feel sloppy -- it's difficult to position blocks in 3D space since you have no control over depth of your cursor.There are also a good amount of jumping block puzzles which are tedious at best.I got this game since the reviews were making it out to be something really extraordinary and groundbreaking. The game is neat, but it isn't much you haven't seen before and I don't think it's worth a $20 price tag.As a side note, this game gives me terrible motion sickness.

,Recommended,219890,16927163,"Posted: 7 July, 2015",all,Ithronyar,"Antichamber is a unique experience that challenges (and sometimes outright defies) conventional gaming logic. The majority of the game is set in a sprawling labyrinth of corridors, which usually don't quite follow the rules of 3-dimensional space. There were segments where I felt I was experiencing the fourth dimension, which was exhilarating and confusing in its own strange way.Early on, the game establishes its own fairly unique logic; that, combined with its unusual spatial properties, tells you that the game is not quite as mundane as first appearances might indicate. However, once you get used to Antichamber's special brand of reality, many of the puzzles are relatively straightforward (although you will still have to make a few unexpected solutions as you progress).The minimalist aesthetics make for stark visuals: Most of the game consists of blank monochromatic corridors, contrasted by occasional explosions of extremely saturated colors. There were even a few instances where I had to briefly shield my eyes from the sudden change of scenery. Overall, Antichamber has a minimalistic striking beauty about it, and the bright colors will be a welcome sight after you've been looking at white walls for a while.DESIGN/TECHNICAL ISSUESIt has some bugs and instability. The game is mostly solid, but you will almost inevitably encounter a few problems as you progress through the game. Fortunately, none of them are permanently game-breaking, and everything goes back to how they should be when the game is restarted.Crashing the game becomes fairly easy as your abilities progress later in the game; you can even cause a crash just by trying to solve various puzzles.In addition to instability, several puzzles can be permanently broken until you restart the game. These are probably the most infuriating bugs you can encounter, because it may not be immediately obvious that the game is broken; due to the game's inherently ""illogical"" puzzles, one might think a particular broken puzzle just requires a different solution to the obvious one. You can waste hours trying to solve it, only to slowly realize that it is, in fact, unsolvable.Fortunately, all broken puzzle woes are alleviated by a simple game restart, since the game world resets after every exit. It's mildly annoying, but it's better than having a permanently broken game save.While there is a fast-travel system in place, you'll be spending a lot of time running through corridors to get from point A to point B. This can quickly get boring, since most of the game consists of featureless white surfaces.You cannot crouch. Well, you can technically make yourself ""crouch"", but it involves placing cubes in your head until you get squashed into the floor. It is by no means an intuitive method, and it can get downright annoying if it doesn't work as intended (since it's basically a collision exploit, it's not exactly reliable). You might encounter multiple occasions throughout the game where crouching would be useful and perfectly reasonable, but there is no intuitive way to do so.There is no control rebinding menu. You have to dig into the game's configuration files to change the controls. Doing so is not particularly difficult, but it's not intuitive, and can waste far more time than decent in-game control rebinding.CONCLUSIONDespite its flaws, Antichamber is a refreshing, mildly psychological puzzle game that manages to not feel pretentious. I recommend it to anyone who likes puzzles, or simply wants a change of pace from most other games."

I love the concept of solving puzzles by figuring out the laws of the always changing realities within this game. But sometimes the puzzles are a bit phoned-in and feel out of place. When a good deal of the puzzles make you go ""a ha!"" and then some are puzzles you've seen before - which makes them extra disappointing, if you stack them up to the mind bending ones.The progression in this game isn't smooth at all. Maybe it's not meant to be. But I will say that your first hour of this game vs the rest of this game, are entirely different experiences. a joyful, steady progression, turns into a series of ""wtf""'s that result in a deeply satisfying feeling for having progressed. It's like sprinting then being forced to take baby steps. Keep in mind, that's my personal experience with it. and the thing with puzzle games is that progression is partially based on the players ability to solve the puzzles. But the more the antichamber opens up, the more I started dabbling in rooms here and there, figuring out where I should be going next.Very often, because of this, I'd be stuck on a puzzle, only to notice that a few rooms back (in a different direction than where I came from) there was a hint on how to solve it.... if only I had come through the ""correct"" route. But there is no correct route. Which made me learn that backtracking and approaching a room from another direction is far more beneficial than just.... trying to solve the puzzle. I just plain don't like that.Having said all that, I am enjoying this game a great deal. And will be pretty sad if/when I ever complete it. Because this game definitely has zero replay value (unless you arbitrarily want to complete it as fast as possible) as 90% of it's charm comes from initial impressions"

,Recommended,219890,15799789,"Posted: 12 May, 2015",all,The Maw,"Disclaimer. As with any review, this is my personal opinion of the game, so feel free to disagree. If you want a shorter, more focused review, then scroll to the bottom, as I have a more direct one there.ANTICHAMBERAntichamber was released on January 31, 2013 by indie game designer Alexander Bruce. The game is a first person puzzle game based around optical illusions, impossible shapes, and colorful movable blocks. The end goal is to escape the chamber you find yourself in, and along the way perhaps learn something about life from the assorted pictures that are scattered around the area. In my opinion the game was one of the best games of 2013, and remains one of my favorite games of all time.But why do I think Antichamber is so good? Well, as far as the gameplay goes, it’s a very well done game. The puzzles aren’t so hard that they make you want to just give up, but not easy enough so that you can breeze through, at least on your first try. The controls are simple enough, and are more or less what you’d expect. Space is jump, WASD are the directions, Shift is walk, and you use the mouse to move around and interact with certain objects. The game itself has a wide enough range of resolution settings, up to 1920x1200 down to 1024x768, so you can reliably run it without lag on most computers, but the most interesting part of the settings menu is where it is located. When you start up the game, you don’t get a menu screen, instead it just puts you in a small room, and on one of the walls is the settings menu. This makes it so you change your settings by looking at a wall, instead of in a menu like most games have you do.However, the wall with the settings on it isn’t the most interesting one, in my opinion that would be the wall to the left of the settings menu wall. This wall is blank when you start up the game, but as you progress through it slowly fills up with the pictures I mentioned previously. You find these picture on the walls as you travel through the chamber. Many of them are hints, others are insights into life. Some people might find them distracting, but I enjoy them, especially the artwork on each one. Each picture has a beautiful hand drawn image, as well as a sentence or two about something, depending on what it is.And this takes us to the next point. How good are the graphics in the game? Well, I’ve already said that I think that the drawings look amazing, but the rest of the game looks good as well. Not to the same degree, but it is fitting for the game. You will spend a decent amount of your time wandering down solid white corridors, but almost all of the puzzles themselves are a splendid blend of bright colors. And there is no shortage of challenging puzzles to be found. A perfect example is one of my favorite rooms, a room filled with boxes, each different face containing a different optical illusion, or impossible geometric shape, and each different shape or illusion is a beautiful blend of colors, some contain many brilliant shades of red, others hold lively blues and greens. And many of the faces change when you look away. One moment it can be bright red, but if you look away, it will quickly change to a dull yellow. The colors contrast wonderfully on the white backgrounds that permeates the games, which is most likely one of the reasons for it.Now comes the trickiest part. The plot. I think the plot is well done, but it’s hard to say why, because that would ruin the game. And that is one of the biggest problems with the game. The replay value is quite lacking, as it is with all puzzle games, and when you’ve solved it once, it becomes a walk in the park to replicate that feat. Another issue some have with the game, though it doesn’t bother me, is the fact that you can’t make multiple saves. For some, this is aggravating, but most have no problem with it. Just keep this in mind if you want to play separately, from say, a family member who uses the same computer, as you will have the save the files manually by going into the save data in the assets. Another issue is the lack of support for color deficient users. If you are color deficient I highly suggest that you do NOT pick this game up, as you will not get near as good an experience, and some of the puzzles may be rendered next to impossible, as with the movable colored blocks I mentioned much earlier. There is also an inability to rebind keys, which may detract from your enjoyment, though not immensely.Even so, despite the issues Antichamber has, if you are a fan of puzzle games, optical trickery, handcrafted artwork, or art in general, I highly suggest that you pick this game up and give it a try. You can find it on Steam for twenty dollars, and I think it is well worth the price.My name has been Allen Fierte, I thank you for reading this, and hope you have a nice day.RatingControls: (9/10) - A competent control scheme, but no key rebinding.Plot: (7/10) - A well done plot, but suffers from the same thing that many puzzle games do, a lack of replay value.Graphics: (8.5/10) - Personally I love the color scheme, but it’s not for everyone, and the graphics aren't the highest quality as the game was made by a small number of people.Audio: (7.5/10) - Not much to say about the audio, as there isn’t much to say. The music is nice, but it doesn’t really stand out, and there’s really no voice acting to speak of.Price: (6/10) [$20] - I love this game, and would pay twenty dollars no problem, but for some that may be a little pricey, for a game with so little replay value.Overall: (7.6/10) - I highly recommend this game, at least to play through once, as I think even that is worth it, but if you don’t have twenty dollars to spare, or don’t care much for philosophical art, then consider passing this game up."

The devil is in the details in how each game puts its own unique spin on that theme.It's difficult to put into words exactly what Antichamber is like, but that's one of the aspects of it that makes it so great. The best way to learn about it is to experience it for yourself. All you have to do is open doors and activate other things by placing blocks. Clues are given to you via riddles on black and white posters with charming little sketches. Sounds simple, right? It is very challenging at times, which is one of the criteria that every puzzle game enthusiast has for a good puzzle game.The graphics are minimalistic, and yet that never seems like a detriment to the game. If anything, it focuses the attention on the content of the puzzles. If the puzzles weren't that great, that would be a very bad thing. But the puzzles are very, very good. Some parts of the game are so clever they'll have you sitting back in your chair, laughing and shaking your head. I'm sure everyone who has ever played this game has said ""wow"" aloud at least once during their playthrough of it.The ""rooms"" of the game are very surreal. One element attributable to this is the incorporation of infinite loops: you can leave a room through a certain way and end up right back in that room. A word is never spoken during the game, and sometimes the only sound you will hear is the infernal tick-tocking of a swinging pendulum. Going back to the graphics, the lack of detailed texturing actually creates a very cool effect: the game isveryartistic. I've realized that you could take a screenshot of almostanywherein the game, and it would make for a pretty nice piece of artwork. How many games can you say that about?

This sign is saved on a wall in the hub and you may choose to reveal all of them, but they are all not required to beat the game.Antichamber has some of the most unique puzzles I have ever played. The actions are innovative and I enjoyed every bit of it. There is also zen ambience as you venture through the maze, which doesn't get me aggravated as I'm solving puzzles. It's the perfect puzzle mix. There are also guns which you can find in the maze that allow you to shoot blocks. These guns will help you navigate through the rooms. Some later guns have more useful abilities, and the last gun is required to reach the ending. Finally, my absolute favorite part about the game is the countdown timer. I was in the hub when the final seconds went down. Then I found a sign saying ""Live on your own watch, not on someone else's"". I had a good laugh with it as I was worried this whole game was on a time limit.I give this game 8/10. It's an innovative puzzle game with a relaxing atmosphere and abstract map design.

It does a good job of messing with your preconceived notions, which makes the moment you figure out a puzzle that much sweeter.The second half doesn't quite live up to the first half with some of the 'matter gun' puzzles getting a bit repetitive and not being quite as creative as many of the earlier puzzles. That is to say, what I liked about many of the earlier puzzles was being forced to use lateral thinking and push past my preconceptions, whereas the second-half puzzles tended to be a lot more about just having the right tools that followed pretty discrete behavior patterns.While many a fine puzzler is built on manipulation of predictable rules, the promise of the first half of a game that was completely about figuring out the rules set me up for slight disappointment.I did appreciate how the music started out simple and grew in complexity as the game continued.In addition, the pithy sayings on the signs don't quite have the impact of, for example, a snarky GlaDOS or the thoughtful philosophy and atmosphere of The Talos Principle.Please don't get me wrong. I still loved this game, and enjoyed both the first and second halves, it's just the game ended up merely 'very good' as opposed to 'outstanding'.8.5/10"

There is no story here other than what you put in it yourself. All logic and laws of physics that you would like to apply to the puzzles does not apply in this game... or well sometimes it does, but that's the fascinating part. Whenever you feel like you've figured out the game, it'll mess with your head in ways you will never see coming. But I found that it does so kindly.There's no right or wrong per se, just different approaches to the puzzles and different ways into different rooms. The whole thing is spiced up with some sort of motivational posters. At first I found that some of the posters were mocking my choices, but I slowly realized that they were just telling me that different choices lead to different outcomes. And that's sort of the most important aspect of the game. You might feel like you fail at some point, when you're in fact just going a different route.Anyway, I can definitely recommend the game if you want something that'll force you to think outside the box while solving greatly varied puzzles."

The design layout of the game is genius, you can always hop to another puzzle or section and see if there's something you have new tools to access that you didn't before.This means you almost never get stuck because if you can't figure something out, you hop to the next spot etc and there's always something somewhere you can progress in.Great minimalist atmosphere and no hand holding.

However, I was able to finish the game in a mere 4 hours. Now, there probably is a debatable replayability in this game, but for a game that is at $20, I don't recommend it.

Yes, you can retry the game multiple times in efforts for speedrunning, but if you just want the one and done deal, this game is too overpriced for it's contentHOWEVER, if you do see this game on a sale for maybe 7.50 or less, I would say give your wallet some relief and enjoyPost-script:I bought this game on a 75% discount, so this isn't a jealous review, just wanted to be honest with the amount of content.

This game is such an amazing experience and I thoroughly recommend it as I am about to play it for a third time. The overall experience is one that provides a thinking environment, amazing puzzles, almost philosophical ""tips"" or ""signs"" that give you small quotes and sentences that not only help with the game but with real life problems. Although this doesn't quite explain the game, I'll try to give a less vague explanation now. The game essentially starts you off in a black room that leads you to a plethura of extremely interesting rooms, each with its own puzzle. The game hasn't any real ""characters"" per se, but you can still feel a lot of emotion throughout the game. As the game progresses you begin to find new items that help you in your journey, and eventually bring you to a final puzzle that will test all that you learned throughout the game.TL; DR: This game is so amazing! 11/10 I promise it will be an experience you won't forget!"

,Recommended,219890,14903371,"Posted: 15 March, 2015",all,thewugs,"Antichamber is a fantastic example of what makes a puzzle game, but also a fantastic deconstruction of what makes a video game. We've become so used to certain things in modern games like dying, losing a level, how to navigate, and so on -- Antichamber takes all those expectations and turns them on their head. But it doesn't do so in a gimmicky way that makes the player feel cheated. Instead, there's a different set of physical rules that the game plays by, and the progression teaches you all of these things. Sometimes you might brute force your way through a puzzle without understanding it, but the comprehensive nature of the game means you'll probably encounter the puzzle again in a way that can't be brute forced.The very first thing you learn in Antichamber is that there's no losing state. The game is more or less a maze that can always be escaped with the press of a button. Usually you'll find yourself doing this when you're confused about a puzzle. The non-linear nature of the game allows you to reach a dead-end in terms of what you know how to do, but continue playing elsewhere, perhaps to discover what you didn't know, or find what you needed to progress. The most famous aspect of this game is the non-Euclidian space, where returning to a previous area might not bring you to where you were before. The game also gently introduces you to these concepts, and you'll surprise yourself with how second-nature they become by the end of the game.The art style and presentation of this game is intentionally extremely simple. You can feel it in the sound design, in the visuals, in the movement, and in pretty much every other aspect of the game. It's for that reason that I'm not at all upset about the lack of story; having an actual character would break the flow of the game. There's no explanation for who or what or where you are, and I'm fine with that because this is a game for the sole sake of it being a game."

It  will make you feel very clever when you overcome an obstacle... and very dumb when you are stuck.  I can't say much about this game because spoilers of any kind would ruin it.  You're better off playing it with as little information as possible (if you get stuck DON'T CHEAT just walk away and return to the game later).  My two major concerns about this game: little to no replay value (it is a maze-puzzle game that doesn't change; beat it once and you're done unless you want to do a speed run),  it is a little short (approx 8 hours of gameplay although some will take longer than others).  Both of these issues will be fixed if this ever gets added to Steam Worshop. I'd love to see this game get some user-created content."

The greatest moments are when I am forced to deliberately drop what I think I know, start from scratch, and see everything with new eyes.If you think of games as art, then this is a masterpiece of minimalism, speaking volumes with a paucity of elements.

The atmosphere and aesthetic start out good and continually grow on you throughout the game. The easter eggs are amazing, and each provides a unique type of behind-the-scenes info about the game while maintaining immersion.But what really shines about this game is that it's responsible. The advancement points are put behind more difficult puzzles in more obscure areas of the map. You really have to go looking for them, and the game motivates you to do so by making visible the paths that are obstructed with impossible puzzles. The game builds desire, and then rewards you at a responsible pace. That combined with the life advice actually makes the whole experience emotional.I would buy this game again.

Any preconceived notion you have about how a game should work will only hinder your progress - Antichamber has its own rules, and even those rules are subject to change. It's rare that a game makes me think about its mechanics in such depth - Portal and Fez are two others that come to mind - but Antichamber makes you analyze and puzzle harder than those games.Did you see that movie Cube or its sequel? Antichamber is kind of like that, but you can't die. There's no failure in this game - just delay and redirection as you try to make sense of its reality. It's like being caught in an M. C.

The game's non-Euclidean space/geometry often means conventional logic won't work, and you'll often have to ""think outside the box"" in order to solve a room (or find a different exit to a room you previously solved). Additionally, part of the fun of Antichamber is just trying to figure out what the goal of the game is.I enjoyed the game very much and believe it is one of the best games of the year.  I would absolutely recommend it to a friend, especially if that friend enjoyed Portal.PROS:-The game is fun and each room has a unique puzzle or trick to it.-Non-linear design means if you get stuck you can try a different direction/room.-The puzzles struck a good difficultly balance and were difficult but not impossible to figure out on my own.-The game is completely non-violent and is ideal for casual gamers, children, and those normally turned off by video games due to violence.CONS:-The game is single-player only.-The story is minimal.-The game has little replayability because the puzzles are set.

First few times the game didn't work for me, it just hung there doing nothing at a white screen.  I let it sit for the weekend in my games queue.  So today I tried it again and now it works!  Whatever???  Then the game load up the first room. I could use my mouse to look around, then a second later I had to hold the right mouse button down to look around.  Weird!Once I figured out how to get out of the first menu room, yes, the first room consists of menu options and other weird stuff on the walls, I then stepped through a door that I could not step through a minute ago.  Now not to ruin the game, but all is not what it seems inside of the Antichanber and you MUST think outside of the box or you'll end up back in the menu room!  Sort of...  That is when I quit and started writing this.  As I said, the game did not work for me the first few times I tried it, so if that happens to you, let it sit for a day or two, then try it again...

There's a room that was never finished, the pink blocks don't do anything, and many rooms and secrets are underutilized. I don't know why that is, but maybe, it could be considered retroactively as a distraction, even if they were meant to be something before. The end goal has to do with that black non-Euclidean ""cube.""The gameplay itself is flawless and straightforward. The puzzles, however, are simply not always decipherable even after several location resets, and this is a good thing - it gives it tons of replay value. It also chains these lil ♥♥♥♥ers. Puzzles branch off into different puzzles, and much of it depends on where you start, because that will determine how many placeable cubes you can harvest. Some areas will also change if you've completed them before (but not that much).I have one big piece of advice for you: Learn to sequence break, and love it. (HardcoreMetroidplayers, of both 2D and 3D games, know what I'm talking about). If you like to play by your own rules, learn to break those. At times, you can use either method, but other times, you will be sorely stuck with one or the other. Some puzzles absolutely require you to pull some wild stunts, and some require gratuitous patience and good timing.Regardless, it's dual-nature makes it an A+ puzzle game, outclassing most in it's genre. While it's mechanics cannot be compared to other games because of their differences,Antichamber'suse of said mechanics is something else.It's a damn shame it wasn't finished.

Some optional parts that lead to little nuggets of the game that don't do anything to further the game's progress, lead you through fruitless rabbit holes because you never know if it is optional until after you finish the puzzle. If you enjoy portal, platformers, puzzles, or any combination of those things you shall enjoy this game for every minute you play, and the playthrough time may have been 8.1 hours for me, but it could range wildly from 15 minutes to 40 hours all depending on the player. Though it is said 8 is an average and you only can do it in 15 minutes if you already beat it once. Do not spoil anything for this game with walkthroughs, everything is doable with no knowledge of how to do it thanks. Just take s step back and view all the angles of it. Also always read room names and the signs as they can give you clues as to what you must do everytime. This game brought on the fear of the unknown in me, always afraid to go foward because I never knew what possibilities were ahead, but in the end the fear is just what made completing this intricate love of labour puzzle game. I applaud the developers for going all the way and for saying when others said it was complete that it is no where near completion for release over and over.

As far as the Portal comparison, what was a portal gun is now a minecraft-style block pickup, placer, and mover gun, what were deadly lasers are now just sensor lasers that have to be blocked and avoided, what were turrets are now nothing. No death, you just end up in another room you don't know how it could have connected to the one you were just in, or get stuck and have to return to the hub. Another notable thing are the notes you'll find on the wall.

There is SOME similar aspects between them although, Antichamber screws up with you a lot more than the friendly user Portal.Antichamber is a stunningly beautiful puzzle game and another deep, original indie title, with a lot of character. If you love the genre, you cannot miss it.PROS:+Stunning artworks and visuals.+Soothing ambiant soundtrack.+Challenging puzzles!+Very trippy! Don't play this game if you ""took something""... that game will send you into another dimension and the trip will be at your own risk!CONS:-Story is very lacking (heck, I'd even say there isn't any story, sadly).-Can be frustrating at times (game can be cruel enough at when you just cracked a hard puzzle and you turn around, you are warped into a starting area. So you have to redo other puzzles in order to progress to where you were... it is irritating!).OVERALL:Still, even if I was annoyed at parts in the game, Antichamber proves to be a challenging, smart, entertaining and extremely immersive game. It takes from known first person puzzler and goes into a complete innovative direction. It is like Portal boosted on steroids and LSD at the same time... trippy, yet challenging too! A unique experience is to be had for sure!RECOMMENDATION:For those who love puzzlers, put on your wishlist and get once in sale!RATING:8.0 / 10PS: I'm quite positive Walter Bishop from Fringe TV show would recommend playing this game if you're out of LSD!"

It's combat system is intuitive, the battles are envigorating, the storyline is majestic, except...there isn't any of those.They're practically nonexistent.There is no combat, enemies, characters, story, or even damage.Then why did I recommend this game?For that exact same reason.Antichamber ReviewAntichamber is, in it's entirety, a mind game. Not a puzzle game, a mind game. It takes what you know about normal First-person exploration games...then flips it on it's head. Hallways will change when you look away, walkways will spontaneusly appear underneath your feet, walls will dissappear as soon as you step toward them, and rooms will change by the simple act of looking through a window.Antichamber is a mind game.You start off in a large, black room with the only useful information being how to move, look around, and interact with things. That's the only straightforward information the game will EVER directly give you. Everything else is found through discovery.If this sounds much too mind-boggling for you, have no fear, there are little hints left for you throughout the game. For example, let's say you come to what looks like a dead end. A normal person would just turn away, assuming there is nothing to be found here. Instead, there will be a sign that says ""sometimes the easiest path is straight forward,"" implying that you should walk straight through the wall. Alas, when you walk toward the wall, it dissappears and you move on forward.The VerdictAntichamber is a fun and somewhat humerous way to mess with your head, but can be a little confusing at times.Antichamber - 8.5/10"

The developer's artful use of deep and thoughtful puzzles opened my eyes to the human condition.I'm joking. Antichamber is only one of the things I mentioned, and that is a puzzle game. Like some people have mentioned, it's easy to look at it and say ""oh, a portal knockoff"", but the truth of the matter is that it's a bit more complex than that, and by a bit, I mean much. Instead of exploring the ""what if"" of making a tunnel between anywhere, Antichamber explores the ""what if"" of walking through a door and not being where you came in from if you walk back out of it.The puzzles are rarely ever given to you straightforward. The game relies on the player paying attention to their surroundings on a completely different level. It isn't too dificult to figure out the right answer, and you feel really rewarded when you maange it. My one gripe is that after every puzzle, the game gives you a sort of cryptic hint, but typically, this hint is for the puzzle you just figured out on your own.Overall, if you're the kind of person who loved fooling around in Portal/Portal 2 trying to break the tests to see if you could sneak into somewhere you don't think you were intended to be, or tried to drag a cube into another test chamber, you'll be pleasantly surprised to know that Antichamber encourages that sort of thinking, and in fact, the game outright requires you to ""break"" its puzzles.

The unusual geometry and interesting soundscape mess with your head, in a way that's both confusing and relaxing in a strange way. You might play Antichamber, but goddamn if the game doesn't also play you along the way.Gameplay: As a puzzle game, the gameplay is what draws you in and keeps you there. I'd give Antichamber's unique style a8/10. This isn't the type of game that is very conducive to binge-playing. It's much better to take breaks and come back with a fresh mind.Graphics/Visual Experience: Antichamber's visual simplicity does it justice. With the graphics limited by the puzzling geometry of the game, there's very little that will blow you away except to make you say ""Wow, they've implemented that puzzle pretty well.""7.5/10, as with certain graphics settings it can certain tax the eyes after a while.Sound: To call Antichamber's soundscape a ""soundtrack"" isn't quite accurate. It's quite atmospheric and ambient. Not so much as to become background noise, but never so prominent that it draws your mind away from the puzzle you're trying to solve.8/10Replayability: As mentioned earlier, it's a not a game that's conducive to binge play. It's best played in short bursts. In that regard, you'll be coming back often. However, the puzzles are designed, not generated, so the game does have an ending. However, it's not an easy game. You really have to take your time with this one. With the length of the game, I'd be surprised to see if you actually remember the path through the earlier puzzles by the end.7.75/10How it Runs: It's not a very demanding game at all.

Some puzzles are more stubborn than others and using google can get you over a problem. The path of least resistance is a valid option and there's nothing wrong with taking shortcuts, but rushing through the game won't give the right result. Too much curiosity can get the best of us, but patience has it's own rewards. This game isn't about getting to the end. Failing to succeed does not mean you fail to progress. The further you explore, the more connected everything becomes and if you dig a little deeper, you may find something new about yourself.

However, to call it art may not be granting enough credence to its gameplay. It is well built, well controlled, well designed, and overall, simply well done. It is imaginative, communicative without force, subtley enthusiastic, thematic, entertaining, appropriately complex, pleasingly challenging, and a host of other positive things that are too numerous to list.If you like puzzles, or exploration, or art, or anything even remotely resembling those things, play this.

At a basic level, this game is a puzzle-platformer, however I would akin it more to an ""Alice in Wonderland-esque"" adventure game like Myst. If you've ever played Myst or its sequels you know the familiar feeling of being stuck at a dead-end. Being stuck in Antichamber isn't not knowing how to solve a puzzle, it's not knowing where the next puzzle is at all. There are several moments in the game where you will have exhausted all possible tricks, codes, doors, and rooms that you can think of and you resort to wandering aimlessly throughout the map clicking on everything hoping to find where the next puzzle element is. The obvious problem with this is that it's not fun. However, when you do know where the puzzles are, it is a joy to work out the difficult, often nonsensical answers and make progress. So, buy at your own risk."

The goal in Antichamber is to find ways to break these paradoxies and eventually move on to other interesting puzzles.

It goes well beyond a typical puzzle game, drawing the player slowly into the alternate logic of its universe. Only very occasionally did it demand a tricky (to me) bit of eye-hand coordination. Upon solving a puzzle I never felt that sense of frustration one sometimes feels when a solution demands something absurd or that the player couldn't reasonably guess. Everything can be solved by experimenting to learn how things work and then utilizing the principles.If I had to say something let me down, it's probably that I felt it didn't resolve in a narrative sense. Being faced with this alien world, with different rules and a sort of iconic tale being told in parallel, I was constantly trying to put together the larger ""story"" or concept. While there was a clear transistion into the conclusion, and while the actual ending was beautiful and gave me a primitive sense of closure just as a sort of transcendent spectacle, it didn't connect to a meaning as augured by the icons, etc. That may well be part of the point, and I respect that, but that lack of resolution is the one thing I wish could be different. Well, and of course, I wish there were more wonderful puzzles!I recommend this, I have purchased it as a gift for others, and I look forward to more from the author."
,Recommended,219890,11922603,"Posted: 30 August, 2014",all,Pogo,"Antichamber is a great puzzle-based non-combat FPS game. It's a game that requires you to accept that while the world does not follow the rules you already know, there is always logic that can get you where you need to go.Some of the puzzles involve your perspective or your movement, but most of them involve finding and using the matter gun.The matter gun begins with the ability to pick up and put down small colored blocks, necessary to activate switches, prop doors open, and even build platforms. As you progress through the game, you will be able to upgrade the gun to manipulate the blocks in additionals ways, which in turn allow you to solve more advanced puzzles  on your way to the exit.While the ""essential"" doors need to be completed in order with corresponding gun upgrades, the game is actually somewhat open in allowing you to explore and solve less-important puzzles and unlock new areas. Most of the puzzles are not required in order to reach the end, but many of them serve to teach you how the world works and how to use your gun (once you find it). Scattered throughout the entire game are over 100 posters to find. Some are hidden, some are out in the open. The posters feature a simple illustration and life lesson, which often ties to the puzzle at hand in some way. The posters add an optional collection factor for obsessive completionists.There is no real danger to your character. You survive falls of any distance, but since much of your progress is upward, you may still be frustrated to find that you fell down to an area  you've already solved and may now have to waste time catching up.The starting area functions as a hub room, keeping track of which posters you've found and providing a map of areas you've visited. You can always warp back to the hub room if you get stuck, and you can use the map to warp to an area you've seen, so it allows for quicker travel in the late game.Out of all the games I've played this past year, Antichamber is one of my favorites. I'd recommend this for anybody who likes the puzzle solving aspect of Portal games, though it doesn't have the same atmosphere and snarky comedy."

It's easily equal in stature with Portal in my mind. The way you learn mechanics is incredibly organic, and there are no artificial barriers to your progress - if you can figure out the final puzzle without completing the rest of the rooms, you progress to the finale. While the ending was rather silly, the rest of the game is joy to play, and the a-ha moments make the experience incredibly gratifying. In addition, the games lasts just about as long as it needs to; there's a really solid base of content here without any filler."

It certainly makes you think, but I think the biggest difficulty is that because it is so intentionally confusing at times, it's very easy to forget where you have and have not been.  Therefore I would recommend playing it in as connected a series of sessions as possible.  If you want to complete 100%, as my personality compelled me to do (!), then you will have a hard time ""tying up loose ends"" if you leave it too long, finding yourself _rediscovering_ the same exits from puzzle rooms that you have already completed and wasting a little time - which started to make me feel a bit bored.I actually have a hard time knowing whether to recommend this game or not.  It's fun, and satisfying, but also pointless and infuriating.  A lot of the puzzles require _discovery_, and that can sometimes mean the dreaded ""wandering round rooms not knowing what to do"".  Sometimes you feel like you have to find the puzzle before you can actually solve it!My guess is that some people will love Antichamber and some will hate it.

While this game's objective, solve puzzles to find a way out of the maze you are in, is simple, that is the only straightforward thing about this game.  Antichamber has a logic of its own when it comes to puzzles.  Pathways can loop around into themselves, going back may lead to areas you haven't seen before, and merely looking or not looking at something can change the result between success or failure.Fortunately, it's surprisingly intuitive, and a handy map viewable from the initial room (which you can teleport to at any time,) helps immensely in keeping track of your progress through the labyrinth.  The puzzles themselves are pretty fun, with an engaging atmosphere that draws you in, and are highly rewarding when you work out the solution.The only downsides are that the game is pretty short and that once the puzzles are solved, there isn't much else to do.  Even so, Antichamber is a unique experience that should be played by any puzzle enthusiast."

The sound effects are great, never getting in the way, being relaxing and calling your attention when necessary with sounds such as birds flying around or the wind blowing. At first the game looks nonsense, with floors vanishing right beneath your feet or entire rooms desapearing as you turn you back to it, but as soon as you get the hang of the rules, keep focused and use all the help you are provided with, it all flows at a very good pace.

While it isn't Portal, nothing is, and this is probably the closest approximation I've seen. Possible downsides/where it fails in comparison: There's no humor, and the world is more open-ended, leading to some amount of ""where is the next area"", and the platforming component is higher than it is with Portal (and occasionally annoying, although I believe there are better ways of doing some of the things I found annoying?). But it has interesting gimmicks and reasonable puzzles, and nothing was over-the-top annoying."

Worth the money I paid for it and would purchase any DLC or sequels if they were ever made.It's similar to Portal and Portal 2 in that it is a first person puzzle game but the experience between the games are completely different. It's probably due to the lack of story and interactivity with any other characters in Antichamber but that doesn't make the experience any less worth while.The game should last you between 4-8 hours depending on how fast you pick up solving puzzles.

Then, when they sober up the next day, there's a hint of remorse as they patch over it with a few words of inspiration on the walls.To be fair, their minimalistic game design it expertly crafted, to bring highly innovative challenges which really make you think. Much is based on perception and pre-conceptions. You may wander down a hallway, stop and turn around, only to find that the way you came has totally changed. You may also look a little closer through a viewing window, step back, and find yourself transported into a different room. This is all completely seamless, which messes with your head that much more.This game teaches you that trying something new will be rewarding. It almost always knows which way you'll tackle a challenge first, then give you one of many reassuring messages alluding to the task, or life in general. It gives you motivation to try and try again, in different ways.And you will want to, because finally overcoming a challenge that left you stuck for ages, makes you feel likethe smartest man alive!I will admit that I sometimes asked for help from a gamer friend smarter than I, but I implore you to hold out on walkthroughs for as long as possible. It would ruin the rush of completing the harder puzzles.The lack of story and strange ending might remove you from being enveloped in the experience, but that's not what it's all about. It's about overcoming bizarre and difficult puzzles not like any other game out there.7/10"

However, they're signs throughout that give you hints at what to do, without spelling it out for you. They're clear enough that you'll usally figure it out after a time or two, if not immeditatly.At first, you don't have any tools, all you can do it figure out the puzzles and tricks by using the signs, and trying something you haven't tried before. Early in the game, there's a hole that you simply fall into. At the botton, there's a sign that hints at trying to simplywalkacross the hole, and lo and behold, it works. That's the kind of hints you can expect. Eventually, you get a gun of shorts that can pick up, store, and shoot small blocks that you can use to your advantage, to do things such as keeping doors from closing, and to get up smalls your normally can't jump up.The main menu for the game is different. You're in a closed room, with a door marked 'exit' behind a pane of glass. You can walk around the room, and use one wall that has a map of sorts on it to go anywhere within the chamber you've been before, allowing you start from anywhere after going to the main menu. Due to this setup, there isn't a hard save option to speak of, which bothers me in a way (Whenever a game doesn't have a manual save option, it bugs me and makes me nervous; I like to have more control over the game if I ♥♥♥♥ something up).Overall, I'd recommend it with a 7.5/10. It's a nice game, made well, and totally ♥♥♥♥s with your mind, but it just isn't the kind of game that hits squarely with me. If it's on sale, grab it. If not, I'd wait until it is."

It is a game for Escher fans, a game of exploration and unlearning and relearning rules.If you feel like you want to enter and explore a realm that has no basic laws of physics, or a game that is stunning to discover and entices you to explore it, or even just a game that forces you to change conventions and take a hard look at how and why certain, VERY logical things are designed, then you my friend have very perculiar tastes. Also, this game is for you.I wouldn't say this is worth $20 or $15 dollars, tho. I would say it's more of a $10 game. Plus, I have run into some issues that crashes the game (really late game, tho).

Hearing people give examples of all the crazy and awesome things this game does may help you make an educated decision on buying it, but it'll cheapen the experience in the end.On that note, I'll just list a few things you'd want to know as a buyer: It's a very creative and unique puzzle game, played in a non-linear Metroid-esque kind of way. My first playthrough lasted around 6 to 8 hours, but it varies depending on how much of it you explore. It doesn't have much replay value in the puzzles - they're of a sort where once you solve it once, you can quickly and easily solve it again. I personally thought the experience made up for the lack of replay value.That's all I'll say. If you have to know more, I wouldn't recommend it to you. If you like puzzles and don't mind taking a risk on a game purchase, stop doing research on it and buy it."
