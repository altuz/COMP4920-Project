,Recommended,219950,17621026,"Posted: 19 August, 2015",all,cdgamer97,"One of the greatest games of all time. NiGHTS definitely deserves a little more recognition for the beauty and creativity of the game. Controls are easy to learn, and I'll often find myself playing for hours at a time trying to beat my old scores or just releasing steam with a boss run. The characters are colorful, easy to love, and full of personality! This is a feel-good game!I'll be honest, the first time I saw NiGHTS as a young gamer raised on Nintendo consoles, it was in the NiGHTS into Dreams pinball table alongside Sonic in Sonic Pinball Party for the GameBoy Advance. Needless to say, having just recently been introduced to Sonic, and having a mindset that most girls didn't play videogames, NiGHTS appeared to me as SEGA's lady-Sonic character... the feminine colors of pink and purple hadn't always appealed to me.Many years later, revisting some of my older games, I picked up Sonic Pinball again, and I thought to myself: ""I remember the NiGHTS table having something the Sonic one didn't: Bosses! You're older and much more skilled now, so why don't we give this a go?"" After a few practice rounds, I'd cleared my way through all 6 tables, their Nightmaren bosses, and eventually unlocking the secret NiGHTS ""Twin Seeds"" table, which led to my first encounter with (and triumph over) Wizeman the Wicked.I was hooked. I wanted to learn about the REAL NiGHTS. After finding very few videos on Youtube over the original NiGHTS into Dreams, I did my own research, and found the game was available on Steam for just $10. At this point in time, I didn't have a Steam account, nor was I interested in TF2 or Garry's Mod, Counter-Strike, any of these legendary titles I'd seen friends playing in the past.That's right:The whole reason I made a Steam account was for NiGHTS.So the next time you see me on your team in TF2, or the next time you see me post a Garry's Mod animation, you can thank the whimsical dream-jester, and the geniuses who've brought it to life."

The good news though its very smooth and fluid and stays true to the original Sega Saturn game. The only complain that I have is that in Sega Saturn Mode- the game is not a true emulation - its a remake using texture mapping without filtering - nothing more. I guess Saturn Emulation is hard to achieve. While there are many emulators out there they require a high system requirement and even at that you don't get accurate results. Nonetheless though , if you want a trip down memory lane , its here for you , but if you know how to beat the Sega Saturn game, you will finish this in mere moments......"

There's also no tutorial so expect to be totally confused when you first start, I certainly was :). A 360 controller is recommended.While you're at it you should buy Journey of Dreams which is almost as awesome as this."
,Recommended,219950,9755822,"Posted: 7 April, 2014",all,Jammerlee,"Having been a fan of NiGHTS since its original release back on the Sega Saturn, I can tell you a LOT of love went into this port. In addition to the original game itself, included also is the rare and coveted demo disc Christmas NiGHTS, opening up unlockables and a varient of Spring Valley primarily centered around Christmas (though the theme sometimes changes depending on the holiday/date, such as April Fools, Halloween, summer, Valentines, etc). This alone makes this port worth it to the die-hard fan, but on top of this, you've given the option to switch between the original Sega Saturn graphics, or the graphics of the formally Japan-only PS2 remake.For those of you unfamiliar with this title, you can choose between to play as either Claris or Elliot, two children whom by day struggle to overcome their fears, and by night aid NiGHTS in overthrowing the king of all Nightmare, Wizeman. As you fly through linear circular stages, you'll collect orbs and other goodies, destroying captures that hold Ideya - raw dream energy - that had been stolen from the two children. Its story is left intentionally vague to encourage the player's own imagination to interpret the events. There are also many goodies and easter eggs to be found hidden around, including the curious Nightopian AI (these being creatures that breed, grow, die and can even hybridize with enemies within the level). At the time of its original release this game offered groundbreaking techniques in graphics and gameplay style, giving it its own place in history and recognized by many as an unofficial secondary mascot to Sonic Team.And now for the downside. Unfortunately, the game is incredibly short and can be 100%'d in only a few hours, though the extras help to provide some replay value. Also, while the controls, for the most part, are pretty tight there are areas where NiGHTS becomes difficult to control - particularly areas like the bobsled, mermaid and rail portions from their respective levels.Still, despite those problems, for the price and what it comes with, I would consider it well worth it and highly recommend it to anyone interested in a timeless masterpiece and a piece of gaming history. If you're still unsure, I would say to consider waiting for a sale. Either way, NiGHTS into Dreams is well worth having in your collection."
,Recommended,219950,32051356,Posted: 29 May,all,insanity of a manatee,"(this is the first time i've played this game)NiGHTS into Dreams is a beautiful game. There's just something about flying around as NiGHTS that just feels so... good. Collecting those orb things, making loops with the ribbons... it's just really nice.That being said, there are some issues with the game itself.Firstly, the lack of tutorial. I'm playing this with a keyboard (no other alternative), and I spent 10 minutes working out how to move and attack. It just dumps you onto the menu. No opening cutscene, not even a bit of dialouge, no explanation as to what you're supposed to even do in the levels. I know this game is supposed to be vauge, but c'mon! At least explain the controls!Secondly (and I know this was probably due to the programming limitations at the time and the fact that 3D games were kinda a new thing in the original verson), the animation of the two children is just kinda... ridiculous. It looks really weird. I'm playing the re-mastered version, and I dunno, it just kinda irks me that they didn't even bother to make it look less derpy.Finally, the boss fights. No explanation as to HOW you're supposed to defeat them - again, I get the game wants you to figure out this stuff by yourself, but with an extremely tight time limit and no explanation, it just frustrates me that you have to restart the entire freakin' level if you run out of time.Also the time limits but that's because I'm the kind of person who completely forgets about objectives and always gets lost and distracted by beautiful maps.Anyway, that over, this game is... an experience. Even with all my issues around it, I still highly recommend it. It's just the feeling of flying around in a crazy dream world that I've never experienced in any other game.Lastly, I think it'd be better played with a controller (as it was designed for a console), and I would recommend for first time players to look up a guide to familiarize themselves with the controls before starting if they wanted to."

As for the graphical update, it's gorgeous! It may only run at 30fps (it's a smooth 30 though so I let it slide) but it is so nice on the eyes. Now the gameplay is, in my opinion, extremely well done. I can fly around with my Xbox 360 controller (which is so comfy with this game) and do anything I want (yes there's a time limit but I have yet to run out of time). The main objective is to collect 20 Blue Chips and go to the Ideya Capture, once there you obtain an Ideya. You then place it into a temple structure thingy, but make sure you spend almost all your time collecting as many points as possible before returning to the temple. All the bosses have a strategy to beat them quickly and gain the highest multiplier. Music? It's so memorable! I've only played for a few hours and I can already name which track belongs to any stage! Total time to complete? I beat it in less that 2 hours, but I still want to keep playing it. Difficulty? It's easy but getting all A's takes skill. Easter eggs? I will hint one, set your computer clock to April first and play Claris' first stage. All and all I loved my experience with the game and can easily recommend this to anyone looking for a good time."

,Recommended,219950,30436350,Posted: 10 March,all,[LUE] TormakSaber,"Only two hours in the steam version, but I put hundreds of hours into the game on the Saturn. The game is a huge nostalgia rush for me in every meaning of the word.NiGHTS is a whimsical game about flying through rings, collecting orbs, and comboing up a massive high score, set against a backdrop story of dreams and nightmares, and two children learning about life and growing up and overcomnig fears and challenges in the real world, while defending a dreamscape from the evil 'Wizeman', who is stealing dream eenrgy and hope from sleeping children, causing nightmares and fear. The titular character, NiGHTS, represents the growing maturity and overcoming challenges the children face, as the levels go from lighthearted and bright, to dense night time cities, arid deserts, and cacophanous carnivals. Each stage is concluded by fighting one of the great Nightmare bosses, all of whom have unique ways of fighting them and present their own time attack challenges to affect your score.While the game itself is very short, it can be replayed for score, which is an impresive thing to do that relies on heavy knowledge of all the levels, how to best use the kids at the beginning of the level, and knowing exactly how far you can push extra stage laps to squeeze as much time as possible out of the bonus sections. Every level can also be interacted with in a number of dfferent ways and have various paths you can take through the sublevels. The music will change and alter itself based on how you interact with the non-hostile Nightopian angels, and the Nightmaren monsters around the levels, including breeding them into small hybrids. Nightopians would later go on to become the absis for Chao in the later Sonic Adventure games, as well, giving the system even more longevity.The music is top notch and memorable on every single stage, and the opening and ending songs are songs I can still hum along to by heart even years later with a decade and more gap between the last time I'd heard the song.As a port it's wonderfully done, and the game lets you choose between the original Saturn graphics, or redone HD graphics from a JP-only PS2 port. The game also includes Christmas NiGHTS, which is a tiny essentially demo version of the game set to various holiday themes that, while defaulting to Christmas, while change based on the date clock of your computer for things like Halloween and Apirl Fool's Day.A pure trip through nostalgia, and a wonderful game that deserved much more than just a single sequel on the Wii.."

This game is rather short. However...This specific version includes the original game, a graphically remastered version, Christmas NiGHTS, and a ton of unlockables, all of which is only $10. I don't know about you, but all of that for only $10 is quite honestly a steal!So overall, while it might not be for everyone, but for what it is, it does it's job very well.

But then I actually got to playing it. According to various sects of the internet, this game hasn't stood the test of time, and the only fans are nostalgic 90s kids who played the game when they were young kids. So in 2016, as a late teen playing the game for the first time ever, I can safely say this is one of the best games I've ever played. The game's atmosphere is perfect, the gameplay is simple but fun, the levels are very replayable, the soundtrack is great, and the simple but charming narrative tells a story without a single word. And even though the game is kinda short and the character models are a bit... dated, this is still a great game I'd recommend to anybody who wants a more unique experience or a refreshing break from modern gaming cliches."

NiGHTS HD recreates the Sega Saturn classic with the addition of a theater mode and art gallery, plus the Christmas NiGHTS extra story.GameplayThe game ultimately boils down to speed runs. There are 7 stages in total and the aim is to rack up the highest score by chaining links, combos and performing acrobatic stunts, all the while collecting dream energy to unlock special dream energy and returning it to the checkpoint. The game can be a little tricky to figure out at first but once you learn the patterns, you will have fun flying through the levels at high speed. My only concern is the controls doesn't quite have the same finese that the original has, but I am using an Xbox360 Controller. I would like to try this game with Steam's own controller.There is also the option to explore the worlds a little and admire their design, however if you take too long the game pushes you to complete the level. This isn't a bad thing as afterall you are in a dreamworld.DesignA game that was developed in 1996 still stands as having some of the most imaginateive landscapes and character designs. Each level is a representation of the characters emotions and the challenges they must overcome in real life, The levels are bright and colourful and you often spot something you never noticed the last time you played the level. After the wonderful dream levels are the darker boss nightmare stages which contrast the adventure levels. The boss levels just feel like a nightmare and give you the sence of dread.The HD textures and character models are really good, and there is an option to play in Saturn mode, with the low poly models. Unfortunately the Saturn mode also reduces the screen to it's original 6:4 format.VerdictWhile the game is excellent, and it has all the charm of it's original. I still find myself wanting to play the original. However, I still highly recommend this game to anyone looking for a quick game to pick up and play a few rounds after coming home from school or work. You are looking at maybe 5 hours worth of Gameplay if you want to get all the achievements,I bought the game at £9.99 and I fully entend to play this game for years to come."
,Recommended,219950,29187086,Posted: 11 January,all,IncomingPixels,"Never in my life have i played something so whimsical. Though now a pretty old game, (roughly around 20 years old now) It was released for the Sega Saturn in 1996, but got a re-release on XBLA, PSN, and Steam in 2012. It looked really ambitious back in the day, and if i grew up with it, I would have loved it even more.The first thing I immediately fell in love with in this game was it's musical score. This is easily one of the soundtracks I've ever heard in a video game. It captures the feel of the game nicely and it really flows together really well, as well as being really catchy, the tune 'Dreams Dreams' will always get stuck in my head.The visuals, I'm sure that 20 years ago it looked quite good, I think they still hold up, not particularly on the looks of the game, but it's imagination, and scale, which compliments the games levels, which are, for the most part 2-D gameplay in a 3-D world. But sometimes the game will like to change it up with other parts of the level. The backgrounds and the entire look of the levels, while may look outdated visually, they look impressive from an artistic standpoint in my opinion.There's a time limit in every level, but the game isn't exactly punishing if you run out of time. This is what i like to call a 'laid back' video game, a game that you can really sit back and relax too. The games controls beautiful with a controller, tho for PC users, the keyboard and mouse are a little wonky, not terrible, but do take time to get use to.If you haven't tried NiGHTS into Dreams yet, then i think you should give it a shot, it's not that expensive, unless you're going out of your way for an original Sega Saturn copy. It's normally around $10 which is a pretty good deal, and it comes with some nice extras if you're going after the HD Re-release. NiGHTS is an experience, one that can't be overlooked."

The level was colorful, fun, and compelling in an enchanting way -- which brings me to this enhanced version and port of the 1996 game!NiGHTS Into Dreams pulled me in with its warm setting and upbeat music as expected. Two outstanding tracks include the DnB tune ""The Dragon Gave Out a Loud Scream"" with a likewise, screaming saxaphone and the ""Message from Nightopia"" track used in Sonic Adventure. However, what engaged me most were the score-attack mechanics. Controls were simple once I understood what was going on, like driving a super-simplified car for the first time. Next comes racking up points. It feels so satisfying to nail a 25+ combo from flying through rings and orbs at a fast pace. After getting that far, I would feel an adrenaline rush to keep the current string going.I had some frustrations when it came to boss battles, and it's not about the bosses themselves, but the clock and punishment. Each boss requires a different strategy to beat it, and some are less obvious than others. By the time I learned how to deal with said boss, time was too short to defeat it. When you lose to a boss, the entire stage is over, meaning you must start from the beginning. Not too bad, seeing as the courses prior to the boss take 8 minutes at most but it gives you a shot to get a higher score.One other complaint is that any mode of movement that was not flying was not as fun, because it took more control of my character than I wanted it to. The worst was a rail platform that slams into NiGHTS and battled with my attempts to swing NiGHTS toward required orbs.My complaints are however outweighed by enjoying the rest of the game and a fantastic soundtrack to boot. This one is highly recommended, especially since it goes for little over a US dollar during some sales."
,Recommended,219950,28017745,"Posted: 28 November, 2016",all,Arclayn,"I find it unfortunate that Sega had flailed about so badly after their glory days of the Sega Genesis, and  I admit to an uncommon difference of opinion that I found Sega much more compelling during its declining days of the Saturn and Dreamcast.  To be sure, the Saturn was ineptly engineered, but it possessed a handful of absolutely beautiful gems that were not to be found anywhere else.  Among them, Nights Into Dreams.The beauty within Nights isn't about any one thing, but the experience taken as a whole.  Gameplay is simple time-trial courses, but the whole ""child's dream land"" themepark combined with the grace of acrobatic flight is positively surreal.  Each of the end stage bosses is its own deviously crafted challenge.I was ecstatic when Nights first came to Steam, as it brought Nights back from an obscure past of long dead gaming consoles for more people to enjoy.  Understand that for all my gushing -- I had played Nights quite a bit back in the 90s.  These days I find myself with more games than free time (hence my rather low time investment in the Steam version).  However, I remember Nights on Saturn as one of the greatest of classics, and the Steam release is fully worthy of that memory.Nights is not the kind of game that will appeal to everyone.  ""Andrenaline pumped 'this is gonna be epic' Bruce Willis passively sauntering away from fiery-splosive collateral damage"" type of gamers probably should keep on sauntering.  But!  For the gamer that appreciates a great video game much like a museum curator appreciates Vincent Van Gogh -- look no further."

On to the review.Nights Into Dreams will no doubt give you a game that you've never played before. You (like me) may have thought the idea of just flying through hoops is boring, but this is by far one of the most original games I have ever played. It reminds me of the days where Sega was one of Nintendo's greatest competitors, and this title definitely compares to the quality of fun you would find in any Nintendo game.The boss battles are interesting, though this game is sort of played in a trial and error style, since I don't recall the boss battles ever having been explained. You sort of have to figure it out, and since the boss battles are timed, any moment you spend trying to figure out how to face the boss is time you lose harming the boss, which may cause you to have to repeat the stage all over again.If I could find any flaw in this game, that would be it.So in summary:Pros:*Original Ideas            (very unlike any game you've played before)*Nostalgic                   (the original sega saturn version is also included with the game, along as an HD remake)*Immersive                 (Every level is timed, including the boss battles so the entire time you are playing you are trying to                  collect as many things, to break other things, to get to the boss battle and complete the level.*Your parents might enjoy it as well, even if they don't usually play games. (My mom does)*Unpredictable         (this game may seem like a 2D game at first glance, but there are times where you can run around in circles, jump, or fly in directions that you never expected to be there. This game may seem very new every time you play it.Cons:Better played on a gamepad with an analog stick, but the game is definetely enjoyable by just using the keyboard."

I haven't had any technical problems with it so far and the controller is smoother to play with than a Saturn controller. NiGHTs is difficult to compare with other games, it is like a platformer but with lots of flashy acrobatic flying around the screen instead of jumping. The system will take a lot of getting used to but after that it's actually quite a simple game to play. It is good for short play sessions, most of the challenge will come from trying to beat your own scores as the process of completing the game is quite easy. The story and world are fun, you are in a dream world being invaded by nightmares, it ranges from chill-out to surreal to faintly creepy. There is no death, only running out of time, but the timing can be very tight and enemies will knock 5 seconds off your 120 second time limit. The music is pretty cool, if a little experimental."

This game is fast, bursting with vibrant color and catchy music that you'll never forget. My only complaint is that the game only runs the at the console's original speed of 30 frames per second. If you grew up in the golden age of gaming then NiGHTs Into Dreams should be in your collection."

It is short and very good, it has both Sega Saturn version and Brand New HD version. And I played them both! ^_^ NiGHTS is one of those games that can really take you away in a world of dreams! And while I was playing it was always making me feel so nostalgic about my own childhood regardless I didn't have this game when I was a kid, sadly... The soundtrack is amazing!For the first time you can think that this game is very easy till you finish all locations and there is no final boss, then you realize you had to work harder on your ranks! :D So it can take some time.No regrets I spent 11 hours on this game.Honestly this game is flawless for me.

,Recommended,219950,9688589,"Posted: 31 March, 2014",all,PookPunk,"NiGHTs into dreams is a port of the classic SEGA Saturn gem from 1996. The goal is simple and requires capturing stolen Ideya by collecting at least 20 blue orbs and destroing the capsules. The sooner you destroy the capsule, the more time you have to collect more points before the time runs out. Once you've collected all four Ideya, NiGHTs is warped into a boss battle. There are four stages for the two characters, Claris & Elliot. The fourth stage for each character, Twin Seeds is the same and in order to unlock it you need at least all C's on previous stages. The game is short, but sweet. However, it can be a real challenge to get all A's on the stages, which is required to unlock the Christmas NiGHTs. SEGA has given the game a nice HD improvement, thus boosting more colorful and vivid visuals than the Saturn version. You can play the game in two modes, HD & Saturn. The keyboard controls for this game can take some adjusting and I would reccomend getting a Xbox 360 controller since this game was really meant to be played with a controller. This is indeed a good port of a very good game, probably Sonic Team's only masterpiece. Truely a gem."

,Recommended,219950,18563360,"Posted: 18 October, 2015",all,adbevers,"A charming and beautiful updated classic for those who are willing to give something a little different a try.  Let me address some of the complaints;First off, yes the game creators didn't quite make the objectives entirely clear (There were no ""in-game tutorials"" in 1996!) so I would reccomend hitting up any of the player guides available online,  it's not rocket science, and it will open up a really worthwhile experience.Secondly, the game DOES in fact support native plug-n-play controller support.  Again, this may not be obvious to the unintitated, but if you left-click the game title in your Steam library, it will bring up a Menu.  Select ""Game Configuration"" and presto, you can activate your in-game controller.   I personally find the Xbox 360/One controller work admirably for this game.With some of the fundamental complaints out of the way, let me heap a little more praise on this game;  It's memorable, unique, and charming in a way that gamers usually only find in a Miyamoto developed title.  A true classic, and it makes me wish Sega would invest a little more effort in updating it's back-catalog of similar gems."

I have discovered this game a little later in my life, so I'm pretty much jealous of the guys who actually GREW up with this game. Must've been a magical experience for you all...Anyway, my thoughts for this game. Played the Sega Saturn version of this game (on an emulator, at least), and it's controls are simple enough. At least two buttons to drill dash and two more buttons to do some tricks. With that, you're all set for a flying adventure that will make you dizzy and your fingers aching the first time!Now what can I say about this port? It's everything I envision in its HD remake: smoother models, better resolution, HQ textures, and an actual main menu! The controls are also optimized well for PC gaming, and that's well appreciated.The music? Still as good as ever! NiGHTS music really has this certain thing to it that distinguishes it perfectly from Sonic's musical scores (which is just as good, btw). I still listen to it from time to time and it really is a great music for daydreaming :PThe story? Unlike its sequel, the story really is a bit hard to catch since we're only given a few cutscenes explaining how Elliot and Claris ended up in the night dimension, and I get that each stage and bosses means something storywise, but it's always not easy to understand.The bossfights? Creative! Each level has its boss, and each one has a different tactic required to beat them. My personal favorite is Reala's, because it's straightforward; no timing, no patterns, just aerial acrobatic action! After a while though, it's gonna get repetitive, so savor the awesome feeling you get in the bossfights while you still can!Overall I give this game a 9/10 - you must try this at least once in your life! It's a good game, and one that will help you remember what being a child is like, should you forget."
,Recommended,219950,13645715,"Posted: 27 December, 2014",all,BillLensel,"What a breakthrough year 1996 was for three-dimensional gaming. The most popular titles left and right reveled in this new format, from ""Tomb Raider"" to ""Quake"" to ""Super Mario 64"", to what would be Sega's best game since ""Sonic the Hedgehog 2"".""NiGHTS Into Dreams"", with its years of reputation as a cult classic, is the most exhilirating and structured 3D effort in the Sega library. It really does make sense that Sonic Team would be the ones to create this game, because it translates every last good detail about the Sonic games into 3D. What this game nails most of all is the sense of how dynamic speed becomes its own experience as you play. The faster you zoom through each level's circuits, doing more and more things while your score climbs into the tens of thousands and upwards, the more it's revealed how the game uses 3D to create a space for all this action. By placing the focus on score-attacking, the 3D spacing of ""NiGHTS Into Dreams"" allows every movement and press of the action buttons to build into a chain of arcade-style accomplishments. It's less vast than other games from 1996, and most of Sega's 3D forays after this game, but it's leaner than any of them.The fantasy setting of this game, about two kids uniting with a friendly creature to fly through a dreamscape, grows out of its structure. It's used nicely, and the pop-psychology themes about courage and the subconscious become one big stocking stuffer to go with everything else in the game. This Steam version is a bigger stocking than the original game, with bonus content and the option between PS2-quality and Saturn-quality graphics, and the main game is just as great."

This game is short to say the leas of it. If you are good at the game or just pick up things fast then this may at best take you 2 hours to complete the game. There is a lot of replay value in it though. Note the fact that the Sega Saturn version of the game mod you can paly is not like the actual SEGA Saturn version though. Simmilar, but frame rate differences and draw distances are not the same. The Saturn version to me is easeir to play. the graphics are nice and pritty for what it is. I own both NiGHTS into Dream and Christmas NiGHTS into Dreams so I know the differences. Sadly I can say much about the PS2 version, which this is for the most part an exact port of. The A-life system is fun to mess around with adding in the content from Christmas NiGHTS that tells you the status of your winged baby freaks.(NiGHTOPIANS) To be honest it is worth checking out, just be aware it is on rails when you are NiGHTS.

In Nightopia, distinct aspects of dreamers' personalities are represented by luminous colored spheres known as Ideya. However, the evil ruler of Nightmare, Wizeman the Wicked, is stealing this dream energy from sleeping visitors, in order to gather power to take control of Nightopia and eventually the real world. To achieve this, he creates numerous beings called Nightmaren, including two acrobatic jester-like, flight-capable beings called NiGHTS and Reala. NiGHTS rebels against Wizeman's plans, and is punished by being imprisoned inside an Ideya Palace, a gazebo-like container for dreamers' Ideya.One day, Elliot Edwards and Claris Sinclair, children from the city of Twin Seeds, go through failures. Elliot likes to play basketball, but is challenged by kids from another grade and loses. Claris wants to sing in a play but is overcome by stage-fright in front of the judges. That night, the two of them arrive in the dreamworld and suffer nightmares about these incidents. They escape into Nightopia and find that they each possess the rare red Ideya of courage, the only type Wizeman cannot steal. They release NiGHTS, who tells them about dreams, Wizeman and his plans, and the three begin a journey to stop Wizeman and restore peace to Nightopia.NiGHTS into Dreams... is split into seven levels or ""Dreams"", each divided further into four ""Mares"" and a boss battle. The levels are distributed equally between the two child characters; three are unique to Claris, three to Elliot, and each play through an identical final seventh level, ""Twin Seeds"". Initially, only Claris' Spring Valley and Elliot's Splash Garden are available, and successful completion of one of these unlocks the next level in that child's path. Previously completed stages may be revisited to improve the player's high scores; a ""C"" grade in all the selected child's levels must be achieved to unlock the relevant Twin Seeds dream for that character.Various acrobatic maneuvers can be performed, including the ""Paraloop"". Flying around in a complete circle causes any items within the loop to be attracted towards NiGHTS. The game features a combo system known as ""Linking"", actions such as collecting items and flying through rings are worth more points when performed in quick succession than they are individually.After completing the four Mares, you're transported to Nightmare to confront one of Wizeman's Nightmarens, and you have two minutes to defeat the boss, the time taken contributing to your total score for that Dream. After defeating each boss you can play a level again, and choose via the menu which boss to fight.The game keeps track of the moods of the Nightopians (harming them will displease them, for example), and it features an evolving music engine, allowing tempo, pitch, and melody to alter depending on the state of Nightopians within the level.Combining original graphics and gameplay with beautiful soundtrack and atmosphere, Nights into Dreams... is considered by many the best Sega Saturn game, as well as one of the best games ever made."

This set includes the Sega Saturn Nights into Dreams, the Japan only PS2 update of the game, and Christmas Nights, the festive pseudo sequel.  The graphics are quite good, even the older version, but with the updates it looks excellent, giving a dreamlike visual to a beautiful world.  The music is excellent, suitably cheerful most of the time, but apprehensive when fighting the bosses and above all else, ethereal, dreamy, and very appropriate.I am a bit biased, I love Nights, I admit, however we do need to talk about the controls.  The original had the Sega Saturn controller with a special analog stick offering unparalleled freedom and maneuverability with Nights, our main character.  The Steam version uses...the keyboard.  Good god...it is very clunky and to my knowledge, the game does not support the use of a control pad.  However, if you have a logitech controller, you can map the keys to the control pad, which is HIGHLY recommended.  Otherwise, the controls are a chore for such a beautiful, stellar game.  With a controller, while not as good as on the Saturn, it is...enjoyable enough.Do I recommend you get this package?  Well, the Saturn version controls better, but for the price, convenience, and the graphical updates, I must recommend you pick this up...just be sure you have a logitech controller to map the controls to it, otherwise you may not enjoy the game as much as you should.

The whole feel of the game is sadly unintuitive and confusing.The goal of each of the stages is to free four orbs from these alien orb holder things on four different preset planes (one for each orb) that guide you around the same environment. While you fly around to find these aliens, you need to gain meter to be able to fight the aliens. You gain meter by flying through rings, defeating smaller enemies, and getting combos. The problem is your camera is very restrictive and it's very difficult to see where else you could be to get more rings, and you'll often complete levels with poor ratings and have no idea how to possibly improve. If you run out of time in these stages, you will no longer be NiGHTS and are stuck as a kid who can't fly and you'll be forced to stumble through an environment that was obviously not built to be walked through; and the time limits are not forgiving at all. Nothing is communicated to you besides randomized loading screen hints and it's likely that you'll be confused how to play when you boot up the game. You're just kinda thrown into the first level and then your orbs get taken away.The bosses are also pretty flawed. If you fail the boss, you have to do the previous stage from the beginning. The bosses have even less forgiving time limits because finding out how to beat them on your first way through is a crapshoot. Here's a dragon. Here's two minutes. Here's no visual clues on what to do. Good luck. (you have to fly at the dragon's face... in what game do you just fly at the oncoming monster and not wait for the dragon to stumble or a weapon to spawn.. come on man). Time limits are way too short.I owned the Wii sequel and had fun with it a long time ago, I'm not sure why it is I find this game to be inferior when basically everyone disagrees. The music in this one is charming and the character is nice, but I'm just frustrated with this."

The camera is so zoomed in (much MUCH more than, say, an old Sonic game) that the wonderful feling of 360 degree flight and linking rings is constantly interrupted by scanning up and down to find the next group of them; there are huge gaps in the level with no leading collectibles to guide you, and it really interrupts the flow of the game, which... seems to be the whole point, the flow. There's no other way to experience that flow except by rote memorization of level routes.And the mechanics are so esoteric and unexplained (even within the ""tutorial"", which is just a flipbook instruction manual which doesnt talk about even half of the in-game objects) that your ability to interact with and understand the mechanics is very limited except on, I imagine, far repeated playthroughs after looking through guides. The game's very, very short unless you care about getting high rankings, but I don't know how you'd figure out how on your own considering it's not clear how valuable time, links, bonus rounds, and etc. are to point totals (I got totally mixed results when trying to prioritize one/all).The HD version doesn't adapt the pre-rendered visuals well; they feel either uncanny or unclear. There are no gameplay improvements I can find in the HD version (like an adjustable camera).If you like the idea and surrounding aesthetics of this game, hunt down the Wii game; neither are masterpieces, but it's basically this but better executed."

It is just so far from anything else out there that there's no base to compare it to. The reviews and gameplay videos I'd watched beforehand had done little to give me a mental image of what it actually is, so it was still largely a mystery to me when I finally got to try it.My best attempt at an explanation is as follows: it's an arcade-style pseudo-platformer which revolves around semi-free flight through a 3D environment on a shifting 2D plane. You collect floating orbs with the goal of gathering 20 of them as quickly as possible, which allows you to break open a bigger glass orb once you find it and enter a bonus mode in which you try to collect as much stuff as you can and return to the start (the 2D path forms a convoluted loop) before the timer runs out. Each time you do this, the 2D path which you travel along will shift to incorporate different parts of the 3D world. After completing 4 such paths, you leave the main world to fight a boss; the faster you defeat the boss, the more your score will be multiplied, and the better your letter grade for the world will be (with one of the game's 100%-completion goals being landing the A rank on every level - which is no easy task!).Recommended if you're looking for a break from the norm that won't be a huge time-consumer. That said, it might be good to wait for a sale, as for all the incredible uniqueness it offers, it is sadly quite short with only six normal levels and a seventh shorter level."

Just don't take too long or else time will run out and you could wake up from your dream, then its game over.For a game that came from the same team behind the original Sonic The Hedgehog, NIGHTS Into Dreams is a delightful experience and a really good stress-reliever to play. Visually it's very bright and colourful with lots of unusual textures to make the gameplay feel like you're flying around in a whole new world!My only issue with the game is because there hasn't been too many sequels, this game does feel a little aged...Whenever I play this game, no matter what system, it feels like I'm playing a game from 1997.

The two children encounter a dream entity called NiGHTS, captured for rebelling against his master -- the master of Nightmares -- Wizeman. By merging with NiGHTS, the children can explore their dreamscape, defeat Wizeman's minions, and finally confront the master himself.Despite the premise, the game is light-hearted. The player controls the children through colorful and musical 3D worlds, complete with their own artificial life. Once you merge with NiGHTS, you begin a play through four courses that will take you around the level, collecting pickups to unlock each course successively. You control NiGHTS on a 2D plane that weaves around in 3D space, so you only have to worry about going forward, back, up, or down. Courses are also timed; letting the timer run out turns you back into a child, legging it back to the start, and scattering the pickups around you.In order to progress to the boss of a level, you must finish four courses with a good enough average score to proceed. Score is improved with the pickups you bring with you, as well as how often you went through loops, or picked up items, in succession.NiGHTS Into Dreams... is not a long game. However, it takes a while to truly master its scoring system. Until you gain the mastery of doing acrobatic loops through the skies, you'll be accompanied by dynamically changing music tracks, uplifting beats, and controls that are easy to pick up.There is more to the game than I've written above -- the ability to hatch and help the artificial life grow, the addition of the Christmas NiGHTS limited edition content, updated graphics, and more. This HD re-release is a port of the uncommon PlayStation 2 version. While a timing bug has crept in, making the animations a bit too fast compared to some musical cues, this edition is still faithful to the original's gameplay and spirit. The music alone has sold me to this game many times over."

In fact, it's what I consider to be my all time favorite video game. I first played it a little as a child at my cousin's house. Then, when I was in middle school, I borrowed said cousin's SEGA Saturn for two whole years JUST for this game, and only returned it because he eventually asked for it back. In recent years, I've gotten some of my friends interested in this game as well. So naturally, I have a bit of a biased opinion towards this game. Even so, I will try my hardest to leave a fair review of it, and will try to address how it stands from a gaming perspective, as well as an HD remake and PC port perspective.The premise is as follows: Two children who are struggling with their personal aspirations in the waking world find themselves in the dream world, teaming up with a flying jester to stop the Lord of Nightmares from acquiring enough of a type of dream energy that would enable him to enter our world. The plot is a bit weird yet simple and creative all the same, and the feel of the game captures that quite well. On top of that, the characters, while equally simplistic, are harboring both the same goals and doubts many of us have also experienced at their age, and over the course of the game, they are made to confront and attempt to overcome their personal demons, with two moments in the final level really capturing those elements of their journey. The gameplay is unique, distinct, and really does capture what it feels like to be in a dream world with its visual presentation and the music found throughout the game. The difficulty can be pretty hard for newcomers, though some may get the hang of it pretty quickly. It's pretty simple and straightforward, but performing well, especially for getting higher scores, can be quite challenging. Once you've gotten the hang of it, though, you could probably beat the main game in one evening. That being said, it is VERY replayable and addictive, and I often find myself coming back to play it whenever I've had a rough day. After all, we usually go to sleep so that we can relax, rest, and have the physical, mental, and emotional strength needed to confront the ordeals of tomorrow, and at least for me, NiGHTS into Dreams helped me do that at a time when I needed it most.As an HD remake, the game gives you the option of playing all of the original game's levels with either the original graphics or a far higher resolution. And let me tell you, the HD graphics are breathtaking! In addition, the remake also includes a special winter themed level that was included in the Christmas NiGHTS version of the original Saturn game, as well several other time and date based elements introduced there. However, the multiplayer versus mode that was in the original game is inexplicably missing, along with a lot of other bonus content found with the Christmas NiGHTS game. Having played the Xbox 360, PS3, and Steam versions of this game, the only real differences I have noticed are that the PS3 version has slightly longer loading times which happen more often than either of the other versions. Beyond that, though, I haven't found any noticeable gameplay differences, so you can't really go wrong no matter which version  you pick.Regardless, this is a game anyone can enjoy (heck, it was originally rated K-A, or Kid to Adult, when it was released on the Saturn), and for good reason. My own history with the game aside, it is just the right blend of relaxing and intense: beautiful graphics, creative stages, simple yet addictive gameplay with just the right amount of challenge, a story that is easy to understand and characters who are easy to identify with, and an absolutely wonderful soundtrack. I would highly recommend buying this game and giving it a shot, especially if and when it goes on sale. You will not regret it. Thank you for taking the time to read this, and sweet dreams!"

I bet that if I would have own Sega Saturn and this game back then when I was a kid, I would have probably cried tears of joy like I did when I heard Sonic Generations' classic version of ""Green Hill Zone"" . (No joke)Although, I can find some faults which bother me a bit. First of all, the story is rather meh imo. But then again, I think that the stories of the games weren't the main thing back then (unlike nowadays; game has a bad story, it most likely will get bashed to ground). The game is fairly short too. Not that many games were long back then either. The re-mastered version is rather hard to navigate too in my opinion, hence why I stayed in the Saturn mode most of the time.I'd say it's worth of it's 8€ price tag."

Well, a few years and a Christmas later, I finally have the game, so how does it hold up? Well if you're on the fence of buying a Sega Saturn game, fear no more, for this game is fantasitc. The gameplay is fast and addictive, and one could find themselves playing through the entire game if they really wanted to. The music is also top notch, complementing the scenery very well. However, I do have some gripes with this. For one, the game is short, like about a one to two hour session if you don't count the included Christmas NiGHTS (which is a great edition, I might add.). Also, I recommend playing the game with a controller. The keyboard works fine, but it'll get some getting use to.Overall, this is a great game to have in one's collection, especailly if it's on sale.

It's a true work of art during the golden age of the Saturn era and as with most games that came out during that time, it does has its own unique charm.  I would say for those who remember how awesome it was to loop de loop or make a Fantastic Seven, this game hasn't aged at all.  For those who never tried it, don't be afraid and try it for yourself. I will also add that anything from the Saturn and Dreamcast age are worth trying out for yourself.  NiGHTS is a part of gaming history and thus a game that you should NOT miss out on.

Created at a time when 3D Graphics were new, it perfectly illustrates the dreamy, hazy feel, of entering a entirely 3D envirement to explore. It's filled with wonderful graphics, bright visuals, but a with a much more frightening overtone than that of Super Mario 64 or Spyro. It may not have been the success SEGA had hoped for, but it truly showed what creavity can do when given a canvas of computer graphics. The version here is the PS2 version, which comes with the original Saturn release packed in. I urge you to try that original version, and see a marvel of what the future of 3-D gaming promised at a time of new technology."
,Recommended,219950,28667465,"Posted: 26 December, 2016",all,N64Lain,"Oh the Sega Saturn. In my opinion, it's one of the best consoles ever made. It was also the very first console I ever played! I had a few games for it when I was just 5-years-old. Virtua Fighter 2, a couple sports games, and the sampler disk for NiGHTS. Unfortunately, I'm not even sure if I even got to play those games before my Saturn broke. But that's a whole other story. The Saturn was a failure in terms of sales here in the US and nobody talks about it when the fifth-generation of consoles is brought up. Yet people seem to fondly remember this game and some claim it's the best Saturn game of all time!Another unfortunate event at the time was that the only way to play NiGHTS was to either buy a Saturn and get a copy, or buy a Japanese PS2 just to get a copy of the exclusive remake of the game! Rightfully so, fans of the original were mad, so petitions were made and many voices cried out for the purple jester to return! Well, in 2012, their dreams, no pun intended, were about to come true! Sega had heard the cries of the fans and finally gave NiGHTS what it deserved, a full HD remaster! Gamers who have never played NiGHTS into Dreams before could finally experience it in glorious HD! But was it all worth it?I do have a Japanese copy of NiGHTS for the Saturn, but I haven't played it in a long while due to my dumb self doing the swap trick and destroying the laser (Thanks Panzer Dragoon Saga for being so expensive!), so this review will be a comparison between both the original NiGHTS and the Remastered version. In terms of similarity, everything seems to be there. No levels were cut and the game seems to play just like I remember it. Thankfully there are also instructions for new players to help get a grip with the game, and trust me you are going to need it!The game is easy to learn and very hard to master. When you start the game, all you have to do is walk towards NiGHTS, yes that's literally the characters name, and fly around a course collecting these pearls called ""Ideas"" in order to destroy these Metroid-looking cages containing pearls that you need to move on to the boss of that level. Each path you take to each of the four pearls is very different, making the game free yet also very linear. Thankfully, NiGHTS controls very well so you won't have to worry about crashing into walls, well when you get used to the controls anyway. The gameplay is a double-edged sword. You may have some trouble getting used to it at first, but once you do you'll have a lot of fun.And you should have a lot of fun anyways because the game is so damn beautiful!! Once you load up any of the levels for the first time you'll instantly feel happy! There's no way you could feel sad in the world that NiGHTS takes place in. The levels are really unique too! One level you will be in this electrical canyon filled with imaginitive machines, and in another level you will be bobsledding like an Olympic champion! This game is very unique in the presentation. It feels very dreamy! (Pun intended that time)And I can't talk about the game without mentioning the music. I could put the whole soundtrack on my iPod and listen to it when I go to sleep at night. It's one of the best soundtracks I have heard in a video game. EVER!! The sound effects aren't as good, but they really do make the game come to life. Overall, the game sounds great. Especially if you have a sound system hooked up. Really takes advantage of that.I'll be honest. It may not be my favorite Saturn game, that title belongs to Fighters Megamix, but it is the first one I always recommend to people getting into the Sega Saturn. I can see why there are a lot of NiGHTS fans that love and adore this game. I can even see why some people would call it the best on the system! The gameplay is very unique and there hasn't been a game like it since (Except for the not-as-good sequel, Journey of Dreams). I totally recommend trying the game at least once. Trust me, it's a little tricky at first, but the presentation makes it all worthwhile.And Sega, please give us NiGHTS 3. I wanna see Elliot and Claris back in action."

You collect orbs, break open a capsule, and return stolen orbs to your start area.-The second lap starts and wow your exploring a new area of the same level. Then the third.-You finish with horrible scores and then do the boss. You wounder why he dies so quick and easy.-Your bad scores get you frustrated but you attempt to complete all the levels anyway.-You do or dont finish all the levels and then drop the game with the mindset of ""Its a pretty game for how old it is, but there is not much here. oh well.""- you watch this video and learn you are just stupid but its not your faulthttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CytvFECe5Rs-You give the game a second shot, become addicted, and return back to it for a few quick runs through a level every once in awile because it gives you that same thrill you got from playing Sonic on your Genesis.The game has an open world you can explore as the kids at the beginning of the level to give yourself an edge with the score. You can have enough blue orbs to instantly get the first crystal ball thing back.The faster you get your stolen crystal ball things back, the more bonus time you get. During the bonus time, blue orbs turn gold and give you double points. Dont go to the 2nd lap! Instead, pass over the goal to do more laps with your extra rewarded time.Once you figure this out then everything makes sense and that feeling of ""JUST ONE MORE LAP"" kicks in and it becomes insane and challenging, but only as much as you want it to. Also the first boss feels like a too easy chore the first time around, but once you learn that your score can be up to doubled based on how fast you kill the boss at the end of each level, it becomes a intense race to kill him. And an even greater feeling when you learn the trick to killing him in one single hit. (and getting a trophy for it ;) )The game also has these angel guys similar to Chao from Sonic Adventure. You find them throughout the worlds. You can hatch them and help them out. As you make them happy and grow their population. Depending on your relationship with the creatures, the music of every single level changes. They have darker and happyer versions of each level's soundtrack. Not only is that an impressive amount of tracks to indulge in, but it makes your actions feel like they have a inpact on the world your exploring. It feels less like running through a race track, and more like visiting Animal Crossing.In a summary though... for $5, you can get your moneys worth just by doing a quick run-through of the game. But if that is still not enough, If you are looking for something deep and addicting, you will find it here if you give it a second chance."

Buy 2 or 3 of these newer Sega ports and you'll start to get a bad taste in your mouth. It's sad that more care is not taken to provide an experience that mirrors and enhances the original without botching some random part of it.In this version the controls suffer from not being true analog. Everything looks a little more cheesy in the redone graphics, and a there are many other inconsistencies to the original that I wouldn't complain about if they made the game any better. But you still get a decent framerate and resolution which is more than you can get on the Saturn.This port could easily be patched up to fix the problems it has and in that case I would fully recommend it--NiGHTs is such a fun game that it doesn't matter if this port is kinda a hackjob, it's still just really fun, and I'll either play it on Steam or I'll play the real version on SSF.The graphics look great, I'll give it that.It's really hard to not recommend a game in the end, if that game is NiGHTs. I just wish there was a truly complete port of the original with all these added features to boot, and maybe some extra 2player LAN/online modes. I'd easily pay double the asking price for that."

When I first discovered NiGHTS, it was back in Sonic's Pinball Party. The pinball itself was great too. It had all the elements from this game. But, I never really knew who NiGHTS was back then. Hell, never even knew about this game as well! I played the sequel and that was fine, but I feel that this was much better than the sequel. I became a die-hard NiGHTS fan back in early 2016. I would recommend this game to anyone who loves NiGHTS. I possibly might not recommend it to newcomers. They may not know exactly what to do, but I feel that they will become more accustomed to it.
