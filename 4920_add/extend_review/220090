76561198361103888,Recommended,220090,32531005,Posted: 18 June,all,Creamery of the Century,"I first learned about The Journey Down while searching for freeware adventures many years ago. Among a list of amateur made games like The White Chamber and Out Of Order, there was the little pixelated prototype of The Journey Down. I played it and i loved and i wanted more of it. So here i am, finally having played the first 2 Acts of the commercial version. And i am more than satisfied.The Journey Down is very reminiscent of Grim Fandango in the best possible way. Intriguing setting, funny dialogue, cartoony visuals, surprising amounts of world-building. It provides everything i am looking for in a Point'n'Click game.Puzzles are pleasantly intuitive. There were only two times i had to resort to a walkthrough. First time because i overlooked an interactable spot. A hotspot indicator would have been a useful addition to avoid small annoyances like that. Second time was the very last puzzle of Act 2, which sadly is one of those abritrary idiotic pictogram reading and switch pushing puzzles. You know, like everything in the final area of Syberia 2. Ugh. Here's hoping there won't be any more of this nonsense in Act 3.The music accentuates the reggae atmosphere nicely. The voice acting is unfortunately rather uneven. The main character's VA is perfect for the role, everyone else ranges from passable to terrible. The audio quality itself fluctuates quite heavily as well, i had a hard time understanding certain characters.These are only the most minor of complaints though. All in all, i am super hyped for Act 3."

In short, if you enjoy P&C Puzzle games, do not buy this game.It's quite difficult to find an aspect of it I like- The puzzles were exceptionally poor, lacking in any kind of imagination or ingenuity (Think generic charity shop puzzle-book puzzles and you won't be far off). Where good Point and Click puzzle games move coherently from one puzzle to the next using logical plot points, it feels that the developers simply add arbitrary problems to form a chain of bad puzzles until it is long and bulked out enough to be called a game. This makes the game more of a chore than an enjoyable experience, as there is little in the way of progression or logic. Also, if you don't do the right action in a given time, the main character will explicitly blurt out the solution, cutting all satisfaction from the puzzle-solving experience.The characters were so one-dimensional it was laughable. Worse, some characters arbitrarily changed their personalities, sometimes hating the main character for no good reason, then in the next moment being overly nice with no explanation. Further, the main character was fundamentally unlikeable (This was not helped by the emotionless mask-like faces the characters have). I also thought the voice acting wasn't up to scratch- is it just me, or does Bwana dip in and out of his accent?The animation was quite poor, and at times environments looked very rushed and unfinished. The lip-sync was dreadful, and ruined any immersion the cut-scenes might provide.I also found the game to be completely humourless. The jokes fell so flat it was more of a cringe-worthy experience than a funny one. The only way to get through this game was to laugh at it rather than with.It was very sad to play this game after seeing comments likening this to greats such as Grim Fandango or Monkey Island (two of my favourite games). It is a husk of a puzzle game, and was genuinely the worst P&C puzzler I have ever played."
,Recommended,220090,31760772,Posted: 14 May,all,IFIYGD,"Overall Rating:8/10 - Well worth it on sale (which it is as of the time of this review.)Fun puzzler-point & click- adventure game.The puzzles are not difficult, so if you are looking for really challenging puzzles, this game probably will not be what you enjoy. Some bugs, nothing gamebreaking ofr me, but there are reports of some people having gamebreaking bugs. Can;t say if it is the game, or user error or SW/HW issues or conflicts. But it ram really well on my 5 year old desktop toaster.Pros:Charming sotry and character interactions. The story and dialogue between the characters is what really made this game special and enjoyable for me.Great diversity in ethnicity and heritages in the game. Some racial stereotyping, but not harshly done, more tongue-in-cheek and playful. Really nice to see the main characters NOT be all white, with the token minority bad-guy or victim thrown in. It was a really nice change, and balance of diferent cultures and viewpoints, without contention and prejudice.Fantastic music! Ever heard even one Bob Marley song and loved it? You'll enjoy the reggae vibe. Hate reggae? Don't play with music on., lol!Simple but nicely done graphics. Nothing outstanding, but the cartoonish look was enjoyable for me.Good voice acting! :oved the wide variety of voices, accents and regional dialects spread over the characters and NPC's. Bwana just made me smile every time he spoke.  :)Bwana's perpetual cheesy grin, and Kito's awesome posotivity, even when TSHTF. Just the most likeable 2 dudes you will ever see.  :)Cons:Short game, not much eplayability (unless you were charmed enough by the story to want to do it again, knowing where to go and what to do the second time through...)Full price may be a bit too high for what you get, especially if you were hoping for a really complex puzzler. Buy it on sale, 50% off or less.Some bugginess. Nothing game breaking for me, but I did need to relanch twice when the game froze up on me. Relaunching and going back to the last autosave fixed it for me, others on the forums have reported more gamebreaking bugs.TL;DR:  I was really charmed by the story, settings, music and characters. Enough to overlook some of the more obvious flaws the game had. I can't say I would recommend this at full price. But on sale, it is a great experience, even if it is not an amazing game. The experience made it worthwhile to me,  more than the actual gameplay.~Your Mileage May Vary. Widely.~"

They operate a dilapidated gas station in a Caribbean Port. Life was pretty relaxed and casual until the day they came across the journal; a book that describes the underworld and various information about their lost father. As orphans he had adopted and raised them and then soon after disappeared without a trace.The game has some good graphics and follows your typical point and click template. I felt like the production values were on par with major companies if not exceeding in many areas. My favorite part was the voice acting; the characters had soul and some personality that quickly immerses you in the story. This episode was pretty short at just 3 hours; but it was extremely enjoyable and time flew by! This is one of the best kickstarter games I have played without a doubt! If you don't like point and click games this won't change your mind about the genre or anything.Worth the $9; occasionally you can find this for $3-5 on sale.

Voice acting was uneven, and the fake ethnic accents were so terrible in certain portions of the game that it stepped into the realm of offensively racist. It tried to be funny but mostly failed, possibly exacerbated by the fact that the protagonist comes off as a lazy, idiotic, morally reprehensible buffoon that is very difficult to like. Puzzles were mostly logical but this game was ridiculously short, and even at the discounted price I got it I would expect it to provide me with more entertainment than a free version of Angry Birds. I did get this as part of a bundle so I can say that Part 2 was better, but still ridiculously short. If I had bought Part 1 by itself I would have saved myself the money on buying the sequel."

This is really what got my my attention. The humor is moderate, couple of laughs here and there, but it gets a bit exagerated at time. Cool in over all. The puzzle are simple and positiverly silly at best but if you just play for entertainment, not taking it too seriously (it's not Myst), you'll have a good time.Negative side:Ok, this is the only negative thing I have to say about chapter one. It was way, WAY, too short. You could probably finish the game in less than 15 min. I just started to warm up and really enjoy the game when the end credits just popped up. Shocking! I just couldn't believe it, I thought it was a prank.. but no, that was it, right to my face! That really killed all the appreciation I had for the concept.The fact is that the chapter one is nothing more than a teaser to get you to buy chapter 2. I bought both anyway simultaniously, but I do not appreciate such manipulation from story tellers, it really left me with a bitter after taste.I haven't played chapter 2 yet, and I am not as enthusiastic as before to start it, as it might be just another teaser... Eventhough I got both of them on sales I still feel like I got a bit ripped of, at least for chapter one. For such a short story it's not even worth 1€. The developers offer a free (low res) version of Ch1 from their site, i'd probably recommend that one instead.

The music is awesome - jazzy authentic reggae that is tailored for each scene.  The Afro-caribbean vibe was on point.

For an indie effort, the graphics are pretty decent although little details like character lip syncing and animation consistency are a bit lacking. Conversely, the voice acting is bad aside from the most important characters (I guess they called in friends/family to do the rest).

Overall, the Journey Down appears to be a labor of love with some decent work put into it.Here's why I'm not going to recommend this game: there is no story unfolding as you play the game nor is there any character development going on. This lead me to feel that I have very little invested in the game. I don't intend on buying the second chapter which may be an improvement on this chapter but chapter one is basically a scavenger hunt. You're asked to find some parts to fix a plane. That's it.

Sorry, not in my books."
,Recommended,220090,30754406,Posted: 26 March,all,MotherofSephy,"Developed by SkyGoblin Studios, the Journey Down: Chapter One creates an urban world where the player takes control of Bwana, a cool, Caribbean ""brudda,"" who works at a gas station on a pier.  The game begins when a young woman comes looking for a mysterious book that Bwana's long-lost adoptive father, Kaonandodo, once possessed.  This is only part one of a game trilogy.Though the game is relatively short (if you speed-run it and skip all the dialogue, you can beat it within half an hour), exploring the game and taking the time to look at each detailed scene will give the player an hour or two worth of time. The art style is immediately reminiscent of Grim Fandango, though with a more African and Caribbean theme.  The characters resemble Moai statues or strunken heads in a pseudo-modern setting.The puzzles are designed simply and the game is short enough that you won't have any problem remembering which character required which item or what item was needed to solve which puzzle.  The puzzles are very much like puzzles in the Monkey Island games, and it's clear the studio used LucasArts adventures as inspiration for style and presentation.  The cast is fully voiced and they will give enough hints to imply what they need.  There might be a time when you find yourself clicking everything on everything to  see what works, but the solutions are logical and with enough thought can be solved without ever needing a walkthrough.Though some reviewers have criticised the voice acting (and at times it isn't perfect), the one character I've seen the most criticism from is the main character, Bwana.  He has a thick, stereo-typical Jamaican accent, and despite the criticism, I find him the most charming and funny character, closely followed by his adoptive brother, Kito.  The wit in the writing stands out with these characters and Bwana's delivery on lines is so funny, though many times the limited animation on his face detracts from the seriousness of certain parts so the character often fails to come across as sympathetic in a few instances.The atmosphere created in the game is stunning.  With very little exposition and establishment of the setting, the player is brought into this cool, dark world run by an evil power company.  The painted backgrounds are gorgeous and accurately represent the urban setting cut off from the high-society.  The tone is eerie, with this goofy character, Bwana, juxtaposed by the governement corruption and dirty-dealings going on within the city.  Characters constantly drop hints about the evil power company, an embargo, and other political and corporate dealings that build up the city as a character in itself.  My favourite scene in the game is when Bwana talks with a man who works a newsstand under a bridge.  The man explains how the train doesn't stop at his location any more. That scene captures the setting completely with the ideas of corruption and not looking out for the little man.  It feels like a real city, even though the game only represents a minute fraction of the whole city.Lastly, the most noticably brilliant part of this game is the music.  It is astounding.  The composer who worked for SkyGoblin sadly passed away during the development of Chapter Two, but his legacy lives on through the game's soundtrack.  The soundtrack is available on BandCamp and I fully suggest getting it for both Chapters One and Two.  The music adds so much depth to the setting, creating the final piece to really put the player in this game's world.  It's memorably catchy, and adds an appropriate amount of melancholy to a generally humourous game.If the current price tag for the game is too much (given you are only getting one chapter), I suggest waiting for a sale (I bought it on sale as a Chapters One and Two Bundle).  However, if it's still too much for you on sale, the developer's website has a free, low-res version which makes the game pixelated, making it look much more like Monkey Island. A lot of love and care and research went into this game and I suggest supporting it."

,Recommended,220090,26574283,"Posted: 12 November, 2016",all,just.like.that,"The Journey Down is a classic point and click adventure. The story (without spoilers) is quickly told: You are one of two friends who run a gas station at the habour. A woman comes over and asks for your help. You need to fix your water plane to accomplish that. There's a reckless bad dude in the background who apparently wants to stop you.The majority of the game is you running around trying to get the missing pieces for the plane with no connection to the actual story.You have a handful locations and in each location a handful of things to click on or one or two people to speak to. The first 40 minutes or so this keeps you interested enough until you've read/heard all discriptions and dialogue.The game is extremely linear, you can't pick up stuff until you are told that you need it. This means that from a certain point on you have to revist known places again and again to find the one thing that has changed. Since there is no fast travel system and you can't even double click exits to skip through locations, you spend some time watching your character walk through the scenery. Thankfully, though, it is often pretty logical where you have to look so for the most part you at least have an idea where you should be going.Puzzles are the heart of adventure games and here TJD actually does a fairly good job. There are only a few but they are logical and often slightly humourous, a definite plus. There are also a couple of minigames that everyone who has played adventure games before will know.All in all, I expected more from the reviews that I've read. The first 45 minutes or so are nice, after that it becomes a bit of a chore since there is not much to explore after that.I bought TJD for 0.89 € on sale and for that price I recommend it. The full price (8.99 €) is ridiculous. With 3 hours playtime if you explore all dialogue options and make yourself a sandwich inbetween, this is more of a demo than anything else.Edit: After playing the second part I've changed my rating to recommended, since the second part is a lot better than the first part, definitely worth playing. To understand the second part you should have played the first one.I still think you should wait until it is on sale, though."

Furthermore, a company seems interested in this same book that holds some kind of power. Bwana's tasked with first trying to get his plane to work before flying off so that he might help Lina.First, the atmosphere in this game is one of my favorite components. It's a Jamaican/Carribean theme that's on a water front. It has some nice music playing the back, and I love the accents on the characters. The scenery is really amazing, giving it a bit of a noir feel as well. Characters Bwana and Kito are hilarious in their interactions, especially Bwana who seems hesitent of getting into any trouble. Can't say I blame him....The gameplay is your basic point and click game, with puzzles that you must figure out to progress. This is one of the easier point and click games, as I have not had to look up any walkthroughs to get by. That's not a huge complaint, as it is still mildly challenging.SkyGoblin actually has a free version of this game listed on their website in low res. Although, as they are using kickstarter to assist in continuation of the series I heavily recommend just paying for it. Its a great game, and smaller companies need our help for making awesome games like this. Keep in mind the rest of the series isn't out so if you want to wait just buy the game and wait for the final chapter before playing them all. It might be awhile though.

The world-building is not quite as unique asGrim Fandango, but it comes close. There's definitely aDouble Fineor late-period LucasArts vibe to the game, which really appeals to me. I'm invested enough in the story to consider buyingChapter 2at full price.The Bad: The gameplay is as simplified as point-and-click gets. No SCUMM parsers or clue-matching orThe Cave-style special abilities. While this makes it ideal for relative newcomers to the genre, veteran players may find it derivative. Most puzzles feel like variations on time-tested scenarios: getting past the hostile guard animal, tricking the snooty doorman, collecting MacGuffin parts (in this case, restoring a plane).The Ugly: Believe me, I prefer shorter games, but the play time for this felt kinda ridiculous, at just under the 4-hour mark.

I can forgive the somewhat rough animations and moderately unlikeable main character, but this game just oozes other problems.+Interesting art style-Rather dull point and click puzzles-Awkard writing and voice acting-Clearly a prologue to a larger story, but does very little to entice you into that storySome of the voice acting is ok, but a lot of it sounds like it was recorded using very low quality equipment or is very poorly mixed. Some of the characters are well-acted and memorable (the fisherman sticks out in my mind), but a few characters sound like they're trying to over enunciate or put emphasis on every line, which gets grating. Voice line clarity is all over the place and syncing is frequently off, with entire cutscenes being horrendously desynced. Even if you turn the sound off, the writing is nothing special.This is very clearly a prologue to a larger story, but instead does little to actually draw you into that story. Most of the exposition is in a few large, obvious dumps. We aren't so much shown there's a large conspiracy as we are repeatedly told about it. Character relationships jump all over the place, making it hard to get invested in anyone, and it's very obvious from 15 minutes in that virtually all the characters are simply puzzles that could just as easily be replaced by a pile of items and a note. There are elements of a better story here, but for the most part it's just a game of busy work, which is a shame, since the world does seem interesting.Speaking of puzzles, they're pretty bad, even for a point and click. Virtually all of them are use object on object inventory puzzles that may or may not carry a great deal of logic to them. There's a somewhat interesting if basic phone puzzle early on, but that puzzle style seems to be quietly dropped as soon as you leave the house. It's the ""click around the map until you find an item then click that item on every other item in the world"" school of puzzle design.At exactly one hour in, the game crashed, and I just don't think I'll ever be going back to it.

On its' kickstarter page (for episode 3) it spouts that it's on the same level as classics like Grim Fandango and the Monkey Island series. And, it's actually RIGHT! This game is everything you want from a classic point-and-click adventure game. It has the charm, the comedy, the well written and planned puzzles, and it even pokes some fun at some game cliches of the genre. The characters are very memorable, and the voice actors are absolutely perfect. I never thought I'd find a great point-and-click adventure game like this again, but the team at SkyGoblin have shown us that these games can totally still be made and that they aren't solely a product of their time.FOR THOSE OF YOU WITH LOW END COPUTERS - BUY THIS GAMEI have a laptop with an OKAY graphics card, nothing special. But I also have a desktop computer with a graphics card that can only run basically counter-strike 1.6 or gameboy advance roms (I don't support downloading games illegally or games that you don't already own). The reason I bring this up is because The Journey Down: Chapter One plays better on my desktop computer (which basically has no graphics card) than any other game I've ever played on it before. This game runs incredibly smoothly. Sometimes there's some studdering in the walk animation but I assume that's just the game engine and not a fault of computer hardware, but nothing is game-breaking. I'm extremely happy with my purchase and I wish more games were designed with a wider range of hardware in mind so that they are capable of running as well as The Journey Down does on all my devices. Seriously, keep your eye on SkyGoblin for future games, and support them on Kickstarter (currently episode 3 is on kickstarter as I type this) if you enjoy point-and-click adventures.TLDR:Do you like Lucasarts games, point-and-click adventures, or well written stories and characters? Then you should purchase this game. You won't have any technical problems, you'll just have a smooth ride into the awesome southern African influenced gameplay and story that is The Journey Down.Cheers."
,Recommended,220090,18963067,"Posted: 8 November, 2015",all,thehungrywolf,"The Journey Down is so ernest and genuine, you can't help but love it.TJD is a classic 3D point and click adventure in the vein of something like Grim Fandango. You usually have a given task to do, and you have to go around collecting seemingly unrelated items and using them to solve various puzzles to progress through the game. TJD uses ""adventure game logic"", which means that you can't use a mop to shoo away a pesky pelican, but you can stuff a fish with chilli peppers and then get the pelican to eat the fish, causing it to faint (from the spiciness). You see where I'm going with this? There is nothing wrong with that, however. It's a fun genre trope that brings me back to the days of the classic Monkey Island games.I'm not gonna talk much about the story, there are some interesting things here and there, but really it's the characters that make this game shine. Every character in the game has their own ""thing"" going on, making them amusing, though slightly 1 dimensional at times. The main charcter, Bwana, stands out as a very likeable guy that is very genuine and good-natured. You can't help but laugh at his interactions with others, especially those that know him well, like his brother.Two somewhat related flaws with this game: 1. The puzzles are very easy to solve IF you have experience playing these kinds of games and are familiar with ""adventure game logic"". There was only one puzzle that had me stumped, but for most others it really comes down to finding the right item and knowing what to do with it. Which leads me to # 2. The game is very short. Took me 2-3 hours to finish this chapter, probably due to how easy the puzzles were.Still, I highly recommend this game if you wanna have a fun afternoon playing an honest point&click adventure game. I will certainly play chapter 2 at some point in the near future."

It's very reminiscent of Grim Fandango.  The game's first chapter is a solid couple of hours with some good puzzles, and even though the game is fairly linear, you might get stuck a few times trying to find some obscure item hidden in the background.  There's only one or two examples of what I'd call ""pixel hunting"" in this game, and one of them is fairly apparent in the Giant Bomb Quick Look of this title.I don't know if I'd say the game is as funny as the best games of the genre, but it's pan-African-Jamaican style is certainly quite charming.  The world feels very lived in, even though it's only the first chapter of an episodic series.  My main reason for comparing it to Grim Fandango is that there is clearly a larger universe being set up, one far beyond the gas station where you start the game.

To have the backgrounds and scenes change to match each music score, gave me an enjoyable ammount of immersion.The puzzles, whilst not too taxing on the grey matter, were fun to work through.

This game was reccommended to me by a friend a while back -- I saw that it was 90% off during the Summer Sale (for $0.69) and decided to give it a try. The game is well-exectued, and delivers about what you would expect from a casual point-and-click adventure. The story is entertaining and straightforward, and the puzzles are well-placed and logical (even somewhat challenging, at points); the story is well-paced, and can be finished in under 2.5 hours. What stood out most about this title was the unique art style, consisting of 3d rendered characters on a 2d hand-drawn background. As a long-time gamer who has rarely seen this concept executed, I was rather impressed by the general mood and depth these environments were able to confer to the overall experience. With that said, this game is not for everyone, and especially not for those gamers that demand a constantly active and physically engaging experience. However, if you have fond memories of a time when point-and-click games were genuinely appreciated, especially titles like Grim Fandango, The Neverhood, The Secret of Monkey Island, etc., do yourself a favor and check this game out."

I have bought DLC for cheaper in other games provided several more hours of playtime. That is my biggest problem with the game. 9 bucks for 2 hours to me seems a bit on the pricy side. I sincerely hope that the next chapters have more to them than this first one. Because those are 20 bucks each and if they provide just 2 hours of gameplay again, I will be very upset.Despite me thinking this game is pricy for what you get out of it, if you get a bundle and especially if the bundle is on sale, I do recommend this game.

The art is beautiful and the music is purchase-worthy, but the actual gameplay is a little lacking. This point-and-click adventure got me stuck about 1/3 of the way through the first chapter, and I had to pull up a guide. The puzzles were not intuitive to me, so if you're looking for something to play without a guide, you're probably better off with something else, but it was still fun. Overall I think it is worth picking up, especially if you get it on sale through the Steam sales!"

,Recommended,220090,35442960,Posted: 3 October,all,davidolgarsson,"A refreshingly funny and well-written comedy adventure trilogy, with top notch voice acting, surprisingly good and super-stylized cel-shaded graphics and an entertainingly charming(albeit sometimes a bit confusing in its mythology) neo noir-meets-african-folklore-story. The final part might be a bit too easy, puzzle wise, and flew by very quickly, but as a whole, TJD succeds in doing something new and funny in the otherwise rather stale, unfunny and derivate genre of comedy adventure games."
