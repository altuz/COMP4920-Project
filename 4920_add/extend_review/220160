Would buy for 5 bucks any day.EDIT:Since this review has gotten popular, I decided to add to it.Trials is a unique game. Its a race against time, and is a ton of fun but can be very very challenging at some times. The controls are well done, and the bikes and tracks are all made well and the difficulty of each track is organized in a fair manner. Usings the controller works best with this game, in my opinion. The multiplayer isnt too active, but if you can get 4 friends over for some local trials races, you will have a blast, I guarentee it.The only downside to this game is that it uses uplay, but in my opinion, there really isnt any other game out there like this one, so it is worth it."

Some may even call me a b***h, and I'm totally fine with that. This all means that when games become super hard I generally tend to turn them off and do something that doesn't make me want to smash my face into a concrete slab. This game however, is incrediably rewarding and keeps me drawn in. I have unlocked all the tracks in both sections of the game (Trials HD, and Evolution). I in no way would ever concider myself a ""good"" trials player. Look up videos of folks pulling off Extreme traks with 0 faults, and you will know what god looks like. The reason that this game doesn't get frustrating, is the amazing physics system. I have never once felt like the game cheated me out of landing a partifuclar obstacle. Everytime I fail I know it is my own fault and the only thing standing between me and the finsih line is skill, not luck. This brings me back again again and again. If I have 20 minutes before I head to class to play a game, this is almost always what I chose. I try my hardest to get a gold medal on whatever track I chose. If I suceed, I feel like like the worlds biggest bad a** all day. If I fail, I'm no frustrated, and all day I'm thinking about what I need to do different to reach my objective.I love the fact that the online multiplayer allows you to use whatever bike and ride on whatever track you want (irregardless of weather or not you have unlocked that content in the single player.) This provided hours of enjoyment as me and my bestfriend tackled Extreme tracks knowing damn well we barely had the skill for Medium tracks. This system actually improved our skill quite rapidly and I'm all for it. I wish more games would allow players to access all content from the get go.I've never written a review before, so excuse me if this was all rambling, but this has become one of my favorite games of all time and so I felt it was fitting to share my opinion!"

The game it self is good fun but uplay makes it impossible to play with friends.
,Not Recommended,220160,8430451,"Posted: 30 December, 2013",all,Eddeman,"Let's get this straight: I absolutely adore this game, it is really fun to play and see how you improve over time.Even better if you have a couple of friends to compete with on the leadersboards or play a bit of multiplayer.You can even make your own tracks in the editor which is pretty easy to get started in, but advanced enough to make crazy minigames and really slick looking tracks.If the game will actually run at all for you that is.It seems to be a coin-toss if this game will work on your system or not, and if it actually does run it might still lag even with really good hardware. I'm running it with a HD7970 and an i7 3770k so it runs well just because of the brute force.My laptop on the other hand has a decent high end i7 (for a laptop) and a HD8870M and I can't even run the game on low settings in 680x480 (for reference, the laptop can run Battlefield 4 on low sort of okay in 1080p) without having lag.Other people have problems with the game not starting at all or crashing frequently.EDIT: Track central is now fixed and works just as well as it does on Xbox 360, removed the ""it's not working very well part"".It also has DRM in the form of uPlay, which will start when you try and start the game from Steam. It was pretty terrible in the beginning but seems to have improved a bit over the year (still would rather not have it). uPlay also handles the multiplayer part of the game if you want to make private games with friends and that part is incredibly broken too. Pressing invite from the in-game friendslist just crashes my game and I'm one of the lucky ones that it's the only problem I'm having with it.To sum things up I would recommend the game if I knew it would work properly, but with all the problems it has it really seems to be dumb luck wether it will work. The infrequent patches haven't done much to remedy the situation in the last few months so I honestly cannot recommend it when it's so broken for a big portion of the people that bought it."

He has an obnoxious laugh, he slurps his soda really loud, and every now and then he lets out a smelly fart.

,Recommended,220160,21261126,"Posted: 16 February, 2016",all,somebody336,"Trials Evolution: Gold Edition is a 2.5D physics platformer that combines both Trials HD and Evolution into one package. You are tasked with getting across each level as quickly and with as little crashes as possible. Looking at some screenshots of the game you may think it is an action packed racing game but in reality it is about overcoming various obstacles in your path by using careful precision. Keeping your finger on the acceleration key will make it far more likely that you will crash in a spectacular fashion unless you are really skilled at the game. You can crash as many times as you like and still get a bronze medal as long as you cross the finish line but to unlock more levels to play you will need to go for gold or at least silver. The fewer times you crash and the quicker you get to the finish line, the bigger your reward will be. Aside from medals you will also be rewarded with cold hard cash which you can use to customize your rider and the bikes in your garage.You will automatically unlock new bikes the further you get into the game and they all have different ways of handling. Some may be heavier and slower while others will be fast and very prone to flip over if not careful. Handling aside, each bike you unlock is a straight upgrade to the one you were using meaning that you are unlikely to use those bikes ever again. There is one bike called the Micro Donkey that is unlocked by completing any track without crashing or leaning though for the life of me I could not accomplish this so I have no clue as to how the bike is. Customizing your bike and rider is solely for aesthetic reasons and has no effect on gameplay. You can color each part of your bike individually, making it look like you painted your bike with whatever spray paint you could find in the dumpsters if you so desire. As for different parts there are very little to choose from so most bikes will look the same minus their colors. Same goes for the rider, not much clothes to pick from though you can color him however you please.Starting off you may be wondering which of the two games you should start off with but it doesn't really matter as you will have to constantly switch between the two as they are tied into each other. Whatever medals you earn in either will count toward your total to unlocking newer, harder tracks so you will have to play through both game's easy tracks in order to unlock medium difficulty ones. You can use the same bikes, same rider and the gameplay is exactly the same so it is very seamless, making it feel like one giant game. With the combination of two already decently sized games you will have a ton of content in this edition of the game. Trails HD no longer has its original soundtrack unfortunately and instead shares Evolution's soundtrack for some reason. Evolution also has a setback in that its DLC is not available for the PC which is really unfortunate since they were very fun. This version is by no means awful but I would suggest getting them on the Xbox 360 if that option is available to you.Port quality of this title is solid, ran well and I've experienced no glitches or crashes. Most people's issues seem to be with the added Uplay DRM. It runs far smoother than the 360 version especially when there are lots of explosions going on, which is a large portion of the time. It being a 2.5D game means that the explosions going off in the background can't harm you and are there to look cool. You can only move to the left and right of the screen though when you are sent hurling off your bike after a crash you can fly face first into objects that can't normally be interacted with. It is a small unimportant detail but it never gets old sending your poor rider spiraling off the course and directly into some explosives. There is no gore or blood, he will just ragdoll into objects while occasionally letting off a very goofy scream. Trials does not take itself seriously at all and it is always tongue in cheek about things such as the descriptions for the levels that are often times references to movies or other forms of entertainment.It is goofy, it has respawn points littered seemingly every couple of feet and you can respawn as often as you want but Trials is by no means easy. It may start off as seemingly easy and boring but it will quickly kick off the training wheels, leaving you to fend for yourself as it giggles making you slowly drive your way over a row of highly explosive barrels. These insane, nonsensical things it puts you through is a huge part of its charm and in no time you will be riding through a WW2 battlefield, a floating island full of giant stone golems and a haunted castle to name only a few. You never know what to expect next since the theme of each level varies so greatly and so does the level design. Even after you think you have mastered the levels near the end of the game you will be able to earn a 4th platinum medal which require 0 faults and little time wasted. They are by no means necessary as by the time you unlock the ability to earn them you will have already unlocked all the levels, they are just there to add replay value and earn bragging rights.After reaching the extreme difficulty tracks I'm just happy to get through a track and couldn't believe when I managed to get a silver medal on an extreme track even if I have played Trials since 2009. A neat feature incorporated into the game is the ability to view other player’s replays to see exactly how they got on the leaderboard and learn a few tricks from them. The community can even use the built in level editor to upload their created levels which are often time as good or better than the professionally made ones. It is a pretty powerful editor and I have seen the game turned into a First Person Shooter which was pretty mind blowing but honestly not that fun. There is tons of user created content to go through however the PC version has their own community that is separate from the Xbox version. That is really unfortunate since the Xbox version has been out much longer and has some amazing user created levels. Nonetheless what is here is typically pretty good and you will not be running low on tracks to play anytime soon.Aside from your typical tracks you can play through a variety of “Skill Games” which massively change up the core gameplay with crazy ideas such as attaching a rocket booster to your bike, riding on ski gear or flying a UFO. They are very creative and a ton of fun to play through a few times though they lose their appeal quickly. If you are low on medals they can be a lifesaver since they are usually easier to get gold on and there are a ton of skill games to swift through. The other mode is a simple tournament that has you riding through a gauntlet of tracks in order to gain some medals. Each track has their own leader-boards where you can compete against friends and strangers as well as a feature where you can upload your playthrough of the level directly to Youtube. There is just so much content to the game that you'll likely be playing it for a long time if the gameplay is to your liking. A demo is available on the Steam store page which is rare for a PC game but much appreciated and allows you to see if this is your cup of tea before buying. If you have the option of buying these games on the Xbox 360 I would suggest getting them there as Trials HD would feature its original soundtrack and Trails Evolution has some really cool exclusive DLC for it. If not, Trials Evolution: Gold Edition is still jam packed with content and is a very unique, addicting game that everyone should give a shot."

Practice makes perfect in physics based games like this and the satisfaction when you finally get a Gold or Platinum on Hard or Extreme is unrivaled. The graphics and levels are fantastic and the skill games are very fun. It is a hard game to put down once you start playing.

I am ranked around 6000th on the overall leaderboard, and have devoted over 4 days of my time to getting platinum on every track in the game.This PC port, however, is severely lacking. If you haven't used it before, the UPlay interface is atrocious, and its pitiful that Ubisoft requires their 3rd party software for all their games. The menu navigation is clearly designed for controllers, as sometimes you click things, but other times you are required to use the arrow keys (not WASD, arrow keys only) to navigate the menus and then hit enter to select. To be frank, if you are not playing with a controller with analog triggers, you are not playing the game correctly, but for those who don't have them they should be able to navigate menus effectively with a mouse.Do NOT buy this game if you do not meet the RECOMMENDED requirements (if you have any doubts, give the demo a try). As a 360 port, this game was built to run on certain hardware, and if you don't have the hardware, it will perform VERY poorly. For some reason, the game engine is tied to a 60 fps framerate, and if you dip below that (believe me, if you don't meet the recommended requirements you will not reach 60 fps) the game suffers from severe stuttering, rendering it unplayable for some. With limited graphical settings to mess with, this isn't a problem you can fix, and it doesn't seem to be a problem Ubisoft or RedLynx is willing to address.If you meet the recommended requirements, you should absolutely buy this game. It is a perfect blend of developed gameplay with great arcadey elements with great online leaderboard integration. The multiplayer has some problems, but the mere fact that they let you play user-generated tracks with your friends makes up for it as far as I am concerned. A robust track creator will keep the hardcore fans content for years to come. Its a shame that this version is bogged down by poor controls, UPlay, and a general laziness in porting the game engine."

With all the fun of going Skiiing on dirt, controlling a flying saucer, and riding on giant balls on the side.Gorgeous game with some amazing track design and properly tight controls and physics that lead you blaming only yourself when you fall off a cliff and have a truck dropped on you.   A steady learning curve starts you with the basics and works you up to the near-impossible feats that give you some crazy sense of ""**** YEAH, I JUST DID THAT!"" when you finally get it some 300 failures later.And that's just before you get into the track editor that has people out there making Basketball games, and full blown 3D flying simulators.

Trial Bike was the game that was fun to fail at just to see those amusing ragdoll physics. Besides that, it consisted of the player attempting to get their rider across a two dimensional course. Trials Evolution is merely an extension of this experience, but in a much more polished and intriguing format.There are two modes; career, as well as online and local multiplayer, all of which have a level of depth that was not realized in the free yet fun to play Trial Bike. Career mode sees your rider climb the tiers of your motorcycle licencing system by running test courses for D, C, B, and A class licences respectively. After you complete a licence, you get to participate in a series of tracks that will test the skills you’ve learned while progressing through your licences. These tracks range from beautiful back country vistas to more classic settings like warehouses and construction sites, each are beautiful in their own way. The game has just built on the foundation that its predecessor has laid, not losing its identity along the way. The level of fun you will have while playing Trials evolution are doubled from Trial Bike, with the inclusion of stellar graphics, a fitting heavy alternative rock sound track, and a deep level of rider and bike customisation. You can also play player modded tracks that can often offer a higher level of challenge. Another thing that is charming in its own way is the way that your rider will shout “YEEEEEEAAAAAAHHHHH!” and exclaims in other ways that’ll put a smile on your face while you pull off big airs and flips.Trials Evolution Gold Edition on the pc is a dream both visually and in terms of playability. Keyboard and gamepad work perfectly, and it’s likely that you’ll be maxing out all the graphical bells and whistles while maintaining at least sixty frames per second on a decent rig. While playing split screen multiplayer one player can use keyboard controls while the other uses the gamepad. If you have two gamepads then both players can use them.Trials Evolution Gold provides a unique driving experience that cannot be replicated elsewhere in the world of videogames, provides a tremendous amount of good old fun and is a beautiful thing to look at. I urge you to pick this up on Steam or Uplay at full price or if there’s a sale going on even better. Even if you’re not into motorsport in the slightest you will not regret buying this for the hours of fun you’ll receive out of it.10/10Also note that sometime early in the second quarter of 2014 (April 24th) the sequel will be released: Trials Fusion, which promises more of the same but with upgraded visuals I hope, and a whole slew of new tracks set in various settings not featured in this installment such as deserts snow peaked mountains and what looks like futuristic cities. You can pre-order it now if you know you want it."

That said, if you have an Xbox 360 go ahead just buy it on the there instead, because you'll have a much smoother experience and there are different map packs you can buy which add a lot of variety to the tracks currently on offer (If you want to try the HD maps available on Trials Gold on xbox too, you can download Trials HD).If you buy it on PC just be aware you might possibly run into bugs frequently, and if that's something that will ruin your experience, I'd say you probably shouldn't buy this despite my recommendation."

Tons of missions to complete, plenty of controller-throwing-rage-inducing moments. The real reason I'm leaving this review is because of the people ♥♥♥♥♥ing about UPlay. UPlay is a digital distribution and digital rights management platform. Exactly the same as Steam.Here are my idling stats: Steam spawns about 5 helper processes. The two big ones use 100-150 Mb of RAM each. The main Steam client constatly hogs 1-20% of my CPU. Nothing ridiculous, but it's there. UPlay runs at 0% CPU, no matter what I'm running. It also uses about 90 Mb. For it's backup processes (3 of them), they each use about 30-50 MB of Ram, with no CPU drain. So addressing the comments about it's intrusiveness and instantly-♥♥♥♥-up-everything quality - what?Another completely neutral point about UPlay - it's a DRM client, just like Steam. Unless you *only* get your games from Steam (if you are, stop), you realize how common it is for websites to sell keys that don't link to Steam. Hell I have several AAA titles that are on UPlay, not Steam.

Getting only Gold medals is going to take you a long, long time. The goal of Trials is to get your motorbike to the other side of the track as fast as possible and, if possible, without falling. The tracks are 2.5D, so it's all 3D but you'll be riding in one direction. Like I said, it looks simple, and it starts off simple, but gets hard really fast and certain tracks will take you hours, maybe even days, to master.The tracks, by the way, look awesome and are cleverly made. The game in general looks pretty sweet, but it does suffer from the occasional FPS drops, without good reason. Messy, but forgivable.Restarting a checkpoint or track is pretty much instant, which is important for a game like this. You'll keep playing and playing until you won that one bike or finished that one tournament. It's really addictive. In a good sort of way.I'd gladly recommend Trials.

I love the Trials series, and am a huge fan of this particular game... on Xbox.  You'd think the PC version would be better - especially since this series started on PC, right?  ... right?Wrong:  PC version of Evolution does not contain the DLC available for the XBLA version, nor is it available at all.  Including the tracks from HD was nice - but why leave the rest out?Ah, Ubisoft.  They'd sooner correct you on your interpretation of their carefully crafted misleading statements than actually address a consumer issue.  That's exactly what they've done here in the forums.  #effubisoftI bought this game on Steam because I wanted to replay one of my favorites, taking full advantage of the better hardware on my PC.  To some degree, that's what I got - the game (mostly) runs at 60 fps @ 1080p - which is great and all - but this version suffers from some real problems... and let's face it - this is Ubisoft we're talking about.  They have no intentions of fixing them.The Problems:- Uplay (the creamy filling inside Satan's♥♥♥♥♥pimples)- Poor optimization: stuttering  (bad in a game of skill)- Graphical glitches: mainly all the sprites on screen flickering in unison (distracting in a game of skill)- Poor multiplayer functionality (some of the most fun I've had with T:E on Xbox is with multiplayer)- Social media integration that can't be turned off (some might see this as a plus, but I see it as Ubisoft listening too much to focus groups - if I wanted to do stuff like post my replays to youtube, I'd buy a bloody capture card - and nobody I know wants to see the facebook logo in between every match.)- As stated above, DLC was never released despite ""Gold Edition"" title and misleading statement about ""all"" content being included.  (As a developer pointed out, the statement was not technically inaccurate - but as many forum-goers have said, the statement is all too easy to misinterpret, especially given industry conventions.)- Uplay (Uplay)"

The game's concept is fantastic, the visuals are serviceable, and the game would be fantastically fun and hilarious IF. Now let's get the bad:* Extremely unstable. The most unstable experience I've ever had. Crashes dozens of times a day, even if you turn off Uplay settings and play on lowest quality. Compatibility mode doesn't help. (I use Windows 10 and an i7-6700 but no dedicated GPU.) The shadows can completely break too and won't be fixed until you restart the game. Almost 100% of crashes happen inside menus; so if you give even half a damn, look into that, somebody.* The button layout and UI combination is abysmal. The gas button is used heavily in menuing and you are constantly doing things you didn't mean to do and didn't know you could do because of the terrible buttons.* The difficulty is so badly understood by the game that no matter what difficulty the game says the challenge is, it's a total crapshoot as to how difficult it actually is. In fact, getting gold in some events is nearly impossible, and the tournaments are so difficult that the lack of a ""restart whole tournament"" button is astounding. I'd bet a ton of money very little testing was done to see how difficult these challenges would be and what menu options would help lower the frustration. On top of this, your goddamned medals are based on how FAST you beat the challenges. That's so stupid it hurts. If you don't know what's wrong with that, then you clearly haven't played this game. People want to be rewarded for the clever thinking that will allow them to FINISH the course with minimal to no crashes, and maybe be rewarded for how many flips they can do because of the focus on bike stability. It doesn't even reward you for saving yourself from a crash. Where's the love for creativity?! That's what this game is all about!! People do NOT want to be rewarded for how fast they can make it to the end. That would be goddamned stupid! So basically, you're punished for creativity, and you're also punished for not being absolutely perfect, in the way THEY wanted you to be perfect. What the hell?!* The game can have a 320 x 200 resolution, but it maxes at 1366 x 720p. What. Why?! It's an Xbox 360 to PC port, dumbasses! Could you even put the SLIGHTEST effort into this port?! I have to lower the resolution of my 1080p monitor just to play well, because this game is too unforgiving to play on a tiny window. There is also no borderless mode.* This game is cynical to its audience as all hell. It uses the universally-hated and pointless DRM software Uplay, and there are TONS of problems with Uplay. Game activation, Steam syncing, stability, you name it. This game also has some of the worst, most cynical and untalented theme songs I've ever heard, custom written for this game. It's rap about the game from some obnoxious-sounding, talentless hack, and it has god-awful lyrics. It matters to me because it shows how badly the developers thought of their audience-- or at the least the cynical cheesiness of ""let's try to be hip for the kids!"". . .I want to love this game, but this game doesn't love me. It hates me. It feels rushed, it hates creative solutions to the courses, and it's so unstable and poorly maintained that I can barely believe it.Ubisoft, I don't want a refund. I want a patch. A big one. F**king fix this game. Or make yet another Trials game-- this time with high stability, 1080p, windowed and borderless modes, intuitive frustration-free menuing, no microtransactions (I'll accept DLC though), and a much bigger score for flips, saves, and crashless runs than for speed.

Other than playing with people you know, I cannot see any incentive to play this game. The biggest problem is probably that it's a relatively bad port considering the way it works. I can understand when GTA IV doesn't play well because it's very CPU intensive, but when Trials Evolution, a game that is played ENTIRELY in stages with relatively small environments lags on my laptop that will plays Crysis 2 on Ultra at 40fps, it can be kind of concerning. It doesn't lag on my rig at home, but the lag is only one of the problems. Playing without friends can become EXTREMELY frustrating, some of the tracks are INCREDIBLY hard, and while you can't really knock a game for being difficult, there is a certain point in which challenging simply turns to frustrating. Gameplay wise it's very fun until you find a map that's almost entirely broken, like the one where they swap your bike with skies while you try to ski down dirt and concrete and wood, and the physics on this map are completely broken. Why is a game like this so inconsistent? I don't know, the game just seems to be good when it could be AMAZING."

I was eager to give this new game a try since it has been exclusive to the xbox. Overall it's a great game, the underlining mechanic is still solid and very enjoyable, the addition of the skill course where you do silly stuff and eaaily access user generated content makes this feel fresh. However, the included Uplay DRM is terrible, you have to make an account with Ubisoft, the game load it everytime you play and instead of steam achievements and cloudsave, Ubisoft decided to do it themselves. Most of the time the cloud save works but I've had instance where it didn't save my progress (only lost 1 or 2 track). Achivements are useless since no one see it and it burry in the terrible UI. The worst thing about Uplay though is the unresponsiveness of the server, the game attempt to save your score after everytrack and it can take anywhere from 5 to 30 s because it has to sync with the server, it basically killed the momentum of the game especially when you just want to jump right back in. User generated contents are awesome but it also very slow and laggy to browse and download. I have to sadly give this amazing game a no for recommendation. If Ubisoft come to their sense and get rid of the terrible Uplay this game is a must own."
76561197991439419,Not Recommended,220160,8688692,"Posted: 12 January, 2014",all,ReRe McGaytron,"So I think I've played this game enough at this point to give an honest opinion.This game sucks.  Let's go through the reasons why.1.  The graphics - Okay so the graphics aren't terrible, the problem lies in the game engine.  You'll have to force your video card to run at full throttle if you have a modern graphics card.  For whatever reason this game will not trigger full utilization of my graphics cards.  Another huge problem is that textures pop in and out, from blurry to sharp.  Objects will pop as well.  This makes this game very irritating to play since you need to see the things in front of you in order to know how to approach the next jump.  This brings us to our next problem.2. The camera - I understand that this is a console port, and like every other crappy Ubi console port it suffers.  This was evidenced in the graphics and is also apparent in the view with which the game is presented in.  It's essentially like a 3D version of the NES classic Excitebike where the view is from the side.  However, the viewing angle is schewed a little more toward 70 - 80 degrees.  This is very annoying and does not allow you to complete many of the levels on the first attempt.  Granted the levels are divided into segments via checkpoints which you can ""reset"" to when you inevitably crash.  Which brings us to...3.  Level Design - Get ready for some of the most repetitive gameplay ever, with only very small variations on the gas / lean / jump theme.  Some levels have some humor to them, and at the end of every track your guy dies in assorted fashions, but the novelty wears off.  Some of the levels are just plain infuriating, having predetermind events that affect the layout of the course, often with varying results.  Speaking of varying results...4.  Physics - Or complete lack thereof.  I still can't figure out why your bike sometimes will act as if it has weight to it like a real motorcycle, yet other times its as if it is floating on a single point that refuses to stabilize.  For example, you can land a jump and your bike seems to be planted and you can give it gas and it responds as it should.  Another time you can land off that same jump and your bike is almost uncontrolable and just wants to flip backwards no matter how delicate you apply the gas.  It makes no sense and ruins the game very easily.5. - Controls - Quite possibly my biggest complaint with this game.  So you control the balance of the bike with gas, brake, and lunge/lean.  I say lunge/lean and not just lean because there is no way for you to gently lean your bike forward.  Any bit of input toward the right results in your rider thrusting his face over the handlebars.  Which interferes with blancing landings and climbing wills since this motion will pull your back wheel off the ground and usually results in an endo.6. - Uplay - Is a joke.  If you've ever had to use Uplay then you understand.  Whats the point of buying the game on Steam if we're forced to use Uplay?Save yourself some money and go find an old copy of Motorcross Madness.  That is a much more entertaining game and is over a decade old.  Oh and textures won't pop in and out..."

Regardless of if you can tollerate uplay or not uplay is a plague, uplay ruins gaming experiance and uplay takes advantage of Steam. Either stick to uplay or rely on Steams DRM. uplay games on Steam are going to be the death of Steam.If you can overlook or tollerate uplay restricting your access to your games constantly thehn this is great buy. As it's a very simplistic yet addictive game to pick up when you have nothing else to play. However I can't stand uplay."

This is probably the only game by Ubisoft that made me not slam my face into my keyboard. The game makes a pretty good first impression. You click play and some kickass rock n' roll music fills the main menu. After customizing your rider with a variety of colors, it's time to hit the track!The controls are very easy to master: arrows keys. That's it. The game feels like those old Flash games with the little biker trying to get to the other side of the screen. There are 2 campaigns to play, one consisting of a variety of motocross (and non-motocross events that don't even involve a bike) and the other campaign taking place in a warehouse full of explosions, and you're driving in the middle of it. The difficulty of this game creates a wonderful challenge for such a simple game!The game engine seems to work somewhat well, and the level editor even allows you to make more than tracks with motorcycles. For example, there is an entire campaign consisting of random minigames, one involoing making a metal ball roll down a pipe. There are glitches in the game like the bike floating on top of track instead of the wheels fully touching the ground and falling through tracks, but they are rather rare. The Steam connection breaks when you try to enter multiplayer, but quick matches work fine. Downloading the game also requires downloading Uplay (Ubisoft's version of Steam that is a pain).In conclusion, this addicting game is fun to play, but the normal price is way too high. The game seems to only be a good buy when I got it at the Holiday Sale.I'll give it an 8.5/10Stay tuned for more reviews!"

There is no other game out there (or atleast done this good) in this genre, and Trials just also happened to hit the nail on the head. The physics doesn't make it seem like your floating about space, and the graphics are just good enough so that they don't detract from the gameplay. However, this game is not completely flawless. Trials, which was originally made for the Xbox Live Arcade, really works well on Xbox with the analog sticks, but not so much on PC. At times, the arrow controls seem a bit unresponsive, and brings out the other big issue; rage. It's not the developers fault, however, but I am just warning you that there will be some form of rage once you get to the harder tracks.

Kind of poor difficulty escalation quickly turns from casual fun to extremely challenging, but it's still pretty fun for the most part.  Looks great, but is very badly optimized. Has five unlockable bikes, but the fourth is a barely controllable sidegrade and the fifth is literally a joke. Driver and bike customization are okay, and give you color editors. Uses an online service called Uplay, which makes you sign up for another frickin' account somewhere, has a bizarre multiplayer interface, and is apparently prone to forgetting your accomplishments. Casual multiplayer with a friend is good fun without sweating the results much, though. Plenty of slapstick humor with your post-race, and sometimes mid-race, ragdoll, and some non-dirt-bike jackass events thrown in for good measure. So, mostly a good time, sometimes an infuriating time, with some noticable flaws and subpar computer efficiency, but overall, pretty okay."

I purchased this game already for the Xbox 360 when it came out and had a great time with it. Since I loved it so much I bought it a second time so I can play it on my PC. I made a mistake thinking I'd get the same experience with this version.Unfortunately it was a $20 poorly invested. This is a shantily put together PC port. Despite my machine having more than enough power to run this game, I can't even get this thing to run at my monitor's native resolution (1920x1080). I've done research and found this has to due with cards that can't run DirectX11. Only the thing is, my card DOES run Dx11, so that doesn't make sense.Even so, running it at a vastly lower resolution, the game is still choppy, ugly and unplayable. Throw in the fact that you have to run this crap using Ubisoft's crappy Uplay software, I find it extremely difficult to recommend this product to PC gamers.If you own a console, buy it on there.

,Recommended,220160,2932590,"Posted: 12 June, 2013",all,Sammy,"This game is amazing, but before you get it, here's why you should wait:The game is played through Uplay, so you have to download Uplay when you download Trials. Uplay is EXTREMELY BUGGY and in some cases won't work at all, and if Uplay doesn't work, neither will Trials. They ARE working to fix it, but I don't think it will be any time soon.Next, Trails is a poorly ported Xbox360 game, so they are STILL doing bug fixes. Even on the highest end computers it will have a jitter effect, because the game is locked on 60 fps (Which is good if it's on a console, not if it's on a computer.) They ARE working on a fix, but I doubt it will work the first try so it will be a while before they get it sorted out, if at all. For me, the jitter effect is small enough that the game is playable, but it still annoys me.Here's why you SHOULD buy it:The game is amazing, the graphics are great for such a simple game, and the customization in the game is astounding. The game can be a lot of things, it's not just a motorcycle game, there are plenty of options to choose from. The online gameplay is really smooth, and connection problems don't seem to be an issue from what I've seen. Singleplayer has tons of gameplay put into it, and it does have a level of difficulty, but not enough to leave you stuck. It makes sure you are putting some effort into it, though, which is very nice for a game. It certaintly isn't a waste of money, and I'm sure it will be expanded on and improved, especially with bug fixes and whatnot."

You get to ride bikes, but in special challenges there are also other modes of transportation like skis. There is a ""main campaign"" of sorts but there are also user made tracks. The gameplay is fast and it is easy to restart if you mess up.After each run of a track, you get either a bronze, a silver or a gold medal, and the gold medals are usually relatively easy, so ""winning"" becomes a matter of setting the best time. However here is one problem: the leaderboards are lead by cheaters. You can watch their replays and see that they did not even finish their races, let alone set a record. Two questions immediately beg to be asked: 1. why have the developers not addressed this problem? and 2. What's the point of cheating like that? We can clearly see that you have not finished first but last. You have achieved nothing. Why would you want to prove to everybody that your are a loser?Anyway, the music is good. Well, either you will actually like it or appreciate how stylish and silly it is. It's that teenage extreme sports music. The graphics are ok too.

I only wish it was longer, had more bikes and had more customization.I'm not going to go into how much of a fan I am of this series or how I've put hundreds of hours into each game simply to just keep this short and sane since I'm a bit of a blabber mouth.But basically, this game has a ton of performance issues, it feels really good sometimes, solid 60FPS then.....BAM, the FPS is all over the place and the game feels choppy and delays your moves and it stutters between smooth and choppy and it will completely throw you off and cause your demise 90% of the time. I have a pretty decent system and I'll put the specs near the bottom for people interested but I should not be getting these kinds of problems with a PC this decent, one I can play GTA V with much smoother.The game is good, the physics are top notch, the controls are solid and that's what I play this game for but it all gets thrown out the window with the performance issues. The game can even play perfectly fine but the second you restart the match, bam, stuttering or choppy FPS, and sometimes even in an area with nothing happening the game can be choppy but in areas with♥♥♥♥♥♥blowing up and buildings falling the FPS is rock solid. It seems to be CPU dependant as changing the video options doesn't do much of anything.UPlay is a non-problem for me, never has been a problem, some people just have ♥♥♥♥♥♥ luck, or in this case, a lot of people have terrible luck but from the very get go since that hell spawn's birth, never had issues with UPlay in any Ubi title I own, just had problems with the games. Stating this since some people seem to hate on UPlay for no reason but to hate on it and 50% of the reviews are talking about it.Why do I recommend this game if it has performance issues? Because it's a REALLY good game, one I come back to all the time owning the games on Xbox 360 and PC and I know it's probably just my dumb luck the game is programmed poorly for my CPU even though others have the same problems. The 360 version is sadly smoother albeit at a lower FPS. Even if I lock this game at 30FPS, it still stutters and gets choppy.

I always find myself coming back to this game, and despite already getting gold on every track is till find that i have just as much fun trying to improve my times as i did when i first started playing."

It runs at 60 fps, but if it drops below that at all, you will see major stuttering which makes the game unplayable.  If you don't have any frame drops, which only happens on occasion, the game is a blast.  It's all about timing, and that's what makes it fun.  It really is a good game, but until they optimise it, it's really a bummer.  Even with the major frame issue, I still think it's worth the money."

Other than that, there isn't anything here, but there doesn't need to be, and shouldn't be. The game is really fun to play, though sometimes frustrating, and it's got some great music to go with it. Overall, defintately a positive experience here. Of course, if you have issues with Uplay, which I never have even though I don't really like it, this could end up being a trap for you."

76561198007789156,Recommended,220160,29728707,Posted: 5 February,all,Yamadog32,"If you are a person with excellent eye hand/finger coordination then this game is for you. If you like platformer puzzles and you have said eye hand skills then this game is for you. If you are just average or a little less skilled like me then you will have fun up to a point and then hit the wall with this game.Real world Trials is nothing like this game. I doubt anybody know what ""trials"" is as a motorsport. That does not matter for this game. You have a bike and you need to complete courses within a time limit to get medals to advance through the game. Medals get you new tracks and bikes. You earn money but it has no point other than you can buy parts to make your bike look different. They do nothing for performance so you can ignore them if you want.The game is fun. You get big air on some jumps. You can do back/forward flips all you want. It does nothing for your score but its fun and thats the point. There are some odd challenges like skiing on dirt, or trying to do a course with the throttle stuck wide open on your bike.The game rewards your own gifted skills if your are skilled. You have complete control of your bike and rider and far as brakes and throttle. You dont turn in this game so cornering is out. Your rider has a huge effect on the bike balance. The rider can lift the front or rear wheels off the ground just by leaning forward or backwards. This is how you conquer the the challenges. This is my most serious complaint about the handling of the game. You control the rider with the left stick on your game pad. It is super sensitive. I wish I could slow that down like mouse sensitivity in other games. So when you move him up or back he yanks the bike a bunch. Like I said I am not in the top 10% of skilled people.The game is fun. You crash a lot but you will make unbelievable saves that make you shout out loud. I got it cheap and played it a lot over the holidays but when I fired it up later on I just got frustrated."

From now please read Uplay or origin as ""steam actually sold you nothing"" . So yeah don't buy there at least. Steam should mention at the very least that the key might not work on origin or uplay, it's not fair to the consumer."
