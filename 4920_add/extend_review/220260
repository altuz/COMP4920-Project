This game isn't for everybody, but that doesn't mean it's a bad game. If you like relaxing, slow paced, and somewhat realistic simulators, give this one a look. There are over a hundred different vehichles, and tons of different features. It's also fully moddable, with a thriving modding community. It's bug free, and runs on relatively low end machines. Works on my four year old rig."

Even if you laugh at the concept, it's worth a try if you're after a chillout game but have played Minecraft to death.One thing I would say is that the time you need to invest before you start getting the cool equipment is pretty steep, but there are things you can buy that passively earn money and mean you can earn more than you spend on production."

I’ve played this, the 2011, and the 2009 versions for many countless hours.As background, I have a graduate degree in agriculture economics and have spent a good portion of my life farming.  By all accounts, I should dislike this game:* the controls are clunky* the physics are often aggravating* the particle flow/dust and other graphical elements are a throwback to 1990’s 3D engines* the ‘farming’ elements are incredibly simplistic and the economics are silly.And yet there is something oddly cathartic and relaxing about this game that keeps me coming back for more day after day.I derive the most enjoyment from utilizing some of the many modifications to stretch this game to its limits.  The most important is Courseplay, which allows me to automate most of the tasks and play a managerial role, even though the game it technically a driving simulator.  I also enjoy user-submitted maps, such as Paradise 2013, which are set up for larger operations and automated farming.Even though I wish the developers would license a better game engine so that the physics, rendering, and particle flow are more realistic, as well as include an 'advanced' mode that actually adjusts growth conditions and incorporates specific pests/weeds that I have to control, I can’t help but think that I’ll keep playing this game for a long time to come."

From the visually stunning detail on every tractor, to the joy of harvesting that last potato, this game had it all. Want to plant some corn? Go for it! Feel like selling some eggs? You can do that too! The possibilities are endless when you're running your own farm. Why not play with friends? Feel the excitement when you and your buddies connect over the internet webs and spend hours cultivating your first crops. You will never run out of things to do with an extensive range of different sized fields. Form a clan and take on the annual MLG Farming Simulator 2013 Internationals to compete against the top teams of farmers around the world. Need to get somewhere in a hurry? Just steal a golf cart from the local golf club, and even crash it into a lake.  If that's not enough, Titanium Edition comes with 4 new maps and the urban camo assault crossbow. Pick up a copy of game of the year edition and become eligible for Double XP weekends and gain access to the Farming Simulator 2014 multiplayer beta upon release. So what are you waiting for?

,Recommended,220260,12830846,"Posted: 7 November, 2014",all,Silversnake,"Now that the new Farming Simulator 15 has come out, its high time to write down my personal thoughts of 2013 Titanium.This is a game sim about running a modern farm. You get 2 maps to start with, Hagenstedt and Westbridge Hills. The game started off with Hagenstedt, but more content and Westbridge Hills was added later in the Titanium upgrade.So what do you do at your farm?You grow crops, manage ure animals and do missions to put it simply.The crops that you can grow are: Wheat, Barley, Canola, Sugar Beets and Potatoes.The animals you can have are: Cows, Sheep and Chickens.There is also two type of missions you can do: Transport Missions and Mowing.You can freely choose how you play the game, and can freely roam on the map, doing what you like. If you only wanna grow crops, for example, thats just fine.Pros:- The free playstyle, doing what you want, when you want.- Multiplayer. This game is made for it, you can have tons of fun with ure friends working together on the farm.- Loads of equipment. From plows to harvesters.- Easy to learn and get into.- Literally TONS of mods to further enhance your gameplay!Cons:I really cant say bad things about the game, but no game is perfect.- The handling of some machines are wonky and hard to control (but you get used to it.)- Easy to get stuck in fences/rocks and stupid Ai cars. (Fortunately there is a reset function for ure equipment if it flips over or get stuck.)- It sometimes feels like your alone in a empty world just driving your machines in single player. There is Ai cars and people, but still feels empty. (Multiplayer fixes that.)My personal Thoughts:This is one of my favorite types of sim games. The playstyle is relaxed and easy. Might be a bit stressful at harvest time, but other than that, its really a great game. The game flows well, atleast in single player. Lag issues and small freezes can occur in multplayer, but thats not the game´s fault. I had some great fun farming with my friends. Its a perfect co-op game to work at your farm and earn cash for new machinery and expanding your farm.The game has plenty of machines and equipment to choose from and isnt that enough, there is a great mod community that offers tons of mods of all sorts from new maps and new equipment to gameplay mechanics.This is a great game if u like farming sim games. The new one is out, but i recommend to get this new ""classic"" too."

I tend to prefer this version to the 2015 version because I am not a fan of the logging focus that was forced into 2015.

Regardless, they are both EXCELLENT games for those that enjoy an open play style and empire building style. A relaxing and enjoyable experience all around.The Modding community behind these games is AMAZING. If you can imagine it, then someone, somewhere has probably built it.

First off, my biggest gripe is that it is NOT a farm simulator. There is no element of acually farming except for the equipment... And that's what it really is; a tractor driving simulator. Sure you can plow and spray and blah blah, but none of that really has any affect on the actual yield of a field. Should I plow before I drill? Doesn't matter, you'll get the same yield. Is it going to rain? Doesn't matter, you'll get the same yield. Also, other ""farming"" elements such as weed and pest control are absent.Having said all that, you can drive a variety of equipment for quite a few tasks such as drilling, mowing, raking, blah blah. It's an okay game if you like that sort of thing. I picked it up cheap and I feel I got my moneys worth, but if it were any more money and I'd not have recommended it."

No bloodshed, no thrills except of running out of money, questionable challenges... Yet, surprisingly, it's working as the game! Gripping with it's charming simplicity of the peaceful farm life and basic routine to make the day!After trying Agricultural Simulator: Historical Farming recently, I was expecting everything bad from this game. Surprisingly, I was wrong. In fact, Farming Sim 2013 is really decent enough farming simulator - making you an operator of various farmers tools, starting from tractor with plough or fertilizer attached, going with mowers, harvesters, and even a trailer truck to get your stuff to the buyer.You're not get your hands dirty there, there is no actual manual labor (except of picking up eggs, maybe). All that you're supposed to do is to dig up the ground, sow it, fertilize, harvest and prepare the new planting. All by using different vehicles and attachments. And you're not even have to do all those works yourself! There are always convinient farmhand to dig some earth for you. Also there are some passive income sources: bee nests, greenhouses and solar panels - in the end, Farming Sim 2013 can be quite a good idling game. Just plant some stuff here and there, leave it be, and after some days passed, voila! - you're a millionaire! And that's not even a joke.As of downsides, the simulation is far from well-being and from reality in many aspects, starting from engine and physics, going with visuals, stupid gameplay challenges, unhelpful tutorials and so on. It is working - sure, but there is a big question, if you're gonna like it or not.If you're not minding just riding the tractor across countryside, performing some basic tasks here and there - that's good point. If you were ever wandering, what all those variety of tractors and combines are made for - you'll get a proficient picture.If you, however, play the games for thrills and hard challenges - that's not the right title. If you're gonna make yourself a farmer - you're not gonna find much useful info there, as well, as it's all not even covering the basics of the real farmwork.Still, again, as a simulator of farming life - it's working nice enough. Peaceful game, with achievements to unlock and fields to harvest. My mark is 6.5/10.PS: can't vouch for DLCs - they're pretty much the same, except of landscape"
,Recommended,220260,15607309,"Posted: 29 April, 2015",all,raw1990,"I give a thumbs up to the ""Farming Simulator"" franchise.The reasons are:1- Its absolutly relaxing gameplay, the closest you can get to nature without leaving the house.2- It is by far the most deep game that can still be played ""passivly"", meaning you can fullfil other life duties such as reading/ studying and still enjoy this game in the background.3- Has enough activities to engage you when you have more time and choose to play more ""activly"".4- Even provides multiplayer to enjoy with friends!5- Very educational for urban people like me who never even knew a thing or 2 about farming.I will gladly recommend all the versions even today: 2011, 2013, 2015 every game has a set of achievments and the older it is the more basic the gameplay is. So if you are new to the franchise you can happily start from the oldest one but if you are looking for eye candy of course the newer look better ;)"

By the title you can probably tell it is do with farming and that just what it is. From most simulators I have played this is the most polished and better designed compared to the rest. For me I didn't really know to much about farming and wouldn't be able to tell you a peice of equipment if you asked me about it but after playing this game I began to learn about the equipment and how it was used. It was more of learning excerise I had than a game but it was fun playing with couple of friends here and there if there was nothing else to do. Its not a game I would say have to play but if you and couple of mates are bored I would suggest all getting it and giving it a try. The price at £29.99 is a bit steep.. well.. very steep but I got it on sale when it was under £10 so I didn't pay but if you want to give it a try with mates not that fun to play alone. I would rate this 7/10 not because its a really good game but because of the enjoyment I had with it with friends not best buy but if you have nothing better to do give it a shot.

The extraordinary thing is the title is a bland, no bells and whistles sim.So what's the attraction?Initially, starting with 1 paddock on the stock map and a small amount of equipment provides an impetus to do what farmers do. Plant, reap, sell, expand. But it doesn't take long to learn the quirks and the cash points so ""expansion"" and accummulation of wealth becomes kinda pointless soon enough.The scenery can be special, the fields and textures quite mundane. Equipment modelling is very nice. The AI can be quite stupid at times (but I couldn't imagine playing this without them) and it's got a definite farm feel. On it's own, it might get 300-400 hours to dedicated tycoon-sim fan.So what is it? What made me do (and will probably continue) over 1200+ hrs of playtime?FS2013, to me, is all about the mods. New maps, new equipment, new fruits, new animals and new ways to do things are offered by a very dedicated modding community and have been since the game first released.The ability to connect the dots to create any specific industry on the farm has increased exponentially. New animal mods, such as the piggery, provide for a very diverse form of infrastructure modelling to run successfully. From grain to root vegetables to water to straw to mixed rations and onwards.Giants themselves have done very little to gameplay and it took them 12 months to release a new map and some new equipment, along with an engine update. They have not added new animals or fruits and even the new farm and new equipment was a DLC purchase. Pretty poor tbh, given the money made (and continues) from this, one of the most popular farming sims out there.Mod it up and it's worth every single cent and will remain a stalwart amongst the box of games we call sims.7/10 unmodded.9/10 modded.gg"

Essentially, this game focuses on all the things that bored me when I was a farmer years ago. Plowing seemingly endless fields, before preparing and seeding them again. However, it is a beautifully created game and just not my cup of tea. There is nothing functionally wrong with the game, the level of detail and quality of mods are excellent. I suspect also that if I could stomach playing for a few more days solid I might get more bang for my buckHowever, I have a job and the last thing I want to come home and do after a long day at work is go back to work and plow the fields for a few hours! Sorry, I just found this game intensely dull, it's not overly complex. Plant, harvest, plow, prepare. When you've repeated that, buy some more fields and do it again.I don't know what I was expecting, perhaps something a little more fun like the old days of Sim Farm which had a bit more pace to it.

Indie platformers are the sugary deserts, 2D fighters are the alternate pasta entree, and MOBAs are the pizza the loud guys upstairs are having.THIS game is like the nap you have after eating too much.

They really help in counter balancing increased running/maintaining equipement costs.For me on the later games playing on hard mode, prices are much lower so you have to work for a longer time to fix yourself financially, This challenge is most fun when i take a Million $ loan from the bank and sell every starting vehicle, I buy 1 decent tractor, 1 decent harvester, 1 mid/large trailer, 1 good seeder which does not require the soil to be cultivated first, and 1 extra field, number 17 on hagenstadt.Sow plant harvest, rinse and repeat, Store tons of canola because that has the highest pricesbut generally try to store as much as you can of the varieties you can place using that 1 seeder, which are wheat,barley,canola,or grass,  but we can forget the grass as it is not useful at the start.When there is a great demand for a certain product sell everything you have stored of that type at the correct location for max Profit.Get myself out of debt, But continue using this method but with an increasingly larger bundle of toys that you can buy now you are making million!Love this game, but Farming isnt for everyone."

When I'm playing this I can take time building my own farm. No trying to out run zombies or getting to pole position here. The game is sandbox and pretty much leaves you to run the farm how you feel fit. As you earn money you can invest it into new equipment, farm expansion and livestock. There is quite a good tutorial that explains how the various different vehicles in the game work. On top of that there are various mods around as well which further expand the game.The graphics are quite nice with weather changes and day / night cycles. Crop growing can take a while so fortunately there are options in the game such as time increase where you can speed things along. The scenery is quite nice and rural. There is also a nearby village with people and traffic so you feel more like part of a community.The vehicles themselves are quite detailed and its a bit like being a kid again where you get to play with all those farm toys. You can even hire workers for some and just stand by a field while watching them work on it.This won't be for everyone but if you are looking for a more laid back kind of sim that involves farming then this should do the job."

There are also seperate missions to boost your income, animals to tend, the continual feeding of grass clippings into the biogas plant which produces fertilizer for your crops, and an active modding community producing new maps and equipment to download and enhance gameplay.As other reviewers have illuded, as  much as I have enjoyed games like Minecraft and Skyrim over the years, this game has been a nice alternative to the constant stress of exploring creeper-infested mines and caverns, or having to fight for your life forever threatened by orcs, goblins, trolls, zombies, and every other horrific imaginings.

At first, it seems like a simple farming game, until out of nowhere there are North Korean soldiers overrunning your peaceful farm. Fighters and bombers soar overhead, aircraft drop legions of paratroopers onto the farmland you so meticulously tilled as you realize that you, a lone farmer, are the last line of defense from foreign invaders. You prepare for war by breaking out that rifle you kept to ward off thiefs, along with thousands of rounds of ammunition, rocket launchers, grenades, anti aircraft guns, and that Davy Crockett you kept for those special occasions. As you fight through your blood soaked little property, you must continue to make those crucial crop deliveries in order to help sustain the crumbling war effort. The delivery missions are brutal, as you must guide your tractor convoy to its destination through complex ambushes, IEDs, and indirect fire.

This game doesn't have that. It has farming equipment and a great environment for people looking for a relaxing evening or a great co-operative experience with friends who enjoy simulated farming with heavy equipment.Hours of fun: *Varies - If you like simulators then it may well be infiniteSuggested Retail Value: $20Graphics: 7/10Voice-acting: NA - No voice-actingMusic/SFX: NA - Calm music on menus onlyUniqueness: 5/10First Play-through Experience: 8/10Replay Value: 9/10If you have any love for simulated farming then I doubt you would regret paying up to $20 for the full version. I was introduced to the game through a friend who had put in 100s of hours and just convinced me to give it a try so I could experience what he loved so much about it. I didn't expect it to be this much fun, but it's a blast on co-op play.After a stressful day, I can sit back and relax and handle issues as they rise. Choosing to pace myself in the game by switching it to real-time and literally doing needed chores then watching the beautiful sunset or... whatever.Then, when I'm feeling ambitious, we both hop into our private server and divy up the tasks at hand, co-operating in beautiful harmony to bring our farm ever closer to being a mega-success.It's hard to describe how it feels to grow a farm from humble beginnings with one small field to a booming business with dozens of fields, 1000s of tons of equipment, and a ranch boasting hundreds of animals, but I highly recommend sharing it with friends.To help with that, the game has an incredible community. Whether you're looking to see the mods that are available, wanting to create your own, looking for a buddy to chat with while you drive the harvesters, or wanting to join a sever with dozens of players trying to achieve a shared farm (even splitting up the tasks, creating jobs, dolling out wages, the whole deal!) the truth is you'll find it all here.I say this about few games (Skyrim readily comes to mind) but FS 2013 feels less like a game and more like a world you visit for as long as you like. Highly recommended if the above sounds interesting to you."

Having to do manual work for a while, eventually, you work your way to owning atleast 20 fields (some are larger then others, and other maps have more of them). You even hire lots of workers to run your fields. I reccomend, finding some mods, and downloading more maps for the game."

,Recommended,220260,12737156,"Posted: 1 November, 2014",all,TommyK154,"I'm giving this game a contingent ""yes"". If you played FS2013, this is disappointing, if this is you're first time, then you'll like it. It's a good game overall but adds almost nothing in the 2 years since FS2013. Sure logging has been added but this is a game about farming, and very little has been done in the actual farming department.First off, let me say this is definitely FARMING simulator and not USING FARMING VEHICLES simulator. What I mean by that is the concept of farming, what to do and how to do it in terms of growing crops is solid. What's not solid is the actual gameplay of the vehicles. The physics is pretty bad. The vehicles have no weight to them, accelerate and decelerate instantly, and have horrible turning physics (I'm NOT referring to the turning when you are attached to a tool but do not have a counter-weight up front, that is good attention to detail, but turning in general is awful). The cockpits are alright, but nothing lights up, very few instrument gauges work, and nothing is clickable. A few new vehicles have been added, mostly those associated with the new tree logging though.Furthermore, nothing has been improved when it comes to growing crop. You still have the same options and equipment. You'd think the devs with all this time would add something new like beans or even vinevards or fruit trees, but no, same as FS2013. Same can be said for farm animals. Nothing changed. You also get the same side, repetitive side missions. This is a REAL big disappointment, 2 years and the devs can't even think of a new side mission?The world still feels so empty and unlived in. There is no sense of ""people"" living around you. If you go into the one town you might see a one or two people walking but that's about it. There is some traffic but its not convincing at all. There is no AI really and they drive at like 5 mph for some reason. I wish the game gave you a reason to use your lights and turn signals when on the road, but with such unbelieveable traffic there's no option in even pretending to role play.At this point you might be wondering why I'm recommending this game after saying only negative stuff about it. Well, if you haven't played FS2013, then you won't be so disappointed. The game itself is very fun and makes you think about how to manage your crop and sell it at the biggest profit. The little side missions are fun (considering you haven't played FS2013) for the first few hours and are a nice change for pace from normal farming. The graphics are generally nice and reasonably well-detailed. A nice touch added is that your tractor and farming equipment now get dirty with use and can be cleaned off with a pressure washer (although equipment gets dirty way too quickly). Overall it's a solid game, especially if this is your first time. If you ever see this on sale for $20 or less, I'd say definitely pick it up if you're interested. At full MSRP however, you should checkout some gameplay and really think about if this is the kind of game you'd enjoy. If you're someone who plays a lot of sim games, then the answer will probably be yes. If not, maybe wait for a sale to get the most fun/$ out of it"

I have played many Farming/Agricultural Simulator games previously and to date this game with over 150 hours of game play is my favorite of the Famring Simulators.  For me a good simulator must have a business simulation aspect to it.  And this game does a great job at that.  I enjoy the rewards of raising crops and animals to earn money in order to further grow my farm, buy land, buy animals and add more equipment.  The other aspect that this game really expands on is the mods.  Almost limitless modding.I would rank this simulation game just above Euro Truck Simulator 2.  Both are great simulation games and are in my top 15 simulation games of all time."

The trucks and equiptment are nice and there is quite a bit of variety, but it's definitely more of a game about vehicles and farming technicallities than planting crops or raising animals.  The low rating is only because it was not really advertised directly as such, and therefore I thought it might have more to do with animal husbandry etc.  Great game if you're into the other, technical, physical side of farming."

The nice, relaxing and serene environment of the country as you harvest many types of vegetables and fruit.  I am, of course, talking about the Harvest Moon series.This, however, is not Harvest Moon.  It can barely be classified as a game.  There are no goals, no physics and no one else on the farm.  I may just be a simple suburb folk but I'm pretty sure that realistic farms are a multiperson job even with tractors.Oh, yeah.  There are some people.  They drive in cars and don't seem to react at all when you drive your farming equipment over them or tip them over.   If you have some cash to spend, you could probably have a much more enjoyable time by going down to your local Sherwin Williams, buy some paint, toss it at your wall and watch it dry.

Carrying a pallet on your forklift and hit a bump, have fun chasing it down and spending the next 5 minutes lining your forks back up just right to load it up and have it sailing off into oblivion the next bump you hit. Get your sheep going, finally get a few pallets of wool together and loaded on the trailer? Make sure not to turn that trailer because, as we all know, any sort of turn sends your load flying off. Accidentally hit Q on your harvester? Better bring your forklift over to try to flip your implement for the next 10 minutes.Accidentally put grass in your hopper instead of grains, have fun tilling that field for the next half hour and never getting it quite right.It's just bad. It could be a great game but it just isn't. Models are great, the towns are OK, gameplay is decent aside from the just terrible physics.

Anything by Giants software you buy at your own risk. If it does not work they will not help you. They do not respond on their own technical support forum. They continue to put out sub par software and expect the community to fix it for them.Steam should be ashamed of themselves promoting software on their site that you can not get technical support for.I guess it is true that it is all about the buck and to hell with the customers.

There is no management, no depth, no challenge.The multiplayer is non - existant, though there seems to be a market for it. Some dedicated servers would be cool here. The level difficulty is awful. Easy is tutorial and far too easy to bother with. Normal is easy. Hard says - you start off in debt, workers cost more to hire. Okay, so going into the game I start off with a random 8000 dollars, I don't seem to have any debt or loan at all. Workers cost more to hire yes, but I hired them anyway and still got a profit. Also managed to sell my two useless tractors for 18,000. Then decided to open the shop, and oh....I can only buy the very most basic items, and only one type of some to do the entire map. This level isn't hard, its just pointless as you now cannot progress.Also, the devs seem to have plopped down this empty shell of a sim, and from then til now and forever, are just churning out dlc with new tractor bits from various companies. How about you add to the game more...?Other players put it well for me -''What I dislike is the fact that you start out with a really big farm in terms of buildings and stuff. I would so much like to build everything myself, just starting out with a small field and some equipment. I also miss seasons and crop rotations, as well as fatigue.While the game is somewhat shallow in terms of the overall mechanics,''''6.5/10. This game is great for someone who is REALLY into ploughing fields. I mean REALLY. The trucks and equiptment are nice and there is quite a bit of variety, but it's definitely more of a game about vehicles and farming technicallities than planting crops or raising animals. The low rating is only because it was not really advertised directly as such, and therefore I thought it might have more to do with animal husbandry etc. Great game if you're into the other, technical, physical side of farming.''"

After being surprised by the excellent Euro Truck Simulator 2, I was expecting sort of the same experience, only with cows and grain instead of long nightly drives through Germany. And with multiplayer! But I was let down…To be fair: the game can be fun, especially on a LAN with some friends, country music on the speakers and a bottle of Jack to pass around. And the models of the farming machines are pretty nice and detailed as well. However, many things simply are a let-down or maybe wasted potential. For example, the rear mirrors are not functioning, essentially making it impossible to play the game first person when driving. And don’t get me started about the dreadful physics engine powering it all: you will encounter gravity defying bouncing farming equipment at regular intervals (and pray those will not get stuck in the scenery). Also, there are no real management options: you can hire some dumb helping hands but that is about it. Even an ancient game like Sim Farm had this. And speaking of Sim Farm: why is there no option to actually upgrade the farm itself (beyond the buying of extra fields).Hopefully future versions will fix some of the issues I had with this game, since there is some great potential here. But for now I cannot really recommended it, unless it’s really cheap in some sale and you have some friends to enjoy it with."

Given there's a newer version out, this is a bargain. (Of course, why you'd even CONSIDER buying a new version is beyond me, once is truly, SURELY enough...)- It provides a very clear insight into the riveting, high octane world of farming!- lots of vehicles, accessories, things to load, unload, fill, plough etc (if that's your bag...)CONS:- I wanted to die while I played this...- It's a simulator about farming - and yep, you guessed it, it's 'somewhat' realistic. That means it's so frightfully boring and dull you'll have trouble stopping your brain from exploding.- There are in excess of 3000 people who own this game who gave it the thumbs up... Why is that a CON? Well... let's put it this way, the type of people who'd most likely give this a thumbs up probably like watching grass grow, and can't get enough of farming so they turn to a simulator to continue the experience into the evening. I'm shocked. Seriously I am.SUMMARY: It's not that the game is terrible. In fact, you could very reasonably argue that in playing a farming simulator, you need to set your expectations lower than a crack ho' turning tricks with Jack the Ripper. But here's the thing - even knowing it's a farming simulator, it still was so awfully dull, so painfully boring that I can't believe I played as long as I did.I mowed some grass at a golf course, I drove a tractor with a trailor perfectly lined up next to a harvester to catch wheat, then dumped said wheat in a grain silo, I took a load of peanuts to a place so they could attract a runaway elephant back (yep, you heard me right), i sold a tractor, I ploughed a field. Then I realised I was SPENDING MINUTES OF MY LIFE, JUST WASTING AWAY DOING THIS!!!!The tutorial was mildly amusing for 5 minutes, then the game just continues the awful, mind-sapping exercise.

In that, you have very clear objectives and above all else, a sense of purpose given to me by the game which I embraced.With Farming Simulator 2013, you kinda have to make your own game out of it, sort of like much of Mine Craft and those sort of games where you're given the tools to have fun, but no one really bothered to design a curated series of objectives and goals for you.

After getting out of the tutorial, I tried to start a mission, but somehow my tractor got stuck on a rock and I could not get it off.  This game has pretty bad physics, of course that is not the focus of the game, but getting stuck on stuff and not being able to get it off is a pain.Several times I took an attempt to like this game, but I could not get into it.  I cannot recommend this game to anyone, but to each their own."

I don't think it will appeal much to those that like nothing better than hack and slash, but if you have a bit of patience to see your crop grow this is the game for you!There are a few minor comments to make, though. I might be a city gal, but I do know that chickens do NOT feed themselves, and that a henhouse needs a door so that the chickens can actually get in to lay their eggs and keep them safe against Mr Fox! I haven't bought any sheep or cows yet, but from the manual I get the impression that not much work, apart from making fodder, is expected there either.Also, I doubt whether even the most dedicated farmer can do without any sleep at all.Secondly, the world of Farming is a bit 'dead', In the town and on the campsite there are a few people shambling about, but that's about it. There's never anyone on the golfcourse, or in any of the other fields. And where are the birds? Where are the crows?On the good side nature, landscape, sky and weather patterns are a joy to see and watch. Machinery and crop are beyond perfect. So, all in all, 9 points out of 10, and highly recommended, nevertheless!"

It has great graphics, good vehicle choice, and several methods to aquire crops, funds, and other things.It also has great modding support, adding even more vehicles and mechanics into the game. Having multiplayer is also a nice touch.With the vanilla game, however, it has its limitations. Aside from 'make money', there are no goals and no directions. There are missions, but those could be considered 'side jobs', eg mow the lawn or forklift this box over there. This offers a great amount of freedom into the game, but it can also be overwhelming for new players.Overall, this is a great farming simulator, but it falls short for anyone expecting it to be more than just a farming simulator."

I actually searched for a reason, and it occurred to me that every kid had a farm set growing up, and this is basically that on steroids. The game presents a good sized world that you can immerse yourself in pretty quickly.The gameplay is very well done, with integrated XBox 360 controller support that requires minimal tinkering. The tutorials are informative while remaining short enough to get you into gameplay quickly. The main thing I like about the gameplay, though, is unlike most simulators, the game's finance system gives me tangible goals that keep me playing. When I got out of the tutorial and started on my very first field, I was having a ton of fun with the different implements (again, this game is really just a toybox of large machines). But when I threshed, cultivated, and planted a new field, I was wondering what to do. Do I just sit there and literally watch the field grow? Thankfully, the game includes a mission system that keeps you busy between plantings, so you always have something to do.The other thing that really strikes me is the insane level of detail the game has. Animals in the game are rendered well, have fluid movement, and add a nice sense of atmosphere while being useful to core gameplay. The cars driving on the roads are surprisngly varied and have a level of detail they really didn't need for this kind of game, but it shows some level of commitment on the part of the devs. The people walking down the streets also are way more detailed than you'd expect from a simulator game that's mainly focused on the technical aspects of farming.This is a game I'd definitely recommend to others to check out, even if you're not a hardcore simulator enthusiast. It's very accessible and surpisingly fun to play."

Purchased 2013 for myself and a friend.  Since then we haven't really taken much time off.  Short of my son really loving the tractors it really is an engaging simulation.  As long as you don't modify your career files to give yourself money and actually earn it, the challange to get the ""awesome"" machines is what makes it so fun.Then there is the modding.  This has to be one of the most modded games i've seen for a simulator.  There are a tonne of awesome mods, some bad but overall an excellent modding community.Multiplayer:Oh and before i forget, i used to play this single player all the time on FS2011.  Since i bought 2013 for me and a friend, I refuse to play single player anymore.  Just not as fun or enoyable.  I absolutely love the multiplayer aspect of this game.The bad...It's poorly optimized.  Even if you have the best machine, you''ll feel a framerate drop at times.  Add mods to the mix and framerate on a medium budget machine becomes impossible at decent graphic settings.I'd like to see the game engine heavily optimized.  The overall game is the best simulator of it's kind.  Don't fall for the others claiming to be farming simulators.  Giants is known for developing half decent sims.

But one of the best ways to progress is to do plenty of missions. It will build your $$$ fast and you can set the mission frequency or turn it off when you've had enough. I got to where I would turn down missions and just acept the ones that were best suited for my game play. I also recommend the ""Real Time"" Setting until you're ready to wait for the harvest and then set it on 120X until your crops are ready the save (which you want to remember to do often) and reset back to ""real time"".  I got so tired of using the front loader I eventually sold all of my sheep and invested the money in larger equipment to sow & harvest much faster. The real time setting makes it easier to borrow money, to make money, and then pay it back before the day is over avoid the interest. Use of the time element helps tremendously.

(it strongly relies on player made content which you can download elsewhere).As it can be a time consuming game with crops taking a rather long time to grow, graphically it was realistic. And you had a great choice of machines to use once you unlocked them.Playing in online mode was good, cause you could join other farmers games or they could join you to help you on your farm.This game is very repetitive so if your not into just buying this game and then completing the ingame achievements and just farming in general, I wouldnt recommend this game. A good game to play if you just want to kill time.The biggest let down of this game you do not get to herd cattle, sheer sheep or even milk the cows, so from an animal farming point of view this game is unrealistic. When you buy an animal it merely appears in a field and when its ready to havest eg. wool from sheep, appears as a small wool bale next to the field.Would I recommend this game, I say yes from the point of view that its the most realistic farming game at the moment on the market. However if another farming game came with an animal farming feature which was more accurate, plus all this farming game features, I would say buy that game instead.Don't buy this game if you dont like repetitive farming games."

Don't get me wrong, I'm sure if you get together with a bunch of your friends (like the youtubers I watched did) you could have a fantastic time. Singleplayer is a different matter, it's tedious and boring. You plant, you harvest, you plant, you harvest, while occassionally getting new vehicles to do some more minor tasks. At least with ETS2 there is the fun of potentially doing something new on your drive, but with this it's the same thing repeated. Graphics aren't really that pleasing, but you can give the game a small break since it's a few years old.tl;dr Repetitive, lose interest quickly."

Other than use it to kill time and drive around classic DLC tractors, I find my patience wearing thin as I try to explore the different things you can do. The physics in the game make Fallout seem normal. Unless you have the patience required to watch paint dry, good luck trying to collect wool from the sheep pen and deliver it. The forklifts always seem to throw things around when you try to go over 3 MPH. I'd suggest finding a DLC fork with a locking script. The scenery is nice and the activites are fun in the beggining, but tend to grow old fast as you're stuck waiting to get enough cash to buy the big, fun equipment. I ended up having to get a money cheat just so I could keep myself interested. Overall, I'd give this game a 4 out of 10. If it wasn't for the bad physics, I'd probably rate it higher. But until my tractor stops launching itself into the sky every time I take a corner too sharp with a trailer, I'm going to find something else to play."

I love to do alot farming however it's just not possible in real life within my area cause my area is so poor that we only have very few farming equipment and is old as our ancesters so for that reason I play farming simulator.Pros:-The engine only loads up so much of the surrounding area as a radius as much as it will allow so that the performance won't bogg down so much if it were to be unlimited.-Allows you to add custom made mods and a very large amount of them, as many as you want.-The missions can help bring you up from debts however it is much too easy to gain a few thousand dollars in just one mowing job or transport goods using a frontloader from some place to another.-Very large amount of farming equipment from the base game plus with the free DLC in the titanium edition.-Love how you're able to reset you're equipment or vehicles back to the farm in case it gets stuck somewhere and can't get it back.-One map from the base game gives you small fields while the other map gives you large sized fields.-The PDA system is a huge help and the layout is just right.-The controls on witch keys do what is also a helpping hand.Cons:-The base of the game only gives two maps? Thank goodness the game allows mods or there would only be two boring maps.-The missions make getting out of debt too easy. You can make an easy million dollars just by doing the missions and have the setting set to ask every 2 minutes.-The game is one giant chunk of mods. Without mods, the game is extremely lame and not fun.-Is transporting goods and mowing yards the only two missions? There isn't even very many transporting goods or mowing jobs.-Cars never should have been added, there more a hassle than fun to look at.-The base only offers a total of 6 fruits. Again, thank goodness there's mods.-Base only gives 3 different animals. Once again, thank goodness for the modding.-Can't test anything out before buying so if you want to check somethin out you purchase then check it out and do a reload of the game.-Not every tool (like the pull behind amazone sprayer) will attach to any of the newer tractor's but will with the older ones.-Greenhouses require manure AND water.. Plants will grow just fine with manure alone. Why not ask for liquid manure instead, it's the same thing.As you can see I used ""mods"" quite often. The game is total s*** without them so that's why I said it's one giant chunk of mods. Great simulator and worth the on sale price but the DLC's made by the dev's aren't worth a buck. I would get all the custom made mods rather than to spend $30 on DLC's that will only give me a few new vehicles and tools each.2/19/15:FS 15 was released and I already checked it out nice and good but I do not like it very much as it's been out now for 4 months and all the bugs should had been worked out, really great mods should have been made by now but sadly some bugs from 13 has went onto 15 even with the 1.2 update released and some of the mods for 15 will crash the game or just not very fun (unrealistic, ridiculous, same thing...).I have jumped back to FS 13 for a while and I still absolutely love it.

It also has some unrealistic aspects of it. Like, the crazy bikes mod, when u just tap something and you're in space. So many aspects that are amazing, and not graphically intensive at all.What I think should be improved with the game:• You should be able to change your Field of View, because there are some people out there who get sick because of it (me included)• VSync Toggle and Max Framerate selection• Nothing else. The game just needs these 3 things, and it is complete.Do I recommend this game? Depends on what you like, but it will have to be a big YES!!!"

I took a shot on a similar deal with Farming Simulator 2013 and what was really surprising this time about the game was that as your farm grew and you gained more fields, it became more like a real time strategy game where you worked to make your farm as efficient as possible while ensuring that your crops were harvested, manure collected and delivered, sheep shorn, chicken eggs rounded up, hoppers filled, etc.  It became even more challenging when you raised the bar on yourself by increasing the time scale.Pros were that farming is relaxing and you get to drive big machines.  Strategy play gets difficult as you expand your farming operation which leads to more challenging game play.  It's a sandbox, so you can do whatever you want and you have to be careful since you can loose a load of pallets off your trailer if you try to shortcut across some rocky areas.  Likewise, I found myself trying to use two separate tractors to free my riding lawn mower from being high centered on some poor kid's exercise trampoline he had the nerve to leave outside in his yard.Some cons for me were the lack of an integrated music player like in Euro2.  Instead I found myself singing the chorus to Craig Morgan's ""International Harvester"" song over and over again as I putted down the road of middle America on my Amazone mower at a whopping 6mph!   The other con was the inability to customize paint jobs or logos on the equipment as well as the lack of proper signage for the drop off points around town.  Took me forever to figure out that the flour mill wasn't the train station even though there was a trainthere...why?No frickin' sign stating FLOUR MILL.Overall, for $6, you can have some fun being a farmer believe it or not."

At that point, it became less about planting and harvesting crops, and more about managing the logistics of servicing your hired workers (keep the combines going with regular visits from the tipper, make sure nobody drives up a tree, move this equipment to that field over there).The first few hours of play, figuring how to get things set up and going, was well worth it, though.In future editions, I'd like to see more automation options (truck drivers that can empty the combine hoppers and deliver crops for sale, workers that can drive the fertilizer truck and hay balers, etc.), so that I can manage a large farm while staying sane."

However, if you like to take your time, be maticulous and plan the best solution to gain money the quickest, then I'd recommend you to try this one out.  I'll admit that it can be a little daunting at the start because there isn't much in the way of on-the-fly tutorials while playing, but once you figure out what you need to be doing, the satisfaction is much greater.  Pro-tip: Sell all the crops in your silos that you start the game with and maybe take a loan or two to buy mower attachments.  Buy the front/rear combo attachments that fold/unfold because they allow you the greatest cutting width and put them on one of your starting tractors.  Quick way to get a lot of money from the side missions.  I received almost $30k just from one mission which nearly paid me back for the mowers.  This is a great game!"

(can't switch options in game, so you need to go main menu, doesn't help when u need to change stuff immidiately)-very much bugs and glitches-grapichs are not so good as you might expect (mainly the shadows/and lightining issues)-no actual rear view mirrors-in world placeables, placing is another big minus (you can only place em to stupid points and camera angle is pain.)-AI is actually very stupid and annoying at times.-can't switch between the gps and other modes at pda/phone unless scrolling em all trough.-hit/touch points are placed oddly at some places.-Finding good servers is pretty difficult.-not worth of 24,99€ (wait it come on sale)Sentence: Good game for those who want to farm, drive around maps or just ""derp"" around or use lots of mods in their games and make it fun that way, but i is repeating game, of course it's based around farming (and it has forest mod) so what can you expect, also that can be fun with friends but after awhile that gets boring aswell."

So, it's a fun game, although I don't really consider it a game.  It's a simulator....like any other sim, except with this one, you get to be farmer John.  This sim is a great learning tool.  I play with my kids.  I teach them the value and importance of saving and working.  I start each with 100,000 dollars.  I told them thats all the money they get, and teach them about saving...in this case for needed equipment.   It's actually perfect for this kind of thing.From a personal standpoint, I'd like to see a few changes.  Since there is now an American farm, it'd be nice to see the weather in degrees, instead of celsius.  I know most probably use Centigrade, however, it'd at least be nice to be able to toggle from one or the other.  Also, since you don't have the means at the start, it'd be nice to be able to buy hay and straw for feeding purposes.  You can buy animals and other placeable buildings, so doing this would enhance the simulation.   Additionally, for the American farm, putting the fields in acres instead of hectares would be a nice change as well.   Lastly, it'd be nice to see the seasons change for a more realistic planting experience.  Example, corn in spring/summer, wheat in winter.  Perhaps color coding the calendar with fall/winter/summer would be a good way to accomplish this.If you want a ""game"" that you can kill hours on, and have some moderate fun....this is it.  Keep in mind...it's a sim....about farming.  Those who work, or have worked on a farm understand....there is ALOT of monotony.  Nothing happens fast on a farm...except spending money....and lots of it."

The time and dexterity it takes just to plow a field are brutal, and that was the first tutorial. I personally enjoy slow-paced games, but after trying this I can see that I apparently prefer more of a management style of game than an all-out simulator. I don't want to spend 20 minutes clumsily plowing a field and driving a tractor that makes grocery carts and mop bucket trolleys seem wieldy. The only person I could see enjoying this game is someone who has literally nothing to do and the patience of the most patient saint. I usually like games that other people call ""boring"", but not this time. Didn't get past the punishing, painful tutorial. ""Tedious agony"" pretty much sums it up."

There is a lot to do in the game.. you start with the basics (harvester, couple of tractors, a few implements etc) and you then decide what you want to do.....you can start laying down seeds in your small field or do some missions... can even buy cattle, sheep or chickens.... The map for the game is very big and does take time from one end to the other... and missions can be tedious because of this.. There are plenty of fields to buy and oportunities to buy them cheaper (Auction)..... The Sim has a hell of a lot to buy in the shops... including premium items...plus you start with loads of items in the game to purchase with game money anyways...  No shortage of bits.... Takes a while to earn a good bit of money.....as for missions i find them boring... they were put in as an afterthought for a way of increasing funds fast... but all you can do is either take pallet from A to B .....or....... cut grass at X with Tractor mower.... seriously... could they not have added in ploughing.....seeding certain fields... race your tractors from A - B in time limit etc... anyway thats one of the few downsides to the game.... I still think its well worth a purchase whether you are new to the genre or familiar with the farming grind... plenty to enjoy...PROS -Big Open map with plenty of places to goLOADS of equipment to purchaseGreat weather effectsPlenty of crops to harvestCONS -Tedious missionsVehicles look great but surroundings have poor textures for 2012the Hired worker (AI) could have been much betterOverall great game 7/10"

Back to what I said earlier, I guess the reason for them not telling you all you need to know is because, they dont want to reveal everything. Which is fine, but if they want to know, tell them how.

Definitely worth a try. If you don't like it, and you have less than two hours on it and less than 14 days of ownership, you can refund and get all your money back. Just try it and you will be hook.I have 1,051.4 hours at my time of writing this, so I can say it is fun.Btw, the default vehicles and such are crap, mods definitely make it better. Especially the detailed ones like the ford forces, small farming pack, International Harvester 86 series pack, auto steer, hud hider, manual ignition, quick camera, and 956 moco pack.P.S  Notice how I write with perfect precision? Google docs rock!"

Maybe I have to play with friends to get into it, or maybe i just don't get it. You know what would help? Music, like truckers have music farmers should have music too LOL! but no seriously, I'm gonna keep working on it. Is it addicting? No. Is it fun?

It doesnt hold my interest.  The workers you hire miss spots and quit whenever they want. (probably a glitch) If you get a vehicle stuck there is no way to Get it out (in game) except ramming it with another vehicle.  Now im not saying it doesnt have perks but its the little things that they could have put in the game that make it TERRIBLE. Honestly, I think this Simulator should be listed as a beta that way they can excuse it from everything it lacks. I paid 4 Dollars USD for it and I think I wasted my money. Buy 2015, I heard it is better."

This game was more than I expected. The graphics are great, and so is the performance of the game and how it plays very well on most mid range lap tops. I run a Toshiba C75D-A7370 with an AMD A6 Quad-Core 5200, 8GB ram with a 750GB hard drive, and a Radeon HD 8400. I have 0 performance issues or graphic issues. Multiplayer is relatively great. Good game, I would recommend to any PATIENT person who is willing to wait for things."
