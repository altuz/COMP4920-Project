I have enjoyed my time with it and would definitly reccomend it, the only complaint I would have is that after a while of playing it can feel kind of grindy with not much else to focus your efforts on.  Brought me into the platforming genre and I still love it"
,Not Recommended,220460,9492465,"Posted: 15 March, 2014",all,Ksempac,"Cargo Commander is a sort of mini ""roguelike-like"" in space. The levels (""sectors"") are randomly generated, and it's up to you to rush into theses containers to get as much loot as possible before your inevitable demise.On the one hand, the game will immediatly grab you. It's fast, it's fun to get loot, and there is a fair bits of tactics to get the most out of each container, without taking too much risk.The game also has lot of dark humor. You had to provide for your family so you decided to take what is probably the worst job of the Universe. Your company doesn't care at all about its workers and their safety, they only care about their profit, and will pay as low as they can, while charging as much as they can for basic equipment. To not worry your wife about all this, you lied to her and she now write you thinking you're just a basic warehouse worker giving a very surreal feeling to her messages.On the other hand, ""finishing"" the game, ie getting all the different type of loot feel more like a chore than anything. Each sector has only 5 or 6 different types of loot, and you have almost no way of knowing what you will get (you get some ""scanners"" that help you, but they are limited). So you go through a level, hoping to get the loot you're looking for, and if you're lucky, you will get maybe one new type of loot. But they are more than 80 to get ! That's a lot of sectors to explore, and the game doesn't have enough variety to make that grind really fun.It tooks me 11H to get 2/3 of the items, but it felt twice as long and i stopped. Then a year later it took me another 13h to get the final third of the loot. That was pure grind, very repetititve and not fun. It's only my usual urge to complete games that made me finish that one.Given the price of the game, it might still be worth it. It's fun for a while, you don't feel cheated. However, it's sad that it doesn't have lasting appeal. There are definitely better games out there."

,Not Recommended,220460,25280817,"Posted: 31 August, 2016",all,TheMonkofDestiny,"Cargo Commander is a mix of missed opportunity, above average platforming and quirky style. It's easy to be charmed by it in the early going but it quickly becomes more of a chore than it needs to be.The core gameplay is that of a 2D platformer with basic shooting elements. You're given objectives to complete (basic tasks, typically involving the collection of randomized loot throughout the equally randomized cargo containers you'll be exploring across level sets known as ""sectors""). The ultimate goal is to eventually travel back to your family, who become increasingly worried and frustrated with your absence as days progress within the game - made known to the player through an in-game email system and parcel delivery service.In the early hours of the game this will do a sufficient job at keeping you occupied. Completing collections of loot and earning permanent upgrades (or unlocking a new mode of play) will easily obscure the fact that you're basically doing the same thing over and over again, just in a different set of containers... at least for a while.Of course, the game does its best to distract you from the obvious by throwing hazards in your way. These consist of enemies (none of which are particularly interesting, most of them just varying in size from small to indestructibly large) often spawned from crystals inside some of the containers to environmental hazards such as combustible cubes that will blow apart anything in their surrounding area once detonated.Between all that and the ability to upgrade your existing equipment (provided you can afford it), the game gives you the illusion of variety. Once you've played long enough to see past that illusion, you may find boredom setting in rather quickly. This becomes especially true when you're hunting for specific loot items or while you're attempting to gather enough loot to sell in order to afford the next parcel delivery.But, for its simple (and repetitive) premise Cargo Commander has some interesting elements on display. One example would be the inclusion of a drill not solely as a weapon but a tool used for carving your own path throughout the containers. Another, though far less useful overall, is the ability to break the sense of loneliness and ennui through extensive use of profanity.The game's art style, while not particularly visually arresting, is a pleasant hybrid of cel shaded 3D that unfortunately doesn't get the full attention it deserves due to the need of using the zoom function to expand the view when in containers. The game also features an in-game stereo system that, once the feature is unlocked, allows for the playback of custom audio. Considering that the game only has a grand total of two audio tracks available by default (relying less on the presence of musical score and more on sound design), this becomes something you'll find hard to live without should you want to see the game through to its conclusion.Worth mentioning, though not greatly explored to its fullest extent, is the multiplayer aspect of the game (or as close to what can be considered multiplayer). Outside of local competitive play, the online aspect is one that consists of attempting to best the top score for a given sector. While attempting to do so, you may find the corpses of other players within containers of that sector serving as a possible warning to how dangerous a given container may be. You're also given the opportunity to find and write postcards from within the game. This acts as a very limited means of player to player interaction but it's enough to offer a break from the demanding grind of loot collection.Overall, Cargo Commander could've seen benefit from shortening the list of loot available to collect (though this would come at the cost of shortening the total playtime of the game, it would reduce the fatigue brought on by how repetitive it tends to be). The small amount of storytelling included in the game, subtle as it is, is something that definitely should've been expanded upon as well.Walking away from the game, especially having finished it after the accumulation of so many hours, I found a tremendous sense of relief that I didn't have to go back to it again. In many ways, I suppose I had become the Cargo Commander - after months spent agonizingly cataloging space junk, I could finally go home."

The visuals and sound only serve to enhance this feeling.  Realists may use the ""silent space"" option, but the ability to use your own music aboard the ship is outstanding.  The controls are excellent, and they should be, for a relatively simple platform game.Unfortunately, the gameplay matches too well the drudgery of space salvaging.  Sectors may be randomly generated but offer little challenge.  With over eighty cargo types and only six types per sector, the game is an exercise in patience rather than skill.  Completionists will find themselves weary-eyed searching for ultra rare cargos.Salvage the fun by playing in short sittings.6/10"
,Not Recommended,220460,8861458,"Posted: 26 January, 2014",all,agentmith,"I was led to believe that this was a roguelike game by the community and I purchased it with that level of expectation, however I think the definition of ""roguelike"" has taken some creative liberties over the past few years to encompass games that simply have a random element to them. This game isn't even random, as the maps are based off of words and are infinitely replayable (as far as I can tell).I've been playing roguelikes for a long time, and this isn't anywhere near what I consider in the genre. You've got classic genre-defining games such as Nethack, Moria, or Angband, and modern representations of roguelikes such as Tales of Maj'eyal, Dungeons of Dredmor and Sword of the Stars: The Pit. I see no shared qualities between Cargo Commander and any of those. No roleplaying aspects, character generation, permadeath, or any of the other qualities you would hope to find in a roguelike.Cargo Commander is a platform puzzle game, which I don't care for at all. So, I'm giving a negative review as a warning to others that may have had similar expectations. If you enjoy platformers or puzzle games, I'm sure this is great, but I do not enjoy them. I really tried to like it, but found it pointless, arbitrarily challenging, and ultimately unfun. The ""loot"" you find may as well be nameless widgets, as collecting items are simply for the purpose of checking them off of a list for completion's sake. That's really the bulk of the game. Unlock a new place, try to find an item you haven't found on your list prior, repeat until you're done and unlock the next place. It's tiresome.I would recommend you look elsewhere if you're looking for a roguelike. If you're looking for a platform puzzle game, check it out. You'll probably like it."

You have to deliver cargo, which you collect in the levels called sectors, for your company. You are able to upgrade your character with a better suite, a better drill and so on. To upgrade your stuff you need to collect caps. Caps are hidden in cargo or dropped by enemies. There are three enemy types: small, intermediate, big. You can find better weapons in the sectors at certain points to kill the bigger enemies much faster. You start with a nail gun and you can carry two weapons. Every weapon can be upgraded with things like an autofire option or faster reloading. At the start of the game you have three terminals (nagivator, console, magnet) at your spaceship which looks like a cargo crate. With the navigation console you can travel to other sectors. You can travel to popular sectors, unpopular sectors, random sectors or sectors which you are naming. Every progress of every player will be traced and save for the leaderboards.You can find in each sector a new sector pass to unlock new sectors and each sector has it's own type of cargo. Every new type of cargo found will level your rank at you company. At each new rank your company will deliver you a permanent bonus like a cup of coffee (faster run), a terminal to repair your ship, ammunition supply, a better drill, etc. If you die and you have collected the sector pass it won't be lost, but all your upgrades will be lost. Yes - death, travel to another sector or going to sleep will reset your upgrades - they are all temporary except the upgrades from your company. Story ... is available but only as text by reading e-Mails at the console. You have a wife and a kid who will send you parcels or drawings from time to time. The e-Mails from the company have some kind of humor, so it's not only text to skip - it makes you smiling, if you died the tenth time and reading an e-Mail from your company, that they are proud of their new all-time-dying-employee. ^^Something missed? Ah yes; it's created like a tower-defense. You start your spaceship magnet to pull up a new wave of cargo. The cargo containers will crash into your spaceship and then you are able to enter these containers. The ship's side and all the platforms can be bored with your drill (except one type of platform) to make your way through, because your way will be blocked by walls. Every container has it's own gravity field, in some of them you can toggle the gravity via a terminal. You can exit always into the space to move directly back to your ship or to other containers. You will move faster in space by using the recoil of your weapon. You have to hurry within each wave, because after all containers have been arrived you have only a short period of time left until a warp hole is opening and one after another container will be released/destroyed.Pros:+ nice game concept (haven't played anything like this before and I don't really like space games ^^)+ you will get a feeling of lostness (not because of a confusing level but rather of the space around you)+ humoristic mails+ controls working fine+ nice gravity+ graphics are okay (how to make space and metal looking awesome?! ^^)+ replayability (to collect new types of cargo to level up)(+ steam achievements)Cons:- not really varied (three enemy types, same environment, same procedure)- the handling of the magbomb weapon is bad (really bad)- story is weak- no cutscenes(- no demo available)Recommended, even if it'snot on sale, because it's a nice concept which sometimes feels repetitive, but it's great fun to upgrade by having a lost-in-space feeling.7.5/10"

76561198041195703,Recommended,220460,26883282,"Posted: 23 November, 2016",all,Terotrous,"This is just a really solid game in general.  At its core, Cargo Commander is a roguelike platformer of sorts, you spend your time exploring cargo crates for loot items and bringing them back to base while also trying not to get killed by enemies, but it has a lot of smart mechanics that keep the experience interesting.For starters, each crate will only be available for a limited time before it gets sucked into space, and if you're still on it you'll have to fight your way back to base before you suffocate, which both creates a nice element of risk vs reward and also keeps the game moving at a good clip.  The game's pacing is very good in general, you can get into a stage quickly and zip through the easy early waves (you can end a wave early if you've finished exploring it or don't want to risk getting killed) to get to the challenging content in record time.  This is a great timekiller game in general because you can get a lot done in a short amount of time.It's also an example of randomized content done well.  The sectors are all generated randomly using words as a seed, but even after doing about a hundred of them it didn't feel repetitive, partially because the game moves so quickly.  You might encounter a crate design you've seen before, but the focus is more on the larger goal of grabbing as much stuff as you can and getting back to base before time runs out, and you never know what to expect as each new wave hits.  I also like that the sectors can actually be ""won"" (both by surviving long enough to get the sector pass and the more difficult, optional task of surviving to the final wave), unlike most randomized games where you just play until you die, it makes the game feel a bit more rewarding.There's even a little bit of story in here.  It's very subtle and doesn't interrupt the game experience, but it's kind of touching nonetheless and it helps keep you going until you reach the end."

,Recommended,220460,15613776,"Posted: 29 April, 2015",all,savaze,"Conditional recommendation, see below for why.Cargo Commander is a simple game where you play as a character who's trying to recover space junk. You are armed with a mechanical arm that has a drill, nailgun, and other things can be installed into it. It can also be used to flail away at enemies or containers.  The idea is that you live in a recovery module that can become a giant magnet to attract other modules. Those modules contain spare parts and other goodies that you collect. To enter those other modules requires a quick jump through airless space. These modules are attracted in random numbers and you have a limited timeframe to search them before a wormhole destroys all the freefloating modules. These modules can also contain aliens that will whittle away your health and distract you. You can also use up your limited ammo attacking them. You need to balance your time by figuring out the quickest way to collect things before you find yourself flailing in space while the modules you were in become destroyed. All in all the gameplay is quick, light, and fun.My only gripe is that this game seems like it would be a good fit for kids, but if you tap a key/button (it has full controller support) too many times or hit a certain key, your character suddenly starts spouting profanities (which are also flashed around your character). While it could be funny if that's your slant, it otherwise feels out of place, and a cry to try to get a certain demographic to play the game. I think the gameplay could stand on it's own without the strange humor, but I think it could potentially limit younger audiences, and polite society, from playing it. I give this game a conditional recommendation based on that premise."

It's like Spelunky because all of the ""sectors"" are generated based on their name (I'm not using the word random because every time you play in the same sector it's going to be exactly the same. This is intentional and important though, because it has leaderboards) so you could make a sector for just yourself or if you told your friends what it was called you could have a private match, which is pretty neat. You call in waves of crates, which will all pile up around your home crate then you have a variable amount of time to delve into them, you could find cargo, caps, enemies, a deathtrap of a crate, the list goes on. When time expires, though, a wormhole appears and you have just thirty seconds to get the hell back before everything goes♥♥♥♥♥♥up and all the crates fall away (The disintergration is fully realised with its physics engine making all the pieces collapse or explode out) Then you upgrade yourself with the caps and store the cargo until you get bored or die, the first of which is surprisingly difficult, the latter of which is surprisingly easy.The other mode is Journey, where crates just fly at each other at random intervals and directions and if they touch each other they stop for about 3 minutes until they disintergrate. It sounds simple but it's a bit scary. I didn't know that the enemies could propel themselves back into crates by shooting backwards, let's say. That's another thing, the vacuum actually does suck (in the objective, not subjective way) and making a hole is a good way to clear out a room."

You play as a ""cargo commander"", who lives in a floating home in the depths of space. You pull cargo containers up to your base via gravity generator, and it is your job to search these containers to find what else, cargo. The rarer the cargo is, the more unique items you add to your database. The more cargo, the higher your score in the sector you reside. You really feel the lonliness of space while isolated alone with no communication, but you still feel compelled to adventure and discover more of the void. It can have some glitches at times, such as being stuck between two containers and forcing you to die and end the mission as well as random texture issues, but the overall game functions pretty well. Cargo Commander is a fun, pick-up-and-play game that is extremely easy to play and learn."

Each day starts over, giving you another opportunity for high scores. Potentially infinite sectors to explore; you can create your own. Sweet sector navigator: search by most and least popular, find a random one, or search for one in particular.Get it. Reminds me of a Kongregate game called ""Fisher-Diver"".

(Yeah yeah, so sue me!)  Anyway, being bored here is another huge manefesto of misspellings and bad jokes that I call a review.Is the game fun?  Well if you enjoy battling with undead co-workers (who don't look like zombies); if you lust after scouring for neon accented crates filled with baubles and trinkets; if you revel in the cold vaccumesqe of space then yes, you will have fun with this game.You start equiped with a fist-gun ala Barret, and pressing the ""F"" key shows you're just as vulgar.  Regardless, our little chubby fister (Also a good title, if they want to use it.) has good reason.  His company has thrown him into the void, on a never ending quest to save up for his girlfriend! (Actually his wife, and artwork imparied child)  With country music pounded into his skull, on a never ending loop, he must use his cubed ship to ensare debris.  The debris is basically large cargo crates, but since you're also on the lookout for small crates I figured debris would be better.  (The verbose explanation defeated my plans...)Anyway, you use a magnet to get the ""debris"" to attach to your home.  After a short wait ""boom"" the thing arrives, and the level begins.  (That's right, this has roguelike elements to it! Woo!)  Navigating the maze that is the level, you pick up weapon upgrades (which do not stay with you at the end of the day, that makes sence if you know what it means.)  There are spawners spawning spawns that must be pwned (spwned?)  As well as the neon crates that you want to grab (these increase your level score, which is what is shared to all players on leaderboards.)After a random amount of time, and debris smashing into itself enlarging the level, a wormhole will open.  This destroys each crate, probably starting with the one you're in...(last to hit debris, to first to hit your house debris)  If you're blown into space, there is no worry.  You have a small supply of air that should last till you get back into the debris, or your home.  Anti-gravity maneuvers are a bit more skill driven though!Once you're tired of gathering boxes, or you get the ""end level item"" you begin the End of the Day!  This calculates your score, and plasters it on the leaderboards.  (Or in my case, the trailerboards.  Boy did I stink!)  All in all this was a lot of fun, It's not my bag of chips, but like I said I just wanted the cards.7/10 (I can still respect a good game, even if it's not for me.)"

Addictive and infinitely replayable.The premiseIn this game you endure waves of containers. They crash into your home container one by one, and you must float through space and drill your way inside. Each container has its own center of gravity, which is cool. In the containers you'll find monsters, guns and varied loot. Loot comes in all shapes and sizes, from sweaters to old donuts to alien sex toys - some are rarer than others. You must collect enough loot to advance the story.SectorsThere's a pretty cool system called sectors. Basically, a sector is a series of containers generated based on a name. Each sector has a Sector Pass that lets you unlock a new one, either by typing in a name or selecting one from a list of the most popular names. There's no RNG in generating a sector, it's all based on the name so each sector will be the same for everyone. Different sectors also have different loot so exploring new sectors is very rewarding. I like it.Postcards and corpsesThere is an online aspect of this game, but it's not as direct as you might think. You find postcards in containers-- sometimes blank ones you can write and send into the vast reaches of space to be discovered by some other player, mostly written ones another player wrote at some point in space and time. You'll also find the corpses of other players that died in that very container. In fact, I've come across my own corpse plenty of times. Postcards and corpses really contribute to the feeling of loneliness.Press F to release stressIf you press F your guy will yell ""♥♥♥♥ YOU!"" which bumps this game up to a 11/10.I like this game and I want you to purchase it."

In truth, you're fighting for your life to salvage cargo from massive, crumbling containers in deep space, infested with the mutant remains of past salvage workers, littered with your predecessor's dead bodies, in the limited time before your home-ship's electromagnet triggers a wormhole to open and consume the cubes you've summoned.The gameplay is a gravity-bending high-speed combat and exploration platformer with a rich upgrade system, with sectors generated by phrases you input, allowing you to visit sectors other commanders have before you (beat my high score on 'deathstar') to compete, or perhaps just to feel a little less lonely in the cold depths of space. Upgrades are short-lived, lasting long enough to finish the working day, and range from grippier boots to emergency oxygen tanks, from laser sighted revolvers to plasma-chambered shotguns, and as you earn promotions for your sterling salvage work your home ship will receive significant improvements as well.The game is challenging, but you control the challenge - you decide whether to enter a particularly infested cube, you decide when to end the work day, and at the end, if you are killed in action or suffocate in open space, you'll be retrieved by medical robots and repaired, to wake up groggy for a new day.Don't forget to check your emails before you engage the electromagnet, and remember to grab a warm cup of coffee before you begin the working day...

You just unlock random levels which are really not all that differentYou're on a short timeframe because a level ""collapses"" after a while. And it's really not that long, so you can't take your time to explore, enjoy the scenery and have fun because in no-time it all breaks downYou start from scratch every time you begin a new level, so there's no real progression to be saidYou can get certain score at levels, but the max is like 9999 and the top10 on the level's leaderboard is filled with players that got that. They're probably cheaters, too...There's a button for your guy to randomly start cursing. And it's not just one soundfile, they actually put some effort in it too. I wish the devs had spent their resources on making the game decent instead.Don't pick this game up.

It's pretty simple, but there are a lot of unique elements that keep it fresh and the replayability high. You're a guy alone on a ship in space. You travel to various sectors (which exist online - I'll get to that in a moment) and use a high-powered magnet to crash giant containers into your ship, which you then explore in a 2D platformer style setting for cargo. There are monsters to fight on these containers and a variety of weapons to find. One of the really neat things about the gameplay is that other plays search these same containers when they play in the same sector you are currently in. If they die in one of the crates, you find (and loot!) their corpses. It's not a complicated game, but it has simple mechanics and goals that keep it enjoyable."

I never felt in true control. It is perfectly responsive but that is not the issue. Jumping around is loose and inaccurate. Landing where you want is sometimes hit and miss. Attacking is a joke: your melee attack's hit detection is horrible. Sometimes I hit enemies, sometimes I sit there and try to while they hit me about four times but I never hit them. The ranged weapon isn't much better. It takes a ton of shots to kill bigger enemies and ammo is scarce. Floating around and drilling and navigating to other containers feels like a chore rather than fun. Keyboard controls are a nightmare, so I tried with my 360 controller. Jumping controls were better but aiming and attacking with both melee and ranged weapons was way worse.I am sure there are plenty of people to show that I am wrong and say that they had no trouble with the controls, I am in the minority I understand that, but it is not even just that. The game is just really odd and generic. If you think the controls are good then good for you. I have beaten some extremely hard games before and I never felt hampered by the controls.

And thanks to being a cartoony art style, even with minimum graphics, it still looks really good. Personally, I find it amazing how you can create your own sectors to challenge your friends or any random person who finds the same sector, along with having a very comedic item system. I mean, even finding the odd postcard now and then really makes me smile, the kind of things people write on them. You can send your own postcards and have another random player recieve it unless you specify a name.

I didn't play all that much, but what I did play was rife with crashes and generally boring gameplay. You play as a space dude floating around the empty cosmos with one goal, collect space junk. By collecting junk, you are able to upgrade your gear to enable you to collect more junk faster and easier. That's it. As far as I can tell the only thing a player can strive for is to get a high score on a map. But that's hard to do when everytime you try to play someone elses map the game crashes. Maybe it's just my PC, but it's not worth my time to try anymore.Pros:- Fun gravity mechanics- Equipment upgrades- Random stages/enemiesCons:- Gets boring fast- Lots of crashesDon't bother with this game.

Not beautiful in regards to graphics but just the atmosphere of this game is amazing. There is one song that play's on the radio in game and it's just so lovely sounding and catchy. From the 3 or so hour's i've played on and offline, this has been the only song i've heard in the entire game. That being said it does'nt feel repitive at all and it's a nice little theme for the game. Now back to the actual game. In cargo commander you're a buff little guy who activates a magnet which pulls in large cargo crates to your small space shuttle.Once they've made impact you have to go inside and get the precious cargo within and retrieve it back to your base without dying. Along the way there are a couple hazards. Such as rock monsters with little hat's who are gonna try and kill you when they see you, but don't worry, you've got a nailgun to fend them off!  Another major thing geting in your way is the fact that you are in space and to travel between cargo containers you must go into space without any protection, so you can die rather quickly if you aren't fast enough. The game eventually add's more containers as you progress into the galaxy, to add a bit more challenge to it.All up this game is wonderful, if you're into fast speedy action games, this isnt for you. But if you're willing to take it slow and grab some cargo on your lonesome then this is the game for you.8.5/10p.s. Here's the wonderful song from the OSThttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMLYvMzaH5Q"

Therefore, Cargo Commander is actually a dungeon crawler. As such, it could be compared to a variety of titles which don't have randomisation since in reality the random nature of Cargo Commander is actually based upon the seed of the galaxy you are visiting. As such, each galaxy can be played multiple times with exactly the same containers appearing.As a game, CC is certainly fun. But only as much as it has that - one more try - aspect absolutely nailed. If you are looking for a challenge it is fair to say you will find that here to some degree and the endless array of potential zones means that you can always find something new. But it would probably be something I'd only suggest you pick up on discount because the novelty of the multi-directional gravity does wear off and there is a clear ceiling for skill which impacts your enjoyment when you reach it. The difficulty curve however is fierce, which can work for or against the chance you will enjoy the game. Depending upon the person.If you have some disposable income and want to try a dunegon crawler which offers something different to the fantasy theme. I would certainly recommend Cargo Commander.

,Not Recommended,220460,16552200,"Posted: 20 June, 2015",all,Azroix,"Cargo Commander has a decent enough concept that could benefit greatly from some narrative construction. The gameplay consists entirely of collecting unknown cargo from various sized containers that you attract with your magnet. The only win condition is to collect all 88 or so pieces of unique cargo. You can only find 5 to 6 pieces of unique cargo per sector and you need to find sector keys to move on to another sector. Sectors are essentially the same void in space pulling in randomly generated containers.Once you play through two or three sectors, you've pretty much experienced Cargo Commander. It's rinse-and-repeat grindfest in its purest form. Without a narrative element pushing you forward to the end, I can't see anyone but ""completionist""-type players really enjoying much out of this game."

Imagine that your job would be to fly around with your ship untill you find a flying cargo and collect the lost items in that container. Got that? Yeah? Because that'S all there is in CARGO COMMANDER. You treverse those containers by runnning jumping and using your tools to get some items.  Those tools are a drill which is used to drill through walls and other objects and you've got a weapon which is used to fight the monsters that inhabit the abandoned containers. The more items you collect in the containers the more points you get. But you only have a certain amount of time to explore a wave of containers because after a few minutes a black hole opens which sucks the containers inside. There are randomly generated sectors which consist of endless waves of containers. On the fith wave or so you can find a sector pass which can be used to unlock a new sector. Becuase of the fact that every sector is randomly generated the game could be played endlessly but for me it got boring rather quickly, What I've played was a hell of fun .

There is also a slower-paced ""Journey mode"" that is unlocked after a while, if you want to spend a more thoughtful and less frantic experience.The main aim of the game is collecting all the different types of cargo, a blue-collar version of Pokemon. You won't have the option of knowing what cargo is in a level, not until midway through the game.

Initially maddeningly addictive, Cargo Commander quickly becomes repetitive and its lack of depth apparent. This could have been remedied with more imagination from the developers and the input of a professional game writer.The idea, the game mechanics and the environment are great. With every activation of the magnet on your drifting home in space, massive crates from interstellar junkyards smash into the wall. You must search these, uncover valuable cargo, find better weapons, destroy enemy critters. After collecting enough cargo a crate will arrive with a sector pass. Only with this can you travel to another region, with the possibility of looting rarer cargo.This is really fun initially, but it is easy to get bogged down on one sector that has a particularly difficult sector pass crate. If you fail to collect the sector pass or die, you have to redo another round of crates until it comes again. This quickly sucks the fun out of playing. With more weapons, more enemies and more direction in the form of a stronger storyline, what is a solid romp in the park could have been a great game."

This is a cute little hidden gem on steam, a nice score attack-type game that has you running through cargo containers in space in an effort to bring back as large a haul as possible to your home ship. It offers a nice risk/reward style of gameplay, as the cargo containers will begin to drift back out into space after a few moments, meaning the further you go for loot the harder it is to get back in time. You can even enter your own seeds to generate levels and share these with friends. A very fun coffee break game well worth the price."

What amazes me most is this entire game was made by two guys, TWO! and for just how much fun ive had im just a little sad that they've (as a company) done nothing (that i can find) other than a mutiplayer game called Bönkers that i can't find a release for.Honestly if your intested in this game either watch a video, (id reccomend nerd 3 as it was the video that led me to buy this like here:https://youtu.be/OBHS3mnkhUsalternatively buy it and try it (i mean refunds are there if your dissapointed).My only gripes with the game are that the ending feels lack luster (although the drawings from your kid are amazing), and that journey mode the boxs take so long to come in and theres no way to speed this up (but i mostly played the main game and the weekly challenge so not the end of the world)."

,Recommended,220460,11247701,"Posted: 15 July, 2014",all,Hired Shoestring,"Short Review:This game is a nifty little Rouge-lite platformer. Worse than spelunky (well duh), better than Rogue Legacy. Has a great atmosphere and plenty of exhilarating spikes of tension. Plus it's funny!Long Review:Cargo Commander. It sounds like the sort of self important handle I might have referred to myself with back when I played the space MMO Eve Online. Ah, those were the days; stick the ship on autopilot, make myself a brew, read the latest Andy McNab novel, deliver the goods, job done. Yet Cargo Commander shares very little in common with such tranquillity… except the space setting, and the brew… and I guess you might be able to replicate that inner peace with an incessant swearing session (just press the F key).Cargo Commander plays out more like a day in the life of that guy from Alien. You know the one: the engineer; he’s very fond of his cap, sick of being screwed over by the company, and is the first to have his brains munched on. But at least now he can rest easy knowing that caps are finally receiving their due appreciation, serving as Cargo Commander’s much sought-after currency.So, the deal: your new space-home is situated twenty light years from all forms of entertainment bar country music, emails from your wife and a coffee-machine (boasting +20% speed, seriously). Suitably bored yet? Then you might as well get to work.This first involves turning on a magnet. Soon enough a massive space container comes crashing into your home. Initially equipped with your drill and nail gun, you voyage out in search of precious cargo.The first haul is always relatively simple. You find your way in, hop on a couple of platforms, drill through a few walls, collect the cargo, return home and deactivate the magnet. That last bit, from here on out it won’t be relevant. The next time you activate that magnet you will be greeted with five or so maze-like containers, more often than not chock-full of slavering mutants. As you can imagine, this makes your job a fair bit more time consuming, not least deadly. In fact it tends to consume just about enough time for you to discover that this space-magnet technology ain’t all that stable; it invariably opens up a wormhole intent on greedily dragging the containers and their cargo back to where they came from.The moment the container you’re in disintegrates  you are faced with two immediate difficulties: 1) a lack of oxygen; this may cause a slight shortness of breath, 2) the cargo you couldn’t reach in time is now floating out into the nothingness of space. See where this is going? For me, this situation results in either an act of defiant heroism or a motionless body forever floating through cold space. Succeed and the breathless dash back home is greeted by the comforts of music, coffee, and seeing your score edge ever higher.Cargo Commander has to be one of the funniest games I’ve ever played. It employs a similar brand of gallows humour to Portal 2 but unlike other attempts (Penumbra: Black Death) the comedy fits the ridiculous♥♥♥♥♥fatal gameplay like a glove. Dare I say it, Serious Brew’s comic concoction seems more natural than even their peers. For instance, after scraping just enough to pay for one of many delivery fees (seemingly subject to hyper-inflation), our hero receives a crude, cutesy picture drawn by his son. N’awwwww,wait what are those faint words on the other side of the paper? “EVICTION NOTICE”. Your family’s grim situation couples tragically (hilariously) with your lowly job collecting cargo, most of which is of equivalent worth as an old boot to a fisherman.Once you’ve survived a few cargo hauls, hopefully scavenging enough caps to spend on a few upgrades, you’re presented with the chance to McNab (crap review in-joke alert) yourself a ‘sector pass’. Or, in other words, your ticket outa this hell-hole. Destination: another hell-hole. Only by snatching these green-glowing boxes can you progress through Cargo Commander’s ‘story’, which essentially revolves around climbing the greasy corporate pole from Deckswab Trainee to Boss by collecting new types of cargo. So it’s fairly annoying when you miss a sector pass, and it is in this context that the game invites you to abuse your F key and bask in the ensuing profanity uttered by your character.Say, however, that you do manage to grab that sector pass, well here’s the interesting bit: Cargo Commander‘s sectors are randomly generated based around a name, so you could either compete for high-scores in the currently popular ‘Moon’ sector or head to ‘Rotherham’ as I did. I’ve heard it’s the new Berlin.Importantly Cargo Commander is the sort of game that rewards clever play in the face of adversity. Running out of ammo and faced with a slew of mutants? Drill through the container hull and try tempting those idiots into deep space by playing the human carrot. Too many obstacles between you and your cargo? Hold your breath, float your way around the outside the container and drill yourself a new, convenient entrance!"
,Recommended,220460,21677643,"Posted: 6 March, 2016",all,Hydroculator,"This was an interesting one.   Not a very deep game, this rogue-like platformer puts you at the helm of your space-house slash cargo collection headquarters.  The game plays out like this: Your ship sits in a space-junkyard of abandoned cargo containers.  You activate a magnet that attract a random container which slams into your ship, temporarily joining the two.Your job is to then explore the newly adjacent container, looting all the valuables you can find.  Enemies along the way will attempt to stop you from taking the contents, but you’re armed with several different weapons to help dispatch your opponents.Also fortunately, ammunition and weapon upgrades are plentiful and easy to find along your journey.The main obstacle to your mission is time; shortly after you begin looting the containers, a wormhole will begin to open in space near your container, ripping it to shreds.  If you happen to be inside the container when it disintegrates, you’ll find yourself floating along, gasping for air.  You then have a very limited time to get into another container and find breathable air, or make it all the way back to your ship.If you don’t make it home in time, you’ll find yourself a permanent resident of the space-junkyard, drifting along with the cargo containers forever.  Bummer.Assuming you do make it back to your ship while you’re still breathing, your onboard computer will evaluate your loot and tell you if anything you found is of any value.  Accumulate enough loot, and you’ll begin to earn levels and gain the ability to permanently upgrade your gear, armor, and weapons.What I liked: The premise of the game is cute.  It’s a fun game.  The graphics are playful, the sound effects were well done, and the controls were well configurable.What I didn’t like: I got really tired of dying.  I know that dying is a regular part of a game like this, but I always felt like my deaths were slightly unfair.  Maybe I just need more practice.This game was heavily discounted when I picked it up; I think that selling Steam Cards paid for this one.  So if you see it on sale, and looking for a little game without a lot of thinking involved, you could do worse.Thanks for reading."

The levels are proceedurally generated, which is cool, except that there is no consistency to the gameplay. Some levels have tons of amunition and no monsters while others have tons of monsters and no amunition. You lose all of your upgrades and equipment when you change levels so there is no real sort of progression and no way to prepare for more difficult levels, even though it is represented in a sort of career-like format. It also has problems with freezing and crashing, and the menus load very slowly, which is all very distracting when you're just trying to get back to the game.

A large chunk of the gameplay is running, jumping, shooting at monsters, and falling with style through these crates while tryiung to collet loot.  Sometimes the crates have an absurd number of monsters in them and you have to get creative if you really want the loot.A smaller portion of the game is collecting every unique loot item found in the levels.  Collecting more unique loot gives you a higher rank and some starting bonuses at the beginning of each level.  Extra cash, bullets, etc.Anyway it's fun and I recommend it."
