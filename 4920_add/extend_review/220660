Pathetic.This was a total waste of my $29.99,  I bought it under the pretense of Multiplayer being released first major patch after final release from my Friend who recommended the game.  The Developer has come to the conclusion that by changing the Engine and flushing out his original Idea for a game, that he can now  make ANOTHER game and wants money for it, the full game that he originally wanted to make but couldn't.   This is the result made by a very poor decision long ago to use the wrong Engine <Sunburn> for his project, an engine that Microsoft dropped and everyone in the know knew was a dead-end, months before Zero decided to release the game as Final.  Nothing about the programme changed between final beta release and the first day of Final Release in April.The above mentioned Steam Group is a place for free discussion about Stardrive, and its Developer that You are going to purchase a beta, abandoned game from.  The Developer will finish it on his whim alone, that could be years or decades.  These are all direct from the developer, but sadly I can't direct you to the correct site to see them, he has, or has had his Minions, delete threads full of direct quotes from Zero you simply wouldn't believe if I wrote them here, thinking I was a Troll.  I hope this shows I gave 90+ hours trying to play this game, and never completing 1 game.  Buy this game if you like someone lying to you all the time, some do I suppose."

The store page continued to promote features that were never implemented for months after it was clear that they were never going to be added to the game. Making matters worse, the developer has demonstrated extremely bad judgment when interacting with customers that shows a lack of professionalism. This combined with a loyal but rabid fan base make this game a toxic property that is best avoided."

The Developer secretly worked on the second game behind the scenes, using our money to fund his work rather than finishing the first one and then even having the cheek to Kickstart the second game for even more money? Only to then sell this second game back to us again, at full price! Complete rip-off. Now we're left with nothing but a broken demo. I will NOT be buying the second game and funding such a dirty, cheap money making scheme and I'd advise that others do the same. The only way these developers will learn NOT to cheat their customers, is if they have no custom. As bad as EA as far as I'm concerned."

The Steam forum is pretty heavily moderated and the developer has a habit of deleting threads and banning people left and right before and during a big sale, so this is where people go to talk about the game however they like and not risk having their threads deleted because they didn't like the game.***I bought this game when it was in Early Access and... I thought it was amazing. Full of promises and ideas. Back then, the developper was promising updates pretty much left and right. Multiplayer was to be added to the game. Rare resources, laying mines, better diplomacy, being able to make joint operations with allies; all of these things were to be added to the game... But none -- NONE -- were implemented. The game you can buy right now is very much the same game I bought in Early Access, minus a few bugs. Hell, some core features such as the freighters are still buggy...So, that being said, is this a good game? Well, it's an okay game. I spent several hours on it so obviously it's not totally terrible. But the thing is, most of these hours (I'd say two third of them -- yes, that much) was trying mods and messing around waiting for the content update to come. When the Developper announced that he screwed up and decided the game was done and could not be updated anymore because of engine limitations, I stopped playing altogether.To make up for it, the owners of StarDrive will get a discount on his next title and access to some kind of multiplayer mini-game is going to be free. The thing is : his next game is going to be a turn-based strategy game. I bought a real-time strategy game. His next game is going to get as close to a MoO2 clone as he can. Good things for the fans, I guess, but that's not what I bought.So, to sum things up: this game is half-finished, features are lacking, it lacks polish and is very, very rough around the edges and is developped by one of the worst indy dev ever as far as PR and ""I care for my customers"" are involved. There are better games out there to spend your money on.But hey, that's just my opinion.***Edit #1: the multiplayer mini-game has been abandoned as well. Yes, that is yet another fail to put on Zero Sum Games resume. Also, that discount I was talking about? The one the owners of StarDrive will get? That will just be a Steam coupon with an expiration date. Great, eh? Way to tell your customers to hurry it up or screw you, Zero. Way to go indeed."

Trade ships don't work properly which will render your population starving despite having a food surplus.

But it's supposed to be a feature-complete, finished game, right?).The game still do not feature alterable gameplay options, leaving you with only the options of adjusting video and audio.The game's features such as customizing races are great, and the shipyard ship-designing is really fun - but if it doesn't matter in the slightest, it isn't really that much of a draw, is it?I don't really think that I can recommend this game as it is at this stage. It has a lot of really cool stuff going for it, but when crucial elements of the game remains broken, that's really just bad.

We, the ones who bought in early in development, had further dreams of playing this complex and (even in early stages) fun game.Then it started. Features began to be stripped off the list due to engine limitations (I might add that other early access games have successfully carried out full-engine ports when the limitations of the initial engine became apparent and at no additional expense to the existing financial backers...). The dreams and promises slowly turned to ash in our mouths as this unfinished and limited product got promoted out of beta (some having suggested just in time for sales to boast visibility...).I gave up on this product completely. I wouldn't have thought about it again had I not accidentally clicked into it's forum (I was aiming for Starbound). ""What do you want from Star Drive 2?""In summary this product is a promise. It is a shadow of what it could have been and it is well-and-truly abandoned; as even IF the developers take the time to add an additional patch simply to avoid it being permanently labeled 'abandonware' my confidence in the devs doing anything to address any additional bugs (least of all those that are likely to be added into the game by a half-arsed, smoke-and-mirrors patch) is nil.A grave disappointment all round and I truly wish the best for any whom buy into this product (or other products) as I feel burned by this developer and wouldn't wish that upon them."

And given that you have to do through a, by default, hidden folder to reach the saves directory then not everyone is going to know how to manually delete them.I've wiped my saves folder a few times. The first was after Pre-Warp mode was released. I wiped three gigs of save files. The next was after I decided to start using Tech Level Mod, and I wiped 2 gigs worth of save files. Eventually, I wiped those saves out as well clearing out roughly 3 gigs of space.I wiped my save folder again recently, hadn't done it for a long time, and got rid of 6.3 gigs worth of saves. Counting all these saves, I had roughly 14.5 gigs worth.That's practically the size of a completely new game. And if I didn't know how to reach the saves folder, I'd have never thought about cleaning the folder out because well... how large can something as simple as save files get?Given how much space you can eventually rack up in saves, it's rather sad that Stardrive doesn't include a easier way to get rid of them."

Although you can pause and set the speed to 4x normal (although it would be nice if it could go even faster).The UI stinks. You can't control planetary production or spies as a whole, in groups, auto-repeating, etc. It becomes very grindy just setting up production clicking to add, next planet, click to add, next planet, etc. There's way too much of that crap.The game crashes in longer games.The game doesn't handle too many ships very well. It should really have a unit cap or something but it doesn't and so you can build too many units and mess up your gameplay.There's no multiplayer.The AI interaction sucks. There's not much you can get the AI to do. You can't really coordinate anything with them. It is a shame since 4x games are fun to play cat and mouse with the npcs and pit them at war with each other.Also when you get someone to join your alliance they become part of your race or whatever and they vanish out of existence and you just control all of their units. This also reduces the amount of AI interaction because everyone either joins with someone you don't like or with you and then it's just a 1 v 1.There's a lot of other reasons why this game fails. I have to admit...it is a great genre and the real time space fights especially since you get to custom build them (although it's not as good as it could be but that's another issue) are really fun to watch...but in the end, there are just a waterfall of shortcomings that make this game something nobody will remember.Get it if it is super cheap like a few bucks and you like 4x and RTS.

Ship customisation was nearly as in-depth as Galactic Empires V (less techs/weapons, but firing angles matter) and loads of good ideas were there in the making. UI was a bit awkward, but still functional once you had a grip on it and it did not seem impossible to improve.Nearly 3 years later I decided to see how it evolved. Well, it did not. At all.I read the negative reviews and I understood why. The dev went to make the sequel Stardrive 2 instead of delivering a good product. Apparently, that sequel is even more ambitious (yet reuse most of the Artwork) but also even more flawed, unpolished and unfinished). Basically he repeated the same pattern.It is very sad this Zerosum had 2 golden chickens in his hands and instead of collecting eggs over decades, he chose to break their necks and eat them immediately.

Wow, a real-time 4X game? Sounds great!...It's terrible!I don't like to have to say this about a game that I put money into, but it has to be said for the good of humanity / the steam community. But why such a harsh approach?1. The interface lacks any polish. It's bad, everything is hard to manage. You will feel the pain once you are 10 minutes into the match as it becomes impossible to manage anything. There is no good notification system and you will probably neglect something important for a good 5 minutes of the game.2. The game isn't finished. Yep, it's broken. There are many bugs left in the game and it is NOT feature complete as it says on the steam page. Yes the game is playable, that does not mean it's done. Many of the features the developer promised never made it into the game, and he is making no effort to fix any of the issues the community has presented. Which brings me to my next point.3. The developer has abandoned the game. He has ditched the project and is now working on StarDrive 2, which is basically StarDrive 1 but actually polished. The developer has even gone to the extent to delete all threads which criticize the game. So now everything on the community page looks positive and isn't showing the truth about the game. Luckily he can't delete steam reviews, so I have one last hope to convince you the reader to save your money for a better game.4. The game is just over-priced! I mean really. There are so many better games for half the price or even less. It's not even worth the money. Please buy a real game. The developer himself said this was his 'experiment'."

My advice to the developer is to hire someone who is good with interfaces and the other various front-end facing pieces of the project.

The AI was weak and it very quickly became an AI curbstomp in my first game while still learning the mechanics.  The game is strategically shallow.  There is an obvious need to spam troops.  A good technology tree is essential and this game was distinctly lacking in that respect.  The ground invasion mechanic is very simplistic.The ship design is cool.  The combat is okay but I vastly prefer Sins of a Solar Empire.  I didn't really notice any of the bugs and missing features that some people go on about but then for $8 my expectations were low.The Developer takes an extremely hard line to Moderation which is often unfair and unreasonable.  I've recently seen a poster banned and all his posts deleted despite the fact not a single forum rule was broken.  Some of my posts have also been deleted despite also never breaking a forum rule.  Unfortunately the Developer is stuck in the habit of shooting himself in the foot with respect to the future of his own community.http://steamcommunity.com/groups/SDVC/discussions/0/I really don't understand why some consider the game groundbreaking. I would rate Distant Worlds Universe, Endless Space, Galactic Civilisation 2 and Sins of a Solar Empire Rebellion all as significantly better games, each in their own way.

Unfortunately, this will never happen as the developer (a guy going by the name of ""Zero"") simply proclaimed the same beta-level product as ""final"" and proceeded to publicly state that any future progress will be solely at his own personal ""whims"".At the time of this writing (10/10/13), the game is known to be *extremely* buggy with large swaths of functionality crippled or non-existant. Past promises of additional features go unfullfilled (multiplayer, etc.). Further, anyone with the gall to complain about the situation (however civil they may be) on the developer or Steam forums is promptly banned and any associated content is deleted (I know this because I have similarly been banned from the StarDrive Steam forums). NOTE: My specific offense... The action that immediately prompted my banning... was that I noticed that a particular thread which was critical of StarDrive was deleted and so I asked why. I suspect that the aggressive action being taken against anyone who complains is a result of the game currently being on-sale, advertised on the Steam main page as a ""daily deal"" (Zero surely wouldn't want customers' 100% valid concerns & complaints to negatively affect sales of this very dead project).Check the StarDrive forums on Steam for yourself and you will certainly come across content from angry customers who (rightly) feel cheated - that is, if you get to it before said posts are deleted. As I write this, StarDrive is being advertised & sold on Steam's front page. I sincerely pity anyone unfortunate enough to purchase this steaming pile only to inevitably find out how they've been robbed.What's most offensive (aside from the literal theft which is being perpetrated - that is, the game being advertised as beyond beta and fully functional), is the *EXTREME* arrogance displayed by the developer. Observe a snippet from a forum post on the official StarDrive website (before it was deleted):""Zero: I'll be as clear as I can be... I think StarDrive vanilla is a fine game. I'm happy with it. I'll be patching it here and there as my whims take me. If you feel cheated by StarDrive, kindly scroll up to the upper right portion of your browser screen and click the ""Logout"" button. I don't want to hear it.""There you have it, directly from the horse's (Zero's) mouth. The game, in its currently crippled and bug-riddled state will only be worked on if Zero's ""whims"" allow. Further, if you purchase the game only to find out that it's unplayable in many ways, don't bother complaining because he absolutely does not care (after all, he already has your money).Would *you* knowingly purchase something from a person or company which displays such a low opinion of the customer's (absolutely valid) concerns? I didn't think so. Neither would I. Do not support this developer. Such behavior in business should absolutely not be rewarded.DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!!Update (10/11/13): Immediately following the end of the StarDrive front-page sale on Steam, I found myself no longer banned on the forums. While I guess it's a ""good"" thing that I'm no longer banned, it speaks quite loudly for the theory that the recent aggressive ban-hammer usage was indeed due to the developer not wanting negative forum posts to affect sales (regardless of their validity). In addition, the forums are back to being predominantly full of complaints where as yesterday such threads were being deleted as fast as they could be posted."

As mentioned above, my verdict still stands. The game was completely abandoned and has many glary late game bugs that will give you an anuerysm just to want to complete it. I have also been following stardrive II. If you go to the forums and read reviews, the developer appears to be is treating the 2nd game as the first. The only added difference is now there is DLC, not borthering to fix the bugs already in the game, and is more concerned about earning money then improving and making a worthwhile 4x game that is fun to play and has great depth. There are many other options to choose from to have a good 4x experience. A great example would be stellaris, which is more of a grand strategy in space.(7/14/2017)The developer is currently making a new game, Longsword. As you can clearly tell, he has abandoned his first and 2nd game. He will also ban people who speak to this on his offical site.

Here's why:1) You can discover the entire galaxy with literally your first scout ship with almost no impunity.  No need to develop a drive or anything.2) You can seemingly spend your time waiting on research building way points that connect virtually everywhere (seemingly no drawbacks or economic penalty for doing this).3) Economy is ENTIRELY population based.  Expanding your empire's economy relies on you NOT building any actual buildings (at least early).  Maintenance costs on buildings that are designed to increase food, defenses, or production ALL drain more out of your income than actual ships, so it's better to just colonize and send colonists and food to the planets for seemingly forever till they have enough people to grow.  Just a bizarre concept that doesn't feel rational to me, there really is no option to have a small, but robust empire. It's zerg expansion or die.4) Conquering enemies, likewise, involves nothing more than zerg tactics (i.e. spamming smallers missle ships and troops).  All you have to do is land more troops on the planet than the enemy has and it's soon yours, you can actaully do that by flying right past their defense fleet and zerg landing while a small number of attacks ships keeps their fleet busy.  Very silly strat but works easily.5) Diplomacy is haywire. People either love you to death regardless of your actions or they want to murder you out right.  Then they simply want to join with you or your enemy, effectively taking the diversity out of the galaxy and matching one big against another big.  Really saps the interest in the game.6) Ship design is convoluted and seemingly pointless.  You don't know what you need to put and where and there is no manual whatsoever to figure it out.  Simply putting a power source on a ship isn't enough, you need to add wiring that connects the guns or the shields or the bridge to that power source....at the expense of things like armor.  It's like a really terrible game of minesweep to be honest and I like complexity in games, I play 4x games and Paradox games like EU, CK2, and Hearts of Iron....but this ship design leaves me baffled.All in all, this just feels like a very incomplete game that could have been much better if things like the economy and diplomacy had been fleshed out.  The battle system is fun to an extent, but it boils down to zerg tactics.  Bring enough cheap to produce missle frigates and focus fire for the win, leave the tactics at home.I can't recommend this game."

He pretty much cheated me 30€ which is ridiculous now that I think I could have bought two or three reasonably priced, well reviewed and recommended indie strategies.In the end, if you want decent single-player space RTS, buy this, but if you even little care what kind of business model or people your money is going to, please dont.Be responsible consumer."

It will never be finished nor its bugs fixed. Some of these bugs are game-breaking and there are many features that are either incomplete (to name but one: game mode. You can choose it when you start a new game, you get to choose only one option, though -_-) or inexistant.Now to the game itself, it is an ok game that appears to be a rip-off of a lot of games, but the ship designer as well as space battles are genuinely fun. I would almost call the initial ships being crappy a stroke of genius since it gives you a nice challenge to build good ships for each faction and possible tech configurations etcetera, this part is really fun. The automation of building them is ok, and putting them in fleets is very nicely done with the fleets manager.The gameplay itself, not so much. You initially start with one planet, and the one whom colonizes the most suitable planets the first is generally the first to win. If your race has improved metabolism that is every planet with 0.8+ fertility. Mind you those planets tend to be rare (10-15% of all colonizable planets I think?), which only makes it worse that you can also choose to make your race cybernetic. Combine that with industrious and improved metabolism and suddenly your requirements have changed to all planets with 0.8+ production instead (assuming 20-25% tax rate). This basically means 75% of all colonizable planets, most of them being uninteresting to other races except the Opteris (cybernetic), mainly for this reason, that race can actually pose a challenge in the hands of the ai.Granted, you can research stuff to make all planets viable for colonization or bother with crappy food transportation, but that goes against colonizing fast.So combat: by default, you are at peace with every race. If you have troops/fleets in orbit of each of their planets cabable of annihilating them in a few seconds they will not care. If they intercept one spy they are likely to declare war, but with war you get space battles! Still, if you choose the best possible strategy, there will be no space battles: as long as your military strength is higher than your opponents', only the Opteris will ever dare attack you. And even when it is not, half the ai players will generally just seek peaceful relations (pacifist/cunning/honourable ais). There are also planetary battles: capturing planets through troops. Troops cost no maintenance, though, so flooding each of your planets with troops is a sure way to win: the ai will never bomb your planets.Remember the game-breaking bugs? One of them involves unlimited production! It involves having shipyard, you spend 10 spare production on a ship, get 13 invested, cancel it, and now you have 13 spare! The shipyard effect even stacks with multiple shipyards, so I don't think I need to tell you how horrible it is to leave this bug in the game.Overall I give this game a 4.0/10Kicking dumb ai asses does make me feel better, but you are better off with something like Distant Worlds."

It was in alpha/beta though and Steam was nice enough to point me at the products webpage, because as handy as steam is they cant list all of a products features on their little webpage (I dont think it had the read more tabs at the time).  Looking at the developers product page and seeing youtube videos of what you are going to purchase is just good consumer behavior so that you know what you are purchasing.   It looked really interesting and offered things such asMoo2 like but RTS 4xMultiplayerCreate your own fleet designsSpecial Missions in which you assume control of an individual ship instead of a whole sideA sandbox mode with an engaging storyline.Neutral factions like remeneant and piratesA variety of random Galaxy events.Shortly after buying in the developer said he was temporarly removing multiplayer to work out the kinks. Of course the sandbox storymode wasnt finished yet but thats ok it was in beta and we saw how it was going to work with researching technologys and contacting a neutral planet and yadda yadda.  And watching the WTF is, along with other videos I knew what to expect with late game latency, so when people bashed on it I spoke up for it, telling people to give it time.  As a one person developer a 1-2 year wait for him to fix things up was acceptable.  Especialy for a game that had already been in development for something like 4 years.  But it was nearly done,  so we should hold on before making judgements.  I made guides, tried to help people out,and gave suggestions.But the longer it went on the more sour it got.  A couple weeks out of its -short- Beta when we could no longer get refunds there was a 50% off sale.  A couple months after that we were told Multiplayer would never make it to the game and that maybe in a stardrive 2 we would get it.   Special missions were abandoned all together.  The Galaxy events were restricted to simple planatary shifts for fertility/richness.  The Remenent story-arc was removed (and then later reintroduced in a shoddy manner).  Some of the AI's were just left in a crippeled state.   And then afterall of that there was a Fertility/abundance nerf across all difficultes (that the AI ignores) that you cant disable... Why nerf fertility/abund in a single player game?  A -lot- of players got banned from the message boards for silly things and it was a pretty rage induceing time all around.But thats ok I thought,  I decided to give him more time.  He said development would 'slow' while stardrive 2 was in development but we could expect improvements.  I decided to wait for SD2 to get finished before looking back and seeing what has changed.So this last week I gave it a try again.  And I have to say i am not very happy with it.  I enjoyed the game more during beta and after 'release' with the late game slowdown then I do now.  Sure some small bugs were fixed with fire arcs and its a little bit smoother.  But several AI's just sit there and let other AI's conquer them with out putting up a fight, several races just refuse diplomacy of any sort (usualy the ones that are conquering other ai's),  and the AI still cheats up the wazzoo building fleets it cant possibly support.  And overall it feels really bad fighting over a 4 population planet with a 1.2 fertility and 1.1 richness because thats the best there is out there.In the end the game currently (may 2015) feels unfinished (even more so then during beta), and in need of a good AI patch, a balance patch, a few new galaxy option sliders to combat what was done post release, and maybe a gamemode paid DLC.I'm gratefull for the 33% discount on SD2 for SD1 owners,  its a nice gesture.  And I really do hope SD2 turns out well, and can compete with other games in the turn based strat genre. But in the end this game also made me deicde to hold off on SD2 until its cheep as dirt.. because no matter how good it looks 'now'  it could be a lot worse in 6 months.   And thats just not something I ever really expected to say about a game.ps- yes I know my spelling sucks. Hopefully it wasnt too bad."

Aún así, el desarrollador lo ha dejado a medio hacer, y eso se nota mucho. A continuación enumero las las cosas que más me han sacado de quicio:1-No hay tutorial. Hay un hermoso botón donde dice ""tutorial"" pero se trata tan solo de una pequeña presentación que te muestra lo básico de lo básico. En un juego que se vanagloria de tener tanta profundidad como éste tal cosa no es aceptable.2-El juego tiene amplias opciones de automatización (admistración automática de planetas y flotas, recursos, etc). Sería genial, si no fuera porque no funciona. Deja un planeta en manos de la IA y te lo joderá seguro.3-En las partidas avanzadas, la incesante actividad de flotas y las constantes batallas por todo el mapa ralentizan de forma considerable el juego. No es un problema de mi máquina, pues ha sido documentado por mucha más gente en los foros.4-En mi caso, después de una larga partida de algo más de 10 horas, al día siguiente el juego se niega a funcionar correctamente, congelándose la pantalla cada 4 ó 5 segundos. Por esa razón lo he desinstalado.En conslusión, si lo encuentras barato (menos de 7-8 eur), puedes jugártela y comprarlo si tienes muchas ganas. Pero ten en cuenta que si encuentras algún bug gordo o te molesta alguna de las cosas anteriores, ningún desarrollador lo va a solucionar.CONSEJO: SI ESTÁS BUSCANDO UN JUEGO DE ESTRATEGIA 4X, VE A POR LOS TÍTULOS MÁS CONSOLIDADOS QUE ÉSTE.ENGLISHThe game has a lot of content and features very good ideas, however the developer left it incomplete to work on another project (see Stardrive 2). The fact that this game is unfinished and unpolished is really evident sometimes. Let me show you the 4 things that angry me the most:1-No tutorial. Yeah, there is a big shiny button tagged ""Tutorial"" in the main menu, but it's just a slideshow that provides little to no useful info. In a game which aims to be so deep and complex, this is a serious issue.2-Automatization. The game let's you give control of various tasks to the AI. Almost anything from planet management to Empire defense can be managed by the machine. Problem is, the AI is stupid.  Give it control of a planet and all the population will be dead in no time.3-The endgame CPU consumption will kill your computer. Although this game is not exactly FarCry 3 graphics wise, the constant battles and endless activity during an advanced game will cause freezing and periodic stuttering. This issue has already been documented in various forums.4-In my case, after 10 hours of ""successful"" playing, now the game refuses to even work properly, causing stuttering even when I'm at the main menu and taking about 5 minutes to load. For this reason I uninstalled it.In conclussion: if you really like the concept of this game or feel like playing, buy it if you find it at a good price (less than 8 eur). Keep in mind, however, that this game is already considered ""complete"" by the developer, and so none of the issues explained above, along with those that you find, are going to be fixed.ADVICE: IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A 4X GAME, GO FOR THE MORE POLISHED TITLES"

No has been compensated in any way, and this broken, unfinished mess is now being touted as a complete game.As for the specific issues with the game:PROS-1. It is a 4X game played in real time. That allows for a number of new strategies not possible in the ordinarily turn-based genre.2. Stardrive brought something new to the 4X table with the ability to design/fit your ships from scratch. This was the core pulling factor of the game. With customizable ships, you could choose from a pre-existing hull and redesign the ship to suit whatever specialised need. Titanic capital ships dedicated to bombing a planet into a foetid hellhole (i.e. conducting Exterminatus)? Done. Beam cannons on a fighter? No problemo. Or how about a logistics ship to provide repairs to your fleet on the go? All possible.CONS-1. The Sunburn engine is a laggy unoptimized mess. The framerate basically commits suicide during mid to late game, and especially in the middle of large fleet battles involving more than a hundred ships, even more so with the fact that the game runs in real time. The devs took a bad gamble opting to use a new engine with little repute, and lost.2. The AI is shallow at best, and in the state the devs had left the game, you can't do much more than basic threatening, bargaining, and decaring war. Some of the interaction options do not even seem to have any real purpose or effect.3. The game claims to be mod-friendly, however due to the limitations of the engine it can only run 1 mod at any time.4. Planetary interaction with colonies and ground troops could truly be better. Every ground unit across all the playable races are basically just reskins of one another, and the gameplay lacks any sort of strategic depth beyond throwing as many troops as possible at the enemy (or as many as you can fit on the map). Building placement doesn't appear to have any strategic element either.5. Finally, the game devs abandoned the sinking ship while all the passengers were still on board. Didn't say a word. One day they just went *poof*, and no one heard from them again until they began advertising their ""new"" game.'nuff said.Such a pity, really. This game had so much promise...."

The diplomacy is pretty light, though not the worst in the world. But for a game about ship combat, there's a surprisingly small amount of control, as aluded to earlier, you get no notifications when your ships are in combat, nor can you zoom to your ships or padlock ther camera on a ship (only your flagship and any ship you manually take control of) which makes the game seem incomplete. So many features seem unfinished or rushed and there's no word from the DEV on fixes or further development.

For example homeworlds always used to have 2 richness and 2 fertility.  now every time I start a game the homeworld only has 1 richness which makes an already long game take hours longer.

It offers a unique experience and I find myself coming back again and again to play it. That being said I would not recommend it unless it was on at least a 75% sale as the game is not complete and pretty much never will be because the dev dropped it.Now you can play the game, it isn't broken you can play and finish a scenario but this game was abandoned and a lot of promises that were made were broken by the dev so there is lack of content and after a few games you get the gist of how things will go and the prospect of losing goes out the window even on the hardest difficulty. The Blackbox mod can fix this a bit but overall it's a problem. In addition you will suffer a lot late game due to poor optimization that even a really powerful system can't power through. I put a lot of time into this game on my 3570k which was overclocked to 4.8Ghz and on the larger universe settings I still had significant slowdowns and juttering which can and will render the zoomed in direct fleet control unplayable. It basically leads to you sending massed fleets into enemy held systems and hoping that the AI can take care of things.The best thing to do is the leave the universe size to normal and use the Blackbox mod to limit the number of ships the AI can have because if you don't you will quickly find that the AI will continue to pump out droves of ships and each one will make the game run a bit worse after a certain point. That being said if you have a recent Intel based chip(Sandy or newer) your system should easily be able to handle around around a thousand ships in the universe without significant slowdowns.Probably my favorite thing about the game is the ship customization. In a word it's friggin cool and it really makes you feel good when your ship you designed is good enough to take on three or four ships of an equivalent class of ship and come out on top. That is I think the thing that really keeps me coming back because I keep finding better and better ways to build my ships and it feels really engaging.To wrap up this game had loads of potential but it was let down by poor choices made by the dev in both the way they made the game and how the handled the abandonment of it. It is in no way worth the standard $30 asking price, you can pick it up for the unique experience but only if it's less than $10."

Simple enough.Problem is that the game is highly buggy, full of memory leaks and other instabilities. This is a real shame considering how brilliant the game design is.

The few crashes I did have were after marathon sessions of 12+ hours of playing. Over the years I tend to encounter very few bugs or other issues in games so I may just be very lucky.Some of the mechanics weren't well explained but a little trial and error would produce the answer. In my experience if no explanation or trial and error is needed to figure out how a game works then the game has been dumbed down and will offer very little.I've seen a lot of complaints about the developer not finishing the game and other issues but it ended up being exactly what I expected it to be.

As a result, I belive you should either try this game for its realatively unique real time space (most other 4x games do this due to preformance problems) or wait for the sequel for a hopefully improved game.Edit:I'm now more optimistic(watched thexpgamer's video on it) about stardrive 2 cause it does have real time combat, but you can only place ships right in front of the enemy and can't get reinforcements in battle.

There's not much point researching ships bigger than frigates - all you need are some ships to keep the enemy's ridiculously weak fighter fleets at bay while you infantry rush them.""Not finished"", as others have said, in the sense that the whole game feels very shallow, but it's not buggy enough to really be considered a beta either - I'd call it a finished product, though it's not a great one. Not a bad game in some ways, but very little replay and not worth $30.Yeah, I know I have like 170 hours on this despite saying very little replay. To be frank, I don't usually complete my 4X games because I get frustrated with the late game grindy-ness, and thusly, I did get quite a bit of time on Stardrive, which does certain parts of the mid-game reasonably well. Besides that, I bet at least 100 of those hours was spent designing ships, which is probably the best designed aspect of the game.But unfortunately, that is the big issue with the game as well - designing ships, the most interesting part of the game, is not really actually all that important in terms of gameplay. You can certainly min-max the ♥♥♥♥ out of your transport ships, and design ultra-badass capital ships with hangers (which don't work, by the way) and plague bombs (because you can't blow up planets) and death rays, but in the end it doesn't really matter because you are really only going to build a bunch of frigates armed with super-missiles to crush the pathetic enemy fleet while you infantry rush him. Did I mention you can't blow up planets?It sounds like I'm ♥♥♥♥♥ing about a specific tactic that works too well, and that someone with my hours is probably just good at the game. What I'm really trying to do here is save you money - this is not the easiest way to win the game, it's how you play the game, period. If you don't do it, the ultra-slow AI will eventually do it to you after several hours of ingame time, or at least try to. I personally used that time to build up a giant empire and a fleet of death ships that squished his little army without me having to do much of anything. Then quit and restarted because I realized that, nope, that was it, and now I'd have to spend two hours invading defenseless planets after I stocked up on cans of SPAM.Not that you need an empire. You can easily ♥♥♥♥ everyone's day up with 10 planets if you are smart about what you build and research. Hint: Build and research everything, because the AI is slow as a turtle in concrete and will still be using popguns while you rock rocket launchers. There's also only a dozen or so things to build, and everyone has the same research trees, so you don't really need to prioritize well.All of this is somewhat redeemed by the multiplayer mode, though. Because humans are not slow as ♥♥♥♥, you actually need to play the game in a fashion that bears some semblance to strategy. Infantry spamming is still the only tactic, but you now do need a proper navy in order to get your troops to the ground. The community is vibrant and great, and you'll find that the people you play against generally are good folks who want to play the game rather than use these kinds of tactics however.Oh, right. :p"

Never mind, that's been cut. Endings? Blow up everyone you're not allied to, that's the only way to win last I checked.

Initially I kept getting crushed every game, leading me to concur with negative review posse. However, after giving StarDrive a chance,I feel like it will depend on the individuals 4x gaming expectation. Although there are some issues, StartDrive is a little more nuanced in some areas than others have indicated,for instance, you can join or form alliances, develope a spy network to gain tactical advantage by stealing tech or by sabotaging rival civs covertly. Designing ship loadouts is cool cause it lets you upgrade your fleets tactical capabilities as needed to expand your empire,strengthen alliances and crush the opposition. I enjoyed using covert methods to aquire, or to sabotage a rival civ .I found that SD offers an unpredictable, quirky style that might change whats expected in a 4x space title. In summary SD marries an asymetrical  universe with challenging 4x game play, Stardrive marches to its own drummer  with some in game quirks, but I its worth the price of admission. By the way, the Black Box Mod expands player options and reduces a lot of the the unwanted quirks. I say buy it!!!"

I will lastly add that the thing I was most aggervated at was the teraforming as I normally enjoy them but it is just bad as it could take me and hour to get two or three squares open for industry and agriculture and it was a late game thing when, in my opinion, the pace of the game should have made it early to mid game.

I should have known better than to purchase a game without reading the reviews. As stated by the reviews, the game was unplayable due to excessive bugs and lag when first downloaded. However, one thing that I have found very strange about this game is that the more you play it and the more you explore, the less likely bugs are to occur (kindof like the exact opposite ofMinecraft). IDK if this happens on everyone's computer or if it is just a wierd quirk of mine, and I have no idea how this could happen in terms of programming, but for about the last hour of playtime (about at 10ish hrs.), I have never seen any lag or not registering clicks to the degree that I first experienced it in the game. I still have some pretty significant trouble with the game not registering my mouse clicks, but it has become at least playable, and the problem is now only a minor annoyance, unlike the total hairpulling frustration upon first download. Sometimes, due to lag, it still registers that I clicked on something that I moused over earlier, rather than what I actually have my mouse over at the time of the click. I wonder if a similar phenomenon caused the programmer(s) to think that the bugs were fixed when they were unable to reproduce reported bugs.If you have the patience for the bugs, the game itself isn't too bad. The ability to adjust your species for tactical, RP, or mixed  gameplay allows you to play a species according to your own interpretation of how they are or what they could be. I prefer a much more strategic and magical Vulfen to the brutish, early-game swarmers version that they are set to by default (retaining their militaristic tendancies, because IMO Vulfen aren't really Vulfen if they are too peaceful, but upon player preferance this could be changed too). It does have a fairlyStar Trek/Babylon 5type feel, which I very much appreciate. Diplomacy is critical, and there is a high degree of intrigue involved (though taking the few abilities and technologies for intrigue that exist will make it very simple, as max rank agents can pretty much do as they please at this point, only occasionally getting discovered or even foiled but not killed). Players should keep in mind, however, that there are few guides to this game, and the videos that are out there regarding this game often do not involve enough information to really give you the feel for things. With no tutorials missions, you will likely be completely lost in the beginning, even with deep research. For this reason, I would advise setting up your first species to give you a large margin for error. Additionally, I found race customization to be very confusing initially, but once you get it, it is very straightforward.I have come to enjoy the game in time, but I cannot bring myself to recommend this game for its current price. It is simply too high."

It is already well polished for an Early Access game and I daresay is better that some AAA titles that have been released in their final stages.The races are varied and interesting on it's own and it even allows you to customize them to suit your own needs while still remaining in a somewhat balanced state.The ship building is easy and fun, if I had one critique though, I wish there was a way to test my builds before seeing them utterly fail in battle because I didn't know how a module will react. That said, as it is now is plenty good enough to enjoy the game.Pros:- Playable and polished even in early stages, loads of fun to be had- Races are a joy to behold as they are varied and rather humorous in their depiction- Easy to learn, difficult to master makes this something even a newbie in the genre can pick up.Cons: *but this could change*- Currently, ship building doesn't have a way to test builds so guides might be necessary there- Increasing tax doesn't seem to have any negative impact at the moment or no value for measurement (ex: colonist morale)- Enemy ships don't display their insignia so it could take some practice to know who's fleet is whose in game."

So lets begin.While the game isn't buggy or unpolished by any means, it's because of the majority of it's design is absolutley awful, not to say everything is ♥♥♥♥♥♥, just most of it. Like the music, a fundamental part of any strategy game whether it's Master Of Orion or Civilization, the music is there to make you feel like a commander of a thousand fleets or a cultured world leader, and in both of the games mentioned the game does a great job doing that. But in StarDrive it's... uhhh...♥♥♥♥♥♥ The music sucks♥♥♥♥♥ It's a bunch of dreary melodies with a few space feeling instrumentals but all of them lack any sense of excitment. And that's the main problem, this game lacks excitment... or fun... or a reason to exist.I like ProJared's description of the game in his One Minute Review of the game. Hopefully ProJared doesn't mind that I'm gonna quote him.""It's like they took Master Of Orion 2 and made it realtime and then SUCKED all the fun right out of it.""That sentence alone can describe the whole game. Really, I could've stopped over a paragraph ago because that perfectly describes this game. And did I mention how this game is as slow as a snail in molases in a slow motion field? Even on the highest speed setting before you start, everything goes so SLOOOOWWWWW that you get bored after five minutes, even with the slightly cool shipyard (I say slightly cool because the best ship designs are the presets so you'll never need to use the shipyard) and the very amusing races. The game is so drab that it counteracts the good, and the game IS UNFORGIVABLY UNFAIR, meaning even on the easiest difficulty the A.I will CRUSH YOU UNDER THEIR BOOTS OF UNBEARABLE CRUELTY AND DELERIUM.Long story short, don't buy this overpriced crap, buy Endless Space, or hell, If your feeling nostalgic go onGOG.comand pick up Master Of Orion 1+2 for £5 or less.

The AI can be overly aggressive, but it draws a good balance between races which attack weaker prey, races who declare war because they see you as a threat, and races who could be peaceful allies (on conquerable foes, depending on your gaming style.)I'd like to see some small additions, like the ability to save custom race settings and either have them in a droplist or loadable from a file like they already have for custom ship designs.I really enjoy StarDrive.

How you place stuff (armor, power, weapons, etc) really matters. Also very fun to do.2. Combat - nice looking, dynamic combat.What is not so good (can be fixed by good mods though):1. Tech tree could be better.2. The game has a very strong snowballing effect - each civ's development is exponential and so minor differences in how you/computer micromanges stuff can lead to massive difference between civs' development/power in mid and late game. Can go both ways - you or one of AI opponents will become massively owerpowered compared to rest of universe at which point it will be much less fun.Also no multiplayer and there will not be any.Would i recommend this game? - Maybe.If you, like me, like detailed and complex ship design and lots of micro of both economy and combat in such single player games - then you will get a good number of hours of fun from this game even without mods.

The AI can be predictable if not boring. And frankly I'm not sure why they even implemented their diplomacy system. Maybe I just don't understand it's mechanics yet, but after playing for nine hours I feel like I should've mastered it, assuming it was functional. The lack of options within the menu can be annoying, there are no difficulty settings. The AI just automagically decide how hard they want to kill you. There are still a lot of annoying bugs. Specifically speaking, large capital ships tend to get ""stuck"" although their icons continue to move.

It was buggy, incomplete, and, as a result, it entirely deserved the low scores it received.Since release, however, the developers have worked hard to plug the holes and fill the gaps. The game is now, especially on sale, one that I would recommend to anyone who enjoys this genre.The strongest differentiator that sets StarDrive apart from competitors is the ship design. While some games allow you to choose your ship's weapons or shields, in StarDrive you build a ship from an empty hull to a bristling space cruiser. You select exactly where you want bulkheads, power plants, command centers, weapon banks, and sheild generators to be placed. As the research tree fills in, you'll open up even more opportunities to build new, larger hulls or moditfy your existing blueprints.Another area I enjoyed in StarDrive was the factions. Each faction is extremely unique in design and carries with it a lot of flavor. Whether your negotiating with the honorable but militant pandas or the robotic faction that's enslaved a race of owls - you'll find interactions to be a lot more interesting than the sterile diplomacy of many other games in this genre.In the end, StarDrive is exactly what it sets out to be: a 4x Space Strategy game with a robust ship builder and real time combat.

Unfortunately, no, probably not.  However, a good selection of features, and the module layout based ship creator, allow for some classic MoO style fun and enjoyment.The original launch of the game in early access had some issues from what I've read, but StarDrive was one of those games on my ""To Play"" list for almost a year before finally coming around to it after the latest patch (1.15 of this writing).  The core gameplay is there, but a tech tree that's lacking much depth is probably the most glaring flaw I've experienced in my playthroughs.This lack, thankfully, can be remedied with a mod which adds much more MoO-like tech tree into the game.  The current non-mod tech layout allows for a very balanced approach that was likely intended for multiplayer(which as of yet hasn't surfaced), with early ship designs still being marginally useful against even high tech ships late in the game.  For fans of MoO2 and it's tech singularity that often happened late game (Psilons, anyone?), this is a mixed blessing.As mentioned earlier, the ship creator is the main feature of the game, and the one I've had the most enjoyment from.  Going in blind, you'll come up with design iteration after iteration, and love each one as much as the one before.  Every module has a certain length and width that you try and shoehorn into the various ship hulls, with each race having a specific design.  There's generally an overall ""feel"" for each race's ships (such as long, relatively narrow hulls that allow for greater head on armor layouts for Terrans, or a greater number of possible weaponry on Kulrathi), and even the actual shape of the ship's hull can have very drastic effect when combat comes to your fleets.There is a slew of ease of use features in the game which makes play more friendly on the UI front.  Unfortunately, a lack of any decent game provided documentation makes some of these a complete secret until they're stumbled upon and discovered.  Definately do some searching for UI tips and tricks for this one.The tougher AI levels allows for some challenge, but expect the game to be a fairly easy breeze until you design some better ships for the AI to utilize.  The game has some of the spark of MoO, but it's not a drop-in replacement for it.Overall, I'm in love with StarDrive for what it is, not what it was promised or wished to be.  At it's core, it's engaging and enjoyable.  Hopefully the next offering from Zero Sum will be full spiritual successor that we long for, but this one is better than most MoO clones that pop up now and again."

You're the most promising space-themed Strategy game I've played, and that's both good and bad. You can be challenging at times, and despite having the re-playability of a 10 year-old's view of Peace and War, terrible, the fact that you are updated once every now and then has me sitting in bed, staring at the ceiling, wondering, ""What will be next?"" This game has far to go before reaching the elite status, but the steps it must take are simple things to add. This game has one play mode, Sandbox, in which starting out, you have one planet and a few spaceships, and you must find a way to colonize beneficial planets on the road to galactic empire. Other alien species will be right next door, and your actions can (possibly) decide whether or not war will ensue. There is a full tech tree and a very simple, yet important management system that you, as leader, must lead. Sweet and ultimate victory will not be achieved until every species you meet is either your friend (boring) or completely eradicated to the point of extinction (yay). If you decide to be an Adolf Hitler, you can with the ability to bombard any planet's (and I mean ANY) surface with nuclear weapons and murder every last thing that resided there. Did I mention there is also a full ship constructor as well? You can create your own vision of whatever the Super Star Destroyer was in Episode VI of Star Wars during the two minutes it was on screen, and giant, flying pieces of metal with a million death rays are always fun. But this game is SOOOO repetitive! Every game you start up will have the same sequence of events happen, and no matter what you do, they always seem to take place. There's no multiplayer(Note to creator of StarDrive: Make this happen!), and even with mod support, what is in the game to be modded will take a LOT of creativity to make something out of. This game is fun, don't get me wrong, but in order for a consumer to get his/her money's worth PLEASE wait for a sale(like me). ZeroSum, you have a rough diamond here, and polishing has been done, but it is far from the Hope Diamond. 7.25/10."

But you can built a empire!Ship design is for me the heart of the game, ship hulls are different for different civilizations. The fun part is how you use different components into the ship design to beat the other civilizations. since they have access to the same tech research as you. seeing your superior designs destroy them!! LIke a fleet of meat into your meatgrinder!For example my favorite is the Kulrathi aka bearmen their ships might not be the fastest(not too many engine slots, you can put in different type of engines into that slot). but their fighter are the largest in the game. I love putting in fighter bays(they spawn fighters(free fighters)) into all my Titan ships(they are the largest hull type every civilization gets, each civilization has different sizes and shapes of that hull). I love putting in remnant shields onto the fighters and tons of weapons and no wrapdrive only thrust. They can be respawn from the carrier. Park the carrier slightly farther away from the fighting. wave after wave of fighters just destroy anything in their path.With many patches later they fix the Remnant quest.

Star Drive a unique 4x game in that it does everything in real time. Now, Sins of a Solar Empire did the same, but get this: no phase lines here!  Go any where you want!This can lead to some preformance issues, as when you have transport ferrying things between planets and a  fleet fighting a bunch of ships at the same time things can slow down a bit.Also keep in mind this is not Space Empires, the rules here are differnt, you will have a bit of a learning curve here to learn the rules of this game. The Galaxy is also kinda bland. There are not many features in it besides Planets and Stars, you will not be encountering asteroids, a  Black Hole, or nebulas.However, the game it's self is fun and worth a look if you are a fan of 4X space games. The ability to design your own ships is nice, and the game has some cool visual effects. The differt empires you come across are full of character and varied.  The same planet rush situation is present in this game, grab what you can when you first start, but make sure you chose rigth and supply the planet with food until it can produce on its own!Cons-  not all features in when it first came out-  tech tree not that extensive... but there are mods you can easly add in.-  Map has planets and Stars, not a whole lot more then that.Pros-  Unique real time 4X game for those of you tired of hitting the end turn button. ships go boom.-  Exploring the galaxy and encountering the races is alwasys fun in this game.-  Mod support.-  Designing your own ships is fun.All in all, this is a decent game.....

I am a fan of this game but there could be a lot more to it seeing how old it is. However for the time, effort, and abilities of Zerosum Games it is a good game. There are ups and downs to the game. (A lot of downs)There are a few bad things about the game though. First there are some lag issues and stability problems. The game lags a bit when a lot of action is going on in a large galaxy. Second is mods. The whole game relies on mods at this stage to keep players interested and the game has a open mod folder to simply load one into. The website even comes with a tutorial on how to mod the game. Third is you have to be very meticulous to see what is going on when and where.The game focuses more on combat than economy or events. The game has events but none have any significance or really game changing results whether that'd be good or bad. Events have changed over the year this game has officialy been out, that means a few events were removed, others added or tweeked. Economy is good but needs more to it as well. The game has two resources, food and production. Food is used to feed your race and production is used from building structures to ships. Other than that it doesnt get any more complicated. The only tricky thing about economies is taxing and distributing resources.Combat offers a lot to the game seeing how that is the soul focus of gameplay. Ships can be custom designed with a traditional grid pattern and using moduels to fill them in. The possibilities are practicaly endless when it comes to combat.Dev did abandon the game unfortunatly. After the full game came out updates have become rare. The game has absolutely no purpose but sort of sandbox game letting you do as you please. The only downside to that is there is no story to the game, no story or big explanation about the mysterious ""Remnant"" race. All we get as far as story to any AI alien race is a short three sentence paragraph FROM the AI. And all we get for story behind the ""remnant"" is a short mini event quest that, when summed up, gives literaly a short two paragraph explanation on them.The game feels very open and at times too open. There needs to be more content before this becomes a real game because at this stage it does seem like a very high quality app than a full game."

THE most fun thing to is obviously the ship design. In my experience, you can take the basic frieght ship from the start of the game, outfit it with nuclear reactors, and then crash them into the enemy. You can create ships, that spew out dozens of tiny fighter drones. You can create ships bristling with poisonous spores, and then bombard your helpless enemies ground forces. You can assume direct control over titan ships, driving them like Jesse Pinkman in the Need for Speed movie. You can launch an armada of mobile space marines that can board and control enemy ships. I could keep going for a long time.Every piece of this game isn't just a statistic that somehow affects the game. If you research something, you will be able to see it, and use it. If you give some technology to another race, they will remember your kindness (even if they remember it as they are using that same technology to annihalate you).Ive gone on for longer than i intended which just goes to show how much I like this game.

76561198063959748,Recommended,220660,13811617,"Posted: 3 January, 2015",all,IronBeagle,"Having no idea of what the game was ""supposed"" to be, I simply bought the game expecting a fancier ""MOO2"" so to speak.    And given the negative reviews I kept reading about it, I lowered my expectations greatly and bought the game on massive sale.Once I actually played the game, I actually wound up enjoying it quite a bit.   I can't recall how many hours I've spent and how many ""races"" I've created in trying the game.  I'll try to rate the game on a 5-star system on each of the areas that I can think of:1.) Graphics - 4/5- I truly enjoyed the graphics.  I really did.  Being able to zoom in to my ships, the combat animations, the effects of each weapon being unique in their own right.  I especially like the unique ship designs for each race which attempted to match their species.  A little cliched, but then again, what game isn't nowadays?2.) UI - 3/5- Simple enough and inuitive.  A few grips would be on some screens where it seems like the UI was designed with a different resolution in mind.  I have an old monitor only capable of 1280 x 1024 and it stuggles on the setup screen due to odd text wrapping.  Other than that however, I felt the UI easy enough to navigate.3.) Gameplay - 3.5/5- I found myself in several sleepless nights playing that ""one more turn"" (or in this case, one more minute given it's real time).  The racial creation allows for varied types of empires to play around with and with each game randomizing the different empires behavior, it's always been a treat for me.  However, there is one glaring bug around the ""plot"" where if the AI winds up wiping out the triggers, you're SoL if that was your main goal for that particular round of gameplay.  I've actually had to go in to the XML save files to try to re-trigger the events which is never a good sign.  Still, that plot isn't the end-all-be-all of the game and isn't a deal-breaker for me.- Another nice twist is the actual race creator.  Unlike a true ""creator"", you simply overwrite a species for the current game.  However, any designs you create while playing that ""race"" become available to the AI in succeeding games so you eventually wind up fighting your own designs which was a real treat when I saw it happen.- Related to gamelay, there are a few things which could have been improved on in my opinion.   Tech Tree, for one, is smaller compared to other 4X games.  It only feels large due to the amount of research points needed to unlock higher tiers.  The AI also sometimes behaves oddly despite their racial setting at game time (i.e. an Honorable AI will sometimes keep stealing from you despite being in an non-agression pact).4.)  Replayability - 3/5- I admit I keep replaying the game.  For me, it's been enjoyable.  However, I do see 2 problems which can hinder it in other cases:a) Memory optimization: unlike other RTS games (which this game has flavors of), there is no unit cap other than your bank account (i.e. turn-by-turn income).  This is both a blessing and curse.  This means that you can build up quite the fleet and swarm your way through the galaxy.  Unfortunately this also means unless you've got godly amounts of RAM (and I'm talking 16+ GB of RAM), your game can quickly grind to a halt and crash as the AI will spam ships like no tomorrow.   Even the ""final plot story"" can break your game should you unlock it given that it also spams ships like no tomorrow (without the limitation of a factory's output to slow it down).  Related to this, beware of designing ""cheap"" gunboats.  As the race creator ""overwrites"" a species, any design you create becomes available to that AI race and it tends to favor spamming those cheap gunboats.b) No multiplayer.  I never expected this feature as I never was an early backer.  I can see how this would put off others as the challenge of beating down your frenemies always extends the life of a game.  The lack of this feature can put off many people from getting the game.c) Lack of a real ""custom"" race.  MOO2 had the same issues but it would have been nice to have a custom race that didn't overwrite existing ones.5.) Overall - 3/5- I liked MOO3.  Yes, I said it.  I actually came to like game.  StarDrive feels like what MOO3 tried to be.  4X strategy with RTS gameplay.  StarDrive for me is an enjoyable single-player 4X game which allows for some small to medium scale games.  Large games are completely out of the question due to the memory problem which would have raised the game to 4/5 or me.  If you ignore what was originally promised and take the game for what it is now, it's actually worth a try.I would purchase it when it's at least 50% off given the isssues and replayability challenges it may give others.For the current price of $32.99 CDN, I would instead spend it on Space Empires V or Pandora as they have a bit more replayability for most in my opinion."

76561198028212281,Not Recommended,220660,16033614,"Posted: 27 May, 2015",all,vagabond4,"This game is a lesson in bad management and bad design practice.You simply do not promise features in a game if you cannot deliver them.  You can publish a list of features that you desire to add if possible, but you only promise the core elements.  And then once in production, you do not just abandon the project to start a new game, especially a sequel.  It is an unwritten contract between the dev and the buyer that you will deliver a working game with as few bug as possible.As this game exists, the dev simply wasted to many development hours on a single feature.  The ship designing options in this game are hands down one of the best that I have seen.  You have so much control within the constraints put in place.  However, the whole purpose of a ship design is to utilize it in its function, typically combat.  And while combat is decent and some what fun, you need an economy to support it, and Stardrive simply does not have a well working economic model.In fact, the game ends up punishing you for the 1st 30 min to hour of play.  1st by making you feel like you need to grind a bunch of base technologies just to be capable of performing the basic functions of a 4x game.  You will need new planets to expand you economic abilities, but you will feel you need 4 technologies before you can successfully colonize a planet: a food tech, a production tech, an income tech, and the ability to expand on to prohibited terrain.  However, if you focus on these techs to quickly start expanding, the AI comes and smacks you around because your military is weak.  So lets say you focus on military techs (like guided missiles and armor; yah, no armor before this tech), your units are capable of carrying a basic fight, but the AI has now colonized any half-decent planet on the map.  But then you say to yourself, I've got a big military I will just invade a weaker AI.  Welp, hope your like rebels suddenly poping up on your worlds with no prior indication of unrest because your income rate cannot support even a half decent fleet unless you colonize new worlds.  But wait you say, I'll just build a smaller but higher tech fleet; nope.  Not enough fire power to successfully invade a AI held world because unsuprisingly the AI has a fleet just as big if just a bit smaller but like 3x the troops you were able to build.  And all of this early game will determine whether you will win or loose late game.However, this is not to say you cannot do well.  If you get lucky, the random map has placed habitable planets as neighboring systems, given you one of the less aggressive races as a neighbor, and not block those systems with hostile drones.  If you can survive this early game, the game can be a good bit of fun.  At least up until some late game bug or unfixed feature ends your fun.A game should not punish players for trying to perform the tasks the game demands or make them slog through a list of Techs that can make or brake their game just to successfully perform those tasks."

Glitches, crashes, saves corrupting, it all sucks. The basic gameplay is fun, but the game is unfinished, as-in prelaunch. It's a beta, not a finished product. The developers have completely moved onto a sequel instead of finished the game they already produced, and the reviews I'm hearing for that game sound exactly like this review. User content patches do what they can, but they can't finish the game for the producers.The overall gameplay is fun, if you can get past the awkward GUI.Ship building is complicated and fun. Building and conquering is well balanced. I just can't get past the GUI.Frankly, the GUI in this game is terrible, it's my number one complaint of this whole game. This is strange coming from the developers of Endless Space which has a perfect, smooth, awesome GUI.What's wrong with the GUI you ask? Several things.-Clicking on a button doesn't ""always"" click it. It just doesn't respond... it just.... doesn't....-Opening and closing the windows is awkward. The close button changes locations on every screen and disappears completely on others.-They tried to integrate some UI stuff from Endless Space, such as right clicking a window to make it close. However, it's not availble on every screen, so it just takes some testing and memorizing to find out which screen closes with right click which screen doesn't.-Information on several screens is just a mess, while on others it's just a massive block of text. Nothing seems to be organized very well or effeciently.-Ship selection is the biggest complaint I have of the GUI.-You can make control groups just fine, but shift + # doesn't add the current selection to the #'d control group. Having the control group you want to add to selected and shift+click-drag doesn't help either because that selects non-military ships as well.-You can't unselect a ship from the selection panel in the bottom left corner.-Ships move at different speeds, but there's no way to make a fleet/control group to move at the speed of the slowest ship.Overall, it just feels strange to navigate the UI. Some may call this nit-picking, but I don't. A game like this needs a smooth and fluid UI to be able to manage everything easily and quickly, while getting all the information you need on the fly. This game does not deliver on that.Another con of this game is the sound design. When ships are fighting, most of the time, you don't hear anything at all. Sometimes you hear the ship firing, and you get a 1/100 chance for the sound of the weapons firing to BLOW OUT your speakers. Turning the volume down doesn't help because then you can't hear any of the other sounds in the game. So, inevitablly, you just end up turning off the sound completely to avoid the jump scare every few minutes.After muddling through this game's crummy GUI, getting my ears checked by my doctor, and reloading the game through the crashes and the MASSIVE glitches, I'd give this game a D. Would not recommend this headache."

It has good looks.It unfortunately lacks polish.The game is unfinished in many regards, but to me more than anything else is the balancing system within it. It just doesn't feel rounded out well enough to truly be considered finished. There are some bugs, glitches, and at times a good deal of rough edges to it. The gameplay is clunky, its approach leaves it too easy to overlook the time spent and the overal mechanics are hit and miss. That issue of the feel hits me in two regards, and the major one is how the empire grows and develops feels forced, and does it in a way that makes growth sluggish untill you hit a stage of performance where you just jump leaps and bounds. the staggering hiccup there just jarrs the whole gameplay on edge. It shows in combat if you don't hit the growth right before the AI does and you try combat.Specifically the combat. systems designed to fulfil certain roles just don't. Many instances of the combat I am frustrated with how the AI will always outperform the player, and even on basic combat levels it shows to a starkingly annoying degree. The fleet system and ship controls on it sound good, but lacking that final polish to really make it a good system leaves much to be desired in combat - especially if you need to travel with ships capable of different speeds.I like the lpooks, some of the mechanics are done well I think - but lacking that balance and refinement to really turn this into a good game.If you want to see, wait for a good sale maybe, but I would argue just stay away."

Before early access, there was promises of a fully fleshed out experience. During early access, those promises remained. A few moments after first release, the dev stated that he will no longer be working on this game, so he may have time on his newer game which will be almost exactly like this game, only in a different engine, and hopefully better. He has also said that he plans to give all those who have bought StarDrive a discount on his next game, whenever it's released on Steam. Who knows how much of a discount that will be. Take a risk, buy this game discounted heavily in hopes that it will make the next game cheaper than the full priced original. Play this as the alpha that will never be finished.

What drew me to it the most is its innovative and thorough approach to ship design and combat.  If you'd enjoy spending 20 thought-filled  minutes crafting a customized inter-system war machine, this one's for you.  I should add that watching said war machine ply its trade is beautiful and enjoyable as well.  I loved almost everything about the design and implementation of the space combat in StarDrive.  Its real-time approach encompasses fighters, boarding parties, attack, defense, reinforcements, re-arming, repairing, bombarment, trade, support structures, warp speed and manuevering.However, I must also acknowledge that this game never overcame a certain lack of polish.  Confused AI, glitches, and underdeveloped or dead-ending side stories riddle the game.  In order to fully enjoy its excellent space combat system, you must learn how to work with the game's quirks and carefully guide the challenge level into an ideal range with practiced care.  I am amazed and impressed with what this game's creator(s) were able to accomplish.

There are also different perks you get to choose from when you start that effect your gameplay, like being ""robotic"" where you race consumes no food but eats production instead.The only downsides of the game are that the rounds can be long. Really long. Like 3 hours depending on how fast/aggressive you are. Computers have an annoying habbit of constantly jumping planets when they are almost dead. Real pain to finish them off. Also, much of the game is focusing on taking over planets with something called ""Doom Drops"" where you fly a ton of soldier ships and just crash them into the planet to take it over (no spaceship fighting.) Its not a bad mechanic, but it somewhat invalidates the awesome spaceship creations you make and the computer (due to micromanagement) is REALLY good/annoying with them.

I've probably put in around 20-30 hours now, and I must say I find this game really addicting. The user interface takes a little time to get used to, but once you get the hang of it, the game's dynamics are pretty fun. The game is technically turn based in a sense, but turns are measured by time (every 5 seconds) which you can alter during gameplay, or even pause to get your orders out first, so the game is actually played as if all in realtime. In ship combat, you basically just tell your ships to attack the bad guys, so if you like to manuever fleets and such this game may not be for you. You manage just about everything for your species, which is pretty neat. And of course, you design your ships if you want. It may be time consuming, but is pretty fun. You choose a hull type, and then you are responsible for setting up the rest. Also, when you create a new ship, don't name it the same as ships you already have in play, because then you won't be able to refit your current ships. All in all, I would give this game an 8.5 out of 10. It is fun, and as you keep progressing, you can't help but to want to stick around and see what comes next.

The game freezes, crashes, wierd buggyness, confusing as hell and is not polished in a lot of areas, but that all being said, its a lot of fun.Think a much slower and less refined civ game based in space. I dont want to compare it to the other space games. I put it on easy mode, researched everything explored every nook and such and still didnt understand some of the mechanics. Then i built several massive dreadnaut class capital warships with intertial dampeners, filled one with nukes and another with the best shields and weapons money could buy and just walked through everything. That was fun. I really wish the devs would take the time to really finish this game, build in the tooltips and not make it impractical to research and such.Ship building is awesome, its a bit much for me but if you really get into it, theres some crazy things you can do with it.Resource management is like any other civ game. Its a bit quirky but theres some nice differences to set it apart from the rest.The diplomacy stuff is meh, I was never good at dimplomacy but the 'tone' option you have on all responses really is a neat thing.The slowness is a good and bad thing, sometimes a speed adjustment would be nice, but other times I couldnt hit the pause button quick enough.Aside from any other unpolished based complaints, my big issue was with the notification system. My fleet could have gotten into a huge ambush or intercepted by the 'remnant' forces and I would have never known. It got me quite a bit of times and I'd never want it to be like civ which I think has notification overload but there needs to be more. I had a smaller map and its just too much to keep track of.I dont know the cost of the game now, its definitely worth checking out, I only spent like 8 bucks on the sale so that was worth it, but dont expect it to be the next MoO and if you dont know what that is, then thats good, just go with it.

It still feels like it's in dev because there's still enough bugs and patches that are needed but it's still playable. Sadly the game feels like there is so much more potential yet it hasn't or will not tap into.The game itself allows you to customize your own ships with a large variety of weapons, shields, armor, equipment, and whatnot. You can then make fleets of those ships and fight against other factions. The diplomacy in the game is better than what the civilization series has accomplished. You actually get rewarded quite well for being diplomatic instead of being completely warlike. Also the galaxy exploration is fun too. You can send out scouts looking for suitable planets for colonization and you can build your solar galaxy in between planets and can connect them with trade systems and territorial markers.I would highly recommend this game if you love sci-fi space battles and the civilization series."

You are also giving different ship frames where you can customize how it is armored and armed square by square. It's an interesting thing, but this leads to a few problems.Ship battles don't really have any sort of micromanagement, even smaller ships turn slowly. Ship AI is also lacking.  Also building new ship designs is also a timesink, especially when constantly researching new weapons.  This would be a huge problem in multiplayer.. which unfortunately there is none.The game is still getting updates, but it's hard to justify a fullpricetag.If it's on sale, it's is worth the time."

Eventually, all 4X games become compared to it.StarDrive has many positive aspects - friendly interface, interesting gameplay, starship constructor (in which alone, you'll spend hours, customizing your ships). But all-in-all, in my opinion, it failed to implement these into a balanced game. Notorious AI and ship movement, bugs, balancing issues, weak diplomacy. Abscence of a storyline is OK for me, neither MoO did have one, but StarDrive feels in every way incomplete. Short tech-tree, strategy flaws (you can win almost every game in minutes, by producing soldiers and landing them onto enemy homeworlds - no defence for that. Ka-pow! And the enemy is either extict, or thrown into a stone age.)Moreover - as of 1.15 patch, it seems that there'll be no more updates, as developer focused on a second installement. Some complained it was a hit-and-run move, but I sense logic there. No use of trying to sew together a Frenkenstein. It's far easier and wiser to start from scratch, avoiding mistakes learned. Looking forward to trying the second game out.My opinion - the game is worth trying out, although overpriced. But a good addition to a 4X collection when sold at a discount."

The lack of a nicely paced tutorial and some of the controls being not so intuitive (but once you learnt it, either by google or the game's wiki, it's not a problem no more) might put off some, but in my opinion, this game is a gem.A typical 4X turn-based game can more often than not turn into a flutter of clicks while you wait, or at times, there's just so much info and decisions to go through, that sometimes each turn can take a whole lot of time. The ""real-time"" concept in this game is a good balance. You can speed up, slow down and pause, in other words, you dictate the pacing of the game.Space battles are cool and there's quite a bit of getting used to here... meaning to say, there's some interesting tactics... like making your ships charge and come around at slower ships... allows a more maneuverable but less powerful ship to bring down a slower brute... or a swarm of light ships can do more damage to one or a few powerful capital class ships...Of course, there are things to be improved... research can be painstakingly slow, but perhaps it's because there are not that many things to research... or that it's one way to stretch the game, I don't know.

However, as I learned my way around the contrls and began combat, I realised how much fun this game can seriously get. The combat in this is tons and tons of fun, least of all because of the creative control you have on your ships. You get the blueprint of your ship, and then fill its insides with weapons, power, bridges, the lot. You then test your design out in combat. It has great visuals and beautiful weapon effects, all the races ships feel different and look cool. Its only downside is Empire building and the economy is pretty shallow.

You can assume manual control over your ""flagship"" but this is sort of useless; I find myself never making use of the ability.  That, coupled with the fact that there's a game type selector but no game type except the default, tells me that this game started with the intent to develop something akin to StarFlight or Star Control II, but that inability to manage scope led it to becoming just another Sins of a Solar Empire clone.That said, the AI is challenging, though it tends to make odd choices at times.   Unfortunately, the races are very predictable in behavior, and seem a bit like ripoffs themselves.   The Kulrathi warrior bear race reminds me a little much of the Kilrathi warrior cat race from old Wing Commander.   There's a race of squid-beings that have ships and philosophy very similar to the Reapers from Mass Effect.I did enjoy playing this game for one or two playthroughs, and the modification of the ships is an interesting mechanic, but I found myself going back to Sins of a Solar Empire to get this sort of fix.   Between the lack of creativity on the alien races and the clear false-start of creating an ""adventure"" mode, I was never able to shake the feeling that the game was completed halfway and the rest was just phoned in.

I've not found it as complex as the others, not turn based and for me, it's easing me into how 4x games essentially work.I can't say much about the negativity surrounding the game because I'm only new to the genre but as a game, I'm finding that it functions great so far.Graphically I can not complain, the music and sounds are nice. I'm sure as I play more, I'm going to find things I don't like and once I get used to the genre I'll start playing other 4x space games then look back on this and make comparisons but for now, this seems like a great entry level game to the genre."

The mechanics make sense, and the player can make informed choices to wring out advantages to actually win battles, wars, and the game. Custom ship designs are a key part of the value proposition of the game, and the implementation here is meaty and satisfying.Those good things said, the game has some big flaws in usability/playability. There is often only one way to perform an action  (scrap/refit a ship, scroll the map) when there should be several; information displays like the known-planets list and ships list are missing key features. Also, while the ship design module is a lot of fun early in the tech tree, as ships get larger the lack of any automated support makes filling in all the boxes of a design tedious instead of fun.I picked StarDrive up as part of the holiday sale, and I can say it was worth the discounted price to me, but I'm not sure it would be worth full price."

There is nothing more satisfying than having your custom badass capitalship send out a swarm of your custom fighters and totaly anhialate an enemy fleet.Compared to a lot of other 4X games, Stardrive does not have as big of a techtree, there is still plenty of things to research but compared to games like Endless Space it's far from enough. One thing I really miss is more ways to improve your planets and concidering all the buildingspace you have left, there is room for a lot more.Pros:- Short learning curve- Deep shipdesign- Real-time gameplay- AddictingCons:- Not enough to research- Ground battles- Game crash after a few hours of play- Save files are way to big"

It reminded me of the old Stars! game for Windows 3.1, where you would define your alien race, expand, conquere, research and design new ship layouts.  It sounded like a great modern update.  But after playing for a while, expanding a lot, and making a large fleet, I tried to attack a small faction and lost for no good reason.  It feels like there's a ""correct"" way to play this game and they never tell you anything about how to play it.  For instance, to conquer a planet, you have to take out the ships guarding it, and then send colonists over in separate transport ships to fight on the ground, which is heavily favoured to the defender.  You have to outnumber them like 10-1 to have a hope of taking the place.  So after spending an untold effort in trying to take ONE planet from a small faction, my faction gets into a civil war and my homeworld gets heavily attacked, at which point I lost all interest in this game.The mechanics are clunky and not at all expained.  To top it off, it seem like a lot of features where left unfinished in favour of working on the sequel, so overall, I would say avoid.
