,Recommended,220740,32774829,Posted: 25 June,all,IMuthaTuckerI,"Great game, the first one was better though. Looking forward to playing the 3rd one soon. One thing that I found hilarious wasThe ""Lost"" series implementation with Hurley's infamous lottery numbers 4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42. Brought a great nostalgic chuckleHowever, there was two things that really grinded my gears on this one. The first one beinghow in order to get into the resistance clubhouse, you had to turn down the actual music volume in the main menu options.How exactly is anyone supposed to figure that out without glancing at a walkthrough? I enjoy clever puzzles, but that was just too farfetched of an idea. I was searching everywhere for a solution, and was absolutely furious when I had to resort to a guide for the first time for something so silly.The second one was simply a glitch, but yet again♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off that I had to use a guide again to solve it (I hate using walkthroughs for puzzle games). The part whereYou have to place the transmitter on the radio tower. I had already figured out what needed to be done without talking to Goal, so I had already placed the pool down and filled it, gave her the umbrella, and put the tree air fresheners on it. Then, when trying to hand her the lotto ticket, Rufus will say ""hmm...that still needs work."" So in order for her to take the bloody thing, I had to ask her to move out of the pool, and just ask her the steps to a thunderstorm. She finally took it after finishing all dialogues and moving her back into the pool.I just thought that was kinda dumb that I had to trigger the dialogue in order to complete that part. Again, that had me stumped for almost an hour just trying to figure out what went wrong.So, other than those two absolutely ridiculous situations, the game was fun."

Nice humor, interesting story, great puzzles, unique characters, hours of fun!Overview: Chaos on Deponia is the second game in the adventure, point-and-click trilogy made by Daedelic. You control Rufus, a self-centered jerk who, more than anything, hates Deponia - some kind of a junkyard planet - and wishes to go to Elysium.Well, if you played the previous game,you know now he wants to save Deponia, too.The result is a game full of comedy, awkward moments packed with fun, and even romance.Pros:The interface is really great and easy to navigateThe story is interesting, packed with good quality humor, and you'll probably have lots of fun in the wayGood length for an adventure gameThe puzzles are really nice and sober--the game provides you not-too-obvious hints when you interact with the world and they've really hit the perfect mark in this aspect. Also, if you need additional in-game help, you can press space to see the hotspots, which is always good as an option. You probably won't need a guide, if you can deal with just the right amount of frustration that pushes you forward.Characters are really cool and fun. The main character is embarrassingly annoying, but that allows for some ""role play"", you can say, when you try to think like he would as you try to solve the puzzles.Great voice actingThe 2D graphics are really amazingThe BGM is really awesome--specially the Huzzah songsThe cliffhanger for the next game is just perfect--it closes a chapter really well, but you'll want to know what happens nextCons:The game crashed a few times for me (probably 2 or 3), mostly after videos. But according to my experience, it never happens if you skip the Daedelic intro.I can't say it's a huge con, but the pacing of the game is a bit weird for me. At the beginning, you're thrown in a huge area to explore and you have to deal with a lot of tasks. After that, the game becomes a lot more linear. Seems like they rushed to finish the game a little bit.Bought on: Steam Store for R$ 4,99 (US$ 3.99 on the US store at the same time). If you don't have any of the games in the trilogy and think this game is for you, it might be a better idea to buyThe Complete Journey(the full trilogy) instead.Verdict: If you're a fan of adventures and point-and-clicks, you most definitely have to check the Deponia series! It's precious. I'm not easy to please when it comes to humor and comedy, but Deponia just manages to do it better than all other games I've played (well, maybe except for Sam & Max, imnsho). Also, like I've said, the puzzles are really smart, the story is interesting, characters are unique, and basically everything you need in an adventure game is there. Don't miss it! But make sure you start with Deponia--don't skip to Chaos on Deponia, it won't make much sense."
,Not Recommended,220740,13682594,"Posted: 28 December, 2014",all,Realityhack,"Despite giving the firstDeponiagame a tentative ""thumbs up"" I simply cannot recommend the second game in the trilogy.Chaos on Deponiacould easily have been removed from the trilogy since it does almost nothing to further the plot of the series. It features some incredibly obtuse puzzles, and a huge number of locations to explore straight from the beginning, making it confusing to know where you should be going and what you should be doing.My main gripe with all the Deponia games (outside of theterrifically unlikablemain character, Rufus) is the gratuitous amount of completely pointless, filler dialogue you have to slog through just to complete simple tasks. Nearly every character you meet will supply you with 6+ dialogue options which will each spawn at least 15 lines of completely inane banter that does absolutely nothing to further the story or even provide mild entertainment. Thisisn'tquality dialogue, like in olderLucasArtsgames, where you actuallywantto click every option. Even if you ignore most of the extraneous dialogue options, often just trying to accomplish tasks will result in Rufus droning on and on and on with his signature, humorless commentary. It doesn't help that his voice is about as fun to listen to as a nursery full of teething babies with diaper rash. By the end of the game I was skipping through most of the dialogue since it added zero value to the story.The only real point to playChaos on Deponiais if you already own the trilogy and want to play the games in order. If not, don't bother and instead pick up an adventure game that's actually good, like one of the Special EditionMonkey Islandgames (which, despite people's insistence on comparing them to the Deponia series, are actually nothing alike, apart from sharing a genre - and that's a good thing)."

What makes this game so good is the fact that they stay true to the style of the game, but are able to add enough layers to make it a great game on its own. It was another opening scene that grabbed my attention (getting the hammer). I was back on another crazy adventure with Ruuuuufus. The witty humor, amazing storyline, new great tunes, and the ever so amazing puzzles make for hours of enjoyment. To expound a bit more, the humor brought in funny stuff from the first game, but always had a fresh twist to it. The story was the same way. If you have watched the trailers you know that Rufus is trying to get off Deponia, but the way the story was written, you hardly remember that is the goal. I never felt like the game was trying to outdo the first one.

I found that too many situations required that special brand of adventure game guesswork – combining random objects, doing random things, or exhausting every single possible line of dialogue with every single character, just in the hope that the game would point me in the right direction. And don’t get me started on that one meta-puzzle – I should not ever have to go into a game’s options menu to solve a puzzle! In the end, I must have had to hit up a walkthrough on at least a half-dozen occasions, which is a half-dozen too many in my book.All in all, it’s not bad, but unless you enjoyed Deponia enough that you want to see how the character’s stories evolve, I wouldn’t bother."

This game doesn’t kid around. The tone is more serious, and in some regards, darker: you are required to commit murder and animal abuse, just to name two of the morally questionable mandatory actions.The story puts a larger emphasis on Rufus and his interaction with Goal (or Goals, since she is three people now) and the other characters. This not only portrays his selfish personality, but also evolves it in a quite realistic way. The dialogues are, without doubt, the greatest strength of the game.The plot… not that much. The central issue of the planet’s destruction is shoved into the background to lead you in some wild goose chases. And when the story arc finally remembers it should lead somewhere, it suddenly abandons several smaller threads without explanation.Progressing can sometimes be a gargantuan task with intricate, several-step, whole gameworld-spanning puzzles based on typical adventure game logic. (How do you win at rock-paper-scissors? By destroying a pair of sunglasses to gain entrance to a submarine, of course!) The minigames are more forgiving, thankfully.Despite these setbacks, Chaos on Deponia is the highlight of the trilogy, and one of the best Daedalic games– worthy to be in the library of any point ’n’ click fan."

,Recommended,220740,30974568,Posted: 6 April,all,Informal Informant,"NOTE: This is the same review for the other two games in the original Deponia trillogy aswell. I thought that as they are a continuation of the same story that they should stay together.What the game isTheDepnoniatrillogy is a classic point and click game on a wold filled with garbage. In the trillogy, you assist the, at first forgettable/dislikeable, protagonist Rufus try to reach the floating paradise of Elysium. Over time, the originally forgettable Rufus uses his witty dialog to slowly get you on his side rooting for him on his quest.Pros+Amazing storyThe story, although only really played out during cut scenes to new areas, is deep in detail. It pulls you in, really pulling you into the world.+FunnyNot many games have blaitently funny dialog, but these games definatly do. Rufus has funny responses to other characters, his own acvtions, and stuff you try to have him do.+CharactersAll the characters seem fleshed out quite well. Each has a uniques personallity, displayes different emotions, and just act different. The variety is also pretty good.+EnviromentsMost enviroments are well detailed with other people and objects to bring the scene alive. In some cases, youll get people who are from other games showing up in the envirments aswell.+MusicThe music worked well with each area you would be exploring. Although mostly being simmilar themed, it all was different and interesting.Cons-Animations/MovementThe walking animation on Rufus, for me was a bit weird. He didnt really face where he was going and took odd paths to where he needed to go.-DurationSome areas seemed too short, while others were too long. It was an odd thing and may have just been the way I solved the puzzles in each area, but it struck me as odd how I could clear one area in ~30 min and another in 2+ hours.Final OpinionTheDeponiatrillogy is an amazing set of games that brought back tthe nastolga of point and the point and click style. The quirky dialog was fun to hear and laugh at resonces. The story makes the narcissistic Rufus someone whos actions have you rootingor cyingfor the duration of his adventure. If you have some time free I can highly reccomend all the games in theDeponiatrillogy andDeponia Doomsday."

,Not Recommended,220740,12858439,"Posted: 9 November, 2014",all,ollietl,"Buyer beware!Chaos on Deponia is a great game in a great series but it has been broken by its developers.I got halfway through it and then they released a patch which rendered all previous save games unplayable (random speech in a foreign language would play in a constant loop wherever you go). This was in 2013. Despite numerous, highly-populated threads on the Steam forums, Daedalic never fixed the bug.So eventually I started the game again, played all the way from the beginning back to where I left off, and started making progress again. Then, I don't know, but they must have released another patch. As of now, the game will boot up but it will crash whenever you try to start or continue from the main menu. Not even completely uninstalling and downloading again has fixed this problem.The only conclusion which can come from all of this is that Daedalic are fantastic game makers who are absolute imbeciles when it comes to the technical details of releasing and supporting their product. I've played Deponia 1 and half of 2, and I bought Deponia 3 in anticipation of completing the story. If you can get them to actually run then you will have a blast - all those other positive reviews are right on the money.

,Recommended,220740,11447162,"Posted: 28 July, 2014",all,Comrade St. Nikolai,"""Reckoning up the sum, the best was yet to come, for the end of part one seemed a little too coarse. To amend we'll send Rufus to attend a second chance for a decent happy-ending: a grand fling with dancing and booze and so forth...""To put it simply, if you liked Deponia, you'll certainly like Chaos on Deponia. Part of that's because it has just as much quality in its art, characters, story, music, puzzles, etc. The other part is because it more or less follows the same motions. Rufus solves an enclosed introductory puzzle, then builds a contraption involving rockets to launch himself into the sky, winds up crashing into a vehicle which contains Goal, both plummet to Deponia, you solve a handful of major problems by solving a ton of smaller ones in a large town area, then a smaller transitional act, and finally the twisty confrontation.And yet, despite featuring the same framework, the body is all-new. New faces, new locations, new puzzles. There's much to do and explore. So much of the world of Deponia to learn about, and a diverse and creative cast of characters to meet, all weird in their own ways.And oh my god, the voices are so much better. I mean, the majority of Deponia's voices weren't a problem, but the Organon's certainly were. Luckily, though the voices still have the same electronic filter, the volume has been turned down from ""standing beside a malfunctioning stage woofer"" to ""playing on a rusty seesaw"". I never liked Goal or Toni's voices much in Deponia, either, but unless I'm less of a cranky old voice snob than I used to be (unlikely - I'll be a voice snob 'til the very end!), the actresses have gotten a better hang of their characters, this time around. Goal, in particular, I thought sounded very nice. And she'd have to, considering the actress now had to keep up with three or four variations of the character (each of which sounds distinct, but intentionally similar enough to be the same character). Rufus does sometimes have lines that are delivered in ways that don't seem to match the situation at hand, and I definitely caught a flubbed line here or there (which the subtitles at least got right), but even still, his V.A. does a fine job with the other 98% of his lines.Weird translation problems do crop up from time to time, and they can have varying impacts. Chaos on Deponia was made by a German team, and it seems a little obvious here and there. For the mostpart it doesn't matter at all. On the whole, the English version of Chaos on Deponia shows an expansive understanding of the language. But there are some lines that just didn't make it through unscathed (at one point, a character asks, ""What? I'm pardoned?"" when he's supposed to say, ""What?He'spardoned?""), and some jokes seem weird in ways that suggest that they worked a lot better in their original language.On that note, I also want to mention that Poki's folky narrative songs are more... chaotic, this time around. Maybe that was a thematic choice, based on the title. But I'll be honest, those songs were one of my absolute favorite parts of Deponia. With maybe the exception of the third song, in this game they're much harder to follow. If it weren't for the subtitles, I wouldn't have a clue what he's saying half the time, with odd rhymes, lines with way too many words, and lines that end in the middles of words. I suppose this adds to the zaniness in a way, but I still preferred the old ones better.The puzzles are more imaginative than I had expected, even having played the first game. Where Deponia featured a borderline obsessive number of puzzles centered around washing things, the devs have put forth a much stronger effort to keep you one your toes, this time. There are some dips into moon logic territory, but even those are more to do with the problem presented (such as as a head-sized human nose sticking out of a wall as a security device), or with how extravagant the means to solving them are (the lengths Rufus goes to in order to recognize a cat door are astounding, and perhaps a little unfortunate depending on your affinity for cartoon wildlife), and maybe one or two where I wasn't sure what I was accomplishing until I had already accomplished it (ding-dong ditch comes to mind), rather than just a straight-up complete and utter lack of logic. Several puzzles are downright ingenious, though. One puzzle involving a secret knock is about as weirdly outside-the-box as it gets, and I love it in all of its fourth wall-breaking splendor.Daedalus has struck a good balance in the difficulty. It's not as though I never got stuck. I did. In fact, I got stuck on the follow-up to that knocking puzzle simply due to a confusing sound effect. You have multiple secrets knocks which, though they should all sound different, all use the same sound effect, which made it tough to figure out how I was meant to go about solving the problem. But the vast majority of them were a joy to solve, with the game giving you just the right amount of clues necessary to understand what you're doing, without being so simplistic as to make you feel like a toddler. And there are a number of segments which take chances and break out of the typical talk to people/use items mold. You'll play an interesting take on a fighting game, compete in the weirdest form of rock-paper-scissors that I have ever seen, and take advantage of a complicated loophole in fast food pricing, among other highlights.The puzzles are good, I like the puzzles. They're not 100% perfect but they're like 80-90% perfect. Boom, could have saved you two paragraphs of your time if I'd just written that first.I said it about Deponia, and I'll say it again about Chaos on Deponia: the game feels like a true evolution of the old SCUMM-based Lucasarts games. Not a copy, nor even an homage. But something which could have naturally formed from Lucasarts themselves in an alternate timeline. I mean this as a great compliment. If you can stand some translational oddities, you'll find that Chaos on Deponia is a beautiful - albeit junk-strewn - world filled with strange people and creative solutions for even more creative problems. I can easily recommend picking it up. Though I of course recommend picking up Deponia, first, if you haven't. Or the recently released Complete Journey which collects the whole trilogy. If you're a fan of silly, imaginative adventures like Day of the Tentacle or cartoony ones like Curse of Monkey Island, you're in for a treat with these.""HUZZAH, PUT BALLS TO THE WALL!"""

The humor is predictable and the actual game seems less important on the developer's priorities than the bad jokes about the protagonist.I simply couldn't continue playing after the scene with the robotic dog because the writing was that bad.  The same voice recordings were recycled too many times throughout the dialogue and the puzzle was severly disappointing.  My favorite parts of the first game were the unconventional and devious puzzle solutions that weren't immediately obvious and helped me to relate to the character of Rufus.  This scene alone destroyed that as the solution to the puzzle was yet another joke about his inhuman stupidity.  Rufus went from a likable trickster to a complete clown who cannot hope to be passed off as a realistic character.This is very disappointing, as the world in which Deponia is set has the potential for a great experience and I was genuinely interested in where the story would go in this game.  Now I have no motivation to play any further because I just don't want to see whether the writing could possibly get any worse.In addition to the poor writing, this game also seems to have worse voice acting than the first and the animation just feels lazy.  The latter of these complaints was also a problem in the first Deponia game, but I was willing to overlook that for a well-made game overall with good art and effort put into other places.  Since this game obviously doesn't have the second part, the lack of believable animations only adds to my disappointment.  It's unfortunate that I will not be able to enjoy Deponia's wonderful art because of the horrible design of the game.I really have to wonder what this game's target audience is.  The humor is too banal and predictable to be enjoyed by an adult but the puzzles are too difficult to be figured out by a child.  I was under the impression that the first game was targeted to adults but I have trouble beleiving that could be true considering how immature this one is.My advice is that you do not invest in the Deponia series, as this really isn't worth anyone's time.  If you don't believe me, you should be able to come to an agreement quickly enough to still be eligible for a refund.  While the first game was a good experience for a $2 game on sale, this is overpriced even at its current $3."

To put things differently, Chaos on Deponia is wildly inconsistent but wildly enjoyable... for the most part.In my review for Deponia, I referred to a few puzzles being of the Sierra Online variety. Kudos to the developers for actually refererring to those particular games via a pop-up. Boos and hisses to the developers for deviating from -- what I felt -- a strong LucasArts feel and going a bit more Sierra. Hopefully the third game swings the pendulum back the other way."

Daedalic decided to start this sequel in a way which left me feeling uneasy throughout the rest of the game(I really tried EVERYTHING! Please forgive me, John Thomas!)This part introduces so many new concepts and gives vast space for sophisticated character development. A pity that the protagonist decides NOT to learn anything from his experiences. But in all honesty, I can't imagine Rufus-da-dufus being a mature adult, so I guess he just grows in his own emotionally disconnected and reality-twisting way.But as much as I have trouble relating to the main character because of our issues (more often than not, I just want to slap him Tyrion-style), I do love me some ubiquitous innuendos.

It's still hilarious, still fun and it still has a good story. There were two problems, in my opinion:1. The puzzles were sometimes too obscure. While this game certainly improved on some aspects of the first game (most of the time I actually had some idea of what I was doing, and some sense of progress, whereas in the first one I tended to get stuck much more often) - it still suffers a bit from being a littletoohard in places. I'm not saying that I want it to be easy - no thanks - but this game is so big and sprawling that it sometimes got very confusing as to where I needed to go next. (on the other hand, it did improve quite a lot on the first game. Some new mechanics were pretty good).2. Parts of it do feel a bit like filler. The actual story part of the game is extremely stretched out (you spend the majority of the game trying to convince all three goals to agree to have surgery. Basically the whole of the Black Market was devoted to this one puzzle, and it's a big place). It was fun, but it was slow going. It set up a lot of important stuff for the third game, obviously, but not a lot happened in this one compared to the others.But, still, it was a good game, like the others. I love this universe, the characters, the humour. In this game, it was especially the humour, being a bit more lacking in story and character development than the others.Overall, it was fun, and important as a setup for the third one, which I think is easily the best. Obviously, if you're playing the trilogy, youcan'tmiss this one - you probably won't even be reading the reviews for the second game if you've played the first - even so, I'm going to give it an 8/10 for anyone who might be reading."

The real focus has always been the comic side, usually using sarcastic answers as a way to pass the mood. Since the offenses despite the way it is interpreted by the situation itself, end up becoming something funny that also serves as a way to take the possible tension of the situation. Chaos on Deponia game is a point and click adventure genre mixed with humor and a moderate dose of puzzles, created and distributed by Daedalic Entertainment.Its main objective is to save Deponia ( ""Deponie"" means ""landfill"" in German), known as the planet trash that which Rufus, the main character, wants much to see far and try numerous times to escape, until one of those times Rufus eventually you find goal and is exactly at this point that that his personal goal ends up becoming a much bigger goal. What Rufus ever wanted was to leave this place and go to Elysium (This is the word, by the way, used to designate a paradise by the ancient Greeks), and this time the situation comes fully expected, perhaps more than usual to be precise, and gets involved in an accident which ends up passed out across Goal. As I had said what was particular goal has grown and developed in a way that soon Rufus was seeing on a mission to save Deponia from total destruction.In the first version of the game it happened in the small town of Kuvaq and its development is now happening in the Black Market Floating Red Sea Rust, with more characters to interact and more local exploitable.About Goal, she barely had a share in the previous game however this time the game almost revolves around her and their personalities, which were fragmented by a new drop caused by Rufus. Thus by means of a remote control can change between 3 figures, each with unique situations and dialogue:- Lady Goal, intelligent, educated and snobbish.- Spunky Goal, aggressive and rude.- Baby Goal, naive and childish.The visual cartoonized the game is really lovely however the colors are less vivid than the first, it serves to pass the climate change. The game has a more tense atmosphere, the beautiful Kuvaq garbage mountains now give way to scenarios that much convey the feeling of decadence in which the planet is but the beginning seemed to be denied or perhaps a lack of acceptance of truth.Things that caught my attention in particular:- Visual landscape quality and the level of detail- Each character has unique personalities and are well explored, both by their attitudes as the dialogues.- The moments ""musical"" excel the songs of the game.To conclude, I believe that this is a great acquisition, but obviously I do not mean only this title after all this is a continuity and a real experience is required to play from Deponia to Goodbye Deponia.

I've found this game to be more difficult than the first because at some point in the game you'll be given the freedom to travel to different places instead of being stuck in one place, which adds a whole new dimension of difficulty to the puzzle mechanics. Although there are some iffy moments where I was forced to refer to a walkthrough for help because some of the solutions are just too out-of-the-box, the additional challenge adds a certain charm to the game and it definitely keeps me entertained enough to play through the whole game in one day. The story is still great and I do feel that there are definitely more interesting dialogues between MC and the people around him.This game has earned a solid recommendation from me to anyone who has played the first game and enjoyed it, and if you haven't, then I'd also recommend the first game to those looking for good puzzles and good story in a game."

However, despite these flaws, I did enjoy the game and so I couldn't resist continuing on to the next chapter. I much preferred the puzzles in this chapter, although I'm not sure if it's because I was now used to the way the game ""thinks"" and thus found it easier.I liked many of the game mechanics and was able to play most of the game without any walkthrough. Again, however, some of the puzzles were quite obscure, or just out of reach so that when I did look up the solution, I either thought ""What? How was I supposed to figure that out?"" or ""Argh, I basically did that!"". Still, I appreciated a lot of the scenes and in particular the different places to explore.The humour is still great, and some of the new characters added some depth to familiar scenarios. As with the first instalment, I still think there was too much dialogue in some places. I also still have major issues with the representation of the female characters in this game, in particular the way Goal is objectified not just by Rufus's creepy possessive pursuit of her as a prize or trophy, but also in the game mechanics. There are also a couple of cutscenes that were just unnecessarily vulgar and borderline predatory. Goal is a great character, and I love the additional dynamism her character got in this chapter, which made it even more of a shame to see her remain as an object to be ogled and played with. Blech.Overall, it's still a good game, though I wouldn't pay full price for it. I got both Deponia and Chaos on Deponia in the sale and I'm very happy about that. I wouldn't pay more than €10/$10 for either chapter. If you can get the whole lot on sale, even better."

Yes he is still annoying, but I don't think he is quite as bad as he was in the original Deponia. Gameplay wise, things are pretty much the same as the original, but there have been a few added twists here and there that make things more fun.The main wrinkle to things this time around is that Goal has three personalities now, and you can choose between each one, so if one of them refuses to do something, another may might react completely differently. Most of the puzzles are not too outrageous (a couple however are very “out of the box”) but there are occasions where you are doing the correct thing, just not at the right time, so you assume that is not the solution to the problem and move on (except it IS the solution)  Really, for most of the time you have a feeling that you know what you need to do, it's just figuring out how to actually DO it is the annoying part.Better than the original in every way, if you want to keep up with Rufus and company, give this a go. If you hated things about the original Deponia, this installment will not change your mind."

The cartoon style graphics are very cool to me and I enjoy the animation of the characters as their stories unfold. Character wise it is rare to see an underdog like Rufus who is so flawed be so lovedable at the same time.

But also like previous game it contains a lot of bugs, most of which are the same as in the original Deponia. They are not game breaking (though some Steam achievements do not work), but it really saddens me to see that Daedalic still doesn't care to fix them.Overall it is fun game but besides game bugs it contains some other drawbacks. It is really short and ends abruptly only to tell you to wait for the third part to see the end of the story.

I wonder what will happen in the third game...The story is still continuing like it was in the first game - Rufus *trying to escape Deponia (*note the trying).  The plot does have some parts that are confusing and annoying like Rufus buying the bad type of cartridges for Goal's brain and then it's split into 3 parts and then he has to seduce every part of Goal to proceed with the story (uugghh... come on). Maybe the story is being stretched too long??The second part of the series has more difficult minigames and you can't even skip some.. I had troubles with the Platypys Bataka (couldn't see where Goal was looking), but after a series of serious ragequits I got past that and continued on with the story.Overall the game is quite fun and interesting.

The city you spend most of your time in is nice, lots of scenery, people to talk to, etc. But I found it quite easy to get stuck and remain stuck. Some of the puzzles just don't make a whole lot of sense without the walkthrough. For example: you cannot get to one part of the map without a bowl of peanuts that you shove into a mechanical nose. Sense made? Me neither. Worse, you spend the vast majority of the game in THAT CITY. Hardly anywhere else. That makes for a VERY slow game. Overall this is the slowest game of the series.As if Rufus couldn't be more of a selfish dirtbag, the plotpoint of the first part of the game basically just cements the parts of his character I do not like: his complete selfishness and idiocy. Who gets the cheaper supplies and the lolly when it's a matter of restoring someone with the equivalence of brain damage to good health? Ugh.

Especially after playing The Night of the Rabbit, though, I felt particularly put off by Rufus's character more than anything else. It feels like so much ""bumbling idiot nevertheless gets the hot chick"" trope, except Rufus is if Guybrush Threepwood had a LOT more misogyny... not to mention the (otherwise interesting) core gimmick of //nonconsensually// remote-controlling Goal (which seems like a flagrant ""Woman as Trophy"" name there). I'd feel better if it turns out she's fully a robot/cyborg vs. a woman with a brain implant for what reason, but I haven't looked up spoilers to find out without playing part 3. What Goal sees in Rufus despite her awareness of how terrible a person he is doesn't make sense--sort of caring about Deponia not getting exploded + wanting all of her back together vs. splintered doesn't = great relationship material worth forgiving the physical violence he's brought upon her (ESPECIALLY when he totally meant to do it).What bothers me is this is otherwise a great game in terms of art (adorablest kitties!) and execution. The puzzles are a bit... forced, though--I'd be fine with fourth-wall-breaking *optional* puzzles, or if the story centered around fourth-wall-breaking, but I find it jarring to [light spoiler] have to exit gameplay to solve a central puzzle [/light spoiler], and I know the ""humour"" of the series is slapsticky, but it's frustrating basically having to be a bad guy to be the good guy (killing multiple animals as a ""joke"" puzzle solution).Yeah, I know nobody really reads these reviews, but I found my experience strongly disagreeable! I could honestly only reverse my ""not recommend"" if you get this super cheap and/or you want to support Daedalic making stuff (hopefully more like The Night of the Rabbit).tl;dr version: At least Rufus isn't Sadwick, but The Whispered World's cutscenes were more amazing?"

This is the weakest episode in the series.  If you played and enjoyed the first game, you will enjoy this one.  If not, you can stop here and not bother continuing.  If you are starting the series fresh you should pick up the first one.As a part of Daedalic's Monkey Island-like humor series, the jokes are in there, and they are numerous.  Again, I can't say anything here is any better than the other two games.  Translation problems factor in and some of the humor will leave you confused, as it did in the other two games.  Some of the humor is unintentional because of the aforesaid translation.  Some of them, a few of the less funny sexist jokes, the Scandinavian guy, that part where you ----- -- baby dolphins ---- ----, did not leave me insulted so much as wondering how the writers could have believed I would think that funny.  Perhaps this is just me not entirely getting the German sense of humor or me just calling out tasteless as I see it.The pace of the story has slowed down a lot.  A large chunk of the game involves character development for Goal.  Rufus changes little from the first game and any hopes  you may have that he is really a decent person are taken outside and shot several times.  Any character development he receives follows the direction of writer's butt monkey and someone the player wishes something bad would happen to.  Fortunately, you do become attached to the colorful cast of side characters and part of the enjoyment of playing the game involves seeing who's life Rufus will ruin next.The gameplay shows Daedalic's polish to the adventure gaming genre which leave you wondering why nobody else tried some of the changes they made.  As an example, the inventory can be brought up and down with a hotkey on your mouse wheel.  Details are well drawn and animated, with your attention going to things you should pay attention to so you don't have to do the mouse search across a background for that one object.  There are keyboard shortcuts and a highlight button to show all the intractable objects.  Things like this keep me playing Daedalic's games even through parts I don't enjoy.The puzzles are more complicated than they were in the first game.  If you don't like being in an area with a large bloated zone with several puzzles dropped in your lap at the same time, working on all of them at the same time, that is the entire first - and largest - part of the game.  Nothing drove me to frustration and any problems could be solved by thinking about them for a while, but there is a large area to cover and a lot of things to tinker with in order to figure out what you need to do.There are a few stand out moments, the first puzzle you solve, teaching you how to apply several gameplay basics, after you go through the basic tutorial was hilarious.  Hilarious enough for me to restart and replay it a few times.  The second moment was when I had to go and change the game's options to solve a puzzle.Your mileage may vary for a lot of this game but I'd still call it the weakest episode in the series where Daedalic tries to correct some of the problems made in Deponia and end up creating new mistakes.  If you are not into Daedalic's adventure games or adventure gaming in general this is one you can skip.  If you are into the Deponia series and really enjoyed the first game enough to continue the story then, by all means, pick this one up."

Much of the interesting ideas the series presents have been explored, the characters have grown, the world is saved and there's a bittersweet note that provides some great texture and complexity.But mostly, it's the main character Rufus.  Throughout the first game he becomes more and more insufferable.  It's endearing at first, but near the end it starts to become exhausting.  By the start of this sequel, he gets to the point of being completely intolerable.  He abandons any growth he might have attained in the first game, and devolves to even more of a jackaninny than he ever was.  While it's obvious they're trying to channel Guybrush Threepwood, it crosses some hard to define line at some point where it's just not funny anymore.  Perhaps it's when he causes even more irreversable brain damage to the woman he claims to love (in addition to the damage he'd done previously) for a lollypop."
76561198010159516,Not Recommended,220740,9920299,"Posted: 24 April, 2014",all,Bear Hunter,"Chaos on Deponia (unfortunately) still follows Rufus - my most hated main character in any game series - treading unnecessary grounds between the series' first and third instalment. The plot this time around is more or less exactly the same as in Deponia: Rufus attempts to get to Elysium, hurts Goal in the process, saves Goal, then they both arrive at some sort of 'emotional finale'. The only actual tie-in with the overall story is the ridiculously unlikely romance between the two leads. There was plenty of opportunities to allow for some character development to take place here, but the developers must have thought Rufus is perfect the way he is. I doubt I am alone in thinking otherwise.The comedy found within is more miss than hit, usually revolving around racial and gender stereotypes, slapstick, and Rufus' narcissism. Characters you meet are one-dimensional walking punchlines, only they lack actual punchlines. Often, Rufus will be painted in a good light while characters opposing him - specifically women - are seen as ♥♥♥♥♥y obstructions in a great man's journey. When that fails, crude humour comes into play in the form of dead baby animals and belittling of others. I picture the developers staring longingly through the windows of residence Monkey Island, soaking in the rain while contemplating ringing the door bell and asking for worthwhile ideas. A shame they instead resorted to the trash bin.That being said, if you are a fan of point-and-click games, you should definitely consider giving it a shot. The gameplay is good fun, the art is gorgeous, and the English voice actors usually play their roles very well. The enjoyable musical numbers separating chapters are still present, but it's now even more painfully obvious they struggled to fit the lyrics to the songs. Sadly, all of this is not enough to warrant anything other than a red thumb.In summary: If you find it appealing to control the bane of human existence sort of bumble from one mildly logical puzzle to the next while listening to him comment on his surrounds with punchable smugness for 8-9 hours, then by all means give this a try.

(Edna & Harvey: The Breakout comes to mind for the latter one)Sometimes you never know if you're unable to progress due to a bug that prevents certain items going into the inventory, or if it's just a horrible case of Guide-Dang-It.Rufus is 100% just someone's failed attempt at making their own lovable Guybrush Threepwood clone and failed miserably. Instead of being a loveable rapscallion he comes off as an annoying know-it-all jerk & idiotic kleptomaniac.This is evident by the occasional Monkey Island references they throw into their games.The music for the series gets TERRIBLY ANNOYING after the first couple of minutes of hearing it.TONS of animal cruelty. TONS! :CThe coding gets pretty sloppy in certain areas, like getting the new secret knock code and the new knock plays at the same time as the person giving it to you saying something. Also choppy audio files with abrupt starts and finishes breaks the immersion.---Some of the jokes are pretty funny though.

Well, you even have to turn off the XXXX XXXXX for solve a puzzle!!! XDIn part 2 you learn more about Elysium and why it exist. Goal is engaged with a guy called Cletus which kinda looks like Rufus.

There were many areas to explore. There was a good sense of progression. Maybe, there were a few puzzles in there that were a tad too cryptic, but you know, it was a memorable game simply because of how it all felt when it was over.Choas on Deponia is memorable for the same reason, but this time, it doesn't feel good.It feels painful.Excrutiatingly painful.The first part of this game takes place within a large port-town that is, admittadely well-drawn and beautiful to look at, but yet again, large. Huge. Just right off the bat, you're forced to just figure things out, and that's alright in a game that's designed better, but here, anything and everything could be the ONE object you're supposed to interact with. That's just a bit too much to deal with, esspecially when the objects blend in with the background.So this one part here at the beginning sounds, you know, pretty annoying, but at LEAST it's short, right?No.I swear, this first part of the game goes on for at least four to five hours. Four to five hours of just pixel-clicking things to see if they do anything, walking, looking around, scratching your head, and going on GameFAQs.I don't remember the first game being like that. I remember it being fun and fair, not this overly-slow, cryptic trudge through samey diners, alleys, and laboratories.And what happened to Rufus? I thought he went through a huge character arc in the last one, learning his overt flaws and blatant vulerabilities? Wasn't there this big thing about how he actually was his enemy's greatest admirer only proving his rapid insults to be numbing hypocrisies, almost like he was subtley deconstructing his own personality indirectly? I thought the whole point of him ""acting"" cool was only to bottle up his true feelings of inferiority to the upper-class Elysiums that he so wanted to be a part of? It was only until the end where he realized that a change is needed for him to be in the right. He realized that the person he should be admiring the entire time should actually be the everyday, caring people that he surrounds himself with, including his own true love which he is determined to find once more and correct himself in her eyes. It will only be then when he can live without the shadow of his own pathetic whining ego crying in the deepest recesses of his mi-PFFFFFFFT. NAH.

Comming right out of the gate of Deponia, I jumped into this game. I expected the game to  just continue with it's humor and story. I had been expecting the difficulty of the game to stay the same. This time around there were more puzzles. They started out easy until I got to about the 2 chapter. I found the whole hatching eggs quest to be complete nonsense and super difficult with little hints. It wasn't until about 2 hours of being stumped that I relized that the game had a button for showing all the intactable items. This helped a little, but not a lot. Soon I found myself stuck again with no hints to point me in the right direction. I had to use a wlakthrough for a good portion of the game.(I'm prolly just missing something).As for the sotry, I found it to be quite intertaining at first, but then it gets slow and repetitive(Chapter 2). Anything after chapter 2 is quite interesting. I found the comedy this time around to be more forced than funny.

Let me just give a quick summary:The game takes place in Silentia, a dream fantasy world of a young, sad circus clown named Sadwick. The story starts as he wakes up in his travelling circus trailer after having experienced a recurring nightmare, where he sees the world falling apart.Sadwick wanders off to a nearby forest and meets Bobby, a Chaski, messenger of the King. Bobby is heading to Corona, the royal floating castle, to deliver a powerful artefact, the Whispering Stone, to the king. He claims the end of the world is near and that the land is already breaking apart and the Asgil, a hideous horde of underground creatures, are surrounding Corona. He tells Sadwick he has been unsuccessfully seeking an oracle named Shana who may have advice on shortening his trip, and asks Sadwick to help find her. Sadwick believes she could interpret his nightmares and convinces Bobby to give him the Whispering Stone to activate a secret passage that could lead him to Shana. Shortly after Bobby gets scared away and disappears in what Sadwick believes was an Asgil attack. Sadwick manages to locate Shana and finds out that his destiny is to destroy the world.Shana directs Sadwick to a nearby island to find mysterious Kalida who eventually takes him near Corona. There Sadwick manages to listen in to the plans of Asgil leader Loucaux but gets captured and thrown in a jail cell. After successfully escaping, he manages to board a flying train to Corona, where he meets Bobby again who tells him that he is too late and the king has locked himself in his quarters. After exploring the castle, Sadwick finds a model of a planetary system linked to the flow of space-and-time itself. He meets the royal astronomer who tells him that the Whispering Stone represents the planet Silentia in the model of 5 planets and that he must repair the system to restore the balance and activate the fountain of the Water of Life to wake the king who has fallen ill.Upon repairing the mechanism, a blue sphere from Sadwick's nightmares appears saying that Sadwick is inevitably ending the world. Trying to prevent that, Sadwick jams the planetary system's mechanism stopping time itself and breaking all of the world into pieces. The Asgil occupy what is left of the castle, but Sadwick manages to trick Loucaux and reactivates the planetary mechanism again, restoring the cadence of time. He escapes and arrives at the king's quarters, where he instead finds familiar settings and a large mirror. Upon looking into the mirror, another boy drags him into a room with two opposite mirrors. The boy explains that in reality Sadwick is this boy lying in a coma in a hospital while the blue sphere is his father reading him stories. Sadwick then breaks the mirror he came from and wakes up in the real world.Amazing game! Great Story! Love this story ^^^"

This is one of the things that makes the puzzles new and unique rather than same old adventure game puzzles over and over. I did not need a walk through in this game or skip any puzzles, but I did ask for help from people not playing this game for a couple of them. They are all solvable if you take your time ... or just press things randomly until you notice what's actually happening (sometimes not what you would expect).This series is worth playing twice, because so much in the first two games is easy to miss unless you see it in context with the whole.

If you spend more than 5 minutes on it, just check a walkthrough because if you don't get it immediately, you'll never get it.- The whole chips and remote deal was genious. Very nice indeed.- The Resistance bit was probably a bit rushed and underexplored.

This is a great, fun game and I had a lot of fun playing it. Some of the puzzles can be a bit on the ""I need to look this up on the internet"" difficulty but it doesn't bother me too much. Great music, fun character and lots of platypuses!! This is a really well made game and if you are like me and love playing point and click games then this is a good game to pick up."

Our master tinkerer is back in action and ready for even more fun! New puzzels, new locations and a new gameplay mechanic. This is a great example on how to make a great sequel for a game. This game comes with updated graphics (at least it looked like it) , an expanison to the plot of the first game and a lot of new stuff to discover. In total I can´t say a lot of things that I didn´t already mentioned in my review to Deponia because it has all the strengths of it.Pros:-The comic-style Graphics-Interesting Plot-Interesting Locations-New Gameplay Mechanics-Some funny moments-Some romantic momentsCons:-Way to easy, to get lostAn experience that is worth the money."

I like the storyline, I like the characters, I like the dialogue and voice acting, I like the artwork, I like the unusual and ridiculous puzzles, I like the addition of being able to switch between Goal's different characteristics... but still something doesn't quite fully grab me. Over all it's still enjoyable to play, and I'll play the last in the series too. I'd say they're worth recommending in the Steam rating system, but I wouldn't bother recommending them to anyone I actually know. I also wouldn't pay full price (£15.99), it's only worth getting on sale/in a bundle."

BUT, I would NEVER pay full prive for the game. It simply isnt worth 20 dollars. Instead, wait for a sale, wich seems to happen often enough. Overall, the game is enjoyable, with a good amount of gameplay and moderatly difficult puzzles, as well as a ridiculously funny story."
