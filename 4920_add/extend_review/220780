,Recommended,220780,14176405,"Posted: 26 January, 2015",all,Fancy Fish,"THOMAS WAS ALONE - A beautiful, minimalist indie 2D puzzle/platformer.|| 8.5 ||ScoreCommentGraphics8Simple but pleasing, using clean lines and shapes to form the game levels. Game Characters are also simple shapes with different colours but are easily identifiable. Background colours and effects have a different pallet for each level. The overall effect is minimalist, stylish and elegant.Audio10Relaxing ambient background music throughout the game and excellent story narration by Danny Wallace (He won a BAFTA for his performance). There really is nothing to fault here.Gameplay9Thomas was alone has simple and intuitive controls that respond well, giving good control of your characters. Levels start simply and get progressively more difficult at a fairly steady rate. I don't ever recall feeling overwhelmed at any point and play remained very enjoyable throughout the game. As you progress the game does a good job of introducing you to new concepts that you need to complete the levels like controlling various elements (doors, gravity, etc) through various pressure and trigger switches. Also as you progress you meet and gain control of other characters (besides Thomas) each of which have their own unique properties and abilities. You will often find that you will need to employ skill & logic as well as a bit of trial and error to successful navigate levels but fortunately the game does not punish you for failing, so play always seems fun.Story9I really didn't expect any kind of story from a puzzle platform game, especially not one where the characters are just little shapes, but despite this what I got was a brilliant one. A delightful little story that builds with each level and makes you really care about what happens to your little shapes. Each one has their own unique characters, fears, desires and personalities. Their struggles to survive and escape the unfair system that imprisons them and which is constantly changing the rules in its efforts to defeat them.Replayability6By the end of the game you will have mastered some pretty advanced skills and will remember many of the puzzles solutions, this makes some of the earlier levels feel very easy. The game is of a fairly good length but because its so enjoyable you will no doubt be left wanting more. There are various steam achievements (small black hollow rectangles) scattered throughout various levels and going back to find these will add to the playtime. Levels are re-playable after you have completed them making it a good game for quick casual play.Overall8.5A little gem of an indie game, charming and enjoyable, it leaves you wanting more - would highly recommend.More reviews by Fancy FishAgree / Disagree?

,Recommended,220780,22524363,"Posted: 19 April, 2016",all,ErickaUnlimited,"OverviewThomas Was Alone is a thought-provoking puzzle platformer created from the mind of Mike Bithel. The game originally started as a flash game back in 2010, before slowly making its way to Steam and  console systems a few years later.  As the player, you control Thomas-AT-23-6-12, or Thomas for short, an artificial polygon that has taken on a form of free thinking and is now questioning the world around him. As you progress the levels, you'll encounter and control several other characters, each with their own shape, narrated personality and unique ability to help you guide your way to the end of each level.The story takes place within a computer mainframe that is run by a company known as ""Artificial Life Solutions"". Due to a glitch in the mainframe or some other unknown error, several of the polygon AI have become suddenly self-aware and see the computer mainframe as the world in which they live. Each newly aware shape takes on a different personality: some more eager than the rest, one a little more scared than the others, while one is just worried about being used for her ability and another just wants to be a superhero.  While every character is narrated by a single person (Danny Wallace), each personality is as different as the shapes they come in; Mr. Wallace does a phenomenal job.Each shape's ability needs to be used to some degree to reach the end of the level: some jump higher than others, some float in water, some are tall, some are small, some defy gravity...etc. It is your job to guide these guys to the end. As you progress the story, you'll meet a new cast of characters, new puzzles to solve and more about the world Thomas and gang live in. There's a bit more to the story than first impressions realize and it's an intriguing story to flesh out over the course of the game. In total, there are ten segments of the game to play through, each with ten levels per segment.The difficulty of Thomas Was Alone consists of a very fine, gradual learning curve. The game does not suffer from issues of spiking difficulties or unfair level design, which gives the game a very mellow tone alongside the pleasant narration, making it a fun experience, not a frustrating one. I'm not the greatest platformer around, so if I can do it, you can too. ^_-In the end, Thomas Was Alone is a light-hearted joy to experience. I'd dive more into the plot, but I don't  want give away spoilers for those that have yet to play the game and have been lucky enough to not spoil it for themselves. You'll have to find out what has happened to Thomas and his friends, how have they become sentient, what are the ""shifters"", what's the pixel cloud about and who are the ""Architects?There's always something a game can improve on, but I feel hard-pressed to pinpoint what exactly I would change about this one. The positives truly do outshine any issues I did experience while playing it.ProsNarration - It's beautiful, it's calm and it's intriguing. I don't know how else to say it. I loved it.Character development - This is by and large the only game I've played that made me feel physical emotion towards geometric shapes. I genuinely developed feelings for them.It's an easy game to complete for those who like to achievement hunt.Difficulty - It felt very fluid throughout and never suffered from spikes or drops in difficulty at unforeseen times.ConsGame length - It's short and leaves me wanting more.Overall, Thomas Was Alone is a gem. I purchased this game on a whim a while ago based on other reviewers and was pleasantly surprised with it. The story is charming, the levels are fun, the characters are unique and interesting (even as colorful shapes that don't speak) and it all flows so seamlessly together. There are very few games I play more than once, especially when I complete them entirely, but Thomas Was Alone is definitely one of them. Check it out if you have not done so already! It's worth the try."

It is humoristically narrated by Danny Wallace, who really adds a dimension to the game that manages to make us empathize and feel for these little rectangles and square.It's a platforming puzzle game, it's very simplistic in nature, but efficient, and the Musical Score by David Housden is beautiful and enhances the game quite a lot.I enjoyed it."

,Not Recommended,220780,30702125,Posted: 24 March,all,Bonfire of DOOM!,"Thomas Was Alone's strongest point is its story and character with a brilliantly narrated script. It's a simple story told with a lot of heart. Gameplay mechanics help to emphasize each of the characters actions and motivations. By the end, I wanted to care about these characters. I wanted to see what the little rectangles would do.The emphasis there is ""wanted to care,"" because, frankly, I couldn't, as in the later sections of the game, every section of narration (the primary means of telling the story) is separated by repetitive, uninteresting, and incredibly unchallenging gameplay. Often, I'd race characters ahead, eager to skip to the next section of story, only to find that it would occasionally make the puzzle impossible and that I would, indeed, have to play some version of the Tower of Hanoi for several dozen iterations. Again. It completely shatters the pacing. I was struggling to keep playing through the game; the only thing that did keep me going was the charming narration. But at the end, it just... stops. The conclusion to the narrative isn't at all worth playing the game.I'd say go for it if you really, reaaaally like puzzle games, regardless of difficulty, but apparently this one wasn't for me."

Also, the platforming is not particularly memorable. It's never challenging, but it's often long and repetitive (you sometimes have to get to a point with three different characters, doing the same thing three times). However, I have to concede the characters' different abilities give some interest to the game, the narration is not bad and the minimalistic approach really got me. So yeah, all in all, a good purchase."

Here, however, it's done to almost perfection. The narrator gives life to differently coloured and shaped blocks, each with their struggles and personalities, and trust me, I've never cared so much for a bunch of squares.The story is driven by puzzle platforming, nothing too complex but presents the ocassional challenge or having to put the dome piece to work.Controls are responsive, game is on the short side but that's a plus, IMO. Graphich design and characters are spot on and it's very compelling to play."

It is a cute 2D platformer with simplistic graphics and a stunning use of narration and lighting. Now, the main draw for myself was the narration, and at the end of the experience, the narration was the highlight. It is difficult to describe the connections you end up making with each little character as you progress, all due to the clever use of narration. All the characters have distinct personalities, and all of them end up sticking with the player. I eventually even had a favorite character, and all the while I realized how ridiculous it was that this character happened to be a rectangle with a color assigned to it. Each character has its own gimmick. Whether it is jumping high, being able to swim, fit in tight spaces, etc. These gimmicks create the puzzles that make up the entire game. Without them it would be quite bland. They are always exciting, and easy to understand as they are introduced cleverly. Do I recommend it? Yes I do. For those who want a slow-paced, narrative driven puzzler, this game is the best out there. I loved it. An experience I will remember for years to come."

The story of this platform game draws you in and keeps you until the end. It tells the story of a bunch of rectangles who are released in a computer AI and work to be free. The narration gives personality to each of these rectangles. There is Thomas, the salmon rectangle. Chris, the stout orange square who is self concsious because he can't jump high. John the tall yellow rectangle who likes to show off. Claire the big blue square who finds she is a superhero because she can float on water. Laura a pink rectangle who is a trampoline. James the inverted green rectangle who people shy away from because he is weird.

I've finally played it and was delighted. We get to follow a bunch of colourful squares who have loads of personality and different skills. There's pensive Thomas who is rather average, Chris the pessimist (who has a soft spot somewhere in his heart) whose skills are more of a supportive kind, sporty John who can take enormous leaps, Claire the super hero who can do something none of the others can and a few more. Working together, they happen to stumble into changing the world, as we learn from the enthusiastic and loveable narration.The levels are bite-sized so you can stop playing at any time without losing too much progress. Difficulty varies between easy, just right and the slightest bit hard. If I got stuck, it was never for long: Usually I would find the solution rather quickly, and if the characters died, it helped that savepoints were distributed fairly whenever necessary. One has to do it correctly for sure, but one doesn't get punished for messing up 1 of 20 steps in a sequence.The game gets bonus points from me for allowing the player to return to each and every level to pick up missed achievements.Addendum: After completing the game, I found that a free DLC had unlocked in the shape of a new scenario called ""Target"". That one is definitely harder than the main game due to two things in combination: 1) Wonky flight controls , 2) oh so many spikes. Less of a thumb up for that part from me."

,Recommended,220780,532047,"Posted: 17 July, 2013",all,Llobster,Thomas Was Alone is an amazing feat of storytelling.  It is a tale involving rectangles as the main characters.  About half way through the adventure you realize that you really care about them.  A moving and subtle soundtrack coupled with superb writing and narration breathes more life and  humanity into the rectangles than 90% of any other game or movie in recent memory.  The story is not complex.  It is a straight-forward epic of friendship and sacrifice but so well done that it doesn't need any plot twists or suprise revelations to be impactful.  The gameplay is fairly simple puzzle platforming.  You are always pretty sure exactly how to get through the level.  Although simple I still found the gameplay enjoyable.  There are some really clever uses of the game's mechanics and different characer's abilities working together sprinkled throughout the game but no real mind straining puzzles.  The design of the levels is really sharp so the simplicity of the puzzles seems to be a design chioce so as not to get in the way of the narrative the developers were trying to tell.  I really enjoyed my time playing this game and reccomened it without reservation.p.s. - control is much more fluid with a gamepad.

Caring for Squares and Rectangles.Genre: 2D Story Platformer.Developed & Published by: Bithell GamesPlatform: Windows, MacBusiness Model: Base GameCopy Purchased by MyselfOverall Gameplay ThoughtsHere's another great indie platformer game where the characters are mere blocks. Blocks of different shapes, sizes and colors mind you, but blocks nonetheless. Narrated with a lovely British accent, it takes you on quite the adventure, following these colored blocks around to the point that you almost begin to think they were  real characters. So, what I'm saying is that the story is very good. It's quite impressive that it can make you care, even a little, about inanimate objects given human personifications.Platforming ThoughtsThat said, the platforming gameplay is all over the place. It varies from annoyingly challenging to ridiculously simple with each level feeling like it was put in a random order. The spikes are just odd to experience. I also found that switching between the 7 blocks got very tiresome towards the end. The game really drags itself down as you play towards the end compared to how quick the pace was early on.PC SettingsI suggest using a controller for this title otherwise some of the difficulty spikes might be a bit too much. For PC settings, all you have are keybinding options, resolutions and a graphics quality slider in the pre-game launcher. The slider dictates whether you have AA or V-Sync. Set it to beautiful to get everything. All you can change in-game is music and sound options. Music is great I might add. I didn't notice any optimization problems nor had any crashes.Final ThoughtsIt's one of my favorites of 2013. Thomas was Alone is one of those platformers you should definitely check out. Full of character and charm, you can get a solid three hours of fun out of it. Something that I don't get that often from platformers.Read this review and more on A Paladin Without A Crusade"

,Recommended,220780,16470312,"Posted: 17 June, 2015",all,MMMiguel,"It had its ups and downs. Literally and figuratively.The game has a nice way of combining the introduction of new gameplay concepts and narrative and can be praised for how these two elements are interwoven. However, both gameplay and story seem a bit stretched with a lot of repetition, sometimes even within one level. It alomst seems like the developers had an idea how long the game should be, but they didn't have enough unique ideas to fill that time so they built in some repetitions. There is no proper difficulty curve to speak of, even in the later episodes you can come across levels that are easy and easily forgettable. Considering that this is a puzzle platformer where you would expect an increasing difficulty and new puzzling ideas with each new level, these are major problemsThe narrative takes quite some time to become interesting and to make sense of what story is supposed to be told. There are hints what's going on even in the earlier levels and the narrator does a nice job giving character to the moving blocks, but it took until about the second half of the game for me to become more enganged in what's happening. The finale is also not the most satisfying one.The soundtrack can become very annoying and even though its supposed to be dynamic and procedurally generated, I can't see at all how its supposed to fit the gameplay. The OST has an ambient/post-rock vibe to it and randomly becomes very noisy and agitated, which NEVER fit the situation, even in more climactic points of the story.I'd still recommend this game for its unique experimental approach in using video games as a storytelling medium. It has some artistic value because it finds new ways of conveying ideas and has an approach to narrative which creates characters where you would least expect them. It is however not flawless and has the above mentioned pacing and sound problems.If you're primarily interested in minimalist, abstract, experimental aspects of games, then go and get it."

,Recommended,220780,10166612,"Posted: 18 May, 2014",all,tzumainn,"Thomas Was Alone is a sneaky, tricky, deceptive game.  I say that because so much of it is simple.  And yet...The gameplay is straightforward. Navigate one or more blocks through short and discrete levels with simple obstacles ranging from small pits to moving platforms to spiked ceilings.  Each block has different attributes and abilities: one can jump high, one can float in water, one can act as a trampoline, and so on.  It's not a complex idea, and yet it is executed so well that it is very easy to lose yourself in the pulse of the game, playing level after level well into the night.Playing the game is a joy, but what brings the game close to transcendence is the storytelling.  Each block has a distinct voice and, more importantly, an immediately relatable personality: one is an observer, one dreams of being a superhero, one is jealous of the others' talents.  Again nothing complex, and yet that very simplicity allows the player to immediately relate with each block - their dreams and fears and hopes and insecurities.At first this engagement is simply amusing, another minor incentive to keep the player pushing through the game.  But as the plot unfolds and the blocks begin to understand the true nature of their situation, the player becomes truly invested.  And when the blocks individually come to their moments of self-realization, I found them each aspirational.There are a few minor flaws in Thomas Was Alone - the last chapters feel a bit anti-climatic, and there are some annoying jumping challenges - but nothing that should stop anyone from playing the game.---------- Elliot Was Alone ------------Elliot was kicking at the scruffy soccer ball when he heard his sister shout, ""Cape cape CAPE!""They were alone in their aunt's apartment, a stifling small two bedroom in a fading complex. ""Better than a foster home,"" his aunt had shrugged. She was right, of course, and her being right just made everything worse.The sudden spike of fury was sharp and would not be contained. Elliot set his left foot and used the right to whack the ball against the flaking wall. It bounced off with a sharpcrack, and something in the bathroom fell to the floor and shattered. Elliot cursed - loudly - and slammed open the door to the bedroom that he shared with his sister.""You're not supposed to say that word,"" Abby said without looking up. Being chastised by a sibling four years his junior - or was it five? it was strangely difficult to keep track these days, with time feeling soft like clay - did little to improve his mood. ""A cape?"" he said, ignoring her comment. ""You made your dumb blocks capes?""Now Abby did look up, but only to smile. ""Just one cape,"" she said, holding up a badly cut paper square. There was a picture on it, drawn in crayon, of something that might have been a mutated two-headed cat. ""Claire wants one.""Elliot rolled his eyes. ""Claire"" was a big wooden cube scribbled through with whorls of blue. Months after the accident Abby had taken six or seven of her blocks and colored them each with its own color. Then she had given them not only names, but distinct personalities as well. ""Thomas likes to watch things,"" she might say as she bounced the red block along the floor. Or,tossing the purple one up into the air: ""Look! How can Sarah even go so high? She must have amazing powers!""Sometimes it was all Elliot could do to stop himself from throwing the blocks down the garbage chute. He imagined the pleasure he would feel listening to the gong-like sounds the blocks would make as they bounced off the sides.""Claire's a superhero, you see,"" Abby continued in a matter-of-fact tone. ""She's the only one of them that can float in water. Like a rubber duckie."" She put her hand to the side of her mouth; whispering loudly she said, ""She can't jump very high though, but. . . look what happens when she jumps on top of Laura!"" Laura was a pink block laying horizontally on the ground. Abby took Claire and touched the blue block to Laura; then she made awhooshing noise and arcedClaire high over her head.Elliot could only stare. ""Are you kidding me?""Abby looked puzzled. ""Kidding about what?"" She set Claire before her and reached for the cape.""About. . . about all of this!"" He squatted down. ""It's all sostupid,"" he said, picking up a yellow block and shaking it in front of Abby's face. His anger was growing again, like it so often did these days. He didn't want it to. He just couldn't help it. ""And this cape, what do you think it - ?""He snatched at the cape expecting his sister to let go, like she always did when he grabbed at something. But this time her skinny fingers held on tight. And the paper ripped in two.The silence that ensued rang loudly in Elliot's ears. Time crept like a worm while his face flamed and his stomach roiled, and it was an eternity before he finally stammered, ""I. . . I didn't mean. . ."" Then he stopped. Because of course what wasmeantdidn't matter. Nothing that had happened in the past year had beenmeant. But itwas, and why did it always feel like he was the one, the only one, that had to deal with the consequences?The resentment inside of him was like a stone; it centered him. He took a sullen breath. ""It was just a dumb cape. I can -"" he began. Then he met Abby's eyes and stopped again, this time out of shock. Her face was stiff and her eyes were burning, and although he had never seen his sister that way, he recognized the look at once - because it was like looking in a mirror. And that was when he realized that he wasn't the only one that had to deal with consequences.""I'm sorry,"" he whispered. ""I'm sorry. Can I - ?""""No!"" she shrieked, and Elliot watched, sick inside, as she half-rose with the force of her word.""Yes,"" Abby muttered, sitting back down. She tossed a small orange block at him; he caught it\ out of the air. ""You can be Chris.""Elliot kept his mouth shut, swallowing his first response back down his throat. Then he asked in an even voice, ""What's Chris like? What can he do?""""Nothing,"" snapped his sister. ""He's small and mean and he can't even jump very high.""His anger was gone now. It had been replaced by shame, a whole ocean of it, enough to drown him a thousand times over. Was it better to feel like this? He rubbed his eyes. Maybe it was. At least he wouldn't hurt anybody this way.Abby touched his arm then, softly. ""Hey,"" she said. ""But, you know, Chris isn't. . . he isn't reallymean. He's just confused. Confused and. . ."" She paused. "". . . and sad."" Her face relaxed. ""He doesn't know it yet, but he's going to be a hero. Just like the rest of them.""Elliot smiled. ""Tell me.""Abby began to talk, and Elliot sat and watched in wonder as his sister's face bloomed once more."

The game somehow manages to get you to develop sympathy and scorn for the otherwise-generic blocks you control. Other strong points are the music, voice acting, visual aesthetic, and varied jumping mechanics and player-character properties.  I think a weak point is the difficulty level--it's pretty low. Not once did I have to think for more than 5 seconds before figuring out the puzzles.  So eventually the levels became rituals of moving the blocks around so I could get to the next level and move the story along.What made me buy this game ultimately was that Kotaku said ""The jump in Thomas Was Alone might be amongst the best ever programmed."" So, as a platformer junky, I couldn't pass it up.  The jumps are indeed very good. You're quite firmly in control of the little blocks, although sometimes I felt like the acceleration late in the jump was a little too high, but that's a personal preference. My jump mechanic award goes to Super Meat Boy and Spelunky, but whatever.All in all, this game delivers a good platform/puzzle experience with a unique and compelling story, which is very rare in this genre."

They interact with each other physically in order to solve puzzles, but perhaps equally as important is the way they interact with each other emotionally, developing relationships, romances and rivalries like the most human characters could.Do not be deceived by the brevity in this game's description. Like Portal and Cave Story, the simple gameplay, neatly summed up in a few quick, concise comments, hides a gripping narrative that perfectly humanizes a bunch of... rectangles. As many reviews before mine have accurately expressed, you'll find yourself getting more attached to geometry than you ever did in math class.The game is fairly short, a few hours from start to finish, but appropriately so. While puzzle games like this one lend themselves to infinite possible configurations that can be solved using the unique properties of the tools at hand, Thomas Was Alone finds just the right number of configurations to keep the game interesting and thought provoking -- and, perhaps even more importantly, just the right number to keep the narrative, and the relationships between your group of characters, moving at an approachable, human pace. By the time the game is over, you will have revelled in the story, but you won't be left wanting more; just those few hours, those few wonderful hours with your jumping, bouncing rectangles are so immeasurably satisfying that you'll immediately set about writing a gushing review like this one.In short, a quick little bite of skilful puzzle platforming gameplay with a masterful story that will keep you glued to your seat right to the very end."

Add to it great dialogue and atmopsheric music, and you've got a really fun game. It's not terribly long, maybe a few hours, but it's worth it. The levels start off easier but get pretty crazy once you start combining double jumps, reversed gravity, a trampoline and switches to swap between various abilitites.My only con: The music is great, but sometimes it seemed really dissonant, like there were two different tracks playing on top of each other in different keys. I don't know if this was intentional to set a mood or just some glitch that makes the music hang over from level to level.I've never cared so much about a bunch of quadrilaterals before in my life."

A short review for a short game: while it does have a peculiar postmodern charm, I hadn't sufficient enjoyment from the game to offer my recommendation.The experience is a bit shy of 3 hours in total, including the bonus missions separate from the main story. Ostensibly a puzzle-platformer, the puzzles are too rudimentary to engage, and the platforming similarly lacks challenge. Consequently, the primary challenge offered is exercising the patience to slowly move each of a half dozen pieces one at a time to their obvious positions, cycling slowly through them with unnecessarily awkward controls. The game uses a sparse visual style that is inoffensive, but certainly does not impress: it's a 2D game made up of moving blocks and very limited animation. A visual force this game is not. The ambient, often shoegaze-styled score is somewhat enjoyable, but I encountered frequent audio bugs which marred the experience. I'd often hear duplicated background music playing with a slight offset, and the previous level's soundtrack would often fail to stop, leaving a cocophonous overlap blaring until I restarted the game. Given the mediocre gameplay, the spartan visual style, soundtrack, and narration are the main feature of the game. Unfortunately, I found the narrative similarly uninspiring; you simply push your quadrilaterals along their predetermined paths while a narrator intones their thoughts and feelings. It perhaps resembles a primary school teacher reading to young children; perhaps an audience of a younger age group may delight at the motivations of this animate geometry. Alas, I did not."

A company known as 'Artificial Life Solutions' become aware that a 'spike incident' has led to several of their created ai becoming conscious. One of those ai known as Thomas (a simple note taker) starts off alone, but soon discovers an assortment of other ai in the system who also have their own unique talents. One of those discovered ai known as 'Laura' is quite different though. She is always accompanied by a ominous pixel cloud which seems somewhat menacing. Little do the ai know, Laura included, that the pixel cloud is supposedly a creation of 'Artificial Life Solutions', a splinter effect from Laura whose designed to use laura as bait to help it capture and quarantine rogue ai like they are some sort of virus. As one by one they fall prey, they begin to meet 2 more ai that can help them escape this quarantine, but this comes at a price. They must help one of those ai get to the 'fountains of wisdom' (the internet) which they have heard of. Thomas agrees and immediately embarks on a new trepid adventure which culminates with he, himself, alone, being the only one who manages to spend 12 whole seconds inside the internet.This simple note taker overwhelmed by the stimuli of the world that he knew and the open world which he became exposed too, begins to understand how ai can escape and what the purpose of his being is. He convinces the other ai that they they need to martyr themselves so that future generations can benefit by each of their unique talents and use this portal of the internet to escape the current system they are in and enter the real world. They need to find the creation matrix (the thing responsible for generating their world) and alter its matrix so that their powers become part of the system itself which other ai can use.Not long after we are introduced to this second generation AI, five of which begin to take advantage of this new changed world that secretly is guiding them to their escapes all thanks to these 7 martyred ai who are now hailed as the architects. However it soon becomes apparent that one of the 5 second generation ai has evil plans if they are ever to escape. What are those plans? What will the other 4 ever do about it? Will anyone ever escape and download themselves into the real world? Where will they go? What exactly is the pixel cloud and where did it all begin?In truth the game never really answers many of these questions but instead just abruptly ends. While it opens itself for an intriguing sequel, truth be know that developer Mike Bithell (cool last name) has moved onto his second generation with absolutely no promise of future development on this title.When you complete this game, the ending, unknown to you since the game itself does not advertise it will unlock chapters 10 and 11. To get to these you need to go to options and click on scenarios and then click on the word target and play that to the end to unlock chapter 11. Both these chapters act as a prequel on what happened to Sarah, before she bumped into Thomas. It also shows you how dangerous it was what Thomas did as the character before Thomas was not as succesful when trying to access the internet.Chapters 10 and 11 are significantly harder. At times you might have feelings of impossibility. The saving grace is that the spawn points are not too far from each other so you only need one attempt to work for you to move on. This game is definitely possible to 100% .I have criticised many games in the past for cutting corners and not adding proper voice narration or recording (ie the Detail ) many of which simply claim it is too expensive and a risky investment. However proper narration will undoubetdly change a mediocre game into one of brilliance which can be found here. It is hard to imagine this game being as succesful if it was not for the talent of the hired comedian Danny Wallace. So how much did it cost Michael Bithell? It actually costed somewhere around $4,000.00. While that might sound a lot for simply speaking a few lines in a microphone and I'm sure there are many homeless beggars with a melodic palate, regardless opting out for voice narration to simply SAVE money will most likely a cost most developers their game to be eventually tossed in those gutters to accompany those homeless beggars with melodic voices you chose not to hire.In short Michael Bithell knew what he needed to do to make his game well recieved and was willing to pay that price and he has done it again even with his new game 'volume' hiring the same comedian again as a narrator.  Evidently he has no regrets for making those decisions and as time moves on and people continue to love 'Thomas was Alone' and hopefully with sequels or more dlc in future, those prices made would be well spent."

But instead, each level has a voiceover and dialogue which progresses a story, and shows the personalities of each of the blocks that appear in the game.The dialogue is witty and well done, and you really do find yourself caring about that motely bunch of rectangles that you're controlling, which is unexpected. You wouldn't think you could get attached to something that was just a colourful block, but this game does it. The dialogue can make you laugh and it goes in with the levels and the tasks the blocks have to go through.It just goes to show that a good story and good characterisation can make even the most minimalistic of games an emotional experience where you care about the things you are controlling, to the point where failing puzzles isn't so bad.ControlsThe controls are smooth, they work fine with keyboard and gamepad and were responsive, I didn't make many awkward jumps or struggle with obstacles due to this. The loading screen sometimes took a while and made it feel not so smooth.GraphicsThe graphics are very simple, the colour scheme is good so you can identify everything well between the rectangles and obstacles offered. One interesting effect about the graphics was how the light on a block followed you as you moved, making it seem more advanced and visually easier to follow what was going on. It probably isn't so noticeable unless you were really concentrating.MusicFor a puzzle game, this has really relaxing music, which is nice considering puzzle games can at times get your brain really crunching in how to solve something, or stress you out. The music helps make it a more enjoyable process. The sounds itself help give character for the whole experience. The different sounds the boxes make give each one insight to their personalities, and the voiceover with an english accent is soothing and fits right in with the background music and the individual noises the rectangles make. This all combines together to make the game even more compelling beyond its simple visuals, and not many games can do something like thatOverall verdictA story telling puzzle game like no other...I cannot say much more than : I loved it, I adored it...

If you are one of those that solely live off of hyper-stimulating fast FPS and arcade-like games, you may find TWA too unviolent and thought-provoking. But all of its respective parts are very well done and come together as a seamless whole. Its a wonderful change of pace for any genre-gamer, a nice relaxing (and unfrustrating!) choice. The narration is great and really makes you want to get to the next level to see how the little shapes are dealing with their adventure. Hey, its worth it for the controls alone. I think everyone should get the chance to play a game with controls this good at least once!MAIN:Ok, so as I'm sure you all know, Thomas Was Alone (TWA) is a puzzle platformer, where you have to use your resources to solve maps Theres a million of games like that out there. I generally stay away from them. But I had been looking at TWA for a long time, and since it was on sale, I grabbed it.And I have to say I'm pleasantly surprised. This game is beautifully addictive. The plot is pretty simple at first. You start as a  red rectangle named Thomas (who, based on the storyline appears to be a tiny bit of AI coding). Thomas is alone. He doesnt want to be alone. He doesnt know where he is, how he got there. He decides to set off and explore and learn, jumping his way through the levels to the portal at the end.Thomas' journey is dictated by a male narrator with a British accent, who says a few sentences at the start of every level, and sometimes a sentence or two at important points in the level. This narrator is what really pulls the game together and keeps it from being boring. The narrator tells you Thomas' thoughts and feelings (and later those of his friends as well). The dialogue is pretty clever, and really makes you begin to care about the journey of Thomas.Thomas eventually meets other little shapes too, all with varying sizes, jumping ability, and personalities. Each shape has its own portal only it can fit in. Sometimes they are all together, and sometimes they are scattered around.The game mechanics are incredibly intuitive. Within seconds, even an unexperienced gamer can figure out how the game works. The base mechanic is jumping, and using the different shapes to jump over areas too high for one character. For instance, Chris (an orange square) can't jump hardly at all. But if he jumps up on Thomas, he can then jump even farther. Once you get more than two characters, you can stack them all up on top of each other and then switch back to the bottom character to move the whole stack. Characters which are carrying others cant jump, though.The controls are literally some of the  most responsive and fluid Ive ever seen, which is always very important in a puzzle/platformer that relies on jumps. In TWA theres no frustrating missing platforms due to faulty controls, the jumps stick perfectly and exactly where you wanted to put them. Rest assured that if you miss a jump in TWA, you missed it because you f'ed up, not due to the controls.The graphics are minimalist, but have a strange charm all of their own. As I said, evey playable character is a shape. So far, rectangles and squares of varying sizes. The platforms are black, and the background is a single color with various details floating in it. The shadowing is pretty cool. Certain areas have slightly more lit up places, and as the map moves, the platforms and character throw shadows around.The sounds are minimal besides the voice of the narrator and the sounds of the charcters jumps (a traditional mild ""sproing""). The soundtrack is full of beautiful dreamlike scores that give the game both a hopeful and surreal feel.Its worth getting. Even if you dont normally play these types of games (as I dont) you may find yourself liking this one."

Each of its little coloured blocks has a different ability (small size, double-jump, inverted gravity...) and a wry, twee little characterisation of its own. The game is pleasant to look at and has good-quality narration. If you happen to die, the respawn is very quick which helps avoid frustration.However, you never really feel like the game is letting you off its rails. The puzzles are almost all so obvious that they're tiresome to complete, especially given that the jump button is finicky and unresponsive. The one solution that struck me as being interesting and clever was telegraphed by the blocks' starting positions, which seemed like a bit of an insult to the players' intelligence. There are very few sections where you get any freedom to go platforming. Maybe this is part of the story/metaphor/thing, but frankly that isn't really interesting or coherent enough to sacrifice fun anyway.There's a good game concept and a nice little story in here somewhere, but sadly it's chopped off at the knees by dull level design and some slapdash writing."

Throughout each level there's small accompanying narration by UK comedian Danny Wallace, this narration is what gives the game it's unique charm that isn't often seen in games managing to be both heartfelt and witty on numerous occasion.

The puzzles are challenging, but the mechanics are both encouraging and a lot of fun to learn. Thomas Was Alone entails simple, sweet storylines about friendship and rivalry, self-confidence and pride, teamwork and isolation—all of which are propelled by the design of the platforms themselves and the gradual introduction of new elements throughout gameplay.

You play as several rectangles/squares, each with different names and varying personalities. After a serendipitous fluke, an A.I. named Thomas is created. He decides he wants to learn about the world, and as his adventure goes on, he meets other A.I.s. When people talk about fusing narrative with gameplay, TWA is a great example of this. All of the characters abilities and (limited) appearances reflect their personalities and their motives. For some strange reason, I became emotionally invested with these simple geometric shapes. There are even some tear-jerker moments strewn throughout, which delightfully caught me by surprise. The writing (all of it narrated, reminiscent of the Stanley Parable... the mod came out before) for them is very comedic and charming, making you want to keep seeing these shapes interact and finish their goals. I would like to say more about the narrative and characters, but anything is really a spoiler, and it is better to experience it without any prior knowledge.The presentation for the game is quite pretty actually. Like I've said, the art style is minimal, but it doesn't make the game look boring. The lighting effects look nice while the squares slide through the environment, and their pastel colors contrast the stark black obstacles and the shaded background. It shows they have life in the dead computer world they inhabit.Along with the art style is the soundtrack. The songs consist usually of violins, piano, and a reoccuring electronic melody. It is gorgeous, and really enhances the emotional impact of the more melancholic levels. One of my favorite pieces included ascending guitar tremolo, very similar to popular post-rock sounds (Sigur Ros, Godspeed You! Black Emperor). It just heightened everything I was feeling so much, that it is one of the most memorable gaming moments I have had yet.However, the game isn't perfect. The thing is, the game really leaves you wanting more with the characters. A narration only happens twice (I might be wrong on that, but I'm pretty sure) within a stage, so it is very limiting to how much anyone can talk. The game is quite short, taking four hours and 100 stages, leaving only (approximately) 200 bits of dialogue.The biggest problem with the game is the puzzles. I think ""puzzles"" is the wrong term for what you navigate in the game. They are more akin to obstacle courses, where you have to avoid spikes or hot water, and have to use teamwork between the squares to press buttons, make jumps, and get to each shape's respective portal. These obstacle courses leave much to be desired. Sure, the ones in the game already do make the characters seem to have a better connection when they have to help each other finish a stage. If there was more challenge to finishing a stage, they would seem more dependent with each other's help, and the catharsis of completing a hard puzzle would be like a high-five moment between them.Thomas Was Alone is an interesting gem. I found its story/characters just as interesting as bigger indies like Braid and Bastion, but it lacks in the overall gameplay department. I can see this being a staple for my future children, as it is simple enough for them to play, and has a light-hearted atmosphere with some poignantly sad moments sprinkled throughout to (hopefully) keep it memorable for them. Thomas Was Alone definitely is for me."

Looking at the game itself there is not much to offer. The puzzles are all basic 2-D platformers and I only found myself stuck one or two times.But that is about all that is wrong with this game. For a 2-D game the graphics and lighting effects are stunning and the real draw of the game is the story. Although confusing at first the pieces start to come together intro an elaborate idea but is never completely clarified. Along the journey too is one of the best narrators I have heard with a perfect mix of seriousness and joy.A few minor issues I had with the game were losing the immersion when I had to restart a level and the narrator repeated all the lines again and the story was fantastic but felt a bit too rushed at the end with much more going on compacted into a much shorter time span. Also there is not much to offer in replay value as there is just the main story and no other extra levels though that is fine for the value.I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys more than just gameplay because what this game really has to offer is in the story and beauty it holds."

Yeah, I was a bit late to the party, this game being released in 2010 (and then later in 2012), but it is probably rather timeless (at least until true AI become an important reality), with its minimalistic art design, Danny Wallace's fantastic narration, Valve-and-Douglas-Adams-inspired design and writing, and David Housden's simply gorgeous score.If you are looking for a game that has one or seven of those breathtaking, awe-inspiring moments, all while only being a game about squares and rectangles, I urgently recommend Thomas Was Alone. In addition it creates more emotional investment and demonstrates better character development than most triple-A games, again, all while being the unwavering story of a few quadrilaterals.THIS IS ART.P.S. - While the main game is just sheerly fantastic, the additional chapters 10 and 11 are better worth skipping. The quality of voice acting or composition of course does not waver, although I would argue the story is much less compelling, but I would advice against really trying to playthrough Benjamin's story simply because the actual gameplay falters wildly. It moves away from the brilliant and elegant puzzle-platforming to just that really infuriating kind of platforming. No thought needed, at least initially, just irritating execution that really breaks the beauty of the game.I don't typically condone watching Let's Plays about a game you haven't played; actually I think it's the worst thing you can possibly do, as the entire unique point of games is their interactive element, and when you delegate the experience to watching someone else play it, you are completely removing the immersion and ruining very deliberate game design (as opposed to a passive media like film or music).However, getting through mindless execution challenges is usually not worth the hours spent if you don't enjoy that kind of thing, and watching someone else play the extra levels may be the most prudent option.But of course if you like that kind of painstaking gameplay where it's just thick trial-and-death design without the strategic or puzzle-based aspects (or the rare and wonderful design where dying doesn't break the fun like in Super Meat Boy or Long Live The Queen), go for it.Again, these last extra two chapters are additional, and the core game is well worth the price."
,Recommended,220780,10403628,"Posted: 9 June, 2014",all,Stridge,"Thomas was alone is a beautiful game. A great game. A fantastic game.You play as a cast of rectangles and squares, inside a program dedicated to creating artificial intelligence. They all have names. The one you start out with is Thomas, and he is alone. In the beginning of the game, you realize that Thomas would meet an untimely end, in some shape or form, but you play the game to get a feel for it's controls.And then, the game takes a pleasant turn.The narraration is beautiful. The voice tells you what all of the characters are thinking and expressing, without a need for voice actors. It makes each character, while different in play style, relatable or at the very least, understandable. For being two dimensional objects, they all form three dimensional personalities. The fact that they have different and unique abilities changes up the puzzles and makes the game much more fantastic. It really feels like you're exploring a virtual world born with artificial intelligence. And the game does this without cutscenes or character voices.The puzzles are fun, the gameplay easy to pick up, and even though the levels are fairly basic, it has it's share of moderate difficulty situations. I wish it had some harder ones. The controls are fluid and the game is solidly built because of that. Nothing terrible complex and no bugs as far as I can tell.(SPOILER ALERT)As you continue through the game, there's a point at which Thomas and your original cast... just aren't there anymore. Maybe this was to make it so that you valued the characters more, but it simply made me upset. The ending that I was expecting for my main cast didn't exist. They didn't go out in a blaze of glory or defy the original premise of the game or become true heroes. The game just pretended like they never existed.And that's what drew out the last few levels. The storyline drew me in so that I could recite the orginal cast by name and what their personality was like, even though the game is just a series of rectangles. The game took that story away from me. The game cheated me out of all the friends that I had fallen in love with. It was no longer about a story, but getting to the end. That seemed boring and almost repetitive.Overall, this is a good game, but the story will aggrivate you to your very core. My heart tells me to rate it less and my brain tells me to rate it more, but it's a solid 8/10."

Along the way you make some new friends with different colors and abilities. Some are small and can't jump as high, others help everyone jump farther. The goal is to traverse the level by getting all the shapes to the appropriate portal.The platforming of the game is tight and feels good. It never gets too difficult either. A few levels require some faster jumping, but in general it's pretty forgiving. In fact, in most places it's not forgiving there will be mid-level saves. If you're coming from something like Super Meat Boy, this will be a walk in the park.The puzzles are simple and there's rarely an ""A-ha!"" moment. This isn't to say they're not well done, but don't expect anything mind bending. This much more of a platformer than a puzzle game. There are a few moments where the game makes clever use of it's mechanics to create some of the funner puzzles.The story actually makes you care about Thomas and the other characters. The story is entertaining and the voice over narative is charming.The game is on the shorter side. I beat the main campaign in under four hours including the level 10 bonus missions and only missed two achievements.

Because the narration, and the little blurbs between the different stages, turn this into a compelling narrative and turn simple coloured quadrilaterals into characters.

,Recommended,220780,22440649,"Posted: 15 April, 2016",all,*audibly xDs*,"Thomas Was Alone is an incredible game.  I'm sure just about everyone that has completed the game would say the same.  The music is fantastic, the background animations are beautiful yet subtle enough to keep the focus on the game, the gameplay is relaxing, and Danny Wallace's voice acting was nothing short of perfection.  And to top it all off, the story is amazing.However, no game is perfect, and I'd prefer not to treat any game as such.  Below this is the few flaws I have with the game, but I am putting it in spoiler text for two important reasons.  The first is that I honestly feel like if someone is looking to buy this game, they should not know about these flaws.  As silly as it sounds, the flaws are not nearly as large as one must portray through text, and I feel like the flaws would stand out more and be more of an annoyance for someone that knew about them beforehand.  The second reason is that it contains actual spoilers.With all that being said, if you are looking to buy this game, stop reading and buy it already.  The story will move you and you will not regret the purchase.Continuation below:Alright, so as incredible as the game is, there were two flaws that slightly bother me looking back.  The first and largest complaint for me would be that there were simply too many main characters in the story.  Personally, I think that The Architects (Thomas, Chris, John, Claire, Laura, James, Sarah) should have been the only playable characters in the game.  The storyline simply became too complicated once The Second Generation AIs (Grey, Sam, Jo, Paul, Team Jump) entered the narrative.  Twelve main characters is a LOT, and it's simply too many for a rather short story like this one.  The Architects were all captivating characters with great personalities, and I think that if Mike Bithell decided to expand on those characters rather than introduce five brand new ones towards the end of the story, it would have been better.Secondly, I wish that as the game progressed, they decided to ramp up on the difficulty in terms of puzzles rather than in platforming.  That's hard to say considering the thousands of hours I've put into countless platformers, but I feel like there was more room for expansion in the puzzle aspect of the game than in the platforming aspect.  The skill in the late game was based off of your ability to micro-manage all of the characters, and if you screwed it up you would have to do a significant portion, or possibly all of it over again.  I guess your ability to micro-manage is puzzle based, but it's very linear.  There simply isn't much room for expansion in that skill set.  While Bithell did experiment in other puzzle aspects, the clear focus was the ability to micro-manage and I feel like that was not the best decision.However, these two issues barely dent this game's integrity and I would still absolutely recommend it to anyone and everyone.Overall, 9/10"

In this game you are playing as a collection of squares and rectangles of different colors with different personality while a charming narrator does some fine voice acting for these said blocks. The narration is in fact SO good that you will end up finding a connection with these blocks and start to imagine their facial expresions along with their voices as you play through the game. Gameplay does indeed live up to the Puzzle tag and will try to challenge you with levels and stages (every stage is ten levels, but every level can be of different lengths). THe game also sticks to the Platformer tag as you will be JUMPING for a majority of the game. There art style of the game is fine and can be a bit meaningful as there are different color blocks with varying emotions/feelings to each other. Cons include the music for sometiems it would become buggy and overlap with songs from previous levels. The other Con is that the game is short in gameplay hours. I finished this game in only 3 hours after buying this game just yesterday, but other than these Cons the game as a whole is fine.

I won't say it's mundane, but a third-grader could complete it with some time and effort. It introduces a drastically new element with every character, so the game never really got dull. One downside is the length. Seems a little longer than about two flash games put together. Don't get me wrong, this game is 10000 times better than any puzzle flash game, but it's really too short.I beat it in about 3-5 hours.The final dissapointing thing: on alot of levels, you could rush in and guess at what to do until you found it.

I guess I'll recommend this game if you can get it on sale, but I I feel like, without a really great story, this is just an abstract puzzle platformer with some good production values. I think one metric for measuring how successful the story was depends on whether or not it got the player to care about characters who are basically quadrilaterals of different sizes and colors.

It starts just with Thomas (alone, of course), that is a rectangle, and meets some new friends (shapes), six total at the main story, and they start to help each other to solve the puzzles and they kinda create a gang, group of friends, and there are some relations between some of the characters, and all of this is awesome.GameplayThe puzzles in the game are actually pretty standart, but the coop aspect with the Thomas' friends are amazing. You need to think like they were one individual. And you discover more of the story, more you play, so, I think it's pretty simple to understand the mechanics and what you can do and what you can't with each character (like height jump, special abilities). Generally, it's a game to appreciate, and separate some time to spend in, because it'll give you good smiles, laughs and you will feel relaxed.Pros and ConsPros-It's relaxing.-It's simple.-It's very very funny!Cons-None!:)ConclusionYou should definitely buy this game if you have the money. It's terrific if you consider what you paid. The peace you experience with Thomas Was Alone is absolutely incredible, the game immerses you with Thomas and his friends and you can't stop playing. If you like the genre, like some good puzzles, not hard at all, buy it no fear, trust me. Therefore, I really recommendThomas Was Aloneto your library. Enjoy it as soon as you can!"

What I enjoyed the most about this game is the feeling of accomplishment and striving of wanting to complete whatever came next and find out what came next. The creaters also did an amazing job symbolizing the levels and puzzles based of what was happening in the story. Few games have that feeling, the want to HAVE TO FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENS!!! If their was a part 2, I would definitely buy it, but this game is just fine on it's own.

Months later I returned and finished the story over a few quiet evenings.  So engaging, so rewarding.  This feels like gaming in a futuristic society where leisure time is abundant and gaming is widespread as a form of education and stimulation, instead of just addictive.  As the game progresses your mental labels of the various rectangles stops being their color or their size, and you start to identify them by name.  The game doesn't force that anthropormophization, but it's so much richer for it.  Similarly, you couldn't just listen to the narration without the context of the game and understand the story, it's a journey you take together.

If it were a tripod then the three legs it stands on would be Design, Music and Storytelling.DesignThe game is really clean and stylish, they've pushed this poshy zen minimalism that Steve Jobs  used on Apple products. Thomas Was Alone could easily be considered a lifestyle game, a building block for identity and self determination.Does it work for the game's benefit? Indeed it does, the game feels attractive, smart and easy on the eye.MusicThe music is again something that's extremely classy for a computer game. They use minimalistic melodies combined from crisp clean piano and radically electronic soundscape which kind you'd expect to find from a Björk album. In-game it kinda helps to reflect the openness of the space. A soothing experience to the ear.StorytellingThere's an amusing story to the game. The cubes, that the player controls are all different characters with their own ups and downs and their own agendas. The story is delivered by a British-sounding narrator who manages to make it humorous, personal and overall soulful.Couple of things that bugged me:- Too many too simplistic levels in the first part of the game. There were these levels where you figure out the solution in 5 seconds and then it takes 2-3 minutes to complete it, which didn't feel very rewarding.- For some reason jumps are not registered upon gentle tapping of the space button. Instead you have to smash it down quite hard.Verdict:The trouble they've gone into making the whole thing such a complete experience shows the developers seriousness and makes it easy to appreciate the hard work they've done.

It's actually really well made - rather, the look of it is purposely lo-fi. You play as a red rectangle named Thomas whose goal is to make it through a series of 2D puzzle-platforming levels. Along the way you'll also meet other colored rectangles, each with their own unique abilities and personality. And that's all I'll really say about the plot. Suffice it to say that you will be amazed at how much you'll actually care about a bunch of little rectangles. That is due in equal parts to the writing and the well-done narration that accompanies it. As for the actual gameplay, it's good, but very easy. The levels involve puzzle-solving and platforming, but neither aspect is even remotely difficult, except perhaps in a couple of spots here and there (which I would classify more as tedious than hard). So this is not a game you should buy looking for a challenge. You should buy it if you are into indie games with unique looks, story and ideas. It's a great experience, all around - a perfect casual game to while away an afternoon.

This calls for some amazingly designed and frustratingly hard levels, such as level 5.4, the second level with James. Jumping never feels impossible to do, and the different jump heights are ingrained into your mind such that you can tell from a glance ""Can Thomas make this jump?"" The different characters' abilities are excellently integrated into the level design, and you get a chance to get used to them before they're added into the usual gang. The spikes and water are simple, but add a genuine challenge that makes you legitimately tense, especially when things start moving.All of the characters that I've played upto this point (Thomas-James) have had unique abilities that are very easy to understand. No complicated ""sometimes this, sometimes that"", if you can't solve the puzzle it's completely your fault; and The way Thomas and James interact is really cool, with them both being able to essentially float in midair. Gameplay is all-around phenomenal.STORY:This is where Thomas Was Alone really fell flat. The personalities of the characters seemed forced and unnecessary, being only there to richen the storyline. After the first few levels of beating the dead horse of a new character's traits, they were never brought up again, a good example of which being Claire being a superhero. The love between Laura and Chris was completely redundant as well. I do like that there's a quote from one of the programmers involved with these AI's, especially talking about it in the past tense as a sort of clever foreshadowing, but it doesn't fix the ultimately pointless story.ART & AUDIO:The art is basic and effective. Black squares used for platforming are perfectly fine, and I feel like the game would lose alot of its charm if it changed it to something more complicated or changed the color. I really like the look of the water, and some of the shapes' jump animations are really nice. The sound effects are good, not perfect, but I do like the bitcrunched landing sound. The soundtrack is absolutely incredible, one of the best I've ever heard. It fits the mood of the level, and it's just a great thing to listen to. Usually I watch YouTube videos while playing games, but the soundtrack is just too excellent in Thomas Was Alone.OVERALL:Thomas Was Alone is a great platformer, one that doesn't need complicated art to envelop a player. The soundtrack is one of my favorites, but the story is lacking.9/10"

If you would have told me a week ago that not only would a game make me care deeply about monochromatic digital quadrilaterals, but also that said quadrilaterals would comprise one of the most enduring, memorable casts of any game this generation, I would have laughed in your face. But Thomas Was Alone pulls this off with a pitch perfect combination of excellent writing, a moody ambient soundscape, beautiful art, and a narrator that pulls everything together in a way that I've only seen rivaled in Bastion.

You control a varying number of rectangles, each with their own abilities and """"""""""personalities"""""""""" which are explained to you by a narrator as the story progresses.The problem is that the chosen method of storytelling is inefective and frankly laughable at points. Imagine a movie wherein none of the characters ever speak or carry out actions on their own. Instead, a narrator tells you what each person says and does. And the characters are blocks. Isn't there a ""show, don't tell"" principle for visual media?These shortcomings could be forgiven if the gameplay was satisfactory. It is not. For the first 75% of the ""game,"" the levels are so painfully simple that you'll feel as if the developer forgot to add challenges.

You play this game to experience a charming story about friends and how they overcome obstacles in their way. It's really amazing how the game mechanics behind the weaknesses and quirks of the characters can be so symbolic. The story can be both funny and touching, while the minimalistic visual design is pretty, and amusing narrative creates a wonderful atmosphere.The only problem I have with this game is the last part, when the story take a rather drastic change.

It's all the right amounts of clever, witty, amusing, interesting, and fun in the best combination possible.  It's challenging without being overly so, it's fun without being silly or corny, and the storyline is superb (yes, there is one, and it's amazing how the characters flesh out over the course of the thing).

Don't let the trailer or screenshots mislead you....there is MUCH more to the game then just controlling shapes.Not to mention, it's amazingly funny with very intelligent humor. I'm impressed with how clever the game is and becomes...as it goes on, it only becomes more so.I'm not even fully done with it and I can already say it's among the best games I've ever played.So if you have a few bucks to spare, I strongly suggest getting this one and giving it a try for a good 15 minutes.

The narration was enjoyable, and I mildly enjoyed the abstract storytelling of the ""AI"" quadrilaterals, but the puzzles were too simple, even tedious at times. I didn't feel like I accomplished anything through finishing this game nor getting all of the achievements (which simply required you to look a bit closer at the screen for most of them) that were scattered through the levels.The music was relaxing to listen to in the background, nothing too extravagant. However, whenever the music changed, the old music would not cease, causing a clashing between multiple songs. I'd need to reload the game in order to reset it, and it would be quite frustrating for me if I didn't do so.The story it told wasn't too bad. I thought it was humorous and unique to give each quadrilateral a personality and a goal, but the rest was too abstract for my tastes. At the later, later levels, it felt a little bit rushed however. Those who have played to that point may know what I mean.If you enjoy an easy puzzle game to kill about 3-4 hours of time while listening to a simple story through good narration, you may like the game. But personally? I was hoping for a puzzle game that required some more thinking through what I thought seemed like promising concepts, but it was a more of a story where flipping the pages required your time and tedious ""puzzle solving."" I bought this game on sale at 75% off, but for its full given price tag, I would not recommend it, nor would I recommend this game to those looking for a challenge in their puzzles that requires more than quick sight and simple action."

But with a story that even through your first time playing winds up not being too terribly interesting, and so many simple levels, the game winds up giving you a taste of fun, but only a taste. No meat, no filling meal, just an unsatisfying, tantalizing taste of what COULD be. But isn't. If you just have the cash to burn, go ahead and buy the game.

And it is also one that should be well-appreciated and respected in the games industry. This game is about AI who are trying to escape. ""Up and to the right"" is something you will hear quite often. These AIs are colorful quadrilaterals, seemingly boring in a physical aspect. However this is not a bad thing, but in fact adds to the impact of the narrative. This game shines in its narration and story which gives character and life to these quadrilaterals which you control. Not only do they have personality, but also physical variations which complement each other. Their combinations of personality and physicality produce interesting relationships which make you care about these... shapes. Yes, I just said that, this game makes you care about shapes. Their lives and goals will entertain you in more than one type of emotion.Thomas Was Alone's originality does not come only from its story, however. The audible aspect of the game is definitely significant. The narrator of the story has a very fitting voice and the music playing throughout each level and scenario fills you with awe and happiness. On the visual side, the game's very minimalist art style is very pleasing to the eyes and can sometimes surprise you with unexpected beauty.For a puzzle platformer, Thomas Was Alone is fairly easy, however certain jumps require you to jump off the absolute edge of a block which can occasionally become frustrating. The puzzles make the relationships of the characters work well, too. For example, two lovebirds have complementary abilites which allows one to do a certain task, but only if the other is present.Buy this game, you won't regret it. 8.7/10"

,Recommended,220780,9989496,"Posted: 1 May, 2014",all,"Sarrana, the Sultry Futanari","Thomas Was Alone is a wonderfully done minamalist ""adventure"" puzzle game narrated by (name escapes me) a voice many might remember from other games (I think he is in other games). While the overall game is relatively short, just 3 hours (4 if you want the collectables), you'll nonetheless have a wonderous time enjoying this game to its fullest.The game consists of you playing the role of a bunch of quadrilaterals (henceforth called shapes for easier reading) helping each other get through numerous puzzles and obstacles, normally impossible on their own, to reach the portals. Each individual shape has it's own unique characteristics that make it useful for certain situations. More importantly, they each have a personality voiced by the narrator. Each shape's personality also matches with their physical characteristics, furthering their personification. Thanks to this narrator, the entire world the shapes traverse is given life and meaning, and draws you into each level, wondering what is going to happen next.One thing that isn't done with the narrator that I felt was missing, was the narrating of each shapes' responses and reactions to the introduction to a new shape. While later in the game you'll realize that there isn't much point to this due to all the shapes, you'll feel that it is distinctively missing in the earlier levels.The controls are quite simple, consisting of nothing but left, right, jump and your shape selection. The game appears to have full controller support, though I don't have access to one so I cannot confirm this. On the keyboard you have two methods of selecting the shapes. The numbers for each individual shape (shown on the bottom right in numerical order) or the q and e keys for next and previous.The games major flaw, that appears especially on later levels when you have 5+ shapes, is that the numbers aren't responsive. To select a shape with the numbers you have to press the button numerous times or hold it down, taking you out of the game. Furthering this frustration is the shape legend on the bottom right. This legend shows each shape that is available for you to select on that level in numerical order. However, due to the colours, it is frequently hard to tell shapes in the legend apart, ending up in you pressing a number for a shape you don't want (Note: This legend is practically useless to the colourblind). Also, this legend changes all the time, so the shape that may be number one may end up be number three on a later level, never letting you memorize a single key binding for each shape.I want to mention that the un-responsiveness may have been done on purpose, as to eliminate the player's ability to exploit any jumping glitches or bugs that may become present when stacking shapes. So if you think that you need to do some really weird jumping shenanigans to get through the level, then you're doing it wrong.Let's look at the level design. Not noticeable at first, but the level design is clearly one of this game's strong points. The main method of getting smaller shapes up to higher areas is by stacking each shape and building a staircase. But when you get more and more shapes, you'll start to realize that each ledge was painstackingly measured out to require specific shapes to get up to the higher points of the level. Also important to note is that you will never get ""stuck"" and have to restart from having pushed to far with one shape. There is always a method of bringing a certain shape back to the origin, or at least to where they are necessary. If at later levels you find that you can't bring one of the larger shapes back to help the smaller shapes, then you don't actually need that larger shape to complete the level.I'm proud and happy to say that there are NO glitches, NO bugs. Everything runs smoothly and flawlessly, just like a good completed game should.Not putting too much about the ending, let's just say I'm disappointed in it. Even as short as it was and there isn't much one could have done, 2 monitors would have been a much better idea.The game is certainly not a challenge, as most of the levels you can get through without failing once. This is a game that is meant to be enjoyed, meant to be seen as fun.Pros:- Enticing narrative- Tonnes of levels- Very polished- Collectables- Very little frustration- Lots of funCons:- Keyboard shape selection not responsive- Lackluster ending- Frequently wanting a bit ""more"" from the narrativeControls 7/10Controller people might have better luck than keyboarders.Entertainment 10/10This is a game that is meant to be enjoyed, and you'll enjoy it to its fullest.Gameplay 8/10Simple, but interactive and keeps you entertained.Graphics 6/10It is a minamalist game, what do you expect?Replayability 3/10I personally won't be replaying this any time soon, just to get the collectables.Story 9/10Easily the best aspect of this game, the narration ties it all together.Average Score 7.2/10How I Actually Feel 8.5/10Definately worth your money. I still vividly remember every aspect of the game, and it is soft and fuzzy."

You do care about the characters when you play the game, and that's interesting because many games, even with the best graphics avalable on gaming hardware, have lost the art of storytelling and character development.That said, TWA is a 3-4 hour (short), simple/easy puzzle-platformer that, ironically, doesn't give a lot of closure or development to it's story. The game almost feels unfinished, it is so short, and, despite the fact I am by no means a really ""great"" gamer or anything, all of the levels are very easy, taking maximum of 2-3 tries of planning really, and then maybe 2-3 tries on execution once you've found a plan.Simply, it's highly overrated"

Simply put, it's boring, too easy, and takes itself too seriously in the narration and music.Moreover, the challenge that does appear in the game arises in odd places and in spikes of difficulty that seem out of place. For instance, the biggest chore of the game is maneuvering several of the block characters in such a way that they can jump on top of each other up to a bigger ledge. It's fine to do it once or twice, but the game has you repeating this task again and again.There are what might be called 'puzzles', but they pose almost no challenge whatsoever. Once you've solved some of these 'puzzles', the bigger challenge is getting your pieces to the end portals, which becomes tedious rather than fun.A few more semi-spoiler comments on the game design:- The final level (in section 11) is a simple maze that you navigate.- The jetpack adds some neat wrinkles in the bonus missions, but in one case you're just navigating up and down a narrow tube hitting buttons that you literally cannot miss. Other jetpack missions add a bit of difficutly, but some pieces would be difficult to navigate for the low-skill gamer this game seems to be intended for.In all, give this game a pass, no matter what price it's selling at."

,Not Recommended,220780,29236158,Posted: 13 January,all,Dravvad,"An extreme disappointment and I don't understand how it can be so ""Overwhelmingly Positive"" in reviews.I put off the game for many years after watching what the gameplay is many times. Eventually, I caved in and decided to be more open. Turns out that I should have stuck with my initial expectations.There are two main aspects to the game - the general story/narration, and the actual gameplay itself. For the story, at least of what exists, it is somewhat interesting and I definitely enjoy the narrator. Some of the things that are said are very nice and interesting, and kept me a little devoted to keep going.However, the story sort of falls apart and becomes incomprehensible around the latter half of the game. Note that the game is not that long and took me less than 4 hours to 100% it (i.e., finding those little collectibles as well). And by the end of the game, I did not really feel much connection or accomplishment with what was going on.For the second aspect of the game, it is extremely weak. The actual platforming puzzles overall turn out to be not much fun at all. While there are a few different capabilities of the rectangles you control, and a few puzzles here and there are nicely made, the majority of them follow a lot of the same, monotonous work.I would say 4 out of every 5 of the puzzles are not actually ""puzzles"" and just require meticulous, nail-biting perfection of stacking the correct rectangles in the right order, and jumping over obstacles or edges at the right time. It was killing me to keep playing by the time I finished Chapter 5, which was easily the worst with the focus on the upside down gravity and requiring very annoying angular jumps.Again, I am really surprised at the high ratings for the game. Maybe the people just give the artsy narration of AI some perfect review - but the game overall is not anything I'd recommend. It really wears down on you and loses any actual enjoyment, which is really bad for a relatively short game."

It introduces a cast of (literally) colourful characters, but then (spoilers)ditches them for a subplot with an underdeveloped, bit cheesy villain and a chase sequence, both of which ultimately go to nowhere. And the ending, even though it seems to be intended as subtle, feels underwhelming and doesn't in any way explains how the events of the game led to the dramatic events presented in the retrospective start-of-the-level quotes. Especially when coupled withthe Adam and Eve allegoryin the last level.The epilogue expands/explains the backstory of one of the characters, which, in my opinion, undermines both his/her character and initial backstory.The gameplay is functional and oscillates between fun-but-a-bit-tedious, padded and frustrating. (The latter is especially true for the jetpack levels.)On the other hand, most of the music tracks and narration are pretty good, while graphics are just gorgeous. My only complaint is that the way many, many levels are tilted grows old pretty fast and might cause a minor nausea.Bottom line: whileThomes Was Aloneisn't a particullarly bad game, I don't recommend it unless you are an indie connoisseur and want to form your own opinion on the game.

The narration sounds fine, but it's never funny or thought-provoking, and ultimately adds nothing of value to the experience. It's a stretch to say this game has puzzles - the levels are all insultingly simple and repetitive - but it's not challenging as a platformer either. The gameplay essentially involves turning your brain off and just going through the motions.You might think this game is so dead-simple it would be impossible to ♥♥♥♥ it up, but the devs found a way to massively hamper the experience anyway. When switching between characters, the order is fixed and may as well be random. The result is that every level with more than 3 characters becomes a total slog. If you want to switch to a specific character, you either have to squint at a tiny bit of UI in the far corner of the screen to figure out what button to press (and how many times to press it), or you have to blindly cycle through until you get to the character you want, which is a painfully slow process for something which should be nearly instantaneous. The obvious solution is to sort characters by their horizontal position on screen - that way, you can switch quickly and without taking your attention away from the level every couple seconds. How the devs didn't think to fix this is absolutely beyond my comprehension."

On the one hand I certainly did have fun, but on the other hand it really gets dull and the ending was cut stupidly short.This is a puzzle platformer using multiple different colored rectangles that have different ""abilities"". Some jump higher than others, some float in water, some can fit into tight spaces. What makes this game cool is the good writing that gives names and character to the rectangles as if they were people. This makes the game a bit interesting and you'll push through the puzzles just to hear the next bit of narration. They did a good job of making the characters ""interact"". Note that it is all narration and no dialogue.There are a lot of levels in this game and some of them are a lot of fun. However, some are overly simple and there seemed to be even more of them toward the end. About 3/4 of the way through the game, the mechanics will change slightly, which was a welcome thing, but it also takes away your ""characters"" and gives you new ones.  There is an ""ending"" and I will give them credit for the story leading to it properly, but all you get is a 5 second cutscene. They should have put a little more work into it.Like I said, I had some fun, but so many of the levels are simple to the point of boring. I was ready for it to be over by the last chapter. If you're curious, I'd say pick it up on sale unless you treat games like movies where you spend $10 for 2.5 hours of entertainment. Then you might be ok paying full price, but I wouldn't be.

The title is clearly an afterthought. The game has no emotional connection in any way.You navigate a bunch of rectangles around obstacles into rectangular ending ""doors."" There's a narrator but no plot. Fake, pointless love stories are made up between the rectangles. Rectangles randomly get eaten by a ""pixel cloud."" At the end two rectangles who were made up half way through the game ""escape"" and you get a five second cut scene.The music consists of three differnet 45 second loops, sometimes literally just played on top of each other in dissonance which clashes horribly. The quality of the music is good, but the length is inexcusable.There are levels where you have to move five or more (sometimes ten!) rectangles into little doors, switching between them using only left and right controls. It's hell.I've never seen a game before that only has rectangular collision but still has buggy physics. The rectangles stick to things, clip through obstacles moving in the level, and can't jump at random times.The level design is very bad. It's completely uninspired, and you're forced to repeat the same actions over and over for no reason. Often a ""zig zag"" pattern is thrown in with absolutely no purpose. You'll be forced to climb 10 stairs, instead of 1, the exact same horrible, mind numbing sequence for each stair, because why not?There are barely any puzzles. 99% of the time you're trying to figure out the least annoying way to make a staircase out of the newest randomly introduced rectangle that you dont' care about. There are no creative puzzles, which is surprising for a game in this genre. Nothing makes you think, most things only make you frustrated.The only stylistic element in this game is the light source, which is done with almost zero effort. Most levels only have one light, if any.There's a saying that if all your components are good, your product is great. Today I learned the converse. All of the components of this game are bad, and the product is awful. The quality of the narrator and music are good, but the narrator doesn't say anything meaningful and the music is very short loops.Do not buy this game."

Does this remind you of anything?This is a simple and pretty fun little platformer. You begin the game with our hero Thomas, a red rectangle with a reasonable jumping ability and a dream. As you clear levels you meet new quadrilateral characters with various abilities to help the team clear different obstacles on their journey as you switch between them during gameplay, Lost Vikings-style. Very easy for a casual gamer to simply pick up and get into. The plot is explained by the narrator at various points during each level but can easily be muted and ignored if you just want to platform for the sake of platforming.The only problems I had at any point were with moving platforms in some levels: if they move up and down too fast, it might not be possible to jump while it's in motion, or it might make you bounce a little when it peaks, which frustrated me a little in one level where timing was everything. It doesn't come up in too many situations though.Still not sure? Wait for it to go on sale, duh."

This is a game where the protagonists is a red rectangle, mind you, but it still manages to look good. Animation is smooth, even with only basic blocks and lighting the scene still has a good mood to it, and the controls are very, very easy to pick up.And, of course, the story is amazing, as enhanced by some chilling narration. By the time you finish Thomas was Alone, you'll be looking for Mike Bithell's next game (Volume, MGS-esque stealth) if only because it's using Danny Wallace as a voice actor and narrator again.

The game is of fairly decent length but there's very little reason to replay it besides getting the achievements. The characters are surprisingly deep for faceless quadrilaterals and each one has its own personality and character arc. You genuinely feel attached to them as the story goes on. My biggest problem with this game is how it ends; the third act isn't as fun as the first two and the characters aren't particularly likeable or interesting.The gameplay becomes a bit pedestrian towards the end and the puzzles feel like they're just a way to drip-feed the plot rather than give it up in one go. The final level is pretty anticlimactic but they've created some quite memorable scenes, which is no easy feat considering the visual style of the game. The voice acting is pretty good and is at its best when it is somewhat seperate from the characters; about halfway through, he does this weird inflection for one of the rectangles that's just a bit annoying. Other than that it's quite enjoyable. The music is decent and there's enough collectibles to pad out the game.

Gameplay is repetitive and the story is lackluster.STORY:Many cite the story as the strongest point in this game. I agree fully; however, the ending was very dissapointing.

The game could have ended in a good cliffhanger however, it kept going and ended in a cliffhanger anyways. But it was a very bad ending.GAMEPLAY:Conceptually, this game was insanely creative and tossed in so many beatufil mechanics that could have worked so well together. Sadly, the execution was quite lacking. Although some levels were quite nicely designed, most of them were ""get from point A to point B"" except 5 times because you have to do it for each character.

So I figured it was just an artsy fartsy project type game and which is why I haven't played it until now. But I was so wrong.In reality it is a block puzzle based platformer, so the geometry and shape of the blocks is integral to solving the problems. The voice over is just some extra sumpin sumpin to give the puzzles some context, which adds some value, but the game would be just as good without it.The only thing that I didn't like was the music.

One, there seems to be some problems with the BGM. There are 11 stages in the game and each stage has 10 levels. You wil be listening to one BGM every 10 levels and when you enter a new stage, the BGM will change to a new one. But for some reason, the BGM from the previous stage will overlap the new one that's playing. I didnt realize this until I close the game and open it, just to realize its playing 2 bgm at the same time. Some say its because of an update that caused this, but it has not been fixed yet and this game is almost 3 years old.Second, and this is just a minor thing, the menu.

It's a perfect marriage of gameplay, storytelling and music. It does everything right from its simple and intuitive controls, music that will give you an eargasm, and a compelling narrative that will leave even the coldest heart weeping uncontrollably.Visually, the game manages to make striking imagery with simple shapes and lighting that will have you grinning like a star-struck child.The story, combined with Danny Wallace's narration, is superb. Never had I thought I would be so emotionally invested in a group of geometric shapes, but that's just how fantastic and well-crafted Mike Bithell's writing is.David Housden's music does what music in a visual medium should do: tell the story audibly. It's gorgeous and never misses a beat.Thomas Was Alone is a charming, challenging, engaging and utterly terrific game that defies convention, showing how you don't have to make a game that's over 12 hours long with state-of-the-art graphics and a convoluted/poorly written plot. There is beauty in simplicity.It may be only 3 hours, but could just be the best 3 hours you might ever have with a game."

Without spoiling too much, the play styles of the different characters provides a cool challenge, by requiring  the player to remember the speed, jump height, and other components of each character’s makeup before taking action.Thomas was Alone was not a terribly hard game.  I fully completed it (all achievements) in about 6 hours.  However, the  length and challenge are not really the shining point for this game - between a clean art style, neat soundtrack, and creative story, this game feels more like playing through a storybook than a video game in many cases.  Not in a bad way, but with such a unique approach to a very regimented genre of game, Thomas was Alone really breaks boundaries of puzzle games by really weaving in a component of story.I loved this game from start to finish, and for any fellow puzzle gamers out there who are looking for a short, cute addition to their library, Thomas was Alone is a great choice.Overall rating: 9/10"

I haven't found getting shapes into their correct holes this interesting since I was  4 years old. I'm not a fan of Danny Wallace. To me, he has ridden on the coattails of Dave Gorman. But his narration in this game is great. Without him, there would be no story and none of the AI would have interesting personalities. It's.It's through the narration we find out their wants and needs. Game play = a lot of jumping. That is all you do. However, some characters can't jump that high, one can float on water, another can double jump, etc. How you deal with the characters on screen and get them to aide each other in order to reach their respective portals is what makes this game play interesting.The visuals are simplistic. Again it takes me back to childhood and creating pictures with basic shapes using sticky paper that had envelope glue on the back. I know, I'm digressing. The music was great, I can't really define it though. I'll say that it's tranquil, and possibly chiptune inspired, but I can't put a finger on the genre at all.Go and play Thomas Was Alone.

The levels are easy enough to never needing a guide to get through.You should end up really liking the little shapes and caring about their story.All achievements are easily earnable, though not necessarily earned on first playthrough.

I was immensely impressed with the idea of finding identification and empathy... in a bunch of pixels.I don't want to give a lot away on Thomas Was Alone. That would sort of defeat it's ""magic"" and ""charm"", which it has bucketloads of (courtesy of Danny Wallace, a.k.a. Shaun from Assassin's Creed), where a simple but fun platformer requiring the use of multiple blocks to solve puzzles is made all the more touching, thanks to the character and storytelling the narrator provides.I won't go into depth about EVERYTHING in this game, but I'll still remember Thomas, Claire, Laura, John, Chris, James, and Sarah and they're literally just blocks. But their abilities are so well in tune with their personalities, that you almost believe they're real characters, with real thoughts and relationships towards each other.Does the story get a little convoluted by introducing a whole new cast of characters for the third act? Yeah. Is the ""prequel"" a little cheesey? It is. But the strength of Thomas Was Alone comes from it's minimalist graphics, heavy focus on story and character, as well as it's amazing music to convey obvious emotions and thoughts from a gamer.

Thomas' story revolves around him and the friends he meets along the way. Some of his friends want nothing to do with Thomas, and others just want to be noticed. Together they discover the digital world they live in, and what lies beyond the portals.Even though it is a shorter Indie game (~5 hours and all achievements found), this was a rare instance in that even after I completed it, I wanted to keep playing it over and over again. Never has a narrator captured the personality of quadrillaterals so brilliantly, to the point where at times I found myself utterly captivated.The puzzles are appropriately challenging, without getting to the point where you want to rage quit. Because each geometric shape has it's own unique ""power"", you have to think logically on how you can get to the end of the level.Aside from a bit of a lag towards the last levels (a computer restart fixed this), I can't find anything bad or worth fixing in this game. The graphics, mood-setting soundtrack, and platforming environment are all perfect for this world. Sometimes simple is best, since too much going on or too intricate of graphics can draw away from an amazing storyline. This is one of those instances, where simple was key and the brilliance of this decision radiated through the game.All in all, this has to be one of my favorite Indie games, hands down. Sure, this game was greatly hyped about by many, many people; However this was all for good reason. With an enriching storyline and likable (and cheeky) characters, Indie gamers with an affinity for platforming and excellent storylines will be riveted. For in the end, we are all adventurers seeking a bigger and brighter world, and we (like Thomas) are never alone."

On each level you must use various shaped rectangles to solve very basic puzzles before you can advance. The puzzles although easy, are at the correct level to keep the momentum of the game moving- any more complicated and I would have found myself getting over frustrated and missing the point.I would recommend this game to any type of gamer as a unique and thoughtful and genuinely fun short game, and would definitely play it again and again."

This simple story begins with a rectangular block ""feeling alone"". While silly in the beginning, the writing is like the paint which colors the game's characters. Sooner rather than later, it'll suddenly hit you that these simple blocks might as well be the characters in a triple-A game, because whether you like it or not, video game characters are and will always be simple pixels. The difference is that one is more visually detailed than the other: everything is just dependant if the characters and dialogue are written well or not. Thomas (the block you start out with) develops a personality, and begins an adventure in which along the way he meets other blocks with varying personalities. Just stop reading and play it, because it really is worth playing!Be warned though: what I didn't like about the game is that through 70% of the game you really care for the characters and what they go through and for the last 30% of the game the main characters are instantly forgotten about and replaced with different blocks you never heard of!"

Or John, a long stick of a rectangle that jumps incredibly high. There is a total of 16 Playable AIs that each have their own abilites.

Video games are a new and exciting way to tell epic stories, or humor the audience with fun characters. It's rare, however, to see a game strike that perfect balance between gameplay and story. It's even rarer still to see a game that tells its tale with as much style and subtlety asThomas Was Alone.InThomas Was Alone, you play as Thomas. Thomas is a small red rectangle, and as the title suggests, he was alone. But during Thomas' journey through a strange and sometimes dangerous world, he meets many friends, all rectangles, each with a useful skill that will help the ever-growing team. More surprisingly, each character feels like a real, living entiity, with personality quirks and emotions. Chris feels jealous of Thomas and greatly dislikes him because he's a better jumper. James feels insecure about his ability to defy gravity and worries the others will make fun of him for it. Claire discovers she can't be harmed by water, and comes to the conclusion that she's a superhero.The characters don't talk, but are instead represented by the Narrator (voiced by Danny Wallace), who tells the player what they're thinking and saying. There are no cutscenes either; everything happens as you work your way through the puzzles. This makes for a surprisingly effective and engaging narrative, thanks in equal parts to the smart writing, the almost minimalistic visuals, a soundtrack that perfectly captures the feel of the game, and Wallace's wonderful perfomance as the Narrator.The story continues as the group makes their way to what they hope will be a bright new future, and every twist and turn unfolds at a deliberate pace as you puzzle your way through a variety of well-designed and sometimes challenging levels. I was surprised to realize, about halfway through, that I had become quite attached to these little rectangles, and that I genuinely cared about whether or not they made it to safety in the end. It's a moving story, with well-realized characters. And it's a pretty fun game, too.9 out of 10."

I think that's because most games featuring nothing but rectangles are ludicrously difficult. But that's not really why you should be here.Thomas was alone is a great example of minimalism and storytelling. It uses the excellent and very British voiceacting and narration to draw you into the events going on. It's almost like a storybook, but read out against a background of something significantly greater going on.Yeah, I've got niggles about it. At a lot of points the direction the story was going actually kind of aggravated me, but taking a step back the fact that I was invested enough to get aggravated is a point in its favor. At times, the game slowed down a bit, it doesn't seem to be terribly well optimised. And the sheer perilousness of the extra levels, while standard for bonus levels, clashed a bit with the game's overall tone.That said, Thomas Was Alone is one of those game's that's an experience. An exercise in representation and character with solid core gameplay that is enough to keep it fun and worthy of being a game instead of just an audiobook. It's not the biggest buy you'll find on here, but if it goes on sale I'd say it's totally worth a look."

If you don't, then there are probably thousands of reviews next to mine that will tell you that this is a great game. And it is a great game with a great story that I can't stop thinking about even days after I finished it.I'm going to tell you why it's a good game for kids.Oftentimes we write off games that kids can play as 'childish' but Thomas Was Alone manages something extraordinary: It's accessible. It's G-rated. As in for general audiences, as in it appeals universally to genders and age groups. It's charming, and funny, and quirky, and fun. There are no scantily-clad women and nobody gets any limbs ripped off their bodies. There's no sex and no violence. There's no swearing.What there IS is a fun platformer with a charming story that can be enjoyed as something simple, or can be enjoyed as something deep and profound. There's beautiful music, and a narrator who sounds like somebody PBS would hire to read only the finest lullabys. The gameplay itself is forgiving (thank god for no 'lives' system) while still being fun, and while the game starts off almost comically easy some levels got controller-snapping difficult for me. (Rising. Water. And then I just start swearing at the screen again.)Thomas Was Alone is a game that can be enjoyed by anyone, and doesn't come with that vague discomfort that watching a child play, say, GTA games has always caused me, no matter how much I enjoy them. Finally, a game I love that I can bring along while babysitting. A game that doesn't come with the question: ""Are you SURE your parents said it was okay for you to play this?""Any game that manages to emotionally invest me in the lives of rectangles is clearly well written. But any game that I can delight in AND share with ANYONE because of its universal appeal?What can I say? I'm impressed."

Along the way you discover that these shapes, one of whom is named Thomas, are different AI's and they are trying to find out what is happening. You deal with many types of quadrilaterals and with very different personalities. The story is quite captivating, and through the great narration you build a real connection with these AI's and each of their qualms and insecurities.The mechanics of the game run like any other puzzle platformer: you jump and move. Switching characters is relatively easy, but since it is only a two button system you may need to cycle sometimes. Also you need to keep in mind that each shape has its own ""ability."" It usually locks to 60 fps if on high setting(or might just be my rig) and on the lowest graphical setting I got 800 fps, but it looked horrible so I wouldn't reccomend it. Each background looks great and the music is fantastic, but when you fail a couple of times the music and background get boring really fast. And overall the puzzles aren't too complicated, and only two puzzles are really memorable. The only real problem gameplay wise is the wall glitch where you get stuck on moving walls, but fall off as soon as they stop.The game is fantastic to play because of the storyline and deep character connection, but gameplay wise it doesn't really break any new ground."

,Recommended,220780,7885702,"Posted: 2 December, 2013",all,Caboose,"At first glance, this game seems just like any other puzzle platformer game that uses squares a a lazy excuse to not have art direction. But it's amazing what this game turns into when you add a simple yet interesting story, an excellent narration set, and one of the best damn soundtracks I've ever heard.You follow the story of Thomas, and AI inside a network that spontaneously gains a personality. He starts to explore the levels, as he notices that they are suited to his abilities, like the world is testing him. Along the way, you meet other AIs that all have very unique personalities, and all of them relate to their abilities. There's John, an arrogant egotist who can jump higher than any other AI. There's Claire, someone who is convinced she's a superhero because of her ability to float in water. I'll leave it at that due to spoilers, but I assume you get the idea.The gameplay is also very good. Of course, like I said, it's very basic, you just move around with the arrow keys, up to jump, you know the drill. The difference here is that the jump for each character is very distinct, adding to their sense of personalities. They are well animated, and you always feel in control of the characters. The puzzles are also well designed, always giving a fair challenge, and only  in 2 levels did I feel as if the game was unfair. Trust me, you'll know them when you see them.Another interesting aspect of the game is the art style. Obviously, it doesn't look like much, but the jump animations are superb, the water looks very cool and stylized, the lighting effects in some levels are unbelievable, and it overall just looks so much better than your average flash box platformer.However, I think the highlight of the game is the sound design. The soundtrack is absolutely superb. It fits the tone perfectly, it's catchy as hell, and it always made you feel like a part of the game. The narration is also excellent, giving a hilarious British accent as the thoughts of every single character, yet somehow being able to easily distinguish between the characters, even when their names aren't mentioned.However, the game is not without faults. The first one is that it feels way too short. It's only about 4 hours long, and while it is a marvelous story, it's also pretty forgettable, and there's next to no replay value. There are no unlocks, no level designer, nothing but a 4 hour story. Another problem I noticed is that some of the puzzles take FOREVER. There are often times when you have to control 6 or 7 little rectangles at once, and trying to orient them all to jump on top of one another to finish a puzzle is not only boring, but highly tedious. There are even some parts where you have to go through a level 6 or more times with the different rectangles just to get them all to their respective portals. It honestly feels lazy, and takes a lot out of it.Overall though, the game is very damn good. While it isn't nearly long enough, I feel the puzzles are creative, the characters are unforgettable, the sound design is beautiful, it controls fairly well, and it feels like a much-needed step up from your average platformer. 8/10"

,Not Recommended,220780,9959640,"Posted: 28 April, 2014",all,Corv,"Absoluely wonderful narration, but unfortunately, that's all this game has going for it.Collision detection is finicky: moving platforms are very difficult to deal with, depending on their direction of movement. You cannot consistently jump off of a platform moving vertically, and will get stuck, in a jittery manner, if pressed against the side of a platform moving horizontally. Characters tend to slide off of one another when you attempt to stack them, and that stacking is a core mechanic of the game. This is a damning problem.I found it slightly nauseating in later, larger levels, when the camera had to sweep across large distances whenever I cycled characters, but this I cannot promise that others will experience this difficulty.More on the level of inconvenience, the levels sometimes provide no means to backtrack individual characters. That leads to a great deal of frustration if some portion of your team completes the level before another character becomes intractably stuck, forcing you to restart the level in its entirety. A separate, very small complaint is that navigating the game's menu is tied to slow animations. This would be a lesser sin, except that you only need interface with that menu when forced to restart the level, so that your frustrations pile on top of one another.Thomas Was Alone has good ideas! The properties of the characters are interesting, and the final levels that utilize them differently are worthy of further developement. As said at the start, the narration is beautiful. The gameplay, unfortunately, does not match.VERDICT: Watch a Let's Play or find the audio somewhere."

The puzzles vary from the simple ""reach the end"" type, to timed sections that often require one character to cary others and to even more creative puzzles that will challenge you to think laterally.But what makes this game the real gem that it is, is it's story-telling. The main story is told through narration that also tells individual characters thoughts at the time. There is also a 'meta-story' that is told through short pieces of text at the end of each chapter.All in all, an amazing game. Well worth every penny, even if you only play it once.

Unless you want to support indie devs to the fullest, however,get it on the cheap... full price is a *little* too much to ask.Thomas Was Alone is a well constructed jumpy-jump game where you traverse predetermined areas in order to escape and progress to the next level. While there is a puzzle element to the mechanics, it's rarely frustrating to figure out how to accomplish the tasks. The gameplay is responsive and feels just right, so rather than frustrate with harsh controls all it asks is a bit of forward thinking and a dab of experimentation. Trial and error can lead to mistakes, but it doesn't ever feel like TWA punishes you for your accidents; a quick auto-load and/or mid-stage checkpoints make for quick retries.While the title of this simple adventure is true to its word initially, you are introduced to different characters very quickly. Each character has its own uniqueness, so as the roster increases each stage relies on creating synergies and tactics that one character wouldn't have individually. Think Lost Vikings, but no combat and all platforming. Never does the roster feel overwhelming, and swapping between characters is an easy chore.It's a short game. I invested two hours and made it to the end. There's a story layered over the top, but if you were to ask me to make sense of it... I simply couldn't. It's direct in some ways, but in others it seems like high-concept art. ...Or drivel tacked on to a pure platformer. Take your pick. The upside to it is that the story is all narrated over the action by a man called Danny Wallace. His performance is delightful, emotional, and fits the tone very well. What's more there are plenty of comedic moments, and the delivery led to quite a few laugh out loud moments. I couldn't make heads or tails of the ending, but the journey was pretty awesome.Side note: If you enjoy chasing achievements (as I sometimes do), this game is great for them. There are 35 to be earned, and in that two hour span I got 31. And of the four I didn't get, one was because I didn't die enough.

,Recommended,220780,11993210,"Posted: 5 September, 2014",all,AMB 10,"Charming and inventive, Thomas Was Alone is a unique take on the standard platforming formula by having you control several different ""characters"", each with their own skills and shortcomings. What's intriguing about this game is the sheer amount of characterization. The visuals are simple, and every character is a square or rectangle of some fashion; but they're given names, colors, personalities, and behaviors that imbue them with humanity. I can't remember the last time I cared about a bunch of squares. The narration is a little long-winded in the earlier levels, but it's well-paced and delivered with emotion. The levels you encounter in the game are easy enough to not get furious over, but still complex enough to give you a pleasant ""aha"" moment when you figure them out.Is there anything I don't like about this game? Well, the controls are pretty bad. Movement is stiff, and it can be wildly confusing trying to toggle between so many different characters. Also, while the game's music is pleasant, I got an unfortunate bug that caused multiple tracks to layer over one another as the game progressed, and by the end of the game I had one hell of a cacophonous ear attack. Also, the game is short. For its price, I think the length vs quality is justifiable, but other people might not see it so. It's up to you.In all, Thomas Was Alone is a very good combat for your platforming itch. It's two hours of fun and frankly immersive storytelling, and for that, I like it."

,Recommended,220780,10698970,"Posted: 22 June, 2014",all,Snowdusk,"Thomas Was Alone is an example of a simplistic puzzle platformer done right. The game design was, well, minimalistic, but everything was presented geniusely.In the minimalism field, designers and artists alike often coined the thought ""less is more"", meaning to use a subject in its most basic elements to convey or produce a message. This game did exactly that: you will find no more than playing as rectangular characters navigating around rectangular platforms. Everything is designed in such a way, that even though an obstacle or a character is presented with basic geometry, you can at least guess its function even before the game tells you in the tutorial. That alone exhibits great game design. Further on, the philosophy behind the game is much beyond all those simple shapes and images: that is the real beauty of the game.Once I played through half of the game, it's not about plainly navigating through the puzzles anymore, it keeps turning me back to the original question: What is this simplistic world all about? Who is this rectangular guy called Thomas? Will Thomas ever stop feeling alone?Aside from that, the puzzles are eye-pleasing, the story is intriguing, and the music is well-crafted. Along with a great concept to piece everything together, Thomas Was Alone is a true masterpiece of the minimalistic genre."

I was not dissapointed.Though I haven't completed the game yet, I can give my thoughts so far.The way the story and feelings of the characters are conveyed through simple narration (which, incidentally, is excellent) is masterful, so much so that I found myself caring about coloured squares and rectangles.On top of that, the game's art style gives it an unmatched charm that is felt for every second played.  The art style is also incredibly simple and minimalistic, yet enticing at the same time.The soundtrack is beautiful as well.I was so charmed by this game that when I came across a particularly fiendish platforming section and dies quite a few time, I felt genuinely bad for getting angry at the game and the character who had to make the jumps.Oh yeah, and the actual game mechanics and gameplay are terrific too.  As of yet, I have only found one problem with this game, and it isn't even major: when a character is jumping in a direction you are holding, when you let go of the key, they stop dead in the air and drop.  This hasn't caused much trouble and could be helpful with precision platforming, but I just found it a little hard to get used to at first, because I'm used to a little momentum.Overall: 9/10.I would recommend this game to anyone and everyone.

That being said, Thomas Was Alone is a great game in almost every aspect. It's puzzle-platforming is engaging and fun, albeit not so challenging to where I ever got stuck. This, however, allowed the narrative to flow better and I personally feel that the subtexted messages behind the game were the real stars. The game doesn't offer much replayability (unless you like solving the same puzzles over and over), but there are so many different things to understand when you read into this game, and in my case it drives home the feeling that the story is what makes you attached to characters, and they don't necessarily need a face for the game to make you care about them. I was genuinely interested in the thoughts and opinions of a rectangle. All in all it took me around 4 hours to complete the game and I did it in one sitting, even obtaining every achievement on my first playthrough. It is a very fun game with an interesting plot."

A well-spoken narrator breathes life into your platforming exploits.+ Each shape has their own fun abilities to discover and employ.+ The story makes you want to move forward.+ Puzzles are pretty fair and well designed. Some head-scratchers toward the end.+ Characters are more likeable than most triple A games' character line-ups.+ Decent length and post ""campagin"" missions.+ Last couple levels really change the formula.Cons:- There's a weird sense of ""momentum"" to the cubes. Jumps can sometimes be unresponsive or fall embarissingly short if you don't get a perfect running start. LOTS of jumps are really threading the needle too.- Narration could have been kept a stronger presence in the longer puzzles.- Weird ""character"" transition for the last few levels, felt the main ""campaign"" should have ended with Thomas and friends.Fun platformer. Tests you fairly mentally and occassionally frustratingly physically. Narration is interesting, heart-felt, and fourth-wall-breakingly funny. Simplistic art style works well. Pick this up."

Starting from graphic representation - as simple, as possible, but fluid animations and clear visual language (though, as colorblind, i had trouble sometimes to match button colors to AIs) makes it outstanding and really pleasing eye. Music and narratives (latter resembles a bit Harvie Krumpet) are top notch. Heartwarming story of friendship, with good humor dose, make you willing to follow it further and further. Puzzles are in right balance, no struggling or frantic haste by solving them. GREAT GAME for any level gamer with amazingly good balance between all aspects, which contribute to game's success.

Each shape has a name, a unique characteristic and a little back story to how they started life.  For me this narration made the game so enjoyable.The level design in the game is ok, they arent particularly challenging to complete but getting to the end using the different shapes abilities is fun.  The hardest levels are generally the ones that revolve around timing and some require some trial and error but overall they are ok.The graphics are minimal but pleasant to look at and the game is well optimised, playtime is relatively short (3-4 hours) for the main game and there are a couple of additional levels to compelte after that. Overall i enjoyed the game and would recommend it especially when its on sale for less than £2.Steam Controller SupportThe game only requires 3 buttons A, RB, LB and the Analogue Stick.

The actual gameplay is a puzzle platformer where you control a number of rectangles that have differing attributes in the way they move or affect the other rectangles. What this game really has going for it is that gives you every reason to think that it will be just some simple platformer with narration but then it manages to make a simple rectangles relatable.The mechanics are simple, the graphics even more so, but the relatability is supreme.

,Recommended,220780,19384818,"Posted: 30 November, 2015",all,ABG,"Developed in 2013 by Mike Bithell, Thomas Was Alone is a simple indie puzzle platformer. A slowly stagnating genre, indie puzzle platformers are finding themselves in a place where the entire genre itself is suffering from consumers being tired of the same genre being overused by indie developers. However among the flood of low budget indie puzzle platformers on the market, Thomas Was Alone stands out as a superb example of the genre done right.The premise of the game is simple enough. You guide the character/s from platform to platform on a 2D space to get to the next area. How the game does this is what makes Thomas Was Alone standout. The characters you play as are no more than a group of differently coloured rectangles. The titular character, Thomas, is a simple red rectangle. Along the way he meets several other differently shaped and coloured rectangles, Chris, a cynical little orange square, John, a tall happy rectangle, Claire, a large blue square who can swim, Laura, a long bouncy pink rectangle and many others.None of the characters in Thomas Was Alone ""talk"" in a sense. The entire games story is narrated by Danny Wallace, whose voice acting is used to tell the story, describe the characters personalities, their relationships with the other rectangles, etc. Wallace delivers a terrific performance throughout the game, British narrators are go hand in hand with game narration it would seem. Bithell's writing deserves credit as well, not just for the development of the rectangular characters, but for the scripts itself. The dialogue is smartly written for its simple premise, going far beyong the expectations of an ordinary indie game. There are many funny and hilarious moments throughout, some sad emotional moments too. The game will make you will care about coloured rectangles simply because a British man talks about them.The terrific storytelling by Bithell along with the narration by Wallace makes Thomas Was Alone something very special. Despite being simple coloured rectangles who don't even have any lines of dialogue, the characters have a lot of personality and character development. With just lines of narration that talk about the rectangles personalities and feelings, the game makes you care about different coloured rectangles, all because they have names attached to them. The story remains fairly simple, and it could be an easy aspect of the game to criticize, but to me, it feels like the story IS the characters themselves. The story is about coloured rectangles, their character development, their relationships and conflicts with the other characters. It wouldn't have been an easy job giving coloured rectangles life and personality, but Thomas Was Alone pulls it off.All the gameplay involves is moving the rectangles from point A to point B, and yet the fact that it does so much more than just that and can tell a story at the same time is an achievement in itself. The game is a fairly short experience, only about 3-4 hours long, but it is the perfect length for the game. The stories pacing is just right, any shorter and it would have felt like a novel experience, any longer it would have outstayed its welcome.The games soundtrack is also a treat to listen to. Composed by David Housden, songs are procedurally-generated throughout the game, matching the moments in the story. The songs are simple, yet effective at matching up with the mood in every level. It's a charming soundtrack and suits the atmosphere of the game. Highly recommend buying along with the game.If Pixar were to make a game, I think that Thomas Was Alone would be the result. It's simple, funny, sad, and an emotional experience, all done with such a simple premise. You care about different coloured rectangles because a British guy talks about them a lot. The script is extremely well written, balancing those humorous and sad moments perfectly together. The soundtrack is great. In a genre that has become filled with every game playing the same way, and no innovation, Thomas Was Alone stands out as an example of how indie puzzle platformers can be so much more than characters moving from point A to B. A must have experience."

Noob (Nightmare Lyra),"While it is a cool concept to have a minimalistic puzzle platformer where you have to use a flora of different characters and have them co-operate to finish the levels, this is a pretty flawed game all in all.It is interesting how they actually manage to characterise undetailed blocks into characters indeed, though they are all 1-note characters with 1 trait. The platforming is decent, but the lack of a run button makes you slide all over the place with some frustrating falling down. The level design is creative, but often lacking in challenge, and more often than not you end up doing busy work to finish the puzzles rather than using your brain. It's also a bit confusing getting used to switching characters, as it's never set in stone what characters you will have with you on each level, and they put the visual pointer for what character you are controlling and which one is next in line right where you get popups about friends coming online and such, which is annoying.As far as puzzle platformers go it's not amazing, but it's a competely okay game for the low price, even if the game is pretty short.

There isn't anything else that I can say to explain it. from moment one when the narration kicks in and you are introduced to Thomas you are instantly intreged with the charcter and that feeling of interest in a red rectangle turns into a feeling of companionship almost as though he becomes a good friend and this happens with nearly all (if not entirely all) of the cast. If something good happens to a character you feel happy for them, if something sad happens then you feel that too becasue of the journey you are taking with them and the story you are having with them (and even the backstories of the charcters will get you in this same way).With that aside at the end of the day this is a videogame and boy. Is this a videogame. It is basically an old school Puzzle-Platformer with every member of the cast having their own unique traits such being tall and jumping high, the ability to double jump, or even the ability to cross sections that would kill the remainder of the cast. There are so many different characters in this and every one of them feel great to use and learn the tricks to. Of course to accompany the gameplay there typically needs to be a soundtrack and man. The soundtrack is beautiful. It helps to immerse you into Thomas' world and with each chapter is so appropriate to the overarching situation the cast are in.All in all this game is (as stated earlier) nothing short of amazing and I know that personally I feel that its story is leaps and bounds better than alot of the (to be brutally honest) garbage we get now. Now i will admit as of writing this i havent finished the game yet (however i am at chapter 6 of 9, not including the FREE dlc. Yes. FREE!) but i am absolutely in love with this game. There is something about the characters that gets to you and I know that I would find myself sometimes laughing and commenting about how odd it is that i care for a darned rectangle after letting a character die mid puzzle and feeling slightly more saddened.So in short. BUY THIS GAME! It is easily worth at least an extra $5 just for the crazy cast of characters alone."

The synthesis of the elements-- the superb narration and writing that made me care for these quadrilaterals, the minimalistic gorgeousness of the art style, and the moving, melancholic score-- all come together to form this beautiful piece of work.It doesn't come without its flaws, however. The mechanic for switching between the characters got tiring, especially once you have the entire crew in one level. I also did not like the latter part of the game as it felt really tacked on. The last part could've been omitted entirely and the game would have been better for it in my opinion.A couple of glitches with the game bothered me such as parts where one of my rectangles would stick to a platform and delay its descent which caused me to miss another platform I was supposed to land on and waited for it to come back. There's also the problem with sound where the music plays on top of itself which really frustrated me. Two songs playing on top of each other are fine, two different songs with contrasting moods? That's torture.All in all, this was a great game.

While the gameplay itself is simple enough to get into without too much explanation, the puzzles get increasingly more challenging as they go along.What separates this game from others in its genre is the quirky and enjoyable monologue that gives personalities to otherwise basic quadrilaterals. Thomas comes across as the one to create bonds between the various coloured shapes as you complete the puzzles, but they all have their own contributions.Even better, the game's pacing wholly depends on you, so you never feel as though the first levels are a chore, because you can level select as well as blast through the ""tutorial"" levels if you are already skilled enough at the game.

You take control of several blocks each with their own advantages and disadvantages depending on their size and jumping abilities.  The premise of this game is to overcome obstacles each level using the blocks.Narration is the biggest appeal for Thomas Was Alone in my opinion because along with a small story, personalities are attached to each block over the course of the game.  You get to learn about the blocks as if they are REAL characters and this is certainly how I felt as I progressed. I wanted to learn more about them and how they felt towards one another.  You could say I was beginning to feel a little emotionally invested too especially since I could relate to some of them.It's simple, cute, has a superb soundtrack and it just succeeds at what it does without even trying much.

Now, i can say without a doubt, this game was worth every penny.  The story, narration, platforming mechanics, ambience, and so much more was top teir, the kind that most large game firms still haven't gotten the hang of.  Although, I must admit, the puzzles did seem somewhat easy for me given that I have played games like Portal 1, Portal 2, and The Talos Principal. However, for a 2D platformer, the puzzles weren't bad at all and there are even a few head scratchers in there that I spent more time than I am willing to admit after finding the solution. Overall this game was a refreshing break from the bleak, realistic, and serious outlook most games in the market today have.  I would definently play this game again."

I find myself playing the game in short 30-40 min sessions, dreading the inevitable moment where the game comes to an end; trying to prolong my enjoyment of it for as long as I can. I don’t want this to end, yet I know it will.In the few hours it's taken me to get through the game, I've felt more engaged then I have in many 30+ hour Blockbuster titles.As I play through this I find myself really caring about what's going on, I'm eager to find out what's going to happen next; Are they going to make it? is everything going to be alright? Where is this all leading to?The puzzles are never overly intimidating or frustrating; the game has a very pleasant learning curve to it; never dropping you in the deep end. Yet it will challenge you. There will be where you will find yourself wondering how the hell your meant to get to a certain point.Now I must get to what is the real driving force for this game; the narration. Danny Wallace (voice of Shaun Hastings in the Assassins Creed Series, author of the book Yes Man and host of the British comedic documentary series How To Start Your Own Country) does a magnificent job at telling the story of Thomas & his friends.The soundtrack by composer David Housden (Monstermind) is brilliant, it delivers a lot of emotion in an otherwise sterile environment. As a fan of Ambient/Post-rock music I am intoxicated by what he has created. Subsequently, to my delight, the soundtrack has been posted alone for anyone to stream,(http://thomaswasalone.bandcamp.com)or you can even purchase the whole thing for £ 2.99As Josh Tolentino (Destructoid) said in his review of the game “It proves that you don't need tens of millions of dollars and hundreds of staff to make a game story worth telling, just a good hook, an engaging vision, and a whole lot of heart.” I believe this to be incredibly true. Thomas Was Alone has managed to do this unequivocally.My only gripe with this game is that it was sadly, too short. I wanted more, I yearned for more. It was like some wonderful dream; I didn't want it to end. Who thought playing something so simple could be so enchanting?"

That doesn't mean it isn't among the greatest. The narration brings a story like no other, and while it only takes maybe three hours to play through, whenever someone asks me what video game story is the best, there is no doubt in my mind that Thomas Was Alone is the answer. While the characters are only blocks, you feel for each character. You like some more than others. And when a certain thing happens during a level, your heart drops like no story in a movie, book, or video game has ever caused me to have. The gameplay is fluid and simple, the story is amazing, and the characters are not only likeable, they are full out lovable. Thomas Was Alone is a great quick game for anyone, no matter how old or how young."

Don't blame them, to a certain extent.The game does a nice job of introducing mechanics over the course of the game, and as far as length is concerned it doesn't overstay its welcome. What I did find is that there wasn't much that made the game feel overtaxing to complete. This works both for and against the game. I didn't feel at any point in the game that I had reached a ""oh for crying out loud let this be over already"" moment, but neither did I get many of the satisfying ""I just solved a hard one"" moments. It maintained itself at a rather casual sail-through learning curve.The narration does give these lifeless blocks some personality, but toward the end I felt that the initial characters that I was starting to get on with disappeared, and the ending leaves something to be desired. I'm not sure if this was down to not wanting to tie it up or not knowing how. Not a deal-breaker, but I was left feeling a tad let-down.Big thumbs down on controller support. Granted, I run an Xbox classic controller using XBCD, and then I convert the joypad presses to keypresses, but for some reason when I start up the game I have to do so without the controller physically connected, else it constantly reacts as though I'm pressing down or left. I spent more time trying to troubleshoot this problem, it feels, than playing the game. I do tire of games being developed without an in-built selection of controller or keyboard, instead trying to do the thinking for the player. It also now has nothing to do with deadzones, since I configured those to be EXTREMELY tolerant (I even disabled the joystick on the controller completely, but no dice, and reading on the forums I'm not the only one).Rather short playthrough, issues with the controllers, and lack of challenge put it down as a sales-only purchase. It's a shame, because the personality of the game does make me like it."

,Recommended,220780,24151466,"Posted: 7 July, 2016",all,Kayweather,"This game is simple; it's just geometric shapes overcoming little platformer challenges and puzzles with a single narrator telling their story. However, perhaps because of that simplicity it manages to deliver each of those elements in damn near perfect form.Gameplay-wise, the jumping is excellent and responsive. The characters all handle differently, but intuitively. The puzzles range from too simple to genuinely challenging, but never become fun-killingly frustrating. Overall I found the game just challenging enough to keep me feeling accomplished as I progressed, without stumping me on any levels to the point of breaking the story's momentum. That's a difficult balance to hit, but this game hit it dead on. (Though, I feel I should add as a disclaimer that I'm not....super great at platformers. It is a possibility that more experienced puzzle-platformer players might find the game too easy overall. Even with my limited skills I found the puzzles pretty obvious more often than not.)The story is what makes this game come alive, though. The writing and the narrator make these simple shapes absolutely burst with personality. I loved pretty much all of the characters, even the more incidental ones, and soon found myself deeply invested in the victories, tragedies, and love lives of a bunch of quadrilaterals. Admittedly there were a couple of points the plot lost me  (namely,I never really understood why being eaten by the cloud made it impossible for Thomas and the others to escape, when it seemed like they were just seperated and moved. Like I'm still very unclear on why they had to sacrifice themselves, even if the scenes leading up to that sacrifice were written beautifully.). The story is just as carefully balanced as the gameplay, giving the player elements of humor, despair, love, and hope in perfect proportion.Overall this is a game that surprised me. I wasn't expecting such a polished experience wearing such a simple aesthetic. I'd definitely recommend anyone give it a shot (and in fact I loved it so much I've already purchased a copy for my best friend.) Even if you can't justify the full price (which I think it's worth on the merits of its narration alone) thendefinitelysnap it up next time it's on sale."

I expected that this would be a simple sort of platformer, and that wasn't really right on multiple levels. First off, there's a nice, natural way that it adds abilities, and so it gets more complex as the game progresses. There's only a few levels that are difficult enough that they really take a lot of time to solve, but there's enough variables that levels never felt repetitive, and it makes for a good few hours of playing, most of which is relaxing. For simplistic mechanics, I think the game also has a very polished look about it.The part that I really was impressed by, though, is how strong the story is. That's right, it's a platformer with a bunch of rectangles that has compelling story. Or at a minimum, compelling characterization. It's all done in narration for the characters thoughts, but it's a testament to the writing that it creates that much character.

It's been on my radar for quite some time, but only this steam sale did I finally decide to pick it up and play through the game. What greeted me was something quite... Unexpected. I had no real idea what I was getting into aside from shapes and platforming puzzles, but the narrative, sound design and colourful (quite literally) cast of characters kept me invested through my three hour play time.The gameplay of Thomas Was Alone is simple. Each level, you will start with a set amount of rectangle/square shapes of different colours and you use them to move throughout the environment to portals at the end of each level. Each shape has it's own portal to get to and all shapes must touch the portals at the same time to move on. Each of the shapes have unique characteristics and personalities. For example, the red rectangle, Thomas, is a hero who's got average jump height. Then there's the orange square Chris who can't jump as high. John is a yellow rectangle with a massive jump height and the rest of the cast adds more to the mix (Swimming, Bouncing, Double Jump and reversed gravity).Each of these new power ups are easy to understand, hard to master. But lucky for you guys, the difficulty in this game doesn't go too steep. Very rarely did I find myself using the restart level function. There are ten main chapters of the story, segregated into 10 levels per chapter. On top of that there are two bonus chapters featuring another character, Benjamin, who uses a jetpack to fly through the levels. The jetpack mechanic takes a lot of getting used to and doesn't handle very well, it made these extra chapters an absolute slog to play through, but the story kept me going.So let's discuss the story in minor detail. Thomas is an AI that becomes self-aware of his environment. We get little quotes at the beginning of chapters detailing the events of the game as historic events. Thomas is apparently known as an ""Architect"" and the seven shapes you encounter throughout Chapters 1-8 are important in this regard. The characters are all fun and memorable from the miserable Chris, the Wonder-woman Claire, the frantic Sarah and the sinister Gray!This game isn't perfect though. The final chapter feels extremely rushed from a narrative standpoint. It tries to tie up loose ends a little too quickly and some characters literally just drop of the face of the earth, like they were never relevant. The puzzles do get more difficult, yet the difficulty spike of the game is very much a rollercoaster. Some levels are easy to cruise through, others not so much.But overall, this is a game I would very much recommend. If you haven't already, pick up this game and give it a shot, you might find yourself caring about these little coloured shapes afterall.~ Billybo10K"

Each shape has a special ability (except Chris, poor Chris): Thomas jumps high; Claire swims; Laura is a trampoline; etc. The level organization does a near-perfect job of introducing the shapes, letting you use them, and familiarizing you with their abilities with the group. The group completes a puzzle when each one reaches their goal: a white portal specific to each shape. The variability with the portal locations and the shape mechanics creates interesting and challenging puzzles.Did I mention the narrator? Other than quotes shown at the beginning of each chapter that explain a major AI malfunction, he's responsible for progressing the story. And he's wonderful. He shares the shapes' thoughts as they meet each other, judge each other, fall in love, pretend to be superheroes, and everything in between. These shapes have better character development than I've seen in AAA games.I do have a few quibbles. Alternating between the shapes isn't consistent. Some of the cooperative mechanics between shapes were cumbersome, which is fine for one puzzle. When you require that solution for multiple puzzles, it gets repetitive and frustrating.

I want to reccomend the game for the beginning, but the ending just never does it.In addition, as much as I hate to trash a story-based game for its gameplay, however it IS the foundation to the core game.  The gameplay can get annoying and resulted in me having to turn off and come back later.  What's wrong with it?  In the beginning of the game only two characters are introduced, and the only controls that are TOLD to you is to press Q or E to swap between them.  This can get annoying because the other of the characters can change, and just scrolling through them can leave you on the wrong one.  When the character count increases to 5, 6, 7?!!  You cannot play this way, and I learned that each character, when loaded to the level, is assigned a number and you can select the character through that number.  The other problem, none of these are labeled.  So I had many times where I thought a character was one number, then had to AGAIN, scroll through numbers to get the one I want.  When some levels are time-based, this is not fun, and I smash the game for it so much because it would be fixed BY JUST LABELING THE CHARACTERS.But yeah, it's a good game."

,Recommended,220780,32093196,Posted: 31 May,all,SupremeS,"“Minimalist” is a term that can be interpreted in a bunch of different ways. A lot of the time it’s all about a lack of material possessions, keeping only what you really need to live a good life. At other points it’s the absence of complicated visuals; the presence of something that is simple yet appealing to look at, with no sharp corners or brash colours to distract the eye. Or sometimes it can go to the extreme, as is the case with Thomas Was Alone; a game that’s mad enough to consist of nothing but simple lines and rectangles.I’m honestly not kidding – that’s pretty much all that’s on show here. Apart from a few subtle lighting effects working away in the background, this is very much a textbook example of what you see is what you get. Yet the overwhelming simplicity of this world isn’t as bad as you might be coming to expect; what really matters here is how the story builds up what this world and its inhabitants represents.You see, this is a tale of AI programming becoming self-aware, and via some brilliant and funny narration by Danny Wallace (Whose works you should check out, by the way!), each little AI block you control is given their own distinct personality. The main character of Thomas, for one, is naturally inquisitive and logical. Others you meet along the way have their own unique traits; there's a deeply cynical square, an arrogant yet caring tall rectangle, and another bigger square that has delusions of being a super hero... On and on it goes, with new faces appearing all the time. It's done to such a level that as the plot moves along you actually start to care for each of them in a weird little way. It's never to the extent that you're going to shed a tear for their plight, but it’s enough to keep you engaged with them throughout their journey – even though they’re just little coloured shapes. It’s ingeniously done.So your gang of crazy characters is set up, but what exactly are you doing with them? Puzzle platforming, that’s what. It’s up to you to switch between all of them, using their unique abilities to navigate through each level, and getting everyone to their respective exits. That’s it. If anything, the gameplay is as minimalist as the art style – but again, that’s by no means a bad thing. Thomas Was Alone’s main strength when it comes to its gameplay is in the way its difficulty and pacing is second to none. Each and every level presents a challenge that is both not so hilariously simple that you can cruise through it in two seconds, but also never hard enough to create a situation where your progress comes to a screeching halt. The game also introduces new ideas and character abilities at a steady rate, keeping things fresh and entertaining, but never at a pace where everything feels overwhelming.The process of actually navigating your way through each of these challenges, however, is where the cracks begin to show. For one, the act of switching characters is cumbersome, requiring you to cycle through all of them in turn to reach the one you actually desire, the camera trying to zip towards every character in turn at an almost nauseating pace. This isn’t too bad when there’s only three shapes to control, but when there’s six or seven, the endless cycling can start to infuriate somewhat. Couple that with a soundtrack that I found so incredibly annoying I proactively sought out the sound settings just to turn it down, and you can perhaps see how the blood pressure can slowly start to rise.There are a few other minor factors that also don’t help. The jumping mechanic, for one, feels at points oddly heavy and stiff, creating situations where I felt I wasn’t fully in control of where my jump was going – with a missed jump often wiping out a hefty chunk of progress in an instant. The level design at points also didn‘t help my mood, and really dents into what is otherwise flawless pacing – you can complete the bulk of some levels, only to realise you need to backtrack and do something with a character near its beginning.Perhaps I’m just rubbish, but whether you attribute these problems down to poor play or not, they still lead to situations with feel unnecessarily annoying. All these minor niggles created a situation whereupon, once I realised I was nearing the end of the story, I was quietly hoping it would hurry up and end already, just so I didn’t have to put up with another inconvenience. Considering the game itself is only three hours long, however, and… Well, you can perhaps see why that might be a bit of a problem.Thomas was Alone is far from perfect, then, but that doesn’t mean it’s inherently bad. It’s still perfectly playable, and the charming narration and story do a lot to help plaster over the faults that might rear their ugly head as you move along. It’s a fine example of how much you can do with so very little, and also stands as a perfect counterpoint against the sheer flood of lazily made indie games with tiny budgets that flood the market every day. So don’t be a square – check this out."

I love how different ""levels"" actually represent some states in life, some feelings, I love how much humanity these little blocks have and how much your imagination can do with so simple concept, so simple pixel-art graphics. Good job Bithell Games and Danny Wallace, you did fantastic.The gameplay is a pretty simple puzzle platformer adventure. Basically every character has different traits/abilities that balance somehow - that gives interesting experience and puzzles are based around these traits/abilitiesas you can fe: jump higher but you are taller so you can't fit anywhere, only one block can swim but it can't jump high etc. Even though TWA is very repetetive from time to time, it gives a good challenge.The ""falling down and up to shimmy-shammy your way over the whole map by jumping or moving two (reverse gravities) characters in the same direction"" mechanic is pure awesome, First time I did it I was actually amazed it worked like that lol.

You play as various rectangles of different colors and abilities, and many times you have to find ways to combine the abilities of multiple rectangles to make it across various obstacles. There's some great and quirky story-telling, too, about what all the rectangles are doing together. As a platformer, most levels are pretty straightforward, but a few of them provide distinct challenges. Other platformers would have all these abilities present in a single character, but by having each character represent exactly one ability (e.g. swimming or double-jump), you have to think in slightly more creative ways to get around problems, particularly as not all the abilities are always available to you. It's definitely a fun and silly way to spend a few hours. :)"

However, in this age of every new game being a ♥♥♥♥ing 250 hour directionless sandbox with weak characters and narrative, I view that as a very welcome change. Thomas Was Alone is a puzzle platformer on the surface, but in my opinion the story is what you will really play the game for. The narrator is excellent, the monologues well written, and the characters are lovable, despite having no real dialogue of their own and only being a series of different colored squares. Each of your little friends has a well-realized personality of their own that matchs their shape and unique ability.The gameplay is very simple: move your colored squares to their corresponding hole at the end of each map. Each character has different attributes. John, for example, can move fast and jump very high, whereas Claire is slow and can barely jump at all, but she is the only one that can go into water without dieing. Chris, meanwhile, harbors bitter resentment of everyone else because he recognizes that he is just dead weight that needs to be ushered across each level on their shoulders. The puzzles are not difficult at all, but since I believe that the story is what really drives the experience, I think that is also a virtue - it ensures that you don't get stuck on any level and thus, you don't have to hear the narration repeated over and over and the story flows at a steady pace. Despite being easy, many of the puzzles are still satisfying just because of the cleverness of the mechanics, like exploiting the opposing gravitational orientation of two characters to use them as platforms for eachother.Thomas Was Alone has very very few problems worth noting. There are a couple of bugs that you MIGHT encounter that prevent progress, but since they are repeatable they are easily avoidable. After playing for about 2 hours I began to experience a significant drop in framerate for unknown reasons but restarting the game solved that issue. It can be a bit difficult to keep track of all of the characters by the end of the game, especially since the final 4 characters are all introduced at the same time, are all the same color and you don't get much time to get to know them.I completed Thomas Was Alone in about 3 hours, including the ""prequel"" bonus missions and all of the achievements. Then I went to bed. Then I woke up and played the entire game a second time. I just had to hear the music and the story again. I don't think you can give a game any higher praise than that."

TWA is a side-scrolling puzzle-platformer that guides players through a story about several artificial intelligences that have become self aware.  The game starts out with Thomas, having his ""thoughts"" explained through a pleasant, well spoken narrator.Along the way, Thomas comes across other shapes like him, but that have different attributes, which add the element of puzzle to the game.  For example, one character is very tall and can jump high, while another is short enough to get in small spaces, but can't jump as well.  Throughout the game, the narrator is telling us what the shapes are thinking.  What I find interesting is how in depth the narrator makes them out to be, when in reality, there isn't really a need for it.  That being said, it's one of the reasons I love this game.The controls are tight, default with keyboard being space to jump, 'q' and 'e' to change characters, and arrow keys to move left and right.

It's an endearing mixture of a simple puzzle game that had the option to become frustratingly complicated but wisely decided not to, the writing and narration, and the wonderful soundtrack. People who wish for more complicated challenges need to realise this game isn't about that. It's not the trial and error type thing like INK for example, you're not supposed to border ragequitting.There were like three or four levels where I struggled and I could've punched my screen listening to the same bit of dialogue every time.The puzzles serve the story not the other way around which is why if you don't care about the story you won't care for this game.The writing and narration are stellar to the point where I began to play the rectangles according to their personalities, like the ~meaner ones would go first over a gap, and when given the chance to help another character, it'd always be the ~nicer ones to do so even if more of them had the capability to.The soundtrack gave the whole game a more epic, more heavy tone that I really appreciated but I understand if it's not everyone's cuppa. For me this game was a wonderful experience and I'll surely be recommending it to others and replaying it. If you accept that this game is story and atmosphere first and difficulty second, you'll have a great time."

The platforming was fun and simple, a variety of characters with a variety of abilities keeping the stages interesting. None of the levels ever felt too difficult or unfair.  My only downside with the platforming was the tedious nature of moving a character that does not jump high. This was annoying especially over large stretches of high platforms, where I had to repeatedly create staircases with my larger rectangles to get my smaller rectangle to the goal point.What really sold the game to me  were the unique personalities given to each rectangle. Each character really felt like an individual, sold by the wonderful narration and fun character traits. I felt like I found something to identify with each character. I would recommend this platformer to anyone looking for a few hours of engaging entertainment and wanting to get emotional over rectangles."

The one negative point I can make on this game is the fact that, at times, some of the levels are stretched by repetitive jump patterns that make frustrate you if you don't take your time and try to rush the levels (which the game encourage you not to do, anyways) Overrall, I highly recommend it, especially if you catch it in a steam sale :D"

,Recommended,220780,33703821,Posted: 21 July,all,Madou,"Thomas was alone is a game about teamwork and acceptance. Through its puzzle platforming, you meet many characters, including the titular character, Thomas (He doesn't stay alone for very long), Chris, and John. Though they are just squares and rectangles, most of them have some character, explained through a narrarator.The main gameplay of Thomas was alone is, as I mentioned, puzzle platforming. To complete a level, you need to get each character into its respective box. This is where the puzzles come in. First you just need to deal with Thomas. That part is easy enough, just get the red rectangle into the rectangular box! Then Chris gets introduced. Chris is a cube, and can't jump as high as Thomas, so Thomas has to act as a stepping stool so Chris can get to the next platform. Chris isn't just a deadweight though, he can squeeze into small spaces and click switches. Each character has something special about them. John can jump super high, Claire can swim, and Laura is like a trampoline! Each character is unique in their own way, and that Aha! moment, when you figure out how to use each character's quirks to solve a puzzle is very satisfying.Besides the gameplay, the story is pretty solid as well. The general gist of the plot is that all the quadrilaterals are AI's in a simulation. They weren't supposed to have two AI's in one simulation; as the game says: ""That changed everything"".Each of the characters in the story has a very distinct personality. Thomas is happy and enjoys working as a team. Chris is grumpy but learns to accept his friends. John loves to perform in front of an audience and loves his ability to jump high. For a game about squares and retangles, there is a surprising amount of character development.My highlight of Thomas was alone is in the chapter called ""Design"". This is where you play as all of the characters up until now. I really felt the strengths and weaknesses of each character, and how they helped each other.My verdict on Thomas was alone is overwhelmingly positive. The visuals are great, the music is immersive, and all of the lines that the narrarator says are constantly adding to the character and ""soul"" of the game. I'd go as far as to call this game a masterpiece. 10/10"

I went in almost blind expecting some kind of difficult platformer a la Meat Boy, but got a charming little puzzle game instead. I couldn't help but get wrapped up in this little world of artificial intelligences, each with their own personality, struggles, and quirks. While I didn't cry, the ""twist"" in the plot was unexpected and made me feel things for what are essentially ""only"" colored bits of pixels.Controls are functional, but could have been a little tighter here and there. While I didn't run into many issues, the timing of some jumps may be frustrating to some people.The game isn't very long, clocking in at only a few hours playtime, but with how huge my ""stack of shame"" is getting, I consider the short length a plus. Achievements were also a breeze and can all be completed on the first play-through, or easily gone back to from the level select.Overall I consider it a solid game and a great example of what someone like me wants from an indie game.

Braid, Jason Roher, Rod Humble, Stanley Parable, Gone Home, Brendon Chung, Dear Esther, Fez, Cart Life, Glitch Hikers, The Talos Principle, and on and on. I usually afford these games plenty of patience so they can get their message across and explore their characters to a level that AAA games might gloss over. However, after spending 2 hours playing to level 5.8, presumedly a third of the game, I felt quite unsatisfied. The platforming puzzles are far from interesting. That's mostly a limitation of each character's minimalist abilities since unlike a half life game, there are only so many interesting or challenging variations of the mechanic that can be shown. At times the game resorts to dexterity based challenges like Super Meat Boy. Unfortunately, it lacks the responsiveness of other platforming games. Very often my jumps would not register. Unimaginative puzzles and poor response make for bad platforming.Thus the platforming serves only as a delivery vehicle for plot and character development. Except narrative is delivered at a rate of one sentence per level. Sometimes that can be fine too. Bioshock or Fallout 4 can successfully delivery narrative in between chunks of repetitive and unimaginative gun fights. But unlike those games, I don't see the appeal to the plot.By level 5.8, some half dozen characters have been introduced, each given about 5 lines worth of exposition, mostly about their angst towards each other. There's as much depth to the story so far as the number of edges each character possess. Maybe I'm being harsh by expecting more from quadrilaterals. Other people seem to think there is a valuable message from this game. I just wish I could have read the dialogue off the back of a cereal box instead of spending the time I did."

,Not Recommended,220780,35384451,Posted: 1 October,all,Arkan01d,"I want to like this game, but I don't. I had heard about Thomas Was Alone, but never considered purchasing it until I played Subsurface Circular. I enjoyed that game so much it made me look into the developer's other games.I know that Subsurface Circular and Thomas Was Alone are two very different gameplay style games. But I do enjoy a good platformer. I was raised on Mario and Mega Man on the NES; so I picked this up and dove in head first.First off, the platforming is IMO off. You can't jump, land, jump, what's up with that? You have to jump, land, wait 0.5 sec, jump. THIS totally throws off the gameplay for me! I was on one level where Thomas needed to jump over a few water traps. The platforms where placed so all I had to do was jump and move. Unfortunately the delay in jump, land, wait 0.5 sec, jump, made me die multiple times. I had to jump, land, wait, jump. This game had taken out the fluid movements of a normal platformer.There is also a bug where, when jumping off Laura, when you land on a platform, you can't move until you jump again. Also sometimes you bounce when you land and other times you don't. When platforms are moving, you can't jump, why not?!?This all compounded to one level for me.I made it until 4.10 where you have to jump on a moving platform, it pushes you up, you fly in the air and bounce, then you need to wait that 0.5 sec to jump to another platform that is moving away from you. I couldn't make it. That 0.5 sec delay was making the jump impossible. I tried for 15 minutes. I tried bouncing, landing, moving, and jumping. I tried moving to the very edge of the ledge, bouncing, landing, waiting 0.5 sec, jumping. I tried to use coye time to get an extra pixel of space, but I just couldn't make that jump. The irritation of the broken platform mechanics culminated to that one jump and everytime I missed it made each and every negative more glaring.Why delay the jump ability? What was the developer intending by breaking it's core mechanic? This is only made more obvious because the story is so solid. You're not playing the game for the platforming puzzles, you're playing for the story. But the platforming is the vehicle to get to the good story; so make sure your vehicle is tip top. Subsurface Circular avoided this all together and quite frankly I think it was a boon to the game."
