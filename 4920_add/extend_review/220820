My fav mode to play is Slaughter (survival) where the zombies keep coming which also has an online scoreboard to challenge your friends. Story mode is repetitive and gets pretty boring; there is a lot of content for the money though! Blood Racing is OK but most enjoyable once you get a good ride. Decent array of weaponry & cars to choose from which are all upgradable (off course :p).http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=188479432I created a section in the guide above which has a quick list of what you get in the DLCs. Also covers things like the vehicles, game modes etc which might be helpful if you still want to get a better feel for the game.Definitely good value, a few weak points short of a classic but overall a solid, fun game!Worth checking out if you like top-down racing games.If you enjoyed reading this review, please followTrue Blue Reviewsfor more recommendations!"
,Recommended,220820,32267669,Posted: 8 June,all,bad_rain,"I've played the original edition few years ago. I can only recall that it wasn't really a good game - mediocre at best.Now, seeing the HD remaster at low price (sale, around 1€) promising better campaign, new features... Well, why not?Zombie Driver is an arcade vehicular-combat game. There's a campaign, that will take you around 6 hours to complete. Also, racing mode, survival mode and lots of achievements. The problem is, it's all a bit underwhelming. Zombie Driver never becomes anything more than a brainless, ultra-violent, mildly engaging arcade game. It's entertaining in short bursts, but falls to make a lasting impression. I must admit, as a stress relief - it could work (If you're into turning hundreds of zombies into red paste :)).I failed to find major changes in comparison to the original release (Boss fights? Tedious.). Good thing is, the game runs pretty smooth on almost everything, managing a steady 60fps even on low-end laptops.Is it worth it? Well, if you can get it on sale, around 1-3€.Don't waste your money on the DLCs. Additional cars are OP, making the game a complete cakewalk."

Mixed with the proper metal this game's survival mode is a great stress reliever. Plus, it throws out achievements like candy making you feel like even more of a rock star.

,Recommended,220820,9373258,"Posted: 7 March, 2014",all,CorvusCorax,"Zombie Driver is the same for the top-down car racing games as Zombie Shooter is for the isometric style action-RPGs: mindless fun offering you hours and hours of entertainment while ridding the world of a horde of zombies!You play as a taxi driver who is entrusted by the government to complete certain tasks during a zombie outbreak. The story is nothing special but some of these missions can be very exciting - sometimes you can use a tank to just destroy everything that's in your path but even with the taxi cab mowing down hordes of zombies can prove to be satisfying.While story mode can get really boring (you should mainly play it for the money) Survival Mode puts you in a much smaller area and makes you the target of never ending zombie waves. The longer you can survive the higher score you can achieve and you can compete with your friends on the leardboards.Furthermore, in Blood Race you have the opportunity to compete against other drivers controlled by the A.I.This game offers long-lasting, solid fun! You have machine gun, rocket launcher, flame thrower and even a rail gun at your disposal to wreak havoc!This is a highly recommended game!"

Its a great little mish mash of genres to create something a little bit different and it works. It even has boss fights too.It also has a racing career mode too and the races are kinda nuts really as you try stay in front, kill zombies and win to earn more money to buy better cars, upgrades and weapons.The only real con to the game so far is the poor voice acting but then I didnt buy this for the voice acting or immersion really. I just wanted a fun little game to go between other games that didnt require me to amass an encyclopedias worth of knowledge about builds, techniques startegies etc but would let me rip loose and feel like a boss. This game does that.It aint no FORZA but then you don't get to kill zombies in FORZA. brought it on sale - totally worth the money.---- edit --- and still loving it a few weeks later.

Regardless of the surpriseless storyline I managed to spent hours shooting and smashing zombies wave after wave until I got enough of the slaughter. Fun lasted easily the main storyline though.There is also 2 other game modes. Worth mentioning is the Blood Race where player can compete with another racers with different rules and scenarios - a GREAT shame that multiplayer is not an option and all you compete with is a load of AI.I'd purchase this from sales if I were you but if you really are into some arcade rumble rather sooner you can't go wrong with this.

,Recommended,220820,33850768,Posted: 28 July,all,Sweep,"About Zombie Driver HDIn ZDHD, you are Joe Citizen who, for reasons unknown and never really explained, has been recruited by the military to conduct a series of combat, scouting, and search-and-rescue missions. The first ten or so story missions of Zombie Driver HD were fun and the last twenty-one generally vacillated somewhere between tedium and entertainment, with a couple of teeth-grinding exceptions. Most of the components of a good game are here, but none of them stand out in any way, which makes the whole more-or-less precisely the sum of its parts: a mediocre story, weak voice-acting, decent but not remarkable gameplay, nice car models and destructible terrain, and some value-added game modes.Release Date: 17 Oct, 2012The MissionsYour missions start with briefings, like the one shown above, after which you select a vehicle and buy any upgrades that you can afford based on what you’ve unlocked so far and how much cash you’ve earned from completing objectives or finding money stashes. ZDHD is one of those top-down games where you never get out of your car. The variety of vehicles, ranging from your starter car, a taxicab, to a giant armored vehicle with a 10-passenger capacity, is fairly impressive, but when you dig into the game you’ll find that you’re really only using one or two of the vehicles in your garage, generally a compromise between carrying capacity (most of your missions involve rescuing scientists, first responders, or civilians with special skills such as pilots) and durability.The StoryWhat story there is in the campaign unfolds largely through the mission briefings and monologues by survivors that you pick up and bring back to base. No explanation for what caused this breakout of zombie-ism is forthcoming although it’s evidently some kind of bio-toxin, and the military has you picking up various groups of folks to assist in containment and control efforts. Many of these groups will question (as you, the player, no doubt will) why the military is sending a lone, untrained civilian to perform these dangerous tasks and some will hint that the military is somehow behind the zombie plague, but whether these are the ravings of a paranoid few or glimpses of the truth is never made clear.ConclusionIf you like top-down driving games and hate zombies, you may enjoyZombie Driver HD. It’s not a great game but it’s not a terrible game and that’s about the best faint praise I can give it.8/10 From MeSweep"

You've either got a machine gun, a flamethrower, a rocket launcher or a railgun mounted on your car. You even can choose your vehicle, e.g. a taxi, a sports car and not at last a tank in story mode. Beside the story mode, which is not that challenging, there is a racing called Blood Race and a survival mode called Slaughter. All of those are fun and the game itself is just about fun, it is certainly not a high-class game. Despite the variety of three playable modes, the game is rather short. Nonetheless it is worth buying, especially on sale."

There are also three different play modes: story campaign, rampage racing, and slaughter survival mode which makes for a nice variety depending on what sort of mood you are in.  And there are plenty of achievements to unlock for each mode.I, personally, had some difficulty getting used to the controls, but the game itself runs very smoothly (I have a low to mid range gaming PC).

I'm looking forward to trying race mode later.I always have a nostalgic hankering for a decent top down driving game but am usually disappointed. Zombie Driver HD however is fantastic fun..   Rich environments much of which you can destroy, engaging story, awesome voice acting (in the best B movie tradition), convincing hoards that can swamp you if you're careless, great explosive visual effects, quality audio and HUGE zombie bodycounts.While you are required to develop a certain amount of driving skill it should'nt be too frustrating for novices of the top down style. missions can be completed at a slower pace, sticking to the streets but don't worry about leaving the road, the maps are sensibly designed so you don't constantly get stuck on scenery or in dead ends. As you become skilled with the handbrake you'll be pulling donuts and rail gunning through hundreds of bloody undead.The different vehicles work well and purchaseable upgrades mean you're always tempted to stray from the mission to grab extra cash found around the city.The atmosphere created in the game is great, weather changes, night time lighting, the army presence, shadows of jet fighters roaring overhead, vehicle getting covered in blood and a constant tension created by time critical mission elements all add the feel of this great little game.One thing I would like added is the ability to move the camera a little to scan the environment. Playing with an xbox controller this seems untuitively what the second stick should be used for, although it's arguable that you shouldn't be able to see much further than the street you're driving in.So in my opinion the developers have done a great job of creating a top down driving game set in a zombie apocalypse, if that sounds like something you need, you should probably grab it in a sale like I did, or at full price if you're feeling flush.FUN."

There are some modes where you have to compete for speed, but the zombies are still there and have to be slaughtered under your wheels! Excellently gruesome sound effects, suitably bloody and realistic graphics and hard, pounding music to keep you driving. The physics feel cool.

76561198038132122,Recommended,220820,32346710,Posted: 11 June,all,ForestWolf,"Rating: mediocre (5/10)IntroductionZombie Driver is a top-down racing & shooting game in a modern setting with zombie invasion. You mostly get missions to either rescue someone, destroy or deliver something, while shooting or ramming tons of zombies on the way.Gameplay & Story: 4/10The story is quite simple, as it is with most zombie influenced games. The devs tried to implement some story ""twists"" but they are too obvious, so that it is quite clear how the game gonna end right early in the beginning. The story is told by mission descriptions that you receive and some minor dialogs with survivors. The gameplay is quite simple - select a car fitting the missions, fulfill the objectives and try to get secondary objective for some extra cash. The more zombies you destroy on the way, the more bonus cash you will get. Besides the story mode the game offers some survival and tournaments against KI.Combat & Challenge : 5/10Playing this game casually I did not encounter any serious challange, neither in story mode nor in tournament or survival. It is quite easy to finish the game in short time aswell win every race in tournament mode and reach golden medals in survival. The combat in Zombie Driver is consisting of mostly holding two butons down - firing your weapon and driving forward, well, with steering left and right from time to time. The weapons have limited ammo but once you upgrade them, it becomes really easy to finish the objectives on almost any car.Graphic & Interface : 4/10The graphics are nothing special, but do fit the game style. There are not many details to look at, mostly you just watch a red/green mass of squashed zombies. The interface is simplistic aswell, just showing you the most needed information to fulfill your mission.Progress & Mini-Games : 5/10Progress is fairly quick and simple in this game. Since it does not take long to finish the game, you wont get bored to also enjoy some tournaments or try yourself in the survival. Tournament mode receives some extra points for having different race types (destruction, race, time survival, etc.). This delivers a nice change to the game.Audio & Immersion : 5/10The weapon sound and music fit the game, are nothing special though. It is nice that they voice the mission description and dialogs, give a bit better immersion in the game. The world does feel apocalyptic especialy in later stages of the game, but it clearly does not let you dive too deep in the city of Zombie Driver.Side-NotesThis game is single player only.This game contains steam achievements and trade cards.This game offers none to minimal replayability. Survival is the only mode that would attract playing it again.This game offers some minor rankings for tournament and survival modes where you can compare your times and scores to other players.This game is fairly short - it took me 10 hours playtime to finish the story, all tournaments and get golden medal on all survival maps.SummaryZombie Driver can be considered a casual top-down zombie shooter, even if you race in a car instead of running. You will get fairly quick through the story and other modes, so even though the game is nothing special, you most like wont get bored in the short time invested.I hope this review helps you making the decision if its worth buying this game. Rate and leave a comment if you enjoyed reading it.~ForestWolf"

I say flaw because if this game was multiplayer, I am pretty confident none of us would ever play another game ever again except this one. Explosions, endless bullet spray, flames...flames at the corner of my brain, fodder, more flames and a laser which basically just punches a hole through an entire city block. Now all that control in one mans hands is fun, place it in three, have a timer and endless enemy spawns and you have a pixelated armageddon catering for an endless maniacal laughter.2) There is a scientific equation law here which is never broken. The equation is this... Zombie + Speeding Car = Tomato Sauce. Problem is not everyone likes tomato sauce. Some like Bbq, others go for mayonaise, some like wasabi and some boring people dont want any sauce at all. Since the developer/s do not want to limit their audience they should really provide an option in game where you can either change color of sauce, or even have the option of 'no sauce'.Maybe modders can come to the developers rescue on the second point since the game has been completely opened up for them to run mayhem. Personally i like to place several sauces at the same time on my fodder, so give me white, red, green, in fact even make a rainbow sauce please so i can really paint the town.Basically the story mode is rather linear in the way it plays out like carmageddon, so that you run over various zombies picking up people from various locations in the city. Each time you pick someone up you get treated to a small dialogue of the story which more often than not pokes a bit of fun at itself and the zombie game genre providing some laugh out loud moments. But it does become a bit stale after a while because most of the levels are basically the same thing over and over. You just grind away making money so you can buy more cars and upgrades.Most of the zombies really do the same thing, they just cause your car's health meter to go down when they hit it while your standing still or if they throw a projectile at it. It doesnt take much intelligence to find the zombie spawn points which are usually a converted zombie bus, or a massive zombie hive and blow it up first. There is one zombie which really is a major pain though and thats the fat zombie, which is somewhat parroted from the 'boomer' in 'left for dead' if he gets close enough to your car he will explode causing massive health damage to your car if your still within his blast radius.The HD graphics in this game are TRULY AMAZING. I found myself a number of times just parking and looking at the beauty around the place regardless to the fact that I was being pounded into the concrete. I just had to look at the houses and green houses and go 'isnt that pretty, go away zombie leave me alone i'm admiring this flowering bush'...The other grand mention of this game are the two other modes. This is where the game REALLY shines.First there is a Slaughter mode where its your job to last as long as possible driving around a small map collecting upgrades and money as the waves of zombie spawns slowly get worse each round. There is an achievement to last for 30 waves. This is really challenging and more often than not personally found that my car was exploding into tiny debri even around wave 10. Place this mode in multiplayer and it would be awesome.Second there is a tournament mode. The tournament caters three events.1) Blood race. Race around a track against challenging ai racers poling for first position.2) Endurance mode. Race around a track by yourself, trying to hit the checkpoints in time against a devilish timer.3) Elimination mode. Race and blow up as many AI cars as possible.Again if all this was in multiplayer it would bring back the feeling of the good old days of 'rock and roll racing' google it.Seriously enjoyed the graphics and the fun of the modes, just really, really wish it was multi player and could turn off that damn red color and change it to pretty rainbows. Still recommend, but if you don't like tomato sauce I would give this one a miss until modders or devs give more options.Finally here is an interesting video which shows the evolution behind Zombie Driver HD so far...https://youtu.be/a-wNhKdML38Also this is a video of me playing the only level I could not get gold on to show how challenging it is, maybe you can show me how it is done?

Causing a lovely accident that has turned the inhabitants of an entire city into shambling aggressive Zombies. Which of course you are asked to kill as many as you can while doing missions for the military.Game play: What can I say. Its top downish drive shoot and ram to kill zombies, while doing missions. All good ol fun if you like killing zombies.The Graphics: They are simple and good enough in my view for the game. But for those who are picky and want things looking really like real life then this would probably effect them. But for this game I say its just right.Controls: Controls are simple nothing to hard to learn. SWAD for movement LMB for shooting and RMB for Nitro. Petty simple there is other combos for the the controls as well as game pad. But I just stuck with the Keyboard n mouse. Still fun with them.The Music: It does go nice with the game. It even had the feel of some older games, the names escape me at this point though. It certainly fits the style of game.The Reply Value: With the other game styles you can get and the dlc. There is some reply value in it. Plus am sure the any zombie killing lover will reply it a lot.Bugs/Glitches: I could not see any bugs or glitches that could effect my game play of this game. But remember that's not saying that they might pop up for others. But for me none what so ever.Overall: Its a fun zombie killing game, with some nice graphics that suit the game. Easy to use controls, music that go's with the game in my view. Certainly has reply for those zombie killing lovers. No bugs or glitches that I can see. Story was to me generic, but that's me. So in my view this is a nice game to play. So I give it a 7 out of 10."

You are a talented driver (I guess) and you are recruited to help out the army as they try to evaculate or establish a base. Missions are fun, fast and filled with satisfying gibbing of zombies everywhere. Typical mission is going to pick up a few specific survivors to help build the base (Doctors, Shipcrew, etc) or going to defend a specific objective. There are secondary objectives, and the game does a good job of mixing up the mission objectives.Simply put, this is a great game to sit back and relax with, slamming into a billion zombies. I have only played the Campaign so far, but there is two additional modes to the game! Really excited to dive in further.

And the problem of driving game is that most of the time they gets boring real fast. I like that game, the music is good, the graphics are pleasant enough but there are lacks of variety. You just spent 90% of your time to go pick some guys up or to destroy something. That's the main problem of the game. Another problem is the scrolling speed. When you pick a fast car and if you use turbo it is going too fast and you don't see well what you're doing and where you're going.However, I still find this game fun.

,Recommended,220820,31930605,Posted: 24 May,all,『 科学のTetøra 』Shikaco,"TL;DR DOWN BELOWI find this game fun. And that is what's important; it is fun. Mowing down countless zombies for minutes on end is a great way to pass the time, especially with the game's straightforward run over and shoot mechanics. While other games such as Civ V or Stardew may eat your time away just as much (or perhaps more), those games need the player to think rather heavily, To some of us, having to use our heads can be a deterent into enjoying something. This is where Zombie Driver shines, it is a game of pure, mind numbing fun.That being said, its base price tag of $8-10~ isn't really justified, considering that I can spend  just as much for other titles that have more interesting gameplay mechanics, better writing, and better visuals while being capable of maintaining the same amount of enjoyment I can get from Zombie Driver. The game's current price is a bit too much for me, it feels like a $5 game even with the ""Complete Edition"" (which only adds in two maps for its ""Slaughter"" mode, a racing game mode, and some really lackluster car customization additions).Zombie Driver's most glaring issues are its lack of a free roam mode, shallow car customization (both gameplay upgrades and aesthetic options), and while it isnt really the focus of the game, -its writing. I really wish this game had free roam. Its Slaughter mode is kind of there but it's not enough as it limits you with getting a high score until your car is destroyed. This affects its replayability but not so much that I would turn my head away from this game. As the game progresses, the zombies get more and more harder to kill and thus an upgrade system was added but all the upgrades and car options seem so pointless and feels like padding when I ended up only using the Auroch truck with full upgrades due to its high health bar and stable handling. With the latter being almost crucial with all the cramped corners in the sub-urban areas. I tried my best in paying attention to the storyline but it was so generic and badly written that I ended up skipping dialogue to just go on ahead and play.I recommend this game. past that whole paragraph I just wrote, I still think the game is nice. But only if it's on sale. (I got its complete edition for more or less a dollar).TL;DR :Zombie Driver is fun at its purest form. it just has a price tag that you'd be better off spending on something more justified for $10. That, and its lacking car customization, story, and no free-roam. But don't let that stop you from getting it with even the smallest of price reductions."

I didn't expect much from a game where you just drive around the whole time, but through fitting audio, brutal animations, powerful weapons, massive zombie doom-bringing tanks, and fast paced action, this game makes mass zombie squishing extremely satisfying. ""Slaughter"", a wave-based survival mode, brings all of the weapons to your disposal early on, like the super powerful railgun, making normally repetitive zombie smashing very enjoyable."
,Recommended,220820,25233512,"Posted: 29 August, 2016",all,GeoLuz 🎮💯👊🤙,"The title of this game basically tells you all you need to know about the gameplay: run over zombies with your selected vehicle. You run over zombies or kill them with weapons attached to the vehicle while completing primary and secondary objectives in the story mode.The story mode has a basic plot that is very typical for zombie based games, not ground breaking. It looks like another apocalypse. Your mission begins with a briefing from General Blofeld that you must clear out an area filled with zombies or rescue certain people who are being overwhelmed by zombies. As you go about your mission, you run over zombies while your vehicle gets covered in blood and earn combo bonuses. These combo bonuses continue to multiply if you continue to mow down zombies in a bloody mess, something like chaining your matches in Audiosurf. The top-down perspective looks like the first 2 Grand Theft Auto games and the action looks like the Carmageddon series since you are constantly causing a bloody good time around town.The weapons are scattered around town and all are pretty useful. They include flamethrowers, machine guns, railguns, rocket launchers, and nitro. All weapons can be upgraded using the cash you earn from each mission completed. The nitro really speeds up your car and helps you reach your destination faster, but it is also useful in getting out of a tight situation when being overwhelmed by large numbers of pedestrians that could potentially make your car explode.Vehicles are varied and range from taxis to buses. Some vehicles are more useful than others in some missions. The military may ask you to rescue 8 people in a given mission, so the best vehicle could be the bus because it has a carrying capacity of 48 people. All vehicles can be upgraded for more speed and better ramming ability. Even with the variety of weapons at your disposal, ramming zombies with power slides and using nitro to go full speed ahead is still more common than shooting.The zombies range from regular zombies to exploding zombies. The regular zombies are small or medium in size and there are many zombie dogs run over. The real challenge comes in the form of exploding zombies. Exploding zombies are the fat zombies who can detonate themselves when they get near your vehicle. You can be earning great combos while killing 300+ zombies, only to be ruined by a group of 3-4 exploding zombies who commit suicide next to your vehicle, causing it to explode.There are a few bosses to battle in the game. These bosses can only be defeated with enough firepower using the various weapons in town. It is also necessary to use defense by running away from them when they are ready to attack. A lack of defensive moves will lead to certain death. In addition, the zombies will never leave you alone during boss battles. So, while you are running away to restock ammo the zombies are chasing you. When you are firing away at the bosses the zombies are still attacking you.There are other modes in the game that add to the zombie splattering fun. There is the blood race mode and the slaughter mode. The blood race mode is about tournaments that require you to compete in different events such as races, eliminator, and endurance and have bronze, silver, and gold medals available. Races require you to finish 1st for gold and you can destroy vehicles by ramming them or with your weapons. Eliminator events require you to cause as many wrecks as possible while going through checkpoints to increase the time remaining. Endurance events require you to drive around with a bomb stuck to your vehicle going through checkpoints to increase the time remaining. The trick in Endurance events is to kill zombies and destroy as many objects as possible to contribute to the time remaining. The slaughter mode is a good old fashioned zombie killing, splattering entertainment. It is all about killing as many zombies as possible from one wave to the next until your vehicle explodes.The graphics are decent and, while not dazzling, they provide a well-detailed environment. The death animations look cool and make you feel like it is so much fun making your vehicle all red in blood and guts. You can hear the zombies writhe in pain very loudly when you splatter them all over your vehicle or when you blow them away with your weapons.The vehicles handle well, as the physics feel realistic during the times you have to turn and perform power slides. They also feel realistic according to the type of vehicle. The muscle car feels very fast whereas the bus feels slow, but very powerful for ramming zombies. The super car feels like it is both fast and powerful since it combines all the great attributes of speed and power.Some may be disappointed by the fact the Zombie Driver HD has no multiplayer. True, there is more replay value after playing the story mode because of the blood race and slaughter modes. However, those who love multiplayer action will not have any opportunity to compete in multiplayer mode.I think Zombie Driver HD is a lot of fun to play. The story mode feels a little bit short in length, but it is still entertaining enough. The blood race and slaughter modes provide more entertainment and replay value for a low price of $9.99. All the zombie crushing and splattering fun makes this game worth your purchase.My Score: 7.5/10"

However, everything in the game is against you.  When driving, you have to collect fuel, health and ammo, but you don't know where to find these meaning you run out of fuel or ammo, or your health does down and you die.  You can either try and rescue the survivors but with not enough fuel, or you can try and find fuel but then there is not enough time remaining to rescue the survivors.  Some of the zombie groups must have hundreds of zombies in, and even with a tough car, you car easily gets damaged.  Then there are super zombies who will damage your car even further, and even throw objects at your car!  At least make the zombies realistic, not super thinking toughened zombies who will seek out objects to throw at your car!  The graphics are awesome as very detailed, and in theory this is a good game, but in practice it is awful.  You end up keep being killed which puts you off playing the game any more."

There is only 3 upgrades that you can get, and frankly they don't even make that much of a difference when you upgrade your cars. All weapons suck♥♥♥♥♥except for the railgun, which is supposed to be the final ultimate weapon. There is not much of a variety in the type of missions you're doing because on paper, there'll be only 3 or 4 of them, each time containing the thing you've probably done before, so there is not much to surprise the player with. I don't understand why ""zombie's"" are in the name either, because they're more of an obstacle that only serve to slow your car down instead of being a threat. Developers are trying so hard to hold all of the fun back instead of going complete bonkers and tossing tons of upgrades, weapons and enemy types on you. All that is left in gameplay is just going from point A to point B while clicking the mouse button from time to time, expecting something different from the game that'll never happen. That is how bad the gameplay is. There are millions upon billions of better arcade games out there, just start running and don't look back upon this pile of misery they call a game. RUN! RUN!!!!!!"

Basically you're a survivor in the Zombie Apocalypse.  The city streets have thousands of Zombies roaming around.  You are a civilian, you start with a basic car that can run over zombies.  You earn money doing missions, which you can use to upgrade your vehicles with higher powered Machine guns, flame throwers, rocket launchers ect.  The game is not open world, but mission based.  You have to rescue people from these areas before they are killed by the zombies, so on a time limit.  Some are more open missions where you need to make it to different supply points clear the area of zombies, then get the supplies.  Or some missions are just to clear a zombie outbreak and survive.The game is a top down style.  Controls are straight forward.  There are power ups located across the map for Car repairs, or ammo for your different weapons.  But Ammo doesn't stack.  If you just loaded up your rocket launcher, then picked up ammo for your machine gun, your vehicle switches to Machine guns, and your rockets disappear.As for the story line.  I wish they got rid of the military.  Would be alot better story if you were with a small handful of useless survivors.  Instead you have a fully functioning military base.  They have tanks, Choppers hovering above the base to secure it from any zombies coming to your camp.  There are survival critical missions to save certain doctors, engineers needed for the bases survival ect.  But instead of getting out the tanks, or flying over to the boarded up houses with a chopper and mowing down everything in site, they send the lone civilian in a sports car with limited weapons.  Eventually they will start letting you get some military vehicles.All in all, lots of fun to play, lots of action and mass zombie deaths.  Big explosions and Blood smeared all over the city."

The car spins and disorients you in an unrealistic manner; it takes a moment to reacquaint yourself with the direction you WAS going in and the direction you are now facing.

It's too bad, because in the hands of a real game company that knows how to make a real game, this could have been great.

Then you back up, reposition, line up, hit the brakes, turn around, speed up, reposition more and ♥♥♥♥-all else to get more shots off in a straight line before quickly having to do all that again.There are a ton of other problems with the game but it really isn't worth my time talking about it in detail.

Looked like a fun game of destruction and mayhem, but in reality it's not that fun after a while.There are only 4 guns that you upgrade with cash earned from kills/missions, but you can only use one at a time and have to pick another powerup to use the others. There is a combo counter on killing enemies, but said guns don't seem to contribute to it (unless the combo is already going?). The gameplay consists mainly of carefully drifting around the map, mowing down zombies with clunky controls and a locked player camera. You barely use your guns for any other purpose than shooting at a crowd of story objective targets or shooting at bigger enemies when they start appearing between big zombie hordes. It would be nice to be able to destroy the sturdier walls, too.There is a lack of control for aiming your weapons and handling the car (blood race mode especially), so I don't recommend the game."

Racing mode was fun (single player only). i didnt try the arena mode. Story mode has zero variety, but thats forgivable i guess, you drive around killing zombies and pick up powerups and upgrade your car. the thing that makes me NOT recommend - is that i break out into cold sweats from getting dizzy while driving. i think this may be due to the camera... if i played this for an hour i think i would throw up and need to lie down. i dont know - that may be just me... but other top down games like Nation Red or Gatling Gears, did not make me feel this way. too bad. it had some things going for it. maybe playing a mission once in a while or playing a race when waiting for a download or something would be cool. i also liked that it had full controller support, thats always nice to have in a game. But overall - if you are sensitive to cameras spinning without your input- i would avoid.EDIT: OK i went back and tried 1 more mission - with the 3rd and last camera option.... Free Camera mode is a little better. And the game threw a Defend this Area type mission... but its still made me dizzy a bit. I think the camera is too close and has to adjust itself too often since you can be driving quite fast. so yea.... i still would not really recommend."

This game is dirt cheap even at 10€. The story mode is well thought out, voiced, filled with multiple giant maps and a wide variety of different missions. On top of the pretty extensive story mode there are a ton of challenges, zombie killing combo modes and even races! The death races are crazy fun and brutally hard and those alone will keep you busy for quite a while. What's even more incredible is that for that small price tag, you don't only get a game jam packed with content, it actually looks really damn good too!

The gameplay is alright, run over zombies, burn them, shoot them, etc....and then there's the hassle of rescuing survivors.  If this had a star system, I'd give it 2.  Graphics are fair, gamplay is ok, but the controls are crap.  Maybe this is better with a controller.  Glad I got it on sale, would not buy again."

However my new laptop has a Nvidia Optimus chipset (Intel + Nvidia).  If i launch the game with the integrated Intel HD4600 it start and runs, but cannot keep up.  If i launch with the Nvidia card I get the configuration utility which only shows the Intel HD4600, if i try to launch I get a Microsoft Visual C++ error.There have been multiple threads about the issue, i have tried all possible solutions but no luck.  This has to do with the video card (and the fact the configuration utility cannot even choose my Nvidia card).  My setup works on all 40 of my other steam games without a problem (even tried the Nvidia on Monkey Island, a little overkill but it still works).The game itself is fun an brillant, however due to the fact no one with the Nvidia Optimus can get any support from the game developers i would not purchase this game (there was just an update in August so the game is far from abandoned).  If they fix the game i will change my recommendation.  However seeing as though i cannot play it i would not recommend to anyone else to purchase."

The controlls make the car hard to manuver, amn near impossible to kill anything with, and overall, it simply feels broken.I figured, then, with the story mode being lackluster, I could probably get some enjoyment out of the Arena mode. Locked in an arena with a near endless supply of zombies. Just you can your car to fight them all off... Sounds good, right?Just as boring.

The gameplay feels like a mixture of GTA1, Twisted Metal and Left 4 Dead. In story mode you get to kill countless zombies by running them over with your vehicle and with whatever weapons you pick up to complete objectives, unlock more vehicles, and upgrades for your weapons and cars. There's two other modes to play as well: Slaughter (survival) and Blood Race.If this sounds like a mindless game to you, well...it is. But Zombie Driver is really fun in my opinion, and a nice little game to waste a few (or several) hours on. It's also noteworthy that HD made the story mode longer and better as well, with new features like zombie spawns, bosses and new vehicles you get to drive. 4.0/5.0"

I liked the tropical map, in fact, the graphics overall were wonderful! Some levels felt like they were designed to punish you for even trying to beat the challenges set up for you.

Various maps you can unlock based on doing well in previous ones+new cars to unlock via the 3 modes and a score board leads to an addictive ""Beat your/friends high score"" mentality of old school games.I only have less than an hour on the PC version  (picked it up for $3.74 on sale) but I have 20+ hours on the xbox one version (paid $15 and don't regret it).The game runs well on my potato so no complaints there.Fun way to kill time/hilarious game to watch via broadcasts."

It seems that driving over thousands of zombies and watching them splatter with full blood and gore effects never gets old! This game offers you just that. The gameplay is the core of this game, as all you get to do is kill zombies (Thousands of them), save survivors and cause mayhem. It's fairly arcade-like, so it's fun for a few minutes at a time. The graphics are not that great, but the game makes you look over it with the amount of blood and gore it throws at you on the screen. It pretty much is a top-down version of Carmageddon, so if you have played the old classic, you're gonna love this. For owners of the old Zombie Driver, this game is some what of a rip off as it doesn't offer you much in comparison - But at a nice discount it's well worth it."

,Recommended,220820,14703014,"Posted: 28 February, 2015",all,ShaggyMoose,"Bottom line:An enjoyable and attractive, if somewhat frustrating, top-down driving game in the vein of the original GTA games. Has less complex missions, however spices things up with seriously large hordes of zombies to brutalise with heavy weapons!Pros:Video and audio are generally pleasing. The maps and vehicles have a lot of gritty detail and weather and lighting effects are put to good use. The particle and gore effects are suitably over-the-top and make firing rockets into zombie mobs a very satisfying experience.Multiple game modes provide a great amount of content for the price and also offer a variety of experiences. This is a good thing, because the story missions generally feel much the same. In particular, I found the Slaughter mode (arena) to be challenging and required both tactical and strategic thinking to reach round 20 and beyond. Racing includes a variety of different events, in which the aim is either racing, destroying opponents, or driving as far as possible with a bomb attached to your car! Sadly, I found all modes spoiled more often that not by the difficulty in identifying ""hard"" obstacles and the unpredictable handling of the vehicles during collisions.Weapon variety is decent and effective, but fairly uninspired. Power-ups are all incremental improvements until the last level, where power is doubled. Specialisation usually plays second fiddle to whatever happens to be lying around your general vicinity at the time.No crashes in the ten or so hours spent in game (Windows 8).Cons:Unpredictable behaviour when hitting walls and other obstructions; sometimes you bounce, sometimes you stop dead, sometimes you instantly spin 180 degrees. A little frustrating in the main game, immensely frustrating in the race events! Came close to rage quitting a few times in this mode... Apart from this, the controls are fine (used M&KB).What ""story"" there is remains utterly predictable throughout and voice acting is excruciating. I am sure its tongue in cheek, but its still horrible.Performance drops and wavers noticeably once there are alotof zombies on the screen. This is mainly an issue in arena mode, where huge hordes are a common occurence. This is on an i5 3570K with an AMD 6950.DLC:Mostly forgettable...The included vehicles are overpowered and spoil the progression of the story mode a little.If you are still looking for more of the sameaftercompleting the game, you won't be disappointed with the additional race and arena maps. If you are expecting something different, don't bother."

I believe the devs did it on purpose! So bad it's funny and adds to the game.The bosses are kinda cool, the race and survival modes didn't change much.The new vehicles for special missions are amazing and I wish they were available in a separate mode (specially the tank and the fire engine).Overal 8/10 would squash zombies again"

The campaign varies with enough objectives to avoid being boring and onces that finished you can replay it or play; Race & Suvivor mode for a variety of challenges.The real neat thing is that you can choose one of many cars you have to unlock by completing the missions.

I only have about two hours put in to it, but that's certanily enough time to figure out what this game is all about. Picture a mashup of the early Grand Theft Auto titles and your run of the mill zombie destruction game.That really sums it up, but being able to upgrade your car and play around with different weapons is interesting. You will find yourself rolling around, running things over, and picking up health a good bit (or maybe I'm just bad at the game and tend to play recklessly.)It's not something I can see myself sticking with through endgame, but it IS a fun time waster for those who are looking for something to fill the slot while they decide which next big AAA title they want to go after. I'm a big fan of indie games for this reason, they usually have a simple purpose, are easy to play, and offer enough challenges to stay interesting. We're at a point now that they can no longer espouse graphical beauty as an aid to actual gameplay or ""fun factor"" - graphics just don't make a game more fun. A game can be beautiful to an extreme degree and still be boring. This, however, is not boring. It's fast paced, interesting, and an oddity in the world of indie games in that it stands out by being a unique combination of largely overdone concepts.Easily a 9/10, and definitely playable and enjoyable in small doses. You aren't, however, likely to pour 80 hours of your life in to it."

Don't yell at me for what follows hahaPros:-Driving controls pretty tight-drifting is fun but I never really used it-graphics are super pretty for a game world you just speed through-visceral, gross, bloody, zombie fun completely as advertised-tank, truck, and one firefighter mission are cool and should have been more numerousCons:-you'll probably never upgrade more than 1 vehicle to max because they just get better as you find more so the bus and supercar are the only things you need in the end-VERY samey and repetitive missions that involve going to a circle and shooting the 2-3 zombie spawners nearby then mindlessly gunning down the remaining zombies.-you always have acess to all unlocked weapons, so there is no sense speciallizing in one set of upgrades-WAY TOO MANY BOMB ZOMBIES TOWARDS THE END, felt like I had to follow the speed limits not to hit them and lose the whole mission from doing the one thing the game is designed for...PLOWING DOWN ZOMBIES WITH MY MURDERCAR!-Weapons only face forwards so bossfights mostly just involve standing there firing, then driving to the health pickup a thousand times.-At the end of a mission, regardless of difficulty, distance, or health remaining you have to drive back to base which is pointless if you aren't rescuing anyone because the next mission just sends you out again immediately.-MY BIGGEST PROBLEM: as long as zombies wander into the mission zones, they aren't complete, so you may have to spend minutes just waiting for zombies to stop wandering from the world into the mission area so you can continue, and there's always the chance you'll pull more if you drive out to kill them. I know the point of the game is to kill zombies, but if you play this for more than an hour straight it becomes more about the missions than the zombies, which feel like more of an inconvenience than a fun challenge.Summary:I had fun with the first 2 hours of my 7 hour playtime, but once you've done one of the two truck and two tank missions, you've seen everything the game has to offer minus a few hours of driving and cleaning zombie guts off the windshield...P.S.

,Recommended,220820,31905719,Posted: 22 May,all,Indurok,"Video version of this review:http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=930965579This game begins with an explosion of some chemical plant that turns people into zombies, and your character escapes in a taxi car. Does this guy work for the taxi company, or did he just steal it because it was the closest means of escape? I don’t know, but who cares? The point is, you are hired by the military to mow down zombies, rescue survivors, and upgrade your vehicle.With each zombie you kill, you earn money, which you use to purchase upgrades for your car. You can also get money by picking it up off the ground, or completing the secondary missions. You get multiple different upgrades for your vehicles, like weapons and abilities. Each car has different stats, such as how far upgraded the abilities are when you get the vehicle, as well as how many passengers that particular vehicle can carry. So you better choose wisely for your next mission.There are some vehicles you can drive but you cannot unlock, because you can only drive them on certain missions, like a truck, a tank, a bulldozer, and a firetruck. Unfortunately, these vehicles cannot be upgraded with weapons and abilities, so you’re gonna need to keep an eye out for health. I really love the tank, because you got the big gun, which is great for destroying clusters of zombies.And of course, like any other zombie video game, there are different kinds of zombies. The regular walkers, who apparently can throw stuff at you. Rude! And there are some bigger guys who are stronger, and more difficult to run over. It’s best to use your boost on these guys because they actually slow your car down. And what would a zombie game be without an exploding zombie? I don’t think I need to explain these ones. They just explode when you get near them. And the dogs go without saying. They just run at you and attack, and are faster than the human zombies.You also have to fight bosses as well; giant mutant creatures that throw goo at you, spray toxic... blood or whatever at you, and are extremely ugly.The game is a ton of fun... when you’re not constantly driving straight into an exploding zombie. It’s probably just because I suck at video game driving, but after a while, it just gets kinda ridiculous. And there seem to be times when health can be scarce, most likely because I’ve just been looking in the wrong places. But honestly, I’ve driven for several blocks through alleyways, and not seen a speck of health when I desperately need it. And it’s kind of annoying when you hit something and your vehicle ends up spinning out of control. It tends to turn me the opposite direction of where I want to go, or flip me on my side, and I have to respawn in a place where I’m surrounded by zombies who kill me instantly because of my LOW HEALTH!I was a little disappointed with the ending. I don’t know if this counts as a spoiler, because characters have been talking about it throughout the entire game. Plus, it’s kinda something pretty much anyone would half expect from a zombie game. They keep saying the military is up to something, but I don’t remember seeing anything indicating what or why.But all of my problems aside, this is actually a good game, and I totally recommend you check it out."

Its basically a top down shooter, zombie squisher with objectives and a silly but fun story line to keep things progressing in a certain direction.  Neither story nor game play are going to win any big awards but the game is a fun/mindless way to blow some time when your bored.  The story mode consists of various compartmentalized events that contain objectives, like rescue and recon missions.  You do these missions one at a time, meaning that you get your orders, go to the car customization screen to choose and upgrade your vehicle and then do the mission.  When the mission is over, you repeat the sequence for the next mission.  As you might expect, the missions become more difficult as the game progresses.  There are two other modes of game play for this game but I havent played them yet so I cant comment on them.  Ive only played a bit of the story mode.  I would imagine that one of the other modes of play involve a ""hold out"" mode where you survive as long as you can and kill as many zombies as possible during that time period.  I forget what the other mode is.  So yeah, for what this game is and what it costs, you cant go wrong by adding it to your library.  Just dont expect this ""game"" to reflect real life in anyway like one of the reviewers I read who thinks that its unrealistic that the Army doesnt just take care of all the problems.  Guess he thinks it breaks the immersion?  immersion in this game? Really??   Besides, if the army took care of all the problems in the game then what exactly would the player have to do?"

I have not played this with a controller yet, but I will have to give it a go, because using the keyboard and mouse does not really work for me. This game is fun and has excellent voice acting, no real complaints about this game. I got it cheap on a STEAM sale, so it was worth every penny."

,Recommended,220820,31489753,Posted: 1 May,all,Fr3derik,"Top Down format Racing (kill the zombies) game. You can choose if playing the Campaign, the Slaughter or Blood Race modes. Now the first one in few words is just a storyline, kill the boss, unlock other cars. The Slaughter mode is the ""survival"" side of the game, making you running around, smashing  hordes of nasty zombies and upgrading your weapons. The Blood Race mode instead is the one that really makes the game enjoyable most, infact you'll be facing zombies while racing, ramming and shooting other  cars. Win the race, make money, buy new and more powerfull cars and upgrade your weapons is the concept of this mode. Single player only but a game that promises ""brutal races and hours of fun""!PS: Everything you read in here is a personal statement, coming from my point of view and maybe not reflecting what the game itself looks like."
,Recommended,220820,31324364,Posted: 23 April,all,lorenas41,I must say that i didnt have many expectations for this game. I really enjoy playing this game and it is very well build. But it is not a 10$ game for sure. The campaign is very repetitive and it hasn't got much content. I purchased it for only 1$ and i wouldn't pay more than 5$. If you find it in a low price defenetely lower than 5$ then you should buy it. It is a game with great challenge and fun wich will entertain almost anyone.

There are three modes, all of which are worth a go, and for as hilariously b-movie the story is, it kept my attention throughout, with various unlocks and rewards becoming available. I would recommend this game based on its playability alone. I found only one problem with it, as it chugged at the end of the level at times and crashed three times during my playthrough."

I can whole-heartedly recommend this game to those who like a bit (or a lot) of mindless zombie killing and don't mind the top-down camera angle(s).On the technical side, it is really ipmressive how much sh!t can be on the screen at once without the game stuttering or seemingly even dropping any frames and I don't nearly have a powerhouse system.So all-in-all I think it's fully worth the 10€ or if you can catch it on a sale like me, you can even get it for under 2 bucks which is a no-brainerpun intended."

,Recommended,220820,31404621,Posted: 27 April,all,BurnoutGT45,"Zombie Driver HDWhat a name. A name like that makes a game sound so generic and dull, yet this one is tons of fun. It's basically 3 games in one, in the sense that some mechanics are shared between them but the rules are quite different, like Kirby Air Ride. On that note, let's start with...Story ModeThe story of Zombie Driver HD involves a chemical outbreakbecause some pharmaceutical company wanted to find a cure for cancerthat turns most of the population into zombies (obviously) except for one man in a taxi, who ends up working with the military to help save as many people as possible. Ok, now that the synopsis is out of the way, this mode is the weakest one in my opinion. The mission variety is pretty good, with a couple boss fights and some special vehicle missions (the tank ones are a blast) breaking up the monotony of having to drive to ANOTHER location across the city to rescue people. It's not like the rescue missions are bad, it's just that most of the story mode is rescuing people and it can get repetitive after a while. The story, though, is so cliché it drags things down.The moment the cat scratches you in Mission 19, I knew the story was going to end with a zombie reveal jump scare. By the way, the military was using you the whole time so they didn't have to do any dirty work themselves. Nuke the city, leave no trace, did no work, pretend nothing happened, how original. /sTLDR:Mostly fun missions and bosses, lame and predictable story. I score it 3 bad voice acting jobs out of 5.Blood Race ModeThis mode is practically Twisted Metal meets Burnout, but top down. For what was originally a free update for the original game, Blood Race is pretty great. It's not just races either; Elimination events are basically deathmatch races (as crazy as that sounds, it actually works) and Endurance events are where the zombies really get involved, where you have to try and keep killing them while also destroying roadside obstacles to extend your time limit. If it wasn't for the ridiculous rubber-banding by the AI in the races (they literally have super tire grip and do not have to slow down in corners at all, and then they slow down to a snail's pace when they pass you) this mode would have been perfect but as is, it's just very solid. 4/5 stars easy.Slaughter ModeEasily the best part of Zombie Driver HD, the Slaughter Mode is an endless horde mode where you drive a car around a moderately sized arena of your choice (there's quite a few to pick from) and try to stay alive as long as possible. After a set amount of kills, an upgrade drops which may give you access to sporadic weapon drops or turbo, and there are health pickups to help make the surviving a little easier. There isn't much else to say here because not much else needs to be said; Great stress relief and highly replayable for score seekers, 5 stars.Recommendation:(3 + 4 + 5) / 3 = ...ah, forget it, no need for math here. Weak story and absurd race rubber-banding aside, Zombie Driver HD is a fantastic top-down action racing game. If I had to score it: ★★★★½ (the extra half star because of how much fun the whole thing is. No, really.)"

Pick your vehicle3. kill zombies ans fulfill you objectiveIn very, very, short that is the game. You have about 8 different vehicles and all thier strengts, and of course some are just better. But with passengers you sometimes take another vehicle.The story is not that bad, not a huge story line or so but you get before every mission to know a little bit and after, you can skip that if not interested. There are upgrades wich I like. Rockets are awesome, I love to use those, machine gun is fun to. BTW you get 2 objectives, 1 primaire and 1 secundaire. Doing the secundaire give you most of the time some more money but you can get really good upgrades bij also doing the secundaire objective. Also, for those who don't like time presure, there are time levels, but not with a clock (except voor secundaire objective but those are so far always for some extra cash). But, you have to save people, somtimes all somtimes a number out of the total, and the circle goes slowly down and  gets more and more red, don't know what happens when reached bottom, didn't happen yet. Isn't difficult to get in time mostlyThe game is open world, kind of. You can drive around wherever you want, you don't need to do this and that and then get back, you can just go and kill some zombies if you feel like it. Try not to die though, you would have to do what you did in that mission againIf you dont want to do the story you can do slaughter. You can a little area to drive around in and you must try to survive as long as possible, also fun. There are also tournament, i didn't do those so can't tell anything about it.What I dislike are some of the levels where you get like bulldozer, all you do is drive in those levels (only 1 out of the 25 I did so far), the tank is fun in the start because it is so strong, but it loses its challenge in those levels, only had 2 of them yet. They are fun but not as much as most other levelsI really enjoy the game, I get to kill as much zombies as I want, wich also earns more cash. KILL THEM ALLHave to metion, i bought this on sale and I only paid 1,49€ for this, 90% sale. It is it more than worth. I would pay the full 15€ if I knew before this would be so much funEDIT: When story ends you can play it again for funn and try to get the achievements like kill 10000 zombies wth rockets.I now tried some of the tournament. The 1 tournament I played was 4 rounds in total, 2 races 1 where you have to kill the others and i forget what the last one was but they where all fun, that was only the beginner tournament, could get difficult later on."

,Recommended,220820,35211696,Posted: 25 September,all,JohnBart,"Years ago, I used to play the original Zombie Driver, a funny if somewhat lackluster action-driving game. The HD ""remaster"" is a huge improvement in every aspect compared to the original.New missions and mission types, special assignments with mission-specific vehicles (such as tanks, bulldozers or military trucks), revamped graphics and destruction physics, and a much-needed gameplay rebalance (e.g. a better flow of cash after gore-mayhem-and-destruction, and more frequent powerup placement on the game map) make the HD version the definite experience of the game. The besieged city is more atmospheric and alive (?) thanks to the extra cutscenes and the zombie-killing military allies, the new spawnnests and minibosses spice up the enemy variety well enough, while the new weather conditions (fog, bloom, rain, and night missions) also spice up the flow of simple, yet fun missions.Besides the main story mode, there is also a Carmageddon-esque Blood Race mode and the obligatory Survival gameplay as well - none of which were present in the original game, and which also add some longevity to the overall experience.In short, the game is a perfect no-brainer (pun intended) destruction-based top-down shooter, as simple as you might expect by its title. Missions may be repetitive in the long run, voice acting is a bit annoying, and the unskippable cutscenes do more harm than good for the gameplay, but these do not really detract from the overall experience. I really recommend it if you are looking for a simple, yet fun destruction-based vehicle shooter."
