A parody of MacGyver and other unrealistic action heroes, the game has you defuse the danger in various scenarios by, well, clicking on everything on screen in hopes to find the order that works. And that's where McPixel falls short, there is no gameplay, per se. There is no internal logic to decipher, nothing to understand. Click a character or set piece. If nothing happens (that's good), click another one. If♥♥♥♥♥♥blows up, start over with a new order of clicking-on-things. It's basically a time consuming way to play out a bunch of jokes."

Everything seems like a good idea.The wild gameplay, that awards not only the correct solutions but also failed attempts, requires a great deal of creativity. Creativity - not just random clicking on every single pixel on your screeen, as many have pointed out in their reviews. After a time, the game begins to draw you towards its twisted logic. The bumpy run you had the first time playing McPixel, turns out to be very addictive, definately re-playable and captivating long ride.The humour used by the creators is a little bit foul, sure. You will feel it pays tribute to your inner 14-year-old. It fits, however, the randomness and roughness of the game, making you smirk at the most obscure gags. (And is still better than American Pie.) What is even more exciting, the game has been provided with themed levels, for example paying tribute to other famous video games.Also, lots of explosions."

The other quarter of the time, okay, I got myself a cheap chuckle - my personal favourite was trying to work out who the virgin was to throw in the volcano, and ultimately (and successfully) deciding on MYSELF - but the laughs really are too few and far between to put up with the eye-bleedingly awful graphics and incredibly limited gameplay.

It's basically pure trial and error. I guess there's something to be said for seeing all the animations, and you could say this is a game where the journey is more important than winning, but I just didn't think the animations were reallythatfunny, and it doesn't really excuse the poor design.

The graphics are intentionally (I think?) super crude, and the interactions between you (McPixel) and world objects are surreal and unpredictable, which gives the game its charm and character.  The game wisely advises you to play it in short sittings and take breaks.  Indeed, I found if I played more than one set of levels at a time the humor would kind of wear off, and since this game relies entirely on its humor, it stopped being fun very quickly.  But then when I played it the next day it'd be fresh again.  Some drawbacks: The music is repetitive; the graphics are overly crude, so much so that you can't always tell a clickable object exists; there's no achievements (I'm a little OCD so I like achievements).  I think it's a little pricey at $5, but I bought it on sale so I think it was definitely worth whatever it was I paid.

It may not be a new Portal in terms of advancing puzzle games to the next level, but it offers a quick fun, and thanks to the many levels– including the free DLCs and community-created ones– it can last quite long, if you choose to stick with it."

,Recommended,220860,21830774,"Posted: 14 March, 2016",all,viad,"What happens when you combine MacGyver, point and click, and fast paced insane logic? Well, you get McPixel, a game that isn’t afraid to throw logic out the window and give some straightforward jokes.McPixel is a game that can be described as “WarioWare meets point and click adventure”. Each scene has a 20 second timer, with McPixel trying to save the day, often by disarming a bomb. Actions range from moving, picking up objects, and interacting with objects. Given the short time limit to solve the situation, players will tend to combine as many objects as possible. The game’s crazy logic behind the puzzles don’t tend to make sense and often the solutions are found by trial and error, though there are some more sane solutions that can be found. Solving each scene is simple, but the gameplay assists in something bigger, which is the game content itself.In this game, McPixel must save the day. How he does so depends on the scene and the criteria for doing so is often stretched. Throughout the game, various gags are presented, often with random and crazy ideas. Often some gross out humor is applied, so be aware of the random jokes and occasional bodily functions. Along with these kinds of gags, many pop culture references are in the game, especially with TV and video games. These references I feel tend to work better at giving a good laugh, though the various random occurrences that don’t reference anything also are worth a laugh. Anyway, the bulk of the game is in its humor, and McPixel has no shortage of comedy to toss around and make you laugh.On a short note, the game applies a retro style with its art and music. The game is pixelated like an old game, though McPixel does employ a consistent and certain character style. Scenery tends to be pixel art as well, or in some cases pixelated versions of photographs. Animations are crucial to delivering the game’s gags, and the crazy qualities of them work fine with the retro style. Music is the same way as well, using some chiptunes for some nice fat beats. There are not many songs and the tracks are quite short, but it does achieve the retro style with some neat chiptunes.McPixel is a game for those looking to laugh at the absurd and crazy situations and interactions. Gameplay is kept simple to focus on delivering comedy, though the game’s crazy logic can make some puzzles confusing and require trial and error. Still, with some retro styling with the art and music mimicking old video games, McPixel makes for a game to laugh at some silly things."

Although McPixel isn't for everyone, give it a go if you still have the mindset to enjoy immature humor."
,Not Recommended,220860,9344525,"Posted: 4 March, 2014",all,Spootaloo,"McPixel is the epitomy of ""lol so randumb XD"" type humor. While each stage is short and simple enough to figure out fairly quickly, each situation makes pretty much no sense, and the solution even less so; old Sierra point-and-click adventure games were more coherent. I would say it's usable as a quick laugh, but even the gags and jokes throughout are generally juvenile and unfunny (""haha the L on the sign for Pool fell off so it says poo hahahaha""). While ""random"" humor has its place and can provide a good chuckle, it rapidly loses its potency when it's mercilessly pounded into your skull every 5 seconds.Pass."

You are McPixel, a guy who finds himself in the strangest scenarios (a train about to explode, a pyramid about to explode, an iceberg about to explode, a tower about to explode... you get the idea) and needs to save the day with the few objects he can use. Initially you may think that you can use logic for that, but... nope! Everything is absurd. First, the fun lies in trying to save the day, then you replay trying to see all the possible endings (mostly: explosions), or, as the game says, ""find all the gags"".I played the four chapter of the basic game and had enough fun, then got bored and didn't even try the numerous DLCs freely available.

The situations and their solutions are rather obtuse, so working through them is often trial-and-error. This would be fine if the game held up in other ways, but quite frankly the game's attempts at humor -- usually very crude violence or excrement jokes -- fall flat for me and the aesthetics are equally bland unless you're into the occasional pixelated parody.

Not a real game just a good joke.Edit (to make it more helpful :)It is something like point and click adventure, where you solve one screen puzzles. illogical puzzles. so You will click on everything interactive to see what will happen. Usually it will finish with huge explosion.To make a progress (and see some new puzzles) you have to finish successfully some previous puzzles (well, I know its not a big surprise). So you will have to repeat puzzles and hunting for all interactive spots, what i found boring after few screens.I wanted to run through it like running though comic book at least, but it was not possible. i gave up.Some jokes are better some of them are worse. If you like jokes involving urinating or kicking someone's balls maybe you can find it funny.If you are considering buying it you might rather watch some gameplay on internet,or try demo, you will see everything.

,Recommended,220860,9020220,"Posted: 8 February, 2014",all,Animante,"McPixel may seem stupid and pointless from a distance, but the game game is a BLAST to play (get it? hah!). With plenty of in-game levels and tons of free extra ""DLC"" to play, you can spend hours with this game. Many of the levels contain a lot of jokes and references to other games or movies, and most of the bonus levels (which you unlock by not only saving the day by defusing the bombs in every level of that chapter, but also going through and discovering all the gags that involve not saving the day) are straight up homages to those things. The video game one was my personal favorite, where you have to save Cloud and Sephiroth by becoming Jenova, and saving Chell from Portal by opening a portal into her body and tossing the bomb in it, etc. I found myself laughing audibly with some of the ridiculous scenes, such as McPixel choosing to dry hump various objects instead of defusing the bomb.The game menu itself was a delight, each option you pick containing a humorous outcome. The music, though simple was actually quite addicting, and can easily get stuck in your head as it plays in the background of every level that you're trying desperately to defuse a random bomb in less than 20 seconds. Some of the levels were pretty easy, but I don't think the game itself was actually going for a difficulty factor as much as it was a gag factor, and sometimes when the outcome was easy, I actually found myself looking for the funny alternatives instead of defusing the bomb right away. The 8-bit artstylem though simple, actually was very good at depicting the various emotions of the characters, such as McPixel screaming at a soldier to remove the bomb after putting said soldier's own hat on.I'd definitely recommend this game if you could find it on a sale. As great and amusing as it was, it still only contains about 2 hours of actual gameplay, the rest stemming from DLC both made by the actual developers, and by the community itself via the in-game World Creator. Though than again the game only markets itself as $5, so if you've got a fiver to spend, and have a twisted sense of humor, I think you'd enjoy this game."

If you fail, the next mini-level is loaded and you'll be given the chance to try again once the mini-levels cycle back around.There are four ""Acts"" in the game with each Act containing four levels (3 open/1 locked) which are then broken down into five mini-levels.  With some basic arithmetic you can deduce how much playtime that'll get you.  There's also some free, downloadable content which is so-so, and they threw in a one-level rhythm game and some half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥multiplayer chat room (it might be terrible on purpose...)Solutions in the game aren't as straight-forward as you'd expect and that's where most the fun derives.

But in reality it plays more like a ""Hope I can glean a bit of the logic the developers used to figure out what the heck will happen when I click here!"" After awhile you do pick up on what is more likely to happen but no real brain power is involved. I dislike strongly that there is either SOUND or NO SOUND option and have only ever opted to play it with no sound because hearing ""MCPIXEL!"" repeated over and over is less than desirable. It is literally a game of trial and error and then repeating to get bonuses. What you 'think' will happen almost never does and that can be entirely frustrating.Will you feel the same way? No idea but it wasn't my cup of tea. For under 2 bucks though, there are worse ways to spend your money I suppose."

Logically there might be a dozen ways to make a guard leave his post or to interact with a pump, but only one will be correct because of the artificial nature of the game.  A good point and click will keep this under control with reasonable puzzle solutions, while rewarding the player for their time and effort with humor, good music, an interesting story or other unique charm.  McPixel does none of this.  The music is short, repetitive, and not at all pleasing to listen to.  The puzzle solutions are arbitrary enough that all you can really do is click whatever is in the level until you manage to click the correct objects in the correct order.  It lacks a cohesive narrative.  There is humor, but it is crass and juvenile; even compared to other crass, juvenile humor, McPixel is in the back of the pack.There is no reason to buy this game at any price.

Its main problem is also its core mechanic : the solution to its puzzle makes no sense. This is what makes the game funny from time to time thanks to some absurd cutscenes, but this also means there is absolutely no reflexion required.In each of the 100 levels of the story mode (which doesn't have any scenario of course), you are asked to interact with all the items you can and combine them in all possible ways, until you find the ""right"" one (the one that doesn't make the stage explode). Discovering the intended combination doesn't feel particularly rewarding, because unlocking the ""gold medal"" in a stage (which unlocks bonus stages) requires to find ALL possible combinations. In the end, you will just find yourself clicking everywhere until the game congratulates you for completing the stage, and repeat the process until you reach the final cutscene.The only way I think this could be interesting is racing against a friend trying to get all levels done before the other. But in solo, McPixel is terribly empty.The game apparently comes with an editor to create your own stages and share them with the community. I must admit I didn't take the time to explore this mode, nor to test community-made stages, the game itself being so boring I doubt these stages can save it.To sum up, McPixel is a joke, as it was meant to be. But this jokes repeats itself a lot, making it feel terribly long (although the story mode takes two hours to complete), and five dollars seems to be too much for a spoof like this. This is typically the game you would expect to play for free in your browser to kill some time, this doesn't deserve a spot in your Steam library."

It's a game that makes you feel smart for making decisions you would only think are logical if your having a bad trip.  but anyway gameplay.This game is a fast pased point and click puzzle/problem solving game.  you have 20 seconds to figure solve the puzzle and/or (and I hope your not reading this in an airport) find the bomb.  The crazy and over the top solutions are fun to discover, but get old quick, and can feel like punishment for thinking logically.  Each episode like thing, has 6 stages that you must complete, and if you do fail one, you still get to try again once you've played every other stage in the cycle so it is at least easy for how ubsurd and difficult it is to beat each stage.This game has a few good features to keep you entertained for a while.  The story mode is split into 4 chapters, each with 3 episodes, with 6 stages inside, which equals to 60 stages, nothing special, but with the amount of content inside some of those stages, there has been some hard work and thinking done.  You also unlock little mini-games as you beat each chapter.  They aren't anything note worthy, but that is a problem with this game.  It's to chaotic and crazy to remember any given part.  Finally there is endless mode, where you can play through each stage from the game, in one giant episode (not a great completion bonus but it's the best it's got).WARNING: Spoilers(?) ahead?The only real thing that comes close to a story, is a cutscene that is unlocked once you beat the last chapter.  It has McPixel... I don't even really know what happens.For how odd this game is, I enjoyed myself when playing it, but that doesn't excuse the parts of it that are bad (which is sadly a lot).  But seeing as this game did show some good at points, I think that I can safely call it the BEST WORST game ever.So my rating for this game, is a VERY generis 4/10"

My advice would be to spend less than that on it though.Each level is a different scenario that puts the responsibility of preventing an explosive from detonating (or equivalent disaster). A mouse only game, you click on one of the various items in the scenario, McPixel interacts with it, and you hope for the best. The humour usually lies in what happens if McPixel DOESN'T prevent the disaster.There are several levels to play through and in each one two endings to aim for, either a win or specifically funny outcome. The whole game can be completed in a relatively short sitting, maybe 3 hours of straight play. I wouldn't recommend this though since the quickly moving and sometimes flashing backgrounds can be hard on the eyes. The music can also become grating since it repeats mostly the same one track. A saving grace may be that the first time you hear that track you will probably like it.In summation it is a fun experience and I would recommend this to a friend who isn't offended by the idea of a man pleasuring a giraffe to completion. Still, the $5 price tag may cause buyers remorse especially if you don't smile at the idea of manual giraffe gratification. Buy it for less."

,Not Recommended,220860,9356030,"Posted: 5 March, 2014",all,NukeMaus,"McPixel is a point-and-click adventure game. Sort of. The basic premise is that you have 20 seconds to defuse a bomb in each scenario, with various things you can click on to get various outcomes. However, there are some real problems with it:1) There is no logic to the solution. It's really annoying as it's just trial and error until you get the right solution, which gets really dull really fast.2) One of points of the game is it's humour. Except it's really not very funny. It's just ""gags"" most of which involve McPixel hitting or grabbing something and then dying 'comically'. It's just stupid, and not even in a ridiculous cartoon humour way. I played most of the 1st chapter and in that whole time there was one joke that I found remotely amusing.Admittedly, I gave up on the game relatively early on, so it may get better later on, but I really don't think that's much of a selling point. I guess the best thing I can say about it is that it's really cheap, but there are far better free games out there, so again, that hardly works in the game's favour. Even at the low price, it's hard to recommend it. I paid about 50p for it in a sale, and even at that price, I feel like it's only just worth it. Overall, give this a miss, and spend your money on something better."

The humor isn't very sophisticated and centers mostly around kicking, humping and blowing things up. It's just the right thing to air out the brain for 5 minutes and enter a state of braindeadedded bliss. There isn't much else to say, the story mode doesn't really feature a story, you go around clicking through screens till you've found all possible endings - that's it. As a bonus there are some ""free DLCs"" which are hit-or-miss, a endless mode, which basically repeates the screens of the story mode and a ""fart along"" feature, which is amusing for a minute, but not particularly noteworth. It is amusing if you can enjoy crude, simple humor. It only costs 4€ and at that price I'd would buy it again. I loved it."

It's wacky, zany nonsense-filled comedy gameplay, which means it's best not to play too much at one time. High-octane comedy has a habit of getting old if you don't take breaks.Two big issues I have with it: first, there's a handful of rules that aren't really explained. Once you pick up an item, there's no way to put it down, and you can't hold more then one item. If you click on something that causes you to do something - ANYTHING other than pick an item up - the stage ends, whether or not the effect did anything about the bomb of the level.The other issue: your reward for 100% completion is a really crappy final bonus level. Everything else was really fun, but this one level left a very bad taste in my mouth afterwards.I'd recommend picking up this game, but as you can see, I beat everything in 9 hours, and I think 2 of those hours were just me loitering in the ""chatroom"" waiting for someone else to show up.

Additionally, if you feel at any point that this game is too easy to 100% go play Nerdpack in the dlc and try to 100% it :P.The game doesn't have much replay value after the initial play through, but between endless mode and new dlc there is still the potential.

I've tried playing this game a few times but I just can't take more than 5 minutes of it before getting frustrated and closing it. I want to like this game, I really do, It genuinely made me laugh once or twice and the humor is definitely something that I'm into. The only problem is the gameplay, of which there more or less isn't any. It consists of playing through different scenes, each which have a few different things you can click on. Most of the time some of those things will be impossible to differentiate from the background and you end up clicking on the same exact things over and over again as you look for other objects or try to click on objects that seem logical but just so happen to be incorrect because they are too close to something else.As everyone else says, there is no logic. I thought they were joking around and that the solutions would make sense after you finish and I would be able to figure them out, but that's not how it works. Everything in this game is completely random with no logic whatsoever. You could click on any object and any concieveable thing could happen. There is no thinking in this game, there is no way to win other than through sheer blind luck and patience by clicking any object you can.Again, I really wanted to like this game, but it just was too obnoxious for me to actually try to dedicate time to.

This game is pure nonsense and made for humor purposes. You will play in 4 chapters and every chapter has 3 rounds. Each round has 6 different levels. Each level could get a gold rank (which you will eventually get automatically). If you are playing a round for a first time, the rank that you will get most likely will be silver. If you have completed all levels, you are able to re-do the round and able to get the gold ranks. Each level has the same purpose, You will have to find a way to stop the bomb from exploding which will happen within 20 seconds. Even if you win or fail you will move onto the next level. The game is easy to understand.Retro graphics and music.Game is repetitive but simple.Decent music.Able to skip cutscenes with spacebar.Pretty funny.Game is having mind tricks on you.Other things.None.-------------------I Give this game a 7/10"

The art is pretty great as far as pixely things go, and the music is amazing (and so are the menus!)."
