,Not Recommended,220980,10289921,"Posted: 30 May, 2014",all,Javert,"CRYENGINE has been a strong platform in impressive titles for years.  It contains some amazing visual technologies, and the post-processing effect defaults out of the box are great.  It comes with things like the incredibly powerful RENDERDOC utility for profiling your draw calls and timings, which is always useful in game development.  In general it is good engine for major projects and for workflows that involve multiple people/teams.  Unfortunately that's not what their new Engine-as-a-Service paradigm is targeting with a Steam release and $10 single-seat subscription licensing.I'm going to have to rate this down on Steam, due to a serious disconnect between what they're marketing and the experience you are likely to have with it.  It is on Steam specifically to appeal to independent developers with its new subscription based structure that costs less than many MMOs.  The editing tool (which is what you're exposed to right at the start) has a lot of presets, behaviors, and objects for first-person shooters, but not for much of anything else.  Furthermore, CRYENGINE (without serious tweaks) makes some problematic assumptions about the games you'll want to make with it; the concept of health, gravity, characters, the way it handles player controls, etc.  From a quick look around the features in the tools and the demos, you will quickly realize that the package is targeted for gamers who what to try making their own shooter.  Again, there are tons of GREAT features in CRYENGINE and it is, at its core, a pretty good engine for the cost.In closing, CRYENGINE is great for those who are steeped in the workflow and methodologies involved with developing in it.  But those people will already know this and won't need to read these reviews.  To those interested in just trying out a ""triple-A"" engine: be warned.  There is a significant learning curve (like all engines), but the package you are given with CRYENGINE is prohibitively unintuitive, especially to the uninitiated.  I have to vote this down for the simple fact that those reading this review would be better served with any of the other popular engines.  The community and resources you have available to you for learning CRYENGINE as a newbie simply pale in comparison to some of the direct competitors, and I'm afraid that's a vitally important aspect when you're targeting this kind of audience."

(And specify the capsule anyway?)Workaround: Load the default Player Model with all its Meshes and Textures and make it invisible, so you can use the Actor Physics Entity.The feet alignment system always expects the gravity on -z, when walking on a wall or on the ceiling the feet gets flipped 90 or 180 degrees...We've used the CRYENGINE to create a first person puzzle game at our University, a quick impression can be found here:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omAnp2eHSwEThere are of course some great features in this engine (the renderer of course), but the engine was built from ground up with the intention to create first or third person shooters (on an open island) and without the ability to change this intention this is hardly any good general engine.The other side is the absolutely amazing WYSIWYG Sandbox Editor.If you just want to create levels for the integrated shooter, or get a grip on Level Design this might be just the tool for you.I personally do not want to work with this engine again as long as its so focused on one genre without the ability to change that."

I have around 300+ hours in the editor.The engine is really REALLY powerful, that being said its not for the faint of heart to develop on. If you have a solid programmer or two though you can make the most AMAZING looking game, and the animation system allows for extremely powerful and smooth gameplay animations.Honestly, after using Cryengine for a while I would never be able to go back to Unreal 4, Cryengine is just so supperior to build things quickly, and make it look amazing with very little extra work. The gameplay building aspect of it could be easier, but thankfully they are working hard on the documentation and have make big strides recently. When 3.7 comes out there will be almost no reason at all to use UE4 or Unity anymore. This engine performs amazing as well, I have a full very filled scene at 3 million to 4 million polygons with 3500 drawcalls, and I am getting 89-110 FPS solid on a single 980. I have had upwards of 9 Million running smooth before.There is just no comparison for power. Usability? Thats another story."

The lager, the better; but a 10,000M*10,000M map size option should suffice for the projects of most independent developers, without compromising the accuracy of floating-point refereneces.In fact, if you remember Cryengine 3.2, Cryengine did at one point support larger map sizes; but it was removed because it was thought to cause issues with floating-point references; although, I myself, along with many others never experienced this problem, so I am confident that larger map size IS possible, it will just require the developers to push for it; users of CryEngine have been asking for it for a long time, but we still do not have it with CryEngine.And it is also important to consider, that map size (or lack of it, in this case) is one of the most reoccuring reasons why developers choose not to go with CryEngine; if the developers of CryEngine can get this problem fixed; it will eliminate one of the biggest drawbacks of CryEngine, and motivate users of other graphics engines to make the switch to CryEngine.  Also, the Voxel editor has been broken ever since 3.5.x. Please try to fix these problems as soon as possible!"

If you can get past the learnng curve, and agree to some of the engines more finicky demands and requirments, it's a massively rewardng piece of software.A word to the wise to those thining of dabbling in the engine though. Be prepared to learn and think for yourself as the engine doesn't have the same kind of community and support network that Unreal/Unity provide. Most of the information you will need is contained within the extensive documentation, but it's up to the artist to make of it what they will. I see many people try it out and then publicly denounce the engine, threatening to jump ship to another, as if Crytek cared. The developers of this engine aren't about fostering an indie community around their engine, it's not homegrown. This is a piece of highend software that is only really used for high-end production.Although using the Cryengine is not withouts it's challenges, it can bring the most out of your work it a relatively short space of time when the user grasps the fundamentals."

CRYENGINE is an awesome engine with a learning curve that people will realize how powerful it can be. I highly recommend everyone to subscribe this engine, if you are really determined to create CRYENGINE games, before making any reaction how bad it is. There are plenty of tutorials available atcrydev.netand video lessons like YouTube, etc. I understand the only drawback for using this game engine would be the lack of programming knowledge.CRYENGINE supports C++, Lua, and Python programming languages. However with the improvement of CRYENGINE's flowgraph system, it actually makes gaming development more understandable and fun. I personally like how the documentation explains the new AI flowgraph behavior scripting system that allows AI characters to behave or interact. Because it generally uses the updated Modular Behavior Tree (MBT) system, it is considered a great learning experience to understand how AI behaviors work, along scripting with Lua and flowgraph.The terrain generator tool is also awesome. Developing real-time terrain geometry has never been so much fun, unlike UDK's terrain generating system. The terrain generator is simple to use, painting terrain grounds, flora, and trees without any hesitation . UDK terrain generator system does not have those simple features as CRYENGINE does.I had purchased all CRYENGINE's PacktPub books in eBook format and they are all great reference books for game developers who are interested in knowing more about the CRYENGINE.I personally believe that CRYENGINE is the best engine for creating real-time open environments. UDK, on the other hand, is only good for creating closed-end environments. However, CRYENGINE can also develop closed-end environments, but renders beautifully with high level of detail.Before subscribing to CRYENGINE, you must have a mid-to-high end GPU graphics card, like NVIDIA GeForce GTX or AMD Radeons to experience CRYENGINE'S real-time performance. It should work fine on PCs with intel i5/i7 or AMD FX processors with 8GB ram or above.BIG TIP: SAVE OFTEN!"

From FPS to RPG to RTS.... there is a small jump for skilled programmer.From all engines that are reasonably available for developer teams (or single dev - like me), this one is:- cheapest option by far, for only 10 eur per month you get access to considerable C++ source, and ability to publish any game during that time with 0 royalties or hidden costs!- greatly tuned to be usable with minimal change (out of the box look is matchless)- access to C++ source code (to a level 95% programmers would ever need) (you can get whole source contacting them for a contract)- Extremely powerful Sandbox software, where map and content creating (mannequin, flowgraphs...) is best in its class, all done with 0 need in programming. (People have made RPGs with flowgraphs alone)- Streamlined communication between C++, lua scripting, xml, flash.- Scaleform GUI (basically you can make a GUI -or whatever you want- in flash, and then -extremely easily- import it ingame)- Flowgraphs, intuitive system of rapidly designing game logic (in a few min you can make a regular FPS on a empty map: spawning, enemy spawning, camera, sounds, notifications...etc)- Engine is designed, for small to huge teams, just look at the dev teams that use this engine and are still in development, for instnance games like : Kingdom Come: Deliverance, Star Citizen, Ryse, Evolve and many many more..- Most importantly. engine is regulary updated, its imbued with new technology (recent deal with AMD and MANTLET integration)...etc!"

Terrain editor is great and makes creating a custom topology for your level a breeze.  However... object creation/editing is pretty much non-existent and object editing is cumbersome.  The documentation is borderline useless if you are looking to do anything more advanced than just placing sample assets, running around shooting sample asset weapons at sample asset targets from sample asset vehicles...  Starting to see the theme?  What you get for a ridiculously low monthly subscription fee is the need to buy several thousand dollars worth of Autodesk software to be able to create and export any of your own original asset content - and even then its through a hoaky plugin.  There is no support for any open tools like Blender, MakeHuman, Gimp, or any non-Autodesk commercial tools.  And speaking of no support, the community is still incredibly small.  Search through youtube, you'll find a guy that has some videos...  If you want to write your own plugin to bridge the gap, good luck ... there is no documentation on the seven or so custom crytek file types, and the attempts to create export plugins (i.e. cryblend) are equally poorly documented and implemented.  Don't get me wrong, I really really want to be a fan of this game engine.  With the power and simplicity in so many of the important areas, it just comes up too short in the critical areas to be able to build something you've created.  I even gave it one last shot by searching through the internet to find their development roadmap, thinking now that they are hurting for cash they might be looking at expanding their scope to include the community they are trying to serve...  alas, the asset roadmap has a long romance with Autodesk ahead.  For me, it's back to UDK which has an incredibly strong community, open asset support throughout the industry (open and commercial) and all that for just a little bit more a month with a small royalty fee.

But even Unreal Engine 4 came with huge changes from UDK 3 and nobody complained.  You won't master it in 3 hours, not even 3 months. If you've used Crytek tools in the past you should be used to these upgrades.I recommend this to people who have used the SDK in the past. If you haven't touched it however you might want to wait for better documentation. For this cheap of a cost, I think it's worth the lack of polish. If they follow through with their promises, this will only get better in time. They already promised more access to source code it's only a matter of time.If you take a look at all of the engines, CryEngine has it's place and it's known for having the most robust and expandable feature set. Every engine has its strong points and its weak points.Also let me highlight this, IF you are actually developing a game and want to test out capabilities use the free SDK. If you see a feature missing from the commercial version you want, ask about it. If it's not available move on to another engine unless you want to take the time to code around that issue."

It's method relly very little on offline renders (baking stuff), which is nice to make modifications without having to rebuild/rebake too much stuff like Unreal). But if you are doing semi indoors and want radiosity, CRYENGINE realtime lighting is too optimized and will be apparent without greeblish texturing. The looks it produces can still be appealing for archviz being synthetic (lighting parts GI could make too dark) yet modern (AO and lightprobes over old ambient lighting). It has default settings for beautiful water and windy folliage, as in the others you'll have to do the shaders from 0.CRYENGINE is fast and is not as resources consuming like Unreal (which keeps running even on the background). It's post processing is beautiful but not easily customizable.The FlowGraphs for scripting felt a bit more similar to Kismet (high level) than the new blueprints or Antares Universe for Unity.Documentation is good old fashioned objective and made by the makers. Not the maze of web 2.0 resources Unreal decided to go.It also supports 3dconnexion mouses, which is great.I did not like the limit of only 1 UV set and how high level the Flow Graphs are. Terrain editing brushes are a bit weird being relative to technical bounds instead of world linear scale, but to add and remove parts is very easy in opposition to Unity and Unreal. Terrain also has some procedural tools that make it possible to create a realistic terrain without a third part specialized tool."

I have used Unity & UDK in the past but for a next gen game or Portfolio peice CryEngine produces the best result.Pros- Dynamic Lighting System- PBR Rendering- Easy to use Material Editor- The Import setup from your 3D Application can be hard to begin with but becomes really efficient to update/ change meshes at the click of a button- Cheap, $100 a year is worth it if your a serious game developer, modder or artist- Procedural Vegetation- Voxel-Based Global Illumination (SVOGI)- Loads of control over render visualisation such as checking Polycount, LOD's, Proxies, Anti-Aliasing, Sceenshot Resolution output, Specular Validation and much much more.Cons- Not as flexible as others engines to script in as Crytek is slowly releasing parts of their source code while most is still locked like there network layer- Textures don't update automatically sometimes which can result in making you reload the level, refresh the model in the scene or delete .dds files to force update- The Animation Editor can be hard to use for new users- Documentation for high end users can be a bit sparseNOTE:I would only recommend purchasing CryEngine EAAS long term if you are a developer, modder or artist who plans to frequently use it for your next game, Cinematic or presentation toolI also created a guide on Asset Production | Maya to CryEnginehttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=355129729& Blend Layers | Maya to CryEngine for those interested!http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=526742767"

Cryengine forces you to become more social by asking help from community and forums, it will make you become more patient and obedient ( what the engine ask to you is what you must provide to it '''''no freestyle allowed''''and you must find a way to do that), people use to approach this engine with very naive perceptions ( gonna be easy, the terrain and environment creation system is very cool to create beach and coconuts, etc etc) but Cryengine is like a spacial and planetary conquest, before you can leave the earth and enjoy the travel, you need months and months training in the desert ( sometimes alone,sometimes tired,etc) like astronauts do.The new fbx import feature is a historical step and i wait for the next builds to see the evolution.The Track view video exporter still doesn't work too.I'm proud to grow up with a wonderful piece of software...hey fan boys doesn't mean that i don't use the other game engines...each engine has it's specific field of work ,only the nature of the project defines the tool to use..."

Even the tool is not easy to use as Unreal Engine 4, but the function of these tools is absolutely powerful.Such as the Designer tools, it can let you smooth you model in engine, and you can see the difference immediately, and also it can let some developers don't need to use 3Ds Max, because it also have UV unwrap function. It's one of the most powerful widget of CryENGINE.Also the Physically-based rendering is absolutely awesome. It don't need us to add some light in the diffuse map, we can use tons of different maps to create a material, and it can perform very well. Also the Voxel-based Global Illumination is very nice, it don't need us to bake the environment probe anymore, and also let the graphic look more realistic.But, as an user who used CryENGINE about 3 years, I know CryENGINE still need to improve many things, just like the terrain system of CryENGINE is too old, not support a big terrain and the modify tool is very out dated.And all of the shader is not open-source, and we can't create a custom waster shader.The coding part is very hard to learn, because the implementation of GameDLL is really complex, and without any useful official documentation. ( I almost took a half year to learn about the workflow of GameDLL... )But this engine improved so much after 3.6, it improved the character editor, implemented PBR, also added a Designer Tool.

Thx Cry-Adam and the team for all of the hard work! Official FBX support added and documentation is looking better and better! Proud to use the engine and will keep on supporting you guys!--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I was really looking forward to the ""New CryEngine"" SDK and I'm really disappointed ;( I'm sorry to be the bringer of bad news but this is basically the Free SDK with the PBR system added for the engine. I'm having the same old problems as the Free SDK the material editor will not display the materials and textures in the window correctly or at all only way to see it is in the scene.No official ""new"" FBX import pipeline like Unreal Engine 4 supports... you have to work through the CryEngine plugins which support only Maya and 3ds Max. The biggest problem is there is a huge lack of quality documentation to learn the engine. They have upgraded their documentation a lot but it is still far from really getting down to learn how the engine works. There are no officially ""demo"" scenes or marketplace like unreal has to teach you how to makes games. The only two scenes included is an old Forest scene and a new Airport scene, no top down or 3rd person scenes to learn how they created the scenes... its really frustrating I mean just look at UE4 and what they have done! Digital Tutors has some tutorials but no official tutorials from Crytek or demo scene to learn how to use and create amazing games with the engine!Its really sad there is so much potential but its going take a long time before it even comes close to Unreal Engine 4's documentation and support. In my opinion the major engines with the best support and documentation is still Unreal Engine 4 and Unity4 ""Unity5"". If you want to start learning and creating your game asap I would go either UE4 or Unity4 based on learning material/documentation as making game is already hard and time consuming."

Per the EaaS EULA you're basically on your own when it comes to official support from Crytek. Sure, you can use the CryDev forums, but they have long been lackluster in terms of fixing larger, engine-based problems as well as answering those questions that you can't find in a community-based setting.2) CryTek boasts that the engine is ready to use out of the box! However, that's not entirely true. We've encountered so many show-stopping errors/issues with CryEngine EaaS (animations, physics, networking code, rendering, etc) that it's hard to justify that the engine is in fact capabile of building a full-fledged game free of serious problems. Couple that with the fact that you get no official support from CryTek only adds to the frustrations in game development.3) Lack of Documentation. The CryDocs are great for what they're intended to provide...aka, information/guidance. However, overlapping versionary differences (ie. Version 3.5 and 3.6 exisit in the same area), lack of complete (working) examples, and no clear way of knowing if you're looking at the most up-to-date documentation causes more confusion that it actually helps.4) No clear roadmap from Crytek. Crytek doesn't appear to have any sort of internal game-plan for new features, patching bugs, new content, etc...or at least that's how it seems. The community has screamed about features they want re-implemented/fixed, as well as new features that are critical to game development. However, Crytek rearely evers confirms they're in the process of working on those features. Also, there have been several serious flaws and bugs that have been reported on numerous occasions from the dev community that haven't been addressed or fixed even after several patches/updates. Personally, I'm all for adding ""new"" things...but please, for the love of everything development, release the patches for critical features that are preventing games from being developed.In summary, if you're like me and don't enjoy dishing out money (on a monthly basis) for a product that doesn't come with offical development support, you're better off going with Unreal Engine. You'll find higher quality support, a dedicated and focused company who backs the development community 100%, and plenty of community (and official) resources to aid in your game's development. CryTek was once a great company with a solid, kick♥♥♥♥♥game engine. However, those days appear to be long gone. Don't waste your money on this."

No experience with game making, level editing, game scripting, or anything gaming other than playing them since I was in the womb... I'm not recommending this because most of the people on steam like to play games, not make them. The Idea of creating one is even cooler because all the ideas you've had your whole life could come to light if you just had a game engine at your disposal... This is not something you can simply pick up and go with... it requires loads of time learning the software... then loads of other time learning other software so that you can import the stuff that you can't make on this software... which is another learning curve in itself, high priced software most of which start and average about 200 dollars (on sale)....The only real teacher here in this software is the premade levels from which you can go in and see what they've done to construct them... it's not enough... It would be better for anyone considering this software to get the free version to practice with before purchasing the sub, as the sub only allows you the right to sell the game you make if you happen to make something that you CAN sell...Short version, Don't buy the sub for this if you're a gamer, If you're a game maker by all means go for it but if you can't find your games from your steam library on your local device without googling it... Don't get this software.. For further information and general complaining please continue to read my post...First things first, This is a great level designer, good pre loaded textures and auto generated maps, there are some good features in this to make a regular game dev happy, I would think.I'm well over .5 hrs on using this, I feel like I've been using this for a while. As time goes on it seems they strip more and more features away, Now I'm usually not one to give up on a product so easily given I'm in the IT field, I know the process of trial and error, as well as patience...This program is so lightly touched on in the community (youtube) that you almost have to go to school to know what you're doing with even the tiniest basics of utilizing game engines, Or know Dutch or german cause thats what most of the (outdated) videos are up as. (Which the term Game engine is used very loosly) The support for this application is below none, If you do fine videos on this product it's very... VERY outdated. Goes to show how much they've stripped from it.This is a sandbox editor... if you're like me and you're just starting out with game making and trying to use engines that are out for use with the public, Don't dive head first into something like this and think you're ideas are going to be AAA sellers... The learning curve for this is beyond comprehension, You're better off getting the free version vs paying 10 bucks a month. First off you need to learn how to utilize this system, after a couple of months twiddling with it you'll get familiar enought that you can craft a basic level... But then, ho ho, then you want to add something like a custom sound file... Almost impossible with some sort of background experience... All the vids I've watched were where you could simply click on the sound module and import .mp3 directly from a location on your hard drive... now... now its hell, XML, and Notepad++ editing, and even then you get stuck and frustrated...The Game could get dark, and I've wanted to create some sort of port that would allow night time and a killer after you, but you need light... and that just wasn't happening. I've spent more time trying to work around simple procedures like getting a working flashlight... no weapon or attachment, just a flashlight to work... it doesn't, without knowledge of script editing. Adding custom sound files, say you want to do voiceover for your level... Forget it, not going to happen. Even the files on crytech website are out of date, Supporting modules on the documents that are no longer available in the actual program.When you search for this software on tutorials or any kind of documentation, you don't know if you're watching tutorials on this sandbox version or the actual game engine, I assume that they differ because of the radical differences within the interfaces, such as missing modules and what not.I could rant for days about this, but I won't keep you from trying a month, I feel that actually becoming a part of this and realizing it for yourself is beyond what anyone could actually tell you.Overall, if you're like me and have never even set foot in the shoes of a game dev, Don't buy this with hopes of learning it quickly or at all. Without proper documentation, video support on basic setups, and lack of dev support, This is just not going to do anything but leave a void in your soul that you couldn't even bargain with the hades to fill... My best advise if you're still ademant on getting this software is to wait...

,Recommended,220980,15208213,"Posted: 4 April, 2015",all,TheGamerNick,Cryengine is the best 3d Rendering Software for creating full-realstic games
,Recommended,220980,15031810,"Posted: 24 March, 2015",all,Snip(e)Rusher,"Great Engine, Great Price but where is an option for the sourcecode? :(OK, two years ago, I never thought that there are AAA Engine out which provide a source code access for Indies and absolutely newcomers and may also Crytek needs time to analyse the new market situation.I made few little steps with the CryEngine SDK, later with the Unreal SDK and now with the Unreal Engine 4. But also I had tested the CryEngine offered here on Steam (ok, only a really short time - But it was so powerful as I thought) and the Unity 4 Pro (ok, now there is a Version 5 with PBR, better lightning and so on). So lets`s compare these Engine.From all the big 3 Major Game Engine which can be accessed by every one, the CryEngine have the best graphic and physic rendering inside (so long you don't use frameworks/middlewares like the nVidia Framework, which give you the nearly same results in all engines). And off course, with the CryEngine you have also access to the best available AI.Ok there is something more but it's not objective, the CryEngine Level- and Terrain-Editor is my prefered editor. Yes you can get the same results and options for automatic generated terrains and foliage in aspect of the heights and angles - But with the CryEngine Level/Terrain editor this is out of the box more intuitive andfaster.Inside the CryEngine is working a powerful audio/sound middleware, OK this have to paid separately, but it's fully include, it works great and with extra fees lower as 2,500 USD for (for bigger releases) this is not really expensive. And this is the point, where we have to talk about the price and the last big positive point for the CryEngine:With <10 €/$ per month and no royalties, this is a really low priced engine which gives Indie teams the ability to take as much from there project as they can. It technical better then the Unity 5 and does not cost a one time fee of 1,500 USD. Compared with the Unreal Engine, which have no monthly fees, this is also cheaper because you have not to pay the 10% of royalties fees. Please let`s make a small calculation:You have 5 team members and producing a small game in your free time. You spend also 1k-10k USD for assets, plugins, middlewares... So you and your team/friends would release a game with your loved game style and art. So you are working 1-2 years 20h per week (wow, this is unpaid ;) ....) and then you are releasing your game on your own page and/or inside the Steam network:If you sell 10,000 copies for each 10 USD:Unreal Engine: You have to pay 10,000 USD to Epic (this is OK)Unity: You have to pay 5x 1,500 USD = 7,500 USD (hmm, is still less)CryEngine: 5 devs x 18 months x 10 USD = ~810 USD (wow, this is really low ;))Now you had your first discounted sales and you want bring it on a new level with a typical indie price:If you sell 100,000 copies for each 20 USD:Unreal Engine: 200,000 USDUnity: 7,500 USDCryEngine: ~810 USD +2,500 USD (sound)And of course there are additional fees for Steam and the App-Stores, mostly 30% of every sale plus the local taxes with a average of 20% - Only these two fees will cut your benefits to 50% of you market-prices. So it's important to talk about the fees!If you sell 100,000 copies for each 20 USD you will get 1 million for your team of five people. But from this 1 million you have to pay the 10k for assets, 2k for sounds, ... let's say 20k (and this is really low calculated). For the two years of work with powerful PC, you have also pay for additional hardware (new/bigger screens, new graphic cards from AMD and Nvidia to test the different settings, ...) lets say, you need additional 30k... And the power which you need, lets say 20k... and and and...OK, from your two million of revenue, you got one million to pay your bills and your invest: After this you have 900,000 USD minus the fees for your Engine (200,000 USD for Unreal, 7,500 USD for Unity and 810 USD for CryEngine). This 896,690 USD you have now to split in a part for your next game and live and for a small revenue... It's not much and really not enough to hire additional experts... especially if have to pay 200,000 USD to epic and you only get 700,000 for your team and next project. And this after 1-2 years of hard developing parallel to your work.So this small math session was for all the negative Voters which used the engine for less than 0,x hours... And off course if you only the a part of this, may the 10,000 copies for each 10 USD: you will only get 40,000 USD (Unreal), 42,500 USD (Unity) or the 49,190 (CryEngine)...So yes, the CryEngine is the cheapest engine of all the three available Engines and this is also cheaper as Steams upcomming Source Engine 2 - If you don't want to publish your game primary to steam, because you also think that the 30% royalities are too high.---------------Summary---------------+ Best AI+ Best out of the box graphics (including lightning, parallex, composing for vegetations, ...)+ Best out of the box physics (not only nVidia PhysX)+ Best out of the box sound system (for bigger releases, you have to pay small extra fee)+ Best price for all small and big releases (only extra small releases will bring you a lower fee/royalities with the Unreal Engine)+Really goot Terrain/Level editor+ Good Multiplayer Setup+ Best working LOD and DOD (more details and larger maps)+ Together with Unity, really good tools for perfomance monitoring+ Best water volumes, time of day system, shadows, ... OK best graphic/physic/ documentation- No source code access for Indies, also not for a extra fee- Engine and instruments are focused on Shooters, and this you will see every time- Smallest community (and also this is necessary if you are an Indie)- No Asset-Store with out of the box working scripts, propperties, and so on- Only few implemantation of actually external tools and middlewares (this works much better with Unreal and Unity), e.g. Substance Designer and advanced materials, SpeedTree, ... - But if you are working only with Autodesk Maya/3DSM it doesn't matter)- No mobile plattform support (but also the Unreal Engine had a lot of problems with mobile plattforms, so Unity is the only one which is working for you if you want deploy your game cross plattform or primary for mobile devices running on Android or iOS).The Cryengine is the best for everyone who wants the best looking results and who are making Shooter or similar games. Off course, also other teams had made totally other games with the CryEngine, but this needs a lot more time as you are working with Unreal Engine."

CryEngine is someting that I keep coming back to every two or three months, hoping there are substantive changes, but there never really are.  There is a good engine here, but it is hampered by a poor art pipeline and a dubious license.  I say poor art pipeline because unless you use 3DS Max and Photoshop (and marginally Maya) you cannot get assets into the engine.  Blender support is non-existent.  FBX support is only for static geometry.  The sad thing is that there is/was a cadre of developers developing a Blender exporter who needed basic support from CryTek and never received it.  Basically CryTek has a long habit of completely disregarding Indie developers.The license is dubious because the minute your subscription lapses you lose access to your game.  Contrast this to the UE4 license which grants you access to the version of the Engine you downloaded in perpetuity.In short, this version of the CryEngine SDK is a shoddy attempt to compete with UE4, and lacks considerable foresight.  In contrast to CryTek, Epic is a company that values and respects its Indie developers. The choice should be obvious."
