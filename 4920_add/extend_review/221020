,Not Recommended,221020,16306075,"Posted: 11 June, 2015",all,Trilion,"TL;DR: DO NOT PURCHASEThe game is broken and unfinished.The game is abandoned by the developers.They're censoring constructive negative criticism.They essentially took the $2 million dollars and ran.They're not letting new potential buyers know it's abandoned.The GameI played the game for around 300 hours in total. Only around 80 of those were recorded by Steam due to me playing the other hours within Steam Offline mode. In darkness and secrecy, the game was abandoned by the developers during Alpha, the updates stopped rolling out and eventually, many months later a non significant update was released and the game was now considered ""Finished"" according to the their Steam Store page. But in truth, the game was nowhere near being finished, it had and still has a ton of bugs and issues. There's a lot of things missing from the game, and the AI is beyond horrible. The AI is bad enough to give your townsfolk a tendency to end up killing themselves. I wish I could say that events such as that are rare, but they aren't. It's common and in some occasions, it causes your entire village to die.MarketingThere were no/still isn't any announcements or information on the Town's store page letting potential new buyers know that the project has been abandoned.Eventually articles surfaced stating that the game was indeed abandoned, the developers were interviewed and claimed""In fact, the team is currently thinking about instead working on a sequel to Towns through which they want to implement all the features that they could not with the original game.""and within their community forums, one of the developers claim that#Discussions_QuoteBlock_AuthorTowns is very much alive and kicking.#Discussions_QuoteBlock_AuthorSo so far Towns has sold more than 200k units and generated a gross revenue of more than 2M usd. and although we are pretty sure we can and will sell a lot more, we still see it as a huge success.Dictatorship / CensorshipAfter reading some reviews of the game, and reading the original posts people made on the Steam and/ortownsgame.comforum. (Including deleted ones, thanks to caching) It's quite clear that the developers are silencing anyone and everyone who is posting/discussing negative critizism of their game. And they're doing it forcefully, they're also going the extra mile by deleting the post, banning the user and then responding to it publicly, claiming the player posted harassment among other accusations. Due to them removing the post/thread and banning the user, there's no way for a reader to verify what happened unless the reader has cached versions of the forum. Out of the 50 posts I read through, which all had been deleted for ""Boycotting"" ""Harassment"" and other reasons. Only a mere 6 of them had anything that was even borderline harassment or boycotting.ConclusionEssentially, me and many others came to the conclusion that they took the money and ran. They're still trying to get people to buy it by censoring everything they can. And the reason for abandoning the game? Because they were ""burnt out"" yet they claim they will make a sequel. Do not purchase this game, and I highly advice people not to purchase any future releases or new games from this company/developers ever again based solely on what they're doing with this game and the social media involving it.RefundValve added arefund additionto Steam on June 2nd, 2015 that couldpotentiallyallow customers to refund Towns as the development of the game has halted.#Discussions_QuoteBlock_AuthorYou can request a refund for nearly any purchase on Steam—for any reason. Maybe your PC doesn't meet the hardware requirements; maybe you bought a game by mistake; maybe you played the title for an hour and just didn't like it.It doesn't matter. Valve will, upon request viahelp.steampowered.com, issue a refund for any reason, if the request is made within fourteen days of purchase, and the title has been played for less than two hours. There are more details below, buteven if you fall outside of the refund rules we’ve described, you can ask for a refund anyway and we’ll take a look.FeedbackAlso note that posting your own experiences with Towns whether good or bad assists potential newcomers in making their decision in whether to purchase the game or not."

During the most recent sale I pointed users to a great review about the history of the game and what has happened with the devs.. It was removed as ""boycott thread"" I then made a post regarding how it wasn’t and it was a review... I was then banned from the forums.I have never seen such shadyness from developers or steam forum moderators.  Stay FAR AWAY!!!Here is why I was supposedly banned...You have been banned from Towns Discussions by a forum moderator for your post in ""Towns General Discussions"":YetiChow Moderator 3 hours agoDeleted thread ""Don't buy this game"". Reason: spam, calls to boycott, and the fact that the same topic has been done to death already. Also a rather icky necroposting.A reminder, these kind of boycott threads will NOT be tolerated. There's a reviews page for reviews; if people ask for opinions then that's another place to give them; but these unsolicited boycott threads are just unacceptable.I highly disagree with this. My original post was notifying potential buyers of a great review that was written about this game. It told the back story of what happened with the devs for this game and how they abandoned it(surprise? it just happened again). How could that be a ""boycott thread""? If I had somehow managed to find a positive review for towns and asked the user base to read it and get educated of the background of the game it would somehow be tolerated. This just again shows how shady you are YetiCHow for removing threads entirely and labelling them as something they are not.Update:  YetiChow has now updated his original post to again try to make me look bad.  If you are going to police the forums in a dictatorship manner and not allow users to share reviews or their opinions unless it is in a positive way atleast own up to it.YetiChow ModeratorI was going to avoid naming names in the hope this was an isolated incident; but apparently that's not the case. Also deleted another topic by the same user bizkit_109, written in response to my deleting the original thread. This user has now been warned, and further behaviour in the same manner will not be tolerated.Apparently they like to silence any honest negativety towards the game and if you display any of that you get the big ban hammer.  What a joke this develpoer is and the staff it lets moderate its steam forums.UPDATE!!! MAY 28 2015 !!!!!After a user made a post asking YetiChow to comment about my review he again went after me and spread more lies saying the following:YetiChow ModeratorFor the record, I'm the one who issued that ban, not Supermalparit, not Burningpet, nor Moebius (the ""second dev"" who seems to be the person this post is addressed to?). The reason I issued that ban was because the poster was spamming (and worse, abusing other posters as well as the developers; the spam offence happened to be the straw which finally broke the camel's back).I didn't want him again to be able to lie to the community and spread more misinformation so I confronted him on this as I never attacked the devs nor another forum poster.  He then banned me permanently from the forums.  Here is the screen shot of his post, my reply, and my new ban.  What a joke this guy is.http://i.imgur.com/Auuyizz.jpgSTAY FAR AWAY FROM THIS GAME AND ANYTHING ELSE SMP DEVELOPS!!

Enough said.http://steamcommunity.com/app/221020/discussions/0/35220315866244607/Now for the review:The game is time consuming which is why you may see players with a fair amount of hours, the bugs become more apparent the longer you play. Horrible AI, AI starving itself with plenty of food. Slow productivity of the AI. You have to micromanage every aspect of the game which to me and everyone else in the forums, is horrible AI construction and pathing that they will not fix. If you attempt to build a house all at once in the game, the builders constructing it will not stop working on it until it is finished, that includes dieing in the process from starvation (with plenty of food next to them).... feel free to drop me a comment on here with anything else you would like to know. *I do not respond to Lvl 0 Steam accounts with blocked profiles, your comment will get deleted.Dungeons get even more involved and getting to them is a pain... to say the least. Construction is not polished at all.To sum it up, the game runs, if you work around the poor mechanics of the game, it is playable. Its extremely time consuming which looking at this game, it should be a faster payout of fun since its a bit behind its time.There is no Dev support in the forums, just moderators pushing the game every now and then. Development is next to nothing, look at the update history."

Let me clarify .. some other reviewers mention Early Access but the fact of the matter is that this game was not released as Early Access, it was being offered as a finished product when I bought it back in 2012.. well no way was it finished then and still isn't now 2 years later! It could be said that Early Access hadn't started back then so we might forgive that transgression - but then this game should either be categorized as Early Access right now or removed from Steam because it isn't the complete product it is being marketed as.*if you want a charming game where little computer people wander round and build a home, eat, sleep, dig up treasure, fight monsters, etc.. then go check out 'Craft the World', this is an Early Access title that already feels like it's polished and finished(except for missing later campaign levels); it certainly feels like a AAA title compared to Towns.."

If you're looking at reviews to decide whether it's worth your money you can get a lot more enjoyment out of other games at any price point and a lot less frustration.  You can mod the heck out of the game manually to make it somewhat passible to get past some of the more glaring development omissions but it only gets you so far.

,Not Recommended,221020,12262353,"Posted: 27 September, 2014",all,Good Ol' Bender,"The first and most infamous game to come out of Steam's ""Greenlight"" program, Towns is an incomplete and buggy mess, released in a beta state (yet conusmers such as myself were not initially informed of the fact it was still in beta) that never was completed, but rather ABANDONED by its programmer in a miserable state.  That's right, the sole developer/programmer took the money and ran.  The game is as complete as it will ever be, and that's very depressing.Towns was billed as a ""Dwarf Fortress""-type game, wherein you build a town atop a ""dungeon"" filled with various baddies.  Your goal is to build a nice enough town to support guards to protect your citizens, and adventurers who will come to your city (given your city has the necessary buildings) and venture into the depths to assault the creatures therein.  The problem is the programming is dreadfully incompetent.  The AI is beyond dumb.  People will stand around and starve to death rather than harvest and eat food.  Citizens will wander off alone and get themselves killed by groups of enemies.  The ""tutorial,"" if you can call it that, teaches you next to nothing about the game.  The still images of the towns initially shown on the game's Steam page were actually impossible to create in the game.  Building (especially roofs) is an exercise in frustration as pieces don't seem to want to fit together like they should.  The programmer's ambitions far exceeded his capabilities and after as few beta updates (which didn't really fix anything), he simply bailed.  What a great guy.Don't buy Towns.  Get something better.  And practically ANYTHING is better than this pile of excrement."

A few very minor bugs are present, the AI is a bit dopey, the enemy scaling is absurd (due to the market system, you can get Gold, a top tier material early on and proceed to completely stomp the first 5 or 6 floors of the dungeon, then suddenly it all comes to a halt on the next floor as enemies can one or two shot your heroes regardless of armor because armor only increases evasion, it doesn't make people more capable of taking damage) the game can have massive lag at times when doing mass item hauling (most common when you want to sell several buckets of iron) and the punishment for doing something wrong can be horrible especially when you don't know why said thing is bad (ie you have to make graves for corpses or they spawn strong ghosts, but now there's an event lategame that can rarely spawn even stronger Zombies for your village to fight off if you didn't build your graveyard a mile away, even high level zombies can spawn potentially adding to the death toll unless your village is well equipped O_OHowever, despite all the bad things, I feel like they're more nitpicks that could be ironed out later (if they ever do) the game is strangely satisfying when you do the smallest of things. I felt glad when I got my first town up and running with a constant food supply and with enough production to allow the town to build walls and decor to make them happier, which brings more people in, and eventually Heroes, whom I also got a nice warm feeling from when they moved in, especially a cameo from the fantastic Sips_ :D. When a dungeon level gets cleared there's also that good feeling when you clean all the loot out and equip the village with better items to withstand the ever increasing sieges that want to ruin all your fun. Overall there's just a great feeling I get from getting things done right, it's oddly satisfying to watch all your little people mine out all the stone before converting it into a storage room for your builders so you can continue to build up the town walls to make it harder for the sieges from completely stomping all over all your work so far, and i got a really good chuckle when the nasty hoard of yeti coming in to storm the place is almost completely wiped out before they reach their victims because you built a bridge that serves as the only way in that's completely lined with traps, and watching them set them all off (sadly there's no real animation, but it's still great to watch a big bad yeti get his foot caught in a bear trap and his friend who walked on ahead set off the bamboo shooter, hitting them both as well as anyone else nearby, then the log traps finish off the already wounded, before the villagers team up to pick off any surviving monsters that are likely bleeding from every possible area of their body. Perhaps next time they'll realize that the decaying goblin heads shoved on the pikes outside are a sign that this town is defended)If you already own a copy go ahead and have a blast directing all your little people to their fates. Grab some mods to fix some of the problems and some of the frustrating elements and you're good to go. If it appears in a bundle with some other things you're interested in, go ahead and give it a go, you might like it. But I would not buy this game through steam now, especially at full price, when there are more options available that either offer more polished development, are cheaper or promise so much more in the future. Gnomoria, Craft the World and Banished are all around the same price but all offer their own quirks and are still being developed regularly or are even finished in the case of Banished.The main reason I am not recommending this is because the devteam, they released a game which was basically in alpha, but not stating as such, they slowly developed said game over about a year, then dropped it. Now I can perfectly understand their situation, as one who actually browsed the forums, they got too deep into something they shouldn't have, their reputation was on the line, their own personal lives were causing them trouble. They hired another developer but their paycheck would have been so low that they too eventually dropped the project. When the game was left in this dropped state, the steam community went wild, with people buying the game just to give it a negative review, the product tags mostly consisting of ""scam"" and ""abandoned"" and the reviews said nothing about the game. The development of the game has since continued, however i would still not buy this game until they can promise to the buyers that they can bring out frequent updates (updates as of late have been very minor and slow, but a v15 is in development to help fix some issues)So until then, if you have it already, have fun, otherwise it's probably best to stay away unless it's on sale for £3 and you're curious or have nothing better to do for a rainy weekend. Then again, if the devs do get off their butts and finish the game, this could possibly be one of the best entry level Dwarf Fortress clones ever..."

I have bought numerous early access games ( Prison Architect, Starbound, Space Base DF9 (ugh), Kerbal SPace Program etc.) Some have been solid games that keep building on themselves and are enjoyable even in early alpha (like KSP), some have been rocky but still enjoyable and are continuing to be made and starting to look better (Starbound), and then there are the games that don't really evolve much and kind of just.... stop.I bought this game around the release date thinking that it was a neat fresh look at dungeon crawling with city building and some basic logistics managment. I was totally jazzed at the idea and played the game into the ground for a couple of weeks. I had a bit of trouble with the building system, but I figured that had more to do with me being a n00b at the game. (It was a mess since your villagers could get stuck on air and kinda just... sat there as they got eaten by the critters and such on the surface.),. To be fair though there wasn't a tutorial at all at the time.I also found it impossible to attract addidtional villagers to the town or any heroes, even after fitting all of the criterea that the wiki said was required. The lack of forward movement gameplaywise is what lead me to drop the game until it hit beta.Now many moons later I come back to check out what is up with a game that I wanted so much to love and find out that it has been pretty much dropped by the devs. I liken it to ordering a car from somewhere and stopping by for a test drive of a prototype. You drive it and think it's all cool and can't wait for the consumer model, but after hearing nothing for a while you drop by again to see how the car is coming and the one they let you drive is exactly the same except they added seatbelts. Granted that I didn't drop $20,000 on this game and that this game is not a car, you get pretty much the same feeling, like someone took your money and gave you a shoddy product.If only I knew then what I know now.TL;DRShoddy at best and the devs dropped the game."

The developer cashed the money in, which was brought by many people, who were exicted (like me), to try it, to play it and to support it. But unfortunately the developement stopped in 2014.What's wrong with that?So the problem with this is, that this game is far from being finished. This game is still in alpha and lacks many features, so many that you could rather say it is not much fun to play this game.

I burned myself on this game and on some other. I would recommend for everyone not to buy early acess games or greenlights, just as they appear, but to wait and watch or to look at reviews. We gamers have to put a stop to such methods, we can not allow this to happen to us anymore!I do not recommend this game, don't buy it and don't support someone who disappointed thousands of players, with an unfinished, not even polished, game.

I got the game when it first came out (before you could purchase beta access to games). The game was difficult to figure out and very clearly incomplete. At the time it hadn't claimed to be anything other than complete so I was surprised by the alpha phase feel of the game. The tutorial wasn't clear or useful and I had to take to the internet to learn how to play.The UI is awful and looks largely like it is meant as a placeholder until the game is further along and finished. The game is still not finished. The last update released for the game as of this writing (12/6/2013) was 9/30. That update made some things better, but didn't really affect the problems, such as the weirdness with townies auto-equipping things, the awful UI, the terrible tutorial, the stupid pathing and ai, the cruddy combat system etc.I was really looking forward to this game because it is similar in spirit to games like Dwarf Fortress and Dungeon Keeper, but it fails miserably and doesn't seem to be trying all that much. If you are a fan of DF or DK, I suggest just playing either of them, or try Gnomoria. Gnomoria is regularly updated and communicative with the player base. Don't get this game unless you are the kind of person who gets a kick out of bad games.Update 8/19/2015:Just wanted to add that as far as anyone can tell, the developers have abandoned this project and Steam continues to leave it up where it can still be sold. If you made the easy mistake of purchasing this game thinking it is complete or being worked on, please keep in mind you can refund games now and refund as soon as possible.

Each of said creatures seems to inherently wish to destroy the little ""Townies"" that inhabit the locale.Thus it is up to you to assign duties and crafts in order to farm, harvest, bake, mine, and provide a kind of economy of barter in order to sustain the townspeople from starving, or being slaughtered and eaten by local denizens.After creating a working village, whether it be in a mountainside or under the ground, or whatever the case, townies can venture below, into the earth to unveil treasures from creatures, with or without the help of heroes attained from local taverns.With certain mods, the game can be improved, but what with the care given to it, the modding community has very well moved on; it has been left aside and is a token of proof against the usefullness of buying games before their true completion.Other games similar to this are Gnomoria, and Stonehearth, both of which brandish better Ai development and offer a team who is in love with the product they are creating.I would only recommend trying this game if it were on sale at 80% off if you wish to give a town-simulator a try; but I personally would have preferred buying Gnomoria over this game."

,Not Recommended,221020,7776190,"Posted: 26 November, 2013",all,arleas,"Ok, having reviewed the game again, it still seems to me like this is a very hit or miss game.  On the one hand, it's a game with the interesting premise that you're creating a town to attract heroes to fight in the dungeons that are invariably discovered beneath the town.  On the other hand, it's bogged down by horrible micromanagement through clunky menus.Before you find yourself running a town worthy of adventurers coming to visit, you have to BUILD the town.  You start with a handful of people standing around with their thumbs up their asses waiting for you to tell them what to do.  You tell them to grab some fruit and put it over there in a patch of ground we'll call a stockpile.  You tell them to chop down trees and put the wood over there in a different stockpile.  You designate certain areas of ground as a room for various purposes and then have to figure out what order you're required to build the furniture for these rooms.So you want beds for your people to sleep in?  You're gonna need a carpentry bench in a carpentry zone.  What about food more filling than apples and pears?  I guess you're gonna need a baking table and a baking oven in a baking zone.  But wait; there's something about this baking oven being made out of stone.  Now you're going to need a masonry room and an appropriate table in an appropriate zone.This kind of crap takes place all the time in this game. Oh and it's also set to some mind numbing repetitive music barely above ""bad midi song"" level. The characters themselves aren't very well animated and most might as well be colored stick figures.  I mean, you tell your guys to chop down a tree...do you see them pull out an axe and swing it at the trunk?  No, you see them stand next to a tree for a few minutes while a chopping sound effect is played and then you're treated to your character hauling a log across the map to a stockpile (if you bothered to make one).This game has a lot of promise and I've actually had this game since it was ""officially released"" waiting for it to live up to that promise.  It hasn't done it yet.  Oh and about that official release:  It basically went from alpha to final release overnight.  Had steam's ""Early Access"" been a thing at the time it would have been a perfect candidate for it.  Instead they released it as if it were done when just a day before it was ""alpha"" quality...but again, that wasn't really an option for them and they were desperate to make sales.Now, in the time since the game went ""live"" on steam to the writing of this review, they've put up a few updates and it does look like they've fixed a few things here and there, but it hasn't changed to the point where I could wholeheartedly say ""yes, buy this game!""  It's still got a rough and unfinished feel to it, and if they'd take some time to polish up the UI, add some more variety to the music, and redo most of the graphics, it would at least look like they've made some progress.  Instead it's all ""under the hood"" stuff with very little outward change from the earliest version on Steam.If despite all of this you're still willing to buy the game, yes, you can easily sink 10-20 hours into it (I've almost sunk 20 into it when it was in its most broken state) because you get that feeling that somehow you're slowly making progress in the game and building something.  It's not entirely unsatisfying...it's just not entirely satisfying either.  If you buy it, lower your expectations and I'm sure this game will meet those lowered expecations and maybe even surpass them.  If instead you go into it expecting a great and polished game from the start, you'll be let down hard."

This game has become one of the only games I regret purchasing.Likely the creators and developers do not have enough support, and things probably got too complicated. While I understand everyone and all developers have their own life and their own needs, I've seen so little effort into updating this game and bringing it back to life that it feels like the entire project is dead to them.It's sad when this happens to games.

If you find this game at $5 or less, then think about it, but any more than that and you might want to find something that got finished. This review is based off of my experience and the regular price though, so overall I don't recommend it. There's no way there isn't better games out there than this.Let me start with what I found to be good about the game though, since I did technically like it. I never played this Gnomoria that everyone else is mentioning, and with little function in Minecraft for watching a village come to life even with mods, I found it to be a great idea. Even though it was immediately obvious from opening the game that it was far from finished I found myself enjoying finding different combinations and ways of getting my limited villagers to survive.Secondly, the zoning. By assigning a zone type to an area the area gains a particular function, while losing other functions. This makes building a city kind of cool because the buildings one makes will actually function the way that they've zoned it to. Added to the fact that, if one could figure out the menus easily, one could get the villagers to use and upkeep these zones automatically, without any help from the player.Then there's just the world in general. Although the maps are small, they generate well, and they're fun and easy to shape. If a player shows enough patience, it actually is possible to build the kinds of places they show in the promotional material and screenshots.The last thing I thought was really cool was being able to put writing on tombstones and books and things. I can go through my village and remind myself of the events that passed. Who died, who did the best, or helped the most – it felt like making a civilization, even though it was really just a town at best. Epic legacies in a tiny town.Now, the wonderful negatives that ruined it. Unfortunately there are a lot of these, so I'll put a chunk of them in point form;*Odd menu style. That took a while to get used too, and I feel like things could be implemented better.*Moving items is a hassle, or just plain confusing.*Can't place enough text in books, graves, signs, etc, and can't use characters like “/”, making labels and text look flat and odd, like they were written by some 10 year old that was too lazy to use any punctuation. Breaks immersion.*The use of scaffold isn't clearly stated to be useful, and so it can be difficult to find out about it and how to use it properly to build better buildings. There isn't a lot of direct help on the internet either, so simply building can be a hassle. Also, making second floors is too tricky.*Extremely limited character sprites. Everyone will have too many clones for you to care about them. They also all have weird french-sounding names, even if playing the English version, and though unimportant, feels like it takes away from immersion into the game.*The armour doesn't fit on the sprites properly. Sometimes this is funny, but it just isn't proper for a game that costs $15.*The first floor dungeons, though easy to pass, are too expansive and too full of monsters. There's no easing into it at all, making the game feel less thought-out and more slapped together. Also an immersion breaker.*Next to no updates. These people probably don't care anymore, and it's showing. They don't update anywhere near as much as they should, and some of the bugs in the game could really use some fixes.*The bugs. Seriously, the game is definitely not a finished product. Amusing, but certainly not finished.And lastly, though kind of silly, what I found to be the game-breaker;The weapons you make, buy, and find are cool and all, but it isn't hard for some ""hero"" to waltz by and take all your good stuff, leaving your citizens and soldiers pretty close to defenceless. Some heroes. I worked hard on that stuff. “That hat was for the blacksmith!” and “she needed that spear to save her life!” might become alarmingly common frustrations.So yeah. Ends up under $5? It'll amuse you long enough. $15? It's cute, but it ain't that cute, just go back to your Minecraft mods and this ""Gnomoria"" everyone else is talking about."

Instead, everything is implemented in a basic way that for some reason just doesn't work, and ends up being a cluster♥♥♥♥, to put bluntly. The screenshots showcasing busy townfolk running around a bustling city look amazing, but don't be fooled: whilst it's true a picture says a thousand words, gameplay says a thousand words + 1.The graphics, well, it looks like it was made in the early 90s,there were a few games using similar painted-art style, but I can't remember their names. The interface is ugly and obstructive, thankfully though the buttons can be minimised. The entire game looks like a free game you play on those Flash sites. Not necessarily bad I must add, but surely if they took a backseat towards the visual department, then they could have pumped more beans into the gameplay side of things? Apparently not.Main game problem: Artificial Intelligence. The villagers lack any kind of soul and brain, that makes the NPCs in Doom and Quake more likeable.They'll randomly dart across the landscape for no apparent reason, and the way they slide across the place looks freaky. They have no goals and just stand there doing nothing, permanently frozen in an upright stance for eternity (except when they die they rotate 90 degrees). Order them to chop down a forest, and they'll just fly towards the area en mass, stand completely motionless in front of the tree and it magically dissapears, through use of sound effects. Couldn't they at least have the sprite of an axe in their hand?About their intelligence, they just come across as mindless drones.Granted, they actually do a very good job of following orders: ask them to hack down some trees, mine some rock and what not, and they'll literally drop everything, rush towards the area like a bunch of gophers and gleefully carry out said task until it's done. If only public service workers in real life were as committed as these folk are.On the other hand, the villagers lack any sense of self preservation.They'll often, for no reason at all, decide to wonder to the complete opposite end of the map and get killed (or♥♥♥♥♥♥♥rather, due to the bad animations) by some high level monsters. Then again for some unknown reason, another villager will decide it's their turn to dash to the other end of the map and repeat this morbid process. It's extremely frustrating as there is no explanation nor solution to this phenomenon, I've actually lost an entire village due to this sick process. If it's not a bug and actually some invisible monster using mind control on my villagers to turn them into suicidal lemmings, than I do apologise.Remember when I said before about game features being basic, yet for some reason not actually working?Well here's an example. I tell a villager to go bake some bread, he does so without delay. Next to the bakery is a designated area for storing bread. Said villager then bakes the bread, and takes the finish products to the store room. Simple right? What actually happens is SOME bread gets put in the store room, whilst the rest is just littering the floor of the bakery, for no explained reason. And now the villagers are eating the bread off the dirty floor INSTEAD of the stockpile, despite the stockpile being closer to them. And again for some unknown reason, some of the villagers decide to find food in the dangerous jungles be yonder, rather than pluck it from the safety of their own town. Maybe they suffer from wheat and gluten allergy?OK, good things. City building is decent enough, as the villagers will happily carry out construction, even when they are dying of starvation:a problem with other city building games is that sometimes buildings weren't been built because the villagers were too busy with other trivial tasks or ""idleing"", so props to Towns for fixing this common issue (even if it's due to bad AI). You can custom build your houses block by block, choosing a variety of different colours, furniture, etc, and decorate the surrounding area with plants and other decorations. So in essence, Towns does actually deliver what the name implies, assuming you can get past the bugs and terrible AI, and the fact is you need the AI to get the most out of Towns.Finally, there is only one, ONE single 2 or so minute long music loop that plays throughout the entire game.Do yourself a favour, switch that damn thing off and play something in the background of Youtube, as this single endless loop will drive you absolutely insane.Towns is a massive disappointment, considering the hype and broken promises the developers blew around.It actually got abandoned after it was pushed out of beta and into its final, albeit broken release state. I guess they jumped onto the city building craze every other indie game was doing, but didn't have the know-how on how to actually make a game properly. It's a colossus shame as Towns could have very well become a massive hit and a new standard for village building games. If the original developers were to release the game engine/source code for open modification, that could potentially completely turn this game into a success as I bet there's many talented people out there just hoping to get their hands on this and fix all the problems.There's tons of other similar games that does everything way better. And for the record, to end the Towns vs Gnomoria debate, Gnomoria wins tenfold. At the time of writing, I've only spent 3 hours in Towns, as opposed to 65 hours in Gnomoria. Don't need to say more."

Any flaws, problems or glitches will not be fixed.Towns might have been the first Early Access game I've ever bought and it made me skeptical and wary of all future Early Access titles. It has a great premise that is executed poorly and although you might have a bit of fun with it for a few hours, there is little here to recommend an indepth playthrough.I don't mind isometric, retroish graphics but these are, more often than not, absolutely annoying to look at. Towns has gone for a sort of Populus/Simcity kind of look, all graphical tilesets and while I think some of it works, particularly outside of the Town in the woods and forest, it often just looks totally ugly. There's no definition or clear sense of layering; what lies in front of things and behind other things can be really hard to tell. When you do have a Town, it all runs together and looks like someone who just found out they can download Final Fantasy sprites and has mashed them all together. Certain textures really grate on the eyes, particularly the water texture which you see a lot of.Controlling this game isn't much better as the inteface is awful.  I've played a lot of games with clunky interfaces and struggled my way through them but this might be one of the worst. Absolutely nothing about it works properly; you'll probably have to hit every key on the keyboard to figure out what does what and even then, attempting to divine the systems that control anything in this game is like trying to scry the future or turn lead into gold.Towns had a lot of potential for growth (with a bad launch, but hey, potential?) - I mean, running a town built over a dungeon and attracting heroes, managing the enemies that come out, building the town up with facilities for the adventurers? It sounds like a perfect blend of Recettear, Diablo and Dungeon Keeper. But this is not that; Towns is a shoddy, abandoned game with very little to recommend it. It usually comes on sale for 7.49, discounted down from 14.99. It is not worth playing at either price and the fact they want you to pay $15 dollars for an abandoned game is repulsive. You shouldn't be paying for abandonware - speak with your wallet and say no to Towns.NOTE: Steam shows 0.1 hours on record but I know for a fact I played at least a day of this - it felt longer, honestly, but trust me you don't need a whole day to see the flaws in this one."

Here we are 3 years later and the verdict is very different. I could go on with basically the same stuff that the other reviews have said, but TLDR:The devs abandoned the game. It is buggy and incomplete. The devs have censored basically all negativity and criticism in about the game and it very much seems a case of them taking the money and running."

Nothing seems to work quite as intended, the UI is a little finicky, mouse clicks don't always register in the right place (if at all), and digging is a nightmare. The further down you dig, the more erratic the mouse behavior becomes.At 15$, I'd say the price is steep -- comparing to Minecraft, which released at a similar price, the level of functionality is far less. Though then again, the requisite functionality is far greater in the case of Towns. However, this game is flawed for a far simpler reason, it was released onto steam with no notice that it was an unfinished, alpha game -- I'm an alpha-player, I love to play and watch as a game evolves, and I am _more likely_ to purchase an alpha game than many non-alpha games. I know many of my friends feel the same way, but  this game released to steam (via Greenlight) purporting to be a fully-ready 1.0 release, and that's just not what it is.I say wait. Maybe get it if the price drops to the 2-5$ range.

Something better or newer will come out to take it's place.The developer insisted that the product is playable upon time of release, after Early Access was terminated. While the game was playable, the words were decieiving. A playable game should not be released if there are still countless bugs to be fixed and several key features that have not been added to the game.It's such a shame, because the game had great potential and an idea for a somewhat unique mechanic. But I can't recommend this game to anyone, unless you are looking for examples of how a good concept can go bad, learn the idea, and take time to figure out how to improve upon it with your own game.

Buggy, unbalanced, and with many obvious missing features; it compares badly with many games currently available in the same genre, many cheaper and some free.Current price is £9.99, which is insane- almost twice the current price of Gnomoria.

It seems like the developers just don't care or hoping that modders can fix everything for them.LIke every other games in the same genre that's on greenlight, AI in this game is poor.and there's a breakdown of their ""about the game"" info page on steam""The game brings a fresh new take on the city building/management genre by introducing many RPG features. ""Nope, there are many others just like it, the game is heavily inspired by many other game and it offers nothing ""fresh"" and ""new"".""n Towns you manage a settlement on top of an active dungeon. Instead of playing the hero who delves deep into the dungeon, how about playing the town that houses and caters to the hero's needs?""Heroes don't need jack. All it takes to attract heroes is to boost your population and have an area set up as ""tavern"". The ""tavern"" area doesn't have to be enclosed. Meaning that heores will be perfectly fine sleeping on the ground looking at stars just because you painted a 3x3 block purple and called it ""inn"".There is no intereaction between your townsfolk and heroes at all. They have very poor AI and die very easily if you are new to the game. Gearing up these heroes is not an easy process and sometimes random. You need to put the items on their path or ""hangout"" area and hope that they pick up the gear you want them to wear.""Both the RPG and strategic aspects will be fleshed out over a series of sprawling dungeons.""The only RPG elements involved in the dungeons is ""there are mobs, they drop loot"". The only strategic aspect of the game is ""pray to the gods that when you dig down, you don't dig directly into a group of mobs because your townsfolk are dumb and they will not flee"" and ""dig open dungeon walls bit by bit and hope your townsfolk don't try to engage the mobs""There is minimun strategy and minimun RPG elements in this game. Townsfolk has a hunger bar, a sleep bar and a happiness bar and that's it. There is no ""leveling"" for your townsfolk and leveling for heores is meaningless.""Attract travelling heroes that will independently explore the dungeons below, fight off monsters, gain levels, special skills and collect the best loot they can find in order to clear the land of all evil!""Like stated above, there is no interactions between you and the heroes.About the loots, here's the funny part. Once you clear a dungeon, it's best not to collect loot from the dungeon because there's a billion of trash loot lying on the ground. Heroes will pick up gears when they feel like it. It's best to leave those in the dungeon.The best loot is often not dropped in the dungeon. Once you have a market set up, travelling merchants will come and they will randomly sell you the best gear in the game. So in order to get the best loot in game, you priorites a market over anything else. Regardless your progression in the game, you will be able to buy best gears purely based on luck.""Craft unique weapons, trade with exotic items, obtain randomized loot, set up devious death traps and build a settlement capable of holding back the forces that come up from the depths!""Mobs in the dungeon will come to your town only when a hero engages them with low health and decides to run away. Those mobs will not stop chasing the fleeing hero until one of them is dead. This normally leads to a few townies dying because of the poorly designed AI.There is nothing unique about the weapon and item designs. They are very generic items. I wouldn't describe loots to be ""randomized"". 90% of them are trash loots and 99% of them are just junk on the ground waiting to be sold when a merchant arrives (if that merchant has enough money and willing to buy these crap. normally they just don't want them at all).In summary, this game is not worth its asking price. Yes, it's about the price of a very fancy subway sandwitch in Canada but I assure you that you will get more satisfaction out of that sandwitch than this game. If you are desprately looking for a game like this, wait for it to go on sale and do not expect any updates because it's not very likely.There is a modding scene for this game. It's small and I suggest you to go to their forum and check out more information there. Simply google ""towns"" and you'll be able to access their website and forum.Thank you."

,Not Recommended,221020,13374459,"Posted: 14 December, 2014",all,dj_moyer,"The bottom line:  This game has an interesting premise.  Rather than casting you as the hero who goes into the dungeons in search of fame and glory, you are in charge of building and organizing the town above the dungeon where the hero rents his hotel room and buys his weapons.  That said, this game really isn't as much fun as it sounds.  It is an extensive exercise in MICRO-MANAGEMENT.  If you can get it for REALLY REALLY CHEAP, then it's worth playing if you enjoy games like the original Warcraft (the original, not WoW!!) or Sim City.  I have to say though, I am not a fan of any game where the townsfolk will starve to death if you just leave them alone for a while.You start out with a handful of citizens and absolutely no town.  Your first 4 hours of play will be dedicated to gathering food and setting up a farm so your citizens don't starve to death (which they will do QUITE OFTEN if you are not paying attention!!).  Your next 6 hours of play will be dedicated to mining a few piles of rock and mud, chopping down a few trees, and building some basic workshops for your citizens to work in.  Then you'll spend another 3 hours setting up a kitchen and a bakery, as well as some animal farms so your people can eat something besides apples.  Only after that will you worry about building a tavern for traveling heroes to stay and eat at.  And only after THAT will you start digging down into the dungeon.  Digging into the dungeon and having a tavern with at least one open tavern bedroom are the requirements for heroes to start coming to your town.  Different types of heroes will come based on how deep into the dungeon you are, how many people live in your town, and what type of furniture you have in the tavern bedroom.  Once you do get into the dungeons, there are a ton of monsters which will probably kill everyone who finds their way down the  tunnel.  But there are more resources in the dungeon that you can't find on the surface, like iron, copper, silver, and gold... and you need a ton of those to build better weapons and armor for your city guards.  Meanwhile, you might randomly have a Werepig go berserk on your town and KILL EVERYONE, or you might have a sudden invasion by monsters from the forest and THEY ALL DIE.  But NEVER FORGET... the number one priority AT ALL TIMES has to be food production or else your entire city will starve because the citizens are as stupid as rocks.One good thing about this game is that it is VERY EASY to create mods for it.  You can mess with the amount and placement of various resources, enemies, even mountains and plants.  If you want to get deeper into the config files, you can even change the number of citizens you start with, alter citizen and hero attributes, and even alter enemies to make them easier or harder."

Towns has the potential to be that awesome crossover, but it is not.Although listed as a finished game it feels very much as an Alpha. The control over the ""Townies"" is extremely limtied, and each map begins the same way : a horrible struggle.The question is why is it a horrible struggle? Right off the bat there are a number of monsters covering the surface of the map, many are able to kill a townie 1 versus 1. The townies will engage anything they encoutner and unlike the ""Heroes"" do not ever disengage until one of them is dead. So very early on your main task is gathering resources but in very controlled ways to avoid your townies by chance encounter a monster.So you lost some townies, how does one get them back? Well you will need to have rooms built individually for each town plus any extras you want, they must be well furnished and food must flow in abundance, this together allows them to maintain their happiness which will entice others to join. Here is the kicker: work quickly saps happiness, so when you lose a townie or two the others must work twice as hard to provide happiness. I am sure you can see the paradox happenning.Ofcourse many other small time problems persist throughout the game which make building anything close to the promos provided to be a long, long way away. Sure this sounds like the right approach, you cannot build a city over night, but the truth is you will spend many weeks before seeing anything resembling a couple huts.In conclusion this game was greenlit with the hopes of it being grown, expanded and ultiamtely polished. Here is how it looks.Greenlit - September 11th, 2012Last Monthly Update - September 21th, 2013Date of Review - June 24th, 2014It has been nearly a year to the date of this review since anything signficant was changed and it will be a surprise to see another."

It has ripped off too many people.Towns is a game about building a village for simulated RPG adventurers. Reading about all the features it had and all the downloads, I figured I would throw in my $5 and play. This is 2013 by the way. Unfortunately, the game was unplayable. With a glitchy interface and the inability to even pass the tutorial or even build one room.A few months passed from August 2013 and Steam decides to release Green Light, I service indicating which games are incomplete but still up for purchase. To my surprise, Towns was lumped into the newly founded category. Basically, I bought a game I did not know was incomplete. The optimistic side of me thought that Towns would be complete some time in the future.Fast forward a year to 2014 and I see news that Towns developers gave up on ever finishing the game. Meaning they simply took off with my money.http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/217154/Alphafunded_Steam_game_Towns_abandoned_by_devs.phpUpon hearing the news, I was again disappointed.The following year, Steam released a refund policy. I was excited to read that they would allow refunds that were within 14 days with less than one hour of play time. Given that I have clocked a whopping, miserable 19 minutes on Towns, I figured I could do one last attempt.... DENIED.So here I am, writing about how much I have been ripped off from buying the game Towns. It was $5 sure, but I didn't know it was incomplete at the time and Steam fails to acknowledge their mistake.I hope this is the right forum to post to because quite frankly, I feel people should know the darker side that is Steam.Moral of the story.DO NOT BUY TOWNS"

Infact, since there is no ingame help of any kind, you will be going to the internet to figure out some mechanics of this game.Villager path finding is always shortest route, regardless of danger. Hostile NPC's do have random and specific spawns, but more often then not I feel they are hunting me down.Building is somewhat confusing till you get the hang of it. The only drawback is, if you don't build in small sections the game seems to hang on larger designs. The same goes for most the resource managment. Even after giving out specific jobs, and setting priority's all my villagers do is eat and sleep.Fact is, this game has loads of pontential. But fails to deliver.

Starting on a blank slate here, maybe?Let's be honest: The premise of Towns is as quirky as it is unique: You build a fantasy town OVER a monster-filled dungeon, so that heroes will come and explore said dungeon- and with your town being endared by the monsters but at the same time able to provide important services to the heroes the game clearly has a tongue-in-cheek approach to both town-building and fantasy tropes in general.Let's be honest: This is an early access game. So you can expect it isn't done yet. It allows you to build a diverse range of buildings and services, and heroes do occasionally pop up and do their thing, and yes, there are monsters.And that is the catch, the premise is really interesting but at this stage, the features that are in don't make for a very interesting game."

This is a game breaking flaw.2: If you have harvesting set as a higher priority than cooking, your peope will eat the raw food instead of cooking it.3: If you have item crafting set as a higher priority than chopping, your people will often times not bother to chop trees in tree farm to make stiff with.4: After a couple hours of game play, your people will only do the top 2 or 3 proprity chores, and ignore everything else.5: Never cook anything that requires 2 or more different ingrediants. People will often times stoop what they are doing, and the ingrediants they are ""holding"" dissapears.6: People often times drop what they are carrying and go do somethign else.7: People will almost neve use a stock pile or container, reguardless of how close by it is.8: Some times people stop doing a chore, and what ever they have in their ""hands"" dissapears.9: There are no sprite animations for sleeping, sitting down, fighting, chopping, harvesting, or doing chores.10: The AI is too stupid to eat when hungry most of the time. If cooking and gathering are not your 2 top prioritys, your entire population will eventually starve to death.11: An infinate loop of ""gathering - cooking - eating"" happens WAY too often, mostly caused by the short hunger cycle. This happens reguardless how filling the food is.12: Raw and prepared food containers do not work.I just bought this game yesterday, and have been spending many hours tryng to figure out how to play the game around all the issues.I want my wasted time back."

If you are looking to spend a long time building and making slow or no progress this is it. There are a few tricks to pick up that allows you to actually achieve some progress but due to the programming allowing your townies to starve because they have traveled to far, or gotten themselves stuck its still a slow and frustrating game. I keep hoping that the developers will adress some of these issues and still nothing. The food issue is the worst as you can do nothing to adjust for it, once you go into the ground mining and exploring your townies will die and fast. The values for food and sleep run down to swiftly, and outside of stopping your townies from digging completely you can not keep them from entering the depths where once you go ten levels down they die from starvation. Some of the tools are intriguing, and fun to play with as long as you refrain from going past -10 in digging. Once you come to terms with these drawbacks its a fun little game. Oh yea to clear out the monsters in the dungeons you do get heros yet they are completely random and you must account for them as being three population wise thats how hard they hit your food supply.

This game really gave me some good time, cause i like the freedom in which you're able to build up a town, the retroish graphics and the possibility to alter the game due editing some xml files. Unfortunately the problems start right there: Since the engine limits the world to a 64*64 cube, you have to choose between dungeon roaming and building high up in the air, when altering the world generation (only a change in values). Last one is my favorite playstyle... or: would be, if the engine would not getting annoyingly laggy with more than 12 surface leves. There seem to be too many transparent blocks which affects the game as soon as you are giving more than two orders to your Townies. So, i am just not able to build high buildings without having a second lag, a second none, a second lag, a sec.. you get it. And that ""really grinds my gears"".Also, the menu is crap and the tutorial basically only explains how to move your mouse from left to right and bottom to top. Furthermore, there are some serious bugs, which are a total pain in the a**. Check out the Community Hub's discussion to get an idea of them, it is a long list.And yes, the devs spoofed those who bought this game, cause updates came in irregularily, were minor and the communication to us customers is worth mentioning.At the moment rumors say the devs are looking for someone new to heritage this project.

Nothing in this game hadn't been done before, but it brought a lot of things together in an enjoyable package, and new content was being brought out that added facets to the idea of managing a town catering to adventurers and trying to survive the dangers of a D&D world. Now, the game is exactly the same. That's the problem; the end of Towns' beta came purely because the dev wanted more sales for less work.It's really too bad that the development of this game became something of a hot potato due to fewer sales than the original developer wanted. Towns was developing in an interesting direction, and at the end of the updates had started introducing some enjoyably complicated ways to use basic water channels to make tasks easier. However, it never got to a fully mature stage, instead slowly petering out with updates being smaller and much less often. Eventually, after everyone assumed the dev had already walked away, it was pawned off to make a little more money, to someone who promised new updates but never delivered.A lot of people are saying not to buy this game because it has been abandoned, and at full price I back that up. But I enjoy it still from time to time, knowing full well what kind of game it is. Maybe you will too?My recommendation to buy this game comes with the caveat that you should look more closely at what it is, maybe scan through the wiki, and see if you might enjoy it. You can always try it out for an hour, then refund it, you know? But for god's sake don't pay $15 dollars for this, $5 at most. Something to stick on the wishlist and pick up during a steam sale."

Timber and Stone: The lesser of the two but still a good game with a better combat system for those people who want to fight more enemies >:D2. Stonehearth: Stonehearth is (In my opinion) the gem with good graphics and a nice city building style. You will still be harrased but less so than in Timber and Stone but they will be changing that soon."

,Not Recommended,221020,8062089,"Posted: 15 December, 2013",all,thunderw,"From initial release the dev team of this game has mislead customers on Steam.  Initally it was released as a complete and playable version.  However, it hadn't hit it's full version number in beta yet.  The UI was terribly implemented, the pathing, AI, inclusion of god hand mechanics to work around lazy coding problems, and a plethora of truly unproffessional issues plagued the game.  To top it all off, there wasn't a patch for almost 4 months after release.  Last December the Dev threatened to quit the game and then quickly changed his mind during the holiday sale.  Since that initial release there has only been 5 patches of minimal consequence to ongoing issues of the game - in fact trying to add features to an already broken game has caused even more problems than before.Even though now that the Store Page has been updated to read, ""Towns is continually being developed and updated to bring you the best experience possible,"" it simply isn't.  You can go months with zero dev updates on their work.  Patches are released up to 5 months period in between patches.  None of the prior mechanics implementations have been fixed.  And now the dev is saying he is trying to hire another coder.....The owner of this game is a self admitted full time employee of another company.  He has said on more than one occasion that they can't keep up with updates cause they have to work their jobs.  Don't support a game where the devs are not committed to it.  Let it die, and perhaps some of the more fanatic fans can take the code and do something legitimate with it."

,Recommended,221020,12031424,"Posted: 8 September, 2014",all,Zstan,"Ok, first off, I just want to say that this review should be taken with a pinch of salt. This game has had an intense history for the time it's been around, and after witnessing a fair bit of it first-hand, I can say it wasn't pretty. I'll explain further on, as it does actually have a small amount to do with this review, but for now, let's get to it: Is the game good, and what's it about?What is Towns?: Towns is a top-down isometric strategy-RPG-simulation thingymabob. Most easily compared to Dwarf Fortress, it contains similar mechanics but without as much complexity. You control a small group of townies which require food, shelter, and equipment to survive. The world contains many dangers that will constantly threaten your civilization as you explore the underground dungeon for sweet loot, and farm the terrain to create vast fields of food. Everything can be controlled with your mouse with ease, from planting and building to digging and fighting. Of course, if you want to use those hotkeys to be a bit faster, then I don't blame you. You'll probably need them. While the art style may not be to everyone's taste, it's easy on the eyes and makes the world interesting to look at, providing you with plenty of colors to play with and enjoy.Reasons it's good: I've personally been a big fan of games like these since I found dwarf fortress a while back. So, I decided to pick this game up on sale and give it a bash. And I can honestly say I had fun. The overall simplicity of it made it easy for me to jump into it and understand most of what was going on right off the bat (though that may be in-part from having played similar games before-hand). The game looks pretty good most of the time, the blocks you can use to build have a lot of variation and color to them, so you can create some really nice looking builds. The A.I. has been a bit derpy sometimes, and I found myself often needing to fiddle with what my townies were doing regularly, but that's kinda what you'd expect to put up with when going into a game like this. When it boils down to it, I don't think towns is a game meant to be played with a hardcore mindset like one would play Dwarf Fortress with. The game is a lot simpler, and I found it to be a good game to play on my laptop in bed before going to sleep.Reasons it's bad: Now, some of the things that were good about it, worked kind of liked a double-edged sword. Yes, I had to fiddle with my little civilization, but it wasn't on things I wanted to do. Usually I had to deal with occasionally derpy A.I. that did silly things like leave items laying around that needed to be stored, or not building things correctly. Granted, these were problems I had some time ago. I haven't played much of the game recently (which I'll explain why in a moment), so I do believe some of those A.I. issues may have been resolved. The art style, while nice and simple, is maybe too simple, and could've used something to make it feel a bit more... energetic maybe? I guess beauty lies in the eyes of the beholder, but I think most people would agree that it's not a fabulous looking game. Good, but not fabulous. The simplicity, while nice for this game, could've used a few more things. Maybe a quest system, or thirst. Perhaps bigger maps would've even helped. Just some stuff to make it feel a bit meatier is all. Now, if you haven't figured it out yet, you should be wary of the game's history. If you want to dig deeper into it, go read the game's forums or discussions in the community hub. A VERY small summary of it could be boiled down to: The dev's got burnt out, people got upset, game slowed to a near-death crawl, and hasn't really recovered. The updates are few and far between, mostly consisting of bug fixes and patches. So don't be too hopeful about new content for the game, since in all likelihood, this is about as close as it'll get to a final product.Final Thoughts: I really, really can't hate too much on this game. I had fun with it for the time I played it, and I got my money's worth. But I can't whole heartedly recommend it either (at least at full price), so if it's on sale for a few bucks, then by all means, pick it up and give it a shot. I really only lost ~5$ on the deal, so I'm not too sour about it. For 5$, it was a nice, relatively relaxing game. There is the issue of the game's future though. Honestly, I'm not going to be the optimist, because from what I've seen and heard, optimism won't change much, if anything. I will say though, that I don't believe calling the game dead or abandoned is suitable either. Perhaps we can say that the game has become a husk, an empty shell of sorts. Or perhaps even more correct, would be to say it's a game that's suffered grievous wounds. The game has a chance to recover, and to stand back on its own two feet. Will it ever be what people hoped for? I doubt it. Will the community ever fully recover? Probably not. But, sometimes these things happen. Being too optimistic for something that very well may end up as a dead game is just as harmful as calling it dead outright. I'd love to see this game get built upon, and see amazing thigns happen. But after the toxicity I've witnessed, I'm not sure it's realistic to expect this game to be any more than a game you play in bed for an hour or two to chill to with some music in the background and a nice beverage. So if the game's ever on sale, and you need a nice game to fall asleep to (Warning: do not fall asleep to this game. Shut it off, and THEN go to sleep, lest your town become a graveyard), then pick it up for a few bucks and maybe buy a new CD from your favorite band with the money you saved. Like I said earlier though, take this review with a pinch of salt. While it is much simpler than Dwarf Fortress, it still has those FUN* mechanics in there under the layers of color, loot, and vast quantities of skootenbeeten. If you're not into the idea of watching everything you build up die from rogue werepigs, then buy with caution.Side Note: As it is somewhat important, it should be noted that the lead developer has been the focus of a lot of the controversy surrounding this title. While this should not be a major factor in your decision of buying/not buying this game, I do recommend at least making yourself aware of the situation with the developers. The details can be found by hunting around in the forums and whatnot, but here's a small summary to at least give you an idea: The toxicity of the community can really be traced back to the almost non-existant PR of the developers. After tensions rose, the lead developer was accused of basically taking the money and running, leaving behind a game that to most people (myself included) seemed like little more than an early access title. After minimal updates, and a new Dev that didn't stick around, things weren't looking good for the game, and still aren't. So if you have problems with supporting a company that made some mistakes from day 1, and ended up making themselves look untrustworthy, then take an extra pinch of salt with your final decision. I do believe though that the game should be viewed as it is, which at this point is something more closely relatable to a game you'd play in bed as I said earlier, without believing that it's a horrible piece of abandonware. 'Cus really it's not. It's a small game, not meant to be played on a bigger, more hardcore scale. It's got enough depth to keep you busy for a few hours at least, but not enough to really justify spending elongated hours on it. Regardless of what the developers did, or what the community says, it's a nice little pick up to add to your library for a couple bucks on sale."

From the unique perspective to pleasing graphics it has the base to be a enjoyable time sink. Unfortunately the execution leaves a bit to be offered.The game itself is quite good. You control a group of townspeople who have started a town that happens to be on top of an active dungeon system. You go through the usual gathering and building phases, but are also tasked with dealing with monsters. As you begin to dig into the earth looking for resources you find caverns and tunnels populated by the genres classic baddies. Everything from spiders to ogres await you hapless townsfolk as they dig deeper. You have to build up a guard force to keep you town safe from these creatures, and at a certain point you can even attract ""adventurers"" that are much more powerful and able to really beat down some baddies. It's a fun mix of dungeon discovery and building and offers quite a bit of content as is.The bad part of it is that you can only pretty much count on it ""as is"" the ""early access"" part of this game is seriously slow. There have been exceptionally long gaps between developments, at some points even rumors development had stopped. Issues between developer and publisher have not helped things. So if you're willing to shell out for the game as it is now you will get quite a bit of content, just don't rest any solid hopes on it advancing. The chances of it ever actually being finished and brough inline with the initial goal of  the game is even less.Because of the issues I simply cannot recommend this game to someone. If there were regular updates and some progress towards completion I would completely back this game, but as I can't recommend a game I don't think is ever going to be completed for someone to buy."

I've been watching things go sour for quite a while now, and in light of these events I think I have reserved judgement for long enough.  Perhaps even too long.The developers released a good product, and sold hundreds of thousands of copies.  They actually grabbed the golden ring of indie game development.  Then they took that golden ring and chucked it in the swamp.It was rather obvious months ago that they were not serious about continuing to support the product that was released, especially as they repeatedly failed to deliver on expectations and sales declined.I hope they enjoy their money, it's obvious now that it is not going back into Towns development as was implied when I bought the game on Steam Early Access. I also hope they didn't spend it all, because I will never buy another game from these jokers after watching them get handed bags of cash during Steam Early Access only to have them fail to reinvest those funds to improve the product.I'm usually not this harsh, but watching developers squander success like this really pushes my buttons.I think it is time for me to abandon Towns, too."

For example, to get more villagers your villagers need to be happy.  Happiness is influenced by numerous factors, how nice their rooms are, what variety of things they have to eat, what kind of decorations they have to look at but also how much work they have to do.  If they have too much work they get stressed but if they have too little they get bored, there's no way to tell villagers how much of their time to spend relaxing and how much working (aside from a somewhat unpredictable job assignment system).

The commands are leaned towards automation so you dont have so much direct control, but enough for sure.Note: this game was supposedly made by one programmer and one artist and the programmer has allegedly quit this project (and there's rumors this project was never a high priority thing for him) so dont expect the bugs to be fixed. I did enjoy the game, but that's because I like to discover new things, even find out the game mechanics instead of having them explained to me. Anyone who feels differently, you shouldn't buy this game because there's a lot finding-out to do with game mechanics, and that's most likely not gonna change.The game mechanics work though, it's just a long try & fail process often. But you can also make up for your failures, like build new if buildings get destroyed (they shouldn't), get new villagers if old ones die (how compassionate) and even buy new animals from the visiting vendors.I feel this game has a lot of potential, but is poorly polished.

When describing Towns to people, I decided it was like telling 10 people how to play minecraft… but without the patterned crafting.  So much of minecraft is lived in telling someone where to put something in a 3x3 grid, but in towns you just say ""Go make a wooden sword"" and they must goto the wiki on their own and look it up.Towns places you in the traditional omniscient 3rd person viewing angle that Christ himself enjoys.   You get a randomly generated world with 11 citizens of your ""Town"".  You drop orders for what to do, and the citizens go do it.  Chop down all these trees I've moused over.  Harvest this apple tree.  Build this wall.  Dig this tunnel.  Oh crap, there's spiders in that tunnel.  No, no don't die… run away… crap.And then you start a new game and realize there's much more you need to do before you plumb the depths of your little block world.Towns is an impressively deep game where it does not appear to be on the surface.  I mean that literally as well as figuratively as while at the surface of the game it's about Townsperson happiness management (oh yea, they need to be happy, not over worked and if you can manage that, you'll get more people showing up in town… that's an important mechanic that I didn't think of until now… see… deep) and setting up replenishable resources so everyone doesn't starve and you've got plenty of wood for that epic barbarian castle you just dreamt up.  Dig down only a couple layers and there's combat to be had.  Not super impressive combat, just your people wiggling at the beast until one of them makes this strange death noise.  You can't control the combat at all.  Soldiers can be designated, even set on patrol routes, but they intervene somewhat rarely which makes taking them off labor to just stand around with the best sword you've made so far a little useless.Again, this game goes so much deeper than I'm giving it credit for in this review… suffice to say, it's quite enjoyable. If you like economy heavy RTS, dwarf-likes or civilization games give it a whirl.  I recommend buy-in at $10, but that's only because it's a little bit of a gamble as to wether you'll like it.  I'd be willing to give this game $25, but that's knowing how much I enjoy it after playing it for hours.4 Visuals8 Gameplay8 SlantOverall : 67"

MANY hours, and most of the 'towns' i created ended up bugged or lag-based on all accounts or glitched on load. So many faults, but i found it most likely i was building or mining something that was 'illegal' and had in previous versions faulted the game. New not good enough last ever update fixed some of the errors. My latest game or town i created, makes me rank this game AS WORTH HAVING, since no new updates are ever going to be created, possible it might be modified at some point some where on if... possibly nothing if or possible. The game recent, the only possible idea that could make this game work is more glabol control.Point 1,IF! if the game had an 'unlock all objects' key, which would be including those on top such as 2nd story roof and up, and scroll across the map, and a ignore all unlocked items, fading them from view so that you could rebuild as you expand, say 20 townies later on you might want to change the look of your town so that happiness is added more fluently(happiness draws in more townies, tip block all roads with fences and 1 block openings still fenced-in although the spot is used with a high happiness decoration, all townies must take the fensed roads, and always gain happiness, the fences should block line of sight too, for all other lower decorations that make your town unique looking and worth creating and blocking sight of other unhappy such stuff [corpses lol]!) so to wrap up point 1, once you build something expect to keep it, even if u realize you wasted a whole lotta space with little useless alleys that u got to block off anyways or whatever your reason. as well as each building wall block needs to be clicked to unlocked(why no auto unlock key?), It is fun to create brick by brick so to speak until you have clicked thousands and thousands of times, and you only have maybe 20 fully furnished and roofed structures(like 15% of the map if you build BIG), but where is the schematic page, where you can create and paste what you want.. I MEAN COME ON WTF stupid person could not add a schematic setup so that you do not neED to place brick by brick every damn BRICK. You might not understand the awesome happiness system, i do i love it, as is I gain 4 townies every few minutes until i reach about 100(ofcourse the townies live in unwalled unroofed houses with a single high happiness object each, only until later do i now design my town), maybe 2 hours of playing saying that at some point(in the past sometimes my game just would not load, or whateverbug at the time, since update final ive had almost no issues with bugs, sometimes lag after a while and i just have to restart towns game and its fixes) some point i dont lose my game and ok and i cap off my residents because i am tired of making the same structures to fit each part of my town, i make 80% the same with different base or roof designs. END POINT 1.Point 2.WTF my townies die for the most stupid reasons, and when one dies the rest follow, it takes 30 seconds for 1 high level enemy to sneak past a new hedge that grants access into your town to murder all of your townies before a single soldier townie arrives. The soldier system is laughable, the level system is worse, the townies ability to form soldier groups looks near identicle and stands on the screen right next to the 'return townies to civi status' and if you do that that once soldier loses all levels and expereienced gain. So two hours in my level 30 warrior reverts to lvl 1 cause i missclicked. Do i reload? wait i just cleared that floor and salvaged some structures (I do not want to reclick the structures brick by brick to move together to add more what/ever is needed floor layout). Its a bummer, the soldiers four options are useful, well 1 is useful the 'patrol script', say you have 3 soldiers and a single patrol point, at least one soldier will be there if that single spot needs defending. So you can bundle your town opening with your dungeon opening and that one soldier can last until heros or townies or your actual soldiers get off thier fat behinds and leave the dining room to fight or patrol is what it is. What could be added, is a auto level for all characters based on time they have been in your town, or gain experience for all townies, but soldiers gain double. As is the soldier usage can be annoying, i try to make 1/8 to 1/4 townies into soldiers since i play on the hardest difficulty and i do survive most instances of invasion.Point FinalAs was townies die, or the game glitches because some townie is trying to fly off a roof, or climb three spaces high for that first piece of stone or ore and cannot reach, that does now with the last update usually cancel all actions for a townie that cannot reach or interact with a ai-script(farming,mining,building) and does not cause too much of an issue. Unless that townie is behind that 3 story wall just too far to reach the ground, and dies of starvation, scaffolding!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! WTF WHY is there no auto build SCAFFOLDING when something is just out of reach, or why start up the map with stupid stone bricks i need to mine on the surface of the map stacked up like some tower. REcent update added scaffolds decay after time, so no need to delete them unless that immediate space is needed, wait a while and the scaffolding will fade away from the game, its kind of cool getting a 3 story structure up and watching it unfold as teh scaffolding decays away and reveals the time you spent clicking each brick into place, each window painstackingly placed. It makes it worth it too, if like I do often I show off my towns online or to friends i say hey look what i spent four hours making.( I got one friend to buy the game, and after about ten hours of playing he had about 15 townies, i wanted to cry) The game has no introduction, as well as no explanation, examples being bone torch=1 happiness, harp=2 happiness, decorated wall= go ---- yourself(i think to myself) it does not add any worth while happiness as it does override all better happiness objects.EXTRA POINT------------------------------- MAKE ALL WALLS,optional decorated(same look but with makes happiness) and costs say 1 extra material of a single needed of a single variety.Back TO last POINT of interest------------- Play this game only if you understand ai scripts and basic map editor knowledge as once you get the hang of it, its totally easy to play even on the hardest of difficulties, my favorite too because you do not get stupid molerats stealing your food, instead just some ogres to fight.Yes i recommend this game to anyone who has a brain and enjoyings a challenge, it is unfinished, good chance what there is is all there will ever be in this game.So far, I have yet to find a single piece of useful information on the forums and online searches, you need to learn from the game, find the flaws and single them out.My personal example of playEither map type,FIRST ACTION-------------- CREATE 16 resident tiles 3x3 each, wait 30 seconds, you get more townies to start the game with!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!SECOND ACTION----------- Make into soldiers all townies and hunt down all of the monsters on the surface of the map, no not leave a single monster alive. Change all but the best soldier(based on stats, only hp and offense matter) back intotownies(equip the townies who are your lumber workers with the dropped weapons from the monsters. ENJOY a fruitful start to a great town."

It's pretty fun for the money, and you'll get pretty engaged managing your little town. It has a lot of complexity, but not very accessible... be prepared for a little front loading on tutorials. The features are a bit haphazardly put together, but you can still cobble together a pretty good experience out of it.The tragedy here is that the developer quit working on the game before it was completed. In all honesty, I wish Towns had been where it is now when it was put up for early access. Developers calling it quits or settling for ""almost good enough"" is getting pretty tiring in the independant market."

Yeah, there are bugs, the game is unfinished.  At launch, it was one of very few city building sims on Steam that had that element of RTS/Hero management.Banished for the same money is a near-AAA experience, so don't go buying this game unless you own that or Cities: Skylines.  If you are into resource and development sims then Factorio is infinitely a better choice.  There are others, but I'm only naming ones I have a lot of experience with.Towns can be considered an early Java template game, it doesn't stray far from what you usually see in typical browser games, but I love it and that's that.  This game has a much better experience than Towncraft, an abandonware game that is way worse of a consumer-trust relationship.Make sure you educate yourself if you're actually consider spending full price on this game.  There are hundreds of games on Steam that would probably be better suited for that amount.  If you want a unique glimpse into what was one of the ""founders"" of how Steam became the conglomerate of early access/scam gaming, you won't be disappointed.  And hey, once you get past the bugs and logic-defying mechanics, you might even enjoy playing it a little bit.  I sure as hell did, and that was back when this game was front and center in the Steam Drama world."

I've enjoyed learning the game on my own without much research on the Towns Wiki or other websites.  The animations are primitive. but again, not the purpose for the game.

It's alive!Objectively, the reviews below saying ""not recommended"" are correct. The game is really not finished, and given it has an development for many years, and has not seen an update in a while, and the developer statement that he is ""burned out"", I would not expect any more updates.With that said, I still spent an enjoyable month or so playing this game. Coming from Dwarf Fortress and wanting something a little prettier, this game provides a nice twist on the genre, rather than mining you ""dig too deep"" by hiring heroes who explore dungeons.It provides an interesting and detailed tech tree, one of the best workshop designs I have seen in any such game (you place zones for workshops and then crafting stations within zones).That said, I am obsessed with this genre and desperate for other games in it. If you want to try something like this but with active development and far more polished, I highly recommend Gnomoria (and keeping an eye on Stonehearth and Clockwork Empires).I would still recommend this game, although given it is unlikely to see any updates I would personally want to see the price knocked down a little given its incomplete state.I really hope the new developer breathes new life into this game, but I feel like once the game gets into a negative feedback cycle developers have little incentive to do so -- when everyone is panning your game on Steam and no updates have been released for a year and a half, what is your incentive to continue working on it?Even if you decide not to buy, I would keep an eye on this game just in case things change.This game has a tremendous amount of potential, and is farther long than many games in the genre."

I originally bought the game at version 8 (now it's version 14e), so yeah, I'm amongst those who were ""cheated"" by early promises, and I will still give this game a thump up.Why it does deserve the hate? Because it's clearly unfinished.-Several in-game features are clunky, for example ordering your troops around: you can't simply say ""go there"", you can only place patrol points. So exploring the dungeons beneath the surface is like: right-click somewhere, place waypoint, wait until they get there, right-click on waypoint, remove waypoint, right-click somewhere else, place waypoint, wait until they get there, etc. Since there's no other option I can live with it, but I'm not lovin' it.-Poor pathfinding. The townies may just ignore the roads, although they walk parallel with them only one square away.-AI is lacking. The haulers tend to choose stuff to pick up far, far away, instead of that exact same thing they are standing on. And, please, don't go to sleep or eat when several dozens of spiders are besieging the town. Also, don't try to gather loot in the middle of the battlefield, because it's dangerous to your health.-The variety of stuff to build is a bit underwhelming, although not always. For example you can build one type of wooden chair (not counting that one which needs gold besides wood), but at the same time there are like twenty stone wall styles. So building homes is not on Sims level.I think these are the negatives worth mentioning, may update if I encounter something I haven't written here yet. Umm, okay, others may say the music is repetitive, but I don't mind, it's not horrible.Why it does not deserve this much hate:- Contrary to a lot of other reviews, I have not encountered _any_ bugs, at least not apparent ones. No memory leaks. No hangups, no slowdowns, no CTDs. I don't really get what others mean when they describe this game as ""buggy as ****"". There were a lot of them in earlier versions, but right now this is one of the most bug-free games I ever played.I will not make a list about other pros, because they are subjective. I just leave here this: I still prefer Towns way over Gnomoria, and if it was a terrible game I wouldn't have come close to play it for 270 hours. Not many of my games can boast that much playtime.Thus, I dare to say, if you like building towns from blocks, and if Towns is on sale, try it."

Setting up a thriving town in this game is a real uphill battle, with so many things that can go wrong and things that can just tear your barely-surviving town apart. When you get new settlers to arrive at the map borders, it's also a challenge to make sure they can get to town safely. However, the more you fight and the more you work, the stronger your villagers will become, and the better they can survive in the harsh wilderness. It's a real satisfying feeling to beat the odds and set up a thriving community in this game... and then the seiges and the werepigs come in and wreck your day...If you can pick this game up for about $5 or less during a sale or something (or you preferrably have ways to get it for free), I'd say it's worth looking into.

I do wish there was a way to strengthen your heroes more before you send them to the lower levels (other than raids), but at least they don't stop coming. Sure I had to look up some things on the wiki but it was the same way for everybody for games such as this, or Minecraft, or they had a friend who told them the recipes or the way redstone works and ways you can implement redstone to make something awesome. I hope Towns has more updates in the future to fix certain minor things, but other than that I very much enjoy playing the game. Another plus is how simple mods are done, unlike Minecraft I can get most of the mods I want to work (Not to dog on Minecraft because I love Minecraft too, but the mods are done poorly for it) For towns you just have to drop the mod into the mods file, while Minecraft will make you download other mods to get mods to work. Also Towns has (I think) an official mods website that you can go to, while Minecraft you have to trust your instincts on whether to download said mods. I know there's the wiki and stuff for mods, but when I download them and drop them in the mods file it always crashes my game or just doesn't work.

Never played Dwarf Fortress, so I'm one of the few who can't really compare this to that. To me, it's like a mashup of Minecraft and Majesty. There's definitely room for improvement, but the developers are saying this is still technically only an alpha build of the game, so if they don't drag their feet and actually listen to feedback from their community, this game could one day go from being a fun little time waster to a truly great game in it's own right.

You gotta get resources make sure you have food and armor to keep them safe and healthy.Build a hospital if they are injured.Build each of your villagers a home and add decoration to make them happy to allow more villagers to join in.Build a trade market get resources you have hard time getting from the merchant and sell your resources you been gathering for money.build a tavern with tavern room to get heroes to join the village dig below the cave to allow heroes to explore for more rare ores.Build a animal farm so many bones drop? no problem make armor out of them and build your homes bone are useful material in this game.Keep your villagers happy and give each of them a task so they dont over burden their works if you make them work to hard they will die so careful what action you do to give your villages and watch them prosper.

First we must realize a basic concept here... for $15 if you expect developers to work forever on a game, and never stop, you're expecting too much.Beyond that... it's a great game! I've played over 500 hours off and on for years, and is one of the few titles that I will pick up and play over and over again.Buggy: I believe most people are playing minimal time and doing stupid things (like queuing 1000 tasks to 10 townies and wondering why they aren't doing a specific task) then screaming ""buggy buggy!"" Because they can't admit that they suck at the game.Towns is a great game. I have 0 issues with how it is, as is. Perhaps it's because I don't suck, I know how to play the game, and even more importantly, learn how to overcome obstacles instead of cry like a baby to have someone patch and fix a games challenges so that it becomes easy (boring).Pull up your big-boy pants naysayers... Towns for $15... I would have paid $40 and still been happy. To current date (and I'm still playing!) that's $0.03 / hour.Keep in mind - NEVER had 1 crash, never had one broken save of any kind. In 500 hours I've yet to see a ""bug"". It does not frustrate me, and I don't expect more.Towns is a great game to whittle away time, get off your high-horse baby-wagon naysayers and learn to play the game instead of cry broken because you can't manage a toon town."

The difficulty is also very biased.

Let's just say that I no longer find any enjoyment out of this. This is a game with tutorials that are about as easy to understand and Astro Physics, the difficulty curve makes it really hard for newcomers and really annoying for anyone else. In this game you build a town, get people to move in, manage the food, water, ect. Eventually you may even get a warrior to move in. The problem is keeping your people alive, with the management system not quite working, which is a big problem in a game that is all about managing. Here is an example...You set some of you villagers to start picking apples, drop them off, and then cook them into pies. You then get the rest of your crew to go mining, with the help of some warriors. After about 20 seconds the warriors decide to wander off, 2 of the 5 you had get themselves killed, on the way to the apple and pear trees your villagers manage to drown themselves, the rest come up from mining to find no food and then die from starvation on the way to pick apples.The result is a game that doesn't want you to enjoy it too much.

Nowhere on the game's store page does it inform you that development is not finished. I paid the same amount for Minecraft when it was still in beta and it was more complete than this. Terraria equally I bought for $5 and it was a better finished product than this.Avoid this game until they finish it, if they get around to it. Download the free demo from their website if you really want to see if you like it, but I can't honestly say this is worth even the initial sale price of $12 in its buggy, incomplete and VERY alpha state."

When I first bought this game, I was under the impression that work would continue to happen with it and that it would see improvements. But this game is Not finished. Not even close.The number of glitches encountered with some of the most basic game mechanics are just inexcusable for a game that is neither in Alpha, nor Beta.I have a lot of time in this game, and it's gaming time that I've enjoyed. But I would never have bought this product had I known it would never see development again.

,Not Recommended,221020,7500125,"Posted: 27 October, 2013",all,APEX||PREDATOR,"You'll hate yourself for playing this game. You really will. You see, this entire game revolves around using an annoying UI to control villagers with an intensely annoying AI to handle logistics poorly and theoretically command them to eventually get around to doing the things you'd like to do. Sort of like Majesty, if you had to build your buildings from scratch, the only part of them that was technically necessary outside of aesthetics was the floor and your kingdom had a rule of law that all new citizens born in the nation must be dropped on their head.You start out with about 11 morons to shepherd around, gradually kit them out in safety harnesses and protective helmets so that they'll be safe when you shove them out the door and hope that you'll lose as few as possible. Eventually you start getting heroes and such that you can use to explore the dungeons that extend deeper and deeper into the map and who protect your village from the increasingly difficult sieges laid by enemies, which can feel satisfying as hell to watch them fight after getting used to your moron brigade's perpetual failure.This is also one of those games where you open a wiki while you play, just so you know. Otherwise your village will completely and totally fail because the only way to get new villagers depends on the happiness of the village, which is designed in a way that either you intentionally build your village with them in mind, or else you die and start over.I dumped about thirty hours into it over the course of a week, then didn't touch it again afterward. That's pretty much the type of game this is.EDIT: About a year later, coming back to this review I'm changing my review to negative and adjusting the sarcastic-praise slightly. The game is still fun (and from playing it a bit more, the AI is less moronic than I recalled), and the UI is tolerable now that I remember how it works (though it's still not good). That said, you shouldn't buy this game. Buying it supports the developer, and he abandoned it without shame. If you want to play it, by all means do so, just don't give the developer money in order to do that. I'll leave figuring out how to obtain the game without paying the absent dev up to you, but that's my suggestion."

To be fair, the game feels like it still needs a fair bit of spit-and-polish (several menus aren't labeled, you'll need to make multiple references to the wiki to figure out what you're doing) But the game's still early in its life and they're promising they're still working on it, so I have high hopes for it, and I see a fair amount of potential.

One thing for sure it needs upgrades or updates badly. It's not like it feels incomplete but it certainly is not at the point were I think it needs no extra work. They say they plan on updatng it as an ongoing thing. And it sure needs it.  I like the game for what I have played.If it keeps getting updated I am sure it will reach the point were I can suggest it to everyone!

No gamebreaking bugs, or anything along those lines. And it's a fun game to play.I have heard rumors that the game was been ""abandoned"", and is ""unfinished"". But I don't think a game like this needs constant updates anyways, and I don't really feel like it's unfinished. It's not like an RPG game that has a difinitive ending, you can literaly do anything you want. Just look at some of the screenshots!The one thing I had problems with was digging into the ground to open up the Dungeon. Sometimes I just end up making a mess, and it can be hard to block it off (if you don't monsters can come up and attack your town), but other than that, I haven't had any real issues with the game.In the end, if you like building things from scratch or making an arsenal of weapons and armor for the ""Heroes"" to use to clear out the dungeons, then you'll like this game.
