Enjoyed every second completing it.Surprisingly, after almost 2 years passed by, the game still can offer something plus that's worth discovering one more time.Nevertheless there are new functions, abilities, and the game looks better than before.Defo worth trying it if you never heard about it, and defo worth reinstalling and replaying if you already owned it!"
,Recommended,221180,14996394,"Posted: 21 March, 2015",all,jjm319,"This is an enjoyable game.  I would like to mention the cool sci-fi ideas behind this.  THis game is based on an actual proposed technology called dyson trees. THese would be some sort of replicating technology that could colonize asteroids and bud seeds that could go on to colonize others.  It also is related to a type of space probe called a self replicating Von Neumann machine. So you play as sort of an nanotechnology intelligence embodied in these trees/seed. Pretty cool.The game itself is enjoyable, you can play it at a slow speed for a meditative growing game or crank it up to fast making it a little frenetic. I played the original a while ago. Im not sure what all has been upgraded, but it has better graphics, i think more missions and modes, some extra controls. Get this game."

This game weaves together a beautiful living picture as you play, with pleasant and relaxing aesthetics, from sound to visuals.Gameplay7A wonderfully relaxing game, Eufloria is great to sit down and play when you're looking to just chill out. Mesmerizing in style, with a downtone soundtrack, Eufloria offers up a unique take on strategy games. Taking a much more tug of war approach, you grow your seeds (altering their stats via another artful gameplay mechanic) and work to overwhelm the opposing forces. Eventually it becomes a domino effect as you send wave after gigantic wave of units from planet to planet, toppling over the enemy's forces. However, it can be a bit tedious at times waiting for your army to grow enough to make your next move, particularly at the start of each game. This problem is few and far between though, as several times you are under immediate pressure to act.Story3You probably won't find yourself caring much about the story of this game, as it is strange and vague most the time.MultiplayerN/ANone to be found here.Replayability5Eufloria is one of those games you come to when you need it. For me, that particular time is when I need to wind down and relax. Each time coming back is enjoyable though.Overall6/10Don't get confused by the 6 over there, that's still a good number. I definitely recommend Eufloria to anyone that enjoys sitting down and playing a chill game. If you're looking for fast paced action this game is not for you. Eufloria is a moment of calm in a storm of run-and-gun, spray-and-pray, leap-then-look games.If you liked this review, feel free to check out my curator page:The TipsterYou are also welcome to join our group and play/discuss games together, here:The Tipster"
,Recommended,221180,16894911,"Posted: 5 July, 2015",all,Nugget,"Eufloria HD is an upgraded version of the original Eufloria, which I also played.Both games are an extremely relaxing and atmospheric strategy based on some gameplay mechanics from simpler flash strategy titles: capture planets (here called asteroids), upgrade them (here with beautiful trees that grow over time) and they will generate units (here called seedlings) over time, then use said units to flood other asteroids. Take over the map and you win. Rinse and repeat.Despite the fact that the games tend to reach a certain tipping point where it becomes easy to overwhelm your enemies, Eufloria is a very polished take on this idea, and a lot of fun to boot! The soundtrack is very mellow, and the visuals are clean and beautiful.This version upgrades the visuals and adds some new mechanics, such as the ability to upgrade asteroids which have poor stats by sacrificing seedlings, and rallying points which means less needless clicking and dragging.There is a solid story mode that can take about 10 hours to complete (or more depending on what speed you play at), as well as arcade levels and a New Game + mode. Overall, a decent amount of content for the price.Honestly, I cannot recommend this game enough! It has a great, calming atmopshere, some straightforward but satisfying RTS gameplay and a solid campaign and arcade mode. Definitely worth the price!"

Smart, simple, a cool and mysterious story with inspiring sci-fi elements presented in a mythical manner.There are plenty of indie games that look really cool when you see their art and design that you think will be okay, then fall flat on their face with disappointing gameplay. Eufloria does not do that. It is amazingly fun and intuitive after a few minutes, with interesting challenges as you continue that make following the text based mystery even more exciting. It does get challenging, but if you need help, this is one of the only games with in-game hints that are actually super helpful. No random variables thrown in to frustrate you - if you mess up you know it's because you haven't figured out this tactic yet, not because the challenge is arbitrary.I did not know it was a hybrid RTS-Tactical Problem Solver. I just thought it looked pretty. I was very happily surprised that the game was basically exactly what I wanted.Absolutely worth the full price.I got it on the summer steam sale for 3$ - I also got a bunch of others, and so far Eufloria is not only the best of them, but is carrying the banner for how good and indie game can be. And should be."

,Recommended,221180,13080715,"Posted: 25 November, 2014",all,RPINerd,"Eufloria (and it’s HD upgrade) are strategy games at the core, however I’m not sure what sub genre they fall into. Similar to games like Galcon, the goal is to plant your seed on large planets, allow forces to build up, then swarm the next planet to expand. It feels a lot like the combat within an RTS, but simplified down immensely and without any base building aspects.That being said, it’s not a bad game. I first played it on mobile and I think the simplicity of the format works well with a touch screen,  however when making the switch to PC I found that I felt very idle in the game. With a mouse, keyboard and macros I have infinitely more micromanaging power than when I’m toilet gaming with two thumbs. Because of this, I find that this isn’t a very compelling title to own on PC. Eufloria (and Eufloria HD) are good games and I do recommend you give them a go, but be fully aware that you’re going into a more mobile-minded experience."

It's a very low brainpower time waster that you can play while listening to podcasts or audiobooks.I'm not meaning that it is a waste of time, just that even after you've played it before and all the mystery is taken out, the gameplay is still fun, even if you aren't actually seeing anything different or improving your skill at the game.Get yourself a good audiobook and play a few rounds.Actually I kinda wish they had made more of those map packs and extra missions."

For those of you who have played before: The tutorial has been greatly improved, both in pacing and in clarity. The UI is much easier to read at a glance, and much more intuitive to boot. I also greatly appreciate some of the features they've added - beacons, terraforming, etc. It's definitely worthwhile to revisit.If you haven't played before, Eufloria is a unique RTS through and through. It's amazing how this game pairs a relaxing setting with challenging goals.  I get so absorbed I often don't realize how much time has passed. There is a time element, but it's not strict. You can pace yourself however you wish. The game increases in difficulty somewhat slowly, but the hardest levels kept me entertained long after I finished story mode. There's a surprising amount of complexity arising from simple mechanics. The fact of the matter is - I played 50+ hours of the original, and here I am years later, and the mechanics are still feel fresh and challenging. That, my friends, is the mark of a good game."

,Recommended,221180,12598366,"Posted: 21 October, 2014",all,Mr_Twister,"An enjoyable, relaxing RTS game with great atmosphere.  Don't be fooled by my playtime, I played the original Eufloria years ago, and it's still in my Steam top-20 with nearly 50 hours played.  Impressive for a small indie game, especially if you consider I don't generally like RTS games.  And now these wonderful developers decided to gift the new improved HD version to everyone who bought the original game.The game isn't complicated at all, the tutorial levels do a great job to teach you all you need to know.  You start with seedlings around an asteroid under your control.  You can move them to other asteroids within your influence sphere, possibly attacking enemy seedlings in the process, or plant them to grow a tree.  Trees produce seedlings, with increasing output overtime when they become fully grown.  Seedlings come with 3 characteristics, based on the quality of the asteroid they were grown on : energy, strength and speed.  Strength and speed are obvious, higher energy means you will need less seedlings to conquer an enemy asteroid.  Some more complexity later on, but those are the basics in a nutshell.What makes this game great is the atmosphere, sound & graphics.   It really looks gorgeous, with a high attention to detail (e.g. seedlings stats also change the way they look).  You notice how the developers really made this with a passion.  The levels are partially procedurally generated, the level will never be identical, but some parameters stay the same.  The music is nice and relaxing.  You also have a lot of control over the speed of the game, allowing for both rushed gameplay or a relaxing experience.If I have to mention something negative, the only thing I can think of is the lack of complexity.  Levels start to feel too similar after awhile, because you are growing seedlings and invading asteroids over and over again.  There is some variation in each level's initial strategy, but usually it's pretty obvious if you have to grow, attack or flee to beat the level."

If you want a good game, get the original Eufloria!!**NOTE: I have about 57 hours on record for the original game, and i HIGHLY RECOMMEND that version of Eufloria **Key problems with Eufloria HD:- Navigation; they tried to make it easier, but made it actually harder by adding weird buttons and the green pie to limit numbers. For basic functions like sending scouts or all troops you need more clicks than before. You now need for example up to 3 clicks to complete a move, where it used to be just 1 click- Graphics; i did not see much improvement over the original game. The interface is reasonable, but i prefere the more minimalistic interface of the original game. Certainly no difference that validates the buzzword ""HD""- Sound; the soundtrack is not as relaxed as the original game- ""New"" features; hardly worth mentioning (from what i've seen the gameplay is still basically the same with the levels & achievements)"

,Recommended,221180,13937112,"Posted: 10 January, 2015",all,AnFangsEndes,"Eufloria HD is a zen-out RTS. You play as Freeman Dyson.I would say that the game is an embodiment of good simpleness, in many ways. Regarding the gameplay, it isn't unchallenging, but it is straightforward RTS in design; you've got your scouting, expanding, conflict, and some asset improvement—it doesn't try to overcomplicate itself. Its visuals are also quite simple, using a minimalistic style, which evokes images of insects and plants. It has chill electronic ambient music playing throughout play, never trying to do anything too complicated with its sound, and meshing quite well with the game's all around simplicity. It doesn't try to reinvent the Stanford torus, it's just a good simple game.Improvements made in Eufloria HD over Eufloria look like they have either a console or a mobile version responsible for their existence. This isn't a bad thing. While the UI isn't as purely minimalistic as was in the original, it's far more functional, allowing the player much more manual control over their harvests of seedlings; an example would be splitting a large swarm of seedlings, one half to intercept attackers of one of your undefended asteroids, while sending the other half to punish the attackers for leaving their own asteroid open. In the original, your options were to send all, or if you wanted to split forces, you were required exactly as many right-clicks as units you intended to send, or right-hold, and get a number kind of close to what you wanted; neither of which were quick. There are also now options to filter what you want to send where by traits, without delving into 100% micromanagement. In addition to the improved control over large swarms, due to the addition of beacons to direct where newly spawned seedlings go, building those large swarms is now much easier. Altogether, I feel that these are substantial improvements to the flow of gameplay, removing a large amount of frustration and tedium that wore the zen thin.While I loved the originals, both Dyson and Eufloria, for what they were, Eufloria HD has finally resolved its prior versions' major gameplay flaws, which worked counter to the chill environment its developers envisioned. With that in mind, I can now give the game my wholehearted recommendation for anyone looking for a nice little RTS to relax with. Even if you find its full price a bit of an ask, there are much worse things you could put in your cart during a sale.I should note, that due to the simple monochrome backgrounds with bright neon seedlings, the game lends itself quite well to the Tetris effect."

Eufloria sports a couple of ""super units"" each with their own special abilities, two types of ""base structures"" and a simple upgrade system which adds depth to an deceptively complex strategy game. Not many hours of first-play-through time, but at its standard low price its quite enjoyable.

Gameplay mechanics are simple, yet the gameplay itself can be very challenging.  It's beautiful, it's either slow or fast paced depending on your modd, the music and sounds are just the right amount and volumes...  For a relaxing, simple RTS experience, there is no other game I can think of I'd rather play.While I personally prefer the ""thinner"" aesthetic of the original Eufloria, a couple of hte new mechanics in Eufloria HD make it far less of a pain at times to send various commands and deal with overall gameplay.

I enjoy this sort of game though I'm sure it's not for everyone - try the demo first if you're concerned. The updated HD version is a little bit different in the mechanics but I've already gotten used to it and I think it's for the best.My work requires that I be rather creative and that can be a big mental drain sometimes. This game has been a great way for me to wind down after a long day. There's still plenty of thinking involved but the ambient sounds/music makes a relaxing atmostphere even when my minions are getting slaughtered. I also appreciate the fact that the game doesn't really force me to be something I'm not - there are some levels where speed or sneakiness wins the day but typically, you play the strategy you like best and as long as you play well, you'll win.The storyline is fairly simple, just enough to carry you from mission to mission, teaching you different strategies. I kind of wish more games taught this way in their campaign modes. Maybe to some it seems like hand-holding, though. Regardless, I appreciate not having to think so hard in a game while still feeling engaged.The downsides: not much. It is what it is - an 'ambient strategy game'. Sometimes the really big missions get a bit boring when you have to wait for enough seedlings to accumulate in order to make a key move. The new speed change option in the HD version pretty much fixes that issue for me, however. But still no co-op. I think they're could be great potential there... maybe in Eufloria 2 or something?"

That’s always appreciated.It’s a semi-relaxing puzzle/RTS game where you have various planet-like structures, surrounded by your seedlings. These seedlings can move to different planets and turn into trees, which are used to make more seedlings or to work as defences. The idea of most levels is to have as many seedlings as possible and attack other planets to take over the sector. It is constantly introducing new game mechanics, so it’s always interesting. The levels sometimes have different objectives (get to here, protect this planet, rescue these seedlings, etc) to provide variety.It’s also pretty awesome for playing whilst watching something (TV, YouTube, etc).

For example, one of the maps, Hide and Seek, intended for you to abandon your previous planets and move onto the enemy's stronger planets. In HD, they added a feature to strengthen your planets by sacrificing soldiers, so you can simply farm seedlings on a throwaway planet and bolster a crappy planet's stats until it can take on a giant, taking away from the level's original goals.The fast forward feature is a blessing in HD, and it'll be hard to go back to the original for this reason alone.

Supposedly relaxing but can be quite hectic on some levels.There is one major flaw in this game - one of the achievements is impossible.  The ""Hero"" achievement is broken.  Level 12 is supposed to have 100 seedlings you can find/rescue on the map (on top of your starting 100).  There are only 60.  The devs acknowledged this issue and promised a fix several years ago.  It has not eventuated.As I am an achievement hunter, this ruins the game for me completely.Game is 9.5 out of 10 for me for just the game but, due to the broken achievement which makes it impossible to get a perfect completion in Steam, I cannot recommend this game to anybody with any level of achievement OCD.EDIT:  I found that there are LUA files for each level.  I modified the LUA file for level 12 so that it no longer has only 60 seedlings to rescue.  This allowed me to complete the ""Hero"" achievement for the game.  Note that, even with that adjustment, there are actually too few seedlings to rescue to make the achievement possible (adding the extra 40 was not enough) so adjust the numbers accordingly and the achievement will unlock.

Seedlings have stats depends on which asteroid they were grown on, and as a result are faster, stronger or hit harder than other spawns.To expand your asteroid empire, you plant offensive or defensive trees, resulting in a SAMsite tree or a spawner tree. Later on you end up having randomly spawning flowers which can buff your trees to grow a laser mine or turn your seedlings into steroid mosquitos.The campaign usually has a little twist, though it eventually comes down to the same, mass a big army of strong death needles by expanding your asteroids you hold and steamrolling the rest. There are a few missions with a twist though, like a hide and seek one (though the AI doesn't play by the challenge's rules at times and ruins your day, play on the relaxed mode for a fairer fight on that one).I can recommend it provided not playing it too much consecutively, then you do feel your'e just doing the same over and over.Enjoy it for its relatively calm gameplay, and steroid mosquito simulation."
