,Recommended,221260,8486965,"Posted: 1 January, 2014",all,RadiantChaos,"Little Inferno is one strange beast of a game. Upon startup, the game immediately presents nothing but a fireplace, and tasks players with simply burning the few letters they have with them. Immediately afterward, a catalog is sent, and the rest of the game is spent purchasing items and setting them aflame, watching the strange animations each item has. My first reaction, upon realizing what the game had in store for me, was ""They made a whole game out of this?""The humorous thing about this game, though, is that it WANTS you to feel that way. In fact, it encourages it by making you wait long, painful periods of time - upwards of a couple minutes - for your new kindling to arrive. And yet, for whatever reason, I found myself enjoying the experience. It was strangely appealing, setting things ablaze, and I wanted to see what would come of my neighbor, who continuously sent me letters. So I kept playing for 3 hours straight.In the end, the game throws a massive twist on you. I don't want to spoil too much, but let's just say that I was completely thrown for a loop and felt like quite a fool for having spent such a long time playing the game. This isn't a criticism to Little Inferno; rather, this is the highest praise the game could achieve, because it is exactly what the developers sought to accomplish.A couple of days after playing Little Inferno, I can't help but reflect on it fondly and reminisce. A remarkable work of satire, I truly believe this game will be remembered for all time as one of the most humorously self-aware experiences this medium has ever created. Well done, Tomorrow Corp."

,Recommended,221260,15733111,"Posted: 7 May, 2015",all,Dr. Frog ☭☢,"Fireplace simulator 2013 is more than just a sandbox game. The base storyline is in a world full of what seem to be orphans, the planet is getting colder, and to keep warm the “Tomorrow Corporation” (Also the name of the developers) make an entertainment fireplace for all the boys and girls. The story continues as you play more into the game.The base gameplay is clicking to create fire, and buying this from a catalogue to burn them. Unfortunately, you have to wait real time in order for the toys or electronics or whatever to arrive. This mechanic in the game is a massive downside, because some items in the later catalogues take a full 2 minutes. I see that the Dev’s wanted to make the game last longer but it's an annoying amount of time. Not long enough to alt tab and do something else, but long enough for the player to be annoyed. This time can be finished but using stamps, which can be collected by burning certain combos of objects. The list and what items required are online so this can be figured out easily. The gold coins you use to buy the objects to burn, are earned by, you guessed it, burning things. Its almost impossible to go broke in this game, with profiting from burning most things, and random spiders coming down and providing $ from their burnt corpses.Burning combos, at first, seem to be the only objective. After a little bit of time someone in the next room sends you a letter, befriending you. Her and “The weatherman” start to produce a legitimate storyline, making the game more appealing, drawing the player to play more. After grinding out the combos the player is handed a combo that is very easy to do, implying said player has a good memory. After that combo is completed a whole new world and story is added to the mix. The story is added in gradually but soon becomes the full focus. Its not only a well told story, but it's also a grasping one.The graphics of the game fit the game alright, but the music in-game make the world around you feel so much darker and lonely, suiting the game perfectly.Little inferno does some things right.The sound and music is amazingThe story is one of the best i have ever seen out of an indie gameThe combos, are witty and require some thinking, making it more immersiveThe fireplace looks good, and get to annoying to look atThe objects you burn are rather comicalThe ability to toss burning objects around your fireplace is good fun.Little inferno does some things wrong too.The lack of achievements and playing cards make the game a time killer, lowering their audienceThe story although great, is slow to get started.The repetitive nature could leave some players bored after an hour or twoThe combos are both hard and easy at the same time, depending on the player’s skillThe combos are really easy to look up shortening the game time and lowering the funLittle inferno, although a compelling story and a good time killer, isn't really worth the $10.99(CAD). With the lack of achievements and playing cards, it seems almost like a narrative interactive book, then a game. The price aside, i think people who love a great story, or even just wanting a few hours to go buy, should pick up this game. If it's ever on sale, get it. This is the weatherman, signing off. We’re all going to be okay."

,Recommended,221260,32742696,Posted: 24 June,all,ThatsSoSketchy,"Pros:- Very nice to look at- Soundtrack is quite enjoyable and calming- Game has different combinations you can burn to unlock the next catalog and earn ""stamps."" These combinations help immensely with keeping a player interested.- The story and the originality of this game really managed to draw me in from the beginning.- The plot holds a pretty interesting metaphor.- Almost all of the items burn in some special way or do something interesting when they are burned, which also makes the game that much more entertaining.Cons:- Gameplay is definitely quite repetitive after a while; All you do is burn things. The combinations DO help to make this more entertaining, but really only up to a point.- Without giving too much away, I found the ending to be a little unsatisfying. I don't regret playing it to the end, however, I was just expecting a little more.- Very little replay value. I finished 52 out of the 99 combinations before I completed the story, and I might eventually go back and do the rest of the combinations for the fun of it, but beyond that I don't expect to ever to this game again.- The ""wait times"" for some of the objects feel just a little unnecessary; I didn't mind the 30 second or 1 minute timers, but some of them took nearly 3 minutes. At that point it felt almost like the developers were just trying to extend the gameplay time but it ended up making for some dull moments.Overall, I found Little Inferno to be quite relaxing and, for the most part, entertaining. The gameplay was eventually quite repetitive, but not to the point of me losing interest. The short story was quite pleasant and although I personally didn't find the ending as satisfying as it could've been, I did enjoy the overall message the game conveys (which is left up to the player to figure out and interpret). I do plan on going back and finishing the different combos just for the sake of being a completionist, but after that I don't expect to play this game again.I would not recommend buying this game at full price, but if you can catch it on sale (like it is now), I would definitely recommend it."

For many small games, there is a point where, for the sake of keeping up with the challenges the gameplay introduces, the player's mind effectively strips away the colorful facade of it, revealing the core mechanics to be yet another twist on an ages old arcade, which it is perceived as from there on. Here, that's hardly the case.Then again, the complexity of Little Inferno's gameplay is somewhere between that of Clicker Heroes and a bubble wrap simulator. Yet, given how deeply satisfying the look and feel of this trivial process proves, and how the occasional story shards keep popping up at just the right moments, this simplicity manages to give birth to some mesmerizing immersion.The visuals are freakishly grotesque and disarmingly adorable at the same time, and the beautiful soundtrack contributes overwhelming emotionality to the process. Invest in it just a bit, click away the build-up, and you find yourself at the story's climax, gasping for every little final detail like a revelation.Little Inferno is a cozy place to be. The flames will consume you whole. But that's okay."

You have a catalogue of toys to order from and you burn those toys. But you're not just burning will-nilly, there are little word puzzles to solve. For example, for the clue ""movie night"" you burn a cob of corn (which turns into popcorn) and a television. The puzzles have themes, I enjoyed the one based on recent indie games a lot. As you're burning things and solving these puzzles you get mail from the makers of Little Inferno and your neighbour who is also burning everything in sight.Between the game's dark sense of humour and the joy of watching everything burn, this is a game I fully recommend."

The art and the music; because I'm a very emotional person and I find that those are the two aspects that really get me into a game.Little Inferno BLOWS it ALL out of the water.The art is just phenominal. It's smooth, unique, and makes me feel very comfortable. I'm not sure how that will relate to anyone else, but everything just feels so smooth. Each item has its own personality. The game controls and mechanics are very comfortable, very natural. You left click to drag and drop. Very simple. The graphics are unique and the goals are challenging as hell! You really, REALLY have to think very hard when it comes to some of the goals within the game.The music is SO very emotional... I think the music is a good 70% of the game. The dialogue is 20% and the rest is the gameplay itself. I've downloaded the music for my own personal collection because I love it so much. It is definitely someting that helped drive me through the game.The game is simple, try to match up the combos. But pay attention to the story line that SHE gave you.

I've read that some people were disappointed, claiming that the game felt like it was missing something or lacking, but it's all in the eye of the beholder. I was perfectly pleased and fell in love with it. There's not a lot of challenge to it, if any, but there is a lot of beauty and discovery and fun for the curious who like to experiment. This is not a game for the people who crave constant action or stimulation. If anything, Little Inferno will soothe and calm you. There's something very relaxing about watching the objects burn, and the atmosphere has a very ambient feel despite wondering about the sinister intentions behind your Little Inferno Fireplace that was given to you by a big company, Tomorrow Corporation, that you know very little about. But the premise is that the world around you is freezing, and you have to keep burning things to stay warm and farther more, although it's unspoken, most likely to stay alive.This game is often described as a ""Fireplace simulator,"" but there's a little more to it than that. It has a plot with a few surprises with a twist that left me surprised and emotional. On top of that, watching things burn never grow tiring. In fact, they often burn with pizzazz. There are a lot of unexpected outcomes, from sounds, to special effects, to beautifully colored flames. You'll be excited to burn the next thing to see how it reacts."

Just like World of Goo, the developers have taken amazingly addictive gameplay in which you throw toys and expired food into a fireplace and burn them to get money and stamps to order more; and threaded an intriguing story into it, almost imperceptibly.

,Recommended,221260,925536,"Posted: 17 March, 2013",all,7grain,"To paraphrase Hyperbole and a Half: ""Burn ALL the things!""Little Inferno is a curious way to waste a few hours. You have a fireplace. You order toys and other objects from catalogs not to play with, but to burn. Sometimes, the mailman brings letters from the neighbors. You'll burn those, too.It's a little bit creepy and, yes, entertaining. Is there more to this game? Yes. No. Both, I think.Fans of Kyle Gabler's earlier work, ""World of Goo"", will recognize a similar smug poke at the things we take for granted in this always-online age, but I don't mean to suggest that there is somehow more of a game here than ""burning stuff."" Suffice to say that there are varying levels of interaction going on with the things you burn. I don't think that's a spoiler. It's game enough that there is a beginning, a middle, and an end.However, the artistic style and soundtrack are the true star of this game. My daughter walked in on me playing, and within 10 seconds she asked ""Is that a new game from World of Goo?"" Gabler's artwork and music are immediately recognizable.Just as in ""World of Goo"", the art of Little Inferno defines a warm and unsettling world, where a fun game with simple mechanics is just the exposed surface of a much larger world gone awry. Or... not! These games can be played by a 5-year-old, but jaded adults will naturally seek deeper meaning."

The nonsensical, comical game style makes the game highly enjoyable and addictive. The objective of the game is to burn various items in your fireplace in return for coins, with which you buy more items to burn! When you burn certain items together you will unlock combos, these give you extra coins and when you get ebough you are able to purchase a new catalogue containing new items to burn!When put like that the game does not sound very enjoyable, however the way in which the items react just makes you want to see more of the game.Tomorrow Corp also add in another couple of characters who you get to meet and develope relationships with as the game progresses including an annoying but lovable neighbour who circums to a tregedy later on in the game.The game play is very responsive and you do not need a good computer to run the game. The colourful design gives the game a very positive atmosphere, which seems to be uncommon in newer games.The only down critisism that I have for this game is that it does not take a long time to complete, if you do not focus on unlocking all of the combos you could complete the game in little over 2 hours. But, if you wish to piece together all of the clues than you would have to spend a lot more time on the game.To conclude:Little Inferno if a brilliant and unique game, it includes a lot of fun puzzles to solve and will keep someone entertained for a number of hours. It's relaxed game style means you are able to play it without having to stay and ""finish this bit"" as it saves the game as you go.Graphics: 8/10 Fun but still detailed and high qualityFun: 9/10  You can spend alot of time on this simple game and not get boredOveral: 6.5/10 Superb game but it is a little short for my liking.I would recommend this game to all people, exept children who are easily distressed/upset."

,Recommended,221260,8815473,"Posted: 22 January, 2014",all,Sasquash,"In Little Inferno, you sit in front of a fireplace and burn everything. It is absolutely brilliant. Before the brilliance, however, a few words of warning to the wary buyer. There's a fair amount of waiting in the game, and the puzzles you complete to progress are by no means difficult. If this does not trouble you at all, then stop reading this review right now and buy the game.For those who remain, I present some positives. Little Inferno isn't the most technologically advanced software ever, but it looks very pretty. The bright fire effects and ""JUST BURN EVERYTHING"" gameplay will satisfy your inner child and pyromaniac alike. The things you're burning are quite entertaining in themselves. The game gives each a humorous name and description, and each reacts to being set on fire in a different way. An alarm clock rings until its untimely demise, a model bank churns out money, and firecrackers do exactly what you think they'd do.So, LIttle Inferno is a solid fireplace simulator. But is that it? Is it worth $10? Go watch the trailer, and think about it. There is most definitely something more. As you start up the game, Kyle Gabler's incredible soundtrack dares you to say otherwise. And that is exactly everything I can say about that without ruining it.tl;drLittle Inferno is great. There's fires, and a bunch of other really great stuff that you need to play to find out for yourself, so go buy it. Also, the soundtrack is amazing."

Then the game wants you to find combos to progress and it turns into a Tim Burton-shaped grind, ruining whatever momentum it built up.

Some of the combinations are well thought out and even the ones that aren't are fun to look for. If you like watching things explode and absurd imagery you'll like this game. The ending is sweet and satisfying and the game play is fun even though it's extremely simple in concept. Partially this is due to the art direction being very consistent throughout the game. I had a lot more fun playing this game with a friend or two in the room coming up with silly combinations to burn with me.The game benefits from knowing just how weird its premise is and running with it.Unfortunately once you've gotten all the combinations it doesn't have a lot of replay value as the story is linear and there are a set number of specialized interactions. But it takes awhile to get all those combinations and it's more than worth it for that first play through.It also runs on well on even low powered machines.

The fire physics are fun to play with, and this game is guaranteed to make the pyromaniac inside you cackle with glee as you burn stuff. Some items are fun just to play with instead of just burn right away (Manly Razer comes to mind). A lot of the things react in unique ways when burned, others... do nothing at all. But if you ever wanted to burn an opera lady or a pirate or... well, this is the place to do it. In that regard, Little Inferno is fun. Some people will say that's enough. It's made more appealing by the story that goes along with it, told through the letters you receive from three different people. While I kinda like the story itself, some of the themes lose their impact due to their overly repetitive nature. I invite you to take a shot every time someone mentions something not lasting forever or never being able to go back.Another thing I don't really understand is why after buying something, you have to wait for it to ship to you. Some items take a few seconds, others take a couple minutes (I believe the longest you'll wait for an item is five minutes). So if you run out of stuff to burn and are waiting for your next batch to arrive, the gameplay grinds to a halt, leaving you sitting there like a putz while you wait for your stuff. If you happen to get some Tomorrow Bucks, you can use those to skip the shipping time, but the game is very stingy about handing them out. The best way to get more is by finding combos, which is also required to unlock the other catalogs. Oh, and did I mention after buying something, not only does it take a while for it to ship to you, but it takes even longer to restock?So to some degree, it feels like I'm playing a free to play game where if I don't have or don't want to spend money (or Tomorrow Bucks in this case), I have to wait to keep playing. I'm not convinced that's a good choice of gameplay mechanic. At least it isn't riddled with microtransactions like free to play games.I wouldn't say Little Inferno is bad, but my biggest gripe is the waiting system; it's just an unnecessary feature that gets in the way of what's otherwise a fun little experience. You'll have an enjoyable time when you're not waiting for more things to burn. I think the story is the strongest point of the game, even though themes are repeated to the point of losing most of their impact.You're more than likely to play this game, finish the story, maybe mess around with burning stuff for a little while, and then get bored and uninstall it. Worth checking out, but I suggest you wait for a sale; this fun toy of a game isn't worth full price."

But should you do the same? I'm not sure.This is definitely one of those ""love it or hate it"" games (if it can even be called a game). I personally loved it, but I wonder how many others will. On one hand, the gameplay consists of burning things... lots and lots of things. This is an act of primal enjoyment for most human beings. But on the other hand, that's really all there is to it (for the most part). I mean that literally - the entire 4+ hour game consists of burning things in a fireplace. I know that sounds boring, but it's actually kind of not. It's fun to throw different items in to see what they do, and finding combinations of items that, when burned together, reward you with tons of cash and more items. How much mileage others will get out of that experience I can't even being to predict.Aside from burning things, the only other notable aspect of the game is its story (which for 90% of the time takes place more in the background). The end of the game changes this significantly, but I shan't say more about that ;). The story is a sort of societal commentary built of mounds of metaphors (some subtle, some not so much), with a major revelation at the end... basically, it's the kind of thing that goes over well with the ""artsy"" crowd. I dug it, but again, I'm just not sure how that translates to a mainstream audience. It does, however, lend itself perfectly to the overall atmosphere of the experience (along with the unique art style and music).If you're open to unique indie experiences and don't mind the $15 price tag, go for it. Just be warned that there's not all that much to it. World of Goo, this most definitely is not - but it's definitely something very unique (in its own very, very weird and addicting way), and all-in-all, a worthy successor."

,Recommended,221260,811582,"Posted: 8 December, 2012",all,mark | dj.,"Little Inferno looks like a simple, casual game, but it's actually a little deeper than that. Yes, you get to throw stuff into a fireplace. A lot of things, in fact. But way, way into the center of it all there's also a storyline to be found. I won't spoil it so I'll just talk about the gameplay a little bit more. While burning things you'll earn coins and stamps. You see, all items have to be ordered and the stamps will give you the ability to instantly deliver an item to your doorstep. Coins can, of course, be used to buy items or increase the number of objects you can stock.A few hours into the game these items will dramatically increase in price.Now, the real goal is to find and create combos. Combining certain items will unlock an achievement and earn you lots of money. And what for ? To buy new items, you got it ! These combos are a must if you want to complete the game, by the way.Most gamers should be able to finish it in 3,5 hours or so. So it's not all that long, and the time limit for deliveries artificially lengthens the game as well, which is a real shame.The graphics and animations are cute and beautiful. And the fire looks quite amazing, with all the ashes and whatnot. Impressive stuff if you ask me.The music is minimal, but memorable. Especially the Weather Balloon song got my attention.All in all it's a fun game but I wish it was even deeper than this. It's still a bit too shallow for my taste.[Rating: 78/100]"

There's no need to rush it, just have a nice chill out session by the virtual fireplace and let things happen as they may.For those that want to enjoy the more ""gamey' aspects, there are 100 combinations of items in all to figure out, and the clues are generally presented well enough that massive bouts of trial and error won't be too necessary.

Luckily, you can skip those if you have some cards you obtain from finding combos, or sometimes at random. You have an infinite supply of money. This is because the items you burn drop MAGICAL golden coins, more than you bought the item with. There's a deep message I won't spoil, but pay attention to the story well. The lighting is beautiful and fairy-tale like. The objects you can burn often have special effects. (Such as popcorn) The only downside I see to this is that people might get bored of the repetetive gameplay, which is kinda part of the game.

I was shocked to see how well the fire mechanics work and some of the items are really fun to burn or burn together. The burning alone is good for a few hours of fun.The combos are basically the only gameplay. There is no conflict. All you do is gather coins to buy things to burn. Burning 2 or more of certain items at the same time scores a combo which gets you express tickets to get items you buy delivered faster. A certain number of combos are required to unlock new catalogs full of new things to burn. There is a combo list you can reference that gives you hints on items to experiment with.There is a small story wrapped up in the game that reveals itself to you over time. The game also has a pretty decent (if long) ending cutscene/activity to reward you for your efforts.Also, if you are given a coupon for a ""Free Hug"", you might not want to burn it. Just a hint. It won't break the game if you do though."

It's not quite a puzzle game, not quite an action game, not quite a sandox game, not quite a simulation game. However, it manages to keep my attention for a good amount of time, and the art is very attractive.Little Inferno offers this subtle-but-not-quite-subtle insight on society. It reminds me of the Ray Bradbury novel ""Fahrenheit 451"" in which books are burned and TV is watched all day. Little Inferno and ""Fahrenheit 451"" both share a satirical undertone exploiting and mocking society.Another thing I like about Little Inferno is just how satisfying the entire game is. I never thought playing with fire could be so much fun!

The most interesting aspect of this game is poperly the story, which you can analyze (or in some cases overanalyze) to have a really deep meaning, but I will get back to that.The gamepaly is really simple you have to burn stuff. And that`s the game, you do nothing more than burning stuff, and it sounds really boring but the game has a fun way, to twist this, so it becomes fun to play.Throughout the game, you will unlock more and more stuff to burn, and all the items have some unic way of burning away, this gives some fun events and senarios, which is enjorable in every way.The other part of the game, is finding combinations. To make the combinations you have to burn specifick things together, in order to unlock the secret. Normally you only get one sentence to geuse, what the combination is, and it is really fun to try to solve the code.Now to the story, the story centers around you, that have got the ""Little Inferno intertaining fireplace"" which is a toy for children in the games world. You are intreduced to four charecters in the game, and then there is the main charecter, which we get no relation to. We get to know miss Nancy, the creator of the Little Inferno, The weather man, who tells you the weather report, your upstairs neighbor Sugar Plumps, who tells you secrests and gives you tasks, and then there is the mailman, who we only meet towards the end. There are two more charecters in the game, but they are not as important for the story as the before mentiont.The analyzing part of this game, is that the fireplace could be a metaphor for gaming.Everytime the fireplace is mentiont the charecters keep taliknig about how you are just wasting time playing the game, not even in a bad way, but more in a revelatory way, where you can think about what you are doing. Sugar Plumps is also good to back of this theory, since she is talking about you two are so close, and yet so far, in relation to the fact that you are palying games together, but in the very end, you are only two screens looking at eachother, insteed of meeting in real life.If you would like a game, where you burn stuff in order to get money to burn more stuff, this is the game for you.If you are a person that like a simple stoyline you easily can interpretent on, this is a game for you.If you like to solve puzzeles, and get rewards in games, this is a game for you.I give this game a thumps up. 7 out of 10"

It is a short game, as I beat it in about 4 hours, but it does have a high replay value, due to the 99 combos you can get, and just the overall stress releaving attitude of the game.  I would say get this if you are into simple games, cause this game will have you craving the aspect of setting things on fire to release you of your pent up stress."

At first its like yay! Who are these people writing to me? Woo! I get to play with fire! and you spend your time methodically setting the acheivement list alight one combo at a time, sending things to Sugar Plumps and listening to the weather reports.Until you start to think... I'm burning my toys. Why?Why is it so cold? Why is there no sun?And the game takes a depressing sort of turn as something happens to your neighbour and then all of a sudden you too find yourself cast out and upon seeing the world outside you realise things about yourself and the state of your own reality that will honestly make you cry. This game is a briliant sneaking satirical look at casting off the things of our childhood and that which distracts us and makes us realise that there is more to life than what we've been doing all this time. Dreams can come true when we stop getting distracted and try that little bit harder.I'd recomend playing this game simply because of the feels it invokes as you play and I would congratulate the devs on such a thoughtful couple of hours that honestly could change a life."

Are you having fun? No? Are you bored of the internet? Cat pictures and♥♥♥♥♥♥not enough for you? All these electronics all over the place just white noise getting in the way of your fun? I have an idea!BURN IT ALL. EVERYTHING. HA HA HA. IT'LL BE TONS OF FUN. AND IT'LL KEEP YOU ALL NICE AND TOASTY-WARM. DO IT. BURN ALL OF YOUR TOYS. BURN IT ALL.Oh? You can't? Well, why the ♥♥♥♥ not? It's easy, come on, anyone can do it. Here, I'll even get you started. Here's your own little personal, nonstop, high-definition, entertainment fireplace. Little Inferno! (Uproarious screams of feral children)Little Inferno is the latest indie masterpiece from the geniuses behind World of Goo, over at Tomorrow Corporation. Originally a launch title for the Wii U's eShop, Little Inferno also found a nice home on PC and Mobile.Like its predecessor, Little Inferno is incredibly unique. The art style is noticeably distinct, with a strong Tim Burton vibe. And that style seems to leak into every other aspect of the game in all of the best ways. Your only purpose in the game is to burn everything. Burn it all. Let it all burn. If that doesn't sound like fun to you, why, you may as well be at the bottom of the ocean.Little Inferno will start you off with the meager instruction manual of the fireplace itself, which will burn pretty quick. But everything you burn will fade to dust, and from that dust will pop magical coins. Coins of a material far more valuable than gold, or silver. They're coins of love. Or maybe chocolate, but those would melt close to the fire.Once you've gotten that far, the entirety of the game opens up to you. You'll be able to purchase a fine selection of perfectly burnable items from one of the many catalogs. Each one brings with it its own unique properties. If you burn batteries, they explode. If you burn wood or paper, it burns very bright and quick. And if you burn living things, why they let out the most delightful scream. But it's not until you've started combining things that the action really starts to heat up. Ba-dum-tss.Little Inferno is a special game in that it's not one with concrete goals. There are no missions to complete, or collectibles to find. It's a simple game with a simple goal. Burning things. It's not quite a puzzle game, or a physics game, or a sandbox game. But it definitely features elements of all three.Trivial ""combo"" challenges work as one of the little things to keep you busy, tasking you with solving little pun riddles by burning specific items together. For example, the ""Springtime"" combo requiring you to set fire to a pack of flower seeds and an alarm clock. Which explodes into a fun little mess of flowers and mechanical bits. Aside from that, the only real ""goals"" to the game are burning every object at least once.But Little Inferno isn't one of those kinds of games. Little Inferno is about more that that. It's about bigger things. Simply burning everything, yeah, that's pretty fun. But the game's surprisingly strong story leaves the biggest impact. And it's done in such a subtle way. In addition to the many flammable objects that you'll be getting in your little mailbox, you'll get occasional letters from your neighbor and other characters. While at first innocent, charming, and mildly creepy, they'll slowly start to clue you in to a much bigger, much more chilling goings-on happening away from your fireplace.It's not a very long game. Unless you attempt to solve every challenge, you should be done with it in hours. It's a lot like like lighting your house on fire. It goes out super fast unless you pour gasoline on it. Trust me. You wouldn't even need to call any firefighters or anything. If you're looking for the kind of game that you can sink tons of time into doing things that might seem ""productive"", this game is not it. But the developers clearly put a lot of love into every little object. Each one is unique in quite a few ways. Some of them have multiple pieces, or react to fire in fun ways. And some have properties that can interact with other objects. You can light a cat on fire and have it explode, filling your entire fireplace with cat poop. And then drop a nuke inside. What kind of sick person would NOT jump at the opportunity to nuke a fireplace full of cat poop?Once you've burned through the game, Little Inferno's haunting and chilling feel will live on in your mind for quite a while. Everything from the zany pyromaniac action to the beautiful use of sound and music, and quirky art direction will leave an impression on you. It's definitely the kind of game that sticks with you for a while after. Burning inside you. Ba-dum-tss.It's the most fun you can have that isn't lighting actual things on fire. And once you've finished playing it, you can just burn the game too. Burn your computer, your game systems, your phones, just burn everything. It'll be tons of fun.Always remember, kids. If you're not the one setting things on fire, you're just the kindling."

Expanding a little on that, the idea is that you burn stuff you buy from the games store in combinations which lets you get access to another level of things to burn. And you don't have to worry about running out of in game money to buy stuff from the store as everything you burn gives you money !Some of the stuff you can burn in your little inferno are really fun, some of the stand outs for me are the mini planets, the cold heart, the nuke, the chainsaw and the valkyrie woman among others.My one gripe is there are no options, running at 1000fps isn't really nessesary so a v-sync option would be nice. And the worst for me is no volume control, the inferno itself is rather quiet as you'd expect from a fireplace but when you go to the store to buy supplies the store music is too loud and repetetive this annoys everyone in my house, myself included!Those are just small complaints though, the game has a humerous and endearing story, fun gameplay and doesn't seem to have any technical faults unlike many other games being sold these days, beware though that for me it only lasted 7.5 hours until completion (I did have to cheat a bit looking up combo's to burn though)."

I loved the ending.Cons:- Some of the item combos were VERY difficult to figure out. I had to cheat and look them up a few times. After seeing what they were, I still couldn't see how anyone could have figured them out on their own.- It's a fairly short game.I had a lot of fun playing Little Inferno.

It’s a nice little loop. It has a similar art style to that of World of Goo and features some really fun little animations that are tailors to the different items you can use.Top Tip #001Make sure to burn at least one of each item in the catalog. We’ve been doing this as we unlock another one because it makes it easier in the long run plus you get to see all the little fun animations as different things burn up. The second reason for doing this is you’ll find out which items like to explode on their own and which need a little extra to get them started.Upgrades and ProgressionThere are various ways in this game to progress and upgrade. One of the many ways is using the money you’ve earned in the form of buying new catalogs and extra spaces in your mailbox. The game keeps you aiming for it’s tasks so you’ll have to keep on top of all them combos too if you wanna keep unlocking new stuff.Top Tip #002Running low on money after making some bad combos? Track down them pesky spiders as they give you 3 corns and after collecting a couple of them you’ll be back to no good burning things again.Speed UpUsing the ‘Tomorrow Stamps’ you can speed up your purchases but we wouldn’t advise this certainly in the early stages of the game because it’s got a good progression speed that keeps in fun and entertaining even whilst you wait for your extra items. We were able to complete the game without using any of these at all so if you are willing to put in the time then try and match us on that.Top Tip #003The max money you can hold is 999 and the max ‘Tomorrow Stamps’ you can hold is 99, any more you collect after that won’t count so if your coming close why not take a minute from completing objectives and just burn some of your favourite in-game items.Mail TasksAs well as completing combos you also have to buy items for the odd little people that like to send you letters.Our favourite in-game itemsWe didn’t want to spoil the game too much so we’ve picked our favourites from the early sets of items you get, but later on there are some really entertaining onesMini Nuke– This sure packs a punch with a huge explosion.Mini Moon– This item has its own gravity similar to the moon and allows you to float all your items in mid airPublished Blog Post"

To literally describe this game, it sounds like abject♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ You get money, you buy things, you burn things, and by burning things, you get money. Where's the hook? Well, there's a very, very subtle storyline, much of which I feel the player has to decide for themselves. A subtle, dark malaise, which hides in the shadows of the gameplay experience. The above description is accurate, all you're going to do is burn stuff over and over, and even if I tell you that different things burn differently and some explode or give random effects, the real hook of this game is that as you do, you're very slowly given hints as to some tragedy in the background. To me, that's almost more compelling than the pure gameplay itself.

,Recommended,221260,12284688,"Posted: 28 September, 2014",all,🌺🌸Futome🌸🌺,"A good game that's about watching high-definition pixels burning all the things while being very amusing and relaxing.Little Inferno is a causal, relaxing game with a underlying message behind the gameplay and the story that's told through mail you get periodically every now and again when you buy the next tier of items to set ablaze in your Little Inferno Playset.Before I explain the gameplay, I want to explain some of the foundations of this game this way it feels less awkward in the transistion to the mechanics and how this game is played.So to start. Little Inferno takes place in a time where the world is on apocolyptic-conditions due to the fact that the weather outside is in artic-conditions. Little Coporporation invented ""The Little Inferno"" to stall the arctic advances with creating a temporary source of heat emitted from the Little Inferno playsets (there's many theories and spoilers surrounding this subject, so i'll avoid that.). You have been given one of these playsets in-regards to your entertainment of setting a vast assortment of items on fire.Okay, in this game there's three main characters as you progress. The Weatherman who gives you up-to-date messages about the world and weather, Bubbles, who is your neighbor and also possess a Little Inferno Playset. And then there's the CEO of Little Inferno Corporation who sends you letters from time to time.To progress the story, you have to buy items to burn and then harvest the coins that drop from said burned items to purchase a more-expensive item. You continue doing this until you reach the end of a catalouge. Then you'll be given the option to buy the next catalouge, which has a fee requirement and a combo requirement.Combos, are essentially puzzles. You get a list of these said ""combos"" with a combo title and a clue to how many items are needed to achieve it.  To do this, you must figure out what items are involved in the combo and then you must buy them and then burn them altogther sharing the same flame. If the combo is correct, it will be checked off on your list and you'll be given stamps.Stamps, are used to fast-forward the time you have to wait for shipments to come to your home in the game. The longer amount of time it takes to get there, the more stamps it will cost. Essentially you can wait the time down to be something you'd be more comfortable spending. So say an item costs 7 stamps to instantly send it to your inventory, you can wait a minute or two and then have it sent directly to your house at the price of 3 stamps.Stamps are just used for when you're feeling a little impatient and want to speed things up. They are dropped randomly from a burned item from time to time.The game has good pacing as buying a new catalouge eats up a hearty wad of your cash. More or less forcing you to start from one or two catalouges in the past and work your way back up again. But it also gives you opportunity to figure out other combos as some combos cannot be completed until a new catalouge and item is unlocked.The special effects and sound effects in this game are quite good. There's high-definition effects mixed in with their art style and they work well with each other. Also this games good sense of dark humor is quite pleasing.I found it hard to find any issues with this game as any issues I have with it stems with the fact that I may have not been playing it relaxingly and casually. This game functions very well and it's items mechanics are quite good, no bugs, glitches or anything. Everything functions smoother than a hot blade through butter. It was a very good experience.The story behind the gameplay was very solid, and the games mechanics are simple but they're perfect and well-designed for a relaxing casual game like this.So, all in all. The sound effects are good and they make the proper sounds for all interactions I feel. The balance between the art-style and the graphics they used is well-done. The humor's good, the story's good. I can't complain about this game. At all. They know what they envisioned, and they made it and really made a perfectly functioning game and I commend them for that. Nothing seemed out of placed or a nail jagged out of the floorboards if you catch my drift.I have replayed Little Inferno 3 times, I am unsure of how many times people would replay this game. So I can't give a reasonable estimate for that other than you'll surely beat it once.I bought this game on sale, but it is most definitely worth the full price.Thank you for reading my review, I hope it has aided you in your consideration if you want to buy this product or not.Just know that even if you beat this game once and you wouldn't want to beat it again. ...you'll definitely return to just watch things burn in all their high-resoluted burning glory.Again, thanks for reading. Have a good one."

I like playing with fire, but i don't get that vibe out of Little Inferno, since it's mostly about waiting for new items to arrive, then they burn in a few seconds. Yet, I would write that down as personal preferences, and move on.But after that, it keeps getting worse. The wait timer become higher and higher, the money you need keep getting higher. So there is even less burning and a lot more waiting than before. Even at the end of the games, you will not get to do that much of a fire because ""express delivery coupons"" are so damn rare.I at least expected some kind of payoff when you ""finished"" the game, something that would raise it past the boring waiting mechanic...Well there is an ending...and it was almost as boring as the rest.Big disappointment.

,Not Recommended,221260,8156752,"Posted: 20 December, 2013",all,Shadowspaz,"This does not mean I did not enjoy the game- I greatly enjoyed it. But I cannot recommend this game to anyone I do not know: It is a very specific taste of game.This will not appeal to the average gamer. If you are looking for depth, you may enjoy it. If you are looking for a great gameplay experience, you likely won't. If you just want to burn everything, you'll love it. The gameplay is built around repetition and waiting, as a satire of AVGM and the pay-to-win formula used in Facebook games. But this means that the game is designed to be repetitive: Not a great trait in most games. And if you don't like waiting five minutes to burn a single thing, it'll cost you stamps, which are an in-game currency you slowly accumulate.The entire game takes place in front of a fireplace, with the exception of the end, which serves to teach a preachy lesson about wasted time. But there is more to it than that, if you're willing to look into it. The depth is a decent hook for game analysts, and the meaning of the ending is vague enough to be interpreted as a good number of things, all positive and optimistic. Most people won't look into this, though, and I don't blame them.The atmosphere is just as fantastic and eerie as World of Goo was (Same creator), with that silver lining lingering in the distance. The dialogue is kooky and fun, yet reveals a dark and sinister motive. But I expect most gamers' reactions to this would be ""so what?"" Atmosphere does not make the game. It cannot serve as the initial hook, and only becomes tangible when the player is immersed.So no, I don't recommend it. It has fantastic atmosphere. It has a dark theme. It has a sweet-but-simple ending. It has great idle gameplay. But you would need to be an ""artistic"" gamer to acknowledge most of this. If you don't look for atmosphere in games, you won't care about it in this one. If you play games to play games, this falls short of the criteria.However, my negative rating of this will likely draw people that are honestly researching into if they should get this game. And, as you read through my review, you may notice that I am not describing you. You may think ""I'm not an average gamer. These assumptions don't apply to me."" If that's the case, then enjoy Little Inferno, as I have."

I think even if they kept the timing system there should be a way to reduce the time like if gold items actually had no shipping time instead of just no cooldown. Its annoying to have to wait 2 minutes everytime you want to get an item. Exploring each catalouge and seeing the interactions is really fun, but the need to wait for every item really makes me wonder if it is worth it."

I bought the game because I was bored and burning things sounded entertaining (literally, that was all there was to the purchase).  I saw all the tags by gaming journalists that claimed it was a thought-provoking look into the demons of modern society... but I ignored them.  After playing it for a while I asked myself… were they right?  Is Little Inferno the reincarnated savior of gaming?  The answer is complicated, and as a disclaimer let me say that Little Inferno is a very player-driven experience; to some it will speak volumes, to others it will fall far short of the mark.I must admit that I haven't beaten the game; the tear-jerker of an ending has eluded me thus far.  Why haven't I beaten it, you ask?  To put it bluntly, the game isn't all that engaging.  Burning things is cool for a while, and hunting down the combinations of items to receive bonus points is amusing… but it doesn’t last.  Receiving letters from my neighbors and the weatherman – things that are supposed to be thought-provoking and emotional - get bogged down by the overly-satirical feel of the game.In the same way that some game worlds are grimdark to be grimdark, Little Inferno's world is dystopian to be dystopian.  The game is out to prove that we, as modern humans, sacrifice things like emotion and human contact for happiness – and it attempts to do so in a great, sweeping motion that’s supposed to knock our socks off.  I, personally, wasn’t impressed... though on this rare occasion I will tell you to draw your own conclusions."

,Not Recommended,221260,13706538,"Posted: 29 December, 2014",all,Dravvad,"Incredibly. Disappointing. I did NOT finish the game, nor will I ever bother with it again. Do NOT waste your money (although apparently that is the stupid, ironic point of the game?).I really do not understand people in today's society who swarm over things with cheeky, hidden messages, as if they are some sort of saving grace for something that is terrible. You know, create some horribly bad game or TV show, but if it has a ""fancy"" meaning between-the-lines, then it is suddenly the best thing ever.This game is not a game. I played it first and foremost because the photos and videos looked like it would be a funny little way to spend some time, mixing the toys and things together to do silly things, like the moon's gravity, or trying to buy enough blocks to make a little castle and then burn it down or drop something on it.And it was enjoyable in that way for a little while. But once the game started drastically delaying all of the toys when you bought them, I became very bored and annoyed very quickly. Taking away some time for me sitting with the game idle and chatting with a friend, I probably played the game less than 90 minutes. Apparently the average players go to like 5 hours to finish the game, because they have to finish burning items in these combos and so on?And once they finish the game, as I looked into it after I shut it off and decided not to go further, they're basically given a message (although I could see parts of it showing up already, after-the-fact) that they are wasting their time doing some stupid repetitive mess like playing iOS/Android games that are just collecting some dumb items and making coins.Okay... Except 1) This isn't really that game market; and 2) I realized the game was stupid, so I didn't even get near that point nor does it apply. So basically I wasted money on a game that looked really silly and fun, but only was fun for less than an hour. Everyone somewhat raves about the game, which made me feel safer in making the purchase, and often I'm skeptical about user judgment... and would have been right to be so here.People praise this game saying that it breaks out of its mold and is great with its message of ""dreams"" and ""living life."" Some people even compare it to games like Spec Ops (saying how Spec Ops is a dark and anti-fun shooting game). Now, I loved Spec Ops (I played it on Xbox first) and agree it's dark and has a great story, but I don't understand people claiming this game to fit with that. This game is nowhere near the same thing. Spec Ops has a general message about life and war, and so does many books, movies, documentaries, etc. It's not exactly a ""new"" message. If people think it is, that is mostly because they're young and simply don't understand life or the repercussions of things like war. Blowing people up in games is fun if you disconnect your mind from it, and it is easier in something like Halo. But in ""real"" war scenarios, it is harder.Anyway, I am off-track talking about Spec Ops somewhat, but the point is that this game is just a waste to take your money, but not in the same way as those dumb mobile games. There really isn't a saving grace here to be found. There is no good ""message"" or point."

World of Goo was incredible, so i decided to try some more by the same guy, but this was just a waste of money. It's got good reviews... idk, maybe there was some artsy element that I missed, but I was just but I was just bored.So you start off with a tiny stash of cash and a small collection of toys you can order. You order stuff and it appears after a delay, and then you toss it in the fireplace and burn it, which always gives you a few more coins than you spent. Symbolism for the insatiability hunger of human consumerism maybe? Idk, but it got old in a hurry.Most of the toys react in some novel way as you burn them... the dragon breaths fire, the ear of corn has popcorn pop off of it, the moon changes gravity so things orbit it. I imagine you could make some tiny rube-golberg machines if you were so inclined, but the space is so limited that it's pretty limited so I didn't have much success.Also there are hidden combos of items. If you burn certain items together, you've completed the combo. Once you've got enough, you unlock new toys to burn. So a big part of the game is looking at the titles of combos and trying to guess which toys are required, which is easy when you've only got access to a dozen items, but once it's closer to 100 it starts to take some trial and error. A message about sitting in the same place, looking at the same thing, and still searching for novelty? Might be a meta commentary about spending too much time on a computer looking for interesting games, but that might be something I'm superimposing on the subject.There's a thin plot about a relation with the girl next door. You get letters, and exchange toys with her. She's fascinated by a mystery of the inferno. And the environment of the game, the whispers of the world outside the inferno are quite haunting. But, that was the only interesting part of the game that I could see, but there wasn't much of it.Anyway, eventually you hit on a mystic combination of items and burn the house down, and then you've got to find something else to do. The end.I usually enjoy artsy games and games with social commentary. World of Goo kept surprising me with understanded but poignant imagery. Little inferno though? No so much.I unlocked all the items and completed the endgame, in about 3 hour, which was much shorter than I like to see a $10 game take. Maybe there was symbolism I missed, but this was just a waste of time and money as far as I could see."

You burn items, which turn into coins, which you use to buy new items to burn. The cycle repeats as you continue buying new items to burn. The ending is well worth the couple of hours it takes to complete and there are secondary objectives in the form of ""combos"" where you have to burn two specific items at the same time. You have to find the combinations on your own though. All in all, this is a casual, fun, albeit repetitive game with a fantastic ending."

Little Inferno seeks to recapture that spirit and feel to solidify how 2D Boy games are like.  Unfortunately it just doesn't leave the same lasting impression.The game starts off innocently enough just like World of Goo does.  You have a fireplace and a cutesy, but loomingly sinister setting about snow that never stops falling and that you bought a fireplace to burn things in to stay warm.  You burn things, get money, and buy more things to burn.  These objects come in themes with increasingly tongue-in-cheek jabs at consumerism in general.  There is a surprising amount of little details in pretty much everything but at the same time, it really loses that luster and subtle humor after the first few times you burn something and it starts screaming.  However, as you keep playing, you realize about half-way through that this is all the game is and it quickly overstays its welcome.  Unlocking things is an incredibly lengthy process and finding all the various combos, that range from obvious to clever to straight up random, can sometimes be an exercise in straight guesswork.The visuals and sounds are highly reminiscent of World of Goo which from I figure seems to be the developers' attempt at a unique style which does suit the game rather well.  It's fairly easy to get absorbed in the atmosphere but it's also very easy to break said atmosphere.  The nods to World of Goo are ever present, but it almost feels like they draw too much from their past success to remind you how artsy and anti-establishment they are- almost to the point of tedium.The biggest problem with Little Inferno is that unlike World of Goo, you have to not only push yourself to finish it but there's absolutely no value in playing it more than once.  If you've done everything the first go around, the only thing you can do differently is not burn a single item you get early on that changes a single passing line of dialogue at the end.  It set itself up almost to feel like a spiritual successor to the beloved little puzzle game that I still highly recommend to anyone who would want to play it, but it wound up being too similar to World of Goo to stand out on its own, and too different from it to really hold my attention.It's been a while since I uninstalled and forgot about the game, and in hindsight, I kind of regret paying the full $15 for this one when it came out.  Fans of World of Goo or artsy indie stuff in general will still find something to enjoy from it, though.  It's not a bad game in its own right, but its lack of lasting presence really hurts it in the end.  You'll play it once and forget about it."

Without giving away any spoilers, I was moved by the emotional and extremely eye-opening moral of the game. Its characters were all special in there own way, putting their own twist on the story. Having purchased quite a few games during the recent Steam sale, I found the majority of them to be fun, but lacking in storyline. Little Inferno is just the opposite, putting player in close-to tear-jerking, edge of the chair positions. The developers are able to do this using astonishing music and well thought out letters from the people you are able to interact with. These letters can put you in a state of excitement, wonder, or even sadness as you worry for your companions. In conclusion, I thoroughly enjoyed this game and think that everyone should play it.

You buy stuff with in game currency, you burn said stuff, and get money from burning it to buy more stuff. Each item, however, will react differently to the flame. There is a plot involved, but that's not where the game shines.The game's biggest selling point is the creativity with each item. Many items have special effects when burned, and some will interact with each other.However, there is a major drawback to this game: it has absolutely no replayability factor. Once you've beaten the game, once you've unlocked all of the items, and once you've accomplished all of the combos (or get bored of trying to figure them out), you're likely done with this game forever. There isn't any modding support to add new items, they don't come out with new item packs every now and then, and watching the same things burn over and over again, no matter how creative they are, gets tiring.Again, overall this is a decent game. However, it is a game you will only play once or twice."

But that action is pretty fun: the fireplace is fun, the combo-searching is fun, thesnap-crackle-POPas things go up in flames is very fun.then all of this is interlaced with an emerging narrative that pretty much just sheds light on what's clear from the start--that ""something is very wrong here""; that this thing that you're just sitting there staring it isn't really making you happy or healthy. While that's not surprising, the narrative is very engagingly and tensely teased out, so that I found myself playing long after I was tired and the fun-action of throwing stuff into the fireplace had lost some of its luster, because I was really invested in the story. Which has, thankfully, an elegant and optimistic conclusion.Lastly, the music is terrific; deliberately evocative and sweeping and terrific.It's a great game that's a commentary on gaming and a great game in its own right.

,Recommended,221260,16738974,"Posted: 27 June, 2015",all,[PunLife],"Little Inferno is yet another stylish creation by Tomorrow Corporation, the creators of World of Goo (which is a fantastic game in my opinion).Just like World of Goo, Little Inferno has a very peculiar art style, which despite its oddness is rather aluring. The game revolves around the player burning different objects in a fireplace in order to both entertain himself as well as warm the house up. Lovely prospect don't you think? The objects that the player gets to burn are fairly varied, with more getting unlocked as the player earns money and completes special combinations. The combinations are simply 2 or more objects that have to be burnt at the same time. The game is fairly addictive, up to a point in which you realise that you're laughing while burning a school bus full of screaming children. Yup. That's when I realised that this game helped me develop a secret fixation with burning school buses.In all seriousness though, this game is a great time consumer and actually does make the player question their sanity at times, as well as the consequences of their actions in game. I definitely recommend it as its both enjoyable and excellent at relieving stress accumulated on a bad day."

I'm sorry if I seem offensive, but you really havn't put alot of time into this game, it would seem. You probably didn't even play after the game was beaten, which, sure, there are other things to life than just video games and, as is said in the game: ""If you've got everything you ever dreamed about, dream bigger."" which is a really nice way to leave the player, plus, the end leaves you with such a feeling of adventure, even though you probably won't be able to see what our little hero is going to do after the plot of this amazing game ends, your imagination can still run wild with what they can do, now that they know that thereis more to life than just a fireplace and some fire, some letters and some cash, which makes the experience of this game all the more worth-while, as it is quite obvious that this game is almost poking fun at how, we as gamers, sometimes tend to start to think that while they are playing a game, there is nothing to life but you, a controller and the game. So next time you want to run your mouth off at this game for things that actually make this game all the more complelling and fun, (like waiting for more toys to arrive in the mail (which actually happens in the real world, unlike most games, where you can pull a giant rocket launcher out of nowhere and still have a good amount of ammo for it, while being able to run around faster than most other people) which most people would be farmiliar with from their childhoods, checking the mail everyday, waiting excitedly for your toy to arrive, which is very present in this game) you should think about what would happen if everything happend instantly, which would result in boredom much faster, as you would have everything you want just like that, which would remove any meaning from the process of getting everything ready for when you make a huge fire that sometimes feels like you could burn your house down. Remember this next time you play this game, you might notice something that adds charm to the game, or you could just miss it because you are over-exaggerating about how long it takes to deliver something when you have plenty of instant-mailing stamps right there in your inventory."

,Recommended,221260,16710901,"Posted: 25 June, 2015",all,Lowbacca1977,"Little Inferno is a great game, but it's important to know what it is. On the simplest level, it's simply burning things in a fireplace. What impresses me so much with this is that the physics of burning stuff is done quite well, and there's something satisfying just watching stuff burn (as there should be) and that alone was fun to play with for a while.The next level is the combo system, whereby you get some extra perks by burning certain objects together. For the most part, these can be figured out with a bit of thinking, although there's a few of them that I think are not 'good' solutions. Or at least, I think there's more sensible solutions to it. There's 99 combos, and I'd say about 2/3rds can be gotten relatively easily, but the last few can be really tricky.On the final level, there's a sort of plot-based undercurrent in here that I think is really interesting initially, but ultimately unsatisfying. It is sorta similar to how World of Goo had a similar plot that is introduced very subtly. I really wish that the plot had been a bit more fleshed out, I get hints of a larger message it was meant to lead to, but it feels indecisive about it.Overall, the game's a fun 4-5 hours and I think there's a good sense of humour to it. There's some forced waiting in the game that I think could've been reduced so that late game was less tedious at points (particularly when trying to figure out combos). That said, unlike World of Goo, there really isn't replay value, unless you enjoy watching the fire. There's nothing to go back and try to earn once you have figured out all the combos so I do think it's important to know that buying this game is buying a 4-5 hour experience and not much more than that."

Yes, there is a refreshing commentary on vidya and how we use it, but let's explore some other aspects of the game;The narrative is good. The story isn't spectacular, but it's good. Takes about 3 hours to work your way through it.The execution of the narrative, however, is astounding. Beautifully constructed and emotionally gripping, perfectly compensating for the raw story's imperfections. Everything from the soundtrack to the use of the fireplace as a story-explorative platform worked perfectly.Also, it's fun. It's just plain fun. The whole process of buying and burning stuff is just simply enjoyable.There's a freeplay mode if you like it that much.Lastly, the puzzle-aspect - the finding combinations - is great fun and embellishes the sandbox with some much-needed direction. More items and puzzles would be a great step forward, providing a fun sandbox with a bit more direction, but in its current state, any buyers will absolutely be getting their money's worth.In conclusion, buy the game. At the time of review, it's about 2 dollars. You won't regret this."

It's quirky, weird, and oddly engrossing. You're a kid with not much, but you do have a magic fireplace and a directive to burn stuff because it's apparently been snowing forever outside. Everything given to you can (and should) be set on fire, and fortunately you can do this just by pointing at it (holding down controller or mouse button as appropriate).I'll be honest and admit it was the two preview videos on the Steam store page which caused me to have to buy the game. I just couldn't not. It's like being inside an episode of Ren & Stimpy.As you burn stuff, it produces coins which you can then use to purchase more items to burn, and as you buy more items, it unlocks more catalogs of stuff to buy. (Bit of a consumerism message in there, I should think.) The only real challenge sometimes is figuring out all of the various combinations of items which, when burned together, produce bonuses and little achievement messages. (I'll give you one obvious combo: Pirate toy + boat.)  At times, you receive letters from people -- Miss Nancy, who apparently runs the Little Inferno program. A girl in the same predicament as you. And a weather guy in a balloon. (Yes, you burn their letters, too.)After you've burned everything you can burn... well, let's just say the ending is pretty good. Not so sure the game is worth the original list price unless you have more than one person in your household, but it is absolutely worth the price when on sale. At least I thought so."

The only thing I didn't quite like about the game is the timer element on some of the items.  While the game gives you LOTS of ""stamps"" used to speed up the time to take for items to be ready, it felt strange sometimes to feel like I needed to alt tab while playing a game to check reddit or something while I waited for items to be ready to burn. If you're smart about stamps, though, you'll never have to wait more than maybe 30 seconds. Fun, and occasionally meta?"

But then I started and it was somehow exceedingly addicting.Incredibly simple in concept, but beautifully executed. The story is well layered, but simple enough for anyone to play. Sure, you just starts by burning things, but you're immersed in this world they've created. Some of the things do more than just burn; the marshmallows smile and the bus full of children scream, and the combos are clever and can be challenging.Let's add all the cuteness and simplicity on top of a slightly disturbing storyline and we've got Little Inferno!"

But just saying that it's ONLY about setting things on fire is a very huge disservice to the game and it's creators. The game has a very interesting story, if you're willing to venture far enough into it. One momment you're justing playing with your fire place set, and then the next, you're looking around trying to figure out was is happening. The game is very addictive to say the least but it isn't without it's downsides (Every game has one and this is no acception). I often found myself playing on my phone or something else, just waiting for the stupid timers to go down, and some of the combos had me scratching my head for a good amount of time. And I won't lie, it did take while to actually get me into the game, but after you get some of the items, your mouth might jsut drop to the floor in AWE.So in short, give it a chance before dismissing it as boring or to simplistic. Create your own combos, see what kinda weird and crazy things you can come up with. 9/10 would burn it all again. :P"

I find that personally I enjoy this kind of game much more when I'm feeling down or just need something casual and laid back to play. It's not an overwhelming first person shooter with all kinds of customizables. No. Its a fun little puzzle game.When I bought this back in December of 2012. I had just gone through surgery and just wanted a game to play. It was uncomfortable to play the typical action packed games I'm often playing, so this was a nice change. Running off medication, the game somehow seemed even weirder than it should have been! That said, It was super easy to pick up on the gameplay mechanics and I had a lot of fun trying to mix and match all the catalog items.The story was zany yet maintained a cheerful and cutesy vibe for the most part. It has the ability to be innocent enough while still creeping you out on occasion. If you're a completeionist, you'll probably spend most of your time trying to figure out all the different combos you can make!

I cannot really say much without some spoilers, however there is a little more to this game than the fireplace. Oh, and don't burn the Free Hug Coupon, it's a free hug? Who can complain.

The game is quite short and doesn't really have that much replay value, and there really isn't that much to do once you get all the combos which can still be done within hours. Once you get all the combos it really doesn't offer you that much to do. Sure you still get to burn stuff, even after you completed the story line and after you got all the combos, but by then that'll have gotten a bit old since the gameplay honestly is repetative, but still quite satisfying to see how different stuff burns.So, is it worth $10? I'd have to say no, but should you get it? I'd say yes, but wait until it goes on sale before you do."

It's a simple puzzle game where you place objects in the fireplace and lit them up and try to create combo's from the different reactions the toys have to fire and destruction.You start with some coins which always gradually increase as you burn more and more and as you burn newer things and complete combo's you unlock more pages of items you can order and burn.Along with this is an eerie storyline told through mail from your neighbour and others along with other little details about the world. The futility of the world growing colder and you and everyone's desperate attempts at trying to heat yourselves up is chilling.So yeah, atmosphere is great. Gameplay is simplistic but fun and unique. The storyline is light but through its storytelling it doesn't need a heavy narrative.Only problem I have with the game is that some of the combo's don't make a whole lot of a sense and forced me to use a wiki to cheat.

I wasn't sure what to expect when I bought it, but I do enjoy burning things so I went for it. What I found was a clever little game centered around burning things in a fireplace while receiving messages from the outside world. There is a steady progression as you burn things in combos to unlock more catalogues with more things to burn, and there is an engaging story happening at the same time via letters you receive. There are goals you can achieve such as unlocking all the combos, earning stars on all the catalogues and reaching the end of the story. However, I spent a lot of time just burning things. Most of the objects have animations that are activated when they are set on fire. Here's a tip - burn the edge of the object rather than just setting fire to the middle so you don't miss out on the clever animations. For example, there is a boat that will simply explode if you burn the middle. If you burn an outer edge, you get to watch it spurt oil and then fire before blowing up. The burning is great - oil paintings melt, fragile things are quickly reduced to ash, metal things leave charred skeletons. The only feature I would have liked to have seen would be a way to make up your own combos and share them with others. If you're looking for something different that you can enjoy at a leisurely pace, this game is an excellent choice."

Here's my take: it does have a message, but if you've already played World of Goo, you've already heard it.  Their messages are about as subtle as a strategic nuclear weapon, and they of course satirize culture, industrialization, and so forth.  One gets the feeling that these fellows would use the word ""sheeple"" in conversation without irony.So grading it on what it intends to be, it does well.  The gameplay is casual and roughly amusing, and their sense of humor is bitingly sharp.  If you're right of center and sensitive, it'll probably tick you off.  Me, being the pinko that I am, find myself agreeing with its theses but not its attitude.  It's more than happy to point out flaws everyone knows about, but offers no solutions (nor does it really suggest that anything can be solved).  It's the ""Folk Song Army"" of message-driven computer games: well-intentioned and sweet-tongued but generally ineffectual and not particularly helpful."

Made by the same company that made World of Good, The Tomorrow Corporation, I knew I could expect a few things from this game:-An eerie but endearing artstyle.-A more than mildly distressing distressing story.And of course, absolute insanity.I can safely say that it disappointed in none of these respects. In this game, the main character is a child, burning toys and other objects in a fireplace to stay warm through a mysterious and never-ending winter. Burning items gives you currency and unlocks more things to burn, allowing you to gradually unlock more things to play with as well as more of the story.Items burn in unique and often realistic ways, and the game give the player enough item variety and space to work with to keep this fresh for several hours, just long enough to see the story through to it's conclusion.My only gripe with the game lies in the item cooldowns and delivery times, which seem to be nothing more than a tool to extend the gametime due to an overall lack of content. There is a system in place to combat this, in the form of stamps awarded for solving rather simple puzzles involving burning specific combinations of items, but I didn't really feel that it added much to the game.The character dialogue and the design of the multitude of burnable items in the game are absolutely charming all the way through. I certainly enjoyed Little Inferno while it lasted, but it's hard to say whether or not it was quite worth the $15 pricetag.I'll just say that if a game where you haphazardly order items out of a catalogue only to shovel them into a firepit and see how well they immolate together sound like fun, you may want to give Little Inferno a look.

Little Inferno is indeed a game about setting fire to things but a game that simplistic also pulls of something unique. This game is very emotional. It makes you happy and joyful that you have fun and nobody gets hurt, it makes you feel guilty when some objects cry and scream, it makes you sad along the way of the story and most of all it makes you question what you're doing with your life. IF YOU READ ON CERTAIN PARTS OF LITTLE INFERNO MAY BE SPOILED. SPOILER ALERT. Throughout Little Inferno I've had a blast. Only when Sugar Plumps (a background character) seemingly died in a house fire did I first question what I was doing and realise some of it seemed wrong. Later in the story you see Sugar Plumps never died in the fire, she escaped and has lived free for years and years, whilst you've spent your entire life sitting behind your Little Inferno Entertainment Fireplace burning stuff. It makes you feel things and question things. THE SPOILERS HAVE STOPPED NOW. Never have I ever played a game this simplistic, yet this emotional. Little Inferno is an amazing and emotional game. I'd absolutely recommend this game although it is highly addictive and may seem like you are like the protagonist of Little Inferno.SPOILER NOTE THEORY THING: I think the Tomorrow Corporation were trying to tell us something with Little Inferno.

,Not Recommended,221260,9273761,"Posted: 26 February, 2014",all,Dinoracha,"Calling Little Inferno a 'game' is difficult for me, as it's really more of a interactive toy than a proper game. That said, there is a win condition and a ending leading to the credits, but there is no lose condition, no way to reach a game over screen, which is drastically different in comparison to World of Goo, where failing a level means you outright fail and have to start at the beginning again. World of Goo was a actual game with a heart, emotion and a wonderful soundtrack, but Little Inferno fails to really bring the game aspect to the table, making it hard for me to recommend as a video game purchase for longevity, but easy for me to recommend as a cheap purchase if you want to experience an odd story of pyromania.Little Inferno has you becoming the 'proud' (large emphasis on those quotes, there) owner of the Little Inferno fireplace kit from Tomorrow Corporation, a fireplace that will incinerate anything put inside of it. Anything. From wooden blocks to squeaky toys to expired medication to miniature moons, you purchase items from catalogues supplied to you from the corporation which are mailed directly to you to toss into your fireplace to send up in a puff of smoke, leaving only ashes and coins behind. These coins always reward you with more money than the original purchase, and through this cycle you will burn more, unlock more, and eventually find out the 'secret' behind why you never tear yourself away from staring at the fireplace.Now, I could sit here and babble on to you about the psychological fascination with just tossing stuff into the fireplace, dragging your mouse around and watch it go ablaze, but really, there's only one major reason to complete Little Inferno; the WHY. World of Goo had you wondering why the goo balls made their treacherous pilgrimage around the world getting sucked up by giant vacuums, and Little Inferno will have you wondering why the world outside is slowly freezing over, why your neighbor has downright gone insane with her own Little Inferno, and why you're eternally stuck there just burning things for money. To give any clue to what the answers are would be to spoil the 'story', which even if the game is shallow in its gameplay department, its big twist near the end is, I say, worth price of admission, even if a lot of questions are never truly answered. Like World of Goo, not much has to be said when the music grabs you, holds you still, and just shows you without the need for dialogue. I'll admit, when you heed your neighbors advice near the end of the game and something big happens, I was brought to tears. Not much was said, and not much needed to be said as things played out and the music did all the talking.The eerie art style and somber, subdued soundtrack (save for more dramatic moments later) are easy on the eyes much like World of Goo, and it's kinda fun to try and complete the combination challenges, where a list gives you the name of a combo and you must burn those items in unison to complete it and gain stamps, which you can use to instantly have an item delivered to you. These combo's are also required to unlock better catalogues and complete the game, making it somewhat of a grind once later combo's requiring three or four items get in your way. I completed Little Inferno in a little over three hours (all in one sitting), and that's including me getting through all the catalogues at a pretty good rate while goofing around to complete combo's. Even if I blew all my money with failed combinations, spiders creep down your chimney to give you small amounts of money, again showing there is no way to lose in this game, only win.At $14.99 (at this writing, it's currently $9.99 on Steam), I cannot tell you to go out and purchase Little Inferno, even if its ending is worth seeing for yourself after spending a few hours burnin' and burnin' some more. Due to Steam's Christmas sale, I bought my version for under ten dollars, completed the game in the one sitting, and have yet to come back to it, not even to complete all the combinations. Little Inferno is a one trick pony, plain and simple, but its one trick was one that brought me to an emotional level, considering all you do is just set♥♥♥♥♥♥on fire and get rewarded for doing so. World of Goo would be a much better use of your money since it's an actual game with conditions for winning/losing plus it has good gameplay, but if you ever have some money to burn and Little Inferno is on sale, go for it. You'll probably never come back to it again, but it's little, sweet story will certainly touch you, while it lasts."

About 98% of the game is just burning things, a task that I found to be a waste of time since what generally draws me to games are good plots and well developed characters. I got the game because I was told that its storyline was really good, but it's less of a storyline and more of an ironic message you get at the end. Certainly, I can see how Little Inferno could be fun, but for those expecting an engaging plot or characters, this is not the right game. If you enjoy puzzle games or games that don't focus on story, you may like Little Inferno. I enjoyed receiving messages from my neighbor and finding combos was occasionally amusing, but overall it seemed to me that the majority of this short game was just fluff to fill the time. While that is kind of the point, that doesn't do anything to justify the cost and time spent up."

I first saw this game played on YouTube and I bought it thinking it would be a neat little time-consumer. Was I ever wrong! Little Inferno is much more than just burning stuff and watching the flames flicker out. There is a depth here you wouldn't expect at first glance. It's a short game (I completed it in just over 7 hours, but I also spent a lot of time distracted, and making sure I got all 99 combos, some of which are a little...vague), and yet it ends on a high note that made my heart swell at 5 in the morning.The graphics are a little bit Tim Burton; unique, peculiar, and that sort of creepy-cute; the fire effect is realistic and oddly comforting. The music is fantastic andemotional, when it picks up you reallyfeelit; it's not just background noise. Gameplay is pretty standard and easy to grasp (click-and-drag, mostly), and the only thing really holding you back are the combos, which are mostly obvious - the more vague ones feel rather satisfying to complete.If you want a rather quick game that's fun to play, easy to understand, and surprisingly multi-faceted and emotional - buy Little Inferno."

Your entire universe is limited to this cheminee, neighbour letter, news about weather, and your pad. In fact, I think this is the best madness metaphora ever made : you do anyway the same action, trying to do it better (why and how, this is YOUR problem) expecting something new to happen. And you will necessarly try to do all the combos you have to discover and unlock all the items to buy, because of... your sense of perfection maybe ?And finally (and after around 4 hours of playtime) something happens that totally change your vision of the game...

It's not long, it's not  replayable in a ""finding something new"" sense.But then, its so much more than this. Its a message, it's emotional. I can not disclose or hint what the message is, for that would be spoiling the entire experience. But it should be played, and it should be played to the end (which was somewhat over four hours for me). It's beautiful, it's potentially deeply disturbing, but it's brilliant.p.s. it's also very interresting to read some reviews about it (I suggest, even if that seems wrong, to read those AFTER you played it). There are some reviewers who ""get it"", and some that treat it purely for its game content, which is (minor spoiler alert) somewhat ironic.tl;dr: total recommendation"

That's it! That is to say: it's not a point that can be counted against it.So many games fail to balance story, with gameplay elements. In my experience- Little Inferno leans just a little bit more towards the 'story' aspect; but that is only true because the gameplay lacks variety, save for the objects in which you burn.What I liked:> Burning things! It's simple, and fun to play with.> The overall story arc, and the not-so-deep meaning to the game.What I disliked:> Lack of variety when it came to objects, a lot of objects were either an upgraded version of a previous object- or a 'mix and match' of effects.Little Inferno is a basic set-things-on-fire sandbox, for the pyromaniac in all of us. If you're willing to spend the money: you too could own your very own, special, spectacular, Little Inferno Entertainment Fireplace.Just don't expect it to have much replay value.

,Recommended,221260,16367278,"Posted: 13 June, 2015",all,Andy,"The only real objective is to set things on fire. The whole game is set in a single fixed camera view of a fireplace. You use coins to purchase a variety of objects to set on fire, and if you set specific items on fire at the same time, it counts as a combo which gives you a bonus. That process alone, buying each item and doing each combo, took about 5 hours for me to do. For such a simple premise, there's a lot of content to work with.It's not just a singular concept, though. There's an underlying plot. That too is a bit simple, but it's still very interesting. I find it might be more enjoyable to personally experience learning the plot, rather than read about it from someone else. And for me, there were two parts of plot development that I found somewhat disturbing/freaky/unsettling - which I find a positive attribute, because rarely can a game affect me on that level.Either way, it's just a fun way to spend time. I think it has replayability, because even after seeing all the objects set on fire, it's still cool to mess around with putting together multiple objects to see the outcome, but also simply because you get to set things on fire, so it's fun to just start it up for a quick session just for that sake."

The watch what happens part is where all the amusement is.  There are combos and some of the items synergize as they start burning together in an amusing spectacle of fire, noise, and motion.  Progress is linear, you burn stuff until you get access to new collections of things to burn until you get to the last collection of things to burn and finally figure out the combo to end the game.I spent so much time facinated by the spectacle of watching fire I forgot how simple and bland the game is.
