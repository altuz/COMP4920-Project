,Recommended,221380,18384948,"Posted: 8 October, 2015",all,Panteri,"Oh boy, where do I begin? I've been playing this game since it was released as a demo for maximum pc back in 1998. My father showed me it at a computer store that he used to work at in the small community that we used to live in. I was only 4 years old at that time, and I remember the only civilizations you could be were the Brits and Celts. I first laid eyes on the scout calvary, would ignore the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of everything else, because he looked cool in my eyes at 4 years of age. Since then, Ive been playing this game on and off, I'm 21 now, and I still find myself latched on to it. I now have a daughter of my own, although she won't know what it was like to see the game evolve over the course of 16 years, she will still know how it came to be, assuming she would even find it as cool as I have growing up. I think for me at least it was the growing anticipation of seeing something new with every civ, while still keeping the basics of the game simple and the same in it's own ways. I used to play this during lunch break in middle school from 2006-2009 with all of my friends, for the most part, I came out on top, even had our own little community of players, formed our own club, and we made a board game out of it. It was pretty cool that not all of us were premature nerds that played this, at least half of our little community were jocks that just loved it as much as we did, and there was no discrimination involved in any of it.  We amassed to a total of 20 or more people in this community, and for a small amount of us, our community is still strong with new members and old. This game is called Age of Empires II, and it will stand the test of time for the ages. I'm happy and delighted that people are still playing this game 16 years later, and we're still finding newcomers for this game at as faster rate than before. I've come to realize that just since early 2014 I have ended up spending hundreds of hours playing this game, teaching people both young and old what to do in this game. I'm so thrilled to see that this game is coming out with new expansions still to this day, even after 16 years. I think that if I were to find the gold edition realeased back in 2004 without the package being opened or torn, I would keep it as a collector's item, this game has so much potential and I'm happy to see that it's not being thrown away in to the trash. I honestly believe that when I die of old age, assuming that I don't die any other way, I will more than likely have a copy in my coffin for when my body gets discovered generations later, people will know what kind of influence this game had on my life as much as anyone else's life. I honestly didn't even play the Conqueror's expansion pack until 2007, even though I knew about it unpon release date, my mother refused me video games, so I never got to play it on time like most of my friends did, but I knew that I would at some point in time. Due to my parents seperation back in 2001 shortly after my mother's mother died, I ended up living with my mother, as she got the majority of custody except on holidays when I would be with my father. Whenever I was with him, he would let me play games, even though it was against my mother's wishes. I really loved playing as the Celts, Britons, Franks, Goths, and Vikings, at the time, they were my favorite. Now and again however, you will find me riding along Genghis Khan's horde as the Mongols, however, you can also find me still enjoying the company of the Goths and Britions. I love all of the civilizations very much, I know that they all have their strengths and weaknesses, some are greater than others. My best advice to you is to rush your enemies into the dirt while still keeping up with your economy via micro manage. I would rate this game a solid 10/10 and would also highly recommend it to anyone who still finds the old RTS game to be complexed and fun. I can't wait for the new expansion to come out November 5th 2015 African Kingdoms will have without a doubt in my mind as many new features as it pre successors. I hope you all have a try at this game, it's for sure my favorite game of all time."

Now supporting all HD resolutions, reworked terrain, water & building textures/sprites, it definetly looks better than it did a decade ago. Gameplay is left mostly untouched, with the only notable change being a pop cap increase to 500. Multiplayer is handled through steam, meaning (generally) more stable MP, but with the caveat that LAN got removed from this version.The constant support and existing features makes this a version to get even if you still have your old copy laying around."

I played a lot of this game, mainly singleplayer back in 2006, but scratched the CD a couple years later. When I found it had been remastered on Steam I was quick to purchase myself a copy and have been playing both singleplayer and multiplayer since. For those of you who used to own a copy like myself, I highly advise purchasing this digital edition, as it offers both the same nostalgic gameplay and a great strategic outlet. The Forgotten DLC also gives you more to explore and adds even greater variety to an already extensive game. I highly recommend this title, as it has quickly (re)become a personal favorite.For those of you who haven't played Age of Empires before, it was one of the older RTS games dating back to the late 90s / early 21st century. I'm surprised more people don't play it. You are given a wide selection of civilizations with specific perks each, and try to race each other towards an objective, be it a Wonder Race, Deathmatch, or King of the Hill. All of which are great fun! What really stands out with this game is that there are hundreds, if not thousands of ways to win. Granted, the mechanics may seem simple and outdated, but when trying to runn an entire empire with 200+ units against up to seven other players, every click counts as you try to out-maneuver, out-think, and out-micro your opponent. The graphics may take a while to get used to, but what you really should look forward to enjoying is the satisfaction of wrecking the strong defenses of an enemy with allies or alone, and conquering lands one by one. A great title, I also highly advise purchasing this for the newer community."

After 16 years, it still stands in a league of its own. Simple to use, this software is utilized by the likes of Fortune 500 companies and top tier business schools for training and retaining skills. Furthermore, it doubles as an entertaining and interactive platform for learning about the Middle Ages.HRM Simulator 99’ takes place in a historical period running from the fall of the Western Roman Empire to the dawn of the Colonial Age. You will be placed in the role of a medieval leader seeking to build your kingdom and defeat your opponents. In order to win, however, you will need to micromanage your human resources with the utmost efficiency and effectiveness.Central to your efforts is the villager. Villagers are the ideal worker. They can work for indefinite periods of time while earning nothing and aptly work several different jobs throughout your kingdom. They can handle everything from construction to fishing to sapping enemy buildings. Your villagers are also loyal to you beyond question; they will even gather berries while wolves are mauling them to death.Once you have established a perfectly efficient economy using the principles of operations management, you will have to shift your attention to raising an army and defeating your enemies. As a human resources manager at Proctor & Gamble put it, “HRM Simulator 99’s army management is good preparation for some of the most daunting tasks that a new manager may face in the real world”. While managing your army in battle, you will also still need to pay attention to your economy, keeping your villagers on task and away from becoming useless, idle drones.Campaigns (Spoilers?):Play as Mel Gibson and beat up the army of a dude named Edward Longshanks who, despite his last name, cannot shank anything for long.Play as a teenage chick, summon Shelby Cobras for horny Frenchmen so that they can shoot up snotty Britons.Play as a legendary ISIS commander and defeat NATO forces in Israel.Play as Genghis Khan, travel the world and break down the Great Wall of China with an extraordinarily fast & furious monkey.Play as der Fuhrer, subdue domestic opposition, invade Poland and convince Italy to side with you.

In 5 months it'll be 20 years and people still want part 4 which most probably never come. Since the last part it's been over 10 years. Do you guys even remember that book which was released by Microsoft Studios which showed up AoE 4 and 5? I guess we all believe there was suppose to be 4/5. Wasn't it actually Bill Gates who said he'll look into that (answer for question what's up with AoE 4?)1999 was the year of original Age of Empires 2: The Age of Kings and year later expansion The Conquerors. Don't tell me it didn't affected your childhood, growing or just lifetime in general as a gamer? That game was (is) incredible. 13 years later instead of Age of Empires IV we've recieved HD remaster. It's easier to remaster something that was already done than create something new right? Times of remasters.Now, this remaster wasn't bad at all. There are several pros. Most importantly, fan base. Secondly actual game at Steam Store (no idea if there was SD edition, if so write in comment please). Another pros contains working and great multiplayer, actual HD and the fact that you can just relive it all once again.I don't even know if there's something to say about this game. It has its campaign, that contains another campaign that  contains another campaign and same with The Conquerors + respective DLC content. So if you don't feel to play Skirmish yet or Scenarios or just free build then do campaign. But Skirmish at least for me is main element why I've played this game. And of course you start with nothing, nowhere, uneducated paesant and end up kinging your own Empire that will crush your enemies like nothing.There is just f*ckton of nations (+ DLC nations) so you have really big selection and yes every have its own bonuses. Architecture looks really great, buildings, units and everything just like good old times. Wonders are spectacular. Architecture of new DLCs is also really beautiful. (No, I'm not hard on DLC content whatsoever). Game also have various game modes such as King of the Hill, Wonder Defense, Wonder Destroying, Relic Captures, DM and lot more.It's really hard to tell how long Age of Empires II lasts for you. It just all depends what you prefer and how long it can keep you entertained. Some can get bored in few hours, somebody is still going to enjoy it even after 500 hours. I'm on over 150 at the moment, and I must say I'm really exhausted. So do your math.Price point is kinda friendly especially during sale so don't think about it twice if you like RTS games.Multiplayer can get very interesting sometimes, sometimes laggy as hell sometimes smooth as I don't know, skin of some smooth human being. However it also depends on what you like. Me personally I don't like big farming and just rushing everything, so I enjoy more playing MP with all friends in lobby so there's no serious rush. But if you like opposite then hop into that MP or SP with hard CPU and it will be your heaven.There used to be a lot of bugs and glitches back in 2013 even with both SP and MP but everything is calm now and you can enjoy it to the max.Last thing before end I want to adress are achievements. For me personally definition of Achievement is not to keep me in game longer than I should already be. If you want to keep me in game way way way way waaaay longer when I was already suppose to be done, that's not Achievement for me. Achievement should expose every element of the game possible. Achievement should cover every existing aspect of the game or action you can done without holding you inside game for too long. So if anybody thought it would be wise to put achievements like these in Age of Empires II HD was clearly nuts. Yes it covers everything, but it fairly exceeded anything sane.Bonus Point: Nostalgia of 1999Rating: 8.5/10"
,Recommended,221380,7747248,"Posted: 25 November, 2013",all,VeroMagnifico,"Age of Empires II HD is a classic strategy game and a must-have for both old and new fans of the RTS genre. Although, the original game was realised in 1999 it managed to stand the test of time due to its unique art style.The gameplay is simple to learn but hard to master. As you begin in the Dark Ages and try to advance your civilisation to the Imperial Age. A good building order is important for maintaining an optimal economy to support your war machine. It does not feature unique abilities that units can utilise and therefore it does not require the extensive micro-management as seen in games such as Starcraft II and Warcraft III. Actually, the introduction movie of the game says it all as two kings play a game of chess, the pieces representing units in the game. This is how Age of Empires feels, a real time chess game where every move matters and momentum is key.As an added bonus the soundtrack of the game is amazing, although I do miss the original menu music. However, thanks to the support of the Steam Workshop, there is a mod to fix that (and many other things). Overall, the HD version is what it says: an update of the already impeccable original game with better textures and HD resolution support."

Best part was they released an expansion after more than a decade because this game has such a cult following.The game has you gather resources, build structures, amass units and go trapsing over maps of all kinds. These range from tiny islands to pretty decent sized representations of European climates that have you seek out and destroy your enemies or win by several other not-so-total conquest game types. The new expansion allows those maps to be massive and adds even more civilizations to play with, making the total 23. These civilizations span from all corners of Europe, Asia and the Middle East. All units have voice clips in their native languages to help with the feel of every faction being truly different in addition to visually unique buildings and units depending on the cultural locale of your civilization.With its migration to Steam AoE now has great multiplayer support, achievements, and Steam Workshop capabilities that will allow the sharing of user-created content to be spread much easier than having to download things like scenario  maps from a third-party webpage over dial-up as I did back in the day.If you played this game in the past, it is well worth picking up again if nothing more than for nostalgia goggle syndrome because you know just how fun this was. If you somehow missed the boat in the past and are a fan of games like this there is literally no reason you should not own this game. It has been improved and will more than likely be considered one of the fine wines of gaming; Better with age and enjoyed even more with friends."

The HD version is a delight and they also added multiplayer support and decently-priced DLC. The remake is among the best i’ve played.If you don’t know what AoE2 is, you are in for a sweet treat, a blast from the past, a game of… much fame? Alright I’ll stop.AoE2 is a RTS in which you play one of many olden civilizations, starting in the Dark Ages, and progress all the way to the Imperial Age, all while expanding, building an army, creating defences, researching military/industrial/agricultural improvements, leading your forces to battle, creating trade routes, protecting wonders, finding relics, gathering all seven Dragon Balls et cetera et cetera.The “to do” list might intimidate new players, but AoE2 plays as smooth as butter, with easy controls and button layouts. After a few sessions and looking up a guide, you too will have a strong starting economy and empire in 15 minutes during skirmishes (campaign can be a different beast altogether).The economy is based on 5 resources: food, wood, stone, gold and population (from houses). There are multiple ways to get each resource, albeit stone and wood trading is a bit difficult with the AI since this isn’t really a game about diplomacy. Gold however can be taken from “trading” easily among two of your marketplace buildings: the further they are, the more you get.Be prepared to spew out villagers left and right and grab any rock and log you can get, since you will need them to build an army. Besides the regular soldiers, each civ has it’s own perks and a castle with a unique soldier. Some have restrictions to certain troops or upgrades, making sure each one feels and plays slightly different.All of these can be inspected neatly in the Tech Tree, available both in and out of game. You will also find an encyclopaedia about medieval battles, units, buildings, kingdoms; all sorts of neat things that old farts like myself wish were still around in modern games. It’s also worth mentioning that AoE2 HD, without any DLC, has 9 historical campaigns that are both entertaining, educational and, at times, hard as nails.If you like “easy to learn difficult to master” RTS games, absolutely get it."

It's a timeless classic that is still just as enjoyable today as the day it came out. In my opinion it is the best RTS game of all time and for that to still be true 10 years later, it is certianly worth full price.However, this is the HD version so it is slightly different. Graphics are practically the same - which is ok for such a timeless game. However it doesn't quite live up to it's HD title. However, I came back for the game - not for anything new.This HD version HDifys the gameplay rather than the graphics. It adds a new map size and increases the highest pop cap to 500 - allowing for much better games if your PC can handle it. The new map size hurts the PC more than the pop cap though and I've played 500 pop games on a laptop on the old standard map size. I don't recommend doing that with more than one player though. Nonetheless, huge armies are very fun to play with and add that little thing that we probably would've modded in. However - if this is what sold you then make sure you have a decent PC for it because it gets unbearably laggy on certian systems.Another update is the new AI which they patched in at some point. As a man who prefers to do single player, this new AI added a proper challenge to the old game when I played all the time during my childhood. I used to be able to take on  6 other AIs on the hardest difficulty all on the same team. Now I struggle against them on equal footing. However, you do have the option of playing against the original AI if you want. Even a mix if you really want. The only problem I've found with it is that it will focus on water whenever there's a significant amount of water on the map. This can be good at times but when they attempt a galley rush on highland and you walk right around them it's limitations can be quite apparent.One big flaw is it's multiplayer. They've removed the LAN function for some reason. Despite this I still play this at LAN parties but we play through the online mode. A little bit annoying. Another thing is the lag. There's a noticable lag between when you click somthing and when it notices. This did cause problems but they are working on patching these problems out. The lag still exists but I'm no longer having the problem of me putting many houses in a line and it registering the house I accidently placed rather than the ones I wanted. However, I have played an entire game which was full of unbearable lag. However, it has multiplayer (the original's doesn't work anymore) and it actually lets you try the new civillisations from the expansion packs in it.Overall, this is still the Age of Empires 2 that I loved all my life. It didn't need updating but they gave it a go and basically refreshed the experience a bit by letting me play on larger maps and with larger populations. Still the same game and therefor worth full price in my opinion. I'd personally say that the fact that the game is still being updated and you've got expansion packs if you want more, it's somthing you should get.

And then suddenly it turned out that a sequel is being released. An epic game about the skirmishes in the Middle Ages.We were absolutely crazy about it. The graphics, the colourful patterns, the unique units and the firearms first appearing in this game, were absolutely amazing. We have made our first multiplayer parties with the Age Of Empires II - Regicide game mode.And now, after fifteen years or so, a revised version has been created, incorporating additional elements from the the later editions of the game, and making improvements in the graphics, at the same time keeping the 2-D graphics.What I really like about Age of Empires, that it has always found the balance between the realism and the playability. Even if it is rather an arcade-like strategy game, it could be used also as an alternative tool about teaching history. Not to mention, it is a really great game to play with.I recommend for everyone to give a try with it. For me it will always be the number one real-time strategy game."

It is the perfect type of strategy game! There are dozens of different types of nationalities to choose from which all have their strengths and weaknesses. I have spent hours of countless fun playing this game.You can play the campaigns and when you have finished them you can play with a friend over LAN or online with random strangers! It randomly generates the maps so you don't have to worry about playing the same old map over and over.All in all I think this game is well worth the money! I give this game a 9/10!!

Buying it again in HD version is definitely not a regret. Thanks to the DLCs we are also allowed playing African races in Age of Empires II HD. Although the DLCs are bit too expensive, it's still worthy buying them, because of the nice campaigns you can play with the new races (Learning a bit more history isn't bad eh? :p). I'm not the most skillfull player in that game, but playing in Multiplayer is awesome! It is a great feeling if u destroy your online opponent with your favorite race (my all favorites are Teutons because i'm from germany). I recommend this game for every strategic lover!

After 13 years it can still be purchased (along with its expansion, The Conquerors) at Wal-Mart and Office Depot. This ""new"" title is an attempt at sprucing up one of the most beloved games of the franchise. It is amazingly rare to see an old property being brought back to life and updated, especially by a parent company that is only looking forward to the next big buck, and are willing to drop any title not making 500% profit (AOE Online was scrapped after a year in the wild, and much needed updates to many games still hang in limbo at EA). Only the bigwigs know what made them bring this one back, but we are glad to see some dust wiped off of our past every once in a while. Developer ""Hidden Path"" was contracted to shine up the series fav and bring it into the new age of gaming, they fixed important things and they didn't fiddle around where it wasn't needed, but they missed a couple of points that would have made it into a new age RTS diamond.First of all, I must thank hidden path for finally raising the unit cap, but why only 500? While it is a good 2.5x higher than before, our machines are 250x more powerful than the Pentium II 200mhz it was originally designed for. I can only guess that much of the core engine remains as it was, and 500 was the highest they could go without breaking it. Even though the cap has been raised, you can still only select 20 units at a time. Was it something that was overlooked? not likely. Here is another notch in the theory of a stretched engine. They just couldn't do more without overhauling the back end.While we are on the graphics, The reason it has HD in the title is the ability to hit 1920x1080, (and beyond for multi monitor rigs) whereas the original topped out at 1024x768. I agree with the general consensus in that the overhauled building and unit models are amazing, but once again the elderly engine comes through showing us no shadows, no zoom, and no visual effect updates. These are an almost standard feature of today's even bargain bin games that they missed completely. Does it detract from gameplay? Not really. Could they have spent a little more time bringing the graphics engine into this decade without effecting gameplay? yes.The multiplayer. What can I say here? Game Zone worked (kinda) back in the day, but thankfully we have learned from those early days and have integrated the game wholly into Steam's online network with only a few launch bugs and some early lag issues (to be continued). What this means is a front row ticket to a beautifully seamless multiplayer before-game matching experience, but completely removes the LAN option that, like me, so many young geeks had permanently set up in their basements just for this. Inclusion with the Workshop will make mod and map finding a breeze, and I believe the good outweighs the bad here, but somehow there is still a bad taste somewhere in my mind from losing our offline multiplayer. (single play is still allowed offline).The music score has been redone, but I can still pound the number keys for WOLOLOOO and ""I Need Wood"". No complaints there.All-in-all it was well worth the money, and it is the authentic Age Of Kings/Conquerors experience, but the lack of improvements to the gameplay, and the surface improvement to the graphics makes this game feel more like a decent mod than a blockbuster.(For further fiddling- the mod ""Forgotten Empires"" does everything this HD remake does, plus adds hours of single player campaigns, and a good dozen fixes)"

Now age of empires is not a bad game but it is deffiently not for everyone. Now lets dive into this review here.Single player campaignSay you dont have internet or maybe you just dont want to play online well there is a variety of levels in the single player campaign for you to enjoy from the french all the way to the aztecs the campaign is packed with hours of fun filled levels each having there own story its also a good place to start if you are new to the game its slow paced and gives you a taste of what the game is like and how it will handleartificial intelligencealthough they did update this to make it feel more like your verusing an online player it ovbiously still lacks what online players have wich is diffrent strategys and diffrent skill levels the AI in this game isnt the best and is flawed but i guess you have to make do with what you have. atleast i can say its better practice then the old AI that wouldint even get the last blacksmith upgrades in the imperial age making them a joke and very easyy to deal with. so i say if your going to do any sort of deathmatch or random map or scenario for the matter you should stick to playing with real people.Scenario EditorThis is my personal favorite of the game are you tired of online dont feel like playing aginst the crappy AI then why not make your own adventure or your own story in the scenario editor. i have had hours of countless fun making simple levels that i enjoy by myself to complex levels that are still in development this is deffiently one of the best features on Age Of Empires 2 just buying the game for this is worth it very user friendly, easy to usr and organized. the triggers take some practice to get use to but you will soon learn fast. the best part is that you can share your levels with the public and many other players can play them.multiplayerThis is where the main core of the problem is for the game multiplayer is very unstable very laggy and the community isnt to nice but its not the worst you still will find alot of decent player but ocassionaly run into the ones that always try to out do everyone or put other down. if you have much patience then you may be able to handle the lag but some game lag can just be unbarable. Dont even get me started on the dysync if there on accedent or on purpose they really know how to♥♥♥♥♥♥you off, The worst type is the player that does it intentionally because he or she is a sore loser or doesint want to lose ELO(the points that show your ranking in the game.CivalizationsThe game age of empires has a vast amount of civilizations to chose from in the game this maxumizes gameplay allowing you to tamper and play around with diffrent strategys for diffrent empires. maybe you like the ranged gunpowder of the turks or the close quarters combat of the aztecs. or maybe you like to ride the fearsome paladins of the franks into battle who knows there are many diffrent strats and builds you can try.Age Of Empires 2 OverallAge of empires is a very fun game if you can get past the  bad multiplayer lag although occasionally you come across some good lobbies that wont lag near as bad. even without multiplayer or if your preffer to play offline this game offers so much content that it takes a very long time to get bored if you chose to spend your money on the game even with its flawess i would say you would be makking a wise choice for 20 dollars i dont think you can go wrong."

Age of Empires 2 has a cult following for sure, it was a masterpiece at its time – everyone played it, I’m not going to delve into that so much as a comparison to the HD version, and if it is worth playing now.Let’s start with the HD – there is nothing HD about this.  Graphics may be polished, but it is nothing compared to AOE3 or StarCraft, or any other comparable RTS – the game still shows its age.  The AI has been improved from what I remember of the original, and several times in the single player campaigns I had to restart because I wasn’t fast enough and the AI has me in a corner.  The gameplay challenges have been welcomed and aren’t frustrating.The issues that plagued the original are still present, troop movement being one.  You have to carefully monitor your army and not send them across the map in one move.  AI movement still causes troops to get separated from the pack, or take a pretty stupid route.  The rock paper scissors mechanics are still in effect (send pikemen to horses -  swordsmen to pikemen – etc).Some other changes that the HD version brings include map size, population limit increase, and where this game is really shining – new civilizations.  The new expansions include civilizations and single player campaigns that equal the original.  They did a fantastic job of keeping the feel of the original, but adding in the different content that sets it apart.  In the mind of this reviewer, the DLCs are totally worth it.  The population increase has also been welcomed.  I tend to turtle during single player games and being able to open the gates of Mordor and flood the map is very satisfying.AOE2 at the time was the number 1 game out and became a classic.  Fan outcry brought it back full force, and I have to say it is just as enjoyable as I remember.  How much of that is nostalgia and how much is actual good game mechanics is up for debate, but I find myself pouring hours and hours back into a game, that is still around after almost 20 years.Rating: 8 out of 10.  Highly Recommended.Playing on i7-6700, 16Gb RAM, GTX1070"

The gameplay is really addictive and it is so satisfing to watch your civilization grow and dominate everyone else. Playing with other people is a lot of fun and the game compares your skill level to everyone else's so you always know whether or not it will be a far match. That's not to say the game is perfect. As satisfying as the game is when your winning, it's really depressing when your losing; all that hard working building your civilization gone to waste. The learning curve is also really steep, especially if you're unfamiliar with this genre, and getting to the level of skill that most people have online is a bit of a chore. If you can go toe to toe with a 'hardest' level COM your probably ready to play with most of the average tier players. I'd also recommend a youtube channel called 'spirit of the law' if you want any advise on how to play the different civilizations. But it's a lot of fun to learn.

One of the best games of all time.This is game is an historical classic.  One only needs to know the historical games history to know this is a fact.This game is approaching 2 decades old and has an active growing community of players. The original game was released in an era when RTS were frequently anticipated AA titles and this is one of the only games from that time period that truely stood the test of time. It has seen success over its rivals, predacessor and successors and is one of the only true contenders (along with starcraft) for greatest rts of all time. So what  makes this game so good?Age of Empires 2 is a game that is simple goal and easy to understand mechanics, many layers of complexity. This makes it a fun game for a wide variety of skil levels. At the simplest level you have a city building RTS where you expand your town and kill an enemy. This is a common setting, but age of empires 2 really perfected it. The game features a great set of single player campaigns which you follow the tales of historical figures such as Ghengis Kahn, Atilla the Hun, Jean De Arc etc.The game also features a mutliplayer which rewards players at every skil level. Beginning players may take their time to build cities and large armies. Advanced players learn different strategies to engage in early game skirmishes. This is a game where the more you give to the game  the more you get from the game.Other fun elements of the game is the game has both indepth campaign editor, easy ai scripting  and allows users to view recorded games. This allows people to create their maps, study past games and really take their time to learn the game."

I almost feel like this is because of people attacking anything negative despite reviews showing objective problems. Most of the reviews on the front page of steam that are marked ""helpful"" are hardly ""helpful"" to people who played the original given the actual problems that haven't been listed and are completely useless to people who never played the game. When you have people who will attack anything negative someone says (I have yet to see a good argument against me saying this game isn't worth 20 dollars) then crap like this (AoE:WD) happens. MS now thinks that we are blind, thrashing, monsters that will buy anything with the Age logo on it who will blot out anyone who goes against it with just flaming (not constructive critcism, flaming). Now you may be the biggest age fanboy ever and you may try AoE:WD but you probably won't put money into it. Microsoft is clearly making (what looks like) a clash of clans ripoff to milk fans that will fail (at least in milking fans) and end up being a big waste of time to any fan of age of empires 2.

MS now knows that they can charge whatever they want for each ""HD"" edition they release and at whatever state they put it in and they know people will eat it up. Even if it's broken, the criticism will be drowned out by fanboys ""downvoting"" (which is not how the system works, it goes by if the review was helpful, morons) every critical piece that comes out. You can still get the single player game with the mod for 10 dollars off amazon, with lan and fewer bugs. That is still a better value then what is here.UPDATE: IT HAS ALMOST BEEN A FULL YEAR AND THERE ARE STILL D-SYNC ISSUES AND NO SERVERS (so people are still DCing and it's still laggy as ♥♥♥♥) FIX YOUR DAMN 20 DOLLAR PIECE OF GARBAGE.-Actual ReviewI'm sorry, what is with all these reviews with their positive ratings? You guys are okay with paying 20USD for a widescreen edition and paid dlc for a game that is more than a decade old AND that has had numerious bugs even 7 months later still have not been fixed? Like the online lag is still awful. ""But it's better than it was on launch"" yes but it's still awful and at this rate I would advise just finding a copy of the original game and playing it with mods (like the Forgotten Empires, more on that soon) that run it on a modern system for the single player.As for the DLC, I have not played it, but I have heard how it had lots of bug on launch and the patch to add it in fudged up the base game as well. Buyer beware the campaign doesn't even have voice acting although on their livestream they said they [maybe?] will look for voluneteers. It's nice that they are getting paid for it but instead of releasing it for 10 (which is really unreasonable might I add) why not make it free and give some of the money you (MS) made - from the upsurdly priced 20USD - and give it to the devs of forgotten empires.Also, there are no benefits that come from the FE update, therefore, IF YOU BUY THE GAME BUT DON'T BUY FE, YOU NEED TO PLAY WITH OTHERS WHO DON'T HAVE FE OR WHO CHOSE TO NOT USE FE. THIS MEANS THAT THE COMMUNITY IS SPLIT UP EVEN MORE, GREAT, THAT MEANS ONLINE IS EVEN MORE BUTCHERED.Graphics and Performanceit's not an HD edition, it's a widescreen edition with 2 graphics options (which weren't even on launch btw) as well as no screen resolution. ""But it's an old game, why do you need graphics options?"" well that's because the game can run like crap online or offline on certain lower end machines. I run a gigabyte 7950 GPU with an intel 3770k I7 3.5 processor and the game runs like crap online, I HAVE PLAYED WITH 8 PEOPLE AND I GOT AN AVERAGE OF 15-25 FPS, THIS IS A SYSTEM THAT CAN RUN CRYSIS 3 AT ALMOST MAX AT 1080P 60FPS, THERE IS NO EXCUSE TO CHARGE ME 20 FOR A GAME THAT RUNS WORSE THAN A TRIPLE A GAME. Side note, when do you think people are gonna start saying ""But can it run AoE II HD online?The poor optimization is shockingly bad but the game is basically unchanged. Remember those graphs you would look at after a game ended that would show certain stats? Yeah those are unchanged, they look really bad now as they haven't been updated with cleaner text or anything. I would have accepted that in early the 2000s, not 2013 on an ""HD"" edition.GameplayYeah it's good. It's age of empires 2 what do you expect and from what I can tell, that's all people seem to care about and i'm assuming that is the only reason people are giving this game good reviews.But guys, THIS IS NOT WORTH 20USD AND TO BE MARKETED AT AN HD EDITION WITH THIS CRAPPY PERFORMANCE AND BAD ONLINE IS NOT ACCEPTABLE. IT HAS BEEN 7 MONTHS AND THERE ARE STILL MANY BUGS AND ONLINE IS STILL BROKEN.I will be fair right now with the gameplay, the campaigns take time to beat and they are challenging. The gameplay had a satisfacation in the way it was made that - to me, for the longest time - beat other games. Units wouldn't get stuck from time to time via collision on an object when you moved them, (Star Wars: Empire at War) units move when you tell them to without fail (company of heoes one had moments where they would just sit there) and they would respond quickly (age of empires 3, although many units behaved like that, many would move slow as balls). The core gameplay is enjoyable at least to a fan of the original but there are many outdated mechanics that I really don't have the time to go into, just think of starcraft 1 to starcraft 2 MECHANICALLY Ie unit binding, macros, replay systems, all that and how much of a leap back it feels going from starcraft 2 back to 1 after awhile of playing 2. The difference is very noticable.Conclusion:On sale at like 5 bucks, if you don't want to bother digging up the original game and putting mods (which isn't very difficult) than yeah, maybe buy it. But at 20 USD with an expansion at 10 more? No, just no. For that price you can get Starcraft 2 for a few bucks more on Amazon. Age of Empires 2 was my favorite RTS of all time until I played Starcraft 2 (warcraft 3/frozone throne came in third) but now after playing Age 2 again, I like warcraft 3/FT better. WHICH YOU CAN BUY COMPLETE FOR 20 DOLLARS, IT IS A MUCH BETTER VALUE THAN THIS RIGHT NOW AND THE MULTIPLAYER (although it has its problems after recent patches) DOESN'T HAVE LAG ON EVERY GAME YOU TRY TO PLAY.Yes, Age of Empires 2 is a good game but the HD edition is a disgrace. Don't praise this game just because it plays like the original. Don't charge 20USD for a re-release with bugs. Fix your game and make it look better and then I will reccommend it for almost anyone but at this point ONLY BUY IF IT'S ON SALE FOR 5USD OR LESS AND YOU ARE A FAN. Newcomers will get almost no value out of this instead of getting the original with mods.If this was just an intended re-release for 5 bucks or 10 with workshop and multiplayer I would be singing a different tune."

It came to me in demo form from my older brother, the demo disk had this, homeworld 1, some online game which i never played cos my computer was never connected to the internet, and a hoverboard racing game. All demos. Oh boy, the amount of times i played the William Wallace campaign, i even used to just stare at the cool looking Paladins in the scenario editor screen. Time passed, tried Homeworld and that one hoverboard games demos. Eventually somehow got Age of Empires 1, cant remember how, but i do remember playing the hell out of it.Years passed, was homeschooled and had to keep moving, so i didnt really have much in the way of friends, but at the age of 7 or 8 my older brother got Age of Empires 2 and the Expansion pack, letting me install it and use it.I played that, and pretty much only that for... well atleast till i was 11, i had memorized all the nations, the stats of most of the units, and had fought hundreds of single player skirmish games (rarely had internet, and when i did i wasnt allowed to waste the small amount of data we had on online games), fought every faction, played every faction, tried every stratagy i could dream of.Then i got a PS2 for my birthday and half a dozen games for it. Still played AOE on and off, but not nearly as much as i used to.Couple years passed, found my old disk, and started playing again on and off.The next year i got a new laptop for christmas, one that didnt overheat every half an hour when playing 3d games.Even then i still played.4-5 years passed and here i am, thousands of hours under my belt but i still play, and find it as challenging and fun as ever, hell, even recently got into Multiplayer.Now, personal nostalgia aside, this next section is if you should get THIS version of AOE 2, there being other HD refits of this particular game. Voobly for instance has one which i hear is reasonably good (havent tried it myself).The thing about this particular version is that it updates, but the devs arent exactly... competent enough that each update doesnt break something or other. Hell, for years this has been a buggy, laggy mess from what i have heard, having only got this last year. Recently it has reached some form of functionality, your PC wont catch on fire if you try to use the higher pop limits or the new map size, and multiplayer now works mostly as intended.The DLC's... well, they have their own review sections.Overall, not a whole lot has changed to the base game, new map size, HD resolutions (dont try in 4k, it doesnt work too well) better AI and some rebalances.And for the new player i think i will write a seperate guide and link it, as explaining everything about this game would turn this into a massive text wall...In conclusion, i think the devs of this HD edition could have done a better job overall, i personally hope someone will pick this game or the Genie Engine (what this game is built on) and build a new game with some more features, deformable terrain for instance would allow for more sources of gold and stone lategame and allow for artificial moats.So yeah, i do recommend this game, weather or not you get this particular iteration is up to you.A true 10/10 game, 6/10 devs."

You can't just upload a map you made, you can create all you want and it will be saved, but no way to normally upload it and make it compatible to the workshop.  You have to create folders , move files and all that stuff to publish a scenario on the workshop. The devs present and advertize it as a fully integrated workshop feature while it isn't.The rest of the game is a thumbs up for sure, but what is added to the HD version (workshop) works amateurisch at best."

There are about 10 campaigns in the base game which are all very well made. Each DLC has 3 campaign and about 5 extra civilisations, they're worth it if you like the game. There is good steam workshop support for maps and textures. Multiplayer is good with friends which is what I spent most of my time on with this game.However, there is a large learning curve to the game. You will be rushed in most online games if you can't set up quickly. Multiplayer can occasionally be a bit laggy, but is usually okay after recent patches.I'd recommend using guides etc. and playing skirmishes or campaigns until you learn how to play, this will make the online much more enjoyable.

,Recommended,221380,30052597,Posted: 19 February,all,Silas Abhi,"Blast from the PastAge of Empires II: HD EditionAge of Empires II is often considered to be the pioneer of modern strategy games. But does this old gem still holds out in the sea of other similar titles? Let’s find out:Gameplay:Age of Empires II is a medieval themed strategy game which focuses on building your own empire and then demolishing that of the enemies. The Base game contains two set of campaigns, The Conquerors and The Age of Kings. Both of these campaigns then contain subsequent campaigns based on historical leaders and events which span six missions each and tell the stories of people like Genghis Khan and Attila the Hun and their conquests.What is great is the fact that Microsoft has released three expansion packs which include new missions and civilizations. While the new expansions don’t have the same quality as the base game, they still provide new content for an all time classic.Age of Empires II starts you off in the Dark ages where you are little more than a band of villagers with a town centre to start off. From here on you are tasked with collecting resources and explore the map while subsequently growing your army.From a mere tribe you build up a mighty civilization that will stand till the Imperial ages. You need to collect food, wood, stone and gold to upgrade and build your soldiers, guard towers, castles and other buildings. While the gameplay is less complex and simpler to get into than more modern titles, it is surprisingly deep once you get to know it.Normal Soldiers will be slaughtered while trying to get through walls so you need to bring in the siege to take those pesky walls down. Your archers will get mauled by cavalry so you need to have a row of pikemen in the front to defend them and also see the enemy’s army composition to build your own. It is not a game where an early rush strategies work but you will have to keep up with your enemy’s progress.Except a few visual improvements, the HD edition includes multiplayer and steam workshop support. The multiplayer is not perfect though and there is a certain noticeable lag between command and act which might easily ruin a game. Multiplayer games also have a tendency to desync quite often and crash the game.But there is an impressive amount of people who are online for such on old title and while the expansions split in the population when they first came out, the game has been balanced perfectly for the non expansion owners to play easily with the ones that do own the expansions. The non owners are limited to a rotating pool of civs to choose from which changes every day or so. This way non owners don’t feel like they are being left out and the expansion owners can use the civilizations of their liking.What is the godsend for the HD edition is the workshop support. There are already an impressive number of awesome mods and most of them come with multiplayer support. They range from Lord of the Rings to Game of thrones Overhauls and there is a mod called CBA which I have already wasted hundreds of hours in multiplayer.There are a good lot of bugs present in the game and there are days where the multiplayer lobbies are completely bugged but the overall it still remains one of the best strategy games ever.VisualsVisually, the HD edition does not differ much from the old versions. The water and fire textures are nicer and the game has a more compact look but that is about it. That does not mean the game looks bad. Time has taken a toll on it but it still is really good to look at.SoundOne word: Epic. Right from the menu, you will sense that you’re in for a treat here. The game has an awesome soundtrack which fits right in with the medieval themes. The voice acting while limited is done very well and conveys the emotions it tries to. I can even go as far as to say that this might be the best soundtrack I’ve ever listened to in a strategy game.OverallAge of Empires II is still one of the finest strategy games ever made and it has stood the test of time. It is easy to get into for new people while rewarding the veterans. I have played the game since the time it came out and HD edition only adds to it. The multiplayer support is good and the mods will keep you occupied for a long long time to come.It will be a injustice to provide this game with a rating as it has come far beyond that. Age of Empires II: HD Edition is easily worth your time and money and if you somehow still haven’t played, please do. You won’t regret it.This review was brought to you by SIlas Reviews.

Most of the units are quite generic across the various Civs until you get to certain age within the game.The game plays like most standard RTSs, where building the right things and managing your defences and resources is key.I tried a skirmish on standard against the AI and got my butt handed to me. I put it on easiest and it was a walk in the park. So unfortunately the AI is a bit ropey. Also you can't have different AI levels for more players, they all have to be the same. This is a bit restrictive if you are trying to setup an even game with friends.Still it is worth the money and you should get loads of playability out of it. I personally think the original game was over rated, and the online version under rated, but I am one voice in the crowd there..."

,Recommended,221380,19924121,"Posted: 24 December, 2015",all,Nyara♥,"Review Aimed to New Players: Yes, it is an old game. Yes, even with the HD enchance the graphics aren't that great. Does it plays as it looks? Nope. While it is indeed an old game, AoEII was known for being so modern in its mechanics that it revolutionized the whole RTS scene to the point that newer games tried to be like AoEII and not the inverse. Considering this, you can see features such like pathfinding, balanced civilizations, mass stack of units, group controls, up to date hotkeys and a myriad of other things common in the RTS of our days. So yes, it is an old game, but it does not play like an old game.What makes AoEII so good compared to RTS of its time or present time?- The game is forgiving in small errors because confrontations are focused in tactical endurance and slow advance rather a clash of sweeping offensives. This is one of the few games where when you can truly say ""I may have lost this battle, but not the war!"". So things are more aimed toward who makes more errors (and the importance of those errors) rather about who makes the first error and dies. This add a lot of depth, playability and strategy to the game, both for newbies and veterans.- You have a myriad of civilizations who specialize in different things and each one posses an unique unit (or some, two). Yet, the bonuses and differences between civilizations aren't sharp, so aside a few particular cases you won't find yourself in the situtation that a civ. pick (or random) can determine the whole match or even influence too badly on it. The civilizations are properly balanced, so you can pick favorite ones and be sure you will rock on it as long you use their advantages wisely (and patches their weaknesses).- The game is extremely friendly to new people since it includes one of the most memorable tutorial campaigns (featuring William Wallace!) ever made, making sure in a fun and quick way that players can manage the game. While it can take a time to learn about all the units and specific details, since the game only possess four ages and the units upgrades are straightforward, a player can plan an (effective) tactic without much knowledge. The matches can be played on Slow Mode so the reaction and reflect factors of the RTS doesn't hit them hard. There are maps like Black Forest that are easy to wall, thus winning you time to compensate differences in skill levels.- The Single-Player posses a heck a lot of content with a myriad of different campaigns and random maps. The campaigns (excepts those from the expansion The Forgotten) features an amazing voice acting that will enchance your experience greatly. Wanna learn about medieval history (specially for school/college LOL)? This game and its campaigns will teach you and motivate you like nothing else you can find in your way!With that said, the game possess a flaw for new players in multiplayer and it is the resource gathering. Actually your capacity to quickly collect resources possess a snowball effect that can put you ahead several minutes (even half an hour!) of your opponent in development, giving an easy win to those who can make a lot of resources in the Early and Middle game. This is easy to improve with some practice, tips or tutorials, and resource gathering is actual fun here with the ever useful villagers (that also rocks as offensive and defensive machines since they can repair key units and position holding building during battle, just like making new main bases or frontline bases to battle). Yet, this can be frustrasting at first when someone wins you only because they handle the resource gathering better.Nonetheless, this game rulz and I totally recommend it, not only for old and veteran fans, but for new people as well!"

The gameplay is very simple and allows for a variety of approaches. There are also many modes for multiplayer and the maps are generated randomly, resulting in unparalleled replay value.The single-player campaigns are well designed and challenging. Plus, you can learn some History by completing them – I know I did.The scenario editor is a fantastic tool. It has pretty much keptAge of Empires IIalive for all these years, thanks to its brilliant and passionate community.There are some issues, of course. For example, the A.I. leaves a little to be desired and unit pathfinding is not so great, which is made worse by occasional framerate drops during multiplayer matches.Still, none of these issues are enough to keep you from fully enjoying the game.

With scores of new and unseen units in the scenario editor, brand new civillizations, and some of the most interesting random maps I've seen, this expansion is well worth the money.Overall, I highly recommend Age of Empires II HD to veterans of the game, as it will be an amazing and unforgettable nostalgia trip.

,Recommended,221380,26233348,"Posted: 26 October, 2016",all,Tommy The Jerk,"I very tentatively recommend this.""How can you say that?"" you might ask, knowing full well that Age of Empires 2 is an excellent game that is widely praised and regarded as a classic. Well, I'll explain.Age of Empires 2, as a game, is a classic RTS game where you manage a Medieval Civilization, going from a tiny settlement to a sprawling empire. If you don't get invaded first that is. There is a massive focus on combat in this game, most games are decided on the battlefield, with players fielding massive armies against each other to knock out buildings, defences and eventually innocent civilians. But of course, these armies don't come out of nothing, you need to build up some money, gather food, collect wood for buildings and stone for castles. If you aren't familiar with Age of Empires 2, I suggest you look for reviews of that game.Age of Empires 2 HD is a little different, and not always in a good way.The upgrades from the original are primarily on the graphical side of things, the updating to a modern lobby-based multiplayer, better mod support and two expansions not originally made for the game. Make no mistake, these aren't all what they're cracked up to be and there's a few problems in this release.As far as graphics are concerned, the game looks as nice as ever, with only the water reflections, the larger resolutions (which aren't easily adjustable) and a few changed in-game graphics, most of which are welcome additions. To call it HD is perhaps a stretch, but it is graphically superior to its original counterpart.The modern lobby-based multiplayer is a welcome feature, theoretically allowing for easy and simple online play, without the need for third party clients like Voobly and Gameranger. In practice, the lobby system is very suspect to bugs, with crashes upon game launches occuring frequently and dropouts that halt the game halfway through happening somewhat less frequently. For all the unreliability in Voobly and Gameranger that this system could do away with, it is in many ways inferior, with these problems ocurring less often in either client.Another couple of things that Voobly and Gameranger players would be able to avoid is the problems that actually happen in-game. Path-finding was never stellar in the original game, but many claim that it has been significantly degraded in this version. Not to mention that the actual game seems to typically run slower, with more log and with more connection problems than it does in Voobly and Gameranger under similar conditions.The mod support is nice, but the amount of content for AoE2 that isn't on the Steam Workshop is gigantic, which leaves mostly classic and popular scenarios as well as an assortment of other bits and bobs to choose from. Your typical AoE2 player won't be missing out on much, but for those who want really specific things, they might have a hard time to get a hold of them.And lastly, there's the two expansions. Opinion is divided about these; some say that the new African Kingdoms are extremely powerful, to the point of possibly being imbalanced. And The Forgotten Empires is perceived as being a slew of rather lacking civilizations that don't boast much power, but seem to have very little place in the game. Personally, I think that the African Kingdoms expansion adds a lot to the game and is very fun to play with, even if the new civilizations, particularly the Portugeuse can seem a little tough to play against. As for the Forgotten Empires, it's fun in much the same way, but the civilizations added seem too timid to really add all that much beyond a few interesting unique units and techs to open up a few more strategies than there used to be.The bugs that make online play well under optimal for such a multiplayer focused game, not to mention one so old and a few of the gameplay problems make me really hesitate to recommend AoE2 HD, because these issues are extremely frustrating and can feel like a dealbreaker. But when the game works, it's as fun as the old AoE2 and sometimes even more so with the higher resolutions, the extra content and the new community. I can't blame you if these bugs get the better of you and you end up going back to Voobly though."

Originally released 14 years ago during the golden age of Microsoft Game Studios with classics such as Halo, Rise of Nations, Dungeon Siege, Fable etc. Age of Empires II might be the most acclaimed RTS game of all time, with exceptions of maybe Starcraft and Warcraft due to the importance they had in the competetive scene compared to Age of Empires. Age of Empires never were a real successful tournament title but there has always been small communities surviving throughout the years.The original game is still available in some Retail stores as ""classic"" branded title, often as a third-party release. I bought a DVD copy a few years ago just for the sake of nostalgia, it featured both the 1997 original Age of Empires and the sequel for 9,99€. Yet I instant-purchased AOE2HD when it arrived on Steam. I would've bought it even if it costed me 29,99€ for the sake of getting it on Steam with workshop support, achievements and higher resolutions.The HD version does not include Any high-definition textures or effects, as one might expect. The game is rather a High resolution edition, supporting up to multi-monitor resolutions, not that it's recommended on a Strategy game, but still neat. Some people argue that the price is too high and the title is false marketing since the game does not feature any HD changes to the textures. Combine that with the amount of issues some people had upon relaese - and you get quite a few disappointed customers.This game introduced me to Video Games, Age of Empires (1997) was the first game I ever played, at least that's what I remember. The sequel did play an even bigger role throughout my childhood and even up to this date. A supreme LAN title to play with your friends or on your High-schools computer's. No doubt this is the game I have played the most ever. Which does say quite a lot, I regularly return to play some Single or Multiplayer.Age of Empires II HD recently recieved it's first expansion - The Forgotten. Which adds 5 new Civilizations, 4 new campaigns, a bunch of more units and upgrades, new custom maps and settings. This is probably what fans wanted with the original HD release, since the expansion costs 9,99€ alone. I am still extremely excited for new official content after such a long time!If you do not have a personal connection to this game then I suggest checking out some videos and maybe look out for a sale. If I were to install the game from my DVD and gotten the fan created high-res support as well as server hosting service (Voobly, GameRanger), then if I would've tried to play online - I would have gotten my♥♥♥♥♥kicked. This revival resulted in a lot of beginners started playing this game again, which is a very good thing. I get to kick some♥♥♥♥♥without being a total ""AOE2 Master"". We've seen a lot of classics being revived lately, and I hope publishers and devlopers realise what kind of money a person is ready to spend just to feel like a kid again.Like Real Time Strategy and don't mind a few dated looks? This game suits you like a glove. Maybe you just want it for the nostalgia?"

,Recommended,221380,14326475,"Posted: 4 February, 2015",all,Dark_Knight<Arpit>,"Firstly it is a great thing seeing one of my favourite RTS games appearing on steam, as it has given rebirth to AOE2 after many years. Though I first played this game when I was 12 yrs old i.e some 4-5 years back(not a long time). Though I don't have many play hours on my steam account but I can say with a 100% guarantee that I've played this game for more than 500+ hours with the old disc version.Secondly, as the title says ""Age of Empires II:The HD Edition"", I will only say that its no worth buying if you're buying it for some improved graphics as it has only some minor(0.01%) graphics change(or say texture change) only on reflections of water and the colour of cliffs. Other than that its just the old AOE2.But the good thing is that it has multiplayer which is no dead and you can easily find a decent amount of people playing online.In short here are the pros & cons of this version of game-PROS-1.Multiplayer reborned2.Buy this if want to remember some good old memories of this game(having it on steam)3.For new players I would say you should try playing this best classic RTS game if you want to.4.Some minor changes like--Select more than 40 units in a row(not sure how much, maybe 50 or 60)-Supports a maximum of 500 population limit in standard game mode.CONS-1.Don't buy if you're concerned only with the HD graphics.2.Its no remastered edition, its just an old AOE2 with steam workshop and steam trading cards available. But yes it has multiplayer to play.I really don't mind its graphics as I am fine with its old retro style graphics. But they should have improved its graphics as it says ""HD Edition"" which it is not :CFinally, I'm happy that it is on steam, and also the developers are releasing new contents for this game."
,Recommended,221380,9442018,"Posted: 12 March, 2014",all,ownosourus,"Those of you that haven’t played AoE II in a while will probably have some pretty fond memories of the aging strategy title. You’ll likely think of it as one of the greats; spectacularly innovative, well-balanced and displaying a level of detail that would make Renaissance painters blush. Then … you’ll start the game.As great as it might be, the number of changes that have been made here are the absolute bare minimum. There are no HD textures, all of the original sound effects and voice clips have been kept, and none of the mechanics have changed. Everything is exactly as we all left it -- for better or worse.Little in AoE II has aged as well as one might hope. Those used to more sophisticated strategy games might find this golden oldie a bit frustrating. There’s no auto-explore, no unit command queues, no building queues, selecting a group of units will often select stray workers, control groups are pretty limited both in terms of number of units you can select and number of control groups allowed, and worker AI leaves quite a bit to be desired.Even so, there’s a kind of purity to the whole thing. Micromanagement and care are a lot more important than they have been in years and the lack of affordances and hand-holding gives a rougher but sometimes more precise experience. I found myself setting rally points much more effectively, and I would often dedicate five of my control groups to villagers or workers specifically to help cycle through economic management. For example, in my main lumber-gathering camps, I’d keep one worker in a control group so I could easily reposition the camp, and jump to that group of workers for quick action.Additionally, I became much more careful with base construction patterns and the arrangement of my buildings and supply lines. Keeping everything organized with so little help from the computer is hard enough, and I figured working around my own foolish base design would make the whole thing intolerable.This bare-bones approach encourages a much more aggressive, and obsessive style of play. There’s no room for complacency; you can't afford to stop moving or quit paying attention. Quite unlike StarCraft, which is often the same for the first three minutes or so of every match -- build worker after worker, secure more food, then crank out some military. At the very least, AoE will have you manually scouting and switching between various starting food sources while also securing housing, wood supplies, and getting everything set-up for the tech advancement. It’s different enough each time that it’s never the same game twice.Each of the civilizations is also fairly balanced with a few small exceptions here and there. Generally speaking though, the game is a very appropriate gauge of an enormous number of tactical as well as bigger-strategy skills. The game moves fast enough with other competent players that you’ll need to be pretty aggressive to keep up, without being so inaccessible that newer or less well-practiced players will be doomed before they ever start.Similarly, the campaign will take you through some of the more interesting, albeit distressing, moments in the middle ages. It’s all more or less historically accurate, though handled with a fair amount of tact, such that it never veers into unnecessarily offensive territory. If you can teach your children how to play effectively, it’s honestly not a bad tool to teach them a few things about major historical conflicts. I remember learning about the Aztecs and the city of Tenochtitlan from this thing. Enough that I can still spell that city-name properly with one try. Whoever said games weren’t effective teachers?In all seriousness though, this game is fantastically well-made, even if it a little rough around the edges. Some of the bigger issues with trying to run the thing on modern computers (such as the color bug, and the mouse scroll bug) have been fixed. Plus AoE II now supports a huge range of monitor resolutions, which is nice, even if we’re still stuck with these old textures, but there is Steam Workshop support so things could change down the line by fans.All told, while a little frustrating if you’re not into tons of micro-management, Age of Empires II HD with the Workshop and updated multiplayer features is an excellent title. The brilliance of the game’s design is still there, you just might need to look past its age to see it."

The use of triggers is extensive and some are either/or so if you choose path A path B is not available.I've really enjoyed playing this game again and the new campaigns are so much better than previous.  I already know I will revisit these campaigns.
,Recommended,221380,30239679,Posted: 28 February,all,Excalibur,"So 35 hours into the game, I guess it is time for a review.The game is addictive as a whole, playing against the AI is challenging itself, more challenging than playing against other players, single player is therefore very competitive and fun to play. Taking the AI on higher difficulty head on is a suicide mission and will result in your army dying out. It requires strategy and quick thinking.Eg: The Persians were attacking my front base and taking them head on was not an option, I stationed my archers at the walls and directed infantry and cavalry to a forest where I used an Onager to clear a path, of course I walled it up later. I sent my troops through that path and flanked the enemy only then was I able to repel the attackers.As you can see, the game at times will make you try out unconventional strategies and methods and these are the moments that you will enjoy.The single player campaigns are fun to play aswell and are very informative and historically accurate to a certain extent. (The Scotts lost the Battle of Falkirk) Campaigns are worth playing.Multiplayer is fun but the community is quite toxic and not very welcoming to new comers. So it is advised that you learn your stuff before going into multiplayer cause you will be pressed down hard.Though I do experience a funny thing in multiplayer. While I may be lagging in AOE 2, at the same time when I quit AOE 2 and launch AOE 3 multiplayer, I don't experience any; I suspect it is ESO at play.The modding community and official updates of the game are alive and regular so that is not an issue.Even at full price the game is worth it and you get a whole bunch of content to play around with.I recommend this game highly and a must add for your library.8/10"

,Recommended,221380,12568272,"Posted: 19 October, 2014",all,Phlum,"You can't really call yourself an RTS fan without playing this masterpiece of the genre first. It may seem a bit basic - train a load of soldiers and build a load of siege engines in order to systematically remove every other player from the map - but the complexity comes from adapting to various different styles of map, as well as learning how each different civilisation works. For example, the Britons have some of the best archery units in the game, but their mounted units are lacking in response. On the other hand, the Teutons have a unique unit that can take a lot of hits but is extremely slow, so they essentially need ranged escorts. And then there's dealing with being krushed (a.k.a. rushed with knights) and being able to reach the Castle Age in under 20 minutes. Oh, and don't even get me started on the absolutely wonderful soundtrack - something that I didn't hear until I got this version, no thanks to having to use a No-CD patch.However, while this is an incredible game, I feel like Microsoft haven't done enough to call this a true HD edition. Yes, technically it is in HD and this improves the game significantly, but otherwise it has little in the way of improvements, and it's therefore quite expensive for what it is. If you're never going to play multiplayer then try to find it cheaper on Amazon or something, and download the Forgotten Empires mod separately. Otherwise, get it when it's on sale, because fifteen quid is rather a lot of money to be spending on a game that's over 15 years old.In conclusion, absolutely get this game (when it's cheap) because it is one of the greatest strategy games ever created, alongside Civilization IV and Command & Conquer: Red Alert. And to those idiot critics who say the game doesn't play very well, you deserve several slaps."

Many people recommended this game and when I saw it on sale I gave it a shot.Basically, this game is like European Wars : Cossacks. Old style RTS.The only downside to this Age of Empires 3 versus the second is the way you can choose formations in the second. It felt overall the second had more to control whereas the third sort of simplified things and tried to make the game easier and smoother. AoE 2 is your typical RPG, offering peasants (or settlers), militias, markets, church's, walls and gates to protect your city.

,Recommended,221380,16015204,"Posted: 26 May, 2015",all,Lance Corporal Boiled Egg,"Well, a couple of days ago I bought Age of Empires II on Steam, because I have so many fond memories of playing it as a kid. The thing that got me worried though was that I wasn't sure whether I would still enjoy it now...I couldn't have been more wrong!Man I used to play this game on my crappy old laptop, it was so much fun! I remember making whole maps with oceans and forests, then starting from the dark ages with a few villagers to make it to the imperial age whilst fighting off armies of intruders from the inky blackness of the unexplored regions. It really is a fun game to play and here are some of the reasons why:1) There are so many customisation possibilities, you can make almost any scenario imaginable (well, as long as they are historical ones). There is a fully customisable map editor, where you can build anything from natural landscapes to villages and cities. In this editor you can also change the game type (conquest, king of the hill etc.) and the enemies you face (including their civilisation, eg. the vikings). There are up to seven AI controlled players to either battle with, or even form alliances and trade.2) The mixture of building an thriving economy, amassing a formidable army and furthering your civilisation with loads of technologies to research (which differ between civilisations), makes gameplay rewarding and addictive. There is nothing better than watching your civilisation grow and prosper from a tiny group of villagers with a town centre into an amazing city, producing forces to bring your enemies to their knees!3) There is a great campaign mode that is both fun and challenging. The campaigns are split up into different historical events (for example, the tutorial features the Scottish battles against Edward Longshanks' English forces) and feature figures such as Joan of Arc and Atilla the Hun. It's surprising how much detail has gone into these campaigns when it so easy to make your own games; there are fully voiced introductions to each of the missions, and numerous objectives and optional missions to complete each time.4) With the introduction of the title onto Steam, there has been a complete revamp of the online features. There is a whole community of players with which to battle and ally yourself with (admittedly I haven't tried the online features yet, but they do look promising). Steam has also introduced achievements and trading cards to the game, which can only make things better right? However one of the best things about moving onto steam though is the fact that there are so many mods available! (right now I have a mod that includes Arnold Schwarzeneggar taunts to my sound list)My one gripe with the game is something that I believe has been many peoples' concerns since the game was first released back in 1999; the AI can be pretty awkward sometimes. This usually comes through when your army runs off without you noticing to pursue a single enemy scout, only to be slaughtered when they reach the enemy stronghold. Or you build an amazing empire to realise that the enemy hasn't built a single thing... they have just chopped down every tree on the map (why this happened I have no idea).The one thing I will say about this is that the AI on the new steam version is updated (and so are the graphics, huzzah!) and doesn't seem as silly as before, and there are updates still coming. All in all though, I think that this game is completely worth your time and money, and will keep you entertained for hours, so grab a copy or download it from steam, you won't regret it!The Fox Eyed Man's Rating: 8.5/10"

I've deposited countless hours into this game growing up and played local-multiplayer with my sister every day. In later years we used GameRanger to play multiplayer verses other players, even though it wasn't super ideal.In my opinion, Age Of Empires is one of the greatest RTS games to date... even though I play very few RTS games, the ones I have played pale in comparison. AOE II has a deep upgrading and leveling system per game and a very large varity of tribes to choose from, each offering their own special units. You can play on a variety of maps and gamemodes, including ones you can create in the map editor. This is where the Steam workship really comes into play, easily being able to download custom maps in minutes.The map editor itself is something I could talk about for a long time because it is so advanced. I'll keep it short though and say that under it's surface are the options to create detailed and custom campaign scenarios or maps with custom triggers and plenty of props. If you have the time to invest into the map editor, there are no limites to what you can create.Age Of Empires II holds up really well for being 15 years old, and if you love any kind of RTS game, Age Of Empires II HD without a doubt should be in your collection. The new expansion packs they added is also a must have, adding new features, maps, and units while keeping it true to the origonal game."

Text below.What is age of empires?Age of empires is a classic real time stragery game. In Age of empires you are the wel.. hmmi think you are the king of a little kingdom. You always start of with three or four villagers and one scoutYour main goal is to defeat the enemy king which also has a village somewhere out there on the mapYou'll need to issue orders to your villagers and get them to work, villagers gather resourcessuch as stone, wood, gold and foodYou don't need to literally feed your people, but if you wish to recruit more villagers you will need tospend a one time payment to start the creation of a villager which will then be recruited.As you gather supplies you will become able to build various buildings such as the barracks, archery rangeand stable. All the buildings require a certain amount of supplies in order for you to build themfor your kingdom.which are all used to recruit a certain type of unit. The blacksmith is in turn used to upgradevarious aspects of your units such as armor, line of sight and firing range.As you play you develop your own village or perhaps should i say kingdom. You will become powerful andeventually lose or win the game by defeating the enemy king or getting defeated by the enemy king.Once you have acquired a good base of supplies you may head over to your town center and advance to the next age.Once you advanced to the next age, new buildings will be unlocked.It might seem easy but it definitely is not. The ai is what i call the typical AI. The first moment it stands idly by,while it attacks with everything and everyone a moment later. Even though the AOE II HD development teamworked on the AI i still find the AI rather vanilla with it's behaviour not greatly enhanced.I did notice that the AI actually sends siege weapons in and archers for targets that infantry can't reachbut the AI has a habit of sending it's unit's one by one to their death.You can age-up a couple of times. You start at the foot age and then age up to the feadul age.After the feudal age comes the castle age and the last age would be the imperial age.Everytime you wish to age-up you will need to possess a certain amount of goodsto pay your age-up with. Once you reach the castle age you will unlock siege weapons which couldbe essential for takingdown castle's and other fortified buildings.and we've got a perfect example right here right now. As you can see the AI has various units just standingthere doing nothing.They are literally waiting to get attacked or for an enemy to get close enough to them.It usually takes a while for the AI to actually start attacking you, but when it does it does attack you good.As you could have guessed, i do am playing on the easyest difficulty right now.civilizations and upgradesAs you play you unlock new upgrades everytime your civilization advanced age.Once you build the proper building, let's say a library.. many new upgrades will be unlocked and made available for researchYou could for example then research stronger armor, sharper arrow, longer range, faster units andnew attach methods etc.At the end of the game you will still be able to view the good old timeline. Showing the stats of all players who participatedin the game. You can view military stats, economy stats, technology stats the society stats and of course the general timeline.There are various civilizations a player can pick to play as.Each civilization got it's own bonus. Be it cheaper units, faster unit recruitment, unique buildings and so on..what is new?The game has been released again under the name of age of empires 2 HD.However, there hasn't honestly been anything new despite the steam workshop and the steam multiplayer function.The textures do look indeed much sharper than they used to do.But then again they still exist out of visible pixels.The expansion pack they brought really didn't bring much to the game and is to be more of a mod.Luckily there are active members in the steam community wish dedicate their time working on mods and new content.There do is some new fancy music which i actually liked instantly. It literally settles the mood properly and brought me backinto the good old age of empires II atmosphere.There also are a couple of achievement a player could earn for defeating players and acquiring certain achievement.But other than that? No, there isn't much new.Steam workshop integrationOne of the amazing things the developers added is the steam workshop integration.This allows steam users to access new content such as textures but also new or additional units!And if you are creative, you may contribute to the community yourself.I find this a very good new addition myself, this way the AOE developers no longer need to release new content for the game.Now, the community could do it for them!multiplayerit is amazing that you can now play age of empires ii online and on steam without having to port forward your router.But it still got it's flaws. Even though you're using a network and are no longer usingtelephone line to play multiplayer the game still suffers from constant performance dropsand internet delays which only occur at multiplayer games.Final verdictThe game is good, it is still good. It's lovely how the online option and steam workshop was added. That surely brings thegame back to life.However, the game itself hasn't changed. So if you're planning to purchase the game again for the single-player whilst havingit on an old disk somewherethen do not purchase it, the game is the same. It's the online and workshop you should purchase the game for."

Alternatives to this exist as freeware in the form of ports such as Voobly.No Manual way of changing resolutionSteam overlay often bugs during the stats screen and after a game in the main menu.Despite all of this, it is still the Aoe we all know and love, with some modern conveniences. So, yes I would definatly recommend this game to anyone remotely intrested in true RTS gaming, in a world were old school RTS games are ridicilously difficult to find.RATING: 68/100 (Good)Most of that mark is because it is AOE2 with multiplayer that actually works. However the lazy nature of this 'HD Remake' must be taken into consideration to anyone wishing to purchase it. Value for money is not very high, at 27 euro one can purchase other Remakes such as RIse of the triad or Serious sam HD, but at the same time Aoe2 fans like myself are not likely to turn down this offer.EDIT 2016:Much of what I said earlier still stands however the state of the game is much more polished and the addition of the expansions as well as the balancing accompanying them have made it a far more enjoyable experience, at least to me. Stability has increased dramitically with it being able to run at an uncapped FPS without issues.If I were to give it an ambigious rating, it would increase to around 75 as really the easy of access and the community they have created here is well worth the price of admission."

Both are definitely worth getting.The game is still recieving developer attention, although progress has been addmittedly very slow and patchy.  Neverthless, things are slowly moving in the right direction; bugs are gradually being fixed and in general the experience is improving.  It's certainly playable at the moment although plenty of people whine in the Forums about all kinds of diverse issues.So, in conclusion:If you liked the original Age of Empires II, you are in for the same experience here, except that the game is now once again being supported by Microsoft.  It is not a modern game with fancy graphics, it is an old classic that been reinvigorated with new life.The standard price for the game seems rather steep to me, so I would definitely recommend waiting for a sale to get it."

Oddly, there is a ""fix"" that is so buried in the discussion boards that it took me multiple searches since March 2014 until now (December 2014) to find it and revert the AI to the original and more perfected Age of Empires II AI. When you select Single Player, each ally/enemy has an arrow list that says ""Computer."" Click on it and change it to ""The Conquerors AI,"" and finally, you can play the game without issue. I cannot stress enough: the new AI is a broken mess, and this game would NOT be worth it if it weren't for this option. I am giving the HD version a ""recommended"" because it does, in fact, have an easy and accessible fix to its greatest flaw.Now, on to my original review.This is one of the best strategy games of all time, and my personal favorite. Despite already having a hard copy of this, I wanted to support it through Steam as well. For those of you who have this game already but were looking for the differences in the original and Steam version, here are some pros and cons I've seen thus far:Pros:-As an owner of the game on Steam, you have access to the DLC that was recently released (The Forgotten Expansion), that you wouldn't have access to with the hard copy.-This has an active community that uploads mods, taunts, maps, and more through the Steam Workshop.-Some of the HD upgrades (the water, for example, which has waves that move unlike the original) add nice flair.Cons:-Many people who have bought the game are experiencing glitches or lag of some sort. Though most claim to experience lag, I have yet to see this myself.-I have personally seen the negative side to the reworking of the original AI. If you play single player against CPU opponents, be prepared to be underwhelmed with your allies and downright confused by your enemies. For my first skirmish, my AI allies did nothing but collect resources and create a handful (less than 10 in every case) of combat units. This is compared to the disc version, where CPU allies would create massive armies to aid you in completely demolishing enemies. Further AI problems include building up armies just to hold them at a standstill for an hour plus of in-game time, ally AI armies standing in the midst of MY town center to where selecting my units was impossible (due to a multitude of their units blocking my way), units that simply stop doing ANYthing, where you either must overwhelm them with numbers or win via non-combat means, and the enemy AI straight-up gaining resources that do not exist (AKA cheating; this is also an issue discussed in the forums) on moderate difficulty or above. Basically, the game's AI is completely broken, but this CAN be fixed by the workaround I listed in the first paragraph of the review.-On another note, the CPU allies are not nearly as responsive as in the original version. I am well versed in the keyboard shortcuts for commands (telling your allies to wait to attack, for example, or build a navy), and unfortunately, they're just not listening to me half of the time in-game. (UPDATE 12/8/2014: This can ALSO be fixed by using the game's original AI with the fix above.)-Some of the HD changes this version made aren't as good as the original. The cliffs look awkward and two dimensional, for one example, and prepare to relearn the resource bar (the food icon that used to be a steak is now an ear of corn, etc.). HOWEVER, you can download mods to change this back to the original if you are unable to get used to it.-Just one look at the community hub for this game will show you that the developers can't be bothered about the community's main concerns. Some frivilous questions/concerns are answered, but the main concerns such as the downgrading of the AI have been unanswered for months (I originally wrote this review in March 2014, and as of December 2014, this is still true).Main Verdict: Age of Empires II is a must have for any RTS fan or gamer with an affection for medieval warfare and weaponry. While the HD version does have its setbacks in comparison to the original version, there are fixes to ensure you have the classic AoE II experience. Age of Empires II HD is a good alternative to the original game for those gamers who do not have a physical copy or have issues running it. Age of Empires II is a solid 10/10, while Age of Empires II HD earns a 9/10 because it has the fix available. If it did not or they were to take the option away in the future, this score would need to be downgraded to a 3/10."

Totally recommended!"
,Recommended,221380,17533910,"Posted: 14 August, 2015",all,Xpliciit,"IntroductionFirst of all i just want to say that i played this game way back in the day when it was released and i loved it so much. Back then you had no way of tracking how much time you played but il bet anybody i played over 1000 hours eaaaaasy! Then when the expansion disc came out i just had to have it omg i was so addicted back then.So now that im 25 years old and probably hadn't touched this game for over 10 years, i see that this game is on Steam and for Nostalgia reasons i decide what the hell i loved it back then i can love it again on Steam!ReviewSince this game has been released on Steam the developers have included the Conquerors expansion disk (DLC) with the original game and also included Workshop support. It was due to this Workshop support that the modding community for this game created such a vast epic amount of content that the Developers had decided to even release further DLC to this game that i believe was created by the community. However since i bought the game on Steam after this point for me it has always had all the DLC included.So playing this game again for the first time in probably over 10 years brings back so many memories and im soon remembering how i used to build my bases and quickly picking up the hotkey buildings. With this i jump straight into a couple of Deathmatches and Random matches against the NEW Computer AI which is considerably harder than the disk versions Conquerors AI. I get killed off pretty early and quite easily but im not phased at all because the memories playing this game are flooding back to me and im absoloutly loving playing this game once again.Unlike the PS2 version this is Steam and therefore it also now has achievements of which there are around 300 i believe, so if you are wanting those then there will be no using cheatcodes like back in the day when you were a little low on a resource :PAlso one thing i will add since having bought this game it has very regularly been Updated with many Stability fixes and Lag fixes. Due to the age that this game is now considering it was first released in '99 the support from the Devs is just fantastic especially when they could just ignore this game and focus on their much newer games. Speaking of which i also have AoE 3 but haven't played it on Steam yet, it doesn't seem to have Achievements or Workshop content like this game does for some reason so maybe that doesn't get the same support this game does i don't know, either way if you are looking at buying an Age of Empires game i highly recommend you buy this one!MultiplayerSo this game since being released on Steam has Multiplayer - Something which i at least never had on my PS2 version although we never had an Ethernet cable to connect to it back then so maybe there was Multiplayer back then too. I personally have not yet even managed to touch on the Multiplayer side of things since im progressivly working my way through completing all the Campaigns in the entire game and its DLC. Multiplayer i can only imagine would even more so greatly increase the overall number of hours played in this game, especially when you look at playing through some of the Workshop Scenarios together too.WorkshopSo this game has Workshop content, what does that mean? It means that the Developers have given the AoE community the power to create thier own graphical texture improvements and share their scenarios that they have created for this game with everyone else that owns the game.For me so far i have grabbed a couple of graphics improvements that give the water textures a more colourful, realistic feel and new cliff and grass textures. This gives the game a whole fresh, modern HD feel to the game which still has or at least looks like it has the original graphics from 1999. That is what im assuming from still having not played the disc version that i still have with the PS2 :PThere are like i said before many hundreds of Custom Scenarios all created by the Community Workshop that i haven't even touched on myself yet that could add upto hundreds of hours of extra gameplay. I have seen scenario remakes of Lord of the Rings and Game of Thrones to challenging scenarios and some other very creative scenarios!There are graphical mods that allow you to completely change the entire feel of the game so you can have Crystal Trees and huge Veins of Gold and Stone Mines with a Space like terrain if you wanted. This is the kind of things you can experience on a game this old that breathes new life into it and could easily see you play over 10,000 hours in this game.OverallIf you played this game back in the day and loved it - BUY IT NOW! You will not regret buying this game, i only have a meagre 200 hours so far in this version, i expect to be easily dropping 1000 hours in eventually. That is ontop of what i could only guess would be at least 1000 hours on the PS2 version back in the day :P"

Age of Empires II is a classic historical RTS with rock-solid, foundational gameplay. This re-release also boasts improved AI so it's even more of a challenge, albeit I wouldn't say it approaches Starcraft-level. It won't run on computers that the original edition would function fine on due to the increased graphical load, unfortunately, but if you were planning on playing this game seriously you probably already have a good computer.If you feel like you can measure up, or if you just have nostalgia about leafing through the included encyclopedia of medieval life while desperately hacking your way through the campaigns, I'd absolutely recommend this."

,Recommended,221380,14332263,"Posted: 4 February, 2015",all,Jragghen,"Age of Empires II HD is a historical real-time strategy game where the player takes on one of a number of civilizations and builds a base using a group of resources (food, wood, stone, and gold) in order to advance technologically and amass an army to attack one (or multiple) enemy bases, who are attempting to do the same to you.I played the demo endlessly when I was a kid, but never had the opportunity to play the full game. Having come back to it now, mechanically, the game is actually still solid, and individual games can be very pleasant - quick pick-up games are still good. However, when playing strategy games, I prefer to play through the campaign (if one is provided), and this is what I've found difficulty with. A large number of the missions rely overly on already knowing what the map's layout is - knowing where an enemy is based so you can immediately send a surgical strike to take care of someone before they grow too large so you can grow in peace, knowing where fortifications are, etc. So rather, it's a matter of trial an error as opposed to any strategic decisions in order to beat a given level - there's nothing WRONG with this, necessarily, and it was customary at the time, but less so for modern games.Now, pick-up games where everyone starts from scratch? That's another thing altogether, and the mechanics work fine for that. I just question whether a person who was used to more modern games coming back to this one would find it much of an enjoyable experience without the nostalgia to build off of, as I don't have much myself, and I often found the game to be frustrating.Ultimately, I'd say the game is worth a look, but for people who didn't play it when it was new, you may run into a similar frustrations."

It is an amazing game and runs well on new and old machines alike (caveat: I've only played single-player and have heard about multiplayer lag issues) but it really shows its age and the HD enhancements really aren't that impressive.One big complaint of mine is that the screen is zoomed at a fixed level (I have tiny interface widgets). This was fine 10 years ago when screen sizes were pretty similar but it just doesn't work well with bigger monitors. Apparently when they called it HD edition they really meant 'works on HD monitors and newer processors without crashing' not 'graphics and interface adjusted and imrpoved for modern gamers'.

In one way this is great because it stays true to the original game for nostalgic value and so professional/competitive players won't shun the game for being ""casualized"" or ruined for minor changes. On the other hand this is a huge amount of lost potential. To be perfectly honest, Age of Empires II was a very flawed title - I mean don't get me wrong, I love the game and it was amazing when it first came out... but it hasn't aged as well as it could have. No pun intended.I still think the game is incredible and well worth the purchase, but I would have liked to see them do more than just port the game over. A more advanced map editor, better mod support, more interface options, more potential. All things that don't really affect the 'competitive' scene but give the rest of the audience (probably 99%+ of players) something to play around with.The original AoE 2 gets my full 10 out of 10 score, but this 'HD' version is just a sloppy port.$20 is a little steep to re-purchase a game that came out in '99, but hey, if you love the series then I guess it's worth it.Original Game: A+, timeless classicHD Remake: C-, could have been better"

The game shows promise, has new units, techs and civilizations and anyone can appreciate the painstaking beautiful detail with which some scenarios are designed. But somewhere in that drive to create, the creators got carried away. Very carried away.Some scenarios are almost unplayable with how difficult they are. The creators seem to have gone trigger happy with creating HUGE enemy armies and are obviously obsessed with the ""big battle"". This amateurish approach is something you'd expect from a beginner creator who wants to fill the screen with as many units as possible - not a serious creator.You'll get huge hordes of units massacring each other, armies wasted against walls and almost impregnable cities with extremely tough AI (even at the easiest difficulty levels), impregnable cities with upwards of 10 castles, endless ""Fire Towers"" and seemingly endless resources and ability to regenerate endless units. Challenging is fun, but this is just... yeah. Not worth it.The original games were charming and made you feel immersed. Sadly, the expansion's difficulty is its biggest downside. It's hard to get immersed when you feel like you are fighting an almost artificially impossible scenario every single time you play.Would not recommend."

The original game was so good, I don't even remember when I first started playing it from a DVD. I must have spent hundreds, if not thousands of hours since my first ever AoE II game. I still have my old DVD with the game.So why do you need the HD Edition? I've tried and the original still works fine on my 1080p screen, so what's the point of buying a game if you already have it? If we don't count the much better graphics, the answer is the content. With the HD edition from Steam, it adds so much more interesting possibilities.First is the Steam Workshop. You can now download for free hundreds of maps, enhanced graphics or elements or even new troops and buildings.Second, the DLCs. You can't add ""The African Kingdoms"" and ""The Forgotten"" DLCs to the original game without tinkering with the game. I prefer to pay a few dollars/euros to get it from here than trying to find it on some sketchy Reddit post.And last, but not least, the multiplayer games. Whenever I tried to go in a multiplayer server on the DVD game, I was directed to a Microsoft website that told me that they stopped supporting multiplayer battles. it is essential to try multiplayer and learn from some veterans, who know all the best tactics and some might even try to help you learn to play better.As a conclusion, this is probably one of my most favorite games and I think that you would like it as much as me."

It is a remake of Age of Empire II: The Age of King and Age of Empire II: The Conquerors expansion pack reimagined in HD and now entirely as one single game. Everybody know what Age of Empire is unless you're really new to PC gaming, the game is a legend, was the best classic real-time strategy of that time.All gameplay and features in this game is left untouched and are very exactly the same as the old Age of Empire II except for the new 500 population limit for skirmish play, let's you train even more units and having a larger battles and larger tactics than before.The graphics has been improved slightly where you can see the new water and fire textures and effects are better than before. The new widescreen support for the game are also included. The rest still retain the same graphics as before.Well, the exact same gameplay and features could be the good or bad thing, because most people don't like buying things similar with what they already have, own or taste, but if you're looking for the old Age of Empires II in a new and better way then it is for you. All the story campaign, civilization is all there and the new Steam workshop integration is the best thing so you now can download many user created content ranging from maps, scenarios, AI scripts and many more to customize your game or create your own stuff and share it with everyone in the Steam community. I say this is a good remake, I recommend this. And by the way, I've been playing this game for over 6 years :)Rating 10/10"

My only complaint is that the quick match service does not work very well, but this is a moot point if you have friends that play. All in all, a fantastic game.

Unlike the majority of the reviews, Im gonna hit the highlights throughout the game, and not focus on ""crashing multi player"" like everyone seems to have issue with.Ok, the best deal on Steam is the Age of Empires 2 HD with the DLC The Forgotten included. Ive played THOUSANDS of hours on an old disc, and have completed the majority of the original campaigns. Finally, I didn't play it much. It was just old and had lost some of that exciting thrill. But once I bought AoE2 HD with the Forgotten DLC, the game feels completely new again, as the new civilizations bring all new units, building style, campaigns, and that thrill of a new game.  Even with the original civilizations, and campaigns. This truely brings a real medieval town building experience, and it is quite easy to see people settling down somewhere, starting a town, and calling it Hungary...truely an experience to see what a medieval king had to go through.Here are the highlights I saw:Population limit increased to 500 to better build armies and navies.The new civilizations make the game feel like its an all-new game, not a updated version of an old gameThe campaigns have a more in-depth story to them in the game and in the storyClicking on the characters to make them speak and sometimes have conversations in-game is a nice idea!Campaigns are SUPER challenging on standard difficulty(the easiest difficulty to choose from)It also discourage's the use of cheat codes as NO Steam achievements are gained if ONE code is used.Being able to play online WITHOUT cheat codes for proper strategy.Music is awesomely epic!!!!!!!Things that could be good or bad, depending on your view:No voice-over during the story reading before and after campaign levels, though if you had to pause during that, it saves the story till your not busy.The multi player finding system. You just select the settings you want, it search's and you gotta hope it finds a game. If not, tough luck.Down part of the game:Game is LAGGY during multi player games cause my computer wasn't ""connected"" to my friends device and would cause lag. Felt a bit ripped off there.Lag seems to be most when population limit is 500.A dirty word in-game. Its always been so clean and family-friendly(excluding Attila the Hun campaign and now the Dracula campaign) but I never did complete the Aztec campaigns either.The price. It is ridiculous. I got it on sale during the Mid week Madness sale. But it needs to be lowered some. But you do get excellent game quality.Overall, excellent game, the battles are well balanced, unless of course you have 100 troops against 30. The 30 wont kill any of your troops, most likely. The civilizations are also well balanced, so all are strong as the other. Its up to you to maximize there power over the other and ultimately, the winner will be the best general/king/emperor ;) I'd suggest keeping multi player local until you have the grasp of the game or the lag disappears. For old, veterans, this is a whole new ballgame. For new players, buckle up for a wild ride through history!"

They've added support for larger monitors and even multiple ones which is awesome. They've added new civilizations which is also a welcome move.The new campaigns though lack the voice acting that made the original conquerors and age of kings feel more real.The developers have removed local lobby which is a HUGE drawback of this game. You always end up playing online with someone with a moderate to poor ping. The number of players that are on multiplayer is dwindling quickly down to a trickle as of Sept 2014. Given this, the lack of local multiplayer is a major drawback I hope the developers will consider re-adding into the game.I am recommending this game purely because of the potential that it has and the hope that the developers are encouraged to continue development to improve the game, build a community of followers around it. This game has future potential and is a fun game to play offline."

No sooner had they returned than a new document was faxed to their secret missions-only fax machine. Furious picked it up.""Zimmering zwounds, Agent Cobra, it's a message from the leader of the Byzantines!"" He said, flapping the page in the air.""Well, Furious my boy, what does it say?"" He was calm, nonchalant, which was odd, given the traumatic conclusion of their last adventure.

Stop. Sincerely, The Byzantine Leader'. What does it mean, Agent Cobra?""""Furious my boy, that's a cipher,"" he said, as he somehow lit a cigarette. Puffing a noxious cloud from his exhaust, he continued, ""If I'm not mistaken, it can be decrypted to mean 'Dear Cobra Car and Furious the Monkey Boy: I am aware of the dangers of requesting your assistance so often, especially given the... emotional nature of your last mission,'"" he shrugged, ""'but I fear circumstances have left me with no choice. The reasons for your new mission are confidential, I fear, but your objective is simple: the enemy king must die. Do this and you shall be rewarded.'""""You decrypted that in your head?""""Many newer cars have onboard computers...""""Well, yeah, but not for cryptog...""""We ride, Furious my boy, to slay the enemy king.""""But which enemy did he mean, Agent Cobra? There are so many. The Aztecs, the Koreans, the Malians, the Franks; how will we know which one to assassinate?""Cobra put his tire on the confused sidekick's shoulder.

I used to play it all the time before the disc broke when I was younger, and my recent return to its beauty is a warm welcome. The HD graphics ""update"" doesn't really stand out to me, as it looks nearly the exact same. However, the exact same is good enough for me. The music fits the game like a hand in a glove, and if you're one who cares as much as I do about in-game soundtracks, this is THE most memorable music I have ever heard while playing a game. It stands out with its really unique approach to the how a game should sound, and listening to the entire 30 minute long epic (and that's only the base game soundtrack) while outmaneuvering enemy players is a dream come true.The game itself still holds up extremely well in terms of variability even to this day. Its many different civilizations all offer something slightly different, both in terms of playing style and building style. The expansions for the game add on an almost ungodly amount of additional civilizations, which only furthers its flexibility. The game modes are relatively straightforward, and all very fun in their own way. My all-time favorite will forever be conquest, in which you must conquer all enemy players completely and decisively in order to win. The resource system in the game is perfectly executed, in my opinion. I believe it found just the perfect balance between simplicity and depth, as it is very simple to learn, but very difficult to master, hence the appeal from a shallow learning curve. The different branches of research are much more difficult to master, as they are plentiful and all useful in certain situations. You need to decide what is most vital at the moment, and work towards it (ex. advancing villager resource gathering speed or troop strength) while also juggling however many other tasks you can in order to keep a fluid overall movement and pace as the game progresses.The workshop implementation for this game is simply a joy to browse through, as this game was just begging for it from the start. The map creator tool in game makes it possible for custom maps to be posted and downloaded by anyone, and the more open-ended game files allow for easier modding. Right now whenever i play the game, I am treated to the game of thrones soundtrack at the title screen as a result of a simple download from the workshop. Various available texture packs caringly created by the workshop members are really nice to try out, as they can add entirely different feels to the game as you play it. Beyond this, I can't think of much more to add about it, other than the fact that it greatly furthers this game's life expectancy in my games library.Overall, I can tell you that this game, no, this MASTERPIECE, is well worth the buy, and the constant discounts it offers should only entice you further to snatch this baby up.Need I even add it? - 10/10"

I've been trying for several minutes now to come up with something brief that would summarize why this game is the best, but I find that I am unable to. There's just too much. If I were to list all of the things that I like about this game, I would basically be making a list of everything there is in the entire game, because I quite literally like EVERYTHING about this game. The map types, the game modes, the civilizations, the buildings, the units, the technologies, the unique features of each civ, the artwork (256 colors have never been used so well) and of course, the scenario editor. The quality of the mod tools is fantastic, and if you browse online, you can find thousands of great multiplayer maps, full campaigns, and even heavily triggered scenarios that play out like RPG's or adventure games. This game does not support the higher resolutions that you're probably accustomed to, but it is still a great-looking game and of course the gameplay is still as great as it ever was. Highly recommended."

When your game crashes, you don't lose any ranking at all.That being said though, this beautiful, well-crafted game only needs to maximize multiplayer security and robustness to fully ensure that every single minute you spend in multiplayer is just as good as playing the game yourself in singleplayer.The new multiplayer system in servers have changed. Now there's two types of AoE II games that can be played; Original Game (Age of Kings + The Conquerors) and the Expansions (Original Game + The Forgotten + The African Kingdoms.)Servers can now choose to either host these two AoE II games. HOWEVER, if you join an Expansions server, you are stuck to a LIMITED pool of civilizations to choose from, unless you own the Forgotten, or the African Kingdoms. I highly recommend that you buy this game in addition with at least one expansion pack in order to prevent restricted options in multiplayer; the selection pool EVEN limits Age of Kings and Age of Conquerors civs.Overall, it's a great RTS that shows historical values of the civilizations you play, providing the same, satisfying gameplay experience. However, it suffers from crashing in multiplayer games, and the fact that there's a limited pool of civilizations to choose from for people who join Expansions game servers, yet don't own any of the two expansions, hinders multiplayer experience for people who've already bought the original.My favorite number is 30lololololol."

Luckly you don't really have this problem with AoE II HD (it happens with other very good games just like Warcraft III or Empire Earth). I would say the HD graphic it's kind of ""retro-oldish""  but also ""newish"" at the same time: a perfect compromise.It's a shame they didn't add some new features, but even lacking new relevant updates this game is still amazing and can definitely compete with more recent titles.If you're wondering ""is it really worth it to spend 20dollars for such an old game?"" my answer is: you'd better wait for sales in order to get it for about 5 dollars, but man... the game is worth all the 20 damn bucks."

I wish I had Steam when I was younger because the amount of hours I spent on this game when it was released was unreal. I religiously played this game. It's also so awesome with some of the crazy♥♥♥♥♥cheats like ""how do you turn this on"" gives you a Shelby Cobra car that fires cannon balls like a machine gun. Nothing scares your opponents like 4 wheels of gunpowder madness. Cheats aside, this game is a fantastic city building RTS with an amazing tech tree and unique units to each of the different civilizations. For me it's always the Britons being an English lad of course. Nothing beats an army of 50 elite longbowmen with heated shot (fire arrows) upgrade. Also the fun part about playing a skirmish against computer opponent is the fact that they always seem to launch premature strikes on your base as like a 'provocative strategic manoeuvre', when really all they end up doing is getting completely mauled by the little army of archers/foot soldiers that you have been obtaining (alternatively they can keep sending ungodly amount of troops somehow 5 minutes into gameplay when you're just building your 3rd house and got about 3 farms up and running, and then slaughtering and griefing your tiny little village). Regardless of that nonsense, when you've fortified your city with walls and built 7 billion castles around the edges with a couple of watch towers dotted in between, you can safely start to build your mahoosive army which you then take on one massive campaign and dominate the AIs. Alternatively, if you're a sh-i-te commander then you'll have to end up going out with an army and getting them all slaughtered and then having to spend out resources and building another one. On the bright side there are achievements on Steam for getting your own units killed (such an incentive I know!). There are awesome formation settings and attack stances that separate you (an organised battle tactician) from the computer AI (naked blue body painted savages that throw all of their units and resources away).It's always so awesome looking at the end of scenario report and seeing your stats sky rocket above the rest of the players.As for online, I've never played online so find that out for yourself.Buy this game immediately because of reasons and because of a unit called a Petard (I know right) that you train in a castle and it's basically a medieval suicide bomber.20/10 - love this game"
76561198006650820,Recommended,221380,12256724,"Posted: 27 September, 2014",all,btrdtoast,Definitely a classic RTS. The Age of Empires series is what got me into strategy games and what got me into history actually. Age of Empires II offered a better variety to the strategy of how you can build your empire and take on multiple opponents. Although I did like the third entry to the series this one will alwas have a special place in my heart. Having played it for hundreds of hours (although you won't see that listed on Steam) I always find my self coming back to this game all these years later. Building up a fortresss (especially on the island maps) and setting out to conquer whatever opponents you face is very satisfying. If only Age of Empires III had the map sizes that this game had I would say it would be a close competitor but nothing beats the classics.

Champions and ballista's.so i sent a lot of Paladins (full tech tree option) to counter his Champions and to quickly eliminate the ballista's. And he sends Halberdiers!I loved this constant thinking of what to counter but your enemy always being one step ahead of you!then i made my own map!I loved making fortress maps for me to defend againts the AI in AOE 2. but the strategy that the enemy uses is really hard to comprehend in this kind of situation.I always turn off the Trebuchets because I flipping hate those things. and then the enemy comes to the gate of my grand city! with siege rams, lots and lots of siege rams. so i send my Kamayuks outside to deal with them. and you'll probably guess what was in the rams.... Arbalests and Champions... he countered my Kamayuks just because I went scouting with one earlyer in the match.This game has it all. HD graphics, great campaign, great AI, lots of options and a sense of nostalgia..thank you Microsoft Studios (and all the other companies that I don't see just because I want to skip the video's in the begin and play my game)you made one of my favorite games come to life again.11/10 it's awesome!"

,Recommended,221380,8319550,"Posted: 26 December, 2013",all,Andy,"Age of Empires II is disputably the greatest RTS game ever made. The sheer variety of maps, units, technologies, and playable civilizations make it a force of its own, but the game attains premier status with its incredible map/scenario making tool, a killer campaign, well-balanced gameplay, and generous catering to multiple play-styles. Age of Empires II: HD Edition is not a remake, but merely a rerelease with a few changes, including widescreen support. Neverthless, the release was long overdue, and it is the one of the games I am most happy to have in my Steam collection. Disclaimer: this review is also for ""The Forgotten"" expansion pack.The Good:* Incredibly huge game with near-perfect gameplay and virtually timeless game mechanics. Many features of newer games are a tad hard to replicate, such as auto-explore,(hold shift to create waypoints then click on your map all over), but the game othwerise stands up to the test of time quite well.* Units, when grouped together, create tactical formations to your specifications. AOE2 was the first game to do this, and no game has yet done it so well as AOE2.* Greatly expanded and updated multiplayer options, including the treaty mode which gives a huge advantage for ""turtle"" players, a population limit of up to 500, and automatic ELO online rankings.* Steam Workshop support with active modding community, including HD texture packs.The Bad:* Online multiplayer has noticeable but acceptable lag.* The achievements are WALLS of text that do not fit into Steam's mouse-over UI when checking on achievement progress. Here is an example of one of the longer achievements: ""Over one hundred of your units were lost in this battle - even with such great losses, if they were well used against the enemy you did the right thing. Get used to studying the battle stats after each match with an opponent - did you have the right complementary mix of units? Did you make your enemy pay for every one of your losses? Every unit sacrificed is an opportunity to learn about your opponent.""* I encountered a potentially serious bug where everyone's name switched to ""[unknown]"" and we all had to navigate by player-color. Chatting was very difficult.* The game is not FULLY steam compatible. The F12 key, which should take screenshots for Steam, loads the ""save game"" menu. This makes taking in-game screen-shots an annoyance.* No ""military drag"" feature, which allows you to select a group of units EXCEPT for villagers. This was first introduced in AOE3.The Ugly:* The game had a horribly messy launch which gave many people a bad first impression. Most bugs and glitches have since been fixed.The verdict:* This is a must-buy for anyone who enjoyed the game when it was still in its hey-day. If you have not played it before, you may consider waiting until it is on sale (it is on sale for the worthy price of $14.99 at the time of this writing)."

Every new patch introduces a few new bugs and further diminishes the quality of the game.

The games are plagued by lag and constantly go out of sync. There is zero quality control with this dev team. They are now pushing out more DLC instead of fixing core features that have been broken by an incompetent team of developers.

76561198005636407,Recommended,221380,8082479,"Posted: 17 December, 2013",all,Meneldil,"The trailer states that Age of Empires II defined an age. Well, in my case, it's actually quite true. Even more so than Total Annihilation (that I was offered at the same time), AoK is among my favorite RTS games. The fact that I was already an History nerd probably helped, but the game was nonetheless a very slick RTS.The gameplay was very basic - peasants gather resources and build stuff before you go to war -, but everything was very well done, and it implemented a lot of cool mechanics, like garrisoning units inside castles.Overall, let's say I have very fond memories of AoK: I loved the single player campaigns - despite the WTFHISTORY moments - and playing it in LAN with my brother and friends.That being said, do I recommend this HD edition? It's hard to say. The game is still as good as it was and, unlike Empire Earth 1 & 2 and their somewhat basic 3D, AoK graphics aged pretty well. But, as far as HD goes, it's pretty much inexistant. Thank god, you can have a decent, recent resolution. Thank god, you don't have to use some computering shenaningans to make it work on Windows 7. Apart from that... There's the steam workshop, which is nice, even though there is, so far, not a lot of content on it, map and scenario-wise. There's apparently some remade water HDish texture (didn't notice it). There are some new bugs, and some old ones haven't been fixed...All in all, I find the price tag to be set way too high for such an old game, with so little apparent update. 19€ + expansion is overpriced. Too bad Age of Empires II is still a great game, because if you liked it back in the 2000's, or want to try this classic, the HD version is as good as you'll get. And is regularly updated. So, my final piece of advice is: wait for a sale and get it (*). It's unlikely you will regret it.* Unless you're rich, in which case, go ahead and buy it now. Then send me a check."

,Recommended,221380,14039758,"Posted: 17 January, 2015",all,Dayeneth,"This Game is truly a history in the making. The Age of Empires Franchise is outstanding being the start of the Strategy Genre. AOE 2 really made its toll as a game as now it's been remastered, it really can't get any better. What makes this game so good is a number of things. To start of the gameplay is great. There is a key manging that you have to do to achieve a large army, a stable amount of resources and golden tunnel to victory. It does not match the Mangement of CIV 5 but there's a big difference with both of the games (but lets not go into that). The Graphics may not match most other strategy games like Company of Heores 2 and StarCraft but I think that's what makes it an AOE game in it's own sense. With the huge armies and big variations of units fighting this game really makes combat fun. When playing this game like most strategies you have to think carefully and plan your road ahead, you will come to do this alot with AOE2. Plan who to attack, plan what you are going to do with your first villagers so it requires alot of thinking but theres no harm in that.You have the choice also to pick a huge variety of factions to play. Each faction is unique in its self for example: the Byzantines to having a STRONG♥♥♥♥♥Cavlary Unit, Heavy Armoured with a fast speed. But also having certain strengths and weaknesses and the Celts having Woad Radiers a strong brute type unit being swift and having high attack. Like the factions the units in the game have strengths and weaknesses. Enough about the units and Factions lets now talk about the music. The Music is catchy, you won't get bored of the music. The music is very fitting and is great to listen to.What Makes AOE as a series is the Map Maker. There is a wide variety in making a may, from adding lots of different types of terrian to buildings and units. You can make your own campaign if you really wanted. The REAL Campaign Personally was alright, I enjoyed it but not enough to say it was AMAZING like the game itself. One of the things that really I enjoy about this game is the expression of custom battles and Skirmishes. You can have Skirmishes with Friends or Solo and the map will always be randomly generated. You can choose many different map types to choose from but also the premade maps from the Steam Workshop.The Steam Workshop really increases the games overall score. The original AOE2 is outstanding but the Steam Workshop allows you to add maps, new units, OUTSTANDING new Textues and custom music as well, but also many other things.Now Moving on to DLC ""The Forgotten"" the only ever DLC released for this game enchaces the game to a point. It adds new units, factions, campaign missions and other things. Personally I love AOE2, but the DLC is not worth the money. So I do not recommend buying this DLC.Overall this game is truly amazing, I recommend buying it but not its DLC. You will never get bored of this game as a game is always different even if you play the same faction and use the same plan. I really want a AOE4, AOE 3 is amazing but thats a another review for another day.This game scores a 87/100 from Captain Fidgett - ""A Truly Fantastic Game with its great gameplay, map maker and a game you can't get bored at"""

After that theConquerorsexpansion was released, which almost everyone who has the original Age of Empires II also got. The game is one of the most popular RTS games in existence. It's most fun when played in multiplayer, my friends at college and I love playing multiplayers games all crowded together in one dorm room. Trouble is, we can't play over the summer because the online support for it was dropped years ago (it is an old game). A lot of us were disappointed by this fact, and Microsoft must've found out, because they modified the game to work with Steam's multiplayer system and re-released.What's new and improved in the Steam version of the game:-Slightly updated graphics; almost everything looks exactly the same or identical to the old version, except for the water, which looks a lot better in the new version; the old game looked good (2D graphics), so no change is good here (but the new water is nice)-New resolutions are supported, along with dual monitors (the old game only supported 1280x1024, 1024x768, and 800x600)-There is a new AI, thanks to a recent game update (recent as of 6/29/14)-The max population cap was move from 200 to 500, you can still limit it to all the old settings if you want-All multiplayer works through Steam nowWhat is not so good in the Steam version-The game requires a much better computer to play than the old one; this is actually very obnoxious, the graphics really are not much improved (except the water, of course), but it takes a lot more graphics muscle (yes, not just CPU) to play it smoothly-Multiplayer is rather laggy, almost every game I've played has had a very unpleasant amount of lag; for this reason, if you are not a big fan of the game, you should not get it unless you want to play the campaigns and single player battles (which are still fun); I still play multiplayer almost exclusively, but I really like this game, so that's why-LAN multiplayer isn't an option now; I would hope that it still uses only the LAN when all players are on the local network, but I don't know; however, while I say this is a bad thing, it hasn't actually caused a problem for meApart from what I mentioned above, the game is pretty much exactly like the old game. You can play it with no change in gameplay if you like, by setting the pop cap to 200 or less, and you can even choose to play agains the old AI. The game plays like the 1.0c update of the originalAge of Empires II: The Conquerors.

This is the type of game you don't really have to put too much effort into for me is a game you can just relax on and its even better playing with friends. Yes I would recommend it but I don't think its worth the price. I would wait for it to drop to about £7-£8"

There are many RTS games out there, some simple, some complex, but none have the same majesty of Age of Empires 2; Age of mythology was a good game, as was AOE 3, but none are just so simple, yet so complex as AOE2 that they can warrant the same price tag in today’s standards.Regarding actual gameplay, it can be said that the graphics look a tad dated, but personally i think it plays to the games strengths, the idle animations are rather quaint, and the sounds as well as the ambiance is all very satisfying; this truly is one game where an hour feels like five minutes, and ""one more game"" becomes the ""one more turn"" curse which has afflicted civilisation in the past!Definitely worth a buy if you; like history; have a penchant for RTS; just want a good game!Wolololo!!"

The epicness began and the difficulties were increased. The new features to this game are awesome and the multiplayer works very well. There are still a few bugs, but they are minor. ALSO, keep in mind that this game and many of its mechanics, are from many, many years ago. That being said this game is completely worth paying the whole price for (make sure to get the expansion as well) and its a no brainer to grab when its on sale.

It will make you build your economy dexterously and assemble your army ealier in the match next time. The graphics are applealing to the eye, even in the 1999 version. A perfect balence of colors and lighting make the game what it is. Each civilization is unique by having their own units and upgrades. They are all balenced, so you can not defeat another player by rushing your civilization's only special units.

Like this one, the AOE 2 HD. It`s the sequel, and in HD?! I know, it`s the same, but with more detail graphics. So what, it`s the same, it`s original, and i have to say, it`s one of the best Strategy Classic & Medieval games i ever played. This game like any other game, have his problems/mistakes, but in other way, it`s so cool with this saga that continues, and you can do what ever you wanted, cause have the creative mode and all that, have multiplayer, SP, you want trading cards for this game? Have it to, you want more? This game have also a DLC, that contains more civilizations, new game modes and etc. Conclusion, It`s a great game for real. And if you want more and liked this one.. What you waiting for? They have the next Age of Empires, the next sequel, Age of Empires 3! ;) So i recommend for shure this game! Have Fun!"

I still have my disks to AoE1,2 and 3, so only bought this verison when it went on sale with the additional campaigns, and I have to say it was worth it.Now, If you are looking for soemthing completely new, or an updated UI, or massively improved graphics, no, you are not going to be pleased.  However, there were tweaks in many areas, one being that unit selection seems to have been boosted, there are now options much higher unit caps allowed, and the water doesn't turn a splotchy purple and the grass a red speckled blur on my monitor, as the original version does.  Pathing for units has also been changed... but that's a mixed bag.  Sometimes better, sometimes they hang up an entire battalion on one lone tree.As for the new campaigns, I'd say they're as good as the old.  Definitely a challenge (though that might be artific of  not having played them a dozen times, as I have Ghegis Khan, Barbarrossa, Joan of Arc, and the Aztecs) with the new factions being fairly interesting.If you go into it expecting the same game, merely updated to be playable on a modern machine, you'll definitely be getting what you want.  If you are doing it for the nostalgia... wait for a sale, or you'll probably feel you overpayed.  And, again, I'd definitely suggest getting the 'Forgotten' campaings, too."

I wanted to love the game that was my child hood and play it again with my friends. What I didn't have in mind was the fact that the resolution cannot be changed and can only be different depending on your monitor size. For me, there has been no way to change this. I played the old regular Age of Empires 2 and I was able to set my resolution so that the Town Center only took up 1/10 of my screen. Now the new version(apparently), the Town Center takes up 1/4 of my screen and it makes it really hard for me to play. Yes, the new add ons and the features of gameplay are awesome, but being able to even play, let alone play singleplayer without the game absolutely bugging out fps wise, the game is unplayable. On multiplayer, the game will have a 2 second delay lagg at all times and this makes it really hard to micro. I can't say this game isn't fun, because it is, especially with everything new and all, but all these problems overpower the new stuff which makes the game unplayable and not fun. I still recommend this game but it seems to me this problem will persist and I will never enjoy the 1920x1080 Age of Empires I always loved."

Yes that is true you can play your own maps via Steam multiplayer and the graphics are much improved! Weird thing is I have run into some lag with playing with larger populations.. Not sure why, my computer is a monster. I could have bought like a few 2 month long relationships for the price of this beast! Anyway... I don't know why I get a stutter but it does happen.Other than that, which doesn't happen on my friend's PC, I'd say its a perfect update to the old AoE, and there really isn't an RTS that can beat AoE 2, except maybe Company Of Heroes 1 (NOT 2!!! 2 is a ♥♥♥♥ing item mall scam and they developers should be burned alive.) Getting off track again.. Like I was saying (#2) It is great to have AoE2 back. It's a solid game from the old school library. There have been many repeats but only one stays true, AoE2. Rhyme not intended.I say buy it, especially if on sale. It's a classic. Multiplayer works again. Graphics function and look great (For 2D diablo-esk graphics) are very well done.

76561198069869314,Recommended,221380,9536289,"Posted: 17 March, 2014",all,Gorlaran,"GREATER POINTSBeing one of the first computer games I've ever been priviledged to play (its predecessor probably being the first), Age of Empires II, even after more than ten years, continues to amaze me. Whether you're raising vast armies to bring your civilization to victory (no doubt with the support of a population enhancement mod), or if you pride yourself on creating the most impenetrable city/fortress known to Medieval man, this game fully supports your input with multiple ways to play, varying maps and map-types, and a near-full arsenal of weapons at your kingly disposal. The 'Forgotten' expansion/DLC brings in even more variety with new civilizations (and hence, new unique units), larger map options, and additional campaigns to follow historically-based figures from their rise to (more often than not) fall. The HD edition itself, although, holds its own quite nicely when the expansion is unavailable.POORER POINTSBeing a ten-year-old game means it certainly shows its age (especially to someone new to the franchise) with 2-D frame-based figures on a mock 3-D map (which several mods on the workshop can significantly improve), outdated AI (which there are mods to replace and improve the AI, even on the workshop), and a slight lack of cultural accuracy (such as the fact that all military units and villagers look the same across all civilizations, form the Britons to the Japanese. No mods I know of currently fix this). No, it's not as militarily-geared as, say, the Total War series or as economically- or culturally-geared as the Civilization series. The HD Edition does little more than increase the default resolution, provide more company labels before the out-of-game menu shows, replace the old water tiles with ""moving"" tiles that simulate waves and the reflection of sunlight that shines in the wrong direction with accordance to all of the building shadows (a mod in the workshop helps fix this), and make the software more compatible with up-to-date PCs.SUMMARYOverall, this is a great starting game for someone not only interested in the Age of Empires franchise (whereas the first game has several lacking mechanics such as land-based trade, detailed troop formations, overpowered units such as the 'Centurions' with 'Priest' support often spammed by the AI, et cetera), but also for someone wanting to introduce themselves to the strategy genre. Even for someone experienced in both categories is Age of Empires II: HD Edition worth taking at the least a look at. Truthfully, I can say that of the three real-time strategies of Ensemble Studios' Age of Empires series (and sadly it doesn't look as if we'll get any more) this one easily takes the lead. Whether that's my nostalgia or the truth speaking, I'll let you find out yourself.Thank you for your time."

It's challenging and spontaneous and if I win I feel a grand sense of accomplishment and pride, knowing that I did it myself without the game's help. When I lose I don't give up until it's truly over, even if I have to seek refuge in the forest on a far corner of the map with my few remaining villagers and one man-at-arms to defend them, slowly rebuilding my once-great civilization. This game is unbelievably well-balanced - each civilization in the game has its own ups and downs but ultimately it is the player that causes his/her own victory. You can build great fortifications of walls and towers around your city, creating an enormous and impenetrable stronghold. You can chop down an entire forest and manage fifty farms and ten mines, stimulating an economy that will allow you to recover rapidly from countless battles, which will in turn let you slowly weaken your opponents through unrelenting raids. You can act peaceful while amassing a secret army of knights, battering rams, archers, cavalry, and petards (self-destructing bomb guys), then blitzkrieg straight through the middle of somebody's village, destroying houses and mills not because you need to but because you want to, and then when all is said and done tear down every last castle and town center within their walls. You can take an island for yourself and create a perimeter of walls and guard towers along the shore, then defend it with a diverse navy of flamethrower boats and massive warships, occasionally sending a small force of twenty galleons to harass your enemies into submission. You can accumulate enough resources to construct and defend a structure of such greatness that your civilization will eventually be recognized as the ultimate empire, claiming victory by sheer impressiveness. You can have your city study smithing and academics so that despite having the smallest army you may still pose the greatest threat to your enemies. You can BUILD A GREAT WALL. You can practice devout faith in your God, so much so that the soldiers of your enemies will convert and join alongside you in your quest which is truly the most righteous. And if none of that appeals then you can always just say ♥♥♥♥ it and go out with a bang. The possibilities are limitless in this game.Pros:+you can do virtually whatever you want to succeed+lots of civilizations to choose from with unique technology trees+many difficulty levels for AI if you have no friends+a bunch of story arcs if you want to do something more than just battle (why would you?)+five ways to end a match that I can think of off the top of my head - there are probably more+infinite ways to reach those five ways+custom map maker+you control everything+you can commit genocide and not feel bad about it+great tutorial that nobody ever plays+funny accents in the storylines+many different gamemodes and map styles+wololoCons:-in the Crusades storyline you have to play as the Saracens-moving around the map is weird at first-playing against people who are really aggresive in the first 10 minutes (my brother) is really annoying if it happens to you (every single time)Neutral:=old graphics may bother you if you're a baby who's never played games on a potato before"

I remember being shown this game at a friends house when I was a teenager, and I was immediately captivated by the medieval setting. I would spend hours in the Scenario maker designing my own medieval lands and the online games I played with my friends were so fun we would talk about it the day after at school. I couldn't wait to get home and play AOE2, again!I played AOE3 a bit and AOM quit extensively, the latter being a very good game in it's own right, but there's just something about AOE2 that resonates something deep inside me to this day. I didn't know about the HD remake until last year, and when I found it I had to get the game, again! The graphics still hold up, and with hundreds of community mods in the workshop the game has a lot of appeal to almost anyone out there. I'm impressed with the amount of attention Creative Assembly have poured into the game, most notably the new expansions and added units and civilizations, new maps and map sizes, the game really feels twice as much more than it did in the past.The only thing that irks me about the game, and has done so since day one, are the vast array of units that every civilization shares. There are a few unique units that each civilization has all to their own, but it's still a little off putting seeing an army of European man-at-arms being recruited from a Japanese barracks or swarming the jungles of the Aztecs and Mayans. But that's what AOE2 has always been about, I suppose. It's a small complaint and doesn't take away at all of the true core gaming experience. And with the aforementioned community mods available, a lot of fine folks have alleviated this problem, a bit.If you're a huge fan of medieval gaming, you may want to check this one out. If you enjoy real time strategy games, well this is one of the most classic examples of the genre and you would be doing yourself a disservice if you passed AOE2 up.If you can stomach the price for a 17 year old game, it is worth it, but if you're patient enough to wait for it to go on sale it would truly be a steal. It would be most worthwhile to purchase all of the added expansions as well to get the full AOE2 experience. I waited until the Summer Sale because I wanted to also purchase it for my girlfriend, who I am trying to get into the game and although she really doesn't play any games whatsoever, she can't resist just how damn fun this one is, especially playing online, together.Online is a whole other story. Personally I haven't dabbled too much into online with people I didn't know, as my skills aren't quite up to par to the general level. But I'm starting to be a little more brave and I really don't mind getting my butt handed to me as it's quite a learning experience and still much fun to be had, as long as it doesn't happen too often!So long story short, if you haven't heard of this game before, get out from under that rock you've been living under and experience one of the most timeless, funnest, most in depth games ever created. And for those who have played the original before but felt they've grown out of it, well be prepared to spend more countless hours falling in love with it all over again, as I have!"

Just like in the game Cossaks, it is a waste of time to stop during a battle and create farms. Please make an infinite button for farms and units! It is also annoying in the dark and feudal age to always keep an eye on the towncenter to keep it constantly making villagers... People would like to play, explore, battle as much as possible and not make villagers and farms so often and unorganized. It is only a waste of our time if we have the resosurces anyway. Not being able to have an INFINTE BUTTON to make a building create continously a certain unit, seems like one of the oldest problems of AOE still not being solved and we can not understand why. Especially when the (selection of many barracks + adding units to que with Shift button spreads the que to all of them) bug was solved. However this is not solved very well also, as it should work like this: if u select 5 barracks and want to make 10 pikemen, and u order with shift key, the que should add 2 pikemen in que for every barrack so u r more time efficinent. Thank you for reading and please share this with the guys who work at the patches for this wonderful game. Also i congraduate everyone for doing such a great job with it as it is now anyways!"

Unlike most popular RTS games from Blizzard, which emphasizes more on micromanagement or the hero than macro and only requires harvesting two different types of resources, in the Age of Empires series, one has to deal with four types of resources and there are different ways of acquiring them. In Blizzard RTS games one sees combat with their opponent much sooner whereas in Age of Empires I & II, the average timing for the first tier occurs roughly at about 12-13 minutes, 15-16 minutes for the second tier, and roughly around 28-30 minutes for the third. This really depends on whether or not the player rushes or booms.This series stands out simply because each map type is unique so players are expected to be more alert and adapt to their situation, where Blizzard's games have the exact same map.In AoE2, there are 13 civilizations, each with it's own unique characteristics, hence build order. To be good at RM or DM, you will need to know, not only the build order for that civlization, but how to counter the strengths and exploit weaknesses against your opponents civilization.There are limitations to the HD version on steam in that the game lobby is still based on the original concept and the player statistics aren't well recorded. However, one can simply download the compatibility patch to play onVoobly.comwhich offers a more competitive environment and more!"

,Recommended,221380,28578327,"Posted: 23 December, 2016",all,Orpheolus,"This game was once released back in the late 90's, while I was a bit too young to really appreciate it when it first came out, I eventually got it as one of those Wal-mart packages for $10 that came with AoE I and II. After playing it for ~100 hours or so while growing up, the pc I was using began to bite the dust while playing the old AoE II (came with conqurors) messing up many things including the textures on the ground. I was saddened for a while...Until I discovered it was on steam for $20 (got it while it was on sale for $5) and began to enjoy it all over again. I can say that when I first got it (HD rerelease) the AI plus the music overhaul were to be getting used to. I continued to play it a bit more until I had enough to afford the first dlc, then any other new dlc were bought within a week of release.Gameplay wise, it is a classic. While the online battles are more than challenging, the bot battles are also enjoyable. You gather resources to boost your township up, building buildings and troops to beat any foes. The basic premise of the game is very simple to understand and yet difficult to master. For some games can last mere minutes if they know what they are doing vs Hours. Not only that but most civilizations are unique in their playstyle, not the cookie cutter others might have.Cons, while it might say HD, the graphics are not the crisp and clean ultra 4k resolution many people have come to expect in many modern games more being a graphical slight upgrade on the textures. Also the AI goes through phases. Before the recent patch/dlc the AI was a little dull but the recent patch really put me on my toes.The community, as far as I am aware, is very welcoming to any new novices wanting to learn the ins and outs of the game. A great community is what really makes a multiplayer experience stand out. So if you want to expand your knowledge, the community is willing to help out.This game has withstood the test of time. Comparing the other Age of Empires games, AoE 2 still gets updates nearly 20 years later. VERY few games can have that honor of support for such a long time. A cult classic that still gets updates. 10/10 would experience nostalgia again... BRB going to get more nostalgia!"

It has all the goodness of the original plus a little more.  There is not much else to say, if you have played the original you likely know what is good about this game.  If you have not, then you may not want to bother.The ""HD"" part of this is not really all that accurate.  It seems the graphics all not all that enchanced, not in any way that really matters.  Though, it is still nice to see some better graphics."

,Recommended,221380,28067912,"Posted: 29 November, 2016",all,Joe da Immortal,"In 1999, on this dinosaur of a computer, I played Age of Empires 2 for the first time.Back then, I was four years old and not the best player, but enjoyed real time strategy games the most. I would do things like make the female villagers get berries, lambs, and farm, and make the males woodcut, get gold, stone, and occasionally mix them up if I thought some of them were getting lonely. Now I realise how much of a waste of time that was, but it's still funny to look back on, and some say there were hidden buffs with those villagers' genders, so maybe I wasn't all wrong.There's a lot of little nuances that are impressive that many modern games do not take into account. Things like having a defensive boost at the top of a hill, or recreating a civilization from a stockpile of 50 spare food (Ha!), or setting a house on fire with a sword (Ha ha!). It's easier to appreciate now that I'm better at video games, and slightly more masochistic. The campaign level design on the base game alone, which includes Age of Kings and the Conquerors expansion, will give you over a hundred hours of playtime.The developers give this game a lot of love, and are a nice salute to Ensemble's masterpiece. For instance, in the HD edition, there is better AI that was developed with the Forgotten expansion. The hard AI now actually acts smarter, instead of cheating by getting more resources. So, you can also effectively crush the AI's economy now through raiding and such which was questionable before.The workshop is also nice. I enjoy the texture mods to make the scenery more beautiful and the fire more realistic. Also more blood, and corpses staying longer. More taunts. Player-made campaigns. A lot of competative players like the ""♥♥♥♥♥wood"" mod to make the trees tiny.Overall, I've been impressed with the HD edition, and nominated it for the ""Test Of Time"" award. What other game on steam still has an underestimated active playerbase of over 5,000 people daily for a game from the 90s? Writing this at 10:10am, there is 7,142 people ingame, and it's peaked to 11,616 in the past 30 days. If you like strategy games, this will be a game you come back to again and again.--------------------------------------------------------------------*Reader wants to thumb down review*Wololo!*Reader wants to thumb up review*(Please show some love!If you do thumb down my review, please give me a reason why in the comments.

Once you get on Age of Empires with friends the level of fun goes WAY beyond these AAA games we have today. The game is old school and easy to learn but hard to master. I have 105 hours of gametime at the time of writing this and I am a rookie still. I dont know the best tactic to play the game with. I only know the basics. With this and a huge replay value, you get a game which is worth every single penny. I got this on sale for 5€! I spent 50€ on Grand Theft Auto V and I still enjoy this more!

I've only had it for a few days but it is really simple to get the hang of (thanks to the fun and helpful tutorials), not really frustrating as the AI are quite independant and you don't really have to micromanage every ounce of activity they do. Go and make a few villagers build a lumbermill and they will chop down forests aferwards. The whole building up your empire is satisfying in its own right. Most of my time is spent doing this rather than going into battle. The few battles I've participated in so far have been fun though. I've also heard about a lot of issues with multiplayer, and so far I've only played online with my fiance sitting in the same room with NO problems whatsoever.Very few negative points so far, I can't even think of any right now.

While the original is a great game, a classic, and will go down in history as one of the greatest RTS' ever made - hell, it revolutionized the entire genre - I only  recommend the updated HD version when it is HEAVILY DISCOUNTED.Everything is exactly the same, but (at the time of writing this - 8 months after release) the multiplayer still has ENORMOUS lag and latency issues that BREAK THE MULTIPLAYER - a huge part of why people want to play this game: with friends.It gets my recommendation as I have sunk thousands of hours over the past 14 years into the game, and it boasts a damn near perfect single-player experience, but if you're looking at this as your go-to RTS multiplayer game: look elsewhere until the multiplayer lag issues are addressed."

Regardless, I was very excited to see that it was going to be available on steam. I bought the early access and with over 240 hours of play time, I would completely recommend this game.Microsoft has done an excellent job revamping the graphics without losing the original feel of the game. The units, buildings and game mechanics are exactly as I remembered and the ability to play multiplayer once again is a dream come true for me. The interface is about the same and the Lobby Browser System for multiplayer is quite easy to use. The Lobby is always full and there is always a game to be had.Creating a game is just as easy and the kick user from lobby function never really has to be used. The player base is fairly mature, but entirely intolerant of “noobs”. I’d suggest playing through a few of the campaigns before jumping right into multiplayer like I did. The players in the chat can be very unhelpful, prefer to yell at you in all caps rather than provide suggestions. There is a learning curve but by playing a few single player games and 4v4 multiplayer games, it is very easy to be a decent well rounded player.  10/10 would recommend.I have not played the Forgotten Expansion pack so I have no place to review that.This game is a no brainer if you liked the original release or if you like RTS/RPG style games. It is a very tempting buy if it gets below $10 and an absolute steal below $5. I’d also recommend buying the 4 pack and getting some friends to play with. That way, you can hone your skills without the ridicule of others."

I have happily owned the HD version from the moment I found it on the steam store page. This game is nominated for the ""Test of Time"" Award mainly because of the community and additional gameplay that goes along with it.The workshop is nothing like I have ever seen before. From people editing a whole civilisation to bring you ROMANS to additional maps and mods like Jurassic Park/Hunger Games mash up. The people are and have always been willing to add their own ingenuity to this game that really keeps people coming back to this game over and over. The maps get smarter, and the players get new and exciting ways to challenge their opponents.There is a major problem with desyncing when using certain mods, and your friends will all have to have exactly the same mods active as you to immerse yourself in a multiplayer; but who cares! For the most part, it works gloriously, and I can wreck havoc with my Roman Legionnaires or my beloved War Elephants. As computers have grown and evolved, it has really helped with online gameplay, and we can increase the population size using mods to make the game last even longer than previously anticipated in the games first release. If you've got the internet speed, and the processing speed, then you're going to have a glorious time with the ""Unlimited Population"" mod. #justsayin'.This game definitely deserves to win the Test of Time Award, for being a 17 year old game that we all play not just for nostalgia, but because the strategies keep on adapting!"
