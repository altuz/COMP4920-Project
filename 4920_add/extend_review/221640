This is not a puzzle game, though. It's a tight, twitchy game about perception and nerves, with a bumping soundtrack worth the price of admission by itself.You are a triangle in the center of the screen, rotating around a hexagon. The only keys required to play the game are left arrow and right arrow. You move at one speed: fast. So the moment and amount of time you press provide all the challenge.The screen is divided into light and dark sections that radiate from the points of the hexagon. Walls stretch across a section or multiple sections. When you start a game of Super Hexagon, the walls start closing in toward you. If one hits you, game over.But there's always a way out. You navigate a kind of maze by dodging the walls coming toward you in their multifarious configurations. With practice you can get the timing down and get around a few walls, no problem.Then the hexagon distorts, and starts throbbing in time to the music, and the screen starts spinning, and flashing, and changing colors, and other tricks that are similarly hard to notice because it's all happening so fast.Prepare to be punished.Begin!"

,Recommended,221640,8543194,"Posted: 3 January, 2014",all,Kanaris,"TL;DR- Super Hexagon is amazing and well worth the $3. Heck I would even buy it for $10. Just be prepared to cry a little, and don't buy it if you get nauseous looking at flashy things or are prone to seizures.This game..Wow.Where should I start? At this point I've only had about 5 hours of playing it, but they have been some of the most frenzied and enjoyable hours of my life. I've got to say I've never seen a game like this, and I probably won't again for a long time.In Super Hexagon, you control a triangle which orbits around a hexagon, centered on the screen. Around you, there are light and dark sections, made up of the space between vectors. Within those sections are walls of an outstanding color that come racing toward the Hexagon. You're essentially within a maze of color. If you get hit by a wall, it's game over and your score is submitted automatically so that friends can compete. It may seem like you're trapped, but there is always a way out, no matter how small the gap or how crazy the maneuver you're required to pull. Meanwhile, you have a bunch of crazy lights and effects bouncing around distracting you from the real goal, yet still managing to make the game so much better. On top of this, the music is classic, and superb.Super Hexagon will provide you with 6 different levels, ranging from Hexagon -> Hyper Hexagonest, and from Hard -> Hardes♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. You initially start with the first three- Hard, Harder, Hardest- but once you last for 60 seconds or longer on any of them, the levels go into hyper mode, and you also unlock their hyper mode forms in level select, where you can begin from the 60 second mark at 0 seconds.The way the levels work is that each level has a set of 5-10 'gauntlets' or patterns that it cycles through randomly. So for example, Hexagon will start as a few stray blocks, then it might run its 3x 180 Degree pattern, then its Double Zig-Zag pattern, and then the hexagon in the center will... You'll see ;) . Each level has different patterns, though some are shared throughout the game. Hyper modes contain advanced versions of the patterns used in previous 'normal' levels.Possibly one of the best things about this game is that it only requires two buttons to play. These are Left and Right Arrow, or Buttons 1 and 2 on your mouse. You can also connect a joypad if that's the way you roll. The fact that there is only one speed for the triangle (fast) makes things difficult. After a while you will adjust though, and learn to love the way the game works.Another great feature of Super Hexagon is the fact that once you 'die' from hitting a wall, you can start over within one second, so even if you do somehow manage to rage within this beautiful setting, it probably won't last long, because you'll be off with another try. Other than this, there is an annoying voice when you lose that tells you it's 'gameover' and also one that says 'again' when you retry, but these can be disabled by accessing the game's files and moving the sound files.On top of these things, this game can be booted up and you can be playing any level within 3 seconds. It loads SO FAST.Now, do you think this game is worth it? Would you spend $3 (less than the price of a Big Mac) on this game? I think that you shoul go out and spend your three damn dollars on this amazing game!90/100.ENJOY ^_^"

I remember the time before, when the hills were green and the sky's blue seemed to stretch forever.But it's gone now.I remember hearing about it from one of my friends. I saw him, twitching slightly, staring at the screen in a cold sweat, two fingers moving at a freightning pace. Later, I asked him what it was he was playing. He told me. Told me about the triangle. The hexagons. The pulsating lights. The music, upbeat and never ceasing. I laughed, and said I would pick up my own copy. Said it sounded fun. He warned me against it, the look in his eyes something I had never seen before: desparation, no, begging. I ignored him. I was young and stupid back then.I still remebered the day I first pressed ""Play."" A woman's voice called out the game's name. Softly, as in a morning sunrise. Smiling, I placed my hand upon the mouse, waiting to see what the game had in store.That was a few months ago.It's been a week since the nightmares stopped. But I never stop seeing it. I never stop living it. I'll look into a woman's eyes, but not see their color. I see only the triangle, slowly circling her pupils, taunting me. Sometimes I awake in the night, and I hear the music. Never ending. Never growing softer. Once, I was with my friends, having drinks at th bar. I looked down at my hands. Pulsing red. My arms purple. My friends were unaware that they were all kinds of colours, blue, then green, then an off-white. Then the triangle began orbiting my head. Slowly, I watched it pass. It almost seemed that it was looking back. I heard the music, slowly and softly, but then loud and sped up. Eveything was changing colors. I cried out, but all I heard was ""line."" I cried out again, hoping someone would hear me. ""Hexagon. Hexagon. Hexagon. New Record.""I... I...I'm sorry. I'm sorry for everything.Final score: 11/10No choice but to play again."

Begin. Game over. Begin. Game over. Begin ..."" is something that you will hear very often once you decide to give this challenging, fast paced game a spin (no pun intented). A game that can be beaten in just 6 minutes, but that'll most likeley take atleast a couple of hours instead. If you think you won't feel the urge to throw your computer out of the window after spinning around mathematical shapes for hours and hours - whilst listening to amazing music - read on. Or better said: begin!A closer lookYou take on the role of a little triangle and have to avoid getting hit by mathematical shapes that close in on you at high (and increasing) speed. You do this by moving your triangle to the right or left - very simple indeed - which is quite difficult (at first). That is just about it as far as gameplay goes and may seem to get boring quickly, but that is luckily not the case. There is just something about moving around different patterns and objects at high speed while headbanging to the amazing music.Controlling the triangle is easy: you either use the mouse, arrow keys or a controller. The controls are also very tight, so if you lose, you can only blame it on yourself. You should then either practice more or you could try to switch between kb/m & controller to see with which you truly shine.As I mentioned above, completing the game could take as little as 6 minutes - 1 minute per stage. Naturally it'll take much longer, as your brain doesn't know how to react to this game (yet). That makes it highly replayable since learning these patterns is not something you can do right away. It's all about that muscle memory. Each stage has different patterns that occur somewhat randomly, however, after playing for a while you'll be able to react quickly and appropriately to (almost) any given situation.Graphically, this game is nothing special, but it does have an interesting art style (like most indie games). There are a lot of different colors to be found in each stage that change and vary. The shapes are also straightforward (as they should be) and don't tend to be vague. Something that may keep people away from playing though: The combination of bright/changing colors and the fast rotations may cause headaches.The best feature of this game - for sure - is its amazing soundtrack composed byChipzel, who makes 8-bit music for different games. Were it not for these amazing tunes, I would've never had the courage to keep playing and eventually finish the game. Some say playing the game without sound may let you focus more. Honestly though, you really won't get the 'true'Super Hexagonfeeling and experience without the music.I wouldn't describe this game as being a 'pure fun' one per se, but it sure gets your blood pumping. Besides the adrenaline rush, there is also a high sense of satisfaction when you finally beat that one stage. Or even more so when you beat the whole game: I felt ecstatic when I witnessedthe end, which is a really weird, yet unique ending to a game. I never knew that a 'silly, little' game like this could make me feel so emotional after completing it, but it sure did. Even now, I like to come back to the game regularly to try and increase my highscore or just to enjoy the soundtrack some more.Pros and cons+ Simple, yet fun concept+ Addictive & satisfying+ Amazing soundtrack+ Sweet pricetag+- May cause headaches (though that is personal)- /Final verdictFor this low price, I definitely recommend it for everyone to try. You may be surprised at how good you are at this game. And even if you aren't: practice is key! People who love difficult games on the other hand, will probably enter heaven. With that being said: begi- GAME OVER."

The essence of game is simple to a disgrace: it is necessary to hold on as it is possible more long, operating a triangle and wagging between figures. In game there are six levels of the complexity three of which need to be unblocked the infernal torments. The task becomes complicated that the field on which is your triangle turns, spins, changes corners, figures are transformed, from octagons smoothly turn into squares, and speed doesn't think at all to decline. When you look how other people pass the last levels - the head starts being turned. Music in game is simply divine. Because of it I didn't throw game right at the beginning.Game pulses and moves under music, synchronization between the events on the screen and a sound in earphones absolute, as gives special charm to game. To fly between ""хексагонами"" under such special electronics takes and inspires. Chipzel' huge respect for an excellent soundtrack. (This my opinion and it can not coincide with yours)."

From the minute you press play and select your first level, you are immersed in a world where nothing is wrong. All your worries escape you. For the few seconds you play on your first level, and even every time you enter a level afterwards, you are filled with joy and all fears become easily conquerable. It truly is a feeling of bliss, and I can't get enough of it. Be careful when you enter this utopia, however, because your mind has the possibility of getting emotionally attached. You might not want to leave this wonderland. You might want to drop out of school, or leave your job. You need to remember that reality is where you earn the money to pay for electricity, and you need electricity to play Super Hexagon. The two realities live in perfect harmony. When you play Super Hexagon, you can feel the small triangle as a part of you. You develop feelings for the triangle. It becomes your best friend. It becomes YOU.

Even so, I feel confident in saying that this is an all-time classic, one of the greatest games ever made.Buy Super Hexagon.  Play it for dozens of hours.  Play it with a gamepad's shoulder buttons; using your hands separately will improve cognitive separation between moving left and right over, say, clicking a mouse, and the response is much better than keys on a keyboard.  Turn off v-sync.  Practice using your peripheral vision.  Don't confuse the music tempo for the game speed.  Learn precise button timing so that you can move to your desired position without always staring directly at the center of the screen.  Develop the ability to remain calm at the moment of greatest pressure.Experiment with your mind: distract yourself while you play, reminisce about something unrelated, talk to somebody, look through the screen, put yourself in an abstract place as you try to visualize a vast plane of shapes converging upon you, just zone out, or try the opposite and allow your eyes to dart about the screen in a hyper-aware state.Fall in love.  You'll feel such admiration for the simplicity of this game design, the mechanical and visual beauty of the patterns, the perfect balance that somehow always keeps the accelerating and randomly generated landscape plausibly navigable, and the devious implementation of visual effects to sabotage your sense of absolute motion.

You'll ♥♥♥♥♥♥ uncontrollably at the sound of ""Hexagon"" as the colors melt into a deep blue or shift to white and candy pink.  You'll know that this is where the true game begins.

For over 40 years, he's been working on decoding the brain circuitry behind visuospatial integration and attention.  Very esoteric stuff.  To make a long story short, there's a point in the game about 10 seconds in, when the entire field starts to spin as a single frame of reference - i.e., your pure beleaguered triangle starts moving rapidly, but so do the walls.  My dad pointed out that if certain parts of your brain are working properly and you've played the game enough, those parts of the brain can learn to ignore the spinning and treat the field as stationary.  But that only works so far, and for the really hard levels, you might not get there anytime soon unless you have superb natural reflexes.In other words, this game is batshit crazy hard at first but there are verified and well-studied neurological reasons why it starts out hard and gets easier.  Somewhat.  For some people."

The idea is not only very original, but is also perfectly brought to life, and the soundtrack fits the game splendidly.

76561198112059304,Recommended,221640,12270915,"Posted: 27 September, 2014",all,Pannacone,"Super Hexagon is more of a virus than a game. Its ludicrously low price during Steam sales makes it a quick fifty cent game for avid users to send to friends (and foes) as a seemingly harmless gift. Most people who receive Super Hexagon even believe it's some sort of joke—after all, it's hard to take such a cheap game seriously at first. But on top of being ridiculously contagious, Super Hexagon tends to leave users in a stunned, almost feverish haze of incredulity. This minimalistic, no-frills action game uses hypnotic trance music and fast-paced action to present players with a heart-palpitating test of mindless reflexes and quick thinking that will keep you coming back to it over and over again.You play Super Hexagon as one of the simplest characters known to gamers: a triangle. Your triangle acts as a little arrow that circles around the center figure of a hexagon. The goal of Super Hexagon is to stop this arrow from being hit by shapes that come into the center hexagon at a speed that ranges from hectically fast to cataclismically hypersonic. The gameplay is incredibly simplistic, but skill-intensive. The levels are short: it takes only sixty seconds to beat each one, though those sixty seconds must be done without any errors. Completing a level can take hours of retries, each one pitting the player against their best time so far.Besides its desperately addictive gameplay, one Super Hexagon's most attractive features is, surprisingly enough, the atmosphere of this psychedelically simple action game. Super Hexagon's arena is something like a dance floor: a rhythmically pulsing, spinning, and twisting battleground set to delectably fast-paced trance music from the artist known as Chipzel. Combined with the outlandishly colorful, outstandingly mesmerizing patterns and shapes that make up Super Hexagon's swirling vortex of ""GAME OVER. BEGIN."", this music forces an attractively frenzied pace on the player.Without a doubt, Super Hexagon is worth the $3 price tag, even though most people purchase it when it's less than a dollar. This game will vex and annoy you to the point of fury, but Super Hexagon's irrationally cutthroat gameplay will always keep you coming back for more punishment. Super Hexagon gains an absurdly strong commendation from me—and the players who manage to complete Super Hexagon with all of the achievements unlocked earn an even more precious look of dazed stupidity and awe on my face."

An indie game by Terry Cavanagh that probably didn't take long to make but should keep you coming back for many hours.What is Super Hexagon?The game has one simple goal, to move your triangle around the center hexagon to avoid the oncoming trapezoids for as long as possible. This is the only objective in the game, there are other features such as an arcade mode (for tournaments and events) and hyper mode which is a harder variant of the first levels, but that is the core activity.The game comes with 6 levels (7 if you count the ending sequence), Hexagon, Hexagoner and Hexagonest plus 3 Hyper versions of these 3 too. It has a progressive unlocking system meaning you have to complete Hexagon to unlock Hexagoner and Hyper Hexagon, so if you can't complete the first level you're stuck (if you can't do the first one however it's unlikely you'd be able to complete the others as they are harder).To complete a level you have to navigate your triangle through the gaps and paths in the onslaught of shapes. Reaching 60 seconds will ""complete"" the level and unlock the next and the relevant hyper stage, however you can continue on to try and beat the records of longest survival.Controls & OptionsThe options menu is lacking, it doesn't have any graphical or audio settings except windowed or fullscreen mode, enable or disable sound and enable or disable VSync (which I would recommend disabling as it causes issues for many making it that much harder to play). You can also enable Arcade mode from here and delete your records. The lack of resolution selection means you may have letterboxing or black bars on the side of your screen.Surprisingly for a small indie game like this the game does support Xbox360 controllers (and steam controller but that goes without saying). The gamepad controls can be configured here, however there is no joystick support as far as I can tell which would be my primary reason for using a controller. On the keyboard side of the things, the keys (left and right arrow keys to move, space to select stuff, esc for going back, tab to see leaderboard) aren't re-bindable.Aesthetic & MusicThe aesthetic is minimalistic while also being vibrant with colour. The scheme varies from level to level, but is always pulsating and moving around - add this to changes in colour while playing makes the whole thing very psychedelic indeed. After playing for more than a few minutes your eyes will start focusing on different things and you become completed entranced in the game, like being hypnotised. This might be a bad thing, and you might experience visual sickness but for me it just becomes that much more ""intense"" of an experience. You feel on the edge of your seat, thinking so hard to just get those last 2 seconds.The soundtrack is absolutely wonderful, but I'm biased as I already like chiptune. Chipzel the composer has made 3 tracks (plus a special for the ending), one for each set of levels, that last roughly a minute and will loop if you survive longer. A genius decision by Terry Cavanagh (the designer) was to start levels at different points in the music tracks, so if you aren't very good you don't just hear the first 5 seconds of music every time you start, and instead hear most of it eventually. The soundtrack, which is also available fromChipzel's Websiteis exciting and fast-paced. The shapes will also pulsate in time with the rhythm for extra effect.Enjoyment & ValueI think people's primary concern with this game is that they'd either get bored too quickly or it'd be too difficult and they'd give up after not long. Firstly, I've played this game for 6 hours, purely in 10 minute bursts (and others in reviews here have played for much longer). If I can't decide what game to play, or I'm bored, hit up Super Hexagon and play for a couple minutes. Its great for these moments, because you want to keep coming back to the game. Unless you've played for ages there will normally be something you haven't completed yet. And even then you can shoot for the top records.In terms of difficulty, yes it is difficult, and at first you will wonder how on Earth you'll complete the first level. I felt the same too, but now the first level is a slow breeze. You improve and you learn patterns and you get better. You might see a video of someone surviving the hardest level for an hour but that's because he/she has played the game for many many hours. The game also has the advantage of its purity in mechanics. It's simple but fair, and if you died you know for sure that was your fault. You say to yourself: ""Darn that was close. I'll remember that bit for next time though, I can do better."" Then you start again and maybe get a second longer than last time, and so on.For its price, it's well worth the value. I have had so much fun with this game, and those special moments when you beat a level for a first time - it just feels amazing, you feel like a Zen master of all shapes and it really negates those hundreds of frustrating tries. I will admit this isn't for everyone though, some might get frustrated at the game and not bother, rather than persist. It requires a certain amount of effort, and to be fair, skill to really get the most enjoyment out of the game. Another improvement that could be made, would be more content and levels. More great music, more beautiful kaleidoscope images, possibly some easier levels to ease people in and some harder levels for the veterans, or maybe an endless mode where you can sit back, watch and listen.Should you buy Super Hexagon?I picked this game up when it was only sale for something like £0.50 GBP, and even if it's not, I would highly recommend purchasing this if you need a small game on the side. It's challenging and nerve-wracking in its mechanics but also tranquil and eloquent in its design. It isn't perfect, and maybe suited more as a mobile game (which it is). It doesn't have all the features that you'd want from an arcade indie game and is lacking a bit on the content side, but you could argue that adding in more levels and slightly useless modes and leaderboards would take away from its simplicity. But for those moments when you need to take a break from hardcore games, but still want something difficult, you can go into your own little bubble of colour and music and just focus on one simple task - to become a Hexagon.This is my first review and if you have any questions or criticism then feel free to leave a comment."

,Recommended,221640,14102348,"Posted: 21 January, 2015",all,Jadarma,"OverviewSuper Hexagonis in my opinion the perfect example of when simplicity does not impact on gameplay. The concept is simple, ridiculous, challenging and to a certain point, addictive. A great, minimalistic rythm game where you control a triangle in its struggle to survive from the evercollapsing environment while nodding your head to some cool electro music.The Pros:Simple yet Fun- The game's objective is simple. The music keeps it entertaining. The beautiful changing colors make it fun to watch. Even the frustrating deaths make it enjoyable. This is one of those games where you will die. A lot, a lot of times, however you will still try to move on.Great Music- The game uses groovy, fast paced music that surprisingly won't seem repetitive after listening to it countless times (due to how much you will have to restart the game). I don't even like electro music, but this is amazing. My compliments to the author(s)Interesting... Art?- The game has a nice rainbow filter and a geometric generating pattern. It blends perfectly with the music. I cannot compliment the graphics that... are not even there, but the minimalist, colorful aproach is something I personally like.The Cons:Short- The game has 6 levels, or should I say 3, with two difficulty steps each. Although they take a long time to bead, I would have liked to see some more customisability, like a end game feature where you can alter the parameters.Difficult- I'm not going to sugarcoat it, this game was pretty hard. Look at my playtime. That's how long it took me to beat the last level. While I don't necessarily find it a con, unpatient people will, so heads up before saying: ""Oh, just 6 achievements? I'll do it in an hour!""ConclusionA great rythm game for cheap, both fun to kill time and test your reaction time. Definitely buy it if you see it on sale!If you enjoyed this review and want to see more of my work,consider joining my groupandfollow my curatorpage! Link to the right!Jad's List - Curator Group"

It's a simple game with 3 initial levels which, as you individually complete them, unlock an even harder version of themselves called Hyper Mode.  Your goal in the game is to guide a small arrow through a series of visually perplexing walls and mazes that spin and pulse to the tune of techno music, until you reach the 60-second mark where a level is considered complete.  Even the most basic level is called ""Hard"", with subsequent levels being ""Harder"", ""Hardest"", and even ""Hardester"" once you unlock the Hyper levels.If this is any indication, this game is not for the faint of heart as the challenge can get mind-meltingly difficult.  Yet, when you first boot up the game and undoubtedly get put to shame a few times, sleep on it and you'll find that the game is indeed possible to beat.  It takes some mental training and twitchy fingers, but the fun of it all will carry you until you're able to rise to the occasion.  It's a blast to play and the kind of game you can quickly load, try your skills at for a few minutes, then leave for another time.

It´s pretty simplistic, but completely genius in certain way.Point of the game is to avoid obstacles, coming from six directions (or less, when map changes the pace), with little triangle moving 360 around the center.Simple, right? Not so fast! To complete the stage, you need to survive for 60 seconds, during which game changes speed, rotation, tilt, patterns, number of directions and colors. If you die, you start from the zero.And you will die, A LOT.I think that havingeasiest mode labeled as ""hard""speaks for itself.Compared to this, every nightmare mode (insert game of your chioce here) feels like a child´s play.Prepare to have you memory and reactions challenged.Important aspects to be talked are actual fun and enjoyment. While it is really challenging and satisfying,I miss something that would make me to come back. All you can really do is to practice and die until you get to some point, where you would even dream about hexagons.Idea is great, music is great, voices are great. But it just feels to me there are so many other games that you would like to spend time with, rather than Super Hexagon.I´m sorry, but recommending the game would be hypocritical at this point, I will have to go different way than the crowd.But still, you might want to check it out, before trusting some random guy.And, also, big respect for those that managed to complete the game!*Played with controller (alternatively playable with keyboard or mouse - all are OK)***** 5/10***** 50%"

But it is true you will ragequit sometimes , it's unavoidable.There is a lady announcer that tells you your current level when you reach it , the level being just a reference to the time in one level (0 seconds=point 10 seconds=line 20 seconds=triangle 30 seconds=square 45 seconds=pentagon 60 seconds=hexagon).She also tells you 'Begin' at the start and 'Game Over' when you fail to avoid the obstacles , (wich trust me , you will hear a lot) and 'Excelent' when you beat your record , you will be happy when you hear this , but most of the times you will die shortly after.Controls are left and right arrow keys , A and D , left and right mouse buttons , and gamepad.The soundtrack is amazying , in my opinion , and it fits the game realy well.The visuals are like you see in the screenshots , also the game is a little bit flashy and fast , and may give some problems to epileptics.I could detail more , but do you realy need so much reason to buy a 3 euro game that will surely entertain you (but how much is based on your motivation) , and if you have doubts get it at a sale , definately worth it :)"

The name already tells us that this game has to do with hexagons and yes. You're playing a triangle which moves in circles around a hexagon, trying to avoid the bar comming from outside to the middle. The first Level is a bit special, because the hexagon turns into a Square and back.Anyway, I suppose more than 4 points isn't possible. :/★ ★ ★ ★ ☆Graphics:hmmmm... Simple... and perhaps you feel like the 3rd Level is on LSD.^^ But all in one this graphic fits to the game.★ ★ ★ ★ ☆Leveldesign:As I've already mentioned it, e.g. the first Level has the Square-Special-Thing, many Levels have different stuff to offer. The 3rd Level has a quick 180° turn, which is quite confusing if you're not common with that.^^Something which is impossible to avoid, is to memories some patterns of certain level. Which pattern appears is random, but they look always the same and of course it's a useful skill to win. :)After you've got 60 sec. on a level the level changes from: Lvl1 -> Lvl4, Lvl2 -> Lvl5, Lvl3 -> Lvl6,Lvl4 -> Lvl4(Special), Lvl5 -> Lvl5(Special), Lvl6 -> Lvl6(Special) [Note: A Special Level is the part after 60 sec of a certain Level beyond 3!]After 120 sec. the Level changes again and so on.(e.g. If you start at Lvl1 -> Lvl4 -> Lvl4(Special) -> Lvl5 -> Lvl5(Special) -> Lvl6 -> Lvl6(Special)So you see they prevent an repetition by changing the levels.★ ★ ★ ★ ★Music:Music:First the music was not my taste. After playing longer and longer, it get better and better. So at the end I really liked the music.^^ A bit weird, isn't it?The Game contains 3 ½ Soundtrack. Each Lvl pair 1-4,2-5,3-6 have one and the ending song which is actually a reversed version of the last one. That's why I wrote ½. :pbtw: After you finish the 6th Level (get 60 sec.) you've beaten the game and when you die, a kind of credits appear. The game plays the music of the last Level reversed and the bars now came out of the hexagon. It was an amazing feeling and of course a awesome ending.★ ★ ★ ★ ☆At the end, i think it's worth to buy Super Hexagon. Makes fun. Cheap. Challenging.Sadly just 4/5 Points... :/★ ★ ★ ★ ☆"

The objective of the game is simple enough navigate your triangle through the obstacle for sixty seconds on every stage to win. Well its a bit more complex than that there are hyper modes you need to beat in order to win and the stages get faster and faster as you progress.

This is a review by a disabled gamer (I only play with a mouse).http://youtu.be/fAtaCmT_YnIAs soon as I opened the game I hit an immediate roadblock.  You begin full screen with your left and right mouse buttons only scrolling the menu.  To actually select anything on the menu, the game says to press space bar.   I later accidentally discovered you can press both mouse buttons simultaneously to act as a space bar. but the game itself never tells you this.  So the first 5 minutes of my experience was spent trying to find someone to come to my PC to press space so I could access options.  Once I had help and could access the options, I could change to windowed mode.  Windowed mode is borderless and worked well with onscreen keyboard.  You can play with your mouse or keyboard only.  There's also an option for joypad.Gameplay itself can be completely mouse controlled.  Left click to spin board left, right click spin board right.  Clicking needs to be quick to help with precision.  While Fun and adictive, it can also be frustrating. I could only last a few seconds.  The game is difficult for everyone with game modes starting with hard and moving on to harder, hardest & several locked levels.  With that in mind, I also had someone without a disability play and noticed it was still difficult to get far but moves seemed to be more precise.The game is playable with only a mouse or keyboard.  That is Assuming you can press both mouse buttons at once or have someone who can press space to get it out of full screen, it is mouse only playable.  That being said, if you can't make quick agile clicks, get easily frustrated, or have issues with flashing spinning graphics...  I would avoid this game.Besides issues you might have with accessibility, the game IS addictive fun, even when you're losing."

The rounds are short enough that you don't feel as though you wasted time when you die.This game is almost a replacement for drugs.

It fits under Level 3 of the Psychedelic Experience ranking:Level 3Very obvious visuals, everything looks curved and warped, patterns and kaleidoscopes seen on walls and faces. Some mild hallucinations such as rivers flowing in wood grain or 'mother of pearl' surfaces. Closed-eye hallucinations become 3-dimensional. There is some confusing of the senses (synesthesia). Time distortions and 'moments of eternity'. Movement at times becomes extremely difficult (too much effort required).

The game itself, rotate a triangle aound the center shape and avoid the lines as the stage revolves, is simple, but made in such a way that the it seems more like a hypnotic work of art. Warning, this game is really hard and really addictive. You will spend hours trying to beat a stage that takes about a minute to beat. But if you are looking for a challenge, buy it. Just buy it. The gameplay is so much fun that I find no problem dying over and over, and it is so much fun that it never seems frustrating, you just play, die, play, and die. I have probably put at least 400 hours into this game by running it off of school laptops by a flashdrive (yes, I have it on both steam and bought it from the website), and it has never dissappointed me. 10/10, would gladly waste my life on this again."

The colours are extremely vibrant and shift after you get a certain distance into the game. The music in the game is pure amazing it really gets you pumped and stay's in your mind afterwards. The best thing about the music is that it changes meaning the experience differs per time you play. The game has various difficulties and get's progressively harder as you move up as it should. The rising difficulty means that the obstacles and gaps get faster and more complex.I would recommend this game to anybody who want's a fantastic game to play which is highly addicting.

You can also use the joystick on a controller, however I find it hard to use since you have to spin it back to the center before being able to move in the other direction.Also if you have played the flash version called Hexagon, or a clone of this game, you might be pleased to find out that this games hit detection is a lot fairer than that of the flash game.Oh, but if you tend to throw things when angry, this might not be for you. Otherwise I certainly recommend it."

And what happens in the endgame is probably one of the best game endings I'll ever experience. It might not mean a lot to someone who just watches the Youtube video, but enduring the trial and error of this game's later levels is, all in all, feels worth more than getting free banana bread in the mail. And I love banana bread.You will hate this game. You'll wish you could of bought it at Gamestop so you can crumple up the disc and shove it in the garbage disposal. You may even feel like punching a hole through your monitor. But alas, everyone couldn't possibly feel that way, so kudos to you if you have attained Yogi.Some would argue that Super Hexagon is merely an endurance test vs. a genuinely difficult game. They would be right, up to a certain point. There's not much one can endure in a single sitting once the hand cramps set in, since the possibility of victory drains sharply upon those handicaps, utterly forcing you to rest. The overall experience though, from start to possible finish, could be classified as a very long endurance test.Super Hexagon is a worthwhile experience if you as the player choose to make it so. It will not pity you for your finger aches, thousands of attempts, or rage. It only awaits for you to complete the stage."

You soon discover that you're not the only being in this universe as you are quickly rushed by hoards of irregular shapes, jealous of your perfection. You have been granted with powers of lateral movement, which you can use to inverse-circle strafe. You have no weapons - Fortunately, these irregular shaped beings are not too bright; with a well timed side-step, they'll rush themselves into the void and be obliterated.This might seem very straightforward, but the universe itself plots against you - warping and spinning the landscape to disorientate the player.You are not completely alone, however, as a narrator/companion helps you on your way. When you reach certain goals, she grants you various morale boosts. She will let you know when you've achieved your goal, but also gently lets you down when you fail. If you're up for a challenge - you can play for 120s through and unlock the secret dialogue with her.Upon completion of the game, the universe concedes defeat and no longer pulls its landscape-changing stunts. However, the hoards are ever present, allowing you to play on after finishing the main quest.Features:*Six unique universes*Impeccable naration*Outstanding soundtrack*Lots of nice coloursScore: Δ/Δ"

,Not Recommended,221640,21199888,"Posted: 13 February, 2016",all,Bumblebugbee3,"Simply put, Super Hexagon is a test of reflexes and patience.  An inexpensive experience that is equal parts audio and visual.  This is an incredibly simple, straight-forward survival game.  Don't expect any bells and whistles, what you see is what you get.  After playing or watching this game for a minute you'll have seen everything it has to offer.The concept of Super Hexagon is simple; you must spin around the center of the screen trying avoid the incoming obstacles.  Each obstacle is tied to one of the six alternating sections that split up the screen.  Training your eyes to focus on the light and dark sections is key to quickly finding escape routes.  It takes a while just to get the feel of moving around.  Getting used to the sensitivity of the movement and developing your latency to react to different situations is one the biggest learning curves you have to overcome.Be warned, this game is incredibly challenging!  This is quickly noted as your only difficulty choices range from hard, harder, and hardest.  Don't expect to last more than a couple seconds with everything being thrown at you.  Over time you'll become more comfortable with the patterns which change every 10 to 15 seconds.  However, the procedurally generated levels ensure you can't just memorize particular routes.  If dodging obstacles wasn't enough the screen is constantly spinning and on a whim it can change its direction.Music plays a big role in this game.  The fast-paced electronic music fits the mood of this game perfectly.  As the hexagon in the center pulses and the sections change colors you feel your adrenaline surge.  Every time you fail and restart it feels like nothing has happened and the party is still going full blast.  It feels like the music is cheering you on; if your ears can keep up then so should your reflexes.  Hearing the announcer every time you enter a new region is a quick refreshing respite from the intensity of the music and gameplay.For me this game is just to simple and unfulfilling.  There really is no feedback loop or incentive to keep playing.  Yes, there is some sense of accomplish every time you gain a second or two on your previous best score.  However, its not nearly enough to make up for the misery of failing over and over again.  The fact that your only reward for doing good is a new high score combined with the incredible training need to master the sensitively of the controls and what little joy was to be had quickly becomes washed out.  If all you want is a really good challenge to master you may enjoy this game otherwise don't waster your time on this title."

It's bright neon colours and that awesome techno music just helps to make your mind confused and increase the amount of rages you will have after dying seconds from your new high score.The way the game uses no features to help you to advance for example, no upgrades, no microtransactions or power ups makes the game addictive. This makes the game competitive just like flappy birds because their is no help. Many players may feel the basic indie game isn't big enough with no fancy graphics and no never ending list of upgrades to make them seem the world's best player. But the true gamers will know that this is a real game with progression only coming from learning how to play.My 7 hours playing time and thousands of attempts has lead me to a score of 69.52 seconds on the first level and i'm still not giving up until it is complete."

Left moves you left around the hexagon, right moves you right, and you must avoid the oncoming obstacles. Sounds simple, right? Ha, I've only just begun to learn how difficult it can get (I've just unlocked Hyper Hexagonest mode) and certain patterns can be seen, but learning to cope with those, that's the real challenge. In terms of soundtrack, this game has Chipzel on the board, and even after resetting the game probably a million times, the music never drove me insane, it's that good. I can happily listen to Focus and Otis on repeat for many many hours on end. Courtesy is still good, but it's a bit more toned down, which suits the stage, but it's not as good for random listening, in my opinion, as Otis or Focus.Overall, this game gets a 9.5/10 from me. It lost 0.5 because sometimes the controls can wander off on their own sometimes, even just breifly, but that could be a problem on my end."

The game felt incredibly difficult, and my brain just could not keep up with the patterns, and speed at which the game was playing at.About an hour into playing, I started noticing patterns, one after another, my skills refined at each one of these certain patterns that the game throws at you, and eventually, I mastered the first level. I was hooked.Super Hexagon tests your reactions in a way no game ever does, patterns soon become forged into the players brain, and eventually, levels can be completed without thinking.The game does everything right, it is almost completely flawless, the gameplay is responsive, and the addiction, is bloody real.This is my go to game, when I cannot think of another game to play; this is because the game loads up incredibly fast, and getting into a run is quick, everytime I open it up, I end up spending at least an hour on it.The game took me 30 hours to complete, and the moment of completion was incredibly satisfying.The only flaws to this, almost perfect game, is the screen tearing.

Besides the obvious hand-eye-coordination, Super Hexagon heavily affects your ability to focus on several levels.  It hits your brain's ability to track/manipulate a small, moving object, all while subjected to visual distraction and spacial distortion that prevent you from mentally caching information.  It requires you to mentally buffer between 3 and 6 units of movement, with one move falling off the buffer as you perform it and a new move being added to the end at the same time.  It also taps into the brain's ability to slow perception.You have to personally improve in order to proceed.  The most luck will do is buy you an extra couple units of time before you die and start over.  There is no grinding or level memorization (though there is lightpatternrecognition).  You cannot beat this game without being good at it.  Since it is a skill game, though, the abilities you develop to focus and make buffered, rapid decisions will carry over to anything else you do that call for the same things.I think that's what's so addictive about Super Hexagon.  The knowledge thatit's making you better at somethingwhile the mental stress and flashing colors are eroding your sanity.  The thing that keeps it from being too frustrating isit is alwaysyour faultwhen you die.When you stop making mistakes you stop dying.Here are some things you should know about the game play:*  Epileptics shouldn't even watch the video, let alone play the game.*  This is basically a randomly-generated maze, except the walls are constantly hurtling towards you, every aspect of the game is designed to cause you to lose track of what you're doing, and death is instant the first time you make an error.  You can't pause or make the walls stop coming.  You just keep navigating your way forever or until you die.* Everything occurs in what I'll call ""units"", which will represent 1/6 the amount of time for what's just beyond the edge of the screen to reach the middle.  Each wall is between 1 and 2 units of time in depth (yes, I'm using time as a measurement of depth and yes that makes sense).*  In playing this game you will maintain a mental buffer of what you'll be doing over 6 units of time.  This is a live action game, so I mean you'll literally be doing this in your head.  Most of the things thrown at you will come in blocks where you have 2 units of time to move (or stay still).*  As you're executing the current move and removing it from your mental buffer you're also adding 1 - 2 units to the opposite end of the buffer.  Reminder: this buffer exists solely in your own mind.*  You can do three things in this game: rotate clockwise, rotate counterclockwise, and stay still.  Doing the wrong one usually kills you.Regarding some complaints I've heard on the controls:*  I've heard people recommend using a controller.  I don't think that advice is universal.  I found it easier to use the A and D keys from playing a lot of games where you use your left hand and the WASD keys even though I am right-handed.*  Your control of the triangle/cursor is inexact.  It's important to reverse direction (when possible) to recenter it.  The reason for movement being freeform is because you will occasionally need to move a hair's width over the line to dodge one wall then immediately reverse direction to avoid being killed by the next wall.  If your movement was less twitchy you could not do this.*  There is a very slight delay between pressing one of the two move buttons and your cursor moving.  If you hold a button down you will move in that direction (""spin"") until you release it.  This is faster than tapping to move the same amount of distance because it only has one delay, but requires better timing to avoid killing yourself.  This is not accidental; there will be times when doing anything other than a controlled spin will be too slow (which will kill you)....Despite how that might sound, this game is actually a lot of fun because it challenges your brain.

Kind of.Super Hexagon is a game that is very well-designed, both visually, mechanically, and stylistically. This game is very straightforward both in concept and execution, which allows it to have solid, refined gameplay. It also has a great soundtrack and progression in difficulty, and a pretty clever ending scene makes it very satisfying to beat.That said, it's also a game that can be very frustrating.

If the tight controls and vibrant colors don't make you want to buy this game (and come on, you should, it's VERY cheap), then the incredible chiptune/electronica soundtrack most definitely will.  And if you thought the first stage was impossible, then guess what?  You're not even close to done.  There's five more hair-pullingly difficult stages after that, but the music...oh, jeez, the music...it's gonna keep you coming back for more, trust me.  Despite the crazy difficulty of this game, I never quit it because of how much of a visual and audible spectacle it was every single time I played it.  And that's what insanely hard games like this need: an addicting hook that keeps you wanting to play no matter how hard it gets.  And when I say this game is hard, I mean that one playthough could last anywhere from one second to thirty, depending on how good your reflexes are.  It's THAT hard...and that's only the first stage.  But if you're like me, you won't play this for the difficulty.  You'll play it for the vibrant lights and killer sound.  Pick this up.  Now."

If you take the game and its ""Easy"" difficult, which is aptly named 'hard' It may seem difficult but if you keep trying and building up your memory and reaction time, you can achieve it easily. After you play for as long as I did the patterns start to merge together and you subconciously know what is going to happen, you predict the random generation.As you feel your way through the first three levels you start to learn that the game has a few tricks that you won't expect your first hour or three, but as the advisor speaks its single words to you ""Line"" ""Triangle"" Square"" ""Pentagon"" ""Hexagon"" you feel empowered after each of these dauntful yet encouraging quotes. And once you begin to get higher scores like mine on the 'Hard' difficulty of 5+ minutes, everytime you reach a new minute you here ""Awesome"" like you have finally accomplished a goal and milestone. But as the adventure continues to the final levels, you start to feel a shadow looking down on you as you reach an impassable barrier on your quest to 60 seconds.With every minute passing you feel more and more frustrated by the lack of progress until you finally feel your way through the patterns that you haven't yet seen, you being to make the progress you wanted and are on top of the world, then at 50+ seconds the game pulls a trick and you are back to zero. The cycle of time starts again and you are stuck there. And once you beat the game the milestones only continue to grow, forever and eventually into 5, 10, 15 minutes of Hexagon.This is the Super Hexagon way, a challenge and a frustration, but also a accomplishing task.

Perfect for meditation and for mindgames where you try not to mess up due to thinking thoughts that will break concentration.  It has a deep message that relates to life.  My only problem with this game is the difficulty ranking.  I would put hyper hexagon as harder than hyper hexagoner and perhaps even harder than hyper hexagonest due to difficulties of pentagon.  The fundamentals to being good at this game is being able to learn the patterns and be able to recognize the patterns and be able to make your hold timings consistently long so that turning is like multiple choice between 1,2,3 sectors and direction rather than watching the arrow turn.  The game can be beaten in just over 4 minutes I think if you go hexagon->hexagoner->hexagonist+hyperhexagonist with strategic dying."

Now, let's get into it.Super Hexagon is probably the most fun, addicting, yet rage enducing game I have played before. At the beginning, I didn't even know that the left arrow key makes you go left, and the same with the right. This game is very, very diffcult at the beginning. As you get to learn the patterns, you slowly pass the levels, until you hit the hyper mode levels. These levels are challenging, although not as hard as your first try. Overall, I would say that this is a great game to play, and I always go to this game if I am ever just bored out of my mind.Now... To something that I would like to change.First off, every level is a pattern. Sure, there are a few of them. I would love it so much more if there was always a different pattern to the level. Although, that would make it much harder, I would be way more satisfied about when I beat the levels, because I know that I beat it, not even knowing what I was going into.Overall, I rate this game a 9/10. An 11/10 on the rage scale. Maybe punching your desk so hard that your knuckles hurt for 2 weeks isn't a good idea. Whatever, I still LOVE this game!!"

Beating the last stage is possibly the most rewarding and satisfying thing I have ever experienced in gaming, no exaggeration.One piece of advice - every so often, go onto a harder level for 5 minutes or so.

I have beaten the game, 2 minutes per level, and figured I'd write a review.Pros:- The game is crazy fun.  Seriously.  It can be a pain to get into, but when you end up getting to a number like 56 seconds, it feels impossible to put the game down before completeing said level.- Fair.  Contrary to popular belief (based off of what I've heard), this game is very fair.  However, it is NOT forgiving (see cons).  If you have good reactions (and have played enough to memorize the patterns), the game actually isn't that hard.- It's competitive.  No, I don't mean that in the same way E-Sports is.  I mean, if you have multiple friends who all enjoy this game, it's a decent game to compete for high-scores in.- Soundtrack.  Enough said.Cons:- Repetitive.  This game doesn't ever chage.  That's why once you memorize the patterns, the game get's easy, and quickly.- Flashing lights.  The game can cause headaches if you aren't careful.  If you have epilepsy, stay away.- The skill gap is absurd.  When you first pick this game up, it will feel like HELL.  I remember literally throwing my phone across my room, complaining that it was impossible.  Improving is a struggle.- Unforgiving.  You don't get three lives.  One mistake, you're out, and have to restart.  Granted, you only have to stay alive for 60 seconds, so a death isn't all that destructive in terms of progress.  But still, this is rather tedious, and requires perfection.Overall, I'd highly recommend this game, it's a nice throwback to retro that's highly enjoyable, even if only for a little while ^_^"

Before you realize it, you'll get all the achievements when you see how many hours you've actually put into the game.I reccomend it, but don't put too much time into trying to beat it.

You will most likely think this game is dumb at first. You will push this game away to a backburner, but not for long. Eventually, something deep inside will cause you to give this game another go. And from that go, many more will occur.The controls (using left/right arrow keys) are accurate and precise once you spend a bit of time on them.The music, while simple, motivates you to keep going in a stage. If you die a lot though, it can become repetitive, but it's not that bad.Visually, the game varies by stage. Some stages have very little contrast between the colors, but you will get used to it.Overall, this game will keep you coming back for more until there is nothing more to do. Unlike simliar games, you will not get mad when you lose, except when you first get it. Battling with yourself is what this game will evoke, but there is also leaderboards if you need an external motive to push you. Once you get into Super Hexagon, you will never be able to get out."

,Recommended,221640,19064432,"Posted: 13 November, 2015",all,Zaphite,"Super Hexagon is a rhythm/music game that requires fast reactions to move out of the way of obstacles that come at you all while being able to enjoy a great soundtrack and psychedelic visuals.The Good:This game is a minimalistic game, but that doesn't at all detract from the addicting gameplay and large amounts of enjoyment to be had. The only controls are left and right which are used to move your cursor around the center of the screen, which is where the obstacles come from, which are basically just lines. This may sound very simple but the game uses the energetic music, vibrant colors, and lots of movement to create a very intense atmosphere that makes you want to keep trying in order to last as long as possible in each level. There is plenty of content for only $2.99, the gameplay stays consistent throughout but later levels add in some different elements to make it harder. The overall difficulty is fairly high, but every time you die you want to start right back up again so I would say that it is well balanced in that respect. As I briefly mentioned earlier, the music in the game is great and without it or even maybe with different music, the game would not be nearly as good.The Bad:The combination of movement and colors could potentially make some people have headaches or feel ill, if you have a tendency to react badly to these types of games then I would recommend taking caution before purchasing the game. Although I believe the difficulty of the game to be fairly well balanced, others may feel that the game is much too difficult and get frustrated easily. Occasionally, the controls can seem a little too ""slippery"" but it didn't stop me too much from playing the game and is not a major problem.For only $2.99, Super Hexagon keeps you on the edge of your seat and makes you want to retry every time you die, with a great combination of movement, visuals, and music that creates a very intense and energetic game."

Seven pages on Diablo 3? Geeeez! So I think it’s high time I wrote something concise. Maybe something about a page long? I think that sounds good. Oh, crap. I’m wasting space.Super Hexagon, by Terry Cavanagh, is a little indie game that I love. And by little I mean it’s 35MBs. Super Hexagon, if you don’t know, is a game about avoiding shapes encroaching in upon you, while the camera spins around, the colors flash and change, and really good techno plays in the background. So it’s like a rave but, without the other sweaty people.This game is tough though, don’t let the simple premise fool you. It can be quite hard to keep your bearings while the game’s camera spins 180 degrees and the constantly moving shapes swirl towards you with the sole purpose of… actually they’re just obstacles. Not malevolent in any way. Although you might disagree when you play for yourself.The main goal in Super Hexagon is to last as long as you can on it’s three levels. Which is quite challenging, but I already mentioned that. If you can manage to last 60 seconds, whether by sheer skill or a divine blessing, the game will speed up and the colors will change. Welcome to Hyper mode.I think the longest I’ve lasted on the first level is 72 seconds. -- let me check… yup, 72.26 seconds and damn proud of it!By entering hyper mode in a particular level-- Hexagon, Hexagoner, and of course, Hexagonest, respectively-- you unlock the ability to jump straight into the Hyper modes of each level.I’ve managed to survive 18 seconds on Hyper Hexagon!Super Hexagon is very fast, very fun, and has a great soundtrack. Also it can be infuriatingly hard. You’ll probably hear “Game Over” and “Begin” more than the actual music… But hey this game is just simple, pure, fun. It’s worth a try just to experience it. Also you can compete with your friends to see who can survive longest. Like in real life.And it’s only like 3 dollars. Give it a shot! The worst thing that can happen is that, upon losing, you hit your desk and swear violently. But, I don’t want to talk about that...Like this review? Check out100hoursave.comfor more."

This keeps going until you're just infront of the 60 goal, infront of which you will fail by just a few seconds because you got too excited. Lastly you will cross the 60 seconds and feel like someone took a huge burden off of you.Filled with excitement of beating the first level you will start the second one from which the frustration of going back to failing at merely a few seconds will drive you away.

It'll make you swear like a sailor for hours while you desperately try to beat your score, even by a fraction of a second; all of this is in the name of 'progression'. It's made worse when you set your sights on that ambitious score your friend got earlier. The music isn't bad either, and it's very retro-chiptune in style. But if you dislike it, you can also choose to mute the music and play your own in the background and rock out to something while you die over and over again.Visually, the game screws with you, horribly. You'll feel completely dazed and confused while you're trying to navigate away from the impending death-blocks flying towards your cursor. It takes several attempts before you get a solid handle on how to move and avoid the blocks. It's a very neat game to break out at a gathering of friends and watch them struggle and curse at it while they try to last beyond 12 seconds.I rate this game highly, and I still have yet to plumb the depths of the harder difficulty settings. I only just recently went beyond a minute at the easiest setting, and I shudder to imagine getting good enough at the game to last as long on the upper echelons. I've even purchased copies for family and friends. Get this game and give it a shot, especially if you're hankering after some good old fashioned classic gaming."

Or, to be more precise, a ""twitch"" reflex game. This game challenges you to, as a triangle orbiting a [spinning, strobing] hexagon, survive for 60 seconds--just one minute--in a minefield of walls headed towards the hexagon your triangle is orbiting. While a lot of people don't have the patience to practice such a seemingly fruitless game enough to get past the first levels (the third, ""Hexagonest"" being my everest for the longest time), once you sink an hour or so in the game and finally survive the first level, it feels, well, about as rewarding as a twitch game can get, which scales precisely on how difficult it was to complete the level and how many tries it took to finally unlock the next one. For just three dollars, this is a really good game, and I'd definitely recommend others buy it... that is, if they can handle the mind-melting strobe effects on top of a rapidly spinning playing field.Warning: if there is ANY chance that rapidly flashing lights could cause any adverse reactions (well, greater than getting annoyed, that is) in you, DO NOT TOUCH THIS GAME."

I think that you should buy this game RIGHT NOW!Okay so I gotta explain why I want you to buy Super Hexagon.Alright. Here's some pros and cons.Pros- The game is really fun and addictive (In the ''Omg this is so cool! I want more!'' way, not the ''OH S**T I'VE BEEN PLAYING FOR 15 HOURS! I GOTTO BE AT WORK IN 10 MINUTES!'' way.- It's super cheap. Like comon 2,99€/$ is a really good price. And I got it on sale for 1,01€!- When you fail. It's not because of the game being unfair. It's your own fault for not paying enough attention. (When I die, I’m never frustrated, just a bit annoied because of my own ineptitude.)- It's really hard in a fair and fun sorta way.Cons- It's addictive as Hell. I keep coming back when I got time and sometimes I play for a good hour straight (1 try lasts from 5 seconds to 65 seconds).- Could Use more levels. Only six in the game right now, but you get a♥♥♥♥♥♥load of fun and gameplay out of them.Final thoughts: I HIGLY recommend this game. It's great. It's really fun and it puts up a real challange. It's also quite addictive, But not in a ''Take up all your time and ruin your life'' sorta way. Overall I rate 9.9/10."

Super Hexagon is about moving a triangle in the center of the map, where your goal is to keep moving for as long as you can without hitting any of the colored lines. These lines vary in color and eventually get to the most ridiculous patterns that prove a challenge in dodging!For Gameplay all you really do is use the arrow keys to move the triangle around. Remember, you need fast reflexes, as one screw up will make it to where you won't have enough time to dodge the line, causing you to restart the WHOLE thing. I think a few of you at this point are really sad after getting close to beating Hexagonist. Speaking of Hexagonist...When you reach a certain time limit in a particular difficulty, you will unlock another difficulty that is more challenging. The higher the difficulty is, the more lines are on screen and their speed is upped!As for graphics, there is almost no good way to describe them. Trippy! That's for sure, the colors are constantly changing like its a rainbow!Final Review: This game can be worth it if you like a good challenge, this game will test your reflexes to the speed and variations of line patterns!

Because holy sh*t, its controlls seemed utterly busted.Spoilers, they aren't really.This game has a slight amount of lag due to vsync which will affect your play, it will make the controlls seem pretty sloppy and sluggish, that was the reason for the ""this game feels like your spinning around with a sack of potatoes"" comment in my old review (bad grammar intact), I just didn't know it.So does turning vsync off help?Maybe it's confirmation bias but I was immediately able to destroy my old score on the Hexagon stage when it was turned off, so I'd say there's no harm in it.Well I WOULD say there's no harm in it but...ᵗʰᵃᵗ'ᵈ ᵇᵉ ᶫʸᶦᶰᵍ⋅You see, if you're not familiar with what Vsync is, it's a term that stands for Vertical Synchronization, it prevents what is known as tearingwhich looks like this.In my experience, having vsync off in most games is fine but in Super Hexagon this is not the case, in fact Super Hexagon has some of the worst screen tearing I've seen in a video game and this tearing can be quite distracting, I'm not sure if this varies from monitor to monitor but at least in my case I'm pitted with two options: Keep Vsync on and prevent screen tearing and never complete a single stage or turn it off, bite the bullet, and play the game. Thankfully I'm able to eventually ignore what I consider god awful tearing but your experience may vary.What else do I have to say about the game?Well now that I can actually play it and failure feels like my own fault, it's pretty good.The game has a pseudo rhythm game vibe that I can appreciate and the challenge it presents is fun to overcome.I would have more to say but I've only completed the Hexagon stage, I will update this review when I have more knowledge on the game.https://pastebin.com/EucmeE7n"

Keeping this in mind, you nervously select the first mode you see: ""Hexagon,"" or ""Hard"" difficulty. You'll immediately not be able to breathe or blink as your tiny triangle first appears on the screen, mostly likely dying within a few seconds, obliterated against a flashing, rotating wall. Try as you might, you just can't seem to get past the first few seconds of the game. Occasionally you might get lucky and add a few more seconds onto your personal best. All the while, the only thing on your mind is dodging the shapes; nothing else in the world is more engrossing and entrancing when this game sucks you in with its trippy yet simple graphics and absolutely killer 8-bit soundtrack. Eventually you get frustrated enough to quit the game; that annoying female voice reminds you of your defeat with a dismissive ""GAME.

However, if you're like me, you come back the next day to try again. This game, while very daunting at first, becomes much more doable with practice.

Either playing with the keyboard or gamepad you will find that you can never truley judge how far you are goign to move because the movement is never uniform. You will always be over or undershooting where you really think you will be moving. If they nailed the controlls this game would of been epic to master.

It's a game for people that like fast moving games where you need good reaction time. It's very challenging but lots of fun. It can be addicting. Even after beating all 6 levels I still continue to play it. I really like that it's a game where you can load it up and play with it for just a short time and quit again really easily. I also like that you can use either the keyboard or the mouse and the mouse controls are set up so you can play the entire game with one hand never having to touch the keyboard.I really enjoyed this game!! If you like hard fast moving games give it a try!

An Indie game, which although to be honest should probably be marketed as a freeware, is worth a purchase if on sale <1$. The game is essentially you rotating a triangle around a hexagon and dodging lines coming toward you while electronic music plays in the background. The pros are that it is a very simple game and is challenging yet still manages to be enjoyable. However it is a game you will likely only play for minutes at a time. The cons are it is simply too difficult and the controls of rotation are often not precise meaning you depressing the key for what you precieve as the appropriate amount of time to do a 180 degree rotation may over or undershoot you, and the game mechanics make this unforgiving (should be a little more generous to human error). At its core the progression through this game is a memory game, and for that is actually quite enjoyable and I'm sure a workout for your brain as you try to keep all the motions in your head to progress further...also you get gane over a lot. Still recommended, but only for a reduced price."

Or being restrained.Super Hexagon is a simple game about a small triangle revolving around a center hexagon, dodging shards seemingly made of other hexagons. You are the triangle. You cannot touch the shards.As opposed to the original Flash version (which had one level and two colors), Super Hexagon contains six levels, each requiring you to stay alive for one eternity-- er, minute. Oh, and there's more colors.The game is unrelentingly difficult, but oh-so-addicting. The game plays with only two buttons during gameplay, and has several ways of doing so (arrow keys, mouse buttons, gamepad triggers). The game's visuals are psychedelic, color changing and, in the first two levels, seemingly on an axis. You better be darn sure that you're not epileptic or have motion sickness. However, for a person with neither (yours truly), the effect was mesmerizing.The six levels consist of three different levels (Hexagon, Hexagoner, Hexagonest), and then three ""Hyper Mode"" versions, which are faster and with different patterns. Trust me, you WILL work to complete every world.Despite the theoretical six minutes of gameplay that this game would (theoretically) provide, hours will be poured into trying to complete every level... and then some to break your own (or someone else's) high score. Heck, it took me 17 hours to beat a $4 game, and, I tell you, I feel like I need to be locked up on robbery charges at that price.6 levels, 6 sides, 60 seconds. Yep.Also, I legitimately cried at the end. That's actually true.I have never said that a game is perfect before. Even my favorite games that I hold in such high respect still have several flaws which I acknowledge. However, due to the concentrated nature of Super Hexagon's gameplay, it is impossible to find any faults within it. Really.At this point, it sounds like I'm simply ecstatic about the game, and will shout praises and begin handing out brochures about the dangers of other games. The truth it, I feel that everything I wrote here is true. Every last word.Except the beginning joke.Seriously, 10/10 ""would buy again""And yes.  I actually would."

It may even be better than Undertale.Firstly, i'm going to talk about the story, and what an amazing indepth story it is. The characters are all realistic and react like anyone in the real world, the plot is developed at a thoughtful pace obviously being worked on around the clock to perfection, and the villain is just pure evil, I don't think i've wanted a villain to die more than them.Next, the world is amazing. The detail is to the point of being too much, but that is not a bad thing by any mark ande only monsters would ignore the scenery and ""play the game"". On top of this the character desighns and player models (Yes you can customise you character) is more indepth and interessting than any bethesda game's design, from head to toe it is all up to you, the options are endless.Now the only downside in this game is it's sound track, it's not good enough for a game of this level. Yes, i do know that not everyone can be Toby Fox but still, i expected more going into this work of art that what i recieved. The sound track is (at best) a 9/10.Finally- on a more positive characteristic- the game play is fabulous, the way your character moves and attacks is the work of a god everything feels and looks natural using both controller and the mouse/keyboard set-ups. It out performs every game on the market and the fps is stable 420 to boot.In conclusion, I would recommend this game for almost everybody i meet and 80+hours are required if you are to be my friend."

Now if you want to experience true tranquility as this, then look no further than this game.I will sum up some of the story, and try not to give spoilers, then I shall list the positives and the negatives in the space below.Super Hexagon was a Game released by Terry Cavanagh in mid 2016 for Android, iOS, Microsoft Windows, Linux, BlackBerry, and Macintosh OS. This game stars a protagonist by the name of Sir Triangalot. He has been burdened with killing his Parents, as punishment for his crimes he was sent to the ever changing maze of hexagons. You pick up as Sir Triangalot in the first twenty seconds of the game, I think that this is a overall plus because it allows you to get into the character through the story without a lot of exposition that inflicts upon your moral views of this character.  The main kicker for this game is the RPG element, you can really get to know Sir Triangalot over the course of this game by the actions that you do over the span of the game, and there are multiple endings.+ This game has amazing graphics that can draw you into the story and atmosphere of the game.+ Even though there is a small amount of songs in Super Hexagon, each and every one is a masterpiece.+ the controls are really tight and simple to figure out.+ Some of the Battles in this game are really challenging. you could spend hours on a boss to finish it completely. This adds a sense of realism in this game.+Also the unique nature of the battles in Super Hexagon set it aside from the majority of gaming genres.+ The story is compelling enough that you wont want to put is down until the end.+ the game is quite long, and it's a great experience all the way through.- The only Negative I can think of for this game is that it may draw you away from your friends and family because it is so good.All in all as I said up top. This game gets a firm 11/10 from me. I highly recomend that you buy this game. ;)"

One thing to be wary of though is going to be the 'input lag' of your monitor/screen.  Its not a metric that comes up often and isn't something alot of display makers spend much time advertising/promoting.  Its basically the amount of time between when your computer sends a frame to the screen, and when the screen actually shows it to you.  The very best/fastest gaming monitors can have it down to 2-3ms, while the very worst/oldest/slowest ones can be 50-60ms or more.In a game like this, where literally every single millisecond against your reflexes counts, having the right or wrong screen can easily make the difference between making it to the next level and crashing and burning hard on a wall you barely had time to register coming.So yeah, super ultra twitch/reflexes based.  Even still though, the music is catchy enough that its worth a look despite what could ultimately be a very frustrating/demotivating slew of 5 second deaths.(7/10) (One alternative for those without ultra fast reflexes would be to just look up the soundtrack out there)"

,Recommended,221640,32077254,Posted: 30 May,all,<|°_°|>,"TL;DR: Buy this game now, it's like nothing else you'll ever experience when you get in the zone.  When it sucks you in, it feels like there is nothing in the universe except you and Super Hexagon.  It's dirt cheap, so it wouldn't take much to make this game worth your money,  and it goes way above and beyond that standard.  Hard, fast, intense, mind-affecting, satisfying, and addictive - the videogaming meth.In Super Hexagon, you control a tiny arrow, and your sole objective is to dodge increasingly-fast-and-complicated patterns of murderous walls.  Each stage lasts only 60 seconds.  'Survive for one minute?  Easy peasy,' you say.  Not so.  This is probably the hardest game I've ever played, at least as far as sheer difficulty of completion is concerned.This game is crazy difficult, but not in an artificial 'I got you' way, like I Wanna Be the Guy or Dark Souls.  Every time you die, it was *your* fault, and then you mash the spacebar and try again.  And again.  And again.  Sometimes you will be frustrated, you will die 10 seconds in 12 times in a row.  But sometimes... sometimes you get into 'the zone,' that mythical feeling where all other sensations drop out and you become one with the Hexagon.  It's incredible - and I'm not exaggerating here, when you really get absorbed into this game it's like nothing else on planet Earth.  The feeling of finally beating a level you'd been working for ages is incomperable, like a...(Sorry for stealing your joke, Bo Burnham c:)The music is great - intense, upbeat chiptunes - and offers some rhythmic assistance for each level (although maybe that's just me and my musical mind).  There's not much to talk about regarding the graphics - simple, conveys the information it needs to.There's not really anything I would change about this game - 10 hours of gameplay ago I would have asked to please get rid of the fast right-right-left-left-left pattern on the hardes♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ level - but having beaten that stage, I can say that it was I who was the problem, not the game itself.I rate this game 10/10 - meaning that there is nothing I would change about it, it perfectly achieved what it set out to achieve (not necessarily that it is my favorite game of all time, though it's up there)."

Personally, I don't even think this is worth the 2 pounds it is priced at. It is just one of those get rich quick schemes by game designers, which we have seen before where suddenly a dumb game is very addictive. It is the most abnormally frustrating and infuriating game I have ever played, and I mean it.Basically you control a stupid little triangle usingthe left and right arrow keys to dodge incoming lines (refer to trailer) at a very fast speed, in tune to a not very calming soundtrack, which you would expect to hear in a rowdy nightclub. It could be of use in testing your reflexes, but it is simply annoying, especially the monotone female voice who repeatedly says ""Game Over"".If you are still undeterred to buy this game, then I am sorry, but you have problems."

Where you see a blank square hanging on the gallery wall with a dash of red paint, the critics rave about ""the stark presentation contrasting with a bold use of color, challenging the eye and the expectations and slyly satirizing our own feelings of inadequacy."" And so it goes with Super Hexagon. Critics rave about its ""astounding"" minimalism and ""elegance."" That's because they, as sophisticated consumers of media, ""get it,"" and you, Neanderthal that you are, have no taste.Well, as a Neanderthal myself, I found it to be a simplistic and hyperactive waste of time with the production values of an Ed Wood film.On the plus side, the game does bring together some elements of classic gaming: It's got the graphics of Atari's Adventure, the gameplay of Cow Clicker, and the music of a Game Boy game hopped up on meth.Now, I'm not saying that this game isn't for anyone; if you hate the slow, deliberate pacing and deep, complicated story of Wario Ware games, Super Hexagon may be just the game for you.I think I paid 30 cents for it and, at night, those three dimes hover in the air over my bed and torment me with their laughter.There's very little to this game; if this is Super Hexagon, and can only imagine what Hexagon was like."

You can use either the L/R arrow keys/M1, M2 to move your character (The triangle) away from the incoming walls.

In addition, I started getting a headache within about 15 minutes of playing, in part because I was focusing so hard on trying to go the right direction (and failing, and tensing up my shoulders, which caused/worsened the headache, etc.)This is NOT a ""hard-negative"" review (meaning I don't think anyone would enjoy the game), just a ""soft-negative"" to say think about how easily irritated you are, and whether you think focusing on the video full-screen for long periods of time might make your head throb.

And if you've seen the ending without actually beating this game, everything you stand for is a lie.Here's a real tip from a guy who spent eighteen total hours listening to ""game over, begin"": Don't let this game melt your brain. After you've got the patterns down to a stage, and all that's left is pure endurance, take a break after a few good runs before getting back to it. THIS GAME DOES THINGS TO YOU AFTER EXTENDED PERIODS OF TIME. THE PATTERNS ONCE AGAIN BECOME TRICKY AND DISORIENTING IF YOU GO ON CONTINUOUSLY.That is all.

I now know that I will spend countless hours on it in the future, trying to beat all of the levels. I highly recommend it, but ONLY IF YOU ARE AN EXPERIENCED GAMER. This game is EXTREMELY fast paced and you will die many times. If you do not have much experience with gaming, you will rage and yell, and your eyes will hurt. I have been gaming since i was 3, and it hurt my eyes after a while.

,Recommended,221640,12839448,"Posted: 7 November, 2014",all,Obwiana,"This game is good, but it's beyond infuriating. You're constantly getting things thrown at you nonstop. There's not a single moment where you can rest and relax unless it was right after you got killed. This game seems to shift between forcing you to focus on what's coming toward you, and muscle memory depending on what patterns are coming your way. Shifting between these mindsets constantly seriously makes me feel like my brains going to implode.I enjoy this game, but I also hate it. It's fun to kill some time to at first, but eventually it grates your nerves.Even though this game is probably going to surface some anger issues I didn't know I had, it's still good enough to be worth full price. It's very satisfying to be able to reach your next goal, even if you're not very good. Dying sucks in this game, but once you start bettering yourself and reaching more and more outstanding milestones, you'll feel like you've accomplished something worthwhile, even though you really haven't (I mean, it's just a high score in a game).The soundtrack is actually extremly good. It fits the game's flashy colors and quick gameplay and it makes it sound like your in a retro rave. There are enough songs to keep the sound from getting too repetitive, but it does have the tendency to distract you, and distraction is something you can't have when playing this game. Hell, I don't think I even blink.The character is cute too. I don't know what it is about being a Hexagon and taking control of a small arrow, but for some reason, it just adds a much needed ""d'aww factor""."

This is one of the most punishingly difficult games I've ever played, but I might be a masochist, which would explain why I love this game so much.

This is because they don't know what to do (even though there is a short little preparation tutorial when first-time playing the first stage), panics at the weird walls creeping towards the center hexagon, and gets dizzy at the fast and changing spinning.Easy to master (not really), is because once you figure out how to play the game (like recognizing the patterns), the game then becomes a meditation acid trip into awesome music.So in short, it's a patience game. Very small (hence the price), but with high replay value. Trust me, you'll be wanting to try to beat the stage (60 seconds/stage, 3 normal and 3 ""hyper"" stages), beat your personal record, or compete with your Steam friends over and over and over again.If you have a strong sense of direction, love 8-bit chiptune music (it's Chipzel, btw), good patience, and strong determination, then try this game out!

It forces you to learn a bit about yourself, the way you think and perceive, and how to know, work within, and expand your own limits.  It will frustrate you, and frustration makes it impossible to play, which means you will get practice in calming yourself down; this is good for you.The game never screws you outright; every single time you die it's entirely your own fault.Super Hexagon is gaming in a primal form made for modern audiences. There's no gear grinding, no character that gets better to make the game easier for the player, no broken mechanics to exploit, or broken builds or strategies to figure out.It's you, and only you, vs the game."

You move your triangular player marker through tunnels of receding trapezoids around a hexagon center until you eventually hit a wall. Though the visuals are simple, this is one of the hardest reflex-based games I've ever played. Though the game is amazingly hard, the incredible music that doesn't get on your nerves the literal thousandth time you've heard it and the compelling feeling to play ""just one more round"" keep the game from getting old quickly. If you are to survive a full minute of disorienting, shifting, spinning, flashing and turning, you unlock harder levels for you to try and overcome. This is a wonderful game to play if you've got 5 minutes with nothing to do, or are hoping for a real challenge. The game gets so hard, it's more than likely you will not beat the final level. It's so ludicrously fast,  that unless you are obsessive and/or masochistic, you'll probably never have the patience to beat it.

The lines approach in patterns that require quick-tapping and ruthless attention to avoid.Don’t expect much of a tutorial. Super Hexagon throws you right in to this relentless polygonal gauntlet with three available modes from the start – Hard, Harder and Hardest. Each mode progresses through stages based on geometric shapes every 15 seconds. Last a minute in any mode and an even-harder hyper version unlocks.This game is a throwback that ’s going to be alienating if you believe a game should reward you for anything other than earning each and every inch of your progress. You’ll start by surviving 5 seconds at a time, then 10, then 30 – and finally you’ll hit 60 seconds and feel more completion than you get from some 100 hour RPGs. The experience is incredibly addictive – especially when you’re in the zone.The simplicity is so beautiful there’s little to complain about. The vibrant colors, hypnotic shapes and thumping music (comprised of expertly crafted chiptunes by Chipzel) combine to create a game that’s as much art as it is a compelling play experience.If there’s a single thing that’s going to bother you throughout Super Hexagon (besides the difficulty) it’s likely that any notification will throw off your session, sometimes ruining an epic run. Still, you’ll be upset for about a second – the play sessions go so quickly you’ll barely notice."

It is a fun little indie game that makes you rage but also makes you feel satisfied! The objective of the game is just to dodge these large hexagons and every 10 seconds (or so...) it changes a bit and makes it more challenging and faster, on the whole I highly recommend this game if you don't mind swearing once or twice!

76561198067205961,Recommended,221640,18364479,"Posted: 6 October, 2015",all,Ska-panzia,"As I played Pokémon Alpha Sapphire and Omega Ruby, my memories of certain trainers’ one-liners and their Pokémon teams came rushing back from my time with the original Pokémon Sapphire and Ruby in 2002. Experiencing this classic role-playing game again in beautified 3D was truly a nostalgic trip, from the cute friendship-themed plot to the touching end-credits sequence. However, as a remake, it does represent a big missed opportunity to fix several significant balance issues and mechanical problems — the difficulty I had going back after playing the much more modern Pokémon X shows how far Pokémon games have come in 12 years.For the uninitiated, Ruby and Sapphire were the third installments in the Pokémon RPG series and the best-selling Game Boy Advance games of all time. They follow the tried-and-true Pokémon model of journeying to catch new monsters, challenging eight boss-like Gyms, and eventually fighting the Elite Four trainers and the Champion. Like most other Pokémon games they also put you at odds with a villainous team of Pokémon trainers, in this instance Team Magma for Ruby and Team Aqua for Sapphire, who want to use legendary Pokémon to forever change the region of Hoenn, where the games are set.Now they’re the first of the earlier games to receive the 3D treatment. Generation III was a big change from the first two for many reasons, most notably the introduction of Abilities (attributes that add advantages to battle, among other things), Natures (which affect how stats develop) and double battles (using two Pokémon at once was unheard of back in the day). Different areas had their own weather patterns, and the region contained varied topography, from a desert to a volcano to sandy beaches.In 2002 I reveled in the newness and feel of having an untouched world to explore, and that sense of wonder carries over in Omega and Alpha. The scenery is rich, the adorable characters are even more adorable (especially little Wally!), and there’s more to many of the cities than there was before. I walked into Mauville City for the first time while playing Alpha and didn’t even recognize it. In the original games it was comparatively small and boasted only the bike shop and the Game Corner, but now it’s like a smaller Lumiose City from X and Y: full of little shops and tons of NPCs to chat with. I actually got lost in Mauville City more than once, and had a lot of fun rediscovering something I thought I knew well.Alpha and Omega also bear some resemblance to X and Y in that certain app-like features — Pokémon Amie, Super Training, the Player Search System — have all been integrated as part of the PokéNav Plus. The interface is overcrowded as a result and really cumbersome, but the online apps are welcome additions (especially Wonder Trade) It’s the new Pokémon search app, the DexNav, that is perhaps the most interesting addition for Poképhiles. Every so often, a wild Pokémon will peek its ears or tail out of the tall grass (or sand or water), and DexNav will alert you to things like the Pokémon’s level, ability, and even rare moves it might have. I found two Poochyena this way: a female with Ice Fang and a male with Poison Fang, two “egg moves” that you can usually only get by carefully breeding. Easy-access breeding material! The app has the potential to help EV trainers as well, since you can see what Pokémon you’ll face before you battle it, and in that regard it provides another alternative to Super Training aside from traditional, less-accessible methods.There’s also an updated Berry map, first introduced in Gen IV, which is a serious help to anyone who needs Berries for competitive battle... or even Pokéblocks! Remember Pokéblocks? They help your Pokémon up their beauty or cuteness or what have you for Contests, which are of course a part of Alpha and Omega. These Pokémon talent shows have a Japanese pop-idol feel this time, which makes it all seem more modern and updated. Playing as the female trainer, I was literally and figuratively taken under the wing of number-one Contest star Lisia and her Altaria, Ali. Lisia is absolutely adorable, but the best part of Contests for me is undoubtedly the Cosplay Pikachu you receive after winning your first one. Change Pikachu’s outfit according to the five Contest attributes and Pikachu gets a different move! I might just be a super nerd, but it’s the best thing since Surfing Pikachu.Really, all the tweaks of original Hoenn features are improvements. Unfortunately, there are still a few big flaws that weren’t addressed, and they’re even more noticeable in light of more recent Pokémon RPGs. My least favorite part of every Pokémon game is the unnecessary inclusion of too many hidden moves, commonly referred to as HMs (Hidden Machines), which you must teach to your Pokémon in order to progress through the region and aren’t so easily unlearned. Anything more than Surf and Fly is too much, as far as I’m concerned, and Hoenn is one of the worst HM offenders. Alpha and Omega dropped Flash for a total of seven HMs this time around — and in the late-game you can summon Latias or Latios to fly you places, which means you won’t need a Pokémon in your team with Fly — but compared to X and Y’s five HMs, it’s obvious why the decision was made to pare them back in subsequent games.Secret Power factors into this too. It isn’t an HM, but it is another move that interacts with the overworld and is necessary for building Super Secret Bases. Maybe I’m just stingy with what moves I teach my Pokémon, but I wish I didn’t need a move at all to check out potential bases during my travels. That aside, having a home base I could decorate in 3D was a lot of fun, and sharing via StreetPass or setting it up for other players to fight through as a mini-Gym are both neat touches.It’s not a new complaint, but Hoenn is still imbalanced type-wise, heavily favoring water. It’s especially noticeable in Alpha Sapphire, in which Team Aqua (the villains of the piece) use a lot of water types. It feels like there are water Pokémon in nearly every battle, and I have an overleveled Pikachu to show for it. You also have to navigate many bodies of water, since much of the late-game involves the HMs Surf and Dive to get from place to place. Diving was really neat back in 2002 when it was new, but I found it incredibly tedious in Alpha and Omega — an obvious example of how superfluous some HMs are.The water itself is absolutely gorgeous with the new graphics and details, though. One of my favorite parts of the entire adventure was splashing through puddles that reflected the starry skies at night, and even diving was made better by seeing a school of Luvdisc swimming by. Building my Super Secret Base on the rainy Route 119 had an extra-comfy, drinking-tea-on-a-rainy-day feel. Everything in Hoenn, water or not, is either delightfully cute or strikingly beautiful, and I enjoyed seeing the entire region anew — despite the tediousness associated with navigating all that pretty water.The VerdictAs a 3D remake, Pokémon Alpha Sapphire and Omega Ruby do a fantastic job of reintroducing Hoenn. Little details, like characters turning their heads to look as you pass or flocks of Wingulls flying overhead, make the region really come to life, and small updates and tweaks help make the journey smoother. Still, a few of its flaws are even more glaring in 3D, especially the excess water Pokémon and often dull navigation of their habitats. The added online features could help mitigate some of the"

If you gave up on the ""Veni Vidi Vici"" trinket in VVVVVV, this isn't for you. Even if you've done those, only the first two stages in this are for ANYONE.I really can't support a game that, I feel, was designed to be practically unbeatable. And I really believe the Hyper stages in this were. In that sense this game is a lot like Kaizo Mario World. Except, without savestates. Yeah. That doesn't sound fun, does it? That being said, the ""Hexagon"" and ""Hexagoner"" levels (the first two of six) are very playable and very fun. The other four though... jeez. Good luck with that.Also, I don't like how flashy the graphics are. The spinning and zooming and panning and twisting and flashing make this already hard game impossible. Too often you can't keep track of yourself. It's just like BIT.TRIP BEAT, except, missing one beat in that doesn't equal game over.Watch gameplay videos of it first, and really think to yourself, ""could I survive in that for more than 30 seconds, ever?""

This isn't your average rage game. This is a game that was created by the sick, sadistic mind of gaming's Satan himself, Terry Cavanagh. Now before you start writing death threats to him on his Twitter, or whatever, he isn't a bad person... He just has a sick sense of humor. His previous creation, VVVVVV, is a game, I highly recommend, and if you wanna hear what I have to say about it, just look at my review on it when I actually write it. But anyways, enough rambling. The game starts off with three levels. Hexagon: Hard Mode, Hexagoner: Harder Mode, and Hexagonest: Hardest mode. But there's three other levels to unlock. To unlock these levels, as well as beat the level itself, you have to survive getting hit by parts of a hexagon that twist around, and even change the shape of the hexagon itself ranging to a pentagon, and a square. But that's only in Hexagon. But anyways, you have to guide a little triangle (you) around these obstacles so you don't die. But you have to do this for at least 60 seconds to unlock the hyper level (essencially the hard mode of the level), and beat the level itself. Sounds simple, right? NO. It's simplistic nature throws you into a brick wall when you actually get into the game itself. Now let me be frank. This game is not bad by any means, but if you have a lack of patience, DO. NOT. GET. THIS. GAME. Otherwise, go ahead."

The music actually matches what you need for escape patterns. It's hard to describe. I can't get past 47 seconds though! Good if you can get it for less then $3 and good for a game where you need almost zero committment to play much.

The system of moving your triangle around the hexagon works well enough but there is no feedback in the movement so the screen backgrounds rapidly accelerating and spinning makes it incredibly difficult to not overshoot or undershoot by just tapping the keys. The spinning of the screen as well is it's own problem as making things difficult to see is not a fun concept of challenge, merely difficulty created by poor design. In my opinion, throwing unrelenting challenges at you and then making them hard to differentiate, then make it purposefully hard to dodge said challenges on your own skill and knowledge of the patterns is not good design.In short, any game where you have every pattern memorized and every movement known just to die because the screen decided to have a trip on a roundabout at 90MPH is not challenging, it's frustrating and not fun to overcome."

I wanted to like this game, since it is very popular, has good music, and was made by Terry Cavanagh, creator of VVVVVV. However, the gameplay is too minimalistic. You retry the same level over and over, memorizing patterns, and almost nothing changes each time. You know what DOES change every time you die though? Your position. Your position is practically the only thing that doesn't reset when you die. However, if it was moving when you died, it will stay in that position, and will be annoyingly offset. Rarely, it may even make the game unplayable, causing you to become stuck on an angle that make some level configurations literally impossible. And by rarely, I mean in terms of death, not time, so considering the amount of times you will die, it is actually quite common. I probably experienced an instance of that within my first few minutes of playing. Seriously, there are plenty of other games that have insane levels of difficulty, with more satisfaction as well."

I'm a big fan of hard games, I've got over 24 hours on Geometry Dash but I just CAN'T play Super Hexagon.The controls are slippery like Disney on Ice, you can't see three nanometers infront of you and the constant vibrating makes me want to vomit.I don't even get motion sickness but the vibrating and rotating is just annoying as ♥♥♥♥. It adds to the difficulty and takes away your soul.A good hard game should always make you feel like it was YOUR fault when you died. I can't get that feeling when a wall closes right in front of my ♥♥♥♥ing nose or when the controls decide to flip me over in the middle of the game.Difficult for the sake of being difficult.The learning curve for this game is basically this: ""OK, let's begin.. here's an obstacle. ♥♥♥♥ you.""The music is pretty alright though. I actually think it's way better to just buy the soundtrack instead of the game.I give this game a solid Seizure/10. Maybe if I sacrifice enough baby lambs I can make it past the first level.EDIT: I made it past the first level. Now it's time to sacrifice more baby lamb hearts to the Aztec Sun Gods to beat the ♥♥♥♥ing Hyper mode or whatever.  - 8.7.2017"
,Not Recommended,221640,25631896,"Posted: 22 September, 2016",all,D YellowMadness,"I like the concept & the difficulty & I beat the first difficulty level in about 40 minutes. What I don't like is that the hardest patterns are so rare & random that you're more likely to win by replaying until those patterns don't come up than you are to win by getting good enough to deal with those patterns. It's like playing Slow Ride in Guitar Hero 3 with a random chance of having to suddenly play random riffs from The Devil Went Down to Georgia.The second worst thing about this game is the difficulty spikes. You'll likely find yourself beating some levels in seconds but getting stuck on other levels for a few dozen minutes or more.

The main problem is that its difficulty comes mostly from the slippery controls. A game that demands such precision from the player should have flawless controls. It's just not there. It is way too sensitive. The slightest tap on the keyboard (or gamepad, I tried both) sends the arrow flying.Also the fact that the screen keeps changing colors and rotating doesn't help much. It is a gimmicky distraction to the gameplay. This is ""hard"" in the sense that driving with someone constantly covering your eyes is ""hard"". It's pointless. It feels like the developer wants players to fail as a means to an end. As if he wanted to make a very hard game, even though not a very enjoyable one.So in the end what you have is an exercise in frustration. This game is a prime example of a great idea executed very poorly. A little more care and this could have easily been a classic. I'd suggest anyone looking for a hard game to play Super Meat Boy or even 1001 Spikes."

The tiny peripheral field of vision, jumpiness, quasi-random generation, absolutely no checkpoints within level, random rotation switches and splitting/joining points when the field switches to pentagon or such makes this frustrating without equivalent reward for me.  Hard for all the wrong reasons.  And while it certainly is addictive, it is not fun. There is way too much, ""grinding"" if you will, if what you need to practice (since that's what the game requires in a bad way) usually shows up in the latter part of a level but you have no problem with what's before, you'll still need to spend the full time doing everything before for most attempts.In other words, this forces you to practice to win or progress (not a bad thing in of itself), but with no practice mode or way of isolating problem events, it forces you into the worst kind of practice habit possible.  Certain events tend to show up later (or earlier but if all the difficult events showed up in the beginning it woulnd't matter) in level, therefore making isolatating the problem event and for most attempts wasting your time grinding the same beginning sections which  over and over, which numbs the mind and causes you to perform worse on everything fairly quickly.I would be interested to see in the code how fast exactly what your maximum and mimimum required reaction times would be in a number of the situations it generates based on your best-or-worst-case prior positioning (based significantly because of the random generation engine).On top of this, some of the music (first level) isn't that good.If you don't mind being frustrated and spending an inordinate amount of time practicing something that isn't fun and likely has no relevance elsewhere, get this game."

,Not Recommended,221640,12193305,"Posted: 22 September, 2014",all,Fargin Noob,"Overall, I have three complaints about the game: 1) the collision detection on your cursor is imprecise, leading to situations where you die when you're ""on"" the line, even though you're to the correct side; 2) the randomness of everything means that you're not really getting better as much as you are hoping for a randomly generated pattern that is easy to navigate; and 3) the controls are not really as good as they should be for the twitchiness of the game.On point number three, specifically using left or right to move isn't fast enough if you go the wrong way. You have the option, for instance, to go left or right around a hexagonal block to reach the open space, but that is a false choice because the speed of the collision blocks vs the speed of the cursor is such that you can only make it the shortest distance. That's a problem. Further, there's a vast imprecision about where your cursor ends leading quite often to problem number 1. Had there been some lead up to the difficulty the game starts at to give you a good feel for the cursor speed, that might be one thing, but there's not.I have a hard time recommending the game. Its gameplay is shallow, and the controls aren't tight enough to allow for the difficulty curve it's asking for. The two best things going for the game are the quick replayability (no loading screens, etc.), and the excellent chiptune soundtrack.One final note: there are no cards for the game, and that's severely disappointing considering how simple the game is."

While an interesting and fun game for a short while, after many, many attempts at puzzling out its psuedo-random nature, it is easy to see that most of its difficulty is fake.Now, this isn't ""This game is stupidly hard! It must be fake difficulty!"" claims. The game's challenge is genuinely fake, involving random changing speeds and directions of rotations, (mostly) unpredictable, radical changes in the playing field, and an obscenely small margin of error. Altogether, this makes Super Hexagon more an excercise in tenacity and repitition than a challenging, rewarding puzzler.Avoid the game, unless you enjoy constant interface screws and ball-busting unforgivability hidden under excellent music and a simplistic, but charming, interface."

Simple.I like the concept, but in practice, this game is just an irritating mess. The controls make it very difficult to get the icon to move where you want it. I think this is mainly because you cannot move at variable speeds (like you could in classic games like Tempest), so overshooting and undershooting happens frequently. The controls also seem a bit unresponsive, making the problem even worse. Whatever the reason, over/undershooting leads to smashing into a wall and instantly ending the game, interrupting the fun with a jarring ""GAME OVER"" voice and punishing the player by forcing a complete restart.No, thanks.Even at less than $1, this game is a waste of money.

Your goal as the triangle is to avoid the incoming shapes as they approach the hexagon and are absorbed into it. If they touch you, the game ends. While this may seem an innocent setup, the hexagon's six sides, six stages within each game mode, and six game modes within the game are anything but an innocent coincidence. In reality, the player as the triangle is caught in a nightmare realm, where the Devil, whose mouth is the hexagon, feeds on the lesser shapes and lines that approach It, which the player must avoid for as long as they can, for if the player is hit by one, they are pushed by it right into the six-sided mouth of the Devil.Like Tetris, this game is unwinnable and only allows you to hold off your inevitable defeat, implying that the Devil is an all-powerful figure who will inevitably ""eat"" us all. This is not truthful by any stretch of the imagination, but unfortunately those who do not see the game for what it is may gradually come to believe it.The only redeeming aspect of this game is its music, and even that is purposed to lure the untrained mind into a trance so that it remains blind to the evil scheme in front of it. Please avoid this game at all costs and spread the word in your youth groups so nobody else falls victim to this manifestation of the Devil's handiwork."

Various obstacles converge towards the center of the hexagon, and you have to dodge them. Also, the screen spins around while you play. There are 6 difficulty levels; you start out with the first three, Hexagon, Hexagoner, and Hexagonest, then you unlock the hyper version of each difficulty level once you've survived for a minute in that difficulty. It sounds very simple, but it's actually extremely hard. Most people can only last 3 seconds starting out. This doesn't deter most people, though; as you play, you'll start to recognize patterns and work out how to dodge everything. It can keep you playing for a long time, due to multiple difficulty levels and constantly trying to beat your high score.

,Recommended,221640,8597633,"Posted: 6 January, 2014",all,MetaWaddleDoo,"It's very rare to see a game as simple as Super Hexagon feel like such a fresh experience.  I can't remember the last time I've enjoyed a game this much, either.  Most of my time spent playing games is just used to forget about the sorrow of my sad, pathetic excuse for an existence.  But when I turned on Super Hexagon, some light bulb turned on inside of me.  One that had been turned off since I was a little child.  I was having so much fun playing this game.  I couldn't put it down, and I couldn't stop thinking about it when I wasn't home.In the game, you control a little cursor that moves around a hexagon.  Press right to move clockwise, and left to move counter-clockwise.  That's all there is to the controls.  The purpose of the game is to dodge incoming lines moving towards the hexagon and to stay alive as long as possible.  There's 3 different levels at first, appropriately labeled as 'Hard', 'Harder', and 'Hardest'.  You can unlock 'Hyper' versions of these levels after reaching the 60 second mark in a stage.At a first glance, the game seems like it'll be relatively easy.  And then you die right away.  And then you say to yourself ""Crap... I can do better than that.""  And then you die again.  You repeat this process for about an hour, and realize that you still haven't gotten further than 10 seconds.  You curse the gods and the heavens, go pace around for a bit, and then come back and repeat the process all over again for another hour.  And then somehow you've reached 60 seconds and feel like you have the reflexes of a god.  And even after beating all of the levels, I still can't put this game down.  The game is just so much fun at it's core that I keep playing to try and get better times on each stage.I should also mention that the music in this game is incredible.  There's only 3 tracks, one for each stage, but they're implemented in a way that helps keep them from being too repetitive.  Whenever you restart a level, the game starts the track from one of three different spots, somewhat giving the player the illusion of progression.  And each song seems to have one melody that only pops up when you're 30 seconds to 60 seconds into a level.  This helps build up tension your first time through, as the music becomes unfamiliar right as you're getting close to beating the level.If you're the kind of gamer who feels like a game should have a lot of content and things to see, then avoid this game.  You can see 50% of what this game has to offer in approximately 30 seconds.  If you have a little bit of imagination, then pretend the 3 stages you played spin faster and have different background colors.  You've now seen 100% of what the game has to offer, all within less than a minute.  But, if you're a gamer who feels like a game isn't finished until you've completely mastered it, then prepare for hours and hours of fun with Super Hexagon.  This is a game in it's purest form.  No fluff.  No story.  No handholding.  Just... a ♥♥♥♥ing game.  Something that is now exceedingly rare."

,Recommended,221640,8420587,"Posted: 29 December, 2013",all,MalkDuds,"For such a simple game, Super Hexagon has incredible replayability.  The concept is simple: make your character (a triangle) dodge the incoming lines.  These walls are coming to the center of the screen from the outside, and all you have to do is dodge left or right.Easier said than done.  Hop right into the easiest difficulty, which is Hard (also named Hexagon).  Each mode has a hyper mode that is unlocked when you survive for 60 seconds.  Good luck getting there on Hexagonest.The challenge of this game is very simple, and thus can be very relaxing, if you just sit back, let loose, and don't take it seriously.  Test your perception, reaction time and reflexes, and sensitivity as each mode increases the speed your triangle moves as well as how fast the lines come in at you.This game can be incredibly fun if you like challenges.  The challenge of it is somewhat like the bullet hell shooters, but more satisfying and less overwhelming.  Definitely much easier with a controller, though."

,Recommended,221640,774492,"Posted: 2 April, 2013",all,Ultralord,"This game is just plain old hard. It provides an extreme challenge, while keeping the actuall graphics simple. Let me start off by explaining the game. You, a subject of an over extreme mind experiment, are part of a line to g oin the arena. In the arena you must swerve your way around your enemys, who are quiet dumb if I may say so. Most don't make it through the first 3 seconds of a round start, literally. Now can you prove to beat this huge challenge and bring home the Hexagons? Now that that's out of the way, lets get to the gameplay. The distractions, there are so many distractions. The screen spins, there a multible colors to confuse you, and the speed of the triangle is awkward. This creates a thrilling, action packed, quick atmosphere. The graphics, are not that hard to recreate. Simple shapes that are polished to fit the theme, and the simplicity help the game. Overall, this game is simple, proves a challenge, and is actually rewarding after you beat the first 10 seconds, it's a great game. I can't find anything wrong about it besides the players that play it. 9.5/10 Since I cant be sure if this game is not without the few bugs."

This game tests your cognitive function. While you have to dodge the lines by moving the arrow with the arrow keys, the game is throwing colors, flashes, patterns, changes of direction and so many things at you to try and make you fail. The music is amazing and it helps you to go past all the hoards of things coming at you. After playing this game the words ""Game Over"" will be nothing but two words to you. Beating this is a challenge and you could spend HOURS trying to beat it and you still wont succed. I highly reccomend this game to all players out there."

Everything it does should make me hate it, but I just straight up enjoy it. Maybe it's the music. Maybe it's the knowledge that I am in fact getting better at it (as reflected by my best time), or maybe it's that everyone thinks I'm some kind of god when I can survive for more than ten seconds on the hardest level (hardes♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ I think).The music is amasing, and is what I found myself coming back to this game for. And once you play a  more difficult level, the easier ones are much, much easier. I have spent over 33 hours in this game, because I also own it on android (which is harder than PC for some reason).In case you didn't get it, this game is really hard. You are a tiny triangle that can move around the outside of a hexagon. You either go left, or right. As you do, there are falling 'blocks' that will squish you if they catch you inbetween themselves and the hexagon you are travelling around. These blocks only fall where a side of the hexagon is. Dodging them can be very tricky, but the game is distracting. Watch the trailer if you don't believe me. It spins, it changes colour, it warps and zooms in and out all the time. Try and keep track while you die."

You move a triangle around a hexagon while trying to dodge Shapes coming at you, while the camera is spinning and changing directions, the screen pulsates, and the flashing lights.  I got through the first and second level, but the 3rd is physically impossible for me, only unless I get REALLY lucky, for the reason being, I can't exactly see all the shapes coming at me when they are so close together at times and they look like the same thing for my eyes :P.  I wouldn't recommend this to a person that is sensitive to light, or has a history of Epilepsy or Seizures (For the harder levels; It goes quite crazy) since the flashing lights and such.

I like the soundtrack and the game is much easier if you can get into the music. You'll find it's very much like a dance and the environment reacts to the music. Beating that first level will have you screaming and cheering. Your heart will race when you beat your personal best of 10 seconds and enter into the unknown.  Eventually you will move on to the next level. Then the song changes, the effects change, and the dance changes. This game has rage quit written all over it, and it happens often.

You have to avoid the deadly, flashy lines coming at you. But it is hard, and discouraging. You must keep trying.The music is amazing. There are tthree really epic chiptune tracks, one for each level. Everytime you start a level a different part of the song plays, to keep you interested.There are only a few cons I can think of. The first is that it's very hard to learn, and will easily discourage many players.Secondly, the sounds in game are very annoying. You are constantly hearing 'begin' and 'game over' everytime you die. Also, every 10 or 15 seconds you get to be told what level of the level you are on; 'line' 'triangle' 'square' 'pentagon' 'hexagon'.And if you turn vsync off to save yourself from input lag, the visuals becomes very choppy, might be better on powerful PCs.Overall it's not bad, but many things could be done better. 8/10.Conflicted about this game?If the sounds are bothering you, go into the game's folder on your hard drive and replace the offending sounds with blank sound files. If you don't like the music, you can replace it (look up guide here on steam).If it's too hard, look up some guides. Super Hexagon 101 is the most useful.If 2.99 is too much for an awesome game, go try Open Hexagon. It's the same concept, just free and open-soure."

This game is a work of art; a brilliantly terrifying work of art that feels like an overdose of adrenaline every time you play it (probably caused by all the adrenaline you get from playing it).

Use of it can and will train you thouroughly in several skills that are so completely inapplicable to real life that whence you enter the game, you won't have them at all.This game is for you is you are willing to work for it - the level of fun isn't quite Dwarf Fortress, but boy golly is it ever *not* casual. The gameplay is sparse, and uncomplicated. The controls are simple, and highly responsive. But each jump in difficulty is definitely a *jump*: if you completed the last level, you will still die quite a bit on the next one.Subjectively, each additional level feels about 1.5x harder than the last; with major difficulties being the first three levels, and the last level. The fourth and fifth levels are just faster variations of levels one and two with a unique piece (pattern to dodge) thrown in. The sixth level is aalso like this, but is *so* much faster that the difficulty spike is markedly harder.To put this in perspective, at the time of writing this review, I've broken into the top 5000 players on Level 4, I'm in the top 8000 for level five, and I *still* have not even beaten level six (beating a level is survivng for 60 seconds).So... yep. Definitely a bit harder than the other two.Beyond gameplay, the only other thing that bears comment is the soundtrack. In two words: exquisite chiptunes. The artist responsible for this music, Chipzel, composes the music on the sound chips of Nintendo Gameboys - the handhelds that came out in 1989, not the later ones - and then augments it in a more modern environment. A pleasure to listen to if you like that kind of thing. If not, there are several guides written by members of the community on how to change or disable the music.Overall, 11/10 permutohedrons are awesome. You will hate this game if you can't take failure; you will love it if you love having to fight for every iota of success."

The gameplay is not like any other game I've played. You rotate around whatever the current shape is and try to avoid the oncoming lines. You have to snap back and forth, rotate in time, or zig zag your way around them to progress. While doing this, the game can ♥♥♥♥ with you, but it's in a good way. Colors change and the whole field can warp and rotate itself which adds to the difficulty, and, in my opinion, the fun. Not to mention the amazing music which is sort of techno-ish mixed with 8bit music. All in all a great deal. Especially for the price point."

The fact that the music ties in with what's happening on screen makes it so much better. If you lose, you press a button or two and you just restart.

The difficulty is right where it should be.That isn't to say that this game is perfect. The main reason for this is that the gameplay is repetitive, to say the least.

Start up the game, dance in your chair to the sick music, only to have it pause 4.23 seconds later at a game over screen.I'm a bit of a sore loser, but I wasn't sore about losing on this game; just like alot of classic arcade games, this game demands twitch reflexes, acute spatial recognition, and some good ol' muscle memory to progress further. The joy brought by each miniscule progression further into the game and the music; 8.62 seconds, 10.46 seconds... It's like setting a new record on a classic arcade game.Turn on Arcade Mode, where everyone competes to put their name in the list of top times, and Super Hexagon IS a classic arcade game, just envisioned in another age. Nostalgia, anyone? Start this up at a party with a controller, and you'll have people crowding for a try, like back in the day at an arcade, or at the very least bouncing to the beats, like Guitar Hero.The challenge this game provides scratches an itch I haven't been able to get to for quite some time, and with the ridiculously low price tag, the purchase is a no-brainer.

Let me say that it is a b**** to play. However, it's a fun b****, I must say.Controls are very simple. Go left and right. That's it. All you have to do is dodge every obstacle for 60 seconds. Definitely sounds easier than it seems, because those 60 seconds will be the longest in your ENTIRE LIFE. My favourite level has to be Hexagonestest. It's really challenging, but not overly frustrating like it's predecessor, Hexagones♥♥♥♥♥♥♥-the last level. It's also very nice in the contrast of color, making it nice to actually see the friggin' triangle.I used to play the Impossible Game on the PS3, and lemme tell you-this is much harder. It will throw attacks like you ain't ever seen before-sometimes going upwards to a 5-succession combo. What's even harder is how unlike the Impossible Game, the attacks are completely unpredictable. Yet, the hardest part is to keep at least %90 percent focused on the game. Why not %100? Well, if you're %100 focused, you're brain leaves reality, which-even in a game like this-is not good. You want to keep 90% focused on the game, while keeping %5 towards the keys you're using, and the other %5 towards reality. It's hard, but possible. Takes you maybe 500+ tries to complete Hexagones♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ (like I did), but it's SO worth it.Is it fun? Yes.Is it hard? F*CK YES.Is it worth buying for bragging rights? Oh, totally worth the $5.~I bought the expansion pack. ;PThis game for me receives a 12/10 for it's challenging levels, sheer frustration levels, and the level of ""OMFG"" after you've beaten the game.

After you play it the first time, you will keep playing for one of two reasons:1.You want to beat your new pathetic record2.You can't stand the fact that you still haven't beat your pathetic recordBuy this game only if you can accept defeat. If you can't, you should still buy it. This game will make hours seem like seconds. You will have fun. You will be confused. You will be angry. You will cuss. You will send your fist at your monitor.

So far so good, I only got one level...the first one.Maybe something a bit bad from this game is, in fact, the color pattern and the movement: in the first level it's alright, even in the third one, but the second level is just a killer: the color, even dark, flashes everywhere, and since I usually get migraines from things like this, it stops me from trying the second level long enough to win it.But hey, in the better days I still try it.Game for those minutes where you have nothing to do, and you're bored: it'll make you either rage quit, or laugh."

Simplicity has never been so fun; alll you have to do is move a cursor through gaps created by the objects closing in on you. Some may see it as a waste of time where you get nothing out of it other than satisfaction for mastering something that will never help you again, but I disagree. Throughout the journey of beating hexagon to hexagones♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, your mind tends to wander as you continuously lose. Whenever I want to relax, I play this game. The only rage i experienced was when it lost all my records after I had unlocked all the hyper modes so I had to rebeat hexagonest, which is has no right to have as high sensitivity as it does when everything else moves so slowly! But eh, no need to whine.Definitely a 10/10 for me.IMPORTANT - After looking at some other peoples reviews regarding the controls as being too sensitive, I want to say that YOU ARE WRONG. The sensitivity being the way it is makes the game challenging, if you could control the speed you are going, it would be too easy. That's why it's challenging."

The harder levels are so fast that you at first can't see what is happening. Eventually your brain adapts and what was before incomprehensible turns into slow motion. And then you start the next one...After completing this play some Open Hexagon (download Hexadorships level pack with the rubber levels). OH is free but the default easier levels aren't that fun so play Super Hexagon first.

If you want to get anywhere in this game, you need every single ounce of gaming prowess you have in your body, your friends' bodies and your whole family. And that's just for the easiest difficulty ""Hexagon"". Your reactions have to be perfect, but if you watch for your reactions to be fast enough, you're unable to see what's coming. So it's like ""Pick your poison""...This game has some redeeming factors though. First, the gameplay is ""easy"" to learn, as it only requires three buttons. Left to move left, right to move right. What's the third button? Enter to reset after you die again and again and again (insert endless loop of me saying ""and again"")...Secondly, the music, oh damn, the music. Superb fast-paced techno/electronic with lots of bass and synth put to use. I would praise it even more... if it didn't distract so much from the barriers you're running into while being into the music.Third and last, the visuals. They are simplistic and flashy, perfectly complementing the techno beat, making this game super-addicting just to see the flashy graphics and hear the soundtrack.- - - - - - - - - -Final conclusion:Difficulty: 9001/10Presentation: 7/10Addictive: Definitely, you will play for hours straight (if you can keep yourself from ragequitting)- - - - - - - - - -So, considering all that was said, this game is very addictive and fun, despite the difficulty.

Everytime you get to 60 seconds to beat the current you have the sense of completion as it took you over 1,000 tries to finish and when that 100 second comes along you feel like a legend within the game but the game does get intensily harder as you go higher and higher.This game gives a great sense of panic in yourself as you thought you could make it but that one little pixel got you or that time your heart starts to beat faster and faster as you close in on your high score. It's very fast which is why most people say ""Don't Blink or you Die"" that is very much true some of the later difficulty seconds you can blink (unless you can blink fast enough) and you will certainly regret doing so.You will hear the words, ""Game Over... Again"" many times over, it never gets annoying as your always listening to the awesome soundtrack this game delivers. With 6 different modes to play [and a secret one ;) ] you cant get bored of it. You might start to really hate this game sometimes as its very brutal with beginners, I guess i didn't warn you as the easiest level is actually :Hard Mode:Good Luck"

Or whatever.In order to survive, you will need the reflexes of a cat; the predictions of a cat; the many lives of a cat; the-- actually, just be a cat to win. Now that I have finished the introduction to this, the subliminal messages to worship all of cat kind have finally seeped into your puny human heads, and the reign of the Kitten Of Sauron can commence!All joking aside, this game is not everyone's cup of tea, and if you are the sort of person who gets frustrated and rage quits easily: LEAVE AND DO NOT EVER RETURN TO THIS GAME. If you are the sort who are determined to complete any game you start: prepare to have your will tested, your emotions subtly controlled, and your brain slowing turn to mulch as you become obsessed with hexagons and pentagons, as well as being constantly annoyed that Terry did not use base 10 for fractions of seconds. Think about your choice carefully, as I can only ramble for so long and there is time to kill. The fate of the Earth is in your hands, and only the true heroes will choose the correct choice, but only the people who choose wrong will understand which decision was right.I make no sense. Roll with it. It's been great getting hated on, spat at, and generally repressed by you internet ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s who think an ant has no right to make reviews that barely make sense.Also, prepare for some not-so-natural progression in terms of levels.

You probably look at the screenshots and trailers and think it's boring, but it's like tetris or bejeweled; once you start, you get addicted, only there's more, because each level is only a minute long, yet take a good while to complete on account of difficulty. Much more than say yawning your way through the early levels of tetris, or going from ""this is easy"" to ""aaaaaah!"".Visuals: 4/10The graphics to this game are simple, yet get the job done.  The lighting is somewhat psychodelic and trippy at first, but extended plays can result in headaches or migraines.Sound: 9/10Great classic synthetic music that makes me desperately want whatever synthesiser they used. The announcer lady doesn't get annoying, which is another plus, and the sound effects are functional. I'd give it a 10 if there was any ground breaking aspect to the sound, but there's not.Learning Curve: 9/10The easiest difficulty is hard. Yet the game doesn't require any explaining to play, beyond maybe a paragraph. It's quick to learn but not so to master. That is what a good learning curve is. The only reason it's not a 10 is because the easiest difficulty is 'hard', where maybe there should be a 'normal' as well.Replayability: 8/10This game isn't sandbox, so it won't keep bringing you back in a few years time to try something new. But the game is fun and score-based, so there's reason to play beyond completion. Plus the gameplay is just fun to just go on to simply play rather than to reach some sort of goal.Interface: 9/10The game is open to many kinds of inputs, and given its simplicity, these are never complicated. The controls are easy, but controlling the triangle can get frustrating at times when you overshoot or undershoot where you're trying to go. The UI is simple and easy to follow.Story: N/AThe game has no story. It is an arcade-style game.Support: N/AThe game has very very little room for bugs, works on simple OpenGL graphics, and is unlikely to get updates. Thus there's no real need for any support.Optimisation: N/AThe game's simple design means it can run on practically anything, so optimised graphics etc isn't an issue.Value for money: 10/10I just bought the game for under 40p. It's cheap even when not on sale, too.-----Overall:-----8.1 /10-----"

It’s like having a seizure while tripping balls on heavy psychedelic drugs.Length:3+Score:6/10Full Review:Super Hexagonis a pretty simple and straightforward game. Now admittedly, when I first saw screenshots for the game, and even the first time I watched a video on it, I really had no idea what the hell was going on. This was a combination of the trippy visuals, and just how simplistic it is graphically.You play as a triangle, which circles around a hexagon at the center of the screen. You simply use the arrow keys to move clockwise and counter-clockwise. As you circle around the center, lines will move from the outside of the screen towards the center hexagon. If the lines hit you, you “die.”The game has 6 levels, 3 you begin with, and 3 that are hard modes of the levels that you unlock for completing the corresponding basic level. To “complete” a level you must survive for 60 seconds. I put complete in quotes in that last sentence, because levels last until you die, there’s no set end point. However, the game rewards you with an achievement for lasting 60 seconds and considers it as beating the level.Levels are comprised of different patterns of lines that you must dodge, for each 10 seconds that you survive, you unlock an additional set of patterns (up to the first 60 seconds). On some levels the center hexagon even morphs into a pentagon or a square to shake things up a bit. Other than that, there’s not a whole lot else to the gameplay.The music in the game consists of 3 different electronic songs, and they fit the game pretty well, correctly matching the trippy visuals, with rapidly changing colours. I just wish there were than only 3 tracks in the game, as while the tracks are good, it’d be nice to have a few more.The gameplay itself is pretty damn difficult, much more than one would likely expect from such a simple game. As such, I’ve not been able to beat the game, and I’ve so far only managed to last the full minute on only the first two levels. I’m not sure that I’ll be able to complete any other levels, though I’ll likely play it a bit more here and there. Chances are though, that even if you can’t beat the game (quite likely), you’ll probably be able to get at least 3 hours of entertainment out of it before you move on to another game. Given that the game is only $3 normally, and sometimes goes on sale for $1, I think that’s a reasonable price to pay for what you get.Super Hexagonisn’t a must have game, but it’s still a fun little time killer now and then. Chances are you won’t beat it, but it’s more of an arcade game where you see how long you can last anyway. Give it a chance if that’s your sort of thing."

,Recommended,221640,17179659,"Posted: 22 July, 2015",all,SabreCat,"Years ago, I read an essay aboutGeometry Warsthat praised it as a ""video game"" of the purest possible sort: no narrative, no simulation, an experience not expressible in any other medium than the digital arcade. That essay stuck with me, and it comes to mind whenever I play a minimalist arcade game. Super Hexagon falls into that rarefied genre.Super Hexagonis a neuron trainer, an activity of mental self-construction on a basal level. You can't think your way to victory; there's no time for that. Instead you relax, empty your mind, and let your eyes, reflexes, and fingers play and learn. There are no patterns to memorize or level layouts to rehearse; each sub-minute ""game"" unfurls randomly enough to prevent rote training. There are no powerups to acquire or new abilities to unlock; the only thing leveling up is you, the player. You fail, and fail, and yet your best times slowly creep higher as the substrate of your brain manufactures aSuper Hexagonlayer. Then perhaps you take a break, and the pulsing soundtrack and whirling geometric shapes linger in your skull, reinforcing your neural net for the next session. It's as much meditative practice as game.Don't expect to beat this one without many hours of practice on what is, to all accounts, an otherwise useless skill set. But for a few dollars, you can partake of a pastime with no analogue, a memorable artifact with the soul ofCentipede,Tempest, and all the other pure video games of our era."

Super Hexagon is a difficult, yet amazingly simple game that will keep you coming back as you see your time on each level go up. Progression is the key to this game, and if you are able to keep up with it's fast pace gameplay, you'll find yourself deeply enticed by the games colorful graphics and catchy music.You begin as a triangle outside of a hexagon and soon walls will close into that hexagon. Your goal is to naviagate around these walls, looking for that open space as to not be crushed by them. The idea is very simple, yet the gameplay is dependent on your ability to quickly move around these walls. You WILL hear ""Game Over"" a lot and it WILL be frustrating. But like I said before, progression is the key to this game and soon you will find yourself getting better at manuevering.There are 6 levels in total, 3 of which are unlocked by beating the beginning stages. Each stage has different patterns, with how the walls will move in on you. The colors, speed and music is also dependent on which stage you play. Each stage increases in difficulty and the speed ramps up significantly. So it's advise to start at the first stage and move your way up."

Not that it is in any kind comparable when looking at the gameplay or puzzling aspects, but the only way to get through the levels is to really shut down your brain and let your reflexes take over.The first three or four rounds of playing I didn't get over ten seconds alive and couldn't grasp how to survive in this psychedelic world of flashing walls and rotation (oh, the rotation), but it pretty quickly becomes natural, partly due to my Tetris-drilled fingers, I guess and from that on it's plainly awesome.It's all about challenging yourself to be better and better and it really only depends on you, not at all on luck.

Keep in mind, if you don't like challenging games, or don't have much patience, this game is NOT for you. I first played this game at my friends house, on the first level I quickly grew addicted and tried to beat his high score. After that, my friend's brother beat mine, I tried returning as number 1, and while doing so I beat the first level. And now that I own it, oh god. It's SUPER addicting. I can literally talk to friends on skype while playing this, and HOURS fly by. If I play without any type of distraction, I start getting irritated, which leads to me doing worse, which makes me more irritated. ITS CHALLENGING! If you try to get hexagon in every consecutive level before moving on, you will be surprised with your progress. Hexagonest looked impossible when I first played this game, I just beat it, and then beat Hyper mode of Hexagon soon after. It is a challenging game, but once you get the hang of it, it can be really easy as long as you stay concentrated, calm, and not irritated. And playing this while you are tired is A BIG MISTAKE. So yeah, if you want a cheap game that will make you feel awesome as you beat challenging levels, buy it. It is very unique, the music is AWESOME. Although I will say you do get tired of listening to the same 10-30 second clips of songs if you aren't doing well and keep getting game over. 10/10, its a very unique game and the price makes it more than worth it."

Only difference is you constant epilepsy and mind ♥♥♥♥ing. It is a very difficult game and requires a lot of concentration in order to just get past the first level. The soundtrack is also what sets the atmosphere of hardcore intense gameplay, it is also the key to getting through the game.

Very challenging and fun with an amazing soundtrack. My only criticism is the difficulty curve is kinda wonky. You may want to skip around after finishing 1 and 2.This game can technically be beaten in about 6 minutes, but it took me 34 hours. I initially avoided this because of my temper, but it really didn't get to me too often because every failure always feels like your fault. There's always a way through, and it takes 1 second to restart. If you eventually do get frustrated, the game takes almost no time to close or boot up. I recomend playing with vsync off, and not in fullscreen so you don't use your peripheral vision as much. Also this game will take a while to train your brain and hand eye coordination, so don't expect to beat it on the first day."
