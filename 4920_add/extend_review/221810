The game needs to be played a minimum of five times through to see every ending for every character, and long, slow ladder-climbing animations sometimes slow sections down to a tedious crawl. There’s a noticeable systematic use of padding to artificially increase playtime, a very obnoxious practice.The stories for the individual characters are serviceable but kind of shallow so it’s not really a strong story-telling game. In particular the ""good"" endings for the characters make little sense and feel like an afterthought, as if they were too skittish to make a game full of nothing but lurid black comedy.The reason I still recommend it is that the atmosphere and humor are quite good, so I enjoyed the game despite how sloppy it is in a few places. I wouldn’t advise paying full price for it, though."

,Not Recommended,221810,13038910,"Posted: 22 November, 2014",all,Simon the Zealot,"The Cave was a big disappointment for me. I used to consider myself a Double Fine fan, considering practically every DF title to be an instant purchase. However, I consider their more recent releases to be of much lower quality than I would expect from a developer I admired so. The Cave was the first of these.First off, as a puzzle platformer, most of the puzzles in the game aren't particularly challenging or interesting, often consisting of a simple ""find key, open door."" Some puzzle mechanics are fun, such as the Time Traveller's ability to alter events in the past to change a level's layout in the future. Mechanics such as these aren't very common, as many of the puzzles are generic so that any character can complete them, likely to avoid conflicts in your party composition.Every character has their own backstory which covers how or why they arrived at the titular Cave, but after going through the first couple of characters' levels, you'll notice the common theme pretty quickly and the story exploration becomes uninteresting. It almost feels like an attempt to make ""another Psychonauts"" by the nature of its writing, with The Cave's backstory exploration echoing similarly to the repressed memories in Psychonauts. However, many may find The Cave's characterization extremely lacking in comparison. Its humor is there but it lacks the quality writing underneath which made other DF titles work so well.The Cave tops off its first (very short, no more than 4-5 hour) playthrough with a picture montage (yet again reminiscent of the repressed memories in Psychonauts) and a text notification informing you that you have beaten The Cave, rather than any sort of proper ending. The Cave encourages the player to go through the game at least three times to unveil every character's backstory, with the game not ""actually"" being beaten until then. Due to the repetition of solving many of the same puzzles across each playthrough, I was not interested in finishing the game a second time. The writing wasn't even interesting enough to convince me to power through the repetition of doing them again.All in all, despite its many weak points, The Cave has a few interesting puzzle mechanics that make it worth playing, especially if it can be grabbed for 75% off or more. Unless it's a title you are very interested in, however, I'd avoid it altogether."
,Recommended,221810,11086223,"Posted: 5 July, 2014",all,BobbyOahu,"The Cave is set up like an old-school 2D side-scroller.  Seven adventurers, each with a dark past, go down into a magical cave in a journey of self discovery.  At the beginning of the game (which is narrated throughout by The Cave itself), you choose three of the seven advernturers and descend.  Each section of The Cave is a puzzle that requires your three characters to work together.  Three of the sections are uniquely designed (by the sentient Cave) for the characters you've chosen.  In this way, The Cave encourages you to play though multiple times.The drawback is that there's also three generic puzzle sections which you cannot skip.  I'm on my second playthrough, and while it's nice that the game shuffles the order of the puzzles, it can be a drag to re-solve old puzzles to get to new content.  And the achievements require you to play through the game... I don't know how many times, but I imagine The Cave's jokes (while clever) will start to wear thin on the fifth playthrough.  If you really want to get 100% achievements, you might consider reviewing the achievement list online before you play, despite the mild spoilers.I'd still recommend this game - the humor, art and story make this puzzle game very enjoyable and encourage multiple playthroughs.  May get monotonous if you're looking for all the achievements.A definite buy if it's on sale."

It has poor level design with a lot of back tracking and little gameplay development. I had several issues and bugs while playing The cave, like items disapearing or character dropping out of the map all of a sudden while climbing a ladder. The last issue was particularly frustrating because it prevented me from finishing the game in my first run since I wasn't able to use one of my characters. Also, if you are looking for coop game, you should know that the coop often lets one player doing nothing and that the whole game can be acheived by only one person and doesn't change accordingly to the number of players.Apart from that, the music is good, the graphics as well. Naration is funny and the stories are deep.I will not recomend this game since I had a lot of issues with it and I was searching for a good coop couch game which in my opinion is not what The Cave is."

Unless you enjoy watching your friend do complicated, drawn-out puzzles for 20 minutes then do not play this game with others. There is no split-screen or way to view your character while your friend plays theirs, you can only view one at a time. During certain parts of the game it forces you to play a single character for an entire level, leaving any friends you might be playing with to sit and be forced to watch you try and figure it out for the entire duration.The levels are also unnecessarily big for what they need to be, leaving you to run around up and down ladders and ropes just to extend the play time. This game might be enjoyable by yourself if you like running/climbing simulators, but I didn't find anything enjoyable about it at all. I'm glad I bought it on sale and it's definitely not worth the standard price."
,Not Recommended,221810,7747148,"Posted: 25 November, 2013",all,Ronnie,"The Cave is a Double Fine adventure game looking like it's trying to be one of the old Lucas Arts titles back in the 90's with promise of witty writing and a unique gaming experience with each play through.The game allows you to pick three of the seven characters available and use your team to explore the deepest part of the cave each with their own story but the characters you pick have no personality, do not speak,  do not interact with the other players and are only used as ways to access a specific dungeon that tells a small story to said characters.The Cave works on a linear level like progression where each part has one main puzzle and each puzzle plays out the same, collect certain items that each character can hold only one of . Use Item A on mechanism B to open the next area. This would not be so bad if you did not have to control three separate characters at one time to pick up only one item and having to traverse a platform -esque dungeon to get to the other side, trying to micromanage where each player must be using some poor platforming and slow movements.One of the biggest turn offs to the game is once your first run through is completed you get to go through the game again with another three players but the dungeons and puzzles all stay the same apart from the characters cave segment but with seven characters this means you will have to play the game three times with the last run through having players you have already played before! These short slideshow endings are most definitely not worth it.The dialogue is mildly entertaining, limited and delivered mostly by the narration which  does repeat itself on each replay.The game has a lot of charm and character but these alone will not hold up next to poorly implemented game design, mechanics and for a title that is trying to encourage replayabillity it comes off incredibly shallow."

,Not Recommended,221810,20327372,"Posted: 5 January, 2016",all,General Kass,"A puzzle platformer in which you chose 3/7 characters and go on an adventure in a talking cave, finding out that each character is not so secretly evil (or maybe not).For a puzzle platformer, the puzzles are insanely easy. This comes from the ability to only pick up one item per character at a time. So there is no puzzle that requires multiple inventory actions on a single puzzle.The puzzles are also fairly obvious, either way:*You need to cheat a ""guess your weight"" game. You have a barbell and a magician that can turn items invisible to help you.*You need to use an elevator, but the fuse is missing, luckily there's a fusebox with a fuse on the other side of the map that doesn't do anything.Not to mention that the puzzles are padded to increase the length of the game. There's a part where you need your companions to stand on different colored pressure plates while the third navigates a maze. Rather than just doing it once or twice to demonstrate that you understand the mechanics, you have to do it half a dozen times. The worse is a mansion themed level which is 4 stories tall and you constantly have to run up and down the halls to complethete it.Additionally, the puzzles have similar solutions. This one is especially heinous. There are a total of 13 levels in the game and 7 of them are character specific while the others are generalized. Of those 6 general levels 2 of them have no puzzles. On top of that, the last 2 generalized levels have the exact same solution which involves tricking an NPC with a tape recorder. This is inexcusable and really shows they were running out of ideas.Speaking of levels, when you enter character specific levels, your other two members become dead weight except for occassionally weighing down other objects. In the mansion themed level, your other two party members can't even be used. To make matters worse, there's a mine themed level where you need to navigate 3 levles of labyrinth like mazes, which is fairly time consuming. The catch is that every time you complete the puzzle on one of these levels, you need to individually walk each of the 3 members up to the next level and insert them in the puzzle. Its frustrating, time consuming, and only serves to pad the game.Luckily, the environment and style are pretty good and 2 of the NPCs are even charming.Finally, the game has no replay value, despite requiring a minimum of 5 replays to get all 14 endings. The puzzles are even easier once you know the solution, there's no reason to speed run, so you play the entire game again just to find out the ""good"" or ""bad"" ending for a character, which becomes pretty obvious before you even get it.*No replay value, but many replays.  To make matters worse, with a group of 3 comprised from 7 characters, you're 3rd play, you'll only be expericing 1 new level.For all of these reasons, I cannot recommend The Cave, even though there were parts that I liked."

In an attempt to make it replayable, you can pick three characters, each of whom have a good and bad ending. And the number of characters doesn't divide by three. There's seven, so you have to play the game three times to see all the basic content, but there's extensive sections that remain the same each time. If you want every ending, that's five playthroughs! (you can get the alternate endings for the first two characters as you're taking number 7 through for the first time.)If only it weren't for that, it would be an incredible puzzling charming and genuinely funny game. Even with that it kept me playing five times. And yet, my abiding memory is one of boredom. It's unfortunate that's the lasting experience of what should have been a great game."

And the cave is beautiful, and fun to explore. Some of the puzzles are super easy, others not so much. But even though the pacing is slow, the game itself looks like it will be short. The replay value is good though ---- just choose different characters for each playthrough. And with all the slow walking and backtracking, that kind of pads out the game length. I guess I just expected more, because I kept waiting for the pace to pick up, but it didn't.So I'm glad I got it on sale, and that's how I'll recommend the game with some reservation ---- 75% off only, I would think."

I was equally frustrated by the game for as much as it charmed me.The Cave is a hybrid point-and-click adventure paired with the mechanics of a platformer. You're given a choice of seven characters to choose from (An Adventurer, Knight, Scientist, Time-Traveler, Hillbilly, pair of Twins, and Monk), each of which can change the journey of your playthrough.The art design of the game is lovely and the voice work is doubly so. It has that Monkey Island charm that Ron Gilbert is so well-known for and it shows through the many humorous spouts of dialogue from the narrator and various people you meet in the cave. There are lots of little touches that will please even the most picky of gamers and it's in my opinion that the charm of this game is easily one of its strongest components.The objective of the game is to discover the backstories of each character through a series of illustrations unlocked by finding symbols on the walls of the cave. At the start of each game you select 3 characters to journey through the cave with, each with a unique level attributed to them. Some are fun, such as the Knight's level in-which you steal an amulet from a dragon and end up destroying the kingdom in the process, but some are just tedious, such as the Adventurer's level, filled with puzzles that give you no indication of how to solve them. Along the way you play through each character's origin story which involves puzzle solving, block pushing, item-using, and so on. It's just such a shame that the endings of each character (of which there are two for each), only involve still pictures and no sort of interactive elements. If you want to get the opposite ending, you have to play through the entire game again with no real changes to the levels. The gameplay of The Cave can best be described as ""tedious"", and for a game that depends on multiple playthroughs this is a big problem.Sorry Ron, but this adventure just wasn't up to par."

You choose 3 out of 7 characters, who all come with their unique abilities, background story and areas. You move around by climbing ladders and ropes. There are common areas where you need all three characters to solve the puzzles and specific character areas that need the respective character's ability to be solved.The puzzles are stupidly hard, I played this game with my partner, and we couldn't of finished it without the aid of the walkthrough. You would need some very critical thinking in order to get past the second level without some sort of guide.As this was my partners first proper PC game she had played, apart from Sims and WoW, I think it did a very good job of introducing different game mechanics for people who haven't even played this sort of game before.This title is not very linear, which will catch many modern gamers by surprise, who are used to heavy handed scripted playing. The humor is dark and entertaining, so are the individual stories behind the characters. The art and mood is amazing in here too.The annoying part of the game is that you often at times have to walk back and forth to solve puzzles, which is compounded by the fact that you sometimes need to move three characters to a specific location. A character summon function would have been handy here. But that doesn't ruin an excellent gaming experience for a low price.I hope the younger gamers will appreciate it despite the lack of heavy scripting from newer games. We both thoroughly enjoyed the game, but like I said, without the aid of a walkthrough, I fear there may of been an argument at times at deciding which way to do the puzzle!Check out more reviews onhttp://completingthebacklog.blogspot.co.uk/"

Unfortunately, the game is pretty clunky. There is a lot of backtracking and the characters don't move very quickly. There is no way to teleport unused characters to your location, which means there is a lot of walking over the same spot 3 times.  Navigating the ladders and platforms isn't a lot of fun either. The ladders are slow and the platform edges don't always work out how you want them to.I purchased this game looking for a nice couch co-op game. This is not that at all. Some of the puzzles are only do-able by 1 person at a time, and the other player just gets to watch. Also if you get too far apart only the player in focus can play. I do, however like that there is a button to give the focus to the other player.

However, afterwards is where it falls flat.The game provides you with 7 heroes, each with a different story. Your first playthrough, you can complete 3. Your second you can do another 3, and then you have 1 left over.Now, a second playthrough has you play 3 more heroes in several identical zones, with no change of Act 1 or 3, just Act 2, meaning the majority of the game is the same as the first run. The last run is even worse, as you need to perform only 1 scenario different with 1 new hero.This math problem, and poor level/game design, leads you to completing it once with absolutely no desire to do it again, which is a huge shame!The game is fun and bright and whimsical, and I'd love to complete it again, but I refuse to force myself through recycled content for the sake of completion.

You just hold one thing per character, and once you move onto the next area you can pretty much just drop anything you're holding and not worry about having to go back to a previous zone (because you can't). It's just light-hearted and humorous adventure gaming with some platforming thrown in to keep you engaged.

You pick three characters for each play through, each character has its unique level and there are some common levels. The puzzles and fun and satisfying, humour is great and the style is nice. There are a few little complaints you could make. Since each play through has the same common levels you end up doing those repeatedly but I didn't mind as they are fun. It is a little odd playing it with two people as you have to control three characters and end up stealing control from each other accidentally but that is not too bad once you get used to it. The only thing that did bother me is that each character has two endings and the way to get the good ending is completely not obvious, I would not have even known there was a good ending if I hadn't seen the Zero Punctuation review beforehand.

There are no tasking platforming elements, which is great since there is quite a bit of backtracking involved. The puzzles are simple and amount to little more than scouring the area for items whose purpose is usually easy to sort out, or arranging your characters so that they 'work together' to solve a puzzle. This generally means that most of the game's content is in travelling and taking in the sights rather than elaborate puzzles and dialogue trees, which is good only if you're expecting this.There are two main highlights for me: the narration by the Cave itself, and the surprisingly dark storylines of each of the 7 characters. The characters themselves have subtle personality, even though they don't have any dialogue. Each character's area is well designed and wonderful to experience, and made me want to play through each person's story.I'd recommend this game for people who enjoy a slower paced game, who like to soak in atmosphere and interesting stories, and who aren't looking for a particularly difficult challenge."

,Recommended,221810,7855799,"Posted: 30 November, 2013",all,b-rom,"I have an opinion on the The Cave, but I'm having a hard time deciding exactly what it is.  It isn't a bad game, but it's quite a long ways from perfect.  If I were a teacher and The Cave was an assignment somebody had handed in, I would give it a passing grade, but it certainly wouldn't get a very high mark.Having said that, I seem to have put a fair amount of time into it, and I do plan on finishing off the rest of the acheivements.  So there is something to be said about it.At its heart The Cave is a puzzle based adventure game.  The controls are simple enough, and it's rare that you need to do anything particularly precise with them.  You control three characters, each with their own story and one special ability that generally acts as a key to their area that other characters can't access.  So every time you play you pass by the spots where a given character's story is to be told, and if that character is in your group you can go in, if not you carry on past.Each area is a collection of puzzles.  Some you can solve with one of the characters, some require you to position multiple characters and perform actions nearly simultaneously from across the map.  You never need to aim at anything, and there isn't any combat as such.  There is one logic / math sort of puzzle, but they have a way of getting the solution if you can't figure it out.  In all honesty, I found that puzzle a lot more clear than many of the puzzles in this game.  There is a lot of your typical adventure-game-logic where you need to think outside the box to come to the solution.  The ""box"" in the last sentence would refer to normal human experiences and behaviour.  So, to use a hypothetical example, you might be required to use a slice of bread to open a door to keep your finger-prints off of it.  Something you probably wouldn't think of otherwise.So what does The Cave have going for it?  Well, the puzzles are generally fun, the narration is pretty much top notch, and it was nice to see the adventure game format return.  The story was pretty good, and while I have criticisms of it, they tend to be nit-picky sort of things.  A slight inconsistency of tone here, a lack of sympathetic character there.The fun part of this though is what The Cave does wrong.  The number one thing, and this is a glaring issue from my perspective, is the repetition.  This game repeats its repititions.  It has loops inside loops.  I can't believe anybody would develop a game with this much repitition in it.  Have I said repitition too many times yet?  If you think so, you're going to get very annoyed at The Cave very quickly.Right off the bat there are seven characters, seven stories, and you can only have three characters in your group at a time.  If you can follow along with my advanced calculus, that means that in order to see every character's story, you will need to play the game to completion a minimum of three times and repeat two characters.  In addition, each play through has you puzzle your way through six areas.  Three that are character story dependent, and three that are there every time.  The puzzles never change anywhere, so if you play through the game the minimum number of times to see each character's story, you will still have those three sections mastered.But that's not all.  Each character has two possible endings.  So if you want to see the entire story for any given character, you need to play through twice, and the only difference is one decision right at the end.Moving away from the repitition, this is one of the buggiest games I have played in a long time.  It's not that uncommon, especially for a PC gamer, to see a game that crashes from time to time, or that has one specific graphics glitch.  The Cave is constantly tripping up, failing in some weird way or just acting funny.  It's like they didn't play test it all that much.  For instance, there are many places where you need to stand beside an object, like a crate or something, and push it around.  Well, frequently when you try and do so the character will start jittering around instead of pushing.  On one occasion I jumped a character onto the bottom step of a porch only to have her ghost through the step so she was standing inside it.  It took some doing to find the right set of moves to get her unstuck.  I've had the game just decide to stop listening to the keyboard (except for the escape key interestingly).  After my first time playing I quit the game and when I started it back up again, it had lost my saves and any connection to steam.  No acheivements rang in, I couldn't access the steam overlay, nothing.  But every other game worked fine with steam.  The next time I started the game, steam was back again, and any progress I had made in the intervening session was lost.All in all I do recommend this game, but I do so with a lot of hesitation.  There's fun to be had here, and I do enjoy playing it, but at the same time it really isn't very polished.  If you have no other games that you want to play, and some money burning a hole in your pocket, then this might be a decent way to spend some time.  However, if you have other titles that you are interested in, pick them up first."

This means that you can have 2 completely unique playthroughs, but then if you want to see the 7th character's storyline you'll have to do a third playthrough with mostly repeated content.Second, I feel like this game would have benefitted from more voice acting, although I understand this might have been due to budget restrictions, but if it was a stylistic choice then I just don't get it.The characters you play as are supposed to have these big dark backstories that you uncover, but there's never any opportunities to show their personalities, even when I was playing as particular characters I felt like the story that was being revealed was for NPCs not the characters I was controlling. I think this could have been showed off more through voice acting.However, the game is still very charming. You're led through the game by The Cave itself, an omniscient narrator who has a dry sense of humor as he details all of your experiences. It's actually pretty fun. In addition, there's quite a lot to like about many of the levels, especially the ones that are specific to certain characters. The hillbilly's carnival level in particular was  a lot of fun.The games not very challenging. If you're paying attention most puzzles are pretty easy. However, there are certain parts that seem to drag on.It's definitely not perfect, but overall I think it's a decent game, although the writing isn't quite up to what I expect from Double Fine."

Most puzzles felt fair.The art (3d rendered, cutaway side scroller) I felt was particularly pretty. I laughed at the jokes and enjoyed the overall story.My one complaint was the repetition. There are seven characters and you play a game with three of the characters at one time. There are three common levels you have to play through in each play of the game and in addition to this, each character has a unique level. Thus if you want to see all levels (they are worth it) you have a decent amount of repetition ahead of you. While repetition in some games may be fun, I think it is less fun in a puzzle game. I'm surprised the developers didn't give the player a mechanism to skip these levels if you had already completed them. There is already a mechanism to skip the levels of characters that you're not playing with.That's a minor criticism. It only matters if you enjoyed your first playthrough so much that you're ready to go back for more."

Every character has their own masterfully crafted level.  The only level I would complain even a little about is one of the ""in-between"" levels about the miner.  Other than that, every level is packed with personality and very clever puzzles. (My personal favorite level was the Hillbilly's, but they are all fantastic)  The writing in this game is some of the best dark humor I have come across.  The narration done by the cave itself is extremely well written and the voice acting is just as great.  I have read some reveiws where the game was lambasted for ""excessive back-tracking"".  I really have to disagree with that as (with the exception of the miner level) back tracking is usually not more that 10-15 seconds as you travel between puzzle hotspots.  The complaints I read about this seemed really exageratted to me and shouldn't be a turn off to anyone wanting to play this game.

For example the characters jump several seconds AFTER you hit the jump button, and they will often run on after you release the arrow key (so if you want/need them to stand in an exact location, forget the keyboard and just use the mouse).This can make certain puzzles a struggle too, since even after you've worked out what to do, actually completing the puzzle is made even more difficult due to the above control issue, and on several areas where you have to do a lot of difficult jumping and climbing make one mistake and you have to do the entire puzzle all over again, the under reactive controls can be adjusted to, but still make some areas a lot harder than they should be.That said this game has plenty of charm, character, a good re playability value, and the narration can be genuinely funny.

It's true you have to do multiple playthroughs to see everything, and have to repeat parts in doing so, but the repetition is actually pretty quick once you know what to do so it's not a big deal. It's well worth a tenner."

They do drag after serveral replays considering no matter what set of characters you choose you need to play the same 4 levels but the puzzles are challenging and real thinkers if you are in to platformers and headscratchers this is a game for you. Puzzle solutions are very creative such as using a parrot to record a dog barking, making yourself stink like a dinosaur to attract a live dinosaur to crush with an ancient wheel to make oil to run an ancient engine and other crazy puzzles. Ther are 2 endings for each character fun visuals, sorta silly jokes and a quirky narration by The Cave itself. Pretty much The Cave is the American cousin of the the Narrator from The Stanely Parable who is not as funny but would get a one shot Comedy Central 30 min special that is mildly amusing and watchable 2 more times before  becoming less humorous each and everytime afterwards and you end up flipping the channel to some reruns of Bob Ross to get his voice out of your head.TL;DRFun, challenging puzzles, cool cartoony visuals, amusing narration, lots of replay to see entire game, kinda boring and repitive after several replays but still fun. 8/10 would play again.

The number of character available isn't a multiple of three(That means that you will have to go through the path of two characters two times). That completely breaks apart the idea of a replayable game, because you basically have to go through the same content several time to get the new content(Which isannoying and pointlessin a point & click game, it's a repetitive mindboggling grind).If you have the time and patience(I am usually really patient, and I have a lot of time for games, though I hadn't enough)You will probably enjoy all the content of the game, and be really happy with it.

The problem with not having all that much money but having way too much time on my hands as a child. That's first world problems for you.I'm not going to say it's for everyone, though. The humor is rather dry and often at least a little bit macabre (the twins, for instance) but if you like dark humor (which I love) this game will at least be fun for that.There are a few problems. There are some odd glitches every now and again, though they are not all that frequent (unless you're doing the no deaths runthrough, when every deadly glitch rears its ugly head). The biggest problem is that you can't skip any of the cutscenes or dialogue. Don't get me wrong, both are superb in this game (I'm pretty sure Grey DeLisle voices at least one of them, too) but since this is a game that relies on multiple playthroughs, the skip feature really should have been included.

You have to walk great distances to pick up an item because there's no inventory system and it's non-obvious which item you should have in hand, which just seems to extend the levels unnecessarily for what are otherwise pretty straight forward puzzles. If you're new to puzzle adventure games this could be a nice gentle introduction, but it's certainly not got the depth that you would want if you've been playing these games for years."

This part was just a pure waste of time and makes this game not enjoyable to me.-- The ""riddles"" are way to easy, and if this game is more about the story than those riddles, then why did the game design make us get and return objects and/or climb ladders for ages?+ Nice graphicsTaking away the time spent on ladder/rope climbing and tedious run-and-get tasks, the play time for a playthrough would end up being 15% of the time. This game is stretched like the backdoor of a pornstar specialised on backdoor porn.  For this reason alone I would give this game a big fat thumbs down.

He also abandoned, what can make both boring. Too much dying in a plattformer and musing without any action about puzzles in adventure-games. He just kept the minimalistic elements and did so create a realy addicting pastime event. I couldn't stop until I was finished and had never the urge to take a look in a walkthrough, I did so often when time took to long to solve a puzzle without nothing other happens meanwhile.

They are: The Knight; The Cientist; The Adventurer; The Twins; The Monk; The Time Traveler; and The Hillbilly. You'll be taken on a journey to find what they desire most and what they would do to get it. The cave is divided into seven character themed stages and three unchangable stages that are interconnected. So whenever you play you'll go through three stages based on each of the characters you choose at the start and three that will aways be the same. The Cave is filled with puzzles, interesting stories and a funny narrator. The only problem I have with the game is the fact that to play with three new characters I had to go through the other three unchangable levels and there was still one character left to play with, but this one I watched on Youtube. Overall the puzzles are really good, but some are better than others. I would recommend you to play with the Cientist, the Time Traveler and the Hillbilly, because they have the best stages. Then play with the Adventurer, the Twins and the Monk, which are ok. The Knight has the worst stage, but it is on the start of the cave so you can easily play it as the last character and then watch his endings on Youtube."

Needless to say, The Cave failed to deliver any of the features that made these games fun.The puzzles are nearly all straightforward and lead to few of the ""ah-ha!"" moments that should have been prominent in such a game. Most of the time required to solve the puzzles involves walking back and forth across each level, and few of the puzzles relate in a meaningful way to any story. The idea of including unique levels for each character chosen is a nice idea, but these character stories aren't particularly motivating or fulfilling.The narrator admittedly has its own charm that can be fun at times. However, the simple premise of ""three adventurers wander around in a cave"" leaves little for the development of sophisticated humor that intertwines with a farcical yet compelling plot. I miss games like that, and unfortunately The Cave doesn't quite fit the bill."

That's how it's supposed to work, right? A creator who pioneers an era of video-gaming gets shoved aside for a few years, and he comes back, proving he just needed monetary backing to let his creative energies flow and creates a solid game that showcases his unique vision and proves himself worthy of great respect and consideration.I wanted to experience that... but I did not.The puzzles are fun the first playthrough, and the concept of ""different characters can solve the puzzles different ways,"" filled me with nostalgic glee for the original Maniac Mansion, but it's not to be. The majority of puzzles are the same no matter who you choose. The characters' individual powers only really matter for their individual maps and some token moments. Moreover, most of the characters just aren't that interesting. The Scientist's story was probably the best. The Twins' was at least amusing. But, the rest...The game has multiple endings. The ending you get depends entirely on a choice you make at the very end of the game. You must play through the game a second time to see the other ending. No saving and reloading. This is not how you do multiple endings in a satisfying way. This is just wasting our time.You probably would be better off watching a Let's Play than actually playing the game."

You can take control of a group of three quite unique and well desighned characters from a pool of seven as you lead them to face their dark secrets and gain the one thing they truely desire.The problem with this game come in three factors. One, while the characters look interesting at first glance. you quickly realize that the only view into what make them up is literaly a seven page comic that you find pieces of alonge the way. None of them will say anything about the things and events around them which is a heavy staple in any adventure game. Having differnt people observe the same places that you have to go through every playthough in seperat ways would drastically cut down on the monotonus parts of this game which leads to...Factor number two which is that several of the puzzles while clever are hanpered by long hallway and slow ladders seperating each puzzle piece. This is also compounded by the fact that each member of your group can only carry one item at a time neccesitating constant back and forth even well you do find out what to do. One play through was hard enough which leads to.....Factor number three which is that if you want to get all of the ending comic panels you HAVE to play the game from start to end SIX TIMES. you have seven people to play as each with a good and bad ending which is decided by one final choice and a hidden one at that. Also you would think that playing as new people would change the game drastically but eachs person's dark deed moment is sectioned off into a different stage. I could see which ones I was missing as I passed the themed enterance down the cave.It pains me to pick this game to pieces because I really wanted this to be good. It had a good consept from under used genre. I was even reminded of a lighthearted silent hill as wierd as that sounds because both are about people with dark pasts venturing into a location that changes itself to force that dark secret into the person's face, But it's held back by bad use of the three person mechanic, shallow characters, and tedious puzzles."

The puzzles seem to be all over the board with not a lot of hints on what you should be doing, tho overall its a find key open door concept for most things.The game has different areas, some seem based on the characters and others are inaccessible, perhaps trying to promote replayability by picking the other available heroes a second time. No real tool tips on why you should pick certain characters to start off.The game overall has a nice design and I will probably finish it eventually, but at times it seems forced to be multiple games in one, too all over the board, hard to get imersed in to the world or the game play with 3 characters if you compare it to something like Trine.Edit:Just got the the end, and there is no ending, you are basically encouraged to start over with other characters, which in turn will make you replay about half of the same game play to once again, get to no ending.

While co-operative gameplay may be different, playing alone will require you to make the same journey to the next puzzle for each of the three characters you control, meaning a minimum of 3-times for one-way, 6-times if you need to double-back (and you likely will), and any number more if you get stuck. This game offers little more than repetition and traversing the more-or-less linier path, which is rendered a chore by the clunky and innacurate controls. If you're looking for a fun, beautiful, side-scrolling action-puzzler, you're far better off with Trine (which also offers 3-player co-op).If you're a die-hard fan of Double-Fine, as I am, give it a go. There are nods to your favourite games and glimmers of that humor we all love (not to mention the beautiful drawn-art and character design), yet within an hour I was bored and frustrated, and by two I'm writing this, not expecting the experiance to improve. Do yourself a favour and get a copy of Brutal Legend: a visually stunning and rich world full of action, humor and emotion that this game seems devoid of."

After my first playthrough I got to admit it was pretty fun, but the next two runs got boring and repetitive since your force to play through the same puzzle areas just to get the new part of the cave thats base on a different character you choose. The worse part in playing this is on the 3rd run you not only force to do the same puzzle areas but the same two character special areas with nothing new to challange you whatsoever just to get to the last area you have not explore.  Each characters in the game have a special trait in which to solve different puzzles. unfortunately they can only use them productively in their own special world thus making them unreliable when it comes to the  regular repetitive puzzle areas we all love so much. honestly the creaters could have made a better game if they allow us  to choose any of the seven characters on the fly and explore the whole cave in one run with added puzzles that requires more than one of their special abilities. I did enjoy the visuals, story, and voice acting since it reminds me of nightmare before christmas, Overall I say it's better to pass since it's a reptitive grind just to experiance the whole game. It would have been fine if they made it a one time playthrough with extra levels that extands the use of their abilities.

Now I'm not usually a fan of puzzle games unless done right but I must say I enjoyed The Cave. The game is charming, funny and cleverThe animations of the each individual characters, music and voice acting is awesome and well produced. The premise of the game is that there are seven characters and you pick three of them at the begining of the game and try to get them out of the caveEach character has a different story, a unique skill and their own levels. In order to get everyone out of the cave you need to play it at least three times. If you want to see everything the game has to offer (there are two endings for each character) you need at least five playthroughsThis may sound boring, but puzzle solving in this game is really fun. Also depending on your characters and the items you picked along the way, you can find some shortcuts in some certain levelsLong story short, even if you're not a fan of the genre, I say give The Cave a chance, it is a wonderful little indie game!RECOMMENDED :)"

In this case it proves you can have both classic gaming wrapped in charming graphics.  Very interesting twist having 7 characters to choose from, each with their own unique skills or special abilities.This goes along with a lot of the more recent adventure style games requiring multiple characters. One needs to be sent to hold a certain lever, another to pull on something else while the 3rd is there to accomplish the task. Each of 7 characters has a special gift or ability. The adventurer had her lasso in order to swing from over head features while the ""Twins"" can leave phantoms of themselves in place. Overall a great title, certainly does not disappoint. Puzzles are hard to enough to keep me interested. Very little if NO hand holding with this one. One thing the screenshots dont do justice to just how charming and nice the graphics are.

To describe it in one sentence would be ""One big glorious shared masturbation between Tim Schafer and the other Double Fine guys and every single one of their fans"".The way I see it, this is like Psychonauts but with the focus entirely on dialog and character development. It's also what Psychonauts would have been like if it were not for EA and LucasArts being moral watchdog pieces of♥♥♥♥♥♥ It explores pretty dark motivations and is not afraid of showing fairly brutal murder that the cartoony aesthetic makes more grim for some reason. Especially because of how The Cave reacts to it so non-chalantly. He's seen this cycle repeat for thousands of years.This is where the spoilers start. From what I can tell The Cave is a purgatory of sorts. Characters are stuck in a loop of reincarnation and retreading their paths until they can not be total ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s and be redeemed. It really makes the playthroughs seamless from both a story and technical standpoint.Speaking of technical standpoint, from the perspective of a programmer I am absolutely in love with this game for a few reasons. Firstly, it uses Buddha (appropriate name hm?) which as far as I can tell is an engine that Double Fine wrote for their stuff in house and uses Lua as an extension language. They used it for Costume Quest and probably Stacking and others. I deeply admire and respect when people write engines that are reusable and aren't just marketing throw-aways. Damn shame that Double Fine is keeping it proprietary though.Besides that, the story justifies the reuse of game assets marvelously. It uses mostly the same map but with minor changes for each character that opens pathways and other branches. It gets a little bit repetitive when you're doing the generic transition levels but still. I rarely see such a robust way of extending a game in a non-intrusive manner."

I doubt that you'd be surprised to hear that this game was developed by Double Fine, as the Psychonauts-esque zaniness and humour remains present in this title.The game is not without its peeves though. Take for example the fact that there are 7 characters with unique stories, yet you cannot adventure with more than 3 of them at the same time. This means playing through the game 3 times, once with 2 characters you've already played with, left as irritating third wheels. What's more, each character has a good ending and a bad ending, which means playing through the game more than once with each character anyway in order to obtain all the endings (Which I wouldn't personally recommend doing, seeing as the endings change very little) There are even several default levels in-between the character driven story levels, which you have to play every time, and playing through these levels becomes tedious very quickly, as you are often forced to backtrack in these stages.Despite all this, I'd recommend this title. Maybe not full price, but on sale, it's a no-brainer purchase."

The game play reminded me a lot of the old Vikings games, minus the perma-deaths, where you had to rely on the abilities of more than one person to get a job done.  The character levels and the “transition” levels (those stages usually between the character specific ones) were pretty fun and the puzzles, while not that hard, did give my brain a little exercise.     I won’t even bother gush over the art style or script for this game because you’d have to be made of stone not to like them.This all being said, I did have a few problems with it.  First off, seven was not the lucky number here, it should have been nine.  The reason for this is that, by the time you get to the third round of the game, you have now exhausted playing all but a single character.  This means you have to repeat at least two people’s levels.  Knowing exactly what to do makes for a less fun experience the second or third time around.  I say “third time around” because of my second complaint.  I would have loved to see this game provide more than three “transition” stages.  Again, the ideal number would have been nine.  If the game designers had given each character their own transitional stage, then you would have never felt like you were playing the same game twice.  Tedium is the worst enemy of the “one solution only” adventure game.  If you have already solved the puzzle once, what value is there in solving it exactly the same way again?Of course, even after saying that, I would still recommend this game to anyone who wants an excuse to laugh and enjoy a few hours running around a sentient cave.  Just remember, sometimes your greatest desires can be your own worst enemy."

At that point, I put it a side for a year or two. But now, when I returned to it, there is basically nothing to complaing about. I still experienced a minor glitch, where gamepad stopped working in the final scene of the game where our heroues receive their trophies, that is the start/menu button on game pad still work, and the stick works while in the menu, but when you exit the menu I could not control the characters with the stick, they simply would not react. This was minor for me though, because it was in the very end and I finished the game with the keyboard.Overall the game appears very well thought through. You cannot paint yourself in the corner no matter what silly things you do, the game reduces tedium by automatically bringing the two other character with you when the first one reaches an invisible ""checkpoint"" so you do not need to cover big distances with all three, and the difficulty level of the game was just right for me (some people may find it too easy). I finished the game with all seven characters and there were only two places where I had to google the answer (timetraveller well and monks lotus). On the other hand the game is not ovious, that is you still have to think how to reach the objective.Graphics looks very good even today in 2016, and I also appreciate that games feels like it gives more ""freedom"" than your usual adventure. By that I do not mean freedom of choice of course, in this respect the game adheres to the genre standards, I mean freedom of movement. In that respect it feels more like a platfoformer than an adventure which is good. But unlike a platformer, it's much easier to succeed in jumps and climbings up a ledge, which is also good.So providing that you do not lose your save file as I did, I think this game is a very good choice, so I'd recommend it strongly if you like adventures. This one is very, very good."

The core function of The Cave is puzzle solving, and that's where this games' faults begin. First off, the puzzles are absolutely annoying unless you instantly understand each characters' special abilities and where you can employ them. For example: on my first playthrough, I chose the Knight, the Monk, and the Time Traveler. I was stuck on the Knights puzzle for, I♥♥♥♥♥♥you not, half an hour before I realized that the Knight even HAD a special ability, and I had to use his invincibility to drop through gates of fire. The puzzles are incredibly obtuse if you don't get where to go and what to do, and once you do realize where to go and what to do, they're tedious. There is so much backtracking in this game. Thankfully I grew up playing Zelda, so I have the patience for that kind of thing. Secondly, remember that thing I said about the puzzles being tedious? Well if you're at all interested in completing this game, or even seeing the cave paintings for every character, you're going to play the same puzzles over and over again. Ad nauseum. Thankfully, the character puzzles are still fun, the dialogue is funny and well written, and the narration is pretty entertaining. I just wish that the narrator knew that the Twins' story isn't all that disturbing. Everyone can tell what those ♥♥♥♥ing kids are up to."

Although there are times where dialogue with in-game characters can get annoying when you're running back and forth trying to figure things out.Puzzles were unique and challenging. However, the time travel level, I found, was a little far fetched so it took me a while (and some hints) to get through that one. There were some levels too, that became monotonous & time consuming due to backtracking by having not chosen the appropriate character for a particular task or just simply trying to find clues on what you needed to do.I do like the fact you had to choose the character best suited to solve a particular part of the puzzle and that you can get through the most levels with whichever 3 characters you choose. Some levels aren't available if you don't have the characters to get through them, but you can always go back and replay with new characters - which is nice.All in all, I would definitely recommend playing.

FaustOkay, besides from quotes from BrainyQuote, you probably clicked on this review to see if ""The Cave"" is any good. Well...it can be argued. The Cave is a puzzle solver follwoing 7 adventurers and there quest in The Cave. You'll pick 3 out of the 7 at the start, and play the whole thing with those 3. That's my first gripe with The Cave, it essentially makes you play it 3 times if you want to know all the storys. Yes, there's change in each story, but it is not worth playing 3 times. And, if you passed basic math, you'll notice that 7 isn't divisible by 3, so one character you'll have to play again. I think The Cave should of just given you all 7 to play as, and maybe only take 3 into an area.My first, and most likely only, playthrough I took the Twins, the Hilbilly, and the Time Traveler and still thought that I got what I paid for. Story telling is what The Cave excels at, giving you snipits of a characters backstory at a time. It's intresting to see how screwed up everyone is, and makes you want to find out more.Then there's gameplay, and it's a typical puzzle game. Click this, click that, maybe click that. If you're lost, you play the ""Does this go with this, this, or this"" game, seeing as there isnt a hint system. The only thing negative I can say is that jumping is a little wonky. You'll want to jump to a ledge and accidentally fall to your death. Oh, you die from tall falls, so watch out.Overall, The Cave is just...alright. Is it $15 alright? Ehhhh....do your research. Look into gameplay of it, maybe watch a walkthrough of one person's story. Though, if you love puzzle solvers, buy this."

However, I feel there was a lot of wasted potential in not having a non-corrupt method of solving the puzzles, like the Justine DLC for Amnesia, making it very difficult and possibly requiring knowledge of what went wrong in order to know what to avoid. I thought that maybe I could use other character's powers to circumvent the choices made, but it turns out even if you avoid the actions you were condemned for, they happen anyway. It feels like so much wasted potential. Still for what is there, it's a very solid game and I don't regret playing it."

I didn't think that would be a problem (because I like exploring), but when you need to navigate the same series of sprawling passages over and over again to solve a puzzle -- especially when it's a trial-and-error puzzle that involves a prop you need to re-collect every time you fail -- you start to wonder what the developers were thinking. All the running around gets frustrating, which leads me to the walkthrough page faster than I'd like: if I've got to do so much ditch-digging just to try something that I don't know will work, I'd rather spoil it for myself.But I still recommend the game if you know what you're in for.

The game forces painfully slow backtracking as you figure out a puzzle. Funnily enough, what's worse is when you can't backtrack: Because you frequently pass points of no return accidentally and the game autosaves, you can't have fun exploring an area you've completed because you risk losing access to collectibles or missable achievements. If that is a part of gaming you enjoy, it pretty much forces you to play with a guide open to keep you from missing anything, completely devaluing the collectibles and achievements.However the most aggregious, avoidable design sin is tha for each playthrough you select 3 out of 7 characters (I'll say it again: Three) to take through the campaign, which changes three character specific levels to the game. Did you catch that? The selection of three out of seven? If you are going to obligate replays like this, why not have a number of playable characters that is divisible by three!? This is infuriating and since several puzzles in the cave are permenant fixtures, not character specific, this means you have to play through some puzzles 3 times, and other puzzles (for the two characters you'll play twice) 2 times. Getting all achievements demands a total of 5 playthroughs, but by then you'll have lost all interest.There are some great indie-like titles on Steam, I encourage you to find them instead of buying this one, regardless of the price."

In my opinion, they're some of the funniest, smartest, most entertaining games ever written, even if they sometimes leave you wanting to throw your computer out the window in frustration while trying to figure out exactly why you've had a rubber chicken with a pulley in the middle in your inventory for game hours.The Cave, having been developed by Ron Gilbert and Tim Schaffer's studio, Double FIne, manages to capture some of that charm in a simple yet challenging puzzler.  One playthough takes right around 4-5 hours to complete (depending on how good you are are solving adventure-style puzzles, I guess), and is different depending on which mix of characters you choose to lead through the cave for that session.  Throughout each playthrough, you'll experience a mix of both ""common"" areas (areas that you may encounter regardless of which characters you choose), and character specific areas with puzzles that require the use of that character's special ability to solve.  There is a dark, sarcastic sense of humor that weaves a thread through the entire game, and these character areas, which serve to flesh out the characters' individual back stories (sparse as they may be), are no exception.Fans of the adventure genre, especially the LucasArts games, will find lots to love here.  Aside from the puzzles themselves, there are a ton of small touches throughout the game that pay homage to Gilbert's earliest titles, especially Monkey Island and Maniac Mansion.  The puzzles are, in my opinion, fairly straightforward, though they may take a little time to figure out.  Some other reviewers complained about the lack of direction in the game regarding how to solve the puzzles.  I don't get it--this genre has always been about making the player figure out what to do without too much help from the game itself.  In my opinion, that's always been core to the experience of playing these types of games.  The feeling of accomplishment is much greater when you figure out a particularly challenging puzzle on your own, rather than relying on a cascade of hints.  But, I digress.Having only completed one playthrough so far, I can't comment yet on the game's replayability.  It seems to be there, as different mixes of characters provide a different experience, but I can see how replaying the same common areas over and over again could get old.All in all, I'd give the game an 8/10.  The style, art direction, and writing are excellent.  At the current Summer Sale price of $7.49, it's well worth a purchase if you're a fan of adventure games, or even looking for something that's a little different that can kill a few hours here and there."

I ended up using the Monk's Ability to get through the Knight's section, which was nice but the next time I had the Knight with out the Monk, I had to actually figure out how you were supposed to actually do it.The music is also fantastic, and I will definitely get the soundtrack one of these days.It is slightly annoying that you have to play through the entire game to get a new ""ending"", but I really like what happens when one of your characters get the bad ending, because it was really affective in making me feel bad for getting their bad ending."

The writing is witty, and generally the strongest part of the game.  The downside is that it's pretty exhausting having to play through the game three times in order to access all of the characters' special levels, given the amount of game that you must play through (all of the regular levels) which is completely unchanged regardless of which characters you play with.  The monotony creeps up fairly high given that this is a game you're largely expected to replay, not necessarily to get the best ending or achievements, but just to play all of the levels.Ultimately, a fun little diversion at sale prices, and worth a tour thanks to its humour, but I would have been highly disappointed in it if I had paid regular price.

And look -- there is key. Oh, what should you do?"". The platforming is also on the easy side and mainly a way to have something to do while ferrying said key to said door.The environments are visually interesting. Each character has their own ability, and a unique game section, most of which have some combination of plot/backstory related to that character.  That's the highlight of the game; it is fun to see the special areas, and a few of them have genuinely interesting puzzles.Except there is one extremely annoying aspect: You can take three characters per game. So to experience all seven stories, you will have to play the game three times -- and the common areas aren't interesting enough to make play number three be other than a drag. Oh, and if you avoid spoilers by not reading how to do the achievements until after your play-through, it is quite likely to need a fourth play-through.So, it is a mixed bag. You will have to decide whether the annoying ones outweigh the potential fun."
,Recommended,221810,13731795,"Posted: 30 December, 2014",all,Audeez,"I didn't buy The Cave immediately when it was originally released and this is mainly because I'm not a Ron Gilbert, Tim Schafer, or Double Fine fanboy. I like all of those things, but the only Ron Gilbert game I ever played was Maniac Mansion (which was great, but I was like 8 years old), and both Tim Schafer and Double Fine have shown me that they can do as much bad as good sometimes (cough ... Brutal Legend .. cough). I did eventually acquire The Cave though and having finally played it, found I enjoyed it.Right up front, the presentation of this game is top notch. The art, controls (I used an Xbox controller), and sound were excellent. The core conceit of the game design (choosing 3 out of 7 characters to go through the cave) I felt was a bit lacking though. The game makes concessions for your not having certain characters (and their abilities) with you and with the exception of completely optional cave painting unlocks and very minor shortcuts, your choice of characters is purely narrative. This isn't horrible, but it means you'll have to play through the game 3 times to get all the character stories and content, repeating the non-character specific areas of the game each time.The actual control of the multiple characters works rather well and for the most part the puzzles designed to rely on them are interesting as opposed to frustrating. My one gripe with the controlling multiple characters is the backtracking that takes place for each one in many instances. While there are checkpoint-like locations where the two other characters will instantly appear at the side of your controlled character in order to alleviate the tedium of treading the same ground again, some puzzles still require going back and forth through the same area with two or more characters in order to solve a puzzle.In the end, The Cave is a pleasant blend of adventure and puzzle genres with what I would consider to be an entry-level to intermediate difficulty. What it may lack in complexity it makes up for in charm and I'd recommend it if you're looking for a mild puzzler with good personality."

The first play through is great, every run after that becomes redundant. I wouldn't normally focus on this, but since a handful of achievements for the game or dependent on you replaying it (i.e., alternate endings for each character, which would require you to play at least 6 times) you'd hope they would introduce new intermediaries (that prospector wore on me even just the first time around). Even if you don't care about achievements, you'd have to play three separate times just to see every playable character. I love double fine, but man does this game stink.

,Recommended,221810,13767165,"Posted: 1 January, 2015",all,Sickafant,"The Cave is less of a full fledged adventure game and more of a compartmentalized adventure game. You choose 3 of 7 characters to enter the cave and each character will have their own puzzle level with 3 constant puzzle levels that the player must always play through.For the old school adventure aficionados, the Cave won't be a challenge and may not live up to the experiences of games such as Monkey Island. For the rest the Cave sits as an enjoyable puzzle game with simple control schemes and interesting puzzle levels.There are 7 total characters each with a different special ability, the only issue I have with the abilities is that most of them are really only used in their specific levels, otherwise some of the abilities are pretty useless through out the rest of the game. There are characters that will allow you to get through certain puzzles quicker than normal but no puzzle requires a character outside of the main character for that story. Each character has their own story to tell, mostly told through their own level as well as through the storyboards that you pick up throughout the game.Due to only being able to play 3 characters at a time, multiple playthroughs of the game are needed to see everyone's ending. This only causes problems when you have to play the default puzzles that always show up in the game. It would have been better if there was say 6 default puzzles and 3 random ones would be dropped in everytime you played to keep the player guessing as to which puzzle was next. I got bored of the default puzzles real quick after playthrough 5 and up.The main dialogue in the game comes from the Cave itself and is really well written. Sure you'll get bored of it after playing through the game several times but on first play through it's enjoyable to listen to.The Cave is an adventure game worth playing but don't come in expecting it to replicate the old school adventure games."

You have to ""think like a developer"" to solve item-grab combinations, but you can figure out the rhythm and logic easily enough. Tons of backtracking and not much replayability, unless you want to complete special levels for certain characters.Not much in the way of spoilers here, but there are no real ""moral"" choices. You just follow the stories, discovering the dark hearts of the characters. In my case, the hillbilly (who burns down a carnival since he can't have the one he loves), the scientist (who launches a nuke due to her greed), and the twins (who dabble in using rat poison to get their way)."

,Recommended,221810,32112555,Posted: 1 June,all,Indurok,"Video Version of this review:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18MOwnrZEO4You have your choice of seven different characters to play as in this game, but you can only choose three. You can choose between the Knight, the Hillbilly, the Time Traveler, the Scientist, the Adventurer, the Twins, and the Monk.Each character has their own unique abilities, but seeing as I’ve only played as the Knight, Hillbilly, and Time Traveler, I’ll only explain theirs. The Knight can create some kind of magic shield to protect himself from all kinds of danger, like fall damage, fire, and being shot by enemies. The Hillbilly creates a bubble around his head. This helps him to stay underwater for a long time and not run out of air. And the Time Traveler, can sort of teleport herself a few feet ahead, so you can get past barred gates.I could have looked to see what everyone else does at the beginning of the game, but I didn’t even know the characters had abilities at the time, so I can’t go back now.Basically, you are supposed to explore a cave, which apparently can talk, since it acts as the narrator. Each character is looking for something, and has their own little area of the cave that sort of tells their story. The Knight, for example, involves kings, princesses, and dragons. That’s all I’m gonna say about that. I don’t like to spoil anything.There are also these markings on the wall that show you images of the characters, giving them a bit of backstory. Each of these characters seems to have some sort of troubled past. Is Double Fine known for making games about characters like this? Because they did the same thing in Psychonauts.There was a part of the game where I have to flip three switches, but the gate closes when you let go, so I didn’t know what to do about that part. It turns out that was actually for the Twins to go through. I thought I was unable to progress, until I found out online that you can actually bypass this area by taking a side path straight into the Time Traveler’s area. So at least that’s a thing.There are a lot of puzzles in this game, some that require multiple people. Some are easy, and some I had to constantly leave the game to look up a solution for. Some of the solutions seemed kinda ridiculous to me at first, but then again, I guess I should have paid attention to the way the camera moves when I get near a certain puzzle. So I guess I’m just stupid sometimes. Big surprise.You can move your character by clicking anywhere on the screen, using WASD, or the arrow keys. The only time I use the arrow keys is when I’m swimming as the Hillbilly, because it’s not easy using WASD when you have to hold “Q” to keep the bubble around your head.If there’s anything I really don’t like about this game, its when you need to solve a puzzle with 2 or 3 characters, and the other two characters are all the way on the other side of the area, so you have to move each character individually. This is rather slow and a bit boring. I don’t know if this is a co-op game, but if is, I think I’d recommend playing it with someone because of this.It’s not really that easy for me to judge this game, because of the puzzles, seeing as I am absolutely terrible at puzzles. But I think that the game is worth a look, if anyone is better at puzzles than I am, and I’m sure everyone is."

Great, step right up and play a silly adventure puzzle platformer that will probably make you question whether or not you're playing the good guys the entire time.However, if you want to 100% the game, you're kinda screwed. Every time you play it you get to choose three characters to come with you. These choices change what three stages you have to make it through to get to the end. The first time you run through each character's stage it's a fun puzzle to figure out and escape. The second time you are mostly just annoyed that you have to go through the steps again. The third time you hate every second of it. To get every achievement you have to run through twice with every character and a minimum of three times with the hillbilly. This quickly becomes even more torturous when you then have to make it through the entire game without dying once with any of your characters. This is nearly impossible, and usually ends in you making it all the way to the end of the game and accientally falling off something and having to start over after three hours of grueling gameplay came up for naught. I have played every character at least seven times, trying desperately to make it through without a death. I gave up after a particularly annoying death in which I was at the actual end of the game, after each of the stages, and I managed to fall off the ladder and die.Uninstalled, never looked back."

,Recommended,221810,29915238,Posted: 13 February,all,vernonleon,"The gameplay is fluid and straightforward, and I like the visual style of the game. I ran into some glitches, but that might have been due to my controller (SteelSeries Stratus XL). The puzzles are so-so. Even though there are different ways of solving some of the main puzzles with different characters, there's nothing that requires a particular character to solve. I hear you saying it now- ""but that's necessary for this type of game."" No, they could have spent a bit of time on developing slightly altered puzzles to make it so only one member of your party could complete a key part of the puzzle regardless of what characters make up your party, and adding a bit of logic so it works. Instead, you have to complete the same puzzles with little variation over and over again to get through all of the character levels. This all ties in to my next concern, which was the brevity of the game. I would like to have seen more puzzles, or at least variations as I said earlier. In spite of all of these negatives, I had fun playing and would recommend the game. The characters were all interesting, and I was reminded of a quote I once read ""if all these people were at peace, they wouldn't be doing yoga."" The Cave's voice and commentary was priceless. I also enjoyed how some of the artwork was quite reminiscent of Psychonauts, one of my fav games and part of why I jumped on this game. With a little bit of extra time devoted to developing sadditional levels and adding a little bit of extra logic, The Cave could be great."

When most other platformers become boring, this game draws you back in to delight in the dark storyline over and over again."
