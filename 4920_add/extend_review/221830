Much of the artwork flows like an oil painting plus the animations give it an extra level of depth and personality. It is obvious the writers and voice actors had a lot of fun in their roles. The game puts several Star Wars parodies in the storyline as well as a few references to Portal. With two characters to control it's almost like playing two stories in one.Overall, it's a mildly funny game that doesn't get overly difficult."

However, it's significantly shorter than its sequel. Nevertheless, I found its puzzles and story much better and enjoyable.The Book of Unwritten Tales: The Critter Chroniclesis definitely not even close to a masterpiece but it's still a quite decent point-and-click game."
,Not Recommended,221830,17310432,"Posted: 30 July, 2015",all,Sweetz,"I am a big fan of the the original Book of Unwritten Tales and Critter Chronicles is certainly not a terrible game as adventure games go, but the thumb indicates whether I recommended it (not that it's an outright bad game!) and I unfortunately I just can't recommend Critter Chronicles - mainly due to the puzzle quality.The original game keeps a nice balance between the puzzles being relatively intuitive, yet not quite so blatantly obvious that there's nothing to it.  Generally I could always figure out what needed to be done once I found the right items, without resorting to much trial and error.  Critter Chronicles, however, strays a bit too far into the territory of some of the more egregious 90s adventure game leaps of logic where the solution is stumbled upon only by exhausting all possible options.  More than likely at some point will need to resort to the process of trying to use every item on every other item and hotspot - which is made even more frustrating by having to rather slowly transfer items between two characters, one at a time.Forgetting the puzzles, the game still retains much of the charm of BoUT.  It's still well acted (though Critter's ""dialog"" did start to grate on me as the game went on) and nice to look at, but the cast and overall scope of the game is much reduced compared to BoUT.  It comes out feeling a bit thin as a result.To a certain extent it seems perhaps a bit unfair to hold it up to the standards of the excellent original BoUT, but that's naturally what one would compare it against, since Critter Chronicles is presumably meant for fans of BoUT.  The bottom line is unfortunately that all but the most fanatical of BoUT fans could safely skip Critter Chronicles without feeling like they missed out.  I don't regret playing the game, but knowing what I do now, I wouldn't regret having skipped it either."

This was done better in Day of the Tentacle back in the 90s. The makers of Critter Chronicles know about DOTT, since there is a reference to it in the game.Speaking of, there are way too many pop culture references in the game, replacing actual humor and not really fitting in with the setting established in the previous game"

However, that is not the case with ""TBoUT: the Critter Chronicles"" which feels like a failed experiment, prior TBoUT2, for testing various game concepts.The two difficulty options ""normal"" and ""hard"" causes far too complicated puzzles on the harder setting. Other puzzles gets harder by having all spoken clues removed. The normal setting is playable but sometimes a puzzle just ""ends"" without any visible progress feedback since the ""hard part"" has been cut.The gibberish speak from Critter itself overstays its welcome fairly rapidly and I quickly tried to maximize the playtime using captain Nate. The other two playable characters from TBoUT1/2 Wilbur Weatherwane and Ivo, are unfortunately not present.Essentially the Critter Chronicles feels much more unpolished and rushed in comparison to TBoUT1 and 2."
,Not Recommended,221830,13007289,"Posted: 19 November, 2014",all,Bolasdagrk,"Overall, I like the series.  Critter Chronicles is fun, and reminds me of classic point click games I played as a kid.  The problem with the game, and a reason I wouldn't recommend the game, is to those who have little patience for unfixed bugs.   This game will crash at the Yeti cave, and there is no way around it.  So basically you can only play half way.The original ""Book of unwritten tails (BoUT): part 1"" had a bug where I had to load someone elses game in order to continue playing, which defeats the purpose, but the bright side is... I could actually finish BoUT: 1.  No matter how nice BoUT: critter chronicles is, the fact that I can't continue playing it after the yeti cave kind of destroys the credibility of a game.Update:  I posted the original review Nov 19, 2014.  It is currently May 17, 2016. No one has contacted me or commented on this review to inform ""me/other forums"" as of why this yeti crash continues to occur.  It could be because I have an updated Windows (10), but they have no interest in their buyers or helping anyone out with these issues in the games. So, this also gets me to be very skeptical on considering ""Book of Unwritten Tales 2.""  Which by the way, also has complaints about many bugs when you look up their reviews/forums. This is the only reason why I did not purchase it immediately.   Just Sad."

Beautiful backdrops, excellent animation, beautiful soundtrack, great voice acting, fun puzzles, lovable characters.  They fixed the bug with inventory slow down.  Steam achievements!

You can still turn on the Show Points so you won't have pixel hunting even in HARD mode.But the riddles are difficult enough in front of the first part of the series.If you play the game in normal mode you 'll have more hints by the characters and you 'll miss a couple of riddles. Generally the game does NOT change much. So play it at hard anyway!The graphics are about the same with the difference of the settings. You don't have complicated settings like AA Anisotropic or Antialiasing. You choose between smoothness and Picture quality and that's it.  Well in the first part the antialising thing mattered . I had it in 8X. Here the differences are small to nothing. Try ""Low"" in smoothness and ""Medium"" in picture quality. The last one sets the textures sent to the graphic card. If set to the best it will sent uncompressed textures directly to the graphics card so even the best cards may NOT handle some scenes and you ll have glitches. You have more vivid colors but the difference is that and ONLY that. So set it to medium and enjoy the game with more earth colors. The graphics are 3D Indie so the colors are vivid enough anyway.I wasn't amazed by the story BUT is better than the fisrt part and you have the critter to break the ice and makes you laugh. But still is better from the first. I enjoyed this game much MORE than the first one.All the others like sounds , story , characters and more.... Come on.. You play an adventure and NOT the final episode of Call of Duty or other game to see things in Reality. We have imagination as players and all the game things are MORE than OK.To all adventurers...

Luckily, your options are limited enough that you can exhaust your options and solve them by trial and error. But that doesn't feel rewarding at all. And that's the case with I'd say 3/4 of the puzzles, or more.The game has a few major bugs that probably won't ever get fixed. The 2 biggest ones are one that makes the game crash at a certain point (there's a workaround that worked for me and others posted in the forums), and one that corrupts your savefile if you save at the wrong screen. So make sure you check the forums so you know what to be prepared for if you play this game.TL;DR: Despite its good parts, I can't recommend this game. If you have it in your library and are already a fan of the series, you might as well try it, but don't be afraid to use a guide every now and then. Just make sure you interact with everything to see how the characters react -- that's where most of the fun lies."

I figured out how to workaround it after searching some solutions on forums. Here are some common workarounds you can try (may or may not work for you depending on individual):1. Disable steam overlay2. Verify game authenticity in settings3. In the Yeti cave, once you get to ""that part"" that keeps crashing, first youtie the string on the pepper shaker and place on the scales, then once you put the can on the scales IMMEDIATELY click the lampshadeto solve the puzzle and trigger the rest of the animation.Overall 9/10 recommend this game (had to take some points away cos of the crashing issue)."

,Recommended,221830,28062149,"Posted: 29 November, 2016",all,James20,"The Critter Chronicles is old school Point n Click adventure done right.  Simple story, excellent characters, and the most random and nonsensical ways of solving puzzles all while being humorous and referential.There really isn't much to analyze about the game.  There’s no deep story or allegorical moral, just a straight adventure. But I've given too much credit to other games in this regards.  The Critter Chronicles is very clear on what your goal is in chapter and even in the subchapters.  Hold Space and tells you the puzzle you should be figuring out.  That's actually ground breaking when compared to other games that don't reveal what your goal is until after you do it.The characters are great as well.  This story lends itself more towards a Star Wars parody with Nate being a reluctant Han while Critter is an amalgamation of Chewbacca, ET and several Muppets. Though, the love interest is definitely a Leia Organa clone, she plays opposite of Critter.  There aren't many characters but the ones included they got right.Puzzle aren't too hard. Nate drops verbally hints as what to do, but even if you missed one they aren't so devious that you couldn't figure out with a bit of time. A few puzzle though left me frustrated. At one point I had run through all the possible combinations of interacting with objects that broke down a checked a gameboomers.  In bright Red Letters the guide pointed out I need to examine something I already had in my inventory because that would change it. That was annoying. I also accidentally skipped a puzzle not realizing the order I was supposed to do things. A few other puzzle were tough but not Goat level.The real reason to love this game though is the referential humor. It pokes fun of 80s nostalgia while also being an homage. Star wars and Harry Potter references are clear, but a surprising one was day of the tentacle. Lots of little things were included that show a lot of love in the game.My only real criticism is the lack of customization of controls. The mouse speed adjustment and middle click to reveal hotspots would have been a big plus.Overall, it’s another excellent game in the series, a little short but if you like classic Point n Click adventures this one is for you."

I have to agree with other reviewers here and say that while this game has some gorgeous visuals, having 3 chapters out of 5 taking place in the same 4-5 screens hurts  the game significantly. Especially when the puzzles in those chapters are the least intuitive in the game.For example the chapter in which you get to play Critter for the first time - I wasn't really sure what I was trying to achieve so I spent a lot of time running from screen to screen interacting with everything I could. The solutions aren't as farfetched here as I felt they were in Deponia though. Maybe I'm just generally dense.As for the story, I still enjoyed it very much even though it is fairly classic. I was especially delighted by some of the references and I laughed at every altercation Nate and Zazi had.Would I recommend this game?

But you will also find that the most of the gameplay involves walking back and forth between limited set of places, while moving your mouse cursor all over the screen with frustration, hoping to find some missed hotspot.For a modern title, it pays notably little attention in mitigating such typical problems which pervade point & click adventure games.So, if you feel like you are stuck, I'd like to suggest to try combining items in random manner or scrubbing the whole screen thorougly with your mouse, because there are number of not very logical puzzles, and very hard to find hotspots throughout the game.But still, I have to conclude my review by assuring you that it's one of the better made classic adventure game you can get these days.And the at very least, it also has PENGUINS and THE TENTACLE (yes, that purple one you remember from the old days).

Most of the puzzles are inventory based, with a few minigames thrown in. None of the puzzles are too hard, although I did get stuck once on a minigame and had to consult a walkthrough. About half of the game was completed by my nine-year-old with a little help. I think this is a great game to play with your kids, they love the sophomoric humor. Some of the jokes are laugh-out-loud funny. Overall I thought this game was a little more polished and clever than the first one. I definitely recommend playing BoUT first before playing this game, since the story makes more sense this way. Overall the game was very entertaining for the story and the comedy, the puzzles keep you busy but are not all that challenging."

The story line is a little weak without the knowledge of TBUT, and it doesn't have the same charm to make up for such weaknesses, The script is still good, but playing as Critter for such an extended period of time got a bit tedious for me.

It is a shorter experience (8h vs 13h for me) and not with as many characters. Which is certainly a weakpoint in my opinion. Since they cost about the same I would certainly recommend the original game over this one.The story and voice acting are pretty good... though the parody stuff and the ""do you see what I am referencing? Do you? Look closer! Are you sure you see it!?!"" type of pop culture referencing from the original game still keeps a lot of the characters from being as amusing as they could have been. And unfortunately Nate's and the Critter's backstories do not really flesh them out as characters very well.The puzzles do suffer quite severly from the same simplified inventory system that Unwritten Tales, but I think to an even higher degree. Since it is so easy to combine the right objects together and find where they are to be placed (only the right ones will give the option to combine except in a few, very rare, circumstances when you get a witty remark instead), they seem to have tried to compensate by having really ridiculous and stupid solutions to problems. This often means you are combinging things and placing things without logic or reason, but only because you have an item and a place.Obviously this is a problem in a lot of point and clicks, but the Critter Chronicles really take it to the next level. Since it is so easy (even on Hard) this is not so much frustrating though as... unsatisfactory. It gets a bit better when you are able to control the critter as well since this does force you to think a little bit more about what you want to use where... but the barrier is still quite low and it becomes a case of moving all items between characters to find who will do the thing you want them to do.In the end I will recommend this game (if you've already played the original and liked it), but I would suggest playing it for the characters more than the gameplay. You will not find a challenging puzzle experience here if you're a veteran puzzle player, but maybe a laugh here and there."

Animation- I always thought this was one of the best new looking adventure game series to come along. I love the back grounds and animations for the characters, it really is top notch.2. voice acting- the voice acting is still top notch with all the VAs doing a nice job with their parts3.  Jokes- the jokes and inside gags are funny, but to be honest not near as funny as the first book of unwritten tales.CONS1. story- the story is pretty bland and features only two of the four main characters in Nate and the critter. And even thought Nate has started to grow on me some, He is still my least favorite character.3. Game length- This game is a lot shorter than the first game, I clocked in at a little under 9 hrs, and I explored all options.4. puzzles- while the first game had too easy of puzzles,this one has harder and sometimes down right frustrating puzzle. there is one in chapter in 4 where the puzzles either are not explained at all or explained very poorly.5. bugs- I encountered a game breaking bug where it would crash at the same spot every time in chapter two for no reason. I eventually found a work around to fix it. It seems king art doesnt like to patch its older games, as I have seen numerous customers of their's report problems to them without getting a response.closing commentsYall are probably wondering why Im reccomending this game when the cons out score the pros, well the game is still a fun and solid adventure, just not near as good as the first game in any respect, I would reccomend this game to fans of the series but only at a discounted price.

It is a shorter story lasting around 8 to 10 hours depends on your play style, and tells the prequel story of how Nate and Critter first met each other, and their adventures that takes place before the original game.Once again it is another light-hearted tale that pokes fun at itself and pays homage to lots of fantasy and RPG stereotypes and old adventure games. In fact one of the puzzle solution near the end of the game would not make much sense to someone who had not played a certain Lucasarts adventure game before. For those who have played it however, it certainly a funny and nostalgic treat.While this game is shorter then its predecessor, the puzzles felt alot more devious and require you to think out of the box (at least for the hard mode version). More then once I had to consult a walkthrough as puzzle solutions can be a little cryptic.The annoyances that plague its predecessor continue with this game such as not being able to make the character walk faster, and the typical ""mouse-over everything on the screen until something is clickable"" type of situations. This game doesn't end in a cliffhanger, but it would have been nice if it was tied directly to the first game.Overall Rating: 8.0 / 10Definitely pick this up if you enjoyed the first game in the series. For newcomers, I recommend playing the first game to better understand and appreciate some of the story elements in this game even though it is a prequel.
