Well you play Stanley, who works in an office. And one day Stanley realises everyone else has disappeared and it is up to him to find out why ... or is it?

,Recommended,221910,17939792,"Posted: 8 September, 2015",all,Jadarma,"OverviewThe Stanley Parableis a one of a kind game. You play as Stanley, an employee that has to press buttons. When suddenly, you stop and head out your office. A narrator describes your adventure and it's up to you to listen to him or not. Explore the office building and make different choices every playthrough and unlock all of the many endings possible!The Pros:Beautiful- The graphics are decent, the lightning glorious, and walking through the building is pleasant to the eye.Choices- The best thing a game can do for you is let you be in control. The Stanley Parable makes you make your own story, every step of the way, and unlocking a different ending every time. Such decisions include taking the left or right door, going to the meeting or not, or turning off the evil machine... or not. Every action has a thing to say for the ending.Comical- The narrator says things that are sometimes very funny, the way he reacts when you disobey him and the scenes you encounter have some very rich monologue.Deep- It might not look like this the first time you play, but as you uncover different endings you will see the hidden meaning behind Stanley's story. The writing is very cleverly done, the existance of the narrator poses further questions, and the very nature of reality bends amongst different endings.The Cons:Repetitive up to a point- As the story forks at different intersections, you are bound to repeat parts of it until you reach the branching point. Some of the paths require waiting for long narrations to play, so you might become a little impatient along the process.Unconventional Achievements- Most achievements require a degree of witt to figure out what they want (or read a guide) but there are some that are really unnecessary, such as playing the game for the entire duration of a Tuesday, implying either BIOS Time Changing or leaving the PC idle for 24 hours, theUnachiveable, which requires configuration file tweaks and theGo Outsidewhich makes you not play for... 5 years. Of course, circumventable with a little sly techniques, but they are not achievements related to the game. They don't track progress or skill, they're just there to mess with you and waste your time.Conclusion:The Stanley Parable stand out amongst the rest of pshycological narratives and really puts the player in a position of power over his destiny, or at least gives him a very powerful delusion about it. Buy with confidence, it is an enjoyable experience.If you enjoyed this review and want to see more of my work,consider joining my groupandfollow my curatorpage!

,Recommended,221910,7753993,"Posted: 25 November, 2013",all,[AReV]BavarianGod,"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oADQMrDfeXIThe Stanley Parable began life as a mod for Half Life 2 and was recently updated and released on steam with achievements, more story branches and shiny new visuals. It places players in the mundane shoes of Stanley, a corporate desk jockey who is placed in an office in front of a computer where he punches buttons for a living. One day his monitor goes blank and the other corporate drones that he shares the office building with disappear and so begins your Journey as Stanley.  Being the dull chap that he is, Stanley himself doesn't offer much ion the area of entertainment, but a charming English narrator provides the personality and humor necessary to make The Stanley Parable an enjoyable experience. The narrator provides player with instructions, becoming almost like a GPS device that has confused itself for a raconteur.Where most games are about following the rules, The Stanley Parable is best enjoyed when breaking them. If the narrator says go right, you will certainly find more satisfaction in taking a left and listening as the narrator's knickers become twisted by your wanton disobedience. By taking these divergent paths you will find yourself faced with one of the game's 15 different conclusions. Each conclusion revels something a bit different about Stanley and they range from conspiratorial to surreal. The game plays a few tricks on you by repeating rooms endlessly or swapping out props on the fly truing an office into an apartment space. All of this is rendered in a simple and clean visual style. The color palette is muted to reflect just what a dull and miserable existence our pal Stanley has and the props are equally generic creating an appropriately stodgy atmosphere. As advertised the texture work adds far more detail than could be found in the original mod and overall the HD remix has much greater visual appeal.So is The Stanley Parable a biting satire of the way in which modern games tell their story by allowing us to control a character on a predetermined path where deviation is punished? Is it a parody of the life of the average key punching office drone? Or, is it just an excuse to have a rather cheeky British man tell us what to do? The answer is that it's all of these... and none of them. It's a game that will give each of it's players a different take away. Each playthrough lasts between 15 minutes and a half hour. This doesn't sound like a lot of playtime, and it isn't but there is a tremendous degree of satisfaction in finding new ways to get the game to react to what you are or, in some cases, are not doing. Seeing all 15 endings without consulting a guide will probably take around 3 hours. These 15 endings are not Mass Effect 3 style endings either—they are wholly unique and there are a couple of treats for gamers to be uncovered. Ultimately, The Stanley Parable will not be everyone's cup of tea, but it holds a very special spot in the gaming landscape. It's a testament to satire and unconventional design as well as manipulating gamer's expectations. In short it's the antithesis of it's key punching dullard protagonist."

Stanley works in a dead end job carrying out mindless tasks; and the story is told by one of the best narratives I have ever heard. Graphics isn't an important feature here, but that being said, it looks really nice.The design of the world is very well done, you are essentially in an office building, but it does a very clever thing where you can sometimes be walking around in a circle, and then all of a sudden the world changes, and you are somewhere else. This made the experience feel more real to me. You can make this game as easy or as difficult as you want. There is fifteen different stories and endings to the Stanley Parable, each of them is amazingly written, probably one of, if not the best story in gaming I've experienced and well worth playing.  It has taken me almost seven hours to play through all of the endings, and do all but one of the achievements. After you have played all of the endings though, there is probably no need to go replay any of the game again.Is the game worth £9, 99, sure?

,Recommended,221910,12627318,"Posted: 25 October, 2014",all,CorvusCorax,"Stanley Parable is a unique, if not atypical game. You play as employee number 427; an employee who only pushes buttons as per the instructions of his superiors. Stanley, however, does not receive any orders one day, therefore, he gets up from his desk and starts investigating what exactly has happened.And this is where you take control of him in this FPS which uses the well-known game engine called Source. Our protagonist immediately notices that nobody else is present in the office - he passes empty cubicles and corridors trying to find the answers.There are no weapons in this game. No NPCs you can interact with. No objectives. No goals. Stanley Parable is about exploration. And this exploration, this journey of our white-collar worker is accompanied by the narrator's voice.However, you will notice that the narrator tells Stanley, in advance, which door he is supposed to take. But you can refuse the command and go to the direction you desire. And this is the most crucial part of this game: it is about choices. Your choices.And these choices can yield you at least a dozen endings. Endings that are funny, serious, sarcastic and some are even meant to be no more than mere easter eggs.This is not something you'll spend dozens of hours with. No, Stanley Parable can be completed in a mere 30 minutes, still, it's worth the journey and the appreciation."

You choose whether to obey him or not. If you continue to disobey him, the narrator becomes angry with you and reacts differently depending on what you have done. The narrator is hilarious when you aggravate him! He breaks the fourth wall many times, stating that he knows he's in a video game.I also really like how much there is to explore in the game. While it may feel confined, if you truly think outside the box there are tons of things to discover. Hidden rooms, narrator soliloquies, and other secrets are everywhere. Even when you think you glitched the game, the narrator scolds you for trying to break his masterpiece. Not to mention there are about 20 endings to the game to discover. (Some are very hard to find though.)I think the price is a bit high for the game, so try to get it on sale. I got it for $4 and it is definitely worth a few bucks more than that.

It is one of those ""first-person walking"" games in which you wander around a completely non-violent experience exploring the environment and unravelling the story, like Dear Esther.You are Stanley, an office worker. Stanley has the job to push buttons on command until some day those commands abruptly stop. Stanley is leaving his desk to investigate, his actions are directed by a narrator who guides him through the office facility to discover the truth.The Stanley Parable is a game about walking from A to B. As you approach a pair of doors, the narrator will indicate that Stanley takes the left one. Whether you do and how you decide to follow up your revolt or acquiescence, tilts the game towards wildly different conclusions. A playthrough may only take minutes, but The Stanley Parable has a lot of choices and a lot of different endings. It will take a few hours to see everything and every ending.At each of the game's many intersections, you can follow the narrator's instruction or ignore it and face the consequences of your petty resistance. Each combination of choices leads to something unique. Some of these ""endings"" are lighthearted, some are absurd and many centre around the narrator's attempts to get back to his story.The Stanley Parable has not the best Source Engine graphics. Many of the environments are bland, but deliberately so. Delightful hidden details show their faces everywhere if you are willing to look.The best part of The Stanley Parable is the voice acting of the omnipotent Narrator. He plays witness to every move which do you make. From a kindly, yet firm, guiding hand at the start of the game to an acerbic wit if you ignore him, the Narrator really adds a soul to the world of The Stanley Parable.I enjoyed the game and I would recommend the game to people who want to try out something different instead of the normal games, but I would advice everyone to try out The Stanley Parable Demo before buying the game. It will tell you nothing about the main game, but you should then be able to decide if the game is something for you or not.If you should still be unsure, you can also try the free mod, to make your final decision.

Stop reading if you want to have a fresh experience with the game. Everything below is my speculation, don't take them as definitive facts.The Stanley Parable is everything and beyond video games. It's a giant commentary on todays game development philosophy. Throughout its unexpected span and twisty narrative, it has a clear message - there are problems with narrative in video games, which we have not addressed yet.In recent years we have seen a great amount of open world/sand box games. But there hasn't been shortage in linear games with strict control over players actions. Invisible walls or direct threatening by the game if you go off the map, even in scenarios where the level design suggests more freedom than the available and, but not limited to - bugging out the whole game or level by reaching unexpected locations are common practices in multiplayer and even in singleplayer games since decades.The layout of the office (which is briefly explained in the museum, behind the scenes room) is designed and created with the mind that the dialogue and attention span of the player would balance and lead to the first sense of conflict - the two doors.This first dilemma is presented geniously - with a confident and calm voice. At this point the narrator is still following the hardcoded written script. Which is what I describe as the main and simple story the whole Stanely Parable is based around - there is a problem, the protagonist decides to end the tyranny of the evil force and it concludes with a happy ending.The simple story has cartoonish elements. Toward the end of it, it cultivates exaggerated tone and willingly becomes boring, it's purpose is to show the most basic and at the same time intriguing story. But only if the player obeys/follows the steps the given by the narrator.Not obeying the narrative, leads to all sorts of interesting results, which ultimately don't explain the whole picture of The Stanley Parable, which is left to players imagination. The game doesn't feel the need to address any of the questions which the audience asks frantically after playing it. The same happened in the demonstration, particularly in the 'Escape elevator' sequence.Throughout the exploration/ending hunting there are many sections where the nature of narration and design in games is examined and often made fun out of.Many actions, which are not part of the hardcoded script, of the player are directly commentated by the narrator.Like the 'Broom closet' - this room has no place in the whole game. In traditional game narrative it would be a waste of time - there isn't a collectable or extra life and if the player decides to explore it, the game would punish him for doing so. But here, the comedic nature of TSP rewards the player for paying attention to it, even if it is only a piece of dialogue.Achievements are another device with which the The Stanley Parable mocks the current video game industry. Take the 'Click on door 430 five times' for example  - a great way to address the ridiculous amount of pointless achievements in some games. Or 'Unachievable' - an obvious phantom which doesn't have a solution. It is created solely that particular part of the player audience grinds through the game, desperately trying to get it.So, how does The Stanley Parable get away with being so rude to every aspect in the modern video game industry, while being part of it?Its complete and constant self awareness makes TSP simply perfect. It is written and executed exceptionally well. It deflects most of the criticism, directed at it, simply by being one."

Anyone buying it as such will be sorely disappointed.  What it IS is a brilliant commentary on not just gaming culture, but the thought processes of gamers themselves.It really is brilliantly done, and superbly executed.  As a gamer, I felt a strange air of danger and menace throughout, as if something was going kick off and lead to some sort of battle for survival, and the game plays with this notion throughout, offering a number of different ""endings"".  The ""good"" ending (which I won't spoil) is a very well observed satire on game design and player choice.It really is hard to write anything about the game without spoiling something!  All I can really say is - it's not for everyone.  Some people may look down on people who don't enjoy it or don't get it and that's not entirely fair.  The ideas and concept explored aren't hugely complex, but probably require a high level of self awareness and self criticism on the part of the player.In summary - this is a sublime mix of art, gaming and genuine entertainment."

Ah, the beautiful lines that you crash your bike into in a game of Light Cycles. They were good lines. And as time went past, games got more lines. Then one day we decided that lines weren't enough and we had some triangles and we put the triangles together and we made videogames with triangles instead of dots and instead of lines and oh, what did we lose?

After playing it through a few times, I believe that the game just simply isn't worth the money, perhaps on a very generous sale, but even £4.99 for that matter is a bit of a stretch. While I really admire the concept behindThe Stanley Parable, which is what drove me to purchace the game in the first place, I personally found it to be dull and disappointing.The Stanley Parablehas lots of positive(yet, unhelpful)reviews, which ultimately leads anybody to believe that it's a fun game, that is the main purpose of a game, right? Unfortunately for me, the game just didn't live up to the expectations set, so I am relieved that I didn't end up paying full price for it(£9.99 in my case), if I had, I'd certainly have felt cheated, let me elaborate.The game itself is appealing because it is genuinely interesting and refreshingly different, the trailer and the highest rated user reviews don't really give much information away because it genuinely would ruin the experience, but all in all, this is not agame, it is alecture.The Stanley Parableattempts to convey a message about game design and the illusion of choice, and while this message is conveyed well through the narration(great voice acting)it is in no way a fun experience. Sure, some of the dialog can be amusing, but that for me is the only positive factor.There is no real gameplay and there are no real objectives,The Stanley Parableoffers nothing more than a few hours of exploration around repetitive and dull scenery, waiting for the next line of dialog to pop up more often than not. I can't speak for everybody, but having to sit and listen for instructions on what to do next is not my idea of a fun experience, and even though the project is very well made and has a good concept behind it, I believe that you would have had the exact same experience just watching a play through of it.Fans of the game tend to use the argument that if you don't enjoyThe Stanley Parable, it's because you don't understand it, which I'm afraid is simply untrue. I understood the messages conveyed and I think the idea and crafting behind the game is clever and very unique, but all in all, I regret spending money on agamethat turned out to be anunsatisfying lecture. The reason I buy games is to have a fun experience, and unfortunately I didn't achieve that at all playing this one.I firmly stand by my suggestion to avoid paying the full asking price forThe Stanley Parable, but again, it's all down to choice. If you do feel compelled to buy it regardless of any negative reviews in favour of the (mostly) vague positive reviews, don't expect any actual fun gameplay, because I honestly believe there isn't any to be found here.Please note that this review is purely my own thoughts and opinions, so I know there will be people that agree with me and certainly others that do not. If you are one of the people who purchased this game and felt that you had spent your money well, then excellent, I'm glad that you enjoyed the experience more than I did."

,Recommended,221910,7864286,"Posted: 1 December, 2013",all,Vic,"Any individual with even the slightest or most remote interest in video gaming as a medium of artistic expression must categorically play The Stanley Parable within their lifetime. It's, ostensibly, a re-release of the 2011 Half-Life 2 mod of the same name, and is still built on the Source engine and is, more or less, largely the same game but having been thoroughly redesigned in certain key ways, especially its themes and parts of its narrative structure.The Stanley Parable (developed by a small indie studio named Galactic Cafe) is, essentially, as its demo states, ""a game of endings"". It's a game that poses some very important questions about the way games currently work - it's a parable (a story which illustrates a lesson), or rather a collection of parables each hidden within another. Each new playthrough represents a new part of the experience, revealing yet another of the game's many endings, each with a different existential or absurdist lesson that build into the game's broader thesis.It's also a game of choice, in that it proposes that ludic notions of ""choice"" and ""free will"" are inherently absurd in all games, since they don't actually represent any kind of meaningful or significant choice: they're just slightly different parts of the same overall plan that the game designer has laid out before you, and thus subordinate to his own intentions and choices; and therefore, inconsequential. You're still only just walking that path - in fact, all you ever do in the Stanley Parable is walk; literally. And when you do press the use button (which is for ludic purposes the mouse button, but in the original mod, was the 'E' button), you hear the unmistakable sound of a key being pressed. And as the intro and several endings exemplify, that is the nature of Stanley's job and ultimately, the nature of his existence and of our experience within the game: pressing buttons, both in-game and out of game.It also has a lot to say about endings, and the way choices feed into those endings. By presenting us with a closed environment with very minimal and sparse mechanics, The Stanley Parable is able to present us with an environment so sparse and so limited that the ""choices"" we are offered seem that much more significant and that much more abundant; and the same goes for its endings. But as much as the choices themselves mean nothing, they also lead the player into the aforementioned endings. No ending has finality, and no ending presents a perfect victory for Stanley or the player. In fact, in almost all the endings the respective thematic conflict between Stanley and the Narrator remains entirely open, but no ending feeds into another in any capacity, underlining the lack of meaning the notion of multiple endings in games can offer. Games teach the player that anything but a perfect win-state is a failure, and that further playthroughs can objectively improve the conclusion of the story, be it through moral superiority or mechanical perfection. The Stanley Parable, in comparison, gives us subjective endings which can be interpreted freely which all invariably lead into a restart of the game. As the game itself states: ""the end is never the end is never the end is never the end is never LOADING"".In the process, certain themes and concepts will be left underdeveloped; but isn't this the point of the game? Asking questions that only subsequent explorations of the game by way of critical commentary or subsequent works in the same vein (perhaps by Galactic Cafe, or other designers) will be able to answer? Leaving its own ideas open to interpretation and exploration? I certainly think so. And so, it's definitely worth experiencing for yourself. Set your prejudices regarding ""walking simulators"" or ""ungames"" aside and walk into The Stanley Parable without any expectations but those the game designer creates for himself and for his own vision."

,Recommended,221910,29107007,Posted: 7 January,all,Olde,"Combining existentialism and humour, confusion and wit, surrealism and stark confrontations with an isolated reality, The Stanley Parable serves as one of the most self-aware video games in recent memory. It is definitely a contender for one of the most intertextual video games ever made in its self-referentiality and in the developers' awareness of all the standard tropes that become subverted or distorted. The Stanley Parable is basically played one of two ways: straight through following the proper story or deviating from the normal path, and there are very specific points where you are given a clear choice between the two. However, once you branch from the correct path, you'll find that even if you try to go back to it, it becomes impossible. This game touches briefly on some notions such as narrative and individual autonomy, but unfortunately never does anything more than make you contemplate them briefly. The way it comes together seems to differ each time as it has a number of different endings, and beginning again will offer you yet more choices. However, as self-aware a game though it is, it is rather short as its intertextual premise simply can't sustain itself for very long. The player reaches an ending of one form or another, and then restarts to explore another path, seemingly arbitrarily.On to the technical aspects. The voice acting for this game is superb, and although there's a lot to listen to, it never comes across as boring. The developers could not have cast better voice actors for this game, and it's clear that in the hands of lesser talents, this game would be nothing.  Theymakethis game. Visually, it's the Source engine, so it predictably looks good, but nothing fantastic. The overall polish is very good and it ends up finding a nice middleground that looks modern but not too sleek. I didn't have any problems running it. There really aren't too many complaints on the technical side of things.Now, I do have some criticisms for the game. Although it is very good and the concept, design, and voice work are top-notch, there are still a couple of things that I would say are problems. For instance, I don't think there's more than two hours worth of content here. You can beat the main story in less than five minutes (in fact, for one of the achievements, you're encouraged to), and there's only so long you can run around. On top of that, this is still a Source mod, and although it has a large file size, it reuses a lot of assets from other Source games. Lastly, for the few third person scenes that there are, they look quite bad. There's nothing that just screams lazy like a static image with a slow camera pan out. A lot of the reviews I've read highly praise the game, but I don't think it's really THAT worthy a game for all the praise it's received. The developers deftly subvert the average player's expectations and have created a uniquely cerebral game with some creative design choices, but it doesn't hold a lot of replay value or weight. It incorporates humor and is funny in places, but it doesn't feel like there's a whole lot there. Although there are a ton of different legitimate paths you can take, there isn't any actual puzzle-solving or anything that will make you think. It's well-made but it really does feel like a Source mod and it ultimately just ends up being a short game.It also drops pretty much all tropes from FPP (first-person perspective) video games, in that there's no combat or intricate maneuvering to be had. I applaud this since it distinctly breaks the mold from most FPP games, but it doesn't fill the hole with much else than wandering around barren corridors. Most games either focus on combat, puzzle-solving, platforming, immersing the player in a compelling and interesting world, or if nothing else, appreciating the scenic view, if not a mix of all five. Removing combat, puzzles, platforming (you can't jump at all and never need to crouch), starting the player with a nonsensical premise and boring environment, and keeping interactivity surprisingly low, The Stanley Parable in fact doesn't haveany of the above. Rather, the game opts for what are in actual fact simply minor decisions (such as taking a right path instead of a left path), but constantly reminding the player that this decision is incredibly important. Whether or not this subversion of authority and declaration of autonomy is really as significant as all that is up to the player's interpretation, but it leads to my next point.****MINOR SPOILERS AHEAD****Mild spoiler warning from here until further indicated. It ultimately turns out that actually the entire point of the game isthe player's decisionto either follow or disregard the game's storyline. By expressing his own volition, he can choose whether or not to either submit to or betray the narrative. That's it. Now, I'm fine with that, but it doesn't really go anywhere with this. Furthermore, as a game, it doesn't do much, if anything, with its medium. For instance, The Stanley Parable could be rendered in first-person perspective in the Source engine, or it could just as easily be rendered in the medium of an eight-bit pixelated platformer. Or it could even be text-based. The reason is becauseit's the concept behind the game that is on display here, not the stuff of the game itself(i.e., the engine). The Stanley Parable depicts its environments accurately but likewise, there is little reason for it to take place in the environment it does. It looks like an office, and it feels like an office, but it could just as well take place pretty much anywhere else. The game opens up conveniently after everyone has suddenly disappeared, and although while playing the game the player doesn't really question this much, afterwards it made my brain itch, and I just got the sense that this was done so the developers didn't have to animate models, write scripted dialogue, or find more voice actors. Basically all this is to say that the same concept could be done any number of ways, so much so that the storyline that the game (read: Narrator) is trying to tell is rendered completely meaningless. Lastly, the decisions that you do make are possibly only there for comedic value. Nothing really has any reason to be there, which may be the developer's own ironic take on narrative structure. As it stands, there is at least one point where it becomes literally impossible to save yourself from a bad ending in what feels like should be an ultimate confrontation, which is a major disappointment. One can argue that that was the point, to subvert your expectations and force a ""Game Over"" during what feels like what should be a boss battle or confrontation, but instead it feels more like an unsatisfying psychological experiment that gives a major case of blue balls. It's as though the developers don't realize that these tropes exist and get perpetuated because they're actually emotionally satisfying to actual living people, the kinds of people who bought this game.****END OF SPOILERS****This is a game that is fun to play through at the time but can get frustrating when thinking about it afterwards. That being said, I think you should use your discretion when considering buying this game. I certainly don't think it's worth the $15 pricetag at all. As it's also very heavy, even ham-fisted, in its trope subversion, if that's not your cup of tea already, this isn't going to win any converts. My opinion is, if you're interested in a short, light-hearted, trope-subverting Source mod, get it when it comes on sale. However, this seems like one of those cases where the public is so infatuated with a game that so overtly indulges itself with tropes that it feels like it's one step away from being meme-defining. I'll take a cue from The Stanley Parable and say that it's really your choice whether or not you think such a game will be worth your money."

In a nutshell, this ‘game’ is essentially an attempt by you, Stanley, to discover what has happened to your co-workers and bosses, all of whom have completely disappeared.That’s the game in its entirety on a superficial level without giving away any spoilers. The underlying message is regarding the choice, or the illusion of choice, that modern video games allude to offer. The developers seem to be responding to games such as Mass Effect, that suggest they offer the gamer real choice in the outcome of the narrative yet in reality the gamer only has a couple of options dressed up in different clothing. There is a clear critique here regarding the nature of ‘choice’ in the video game industry and while it is welcomed change for video games to include a metaphorical message (beyond the simplistic), these messages and critiques should not exist in a vacuum, devoid of any gameplay. The point being that, there is a thought provoking message here, but this is not a game.Stripped down, the Stanley Parable is a game of ‘walk and listen’. Yes there are some interesting points mentioned by the narrator relating to conscious decision making, but this same message could have been offered through or alongside gameplay features that stretched beyond walking around a corridor. Quite simply, this is a lecture, a chore of a lecture that unfortunately lasts for 2-3 hours before you realise you could have just read the same underlying message in a free online article in about 10 minutes without being subjected to this gaming con artistry.Clearly there is a sense that the Stanley Parable is offering some ‘high art’ by not including actual gameplay, or that this ‘genius indie title’ will have your head scratching. There is a suggestion that if you ‘don’t get’ intelligent games that you won’t appreciate the Stanley Parable, that you can’t grasp its deeper message. Well, that is quite frankly a gross lie and yet a master stroke in marketing. People are desperately scrabbling to offer rave reviews of this new form of game, eager to show they are not cut from the COD cloth of gaming, that they can enjoy this intellectual critique. Do not be fooled. This is a totally unsatisfactory experience especially considering the price charged.Do you want a thought provoking experience about the intricacies of the mind and the illusion of choice? Read a book. This is just pseudo-philosophical gaming at its very worst, conning the masses into feeling like an intellectual giant for a couple hours at the small price of being tricked by the illusion of gameplay. Who’s more of a sucker in this scenario, Stanley? Or us?'The game will end, the game will never end'. Sold to us as an interesting game of uncertainty. Well, there is at least one certainty about the Stanley Parable; you will never see the cash you spent again.As always comments are welcomed and I will try to get back to you as soon as possible."

However, that's all I really found enjoyable. It's not that I didn't like everything else, it's just there didn't seem to be much else to do.You get different endings depending on your choices, but after playing it over and over for a while I already got most of the obvious (as in ""easy to obtain"") endings and was just running in to them again and again multiple times. I know there's more complex things you can do to get different endings, which I don't mind, but it made me think I could've just easily looked them up on YouTube instead of spending $15. I was playing a game with no real challenge to prevent me from getting to those endings.I understand that it's supposed to be more an experience then just a game, but I personally didn't find it that philosophical with it's message and would've been better off getting an actual game on Steam. I'd have probably enjoyed this more if it was either for free or at a lower price. I don't think it's worth $15, you'd be better off spending that money on Shovel Knight."

You play as a regular office worker called Stanley, and a narrator tells you where to go and what to do. If you follow what the narrator says, you go through a very cliche story that, to be honest, isn't amazing. What makes the game great is when you defy the narrator's instructions. Where this would break a normal game, The Stanley Parable adapts to your choices and the paths you take, Personally, I wouldn't buy this game at full price, as I think there's only a few hours of gameplay and for £10 that's not great. I picked it up in a sale for £2.50, and I don't regret it. A good buy if you're looking for something a bit different."

The demo is entirely original  content, and is easily as good as the main game.About the game:With only about 3 hours worth of content and minimal replay value, it's hard to justify the purchase price. Pick it up if it goes on sale, though...Since the store page isn't very helpful, here's what the game is about. It's an exploration game in the same vein as Dear Esther or 30 Flights of Loving. You wander around looking at things and the environment is only minimally interactive. An extremely clever and witty narrator tells your story as you wander through the environment.Gameplay uses FPS controls and there are few cutscenes to interrupt the immersion, but you will often find yourself trapped in a small area waiting for something. This is less annoying in The Stanley Parable than it is in other games since listening to the narration is basically the whole point of the game.The plot moves along a lot like a choose-your-own-adventure. You'll be repeatedly sent back to the beginning of the game and need to repeat one of a few choices that select which ending you get. There aren't a lot of choices to make and only about 10 endings, but there are some random elements to the game and some of the endings have an effect on your next restart, so there is enough variety to keep the beginning of the game interesting even though you'll see it many times.The plot is extremely witty, clever, and well narrated.

He enjoys playing just about everything, from shooting lots of things, to solving puzzles, to driving fast cars. Years ago he stumbled upon a Half Life 2 mod called ""The Stanley Parable"" which he looked at the screenshots with much attention. The page did not give much info out on what the game really was. Confused on how everyone that played it, said he should play it immediately! Thinking nothing of it, Stanley continued on and did not play the mod.Few years later, Stanley logs onto Steam and heads to the front page of the Store. The first thing he sees is a giant banner that says ""The Stanley Parable Now Available!"" Stanley was confused on how such a thing was on Steam, which it was only a Mod. So Stanley checked out the store page. He first checked out the videos and screenshots. He was still confused on what the game actually was. He noticed that there was a demo available, so Stanley downloaded the demo, to give the game a shot. After all, he was tired of playing games with the younger kids screaming into their mics saying that they ""Did his mom last night"" and other inappropriate  comments.An hour later, Stanley finished the demo. He was so confused on what he had experienced, and oddly very happy about it as well. Without hesitation, Stanley purchased the game and started playing ""The Stanley Parable.""The game made Stanley question so many things in his life.What is this game?Do I really have a choice?How does this game know?Who is this Narrator?Why is his voice so amazing?Why is this game so funny?Why have I spent over 20 hours playing it?What is Life?What is Love?Why are you still reading this?Stanley could not really answer this, for he could not think of the right words to say. The experiences he had while playing this game was nothing he had experienced before. Knowing why everyone else kept telling him to play it, he now understands. Trying to tell other people to play it? Well... That is where YOUR choice begins...Pros:- If you played the game already, you probably read the entire review in the Narrator's voice.- Extremely cleverly made. (Unlike this review.)- Hilarious most of the time.- By far the best Walking Simulator ever created (and I hate most games like that.)- Kevan Brighting's voice is godly.- Multiple ""Endings""- Adventure Line.- 8888888888888888888888888888888- You push buttons.- The choice is a lie.- The Broom Closet.Cons:- Might be a bit pricey for some people.- It IS a walking simulator, some people may not like those games at all.- Not so simple achievements (to do legit.)- There is 1 ending that requires 4 hours to get.- You can experience most of the game in 6 hours, unless you really look around and pay attention to the little details.Seriously though, give the Demo a try. The Demo is it's own experiance that does not spoil ANYTHING about the main game. If you enjoyed that then buy the game.Stanley enjoyed this review so much, he gave it a thumbs up!"

That Game You've Heard Of.Genre: 1st Person Self Exploration.Developed & Published by: Galactic CafePlatform: Windows, Mac and LinuxBusiness Model: Base GameCopy Purchased by MyselfOverall Gameplay ThoughtsIs Stanley Parable a game? Are you a real person? Ok, you've probably gotten sick of hearing this joke when it comes to reviews about the Stanley Parable, so I'll knock it off. But cmon, I had to have a little fun.Yea, that joke was old even when I originally posted this review. So, time to put a bit of strikethrough it and put some actual effort into talking about the game itself. You play as Stanley, an office worker that wants something more out of life. Or maybe he doesn't. The game mechanics are simple: you walk through doors, hallways and rooms while listening to an excellent British accent describing what you are or aren't doing. Or going on a rambling about some unrelated happening. Or maybe its incredibly related and you don't realize it. Sometimes you'll push buttons, open doors or fall to your death. But really, those actions that you perform aren't what matter most. It's what you take away from the experience that matters. You'll be replaying the levels over and over again as different actions can cause different little ""stories"" to play themselves out. It's a pretty passive experience though as you can't really do anything other than choose minor actions at certain times.This could have easily been a game stuck up on itself but it's clear that the developers want us to consider what it is to live this life and to play videogames. How we interact and deal with videogames on a regular basis. There's quite a bit more under the surface than even I gave it credit for after I finished playing it and watched some other people talk about it.PC SettingsThe game comes with more PC settings than you could possibly ever want or need for a game like TSP. Resolutions, FoV slider, AA/Shader/Effect/Texture detail controls and much more. Everything is here, even support for high framerates. The game is very stable from all that I can tell and have heard. There is nothing missing that I can think you would need.Final ThoughtsThis is a title where I don't think it matters what I think. I think it's a title you need to explore for yourself and take away from it what you will. It is essentially a walking simulator, I won't deny that. And the player interactivity is minimal at best. But, I think its worth checking out. Take the time to appreciate what's being said and shown to you.Read this review and more on A Paladin Without A Crusade."

What is obscene is what is hidden.” -Nagisa Oshima***Before beginning, I would like to give a special thanks to my fiancé for proofing this review for me, as well as to wish her an early Happy Anniversary. Thank you for giving me the five most wonderful years of my life.What some consider to be an Indie gem while others plea confusion as to the course of this title,The Stanley Parableis a game about choice and consequence, with moderately brief journeys being the focus of play. The player takes control of Stanley, an office worker whose position entails the pressing of buttons throughout the day; the operation of these simple devices is his sole function, until one bizarre day, all of his coworkers vanish. From here Stanley leaves his office unprompted in search of some answers. I will do my best to refrain from writing this review in the identical joking tone of most writings, though the comedy in this title is infectious.Here are just a few reasons to give this memorably fantastic game a try:Atmosphere - This title progresses through Stanley’s well-crafted office space as the player maneuvers through the expected rooms and hallways that you would foresee composing a business department. I do not wish to spoil much aboutthe broom closet, cargo lift, mind control facility, orother sections ofThe Stanley Parable’sbranching story for the sake of having you experience them for yourself.Gameplay - As stated in the introduction, players assume the role of Stanley from a first person perspective as he explores his abandoned office spaces, through multiple unique rooms and themes in order to discover the ‘finale’ for the tale. The controls are simple, with the W, A, S, and D keys acting as movement commands; the Control key assuming the crouched position; and the LMB allowing the player to interact with various objects within the environment. There are both hidden and pronounced articles within the environment that can be toggled to alter story paths-covered in the coming section.Writing - As unambiguous as this game appears to be, this story-rich satire is far from any other market experience.The Stanley Parableperforms as expected, with the players unraveling new beginnings and ends while probing for secluded secrets. Between these points of interest, the brilliant Kevan Brighting voices each interaction-or lack there-of-to entail a sense of accomplishment for the player, in the stead of simply stalling in a daft room until prompted otherwise. This commentary is extremely witty, and displays each critical action Stanley makes. In a sense, this is more of a powerful placebo to gaming: it takes the form of what you expect any game would yet lacks just the right amount of properties, toning it a simulation.TL:DR - As with the quote above,The Stanley Parableis an obscure game which presents the perfect amount of subtly in its processes. There can never be a proper review forThe Stanley Parabledue to how absurdly miraculous it is, yet every review written about it is the perfect review since it is that of individuality, such as with this title; the only true way to understand this title is to simply play it for yourself. As much as I would love to write on and on about this title, no words can do it justice, as it is difficult to pinpoint every exceptional portion of this work. I highly recommend this title to those who enjoy titles depicting choice and consequence, as well as narratives. Thanks for reading.Do you enjoy these reviews?

Very few have a playtime longer than 3-4 hours, because that's really all you can stretch out of it.     One of the achievements requires running the game up to 24 hours in a single setting (although you can trick the game by editing your BIOS)  My own review would only show about 2 hours of actual gameplay. The rest, was idling for the achievement. Almost every review that shows a play time over 24 hours is misleading if you think they actually got that much time and attention out of it. You can literally see and pick apart everything in the game in just a few hours, especially if you are particularly clever.  I have 8 friends who currently own this, i combined all of their total play times. approx. 16 hours combined. Add in the actual 2 hours I was playing, and we're sittin at 18 hours total. Its not a tremendous value.I bought it at a 75 percent off sale, and I still feel they were asking too much.  Its just a source mod with some clever writing. I wished there was more game here, because there's nothing wrong with what you get ! The ""game"" and the experience it provides is great!  but the price, oh lord. that price.Being such a high priced game and having all the positive reviews simultaneously, i expected a lot more.If this was $3.75 or less (what i paid) I would change my review to positive.

Perhaps your life is amazing, sad, depressed, happy...whatever. The choice is yours.The gameplay is seamless. Perfect controls for the game. The graphics are also top notch. It actually looks like the Unity engine a bit, but if it was, the developer maximized what he got out of it. Some of the puzzles can be challenging, and deception factors in to some aspects of this game as well.The narration however is really where this game is at. There are only two other games that I can think of that rivals this one in that regard (Battleblock Theater, Bastion), although their styles couldnt be more different.I have seen something like 18 different endings with this game. Not sure how many there really are, but there are a lot, and so as you can expect, there is a ton of replay value with this game.The developer also had some fun with the achievements. One of them is to play all day (24 hours) on a Tuesday, lol. One is to play, and then play again a year later. Etc....This game is an easy 10/10.

The story IS interesting, but not the same way games like Final Fantasy, Pillars of Eternity, Dues Ex, the Fallout series, etc. are. The story is interesting because it narrates every choice you make, which is why I think it's better than your average ""walking simulator"" as it means that the game acknowleges your actions in a way that I haven't seen done before instead of just having you along for the ride. This leads to a lot of humor and is satisfying to the player. The game literally responds when you try to break it. That's fullfilling."

It's engaging, self-referential, shocking, and every once in a while uncomfortable to play, a story related not through one direct story but rather through a broad assortment of fanning ways that curves the dubiousness of control that PC amusements work so difficult to give us.You may know The Stanley Story from its 2011 cycle as a Half-Life 2 mod. I didn't, as it happens, yet this has a basically more mind boggling modification of that idea, no longer made of Half-Life resources and hugely connected by maker Davey Wreden as a gathering with William Pugh. The Stanley Story begins in a standard work region area in a shrewdly dull looking office, cursor sparkling on the screen of a beige screen. You are Stanley, an agreeable salaryman who spends his days respectfully creating summons in a diminish work territory extend. One day, the majority of his partners vanish, surrendering him to investigate the workplace alone in the relationship of an avuncular storyteller.This storyteller detest Dear Esther's bright, careful speaker, with his stories about dissidents and goats and verse. He prods, reprimands, gets drained or irate with you, whispers conspiratorially with you and – in particular – lets you know what to do to instigate the story as you investigate an office that is startling in its harshness, from the uniform covering to the propelling expressions on the whiteboards and non specific nature depictions, in every practical sense everything stamped with a number.My actuate sense was to disregard the voice in my cerebrum, yet regardless you try to subvert it, The Stanley Tale is set up with yet another readied condition, another lump of witty script, promptly annoying and remunerating you for endeavoring to stray from the set way – notwithstanding the way that, and this is the basic point, everything is a set course in The Stanley Story, and it reprimands the mind flight of decision. You imagine that you're controlling the result, in light of current conditions it's dependably the storyteller controlling you.I expect the purpose behind The Stanley Outline, on the off chance that you feel constrained to discover a show it, is well while in transit to see the vast majority of its differing endings and changes, which turning out from pivotal decisions – like taking the entryway on the left, or the gateway on the advantage – into trade plotlines with further augmenting occasions, fanning outwards to sporadic conclusions. The substance ""the end is never the end"" floats over the screen when you discover one of these endings, and you are come back to Stanley's work space to begin again.What's bewildering is the route by which constrained conditions and plainly restricted decisions incite such a generous number of various results. Here and there you'll settle on precisely the same and something else will happen, as the storyteller changes track. In around a hour I discovered seven fascinating endings, and when I saw another person play, they found another two that I'd never viewed.My first Stanley Account experience was a Kafkaesque bureaucratic shocking dream where each endeavor I made to sharpen my essentialness of decision drove me more noteworthy to a tenaciously inflexible, inevitable course of action of charges that I had no honest to goodness elective however to take in the wake of, winding up at ground zero in my passing. Some of its stages trap you in unlimited circles, compelled to listen to the storyteller pontificate until he condescends to give you another demand. The storyteller's aggregate control over what you can do and when you can do it now and again makes him feel like a correctional facility screen; unmistakable times he's a sidekick, an assistant, a delicate engaging associate.It's a really odd trouble for some person before long acquainted with PC diversions and their essentials. You have to break them, however the storyteller is always a couple wanders before you, lastly you're left tending to what the inspiration driving decision is at all in a framework where each change is laid out for you and some omniscient storyteller has every one of the reserves of being set up to anticipate all that you may do. The best way to The Stanley Account's engaging ""best"" conclusion is to take after the storyteller's headings and do as you're told like a not all that awful little droid, and a little while later a violently twist accomplishment appears commending you for ""beating the preoccupation"".In context of its prelude, I thought The Stanley Outline may be a festival of decision, of the power that we need to break out of our life's repressions by in a general sense acting all of a sudden, however that is precisely The Stanley Story assaults. I speculated that it was remarkably uncomfortable to play on occasion, similar to I was gotten in it – it's the nearest a distraction has ever come to duplicating that inclination being stuck in a dull dream. The title screen – a recursive photograph of a screen demonstrating similar Start screen – mirrors that unease.It's in like way especially captivating, generally because of a sharp script and the storyteller's vivacious execution, and makes visit attacks into the dreamlike and incredible. One of the endings, especially, is an amazingly illustrate joke that gets all the all the more intriguing and cleverer as it goes on, and made me giggle more than any redirection since Entryway. Where The Stanley Story's demo was a light joke of PC preoccupation traditions – unquestionably go play that, in the event that you haven't beginning now, it's a standalone thing - the full stimulation is impressively more bizarre, and less constrained especially.Infrequently The Stanley Tale feels like an examination of the particular free for all of weariness. Particular times it's something else all around: a joke at the player's cost, a distribution on decision and result, a joke, a bureaucratic horrendous dream. All its arranged plotlines and characters cover and join to make something that is intriguingly dinky, however continually dazzling, and really captivating. Whatever it can't abstain from being, it legitimizes playing.(All reviews are retrieved from the Internet and piped through a succession of synonym tools three times both for humour and to save time.

The core of the game is the way it relates and plays with the player.As the title suggests this is a story about Stanley, an employee living a monotone life and working in an office when all of a sudden he realizes the entire floor is empty. And here the player begins the game. The real core of the gme though is the Narrator's voice, the way he describes your actions and guides you. There's a canon ending where you hear Stanley's story where he finally realizes he's free and all, but that lame and simple specious ending has nothing to do with the game itself, in my opinion. In fact you simply have to blindly follow the narrator's directions to finish it in 15 mins or so. The real point of the game is in the huge amount of variations derived by all the choices you're being presented, the Narrator's reactions breaking the 4th wall both with Stanley and the player itself more than you'd expect and the way the game evolves in multiple directions and restart in different variations, resulting more in a comedy than a parable.The engine is the good old trusty Source Engine, and the office and other ambiences have been well built with a simple but effective level of detail.Unfortunately there's not much music in game but it's kind of right this way, as it would break the atmosphere of the game.+++PROs+++NARRATOR.The real core of the game is not to beat the game, nor Stanley himself or his parable, but it's the narrator. It's all about the choices you make and his reactions that can drive the story to an incredible number of variations, from tragedy, to comedy at the limit of ridiculous with the narrator breaking the 4th wall not only with Stanley but with the player as well.---CONs---UNCOMMON.The unusual structure of the game might not look appealing to the most conventional players, as they could finish the game with the canon ending in 10-15 minutes not realizing that the purpose of the game lies in testing the limits of all the choices and variables and seeing the game evolve and degenerate as the narrator hilariously comments your actions and choices... Even if you're doing nothing at all! As a ""traditional"" gamer myself I've been lucky enough because I chose to never listen the Narrator since the very beginning (I didn't trust him XD) to finish with a sad and nonsense ending that slowly brought me back at the beginning. Since then I started trying various alternatives.I played this game on this machine:Laptop Lenovo Z50Intel Core i5-4210U8Gb RAM DDR3GeForce 840MIntel HD Graphics 4400Windows 10 Home x64And on this machine:Intel Core i7-497016Gb RAM DDR3GeForce GTX 660Windows 10 Professional x64"

It trys to discuss the probabilities that derive from obedience and rebellion, and to achieve a high-level of interaction between players and the game. I cannot allege it is successful, but this attempt is praisable.Various endings is an attraction of the game. Among those endings, my favoriate one is the 'Crazy Ending', which will be achieved by walking down the stairs instead of up. The final narration is so good that it makes me feel I am Stanley, and being assisted by repetitive rooms, description of thinking and the style of stream-of-consciousness, it gives players an intense atomsphere and great immersive. Every ending is so distictive and interesting that can inspire players to try every choice over and over again. Under those circunstances, I think, it is as a metapher, instead of as a simple character, that should Stanley be defined.The narrator is the most important role in the game. It is he who continuously pushs the story forward and guides Stanley into different endings. He can be regarded as a highlight and also a drawback of the game. His words and tone contribute to game's style and atmosphere, but also undermine it's reality. If most of the narration can be replaced by text and make it focus on pushing the climax(just like what he does in the Crazy Ending), it would be more splendid.Except those advantages, this game is quite boring. Although it seems like players areexploringthe game, but they not. All they can do is just walk along the routes that pre-designed by game-makers, and repetitive narration helps me comfirm it. Simply, throughout the game what players play is to choose 'left or right?'. It does provide some interesting things, but the gameplay and replaybility are poor. But you can regarded it as a voiced novel.Another drawback is that the game is so short that players can beat it within 10 mins. Although it contains multiple endings and the plot will be changed just result from slight changes in choices——it is still too short →_→. $15 is too much, so I strongly suggest anyone who wants to try this game keep waiting for this game apparing in bundles.How to define this game? Or, more prudently，should it be defined as a game?Without a doubt it is a good experiment. Yet, compared with novels and movies of the same type, The Stanley Parable seems stillprimitive."

I suppose it’s understandable to a degree, as The Stanley Parable is undeniably witty and unconventional, with a quirky charm and dry self-awareness. It is so overwhelmingly eccentric that it can begin to feel as if not playing along with it and laughing at every joke is an act of disrespect, such is the perception The Stanley Parable cultivates within moments of leaving the main menu to venture forth into a cornucopia of contextually appropriate satire and bizarre dark humor.The Stanley Parable gives off such a sense of self-prescribed brilliance that I feel both dumbfounded and maybe even a little angry at just how much I dislike it. I get the joke and admire its delivery, but when approached from any angle but the one the game so strongly attempts to cultivate, The Stanley Parable feels like little more than a few intelligent observations on modern game design strung along by a series of amusing, yet immensely inconsistent and inscrutable scenes with no conclusions to be found.I understand that the lack of closure is part of the point. I can find a certain poetic appreciation for the circular design of the game, and as a lesson in abstract game design The Stanley Parable certainly gets marks for trying. But then it tries some more, and eventually (which is to say sometime within the first 20 minutes of play) I became rather weary of hearing the same joke play out as I raged a supposedly hilarious war with the narrator over increasingly innocuous choices.There is such an abundance of creativity to be admired within The Stanley Parable, one would think that even in worst case scenarios everyone will be able to find something to like buried in its labyrinth of compounding decisions. But by design each disconnected moment is compiled with the next, creating a sequence of random and oddly directed scenes for which the primary goal is to disorient the player as they continue bumbling through a game with no rules and a rather antagonistic sense of progression.The Stanley Parable without a doubt knows what it’s doing. The script is tight, the pacing smooth, and the overall concept worthy of praise. And yet I found myself despising every moment I spent with the game. The more I tried to peel back its layers to find the game I had seen praised to the ends of the earth and back, the more I was confronted with the same shallow and narcissistic experience that only became more meandering and unfulfilling the longer I stuck with it. I suppose it was fitting that I eventually arrived in a museum dedicated to the game itself; an internal monument to a project which clearly recognizes its own genius even as I struggle to understand the appeal.You can read more of my writing onKritiqal."

Have you played enough games that you instinctively recognize the tropes and common things that all games do, but can't quite put a finger on them?  Would you like a game that points them all out, and makes it amusing at the same time?  Good.  The Stanley Parable does that.Well, I mean, that's where it starts.  First it puts its finger right on those tropes, pointing them out, having a chuckle.  Then the whole hand.  Then it shoves its hand through the tropes and the wall behind them, shattering a hole into a Escher-like dimension of allegory and humor spiraling endlessly around a story that deliberately falls afoul of the same tropes it works so hard to identify and undermine.Then the game restarts, or maybe it doesn't restart.  Maybe you restarted it, but did you restart it because you wanted to, or because the game wanted you to?  And is this really a game anymore?To perhaps make that rambling a bit more clear, The Stanley Parable is a game about a man, which is really allegory about games, which in turn is a metaphor about life and choice and free will and about a billion other things.  There are so many layers to the story you could get lost in it all, but the beauty is that you don't have to.  You can be philisophical about what it all means, or you can simply laugh hysterically at the spot on narration describing, bemoaning, and sometimes belittling you, the story, and who knows what else.In short, The Stanley Parable is a beautiful mix of humor, philosophy, allegory, and self-aware commentary on video games, requiring almost no skill to understand and enjoy.

Literally, just like in the famous 'Bastion', you've got a narrator that describes your every step, every idea you got in your head. And that's how it goes 'till the moment you face a small divarication. Two doors, and the voice above you, the voice that you've been listening as if it was your own, tells you to pick the left one. And you may follow this order, and end the game sooner or later. You'll get your ending, and will be happy with it, I suppose. But what would have happened if you had chosen the diffirent path? That's when the game actually begins.This is not a drama movie and not a horror fiction. Actually, it is pretty funny and will make you a little bit happier, if you'd like. This is not even a 'story', just a small sandbox, which you can use to play with your narrator. Or...

Heck, I only heard about this game through word of mouth. The Stanley Parable is what happens when you take an interesting concept that you probably wouldn't dare put into a videogame, and actually make it work. The story (if you can call it that) is of a man named Stanley who works at a boring job in an office building, pushing buttons that his boss tells him to push via his monitor. One day, he notices that his boss hasn't given him a single command the entire day, and appears to have gone missing, along with his co-workers.That's where the gimmick of the game takes place. While there is a narrative telling you what to do throughout the game, you have a choice to follow it or stray from it. Depending on what decisions you make throughout the game, there are a total of 14 different endings in this game. This can range from ]turning off the power in a mind-control facility that has been controlling all of the thoughts and feelings of the workers in the building, including Stanley, to entering a homage of a small string of existing videogames. The thing I like about this game is that there isn't a morality meter. The choices you make aren't necessarily based on thoughts, but actions. Not only that, but some of the endings are based off of bugs, glitches and whatnot that were in the original mod (Try closing the door on yourself as you start the game.)The Stanley Parable is almost entirely psychological. During the time that it was still just a mod, the creator, Wreden,  thought up the game considering how most games on the market ""confine the user to its rules."" The dialogue in the game is very thought-provoking at times, and I've even seen some players and journalists state that it made them think about their own lives. The thought that a simple game like this can have so much influential power on someone like that is remarkable, and I applaud Galactic Cafe for this.The presentation is definetly not anything to turn your head at either. The visuals are vastly different in this game than anything you would see in Half-Life 2 (Go figure). When the developers said they were going to make an HD remake of this game, they weren't screwing around. No hallway nor room looks the same (unless designed intentionally), and everything looks crisp and clear. The music is a nice touch as well, perfectly fitting the locale and scenario that takes place. The voice acting is also a department I have to give major props to. Kevan Brighting does a fantastic job as the voice of the narrator, depicting emotions of happiness, despair, confusion, anger, worry, really the list goes on. He even goes through an evil persona during one of the endings.As I stated before, 14 endings is a lot for a game, but it is still quite a short game. Is there anything else that might convince you to take a second glance at the fifteen dollar price tag? Perhaps. The Stanley Parable may be a short game at its core, but there are a ton of secrets to be found within the different branching pathways. Extended dialogue, little visual easter eggs, and areas of the map you probably didn't even know existed until you did a little exploration. The developers really thought of everything when making this game. (Try typing sv_cheats 1 in the console. I dare you.)If you're one of those people who enjoys a non-linear experience in your videogames, as well as comedic and witty dialogue, then I highly reccomend The Stanley Parable for you. However, if you're still not sure about the fifteen dolar price tag, I advise trying out the demo first. It's actually a unique experience from the official game, and you might like what you see."
,Recommended,221910,8634874,"Posted: 9 January, 2014",all,EmP,"The Stanley Parable is a game about Stanley. Except it isn’t really, and it’s not categorically a game in the true sense of the word. It’s more like a parody, except sometimes it’s intentionally not comical; it’s introspective, so I suppose it’s more like an evolving interactive narrative based around first person exploration. Except you don’t really explore that much. The path you take is very linear aside from when it’s completely open. There is a narrative to follow though! Unless you choose to ignore it. Wait, wait, let’s start again.The Stanley Parable is certainly first person based, and is sometimes seen through the eyes of Stanley, a man working a dull office job in some corner office somewhere who arrives at work one day to find his workplace completely removed of his colleagues. Sometimes, this is a story about his search for his missing workmates and the dangerous secrets behind their disappearance. Only sometimes it’s not. It’s sometimes something completely different. It’s dependent on you. Sometimes. I can’t stop saying sometimes. Let’s start again. Again.The Stanley Parable is a direct attack on the genre tropes that first person exploration and linear gameplay presents. Upon discovering the empty interior of his office block, Stanley can move through the building, following the subtle prompts of the narrator, except that he’s free to ignore this and just wander off on his own. The narrator might scramble to tie Stanley’s erratic actions into his narrative, or he might attack you, the player, for your lack of discipline. Or he might do something else. For instance, should you stop to try to gain achievements, he may lead you on a merry dance for his own amusement. Perhaps it’s sufficient to say that the real driving force is the narrator and his reactions. Maybe it’s all about all the eventual and multiple outcomes your behaviour might garner. Except, no, that’s not quite right either.The Stanley Parable is ultimately undefinable, aside from the many aspects of the game that are easy to define. That’s just gibberish, isn’t it? Disregard that. Except, hang on, that’s kind of right. Indeed, the game can be as simple as you let it; do as you’re told, and it’s a fairly linear tale about discovery and freedom. Is that the tale it wants to tell? Maybe? Probably? No, actually, I don’t think it is. Most of the time, you can find conclusion in about 10-15 minutes, and multiple replays are needed to see the outcome of various choices you’re sometimes free to make. The game itself changes along with this; various pathways are boarded up if you abuse them too often; numerous restarts are chastised and long winded exposition mercilessly cut short with exacerbated sighs should the narrator be forced to re-tread old ground too often. It doesn’t so much as drive you towards one big true path as challenge you to pervert its most basic outcome as much as you can. Is that a mission statement? Enjoy messing up your tale? I think so.

There are a number of different endings, all of which are interesting in their own way.

The way it messes with your head I could compare to some of the experiences I had on ayahuasca... how it first tries to confuse you so that you begin to get your narrow rational mind out of the way and open yourself to the big questions. The fact that this 'game' (it's definitely a game if you consider life one, too) has no real end further supports that training character, not unlike the Dao De Jing that you can keep reading again and again and gain new insights every time. While a desire for 'completing' it might eventually get the best of you and make you consult guides, you're definitely not meant to know all there is in this game.

What really enriches the story is the omnipresent, amusing narrator (voiced by Kevan Brighting) who eventually contributes to the story much more than simply narrating it.This story branches out to multiple, very different endings depending on what the player chooses to do. The brilliance of the game is how these choices change much more than just the plot, because the game does not proceed with conventional video game logic, sometimes even criticizing it. For example, the narrator's personality changes according to how you play and sometimes he breaks the fourth wall to comment on your decisions as the player. The achievement system and how ""glitches"" are handled are other examples of this. The game is also sprinkled with secrets and easter eggs for the more curious players to search for.I find The Stanley Parable to be a thought-provoking and insightful on matters like the power of choices, the illusion of free choice, and what a video game really is or could be.Despite its brilliance The Stanley Parable is a short experience, although it is still likely to stick around in your mind for a long time, even after you found all of the endings."

However, there are multiple points where you can choose to follow the narrator or not. When choosing to follow the narrator, it is possible to complete the game in a little over four minutes, but the fun is in exploring all of the various paths and seeing the various endings to the game.

The Stanley Parable was originally developed as a Source engine mod back in 2010. Its creator Davey Wreden said that he set out to discover something about video games that hadn't been explored yet. More specifically, what would happen if you could disobey their rules.The game tells the story of Stanley, an average man who finds solace in his simple mundane office job. However on one particular day it appears that all his co-workers have suddenly disappeared. Guided by the narrator, Stanley must step out of the safety of his little cubical and begin his adventure to find out what exactly is going on.At first glance it might seem easy to categorise this as another artsy ""walk 'em up"" in the vein of something like Dear Esther or Proteus. It has a simple setting, lots of long-winded narration, not much to interact with and of course no jump or weapons, so what exactly do you do in The Stanley Parable? Well, essentially you make decisions. This is because the driving force behind the game is that of ""choice"". You decide HOW you play the game, and the game responds accordingly. And these decisions may appear simple, left or right? Over there? Over here? Touch that?Meanwhile you're guided by the soothing sound of 'the narrator' voiced brilliantly by British voice actor Kevan Brighting! The narrator attempts to lead you to successfully complete the game by advising you which path to take as well as narrating the inner monologue of the troubled protagonist Stanley. And it's through this narration that the game achieves a level of hysterical self awareness and brilliant charm very similar to the Portal series. This dynamic narration will react to the decisions you make, often breaking the fourth wall to talk to you directly. And should you decide not to listen to these directions and ""disobey"" the resulting dialogue and consequences can easily spiral out of control into the strange and surreal.But to say anymore would no doubt ruin your experience of The Stanley Parable as no two play throughs are really the same. And multiple play throughs are inevitable in a game that encourages you to poke and prod at its structure, almost everyone I know who've played this walked away from this game with a different story to tell.Depending on how your experience plays out, at some stage or another you will no doubt be forced to return to Stanley's office to once again set out to look for your co-workers, and it's here that you might decide to stop playing the game and that's totally fine, but in my experience, once you've been presented with so many variables, it's very hard to resist that urge to go back and try out every possible deviation, especially when they can alter the game so radically beyond your expectations.And this kind of thinking is just so refreshing, I found myself laughing with confusion and disbelief because every time I pushed the game, it would push back. I guess the only disappointing moment was when I came to the stark realisation that the game couldn't possibly live up to the illusion of infinite choice. However this was more bitter sweet, as I soon came to the realisation that any game that gave me this feeling of absolute freedom, if only for the briefest moment in time, was truly remarkable.The Stanley Parable might not be for everyone, but in my opinion it should be played by everyone. It's a hilarious experiment in psychology and non-linear game design that will probably teach you more about yourself as a gamer than you might want to know."

It tells some fantastic jokes, makes some self-indulgent commentary, but then it proceeds to get stranger and more intimate and less pointed and more interesting the more you poke at it. It isn't making fun of games for the sake of some self-appointed enlightened savior of gaming and it doesn't seem to be strange for the sake of strangeness.What makes Stanley Parable feel so fresh isn't the humor or the satire or the criticsm that's baked into it--those are enjyoable, but they weren't what impressed me. What makes it feel fresh is how intimately it converses with the player. I'm reminded very much of a game called Save the Date--though that was a smaller and simpler affair. Both games start with meta commentary and then submerge from there, talking carefully with you about how the narrator, creator or other characters think, feel and the ramifications of that for your behavior and your experience of the product. The secret of both of these games which drape themselves in the trappings of meta-narrative is that they do actually contain characters who you will learn about, be asked to empathize with, be asked to listen to, and be asked, after it all, to act on your conclusions should you have reached any.They are games that start with the nature of games, then the nature of reality, and then quietly, timidly, reveal that at their heart they are about the same intimacies and relationships as most intersting or moving stories. For all of the delightful jokes, strangeness, non-linearity and surreality of The Stanley Parable my most clear feeling when I stopped playing was one of loss; I had run out of ways to communicate with this person with whom I formed a relationship. I had run out of things to say and ways to prove I was listening.I was alone."

The Stanley Parable has what most games lack: choice: you can either follow the Narrator, or you can go against him to start a whole web of interesting events. When you do make these choices you get a great amount of odd happenings. Sometimes the most random things will happen that will make you fall out of your chair laughing, or things that will completely blow your mind and make you re-think life.

It just matters on what choice YOU make.Just make sure you don’t set off a nuke on accident.Personal Gaming Score:9/10I recommend this game for those who want an interesting game to play, but not to those who want action, multiplayer games, or those who just don’t really want to “think”.Can your mind handle this game? If you think you can, or cannot but decide to get the game anyway, remember this little thing I learned:THE END IS NEVER THE END IS NEVER THE END IS NEVER THE END IS NEVER THE END IS NEVER THE END IS NEVER THE END…"

Whether the ""candy"" is a brilliant easter egg, a well-constructed story element or whatever, it's great. Every path you take has a durastic affect on the outcome, each has it's own funny take on the path you've chosen. You have the choice to obey or disobey the narrator, who takes notice of you disobey him. But as I said at the beginning, this game is a bag of candy that seems almost endless. I got all the endings in 2 and  a half hours, and while it was a grand time, it was over quickly. The bag of candy had ran out. I knew every thing that was going to happen, nothing to suprise me after all the endings were found. Sure, going back to the endings would still be funny, but they wouldn't have the same puch they did on your first playthrough of them. You feel let down because this wonderful bag of candy which had the ""Rich neighborhood on Halloween candy"" now have ""From the depths of grandma's purse which makes you say,""How long has that been in there?""candy"".

Throughout the game, the narrator implicitly mocks the linear structure of gaming design, achievements, winning conditions, and choices. Recently we have open world/roguelike/sandbox games but still the majority of the most popular titles are quest-driven and poorly/linearly designed.The Stanley Parable subverts stereotypical elements of video games. For example;-There is no winning condition in TSP so it is impossible to beat the game. There is no legitimate ending and beginning. Storyline is twisty and unpredictable. TSP makes you question why we are so preoccupied with the idea of winning and completing quests.- Do choices really matter in games? No matter what you choose, you always operate within the confines of the game structure. Escaping from the reality in real world, you are confined in a fictional digital world. And like real life, true choices are just an illusion.- Why there is no midway between dying and following the narrator or NPCs. Witnessing the terror and panic of the narrator, when you do not follow his orders, you realize that it is really fun to step out ot the script and the linear boundaries of the game.TSP is really clever and accurate in presenting the philosophical questions and criticism on the current status quo of the gaming industry, deconstructing the linear structure of game titles and leading gamers to interpret how they interact with game mechanics and narration in their pseudo-characters in the digital world."

The VO is soothing, witty, full of emotion; it's also surprisingly complete, with many dialogues going on much longer than one would expect. The game is all about the joy of discovery, and the narration encapsulates this perfectly, as you can't wait to hear what he says next.Because of the nature of The Stanley Parable, it does get repetitive after a while.

It manages to give us a message and thoughts to think about related to games while not taking itself seriously. I was smiling throughout the entire game while still thinking about the game and the message it's trying to get across.The best way to experience Stanley Parable is simply not reading about it, going into it blindly. That can be a big risk for many people. That's why there is an excellent demo which shows us what you could except while not showing anything from the actual game.Narration from Kevan Brighting is perfect, if it was any different narrator the experience simply wouldn't be the same.It's hard to write about Stanley Parable, it truly is.

Each choice has their own consequences, and thus offers the player quite an amount of replayability.Also, going the wrong way has never felt so right in games other than this.The narrator is awesome as well. Makes you randomly giggle in the room sometimes and makes people think ""what the hell this guy even is laughing at"". I rate this game EIGHT. *presses 8 button*ALSO, BROOM CLOSETS!!

I know you spent some hard-earned-cash on this thing you call a piece of art, but you know what? Games are bloody ridiculous! You're sitting here in front of your PC screen while pressing random buttons just because the game tells you to. You're wasting your precious time! OK, I know that you will never be a rocket scientist or find the cure for cancer, but instead of video games, you should go out and enjoy the beauty of the world we live in.How do I know that?Well, for me it's obvious. When you follow all of the narrator's commands , you'll reach an ending where Stanley (and you at the same) shut off the so-called 'mind-control-facility' and then leave it through a garage door leading straight into a bright, greenish landscape. Shortly thereafter you lose control over Stanley who continues walking by himself and then the screen fades to black while you get an achievement that you beat the game.But the confusing thing about The Stanley Parable is that it also offers you other endings which deal with totally different stuff.After all, it is a game about choice and consequence. Wherever you go changes the ending of the game. While it may be a game which had less budget than an AAA-title, it is by far more complex concerning the story.The Stanley Parable is worth both your time and your cash. Buy it and let yourself be entertained by this innovative piece of art.And then don't play it for five years and be rewarded for doing so the day you decide that you want to be Stanley again."

You just can't stop, you must play with stanley, fight with him, struggle with him, and find each other on a deeper level.

(Except for one...It is about four hours to reach it and I admittedly just didn't have the patience!! lol)  Each twist and turn gives you random comments from the narrator and I reveled in each new discovery.  The storyline is simplistic, but well written.  You play as the character, Stanley, who is the only character in the game.  (Unless you include the narrator, which I suppose he COULD be considered one as well.)  Your goal is to try and leave this empty, and evidently abandoned, office building.  It seems as if all your co-workers have disappeared and you are aiming to find some answers while making your way through the the hallways and depths of this forboding menace of what feels like the walls closing in of a silent prison, in a metaphorical sense that is.  I found this such an enjoyable and clever little game I wouldn't mind someday going back and playing it again, even just for the comedic interactions of the narrator.

( I hope no one gets man, since the whole point of the game is to get people to think and ask questions). As a whole, I don't honestly think so.

Its narrator and script are top notch though and really carry the game ensuring that its tone and mood are always spot on.

After playing all endings except the ""Art Ending,"" I look at the big picture and it seems to me that the game is saying something along the lines of ""Follow all of 'The Narrator's' commands or else something bad will surely happen to you."" ""The Narrator"" being interchangeable with ""The Man"" or God or any authority figure. Even the ""Heaven Ending"" is twisted, albeit humorously, to be unappealing to the player.At a more surface level The Stanley Parable is parodying modern life, particularly work life, as well as video games themselves. It is here that the game shines and earns the praise it's received. I appreciate the jabs it takes at the mindless routines that consume much of our lives. Getting us to see our faults while simultaneously making us laugh is this game's greatest strength. However, as I stated in the previous paragraph, what happens within the game when you try to break out of the preset path seems to discourage the very same type of action that the game's satire encourages. This makes for a muddled message that makes me question the clarity and depth of the game. Perhaps I'm focusing too much on the real life issues when they meant it to be foremost a critique of modern game design where you often can't deviate substantially from the narrow narrative path.Excellent voice acting and witty comedy make the first few hours with the game very enjoyable. The way the game is designed to be replayed many times to explore different choices ultimately catches up with it as the repetition grows stale. To be fair, they did a lot to mitigate this by speeding up certain sections or by changing up what the Narrator says in successive playthroughs. It took me 5 hours to complete nearly everything the game has to offer (excluding 1 ending that requires 4 hours of ridiculous tedium). That time includes a significant amount of repetition and a short time on the web checking for any endings or achievements I had missed. Being that short I can't call this a good value for your gaming dollar.6/10 and a weak ""thumbs up."""

,Recommended,221910,7773271,"Posted: 26 November, 2013",all,Limie Pie,"It's pretty hard to tell what's this game about. Let me try not to spoil it for you... Well...This is a game about the honorable knight of a modern century. Stanley uses his power of thought to fight against the realms of forgotten human fears. The fears all of us have. Almost all of us. Stanley isn't afraid of our mere troubles, they're way too small for his thoughtful brain. He is a hero.Oh, the game, right. It takes place in space, where Stanley fights against demons disguised as giant stars. They will try  to seduce him, but we all know that this is impossible. Stanley cannot be controlled. He's the one controlling. He saves people and planets just on his own. Entire universe is fighting against him, but he will manage to strike back. He's a hero after all.But Stanley isn't one of the shining armor knights riding a white horse. He's close to our human beings. He has feelings. He sleeps, he laughs, he coughs, he frightens, he washes floors for free being a nice generous guy. See? He's just like you and me. He will never  give up trying to prove to this world being a perfect person who deserves this title.Levels? Who need them? The game runs perfectly well using two maps with giant attention to detail. Every piece of paper has it's own unique messages about Stanley being awesome. Every single chair has a bubblegum attached underneath. Even more: each gum has it's own flavor! Real revolution in game design will let you feel to be there, with Stanley.The story adjusts to your game style! It may be either fast-paced or slow walk on a park. Or maybe you will run across that park with bunch of sharks on your tail. Stanley doesn't have a tail like most of us. Another similarity! You're pretty much alike with Stanley! Except he does what he wants.But this game is not about what Stanley wants. This game is about what you want. You want to get another game where you play as a wizard,  because you want to be one, but simply can't. You want a game where you play as someone better than you. A game, where you can escape your daily routine and dive into a thriling adventure you will never get in your boring life. Stanley doesn't need neither you nor me nor anyone else. His story is perfect and complete.But you want to see it in action. Let all those puppets dance just for you. You were not even paying attention to what I was saying. It's a human nature to be maximally boring and minimally paying any attention to the matter of facts. I bet you can't wait to finish reading this very review to post a comment about both grammatical mistakes I've made, or maybe even about double spaces. Why are you reading this then? Most of you has already played the game and read this just to find some person to mock up because of his writing or spelling skills. Because none of you make mistakes. You're all perfect. Like Stanley is."

76561198040616154,Recommended,221910,8737073,"Posted: 16 January, 2014",all,Stermayer,"One of the best games of this decade, ""The Stanley Parable"" brilliantly makes of self reflection a raison d'être.More than introspection we should probably talk about what we can call ""self extrospection"".The game's self extrospection is favored by making the player bring up and reflect over all of those things that he (or she) considers being implicitly existing in some formats (that a videogame can be beaten, that there are good and bad choices to make, that enviromental interaction gives positive feedbacks, et cetera), and, on the base of those reflections, pushes him to consider the meaning of such conventions, their real value and, with a more distant perspective, his own relation to them and his acceptance of rules in general.One of the central arguing points of the game is that the player, by systematically trying to apply the same mechanics he is usually applying to videogames in order to achieve the results he is used to achieve, is substantially growing accustomed to mechanically do the same thing over and over, without demanding anything extra-ordinary (uncommon) of himself nor leaving any space for free reflection. ""Stanley [...] has a job that demands nothing of him, and every button that he pushes is a reminder of the inconsequential nature of his existence. Look at him there: pushing buttons, doing exactly what he's told to do. Now, he's pushing a button. Now, he's eating lunch. Now, he's going home; now, he's coming back to work. One might even feel sorry for him, except that he's chosen this life."" As Stanley is not questioning the repetitiveness of his job so the player might not be questioning certain patterns that he is automatically following in his gameplay sessions; in The Stanley Parable these patterns are usually bringing the player to look for something that he's used to get in other games, only to end up getting it in a very ridiculing form (just think of the competitive leaderboards and the achievements).In most of the cases, by giving the players exactly the contrary to what they wanted from the game, The Stanley Parable pushes the player to obtain a sort of third person self analytical perspective (even intensified in one of the endings in whichthe game ends with a third person view on Stanley incapable of making a choice), the so called (by me) ""self extrospection"", in which he is asked to reflect on the nature of his impulsive attractions or behaviours. The arising questions and the following thoughts are many: is what the players are looking for something really worth to look for, or are they just grown accustomed to have it and therefore they're feeling its absence when it's not given to them? But it is only when this perspective is moved to other entertainment forms, which are also demanding nothing of people and just drench them with a shower of positive or shocking stimuli, that we can really start to question the level of free will that we possess; as Gustave Le Bon writes in his book ""The Crowd – A Study of the Popular Mind"": ”It is only by obtaining some sort of insight into the psychology of crowds that it can be understood [...] how powerless they are to hold any opinions other than those which are imposed upon them, and that is not with rules based on theories of pure equity that they are to be led, but by seeking what produces an impression on them and what seduces them.”How much are we automatically doing because we've been pushed to grow accustomed to it? Are we laughing at a video where someone crashes with a motorbike because it is really funny and not at all unethical, or are we doing that to relief some of our personal frustrations by watching someone else failing? ""Yes, it's all very amusing. And we laugh and we call our friends over and they laugh too and soon the whole world laughs and laughs and laughs at the man who failed. [...] But [...] you, sitting there: what have you gained watching this video? What have you learned?"" And if we do it because of the frustrating monotony of our life, why are we then allowing the frustration to latently exist? Are we so accustomed to our life as it is that we're scared of doing any changes? How many non-influenced choices are we making? What's the worth of those choices?Stanley might be starting to understand all of this: ""in and amongst his aimless meandering, I think he is actually beginning to discover something: he is getting closer to  an answer, an explaination, an exit. He is beginning to earn his freedom"", but he is a videogame character bound to narrative limits and cannot escape his own story. He is Stanley and can only be Stanley.But what about us?""Now, if I could truly put you in his shoes, to show you the paths he walked and the choices he made.. [...] soon you will be the one to walk: the controls will be in your hands. [...] Oh, I think I'm going to enjoy this. When you find out how alone you truly are.. I will be laughing more than anyone.""Is this a time in which we should break the old entertaining clichés of the videogame mediumand release some of its pedagogical potential? Afterall ""men never shape their conduct upon the teaching of pure reason"" as Le Bon writes, and we can deduce that they learn by empirically experiencing reality. But if the virtuality is empirically making them experience and hate their own reality, isn't that potentially a formative experience?Is this then a case in which ""ludus est magister vitae""?Well, it's certainly worth a thought.The Stanley Parable Personal ReviewRenzo ""Stermayer"" Arcuri"

Its the kind of game that sticks with you.I'd recommend you  to try every single possibility and get all endings, as the game reacts differently to all of them.My only gripe is that THERE SHOULD BE MORE OF IT.  I seriously hope the developers don't abandon this concept in future games.9.5/10"

It's hard to talk about the game wtihout giving away too many spoilers, much like other games on STEAM with a heavy aspect to the story to which TALKING about it exposes anyone who hasn't played it to be spoiled.This game is an experience that one has to journey through by themself, it is a choice in and of itself and will presented you as a giant ""what if?"" of video games.It is confusing, deep and sometimes emotional.

What can you do?  Walk around.  Sometimes, you interact with an object or two.  The only other being present is the brilliantly voiced narator.

There's only one way to find out and play it for yourself.It's hard to write about a game like The Stanley Parable.  The entire game is comprised of decisions.  You walk around, choose a path, and listen to some dialogue.  Sound boring?  Except the narrator has some of the most witty dialogue since GLaDoS and his humor really rubs you the right way.  The game is wrapped up in metaphors and sarcasm and open to interpretation.  It's up to you, the player, to decide what truly happens at the end of the day.  Yes there are set endings, but it's up to you to give them meaning.Even after I got all the endings, I found myself still playing it to find the small secrets.  It's rare that I touch a game after beating it (unless nostalgia calls), but I really just wanted more.  I wanted to hear the narrator more.  I wanted to see what little gems the developers had thrown in.While this review may have just made you more confused, just buy it.

However, there are some circumstances in which paying what feels like more-than-average is entirely okay. This is one of those cases.The Stanley Parable is one of the most original, creative, and though-provoking games (or THINGS, for that matter) I've ever played. Once you finish it, you've finished it. You can go back and do everything as many times as you want, but once you've done it, you've done it.And that's okay.I've played this game for about 6 hours (at the time of review) and while I've done pretty much everything there is to do, I've spent hours in reflection of what any of it means. You will learn from this game if you allow yourself to.It can be silly. It can be unsettling. Most importantly, it can be touching.I cannot recommend this game highly enough. If you're on a budget, waiting wouldn't hurt, but if its on sale for as cheap as it gets (I think around $3.75?), there's no reason not to buy it.I love this game, and it's made its way into my list of favorites with ease.P.S. If you don't like the fact that there is (for the sake of this review) no action, and you don't want to spend time listening to the narration, I do NOT recommend it. Its VERY VERY good, yes, but it may not be what some people consider 'fun' (although I presonally had BLAST with it)."

But oher than that, Stanley Parable IS NOT FOR EVERYONE. It is mostly for people who enjoy first person narrative games like Gone Home and people who love video game humour such as breaking the fourth wall. It is also very sarcastic and satirical. Poking fun at topics. Also you can show it to your friends. But most of the time they probably won't get the humour. The humour however is not a problem. It sets this game out from the rest. The backgrounds are fantastic making you want to EXPLORE the office. Do I even need to acknowledge the amazing Narrator's voice? It rivals Morgan Freeman. No, wait. Morgan Freeman only does awesome monologues. The Narrator does sarcasm, satire, sadness, humour, jelousy and much more. He is also British. That's cool.10/10 Must ownThis review will never end.

I can't believe I waited that long, because this is one of the most fun games I have ever played.Although it can get a bit confusing, I find that is what makes it fun. If you get this game, though, I don't reccomend reading any guides until you've had your fill of tooling around. To me, at least, it makes the suprising game much more fun.ProsFirst off, the price! I think this should be worth much more.The narrator has a personality, and will indeed say different things depending on what you do throughout the game.There are SO many different endings, and I'm currently trying to get to them all. That being said, it is a time-well-spent undertaking since each one (most of them, at least) eludes to a bit more of the.. ""Story""The story isn't actually a set one.The acheivements- take a look at them, real quick. The developers are genuises.Each of the endings gives you something different.Its freaking hilarious. That's the main thing.The creativity behind it all. Play the game to understand.ConsAs I said, it can get somewhat confusing, especially for gamers looking for a straightforeward story.The story is pretty wavering.

I won't give too much detail for fear of ruining it, but there often is a choice. Follow what you are told, or revolt against what you are told. It is up to you. I won't say any more.

You will learn to hate yellow lines and enjoy letting babies die in fires.Most games that attempt to be such adeconstructionare doomed to wallow in their own artiness.

,Recommended,221910,18853139,"Posted: 3 November, 2015",all,Dinoracha,"Taking directions in video games has become something we've all (generally) become resigned to; we read the manual, check out the controls menu, follow signs and hints in the environment, etc... In most cases, games follow a guideline and set limitations as to what extent you can deviate from the original plan or script, these rules becoming more lenient and expanded since the good ol' days of the NES and into the realms of MMOs and open-world exploration based titles. Still, seldom are you punished or scolded directly for wandering off the intended route; you may be given a time limit to return to the battlefield, come across enemy mobs too strong for you, or usually be met with an invisible wall or impenetrable barricade that artificially confines you. The Stanley Parable explores taking directions in rather clever ways, and while the game does have an impact regarding your choices, it tackles the subject from an angle of entertainment and comedy with less focus on inquisitive examination, and while I walked away relatively pleased in the end,  I was left hoping for a bit more education.The Stanley Parable is a game based on player choices and how a story can change accordingly, these changes being delivered and addressed by the narrator, Kevan Brighting, whose voice work is a highlight of the game. Brighting delivers all of his lines with a certain eloquence and gentlemanly grace, despite the range of moods he goes through as Stanley, the titular protagonist (and arguably antagonist, but we'll get to that later), shuffles along on his adventures. While the narrator doesn’t break his calm, reserved character despite your decisions, there are points where he has to become menacing, pleading or so sarcastically dry he could melt a glacier, and said eloquence is kept even throughout all these scenes. Since Brighting's voice is the one that guides you through the game's various routes, the fact his work is so clean, clear and best of all pleasant to listen to makes him a wonderful addition to a game that would've otherwise been about wandering aimlessly around.What intrigued me the most about The Stanley Parable was the Molyneux-esque aspect of the player being able to make choices that impact your progress. When you first start the game you're given an opening monologue about Stanley's job and how it's a heavily directed job with instructions coming to him via computer, but soon his incoming directions cease and he discovers that he's all alone in the office, and then the player takes control of Stanley. The narrator then tells the story about Stanley exploring his empty office, and eventually you come across two open doors; the narrator says that Stanley goes through one of them. If you follow the script, the story continues along giving you other chances to deviate from the intended script and the narrator will react accordingly. Following the script one hundred percent to the letter will have you completing the game in no time at all, rewarding you with a rather positive, if not insidious, ending... That is, if you follow the script. Let's rewind back to the first major choice Stanley has of entering door number one or door number two, and how the narrator dictates that Stanley chooses one, not the other - Or does he? Does he have to? The other door is there, wide open and leading somewhere else. The only thing stopping you from making Stanley go through the other door is what the narrator just said. There's a sense of mischief and empowerment of being able to deny the script and do what you please, even if your routes are clearly defined and refusing to follow said script makes you a nuisance more than an obnoxious rebel.This brings me back to the point of Stanley being both the protagonist and antagonist, depending on your choices. Regardless of whether you play nice or forge your own path, the story has to reach a conclusion, the narrator taking on different roles depending on your chosen route; he may resign in helplessness, be as confused as you are when assets being loaded in don’t fit the script or function, and he even becomes hostile and threatening when he tires of the foolishness. The different ways the story has to adapt to your decisions is the big draw and appeal to the game, but the massive flaw in The Stanley Parable is that once you go through a route and reach its ending, there is no point in going back to it. In fact once you find every possible ending in the game, there is practically no point in returning to it, unless you want to uncover each piece of the narrator's lines, find secrets or cash in on the achievements. Even then The Stanley Parable is quick to run out of things to do, giving it poor lasting power - Including some clowning around, I reached each ending, which had me clocked in at just over three hours when all was said and done. That's really the only thing that severely hampers the game, but at the same time I'm thankful that artificial time padding was omitted for a game that gets you in, offers up comedy and an incredibly well written and expertly voice acted script, then gets you out.The Stanley Parable certainly is not a replayable title, but as mentioned the lessons it teaches while being witty keeps it from overstaying its welcome and becoming a bore. I was amused and intrigued during my time with it, but I wished at times that the game was more informative to the player in an educational or logical sense along with its entertainment. For example, your choices have an impact on the narrator and the script, and because the story must reach an end, changes have to be made accordingly. While the results end up amusing, I had hoped there would’ve been a closer, deeper look on the matter from a game design standpoint. Of course, it’s a game about a man with a charming English accent narrating another man’s eventual subterfuge of the story, so intelligent, lengthy discussions on game design is not its goal. That said, if you're at all interested in logic and game design then The Stanley Parable is certainly worth your time, but only if the lack of major replayability doesn't have you turned off."

It follows a regular office worker named ""Stanley"" (whose job it is to push buttons on a keyboard) after all of his co-workers mysteriously disappear, and he starts to hear the voice of a mysterious narrator in his head.The Stanley Parable is at it's core an expermiment in player choice and how that effects gaming as a story-telling medium. It doesn't have any fancy butterfly effects it actually plays out more like a choose-your-own adventure book with preset paths and endings. With the player activating triggers by making choices that lead down branching paths toward one of a variety of endings.Beyond that core is a commentary on gaming and the medium that games present to a player, involving a main character with no personality beyond literally being the player, and a narrator (voiced by Kevan Brighting) who acts as a standin for the video game's developers. This story choice and meta commentary is neatly wrapped in surreal humor and wit, with the interplay between the players choices and the narrator's opinion on those choices being the focal-point of the experience, as well as the ultimate selling point of the advertisments.Yes, the narrator getting increaingly angrier the more you choose paths that don't lead to his prefered ending is a neat little cherry on top, but the humor also branches off into a variety of paths, involving anything from absurdly dark humor to surrealist nonesense and everything in between, it truley is a fascinating and involving group of experiences, that is worth the pricetag even in the face of how little guns you can use to shoot monsters and nazis.And if that doesn't have you sold, than the phrase 'Drugs and Hookers' is used in bitter spite at one point.

The circular nature is, in a sense, what defines it, and thus as a creative space to explore it succeeds, and this may very well prove its central thesis, but the crucial flaw is that ultimately, it stops being interesting.This is in part because it doesn't go anywhere. Even in the circular self-repetition it doesn't go anywhere. The layer of self-reflection is, frankly, not metafictional enough. It doesn't get to talk enough. It doesn't have the space to explore the futility of its own existence.

Farces are often highly incomprehensible plot-wise (due to the many plot twists and random events that occur), but viewers are encouraged not to try to follow the plot in order to avoid becoming confused and overwhelmed. [...] A farce is also often set in one particular location, where all events occur.Now let's speak in practical terms. TSP is technically a walking simulator. There is not much interaction beyond opening doors and pressing buttons. The game is about walking through different locations and exploring different scenarios.Of couse, TSP is much more than that, or it wouldn't have been the focus of so many articles in the gaming press, or have so many positive reviews everywhere (as here on Steam.)TSP is a deconstruction of structural narratives in gaming. It is best appreciated by gamers who've played plenty of scripted games, wondered at all about how such experiences are designed, or have become wise to the patterns and framework that hold a game narrative together.This mostly translates to you, the player, defying (or obeying) the narrator's instructions and seeing how that goes.Of course, those defiances and their effects are, in the end, just as scripted as the rest of the game. And the game is aware of it, deconstructing even that. Is your head spinning yet?All this to say that this is a very enjoyable, clever, funny experience. The narrator is brilliant in his delivery. The different branches and endings keep you interested for far longer than you'd expect. And I would suggest you resist the urge to go online and look at the game's unofficial wiki. Try to find as many paths and endings as you can, alone. Most are easy to find. Some are hidden.Is this game for you? If you've ever thought about how game stories are put together, then yes it is."

It is a walking simulator set in a bland office building. But, in a game like this, mechanics and visuals really don't matter. For this little game, all you need to worry about is the satirical narrator and your choices.The Stanley Parable is an extremely peculiar but hilarious game. The humor is witty and sarcastic, and on occasion, can be rather dark. Also, forget the fourth wall in this one; it is practically nonexistent. Of course, we have the narrator to thank for that. He is extremely reactive to the player's behavior and will comment on the strangest things. (Get the Door 430 achievement; that's one of the best pieces of commentary in the game!)However, he also has some moments where he will either rail on the player in a fierce rant, or seriously guilt trip him/her in a somewhat dejected manner. These rapid changes in his dialogue can be a little disarming but give the narrator more depth as a character (if that is how you see him), thus having the potential to affect the way you play the game.Despite its fantastic humor, the game's primary focus is on its philosophical topics. Most of the time, those topics dance around in the background and are alluded to by the narrator. Where the really shine is in the ""endings"". Each one, no matter how quirky or funny, has some sort of message to convey. Some, as would be expected in this type of game, focus on the nature of choices, and whether or not they matter. Others may touch on subjects such as the meaning of life or one's perception of reality. These ""endings"" can be incredibly thought-provoking and deep; one in particular left me staring at my computer for about 15 minutes in contemplative shock. And, when I describe it as a shock, it's not hyperbole.Of course, what you get out of said endings is completely up to you. How will you interpret the endings and what the narrator has to say about them?So, to sum it all up, The Stanley Parable is an extremely clever and philosophical game that is sure to keep the player's attention all the way through(?).

,Recommended,221910,8123859,"Posted: 19 December, 2013",all,lornlynx,"First, that game has hilarious narration.When looked at from one side, this game tells a short story about desperate worker class employant Stanley, who tries to escape the evil paths that were laid out before him. The narrator tries to help you on your path, and will respond to your choices with often unexpected and witty behaviour. Like, he will go angry at you when you refuse to leave the nice and cozy broom chamber, or get desperate when you try to ruin his narration by doing the opposite he tells you to. Then it also mocks you, either with giving you useless rewards or just offend you for even playing it. Worth a pretty good laugh and also an extremely likeable setting and characters.When looking at it from the other side, the game offers a deep philosophical discussion about choice, and how it influences our every lives on a daily basis. How it appears to be unique, to be freely available to have, almost a right to everyone. And how different choices in games are compared to choices in real life, and WHY we play the games we play. Why we emphasize on freedom of choice in games so much, even though there is no true freedom in a game ever to be had. But does this really differ from what we face in life, or is it just different approach to it?If you want to, this game can ask you a lot of question, and maybe also give you some answers. But don't expect them to come to you black in white, as the game is simply a discussion about choice, it doesn't try to answer it but moreso allow you to see it from different angles and then decide for yourself what you really want to believe.The game IS short, and it emphasizes multiple playthroughs and secret-searching to find the more than a dozen hidden endings and paths. Also it might be frustrating at times or even call you a fool, but it ever does it with a clear intention. It is NOT a game about progress, as you keep starting over and over again at the same place (which for sure is also an intention to reflect on vicious cycles we tend to run into).But it is a lovely game, and surely made a dent into the history of gaming (and into a few gamers brains), and I can recommend it to anyone willing to have patience with a game that revolves more around yourself and does have probably the most hilarious narration and unique humour a game had in the last few years.Also, if you decided to play it I suggest you watching this video AFTER you played it:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiCLKmEAa1IDON'T watch it before you haven't played at least through the most obvious paths and endings, as it takes away a lot of the charm of trying to find out yourself what something means and also spoils quite a bit.OH, and PLAY THE DEMO before you play the game or decide to buy it. It offers completely different content but in the same way the original does and is like a chapter on it's own.Also there is the mod which the game is based upon, still freely available to download here if you aren't convinced yet:http://www.moddb.com/mods/the-stanley-parable8"

The narrator tells you what to do and you follow his directions, or try to change the story by taking a different route. The narrator adapts to what you do through his dialouge as well as makes snarky hilarious comments towards you for not following him in the beginning. The more you change the narration the more he becomes frustrated and the more its noticable in the dialouge. No matter what you do, it seems the deveopers were planning on you being able to do that. In one instance you can glitch through a window to where you thought you had broke the game and exited the level, but nope. The narrator picks right up telling you ""I bet you thought you could get out of here"" ""is this what you really want? is to leave?"".The game is however a little short but there are so many different endings some more complicated than others and some very hard to produce. This can keep you playing for long after, trying to see all the different endings and experience all the hilarious and clever lines the narrator has.GraphicsThe graphics are average, but nothing to special. Its built on the Source Game Engine so think other source games such as half life 2, counter strike, etc.. Levels are well designed and their are lots of different areas to explore and check out, but first you must figure out how to get to them :).AudioThe audio in this game is by far the best part. The narrator is hilarious and clever and will keep you smiling and laughing while you try to trip him up. The actor chosen to voice the narrator was a perfect pick in my opinion. His voice stuck in my head for days after.SummaryThe stanley parable filled my need for a fresh game. The clever game design allows for so many different endings that will keep it feeling enjoyable as you listen to the hilarious narrator try to keep up with you as you try to trip him up. If your looking for something that feels a little fresh and will give you a good laugh then this will satisfy that."

It just likes to f#ck arround with you, to the point that you notice it, this game breaks the fouth wall as much as Deadpool, and it's probably as funny.As usual, let's start with the bad stuff: First of all, the price. The game nearly has no real gameplay at all, it's rather a weird interactive story...And yet it's priced 12€? Good thing I picked it up on sale, for 8€. Some might argue that it was still too much, but it was worth it for that price. I do recommend to wait for a sale. And that's it. That's the only bad things the game has, lack of gameplay, and a pricetag too high. What does this game do well?You start as a guy named Stanley, a man who's job is to push buttons. Wow, he already works more than the government. Suddenly, though, he got the feelingof...What?That's where you get in. This is not Stanley's adventure. This is your adventure, because you're Stanley, I'm Stanley, he's Stanley, everyone is Stanley. Well, except the Government, those guys are Doctor Rektus Retardus♥♥♥♥♥♥Evacuation II. You do what you like. You want to advance the story? Do it. You want to go and do what you like? Do it. You want to stay in your room and not play? THERE'S EVEN AN ENDING FOR THAT.That's the game's selling point. The fact that, in a story this dumb, and short, there's an amazing number or endings, some of them reaching high levels of originality, or just being rather surprising, and unexpected. Sorry, I just can't bring myself to spoil any of them (I did spoil the one about not leaving the room...But that's the easiest ending of the game, dude. It takes like 2 seconds). If you want to trully experience this game, DO NOT LOOK FOR GUIDES, DO NOT LOOK FOR PLAYTHROUGHS, DO NOT LOOK TO LET'S PLAYS, ONLY LOOK AT THE TRAILER, AND THE DEMO. The story of the game is pretty much 8/10 of the game, the other 2 being the amazing narrator, and you will have infinitely more fun if you don't expect any of that crap to happen.The game is NOT worth 12€, like I said. But in a 50% sale, for 6€? At that price it would be a SHAMEFUL DISPLAY not to buy it. It's your choice, Stanley. Buy the game, and have fun, or look yourself in the first room for eternity."

I was stunned to see I only played for 2.7 hours when writing this, because it feels like I spend a lifetime in this game, walking through the ever shifting and changing story, finding new paths with every turn.The Stanley Parable is about choosing or not choosing, following or disregarding the path laid out in front of you, and about one of the freaking best narrations in videogame history. And quite a few of the best jokes; I think the games that made me laugh the most were Portal 2 and The Stanley Parable. But not only laughter, also deep confusion, mindbending twists and moments of sadness are part of your way through the hallways.On a whole whether you should buy this game depends on what you want from a game: If you want hours upon hours of entertainment, this will not satisfy you. But if you value an interesting experience, even for a few bucks, this is definetily your thing!

It's a game for people who spend forever wandering and poking about in games, for people who try to break games, and for people who defy games' orders just to see if they account for it.That said, it's not without its faults. The most savage review of The Stanley Parable I've seen was by its own head developer and he accurately points out that TSP is complicit in everything it skewers for lack of ability to think of better options. Let's not throw the word ""genius"" around willy-nilly. ""Clever"" is more accurate. TSP isn't going to start a revolution in storytelling in games, in addressing the problems inherent in providing choice within pre-constructed environments, or anything of that sort.

,Recommended,221910,10958201,"Posted: 29 June, 2014",all,Sinishred,"Short Version:THIS GAME MAKESBIOSHOCK INFINITELOOK LIKEBAD FANFICTION. F**KINGPLAY THIS GAME.Long Version:The Stanley Parable is a game about possibilities. Every time you restart the game, you enter a parallel universe where everything is (almost) the same except for which actions the player takes, among a few other random variables (I.E. whether the floor is covered in papers). The game's sole purpose is to examine the very nature of storytelling in video games, pointing out just how ""fake"" the illusion of choice is, and laughing at the player for thinking they have some semblance of control over each predefined story branch.It's literally impossible to go into further detail without spoilingsomethingabout the game. There's no real gameplay to spoil - hell, the player can't even jump. The only thing you can do is walk around, push buttons, and choose whether to go left or right based on the narrator's dialogue. Everything else that matters about this game is the ways in which the game sets up certain expectations and then subverts the hell out of them in some spectacularily ballsy ways. I'm honestly amazed that thereisn'tan ending where the game crashes to desktop.I don't care who you are or what you're interested in. All I know is that if you call yourself a gamer, you need to play this game. For the love of whatever-your-diety-of-choice-is, just play this game. You won't regret it."
,Recommended,221910,19042005,"Posted: 12 November, 2015",all,Brian C. (The Schmaltzy Cynic),"I don't think it's a secret anymore as to why The Stanley Parable is special. The question you are probably asking yourself now if you haven't played it yet is the following: ""Is it worthPLAYINGrather than talking about it or watching a Let's Player?""The short answer to that question is yes, but only if you know what you're getting yourself into and if you want to go the extra mile to discover all the easter-eggs/fail-states/endings. After the first hour of TSP, I wasn't convinced of the game's merits, but after the next two hours of exploration alone, I was sold on the game. (Not including the demo's time.)And that's the keyword for what will ultimately make-it or break-it for you with TSP. Exploration.Do you enjoy satiating that burning curiosity of ""What if...?"" Do you enjoy rebelling to whatever you're being told? Do you wonder if there's always another means to an otherwise forced situation? Do you enjoy wasting the narration's time with your own?Then the Stanley Parable is for you.The First Step: Try the DemoNo, really. The Demo is completely separate from the main-game. You won't find it anywhere in the final game. (No sir, not at all.) Not only will the demo set your expectations for what TSP will offer you, but there are several easter-eggs to be found that will help you discover the many routes of the full game.Adding the free demo on top of the main-game will also extend your playtime for another hour. At the bare minimum. It all depends on how much you want to discover for yourself.Second Step: Play the GameWhen you start up TSP, the first thing you will want to do is enable save-states (and achievements, if you care about them). A single playthrough isn't long--anywhere from under a minute to 20 mins--so the game doesn't waste your time by having to replay the game for a single variation. Enabling the save-states is more convinent for you.(If you're worried you'll miss something by doing one thing, never restart unless the game does it for you.)Even when you enable the save-states and see all that there is to see, you will still get two to three hours of exploration, which I think is fine by me since I bought this game for under $4. You might have a different opinion. (I hope the creator has a bundle for TSP and The Beginner's Guide in the future since I think buying both would justify the purchase price.)Once you start playing the game, remember what the demo has taught you, and see just what there is in TSP to discover. You'll be geninuely surprised by what you'll find if you follow your curiousity and stay away from videos spoiling the surprise for you.Thankfully, if you are worried you are missing out on any of the ""endings"", there is a helpful guide to keep as a checklist without spoilers.http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=199001539And if you're worried that there's some deeper meaning behind the game and story-bits withheld from you to make the narrative better, then you can relax. All the story bits are explained, and the message is very obvious without being forced down your throat while the game revels in its absurdity.Step Three: Go Grab Lunch and Reflect on What You've Experienced (30 mins minimum)The Stanley Parable is definitely a game you will probably hear/talk about more about what it is about rather than playing the game. But playing the game is something you should experience as the questions it raises are a nice food for thought.Is the game pretentious? Absolutely, and the game is well-aware of itself. More so than other games that think they are self-aware, which might make TSP feel like the butt of its own joke. Yet it still feels worthwhile for what it offers.Is the game (or gameplay) lacking? Possibly. I know personally that when I play a walking simulator game, I want to look at the environment for subtle clues and anything hidden on the walls. Unfortunately, this is the only criticism I have for TSP. The board-room is the only area really worth looking into for that kind of content, which I think this game could've benefit from with a little more environment humor.(I also think if the game had Earthbound-like interactions with everything it could've artifically extended the gameplay for a few Earthbound fans with OCD. [Relax, I love Undertale and LISA.] But I don't think the game really needs this fluff.)Do I want to play the game again? No. Once you have seen all that there is to experience in TSP, you might bring it up for conversation about what the game is about. Or you might let a friend experience it for him/herself. But you dont' really want to play it again because you know everything.This game reminds me an awful lot of Jazzpunk, which I'm well aware that game came after TSP. I say this because that is how I experienced this game, and your experiences with other walking simulators (any Chinese Room game, The Vanishing of Ethan Carter, etc.) will probably be shaped by TSP. If you have never played a game like that before, then you might not have the same impression.But I bring up Jazzpunk for a good reason. I didn't like Jazzpunk because the content it provided was superfulous, nonsensical and felt unnecessary for the few laughs that I did get out of that game.But isn't TSP also a game of superffulous, nonsensical and uncessary gimmicks and choices? Yes, it certainly is a similar game in its design/mechanics.So what's the difference? The absurd humor of TSP feels more well-thoughout as the game's design actually accounts for all the choices you can make--which is a part of the game's message.The interesting aspect of TSP is how subtle those choices become from starting with two doors to... well, some of those choices would actually be spoilers. Just know that the game accounts for whatever you do, and as a result the game feels smarter than it first appears. And the writing quality matches the game perfectly.Step Four: Come Back Five Years LaterNo, really, the game wants you to not play this game for five years and then come back to TSP. Perhaps there is a secret waiting for you to make the wait worthwhile. A life-lesson you'll cherish as a reward for all the patience you gave the game.Or maybe, instead of coming back to the game, you'll remember the fun times you had with TSP. You'll have a laugh, a smile, maybe even cry a little out of joy. But you know you shouldn't return--you learned to move on with your life, and you know that TSP is happy for you. You don't need to play the game; you don't need its validation for your life. You are happy with the life you live...Or you can just mess around with your clock and see what it is like some people have already done."

You decide, but I honestly feel like it is the worst waste of time + money ever, and there are way more entertaining games.Is it a new concept? Not really... as a matter of fact, Portal follows a very similar principal (you are a test subject, and you choose to follow the robot voice or not to follow), but the commedy was 100% better, and there were actual puzzles to follow which is not the case here.

I didn't exactly know what I was paying for when I bought it, but I heard/read it was somthing amazing and this and that. I'm not usually swayed by those types of reviews but this one had some type of psycological lure to it I couldnt resist. The  demo didn't clarify the game for me but made me more curious, so I guess it served it's purpose (lol).... When I actually bought it I expected a challenge of some sort, and because I don't like to be spoiled I was reluctant to read some reviews labled 'spoiler' or watch many videos. When I realized the 'point' of the stanley parable was the whole spoiler nobody wants to give away I stopped playing, feeling the same way alot of other reviwers did. .

,Not Recommended,221910,10686272,"Posted: 22 June, 2014",all,ElectricHellKnight,"I picked this up on sale for $5.99, because I've heard good things and thought ""Only six bucks, why not?"". If I had paid the full price for this game ($14.99 as of right now), I'm sure I would have felt cheated and ripped off.Let me elaborate. The Stanley Parable is not a terrible experience. I say ""experience"" rather than ""game"" for reasons I will explain momentarily. The Stanley Parable makes some decent points about video games and video game narratives. There was some good work put into the project, and it does succeed in delivering its message.Here's the issue: There is nothing in The Stanley Parable that really justifies purchasing it. The entire lesson that it teaches (the very reason it exists is because the developers wanted to teach this lesson), could have been conveyed just as well (if not better) in a short video or a magazine article. You would gain just as much benefit from watching a walkthrough of The Stanley Parable as you would from actually playing it. The gameplay in The Stanley Parable is minimal. There are no items to collect, no secret doors to open, no objectives to complete, nothing to do besides listen to a voice lecture you. It actually makes matters worse that The Stanley Parable is well aware of how basic its gameplay is, and simply hangs a lampshade on the issue.As far as being a philosophical message about video games (and, in some ways, life itself), The Stanley Parable is great. As far as being a video game, The Stanley Parable is awful. It seems like The Stanley Parable is getting hailed as a form of highly intellectual entertainment that some people simply won't understand. The general consensus (whether the developers intended this or not) seems to be that if you don't like The Stanley Parable, it's because you simply didn't grasp its revolutionary and intelligent message. This is not true. The message, while interesting, is not complicated or highly intellectual at all. And if you didn't like The Stanley Parable, it's probably because you were disappointed with its basic gameplay and low amount of content.I don't recommend purchasing The Stanley Parable for full price. It might be worth picking up if you can snag it while it's on sale, but frankly, you might at well watch one of the many walkthroughs on YouTube. You'll get the same value without spending a dime."

On top of that it does add a couple of odd choices, especially for achievements.And this is the thing, it's odd, and this game makes a number of being odd. So if you're looking for something different, this will be it, the problem is that it's only going to be it for about 2 hours, and 2 hours of gameplay based on just being different just doesn't cut it.The main problem is that there's nothing really new. Portal for example is about the same price and provide about the same time of gaming until you solve it, but the difference is that Portal is a new concept, wich is not the case with the Stanley Parable.The Stanley Parable is only a different way to approach a story, and considering that almost €12 is overpricing it.If you want to try it out I recommend waiting for a sale of some sort, preferably half price or something."

Don't get me wrong I love when a game uses a narrative experience however in this game it's the only thing going for it. Let me repeat that, it's the only thing you'll get out this, better yet the game only has small replayablility at best.But I digress,if this game is on sale by all means buy it, chances are you will enjoy it,just avoid buying at full price."

What one finds in a game like this is not a single story. There is no right way to play this game. On your first playthrough you will really discover the type of person you are. The guy who does as he is told or the one who does not. However, These are all things that you have briefly read by others about the game. This part is for you. I say this with love my brothers and sisters. If you get this game and bash it, then you are just as myopic and misanthropic as the narrator makes stanely out to be. This is a great physcological game. You need to challenge yourself to defy the narrator and thats where the beauty comes in. The narrator, is not your average narrator. He is trying to work with you in one story, against you in another, and for the both of you in others. You will make him angry, you will make him happy, you will make him sad. The true beauty in this game is the dynamic range of emotions the narrator will expirence when you defy him. Imagine being the swellest guy in the world and you just want to help others. You have to help a man that the unthinkable happened to and he cant figure out why and you are the only one guiding him. Would you blame him or trust him? Thats for you to decide. Will the narrator cry with joy or repent with mallice thats for you to decide and for you to relate to. All in all the atmosphere is great, it most certainly is the most unique game I have played. Lastly, If you listen to this game not as a gamer not as a story hunter but rather with your heart, open mind, and your life expirences you find yourself feeling a wide range of emotions that compel you to do one thing on one play through and another on the other. This game really finds who you, who us, who we, the stanely's are. I do beleive the original asking price is a bit steep but scoop this gem while it is on sale and you will never regret it."

To me, the Stanley Parable was a kind of an unknown title - quirky, different, and I didn't know much of it aside from funny trailers and obscure reviews. I bought it when it went on sale.After about 6 hours, maybe much less, I'm kinda done with it. If's an interesting exercise, not much of a game. I mean, there is an idea of a game there - but that game is ""try to see something different by doing things you haven't done yet."" As weird as it sounds, that's basically what this game comes down to.I chuckled a few times, sat puzzled a few times, became unsettled a few times - and as interesting and as good as those few experiences are, once you've had them theres no need to go back and have them again. The game isn't a never-ending list of endings or choices - there are a variety of ways to play (plots to see) but the list is finite. I don't see any free additions coming any time soon. (I could be wrong on this point)At the end of the day there are worse titles you could spend your money on. The Stanley Parable is an interesting diversion, to be sure. For a cheap price it's probably worth the experience, but do yourself a favour - if you do get tSP don't read spoilers, or walkthroughs, etc. If you do, the experience will be weakened and yes you will get to experience everything, but once you do you'll have no reason to go back. It's the feeling that there may be a different way to play that will keep you coming back. But once you know the endings, and the choices you need to make to get there, then that feeling will very likely go as will be your desire to keep playing."

But ""play"" here is more of term for acting out a part than engaging in a game. The Stanley Parable is barely even a game, but instead an interactive fiction that entices you to go down the same doors again and again in the hope that you will see all of the games many endings. There's nothing to collect, no one to kill, and you can't even jump. You just turn down halls and go down doors. On papar, this may sound boring, but the way it's done is the charm of the game. The Narrator is reminiscent of Portal's Glados: you're never quite sure if he's your friend, your enemy, or your master. 40% of the games enjoyability is because of him and the voice actor who plays him. The rest of the enjoyment is deciding what path to go on or just finding new ones. Each of them means something.

With terms like ""Triple-A"" starting to define the success of a game before it even comes out, and stellar games like Thief getting unwarranted mediocre reviews, it's great to see a title be all like, ""nah brah, I'm gonna do my thing.""The Stanley Parable really makes you think, and not in a ""I must solve this puzzle to advance the story"" kind of thinking. The Stanley Parable is trying to teach you something. Hell, a lot of things. It's a game for the philosophical types who want to learn more about themselves and what they value. And the replayability is phenomenal; there are numerous ""endings"" (play the game to see why I put endings in quotation marks).The only thing frustrating about this game is the achievements. Made to mock achievements in general, the achievements themselves choose to gravitate to the polar ends of the difficulty spectrum. Some of them are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ly easy. Some of them are nearly impossible, which forces you to cheat. But as frustrating as the achievements may seem, even the achievements are teaching you something. It's your job to figure out what.I think there needs to be more games like this.

This game is critically-acclaimed, and it definitely wants you to know how clever it's being, which is very, very clever indeed. But at no point in the entire game do you feel like you're being talked down to, instead you always feel like you're in on the joke.If you think I'm being cryptic, it's because the less you know about this game the better. To spoil even one single thing about this game would be to deny you the kind of experience that I personally haven't had since the first time I played the original Portal. To say even that much, is to say too much.Essentially, The Stanley Parable is a satire of game-design. It uses the single biggest thing that differentiates games from other mediums, the interactivity, in a way that is so genius that it essentially manages to completely invert the relationship between player and game that has been the same since the earliest days of game design.The ideas here are not completely original of course, which has caused some people to say that this game is not as clever as it thinks it is. I disagree with that assertion. Comedians often tell jokes that are really quite obvious in retrospect, usually about quite mundane things that most people think in one way or another. The genius is in seeing the humour at the heart of the observation and crafting it into a joke. The same phenomenon is at work in this game.In closing, I realise that you want to know more; you want to just read one more review or watch a quick video of the game before you play it. I urge you, nay, beg you, to resist the temptation to learn more. There are very rare occasions where the benefits of going in unprepared outweighs the risk of buying a game you might not like. This is one of those times.Feel free to blame me if you end up hating the game. I'm more than happy to live with your hatred, safe in the knowledge that I gave you the best possible chance of experiencing what I consider not just one of the best games of 2013, but one of the most important games ever made."

A story about a man, a man that can be any person on this planet who so desperately wishes to be free from everything. It was an amazing adventure for me as a gamer and I can truly tell that this game is worth the full price, it may not last long and sometimes you may think it's boring to no end.

It has great humour throughout the game which made me laugh quite a few times. Also the art style is great, and I love the narrator's voice which does add to the already present humour as well.I also like the fact that there are multiple endings, but this does bring in my only negative opinion of the game. It's too short in my opinion. I went through practically every ending in about 4 hours, but then I realised that that was it, there wasn't really anything left to do. [[SPOILER STARTS]] Sure, I could go and play that baby minigame for 4 hours to get another ending, which is a cool added feature to put in to get another ending, but after that there's nothing else left [[SPOILER ENDS]].Overall, I really did enjoy this game, I thought it was cleverly done, and the narrator's voice and humour reminded me of Wheatley from Portal 2. Also it looks like a proper retail release game. However, I don't think this game is worth £10 since there's only about, at max, 5 to 6 hours of gameplay.HOWEVER, if it is on sale for £5, maybe £6, then do buy a copy. I do recommend this game a lot, just be prepared to only play the game for that 5 hours.

The Stanley Parable puts you in the shoes of an office worker who suddenly finds everyone has disappeared. A narrator begins to set up the plot, and from there everything goes wild. I cannot say too much without ruining the first-time experience you *desperately* deserve for a game like this, so I'll try to stick to the mechanical aspects. The control system is your typical WASD/mouse navigation. Your character, unlike many FPS games, has no jump function (try it anyways and see what happens) because you're walking a linear (HA!) path the entire time.Your interactivity with the environment is limited. There aren't very many objects you can physically manipulate besides those necessary for progression. The narrator, on the other hand, will have something to say about almost everything. The graphics are pleasing to the eye, and the game is well optimized, running perfectly fine even on integrated laptop graphics cards. The environment has a soft, clean feel to it. Don't come here for realism.Lot's of fun passive background humor and gags. Take the time to stop and read notes and examine documents and pictures. You'll notice something new every time.I will say that this game has endless replay and exploration value. No two playthroughs will be the same. Expect dark humor, dry wit, complete lunacy, tranquility, hostility, happiness, and fear. This game will take you from laughing your♥♥♥♥♥off to a sobering, thought-provoking state. It's a beautiful demonstration of the concepts of free will, causality, fate, and sense of individuality. Just how much are you in control of your life?

Stanley's journey through his suddenly depopulated office building resembles a dark and wildly goofy Choose Your Own Adventure book more than anything else. Although your capacity for interacting with the world is (almost) limited to walking around, your every choice has impact and consequences, and even though these consequences are then mocked and dissected every step of the way by the fickle Narrator, it still results in one of the most satisfying comedy games I've ever seen. I intended to spend an hour or so getting a taste of the game last night; instead, three hours in, I wound up inviting over a couple of friends to take turns scrounging out new content and endings. If you liked the humor of Portal but could do without quite so many puzzles, if you enjoyed Hard Rain but felt lied to by the fact that your actions didn't have nearly as much influence on your destiny as the box promised, or if you just love solid satire and consideration of game design, life, the universe, and everything, pick up The Stanley Parable.PS - Broom Closet ending FTW."

,Recommended,221910,16540262,"Posted: 19 June, 2015",all,Aroject,"Alright, here is the deal. I've read a lot of the reviews both posative and negative; the way I see it is that both sides are mostly right in their views / reasoning. I very much enjoyed the game and I feel that it is a bit short. I would love to see a second game or even an expansion. Sadly it looks like that will not happen any time soon. The Stanley Parable is very clever and at times quite funny. I purchased the game on release at full price. While I do think that anything over $10 USD is pushing it as a reasonable price for what you get here, I -personally- don't mind that I payed full price. My reasoning is that TSP is something semi unique, a fresh new concept, and an over all enjoyable experience; this is something I'm willing to pay extra to support. Because if we don't support the things we enjoy they stop existing. Having played the game to it completion - would I still pay full price? Sure. Should you pay full price? - probably not unless you agree with my reasoning. If you ever see this game for anything below $5 USD I would sugest you pick it up and give it a play. TSP is a very plesant way to spend a few hours, I shell out significantly more money than that to go to the movies and I only get about 2 hours of entertainment for that, assuming the movie isn't a horrible train wreck like most big budget movies are these days.TL:DROne of the better things you could spend $5 (USD) bucks on. Only pay full price if you want to support the devloper and independent games."

Your head will explode. In a good way.No puzzles just you and your choices.If you love all kinds of video games, enjoy reading books & writing. This game is for you.If taking a good hard look at yourself and understanding why something as silly as an achievement would keep you from enjoying a video game sounds fun! This is for you as well.I never check the achievements before I play a game anymore. Something I enjoyed doing for years.It is a list of spoilers.If I had looked at the achievements before playing i would have probably had a mediocre time and nomagical, profound & memorable momentsIt would have completely ruined the suspension of disbelief that is at the core of immersion in video games.That's it.This is all about you now.You can go and look at the achievement list and ruin the game for yourself.Freewill & all that jazz.Or you can start the game without knowing anything about what will happen next and rememberwhy you play video games in the first place.TB;DRI had an ""out of hobby"" experience withThe Stanley Parableit is truly a mind ♥♥♥♥ of the highest order."

Aside from that, the ingenius, Kaufman-esque narrative within a narrative the game presents you is both side-splittingly hilarious and spine-chillingly poignant.  Crisp graphics, immersive sound design and a FANTASTIC voice-over job from the Narrator all contribute to what is essentially a thought-provoking work of interactive art.  This is the direction that video games need to go in for the medium to transcend its story-starved misogynistic miasma of bullets and blood (alliteration makes me sound smart!)."

This has very little.What to say about The Stanley Parable apart from it is one of the wittiest games I have ever played. The player starts off with an introduction to the game. The Narrator introduces the character, Stanley, of course. After this short but witty introduction, the player is then thrown into Stanley's shoes with only the guidance of the Narrator to help the player on their way.As said before, the gameplay is fairly low, with only a few commands and inputs the player can do. Including, turning off computers around the office, opening and closing a few doors around the building and general movement. Heck the player cant even jump, though, even this can be funny as they will receive an achievement for at least trying.I cant really say much about the story without ruining it for everyone. But what I will say is that is has many different paths the player can take. These paths are usually formed when disobeying the Narrator's guidance, leading to some stunning writing. Each time the player feels like they have outsmarted the Narrator but he always seems to be one step ahead.Although the game is low on features and gameplay in general, it is still addicting and a swell game to play. However, this is another game to wait for the price to drop or for it to be on sale as the price does not truly match the content. Either way, it is a solid 4/5 star game!"

Running counter to how choice in most other games works, The Stanley Parable makes you feel as though everything has been planned out- you were always going to make that choice, and the story continues as such, narrating your tries and desperate hopes to thwart the game's removal of the choices that it presents you with.The effect that this creates is not one that I have the words to describe, but led me to play it again and again, hoping to discover all of the myriad endings that I could.The Stanley Parable is impossible to explain, but its take on the nature of choice in games is one that I'm glad i had the pleasure to experience."

One day, the monitor doesnt tell him what to do. Confused, Stanely decides to find out what is up. Thus starts a run of the mill computer adventure.That is, unless you decide to take the wrong door.THen the fun starts.Its a short game, or at least this run through was - I imagine there are many more paths to take and ways in which to frustrate the Narrator. Imagine a Choose Your Own Adventure, where the book keeps getting increasingly confused and snippy in its tone as you made ""choices"" it didnt like. That is The Stanley Parable, and it really just goes to show how arbirary and silly the idea of ""choice"" in video games really is.Try the demo first - its free, and gives you an idea of the tone of the game.

So let me actually explain the game so you can make an educated decision whether it is worth your time and money.First of, this is not a game like anything you have likely played before, there are no puzzles and no action.  It is the spiritual successor of a text based adventure game on a 5 1/4 inch floppy disk I used to play on my Apple IIe.  Put another way, it is like playing a ""chose your own adventure novel.""  There are dozens of endings (most of which involve death or worse), and nearly all of them can be achieved in 2 hours.  But like reading a novel, it is the journey not the destination that matters.  The primary story mechanic is the relationship between you (Stanly) and the narrator, and while this might sound limiting, the developer’s ability to truly make you feel like Stanley by using the narrator to tie your actions and choices into the narrative is compelling.  Furthermore, the narrator's dialogue is equal parts satirical, profound, and hilarious, presented in the spirit of Douglas Adams and Monty Python.I hope you can decide for yourself if this is worth your money, Personally I paid 5.99 on sale and have no regrets, I compared it to purchasing a good graphic novel.  That said, I would have been disappointed if I'd paid $15 for it.I hope this review helps.  In the timeless words of Obi Wan Kenobi,""You must do what you feel is right of course."""

And if you don't remember any, then try and play through some of the older ones until you find some.Else you would beat this game in probably 10 minutes, and that wouldn't exactly be worth the 12 €.But I will say this, if you're looking for action and don't have much patience, don't bother playing it.Chances are your boring daily life with a severe lack of stimuli will make you hate this game."

As a professional voice actor myself, this game and the indescribably virtuosic performance of Kevan Brighting is arguably one of the greatest video game voice roles ever.Couple that genius with the writing, which could easily be misattributed to one of the head Valve writers. It's both wildly entertaining, while also, unlike nearly any other game, making you ask why. Why did you make THAT choice at THAT time? What would have happened if you'd made a different one? Would you feel better? Worse? Whose shoe is that? Why do I sometimes feel trapped in an endless circle of tedium and despai--anyway.My two tips:1) Go in the broom closet and stay for a while. Despite what the narrator may say, it DOES have a purpose. Think about it.2) However tempting, DO NOT take the ""ESCAPE"" route near the big doors down the hidden elevator until you've played through the game a lot. It contains spoilers for nearly everything else.Buy this game. Love it. Enjoy it. Let it consume you. Show it to your friends. Join us. Soon, very soon now, will you even be players anymore?

How much should you pay to play this game (i.e. is it worth it if not on sale)The first question is easy: YES! It is amazeballs! Do not expect a game in the normal sense of the word though. Expect an experience. I found it funny, sad, depressing, uplifting and (mildly) insulting at some times and I loved it. When faced with choices and when you wonder what to do ask ""what does your heart tell you"" - (Amanda Bynes in She's the man).The second question is not easy. If you equate value to time spent enjoyably (I do usually), and if you get annoyed if a relatively expensive game is over in 4 hours (I'm looking at you Kane & Lynch and Homefront) it is probably better to buy it on sale. It has replay value for sure, but in the same way that you can read and re-read a book. If you equate value to the richness of experience then you are more than justified in paying full price for it. It is worth every cent.Also if you are super loaded and don't care about price, feel free to buy me stuff. I don't mind charity :)TL;DR: AMAZEBALLS! GET IT!"

In this game you play as Stanley, a grossly typical office worker, who's job is to push buttons.  When Stanley finds that one day, all of his coworkers are gone, it is up to the player to investigate just what's going on.There are many endings that provide an entertaining conclusion to Stanley's incredibly repeatable story.  If you do not wish to simply look up the endings, you are entitled to hours of fun, searching for all the endings.The game is very short, but the it loves to reset itself once you run into one of the many comical roadblocks that you'll eventually find.  The omniscient narrator provides interesting commentary, as well as playing the role of a partner of sorts.  He'll comment on your decisions, (or lack thereof, in some cases) and will also give you certain ideas as to what comes next.The game is immensly enjoyable, but has one flaw: this is simply an hd re-release.  Instead of paying fifteen dollars, you can quite easily install the mod as long as you own half-life 2.  This version features nothing in terms of additions, save for the narrator.  You are essentially paying fifteen dollars for some mp3 files.  While he does add some flavor to the game, he can be rather arbitrary at times, and ruin one's immersion.

The Stanely Parable couldn't be a film, a book or a radio drama because no matter how good they are, they lack two key things - participation, and the ability to restart. Only in games does restarting change anything. In The Stanely Parable, it has the potential to change everything, and keep changing everything, right up to the point where you realise that you are in fact changing nothing. This constant feeling of 'it's about this...wait...actually it's about that' is what this game centres around. You will feel trapped, liberated, antagonistic, companiable, satisfaction, guilt, unease and serenity, sometimes all within the same playthrough. It's not something that demands anything technical of you, but it is a game.

The Stanley Parable is unlike any other game I`v seen before mostly because it never gets old. there are many choices you face in the game for example I don`t want to spoil to much but in the beginning of the game you will face two doors depending on which you choose will lead you down a another path. But what really amazes me is that the game gives you the freedom to make the choices you want to choose, While other games usually have an invisible barrier of somekind blocking your path from certain hallways, in the Stanley Parable you are aloud to walk down those hallways. For example I was playing the game for about the third or second time looking for a differnt ending. I passed the door towards the end of the hall I always past. But then the idea ran through my head what if I could open it. I never tried it before because in most other games I had played I would try to open doors and nothing would happen. But to my suprise the door opened. In I stepped a broom closet. I don`t want to give away to much but the narrator after that told many jokes for example< ""there`s nother in there"" and ""oh I suppose next time you see your friends your going to ask them if they ever got the broom closet anding in the Stanley Parable"". To wrap it all up, this game is amazing I think everyone should enjoy the experience of the game that feels like it never ends."

For literally any type of gamer out there!The game breaks the fourth wall, with a narrator giving you instructions periodically that you can choose to follow or ignore. This type of playstyle completely immerses you in the game as you can choose to defy the game itself or follow it's request.Pros: The game has roughly 9 endings-Many easter eggs that are actually quite humerous and worth finding-Extremely funny game that literally allows you to temporarily explore other hit titles with a humerous twist!-Could probably run on a potatoe! ""that was a joke obviously"" but will run on pretty much any machine!cons: Honestly the only con is that there needs to be even more endings! The humour in this game along with the easy to follow learning curve makes this game insanely fun, and personally I would like to have more of this game to explore.Overall: This game is hilarously funny, charming, and satisfying. Even the achievements have twists that will make you chuckle if not straight up laugh.

Even better than playing yourself is giving the controls over to someone who has never seen or played the game themselves and just carrying out your own little experiment.- How easily manipulated is the gamer?- Will they follow orders because the narrator says to do so, or will curiousity get the better of them?- How far will they go if they DO decide to do their own thing?- Just how defiant / curious can a person be?There are simply so many things you can discover about a person's personality that this game is more than a game, it's a personality quiz. It's not so much what they do after several playthroughs, but what they do in the first or even second playthrough that makes it so interesting. You could give the game to several people and the interesting thing is how susceptible they are to simple and subtle instructions.Are we really that easily manipulated? Are we really part of an endless Matrix? Is everything a lie? What happens if I don't conform? How afraid am I to not conform?

It explores themes of free-will, control, power, freedom of choice, and exploits it all in a hilarious Portal-esque format where the player develops a relationship with a maniacal narrator over time. I cannot overstate this enough: this game is HILARIOUS.The itch to restart and think ""Well, what would have happened if I had gone through that other door?"" is so strong throughout the entire thing. The game is begging you to play every way possible and find out every ending.There's also very deep moral and philosophical quips of witticism in the narrator's dialogue, which really makes you stop and think about the game's message. It's a heavily self-referential game at times as well, knowing very well that you're a player controlling a chracter playing the game, and it acknowledges this many times throughout the game.It's a really, really wild thing to describe.

Each possible ending gives you a new look on the relationships between the narrarator, the player, the character of Stanley, and the construct of the game itself in almoast every possible combination.For somthing that on the surface seems to just poke fun at other games, it has the strange ability to still feel like you playing a game. It's very immersive, yet not in the sense that you forget you're playing a game (like how people use immersive in games like Skyrim). As you are playing the game you are drawn into believeing that the game itself is what it trys to be, just another 'walking simulator', just for the breakdown of its mechanics right infront of you to have all the more impact.It is truely an experiance to be had."

It is a first person narrated interactive adventure and it is LOADS of fun. I heard about how good it is from various sources but I hesitated towards buying it as I thought it would not be my kind of game. But it is ... it is my kind of game ... and most probably it is your kind of game too. Because it is very well scripted, nicely exectued and even makes you think about the mechanics of modern games. About how the achievements have no real meaning and about video game cliches. When talking about achievements I have to mention that this game is merciless to achievement hunters. Especially 3 achievements require either file editing, computer time tuning or just plain luck. Base game took me about 6 hours, the extra 25 are for one achievement. Overall this game was well worth the price and while being a bit limited in what you can do it still offers a different view on video games.

The writing/voiceacting is so good that you want to find every little piece of dialogue and detail this game has to offer, which is quite a bit. The replayability is pretty low in my opinion, once you know where everything is and see all the endings, there's little point in experiencing it again unless you're showing friends. Or getting achievements, some of which are quite ridiculous. Pulls similiar stunts to antichamber, but in a much classier and insightful way.

Both the demo version and the game are worth playing since the two have different story-lines. The gameplay, through surprising, is a little lacking, through.The more you get daring with it, the more the Narrator, AI and interactivity feels alive.Whether you pursue or undergo the Stanley story, you will need some basic measure of imagination to make any part a whole and fill in the blank yourself to get a real gut-wrenching and complete experience.If you can feel and have even a silver of imagination regarding SF, supernatural or horror, then the story will be there, more clear, strong, and real than many indie exploration games. It won't disappoint you.[LOW SPOILERS]The only thing that makes the game interesting and keep you from feeling discouraged are the mysterious natures and different behaviors of the Narrator. Whatever or whoever you see it as, it is difficult to know if the character of The Narrator changes depending of your choices, or if they had already reached secret conspiracies, sentience, and/nor hopes and your choices just push it to reveal. That adds up to the mystery and keeps encouraging exploration and curiosity, to the point that it helped me accept not reaching a solid One True Ending and still feel a sense of completion.If you don't count yourself, there are three characters present and able to interact together, two of them being eloquent and lovable disembodied voices. Even the developers aka The Line, the Confusing Schedule and the whole office building can be relatively counted as a independent character. In that way, the Stanely Parable may be considered part RPG."

Some will know it to be a boring cubicle worker simulator, and leave it at that. Others will find it to be a hilarious parody of human entropy. Despite this, it does carry a deeper meaning which it holds no restraint to point out.

Every now and then you can still hear the echoes of her nagging or condescending voice that gives you chills. You can still feel her trying to compress everything that you love, to drive out what makes you unique. The pressure and anxiety of having to deal with her every day was only intensified by the fact that you couldn't simply walk away. Things weren't that easy, they could never be that easy. She had her hooks sunk into you and all you could do was writhe, hoping that the pain would eventually end.And yet at the end of it all you wouldn't trade the experience for anything, because it taught you what true horror looks like. However a part of you wonders how things would be different if you didn't have that lasting scar on the back on your mind, the ever present sting of a wound that may never fully close. Sometimes you just stare off blankly and wonder how things got so chaotic, how things spiraled to where you are now. You wonder how many pills it would take to end it all, or maybe a small incision straight up your forearm. How long would take before the darkness consumes you and pulls you into the cold abyss? What would your final breath feel like?I believe I may have digressed. Great game, give it a shot."

As you walk, the narrator says what you are about to do before you actually do it. Once the player realizes this, they have a choice to rebel, or go along with what the narrator is telling the player to do.When I first played this game, I took it somewhat seriously and actually had a lot of fun with it. I was paranoid in my actions, touching every door, reading every whiteboard, staring at every picture... Okay, I took it more than somewhat seriously, and quite honestly, I don't think that's a bad thing. Some enjoy just cutting to the chase and listening to the narrator, some enjoy being confused, and then, there are some like me, who want to figure out and understand the game.In short, in the Stanley Parable, you walk around, and you walk through. You think, and you don't think. You listen, and you don't listen. You make rules, and you break rules. But, most importantly, you walk and listen to excellent commentary given by none other than the impeccable Kevan Brighting. He does an amazing job when voicing the narrator, and I would be very surprised if there has ever been a person who has made the narrator yelled and not at least smiled. Overall, this game is  a masterpiece, especially considering how much of nothing is in the game. However, that nothing is fulfilling enough to earn a 9/10 rank from me. I think it could use some more story, more options, and more endings, but I suppose that's the point, isn't it? The only reason why it is a 9/10 instead of a 10/10 is because there is simply not enough of the game."

See, I'm writing this because, during Black Friday 2016, Steam will give me a little badge for writing something. What is a Steam badge to me? Do I really care about it or is it just an excuse I create on my own, because it's fun to me? This review lacks any depth because my motives are shallow or am I so lazy, so apathetic, so weak, that I need whatever little motivation just to do what I want? I'd go for the latter.There are games that enslave you and games that make you more free as a person, as a human being. But, in the end, it comes down to the person playing the game. Are clicker games a game or a task? Why did the Pokemon GO phenomenon directly affect people's reality? I won't judge this ethically. I don't know if it's good or bad, but, aesthetically, some actions are uglier than others, sometimes you'll feel that you're wasting your time when playing a videogame and you're not even having fun. You're Stanley, you're just pressing buttons on your little office, isolated from the world.You should immerse yourself in The Stanley Parable; it will enslave you and it will free you at the same time. Go on and follow the lines, press door 430 five times, play the stupid games that here are a sarcastic comment about fiction but in other games are considered the norm, and you'd just swallow them without questioning.The Stanley Parable is the best investment of your money and your time. You won't get your money back but there is a possibility that you change and know yourself a bit more.

There is an achievement called ""Go outside"" which is quite fun and can only be obtained by not playing stanley parable for 5 years.

It is an incredibly linear game, but one that allows you to choose which way to wave in and out of the line to see a different result. It is short, but only as short as your imagination allows you to think – what if I turned around and walked back through the other door? Would something change? It is repetitive, but incredibly variable – one branch can lead to a potentially different outcome.For all The Stanley Parable is (and isn't), it is an incredibly clever take on the adventure game, driven by charm, humor, and a personality that makes waking up worth every trip down the hallway.Stanley is an ordinary person that works at an office with a specific job: to press the corresponding buttons on his keyboard when the monitor tells him to. Endlessly. One day, The monitor gives no more instruction, and his coworkers have all disappeared, and your goal is to find out why.Pros:+ Hilarious. The narrator is the real star of the show, and his writing is always perfect.+ Always a bit different. Every time you play, something else seems to be a bit different than before. Annoying the narrator over and over with repeated clicks or standing in a room trigger some of the best lines.Cons:- Once you've seen it all, it's all done. No real replayability.Try not to look at guides until you've hit a wall on finding new things. Don't be afraid to walk backwards. And never play this without sound. An awesome game."

That is, of course, assuming you think the missing splendor of your life is a videogame. Whatever might be the case, from life affirmations to an important shift in perspective, The Stanley Parable will make you laugh and then make you cry when you realize it's content mirrors the nightmarish existence shared by so many. Playing as Stanley, you'll be forcing him out of his accepted routine into foreign and beautiful landscapes such as the office break room, thrusting him into such great heights as his bosses office where yet even more surprises await. Expect the unexpected, the outlandish and the sobering. The Stanley Parable is a humorous teacher armed with a ruler to thwack you on the back of the hand should you decide to settle for what is merely comfortable in life; and should you choose to disobey what you loathe, prepare to be slapped across the head with a gold-star sticker and then booted out into your newly found adventerous side.

Guided, aided, (sometimes hindered) and instructed by a God-like narrator, the player is free to explore a complex and unusual building, able to make their own choices, decisions and actions. What makes this game so unique is that each path the player takes, can lead to a wildly different outcome. There are no shortages of routes to take, secrets to uncover and adventures that await.For me, this game had an almost-eerie feeling; a rather puzzling atmosphere where the controller, unlike in many other games, actually has complete control over the progression of the game. Without a doubt, this game has been an interesting and unique experience.Positives and Negatives:+ Unique Concept+ Multiple Endings+ Voice Acting+ Artistic, Comedic and Bizarre+ Good Value-for-Money- Replayability**While this game did captivate me, it was not enough to keep my attention for very long.Overall Rating: 7.5 / 10"

He couldn't even manage to right a single decent review without mooching off the incredible style and charm the The Stanley Parable has to offer, or without referencing the hilarious ways with which the title reflects on videogame tropes and stereotypes.Yes, it is a shame such a sorry soul must reach out to anything he can grasp in order to feel relevent on this program we all call Steam... but fear not, for he shall live on as the least awe-inspiring reviewer of the most awe-inspiring game: The Stanley Parable."

So this game really is about the side content.

An interesting and humorous analysis on game narrative, choice, player & character connection and interation. You are an office worker by the name of Stanley, who has realized that his job of pushing buttons on command has come to a halt and everyone in his office has vanished. While going about your quest to figure out where everybody disappeared to, you are guided by a narrator who explains what your next course of actions must be for you to succeed. You can choose to obey the narrator, disobey, disregard, or just do absolutely nothing while funny dialogue happens. This description is only dry since the best way for you to get what this game is 'bout is to pick it up and play it. Doesn't take terribly long to beat, the humor is spot-on and witty, and the achievements are rather humorous and compliment the ambitions and expectations that come with games/gamers as of late."

Well The Stanley Parable can probably be considered the closest equivilant to this, except that it's not a movie but a game. That is the genius of the whole thing; It manages to convey its own messages while not only preserving the mechanics of a videogame but rather making the videogame interaction between the player and the game the centrepiece of the show.The theme of the game is choice, consequence and control, mostly within other videogames. Numerous hidden endings and paths provide the motivation and drive to continue playing whilst the incredibly well-written humour keeps the game hugely enjoyable throughout.The only problem for a reviewer is that it is INCREDIBLY difficult to actually describe the game or tell you what it's about without giving away anything so I'll conclude by simply saying that this is an absolutely must-play and £10 is a very reasonable price for just how much you'll enjoy this game assuming you like intelligent humour and satire."

Or, perhaps, will he simply close his door and pretend everything is okay? It's a big, scary world out there after all. Regardless though, the decision is entirely in your hands.Seriously though, this is a game that's not a game. It's an experience, with tons of easter eggs, many different endings to discover, and which defies all the standard rules of gameplay. Will you heed the wise advice of your all-knowing narrator? Will you go your own way and see what secrets there are to be found? You set the rules and decide how you want to play. And, best of all, can find a different experience waiting for you every time.

There isn't really a goal in the game other then make choices, like choosing to go right, instead of being told that you have to go trough the left door by the Narrator. You'll find out what's on the end, if you pick the right endings.The NarratorThis is the single most important person in the game, other then Stanly. He makes the game work, makes the office better by opening, closing and somehow magically shifting rooms around so you'll go the right way. He explains what you're supposed to do, and what not to do. You can choose to either rebel against him, doing the oppisite or the wrong thing, like picking the right door instead of the left. He makes it all work, because without him, its just a game where you wonder in an office, doing nothing, at all.Story setting and GameplayThe story is actually being made with the choises you make. Of course, the Narrator has it written down somewhere, this'll become clearer in some endings, but the more you drift off the course, the more mad he becomes. It's really well written, has good humor and is a refresing story/expierence to haveAbout gameplay, well you walk in an office, pressing a button when there's a thing to press and walk towards your end goal. But don't let it ruin your expectations, because the lack of special movement, shooting and super duper complex free-running is made up for some of the best lines of speech ever.How it runs, Bugs and problemsNo matter what, a potato pc can run this game with topious amount of FPS. It's based on Source, which is light to run, and is based around the Portal 2 build. All the rooms are small, so it doesn't have alot to render anyways.There are no glitches in the game, HOWEVER and this is a spoiler!there is a 'glitch' in the game, which is a gag to demonstrate that you aren't supposed to be there, because he didn't finish the room yet'TL;DRThis is an excellent game, written too well and has a lot of jokes.

The pompous narrator who I much prefer to as an invisible companion gives another dimension to story-telling. As what the title suggest, this is more than a game, it is a parable. Give this game a go. Try to do anything that may seem impossibly strange at first and you will be surprised by the out-come. Don't be tempted to go to Youtube or wikia though to look for solutions. Half of the fun and satisfaction is to play and attempt all the outcomes by yourself."

What is narrative? What makes a game a game? What choices does a player have in a game and how do those choices affect the outcome of the game? Are we fooling ourselves when we think we have control in a game? This ""game"" will have you pondering these sorts of questions with a self-aware wink and a nod. Great voice acting from the narrator and a subversive sense of humor help the overall experience. This is definitely an example of ""video games as art"". Oh, and by the way, I suggest you download and play the demo first because the demo contains content that is not in the full game. It's not like many other demos that simply show you the first level or two. In other words, there is nothing conventional about this ""game""; even with the presentation of the demo."

I'm honestly not quite sure how to describe this game without spoiling anything, but it basically reminds me of Antichamber without the mind bending puzzles and with better narration.  I felt like I was an unwilling partiicpant in the Truman Show, and you can ""beat"" the game in 15 minutes or so, but the true joy and payback in The Stanley Parable is by finding just how you can break the narration and go in different paths.  I think I found over 10 endings, each sillier than the last, and I'm not even sure I've found them all yet.  It's surprising to hear just how pretty much every small thing incites some monologue from the narrator; even the same break room that you walk through a dozen times will trigger new narration each time.  There's no real gameplay here, and honestly it seems to buck trends of the video game industry in a very self-referential way, but unlike some games lower on my list (such as Evoland and DLC quest), the winking is clever enough and has enough substance to say that it feels intelligent rather than pandering.  If you think about much of the structure of this game after the fact, you'll realize that there is a very meta form of commentary on current video game design and player expectation overall.  But even without any of that pretentious jibber-jabber, The Stanley Parable was truly enjoyable for the few hours it held my attention :)"

To put it simply, you'll start each playthrough at a set of two doors, and the narration states that you walk through the left door. You can walk through the left door, or the right. Both lead to very different divergent paths, and from there spiral into even further paths, until you've rather quickly found yourself far from the ""intended"" story.

If you enjoyed reading Douglas Adams, or playing Bureaucracy, I would definitely recommend this. While Bureaucracy laid out a path that, while ridiculous, did lead you to a conclusion, this game calls into question the value of that path while still maintaining the same distanced observationalism that gave me so much pleasure with that game.If you pick this game up, be sure to continue playing, even if it says you beat it! Try all the possibilities - they're equally hilarious. Even performing the same incorrect action numerous times in a row leads to new content. Although, I will say, it's not always a clear line as to when the hilarity ends. For instance, you may find that performing the same action, say, five times in a row has a specific outcome, but the content fails to change after the sixth. That is my only word of warning and, while it did lead me to play out certain paths unnecessarily, it was easy enough to realize that the changes were at an end and to get back on track.I had played this before and had the same impression, but when I saw it on sale, I picked it up again. I thought I had discovered everything already, but I was happy to find that wasn't the case. While you won't be playing this day-in and day-out, it is definitely worth a play-through and a couple follow-ups.Would I have been happy with it at $15? No.. I feel like it's worth that price as a creative work, but at the same time, I may have felt a little ripped off after shelling that out due to the unconventional framing and lack of long-term playability.

The game is infamous, but unless you play it yourself it is hard to figure out or know why. I believe most people are interested in the game because of its already legendary status.It is a curious strange little game, it sure is unique. But is this uniqueness enough to make it a good game? In my opinion it does not. The problem is, that the game is very short and i also don't get the point of it (but, it seems, many other people do). When i started it, i got rather hooked, not knowing where the story was going, how is this going to end, it's all rather mysterious. At some point some story elements somehow reminded me of 'Portal', but before you realise, the game is already over. Another playthough, which could be completely different, was over even faster. No questions ever got answered. So after a few tries i lost interest completely, at most i got a couple of hours worth of 'game' out of it.There are good points too. The game is very humorous, this is mostly due to the narrator and the way he reacts to your actions. All in all, It does a great job creating atmosphere, at least for the first few playthroughs. The graphics are simple but functional and serve their purpose well.This game is not for everybody, if you are interested just because you want to find out what the fuss is about, i would suggest waiting for a really good sale and buying it then.No problems playing this game on SteamOS/Linux, good performance thoughout the game with no slowdowns at any point and fast loading times. Works really well with the Steam controller, ofcourse the game does not require a lot of complicated interactions, so probably any controller would perform well. Streams to Steam Link without issues."

So I did.  The game is fun, I'm glad I played it, but I do wish I had found out a little bit first.It's not just a story game or walking simulator.  It's more of a choose your own adventure.  The downside to this is that a single runthrough can be completed in a pretty short amount of time (5 minutes, 15 minutes, something like that) - then if you want to see another path, you have to replay the game again, encounter many of the same instances, in order to try something new.So while the ending may be different each time you play, there's a lot of repetition.I was expecting a longer single story with different endings that I'd probably play through once.  This game is fine, it's just not what I was expecting, a very short that you are expected to play through multiple times."

Excellent narration and a constantly shifting storyline revealing more and more about the mysterious universe Stanley's is--it just messes with my head and makes me think at the same time.Sure, it may be more of an experience than a game, but come on. Having to restart the game six times while the narrator tries to figure out where the heck he should take you is something you won't find anywhere else.The fact that you never know what to expect is both a bit unnerving, since you never know where the game might take you (reaching the telephone and then my so-called wife was a bit disturbing, to say the least), but it's also where the game shines. It's really a simulated interaction between you and the narrator, whether you chose to follow his actions or not, and so it really feels like you control the story to an extent. Obviously it is a choose your own adventure game, but without uttering a word you and the narrator have this conversation, maybe even altering the narrator or turning him against you.In other words, it's as if you're reading a story to someone but the words keep shifting around, and you're trying to read the story based on the current path it's taking.A bit hard to explain with words. But long story short: try it out. You either love it or hate it."

Trying out different things to see how he'll react is the name of the game & it also determines the endings you get of which there are a lot.The game has no saving feature.  It's not really a game you can beat either.  It's more of a game that you just play.  It's also not really a ""playing"" experience since all you do is move around.  It's more of a ""what's gonna happen if I do this?"" sort of thing.The game is also very short.  I'm not sure I found everything in the game, but I found at least 7 different endings in around 2 hours each of which is unique.

The game's existential and deep questions really make you question reality and the idea of living the same dull life over and over again with no consequence.3. I love the way the game changes as you make different decisions, making every replay from the start funny and interesting, making you wonder if there's another secret to be found hidden somewhere.Cons:1. After playing for a while the game gets pretty boring, as there's nothing left to do but mindlessley repeat the same paths and steps over and over in the hope you'll find something different.2.

After only spending roughly 2 hours with The Stanley Parable I can say it was definitely worth the money.  I overlooked it's initial simplicity once I kept discovering multiple avenues and endings and I took great delight in the wonderful dialogue presented by The Narrator(s?).This game is witty and somewhat slapstick as times which kept me on my toes and laughing the way through.  Though that's not to say it isn't the complete opposite at times. The ambience of environments and surprisingly menacing diallogue from The Narrator served to ratchet up the tension I felt quite a few times. There are certain environments peppered with the sort of humor that anyone familiar with the ""corporate business world"" would enjoy. I feel somewhat hardpressed to call it a ""game"" since all thats required on your part is to walk around and press buttons if you deem it necessary but it's still a joy to play nonetheless.Overall, I think it's worth a try if you're into games that 1) make you laugh, 2) are weird as hell, and 3) are more about making you think or telling you a story rather than giving you some guns and telling you to shoot everything in sight."

It's more of a ""mind-game"" than it is a puzzle game.... in fact, it's really just a story being retold over and over again in a few different ways.Very fun and completely worth the asking price... It won't keep you entertained for an insanely long time but the amount of quirkiness and humor in this game is top-notch and you won't find it anywhere else.The narrator is loveable, fluent and has just the appropriate amount of every quality that will make you fall in love with him. He's very similar to GlaDOS (Portal).8/10, my only complaint is that it doesn't have enough endings and isn't very long of a game."

I've had enough"" after about an hour or so it's the want to find a different path or ending that makes you want to boot up and try again after a while.The gameplay might not be action packed & exciting as ""Half Life 2"" but it's still very entertaining if you're interested in having some non-serious good time fun or if you're a story driven gamer like me.Is it worth buying when you can get it free?While i know this is a Free ""Half Life 2 Modification"" that can be found on""ModDB.com""i think that this game or story, is well worth backing with your money, simply because the developers really tried to make something creative & they succeeded in my opinion.If you're still not convinced then try the free mod before you buy this version, you can get it from here:http://www.moddb.com/mods/the-stanley-parableDo I Recommend This?:Whole heartedly this is a YES i recommend this to anyone who is willing to give something new a go.Other Games Similar You Might Like To Try:If you liked this game then i suggest you give ""Dear Esther"" a look too, it's a Free ""Half Life 2 Modification"" that can be downloaded from here:http://www.moddb.com/mods/dear-estherOr you can buy it off Steam and experience the beauty that it is from here:http://store.steampowered.com/app/203810/"

The story, setting and experience are almost impossible to define with the limited vocabulary of the English language as well as the way the game is always changing for no other reason than to simply take your mind and it's capacity of understanding and going anal with it without using lube.You are told what to do by a narrator, but doing what he says is completely optional and going off to wherever tickles your fancy, and in fact it feels like the game is simply daring you to disobey, making you wonder what to do and where to go. The answer? Wherever you feel like. The narrator will play along with your choices and in some cases will have you sitting in your chair chuckling like a demented chipmunk overdosing on near-apocalyptic laughing gas.There are unfortunate cases where if you want to experience every possible outcome in the game then you'd have to sit patiently by while the narrator blathers on about the exact same subject previously encountered for no other reason than to witness another conclusion before being thrown right back to the start. This I felt was unecessary and made me ultimately wish for a ""skip"" button to pass by the long-winded ""explanations"" (quote-unquote) so I could proceed to the next branch of this massive, tangling jungle of outcomes.For all it's worth, The Stanley Parable, a humble game made on an outdated engine created a memorable, albeit mind-screwing experience ten times better than all these over-the-top generic tacticool FPS tryhard badass games that pollute the market. This is proven by simply standing in a broom closet and doing nothing."

,Recommended,221910,8212162,"Posted: 22 December, 2013",all,UpInFlames,"The Stanley Parable is a first person exploration game. You will play as Stanley and you will not play as Stanley. You will follow a story, you will not follow a story. You will have a choice, you will have no choice. The game will end, the game will never end. Contradiction follows contradiction, the rules of how games should work are broken, then broken again. This world was not made for you to understand.The above is the official description of The Stanley Parable provided by the developers themselves. And this is actually the best description of the game, making all other descriptions redundant. Explaining it further would mean to ruin it. The Stanley Parable is most effective when players know little to nothing about it. But then how do you proceed to write a review for this game? Honestly, I haven’t figured it out yet, so I’ll just keep typing and see what comes out. And if you haven’t played it yet, just stop reading right now and go play it. Seriously. You’re welcome. Oh, and play the demo as well. It’s basically a completely separate game.I suppose the only relevant thing to say about The Stanley Parable is that it’s absolutely brilliant in just about everything it sets out to do. The writing is intelligent in its relentless satire of gaming conventions and the game design complements it impeccably. In fact, The Stanley Parable melds game design and narrative in a way unseen in video games, there is literally no distinction between the two. This is heightened even further by the fantastic voice acting.The Stanley Parable is uncompromisingly witty, modern and relevant. It will react to just about everything you do and you will find yourself second guessing both the game itself and your actions. And just when you think you figured it out, it will turn everything on its head. It’s an irreverent piece of art and social commentary. A revelatory work exposing both game designers and game players. Sort of a gaming equivalent of a Charlie Kaufman film.The Stanley Parable is not only an absolutely brilliant comedy, but a game worthy of study. It may come off as simple, but upon reflection, it makes you contemplate so much. That might be its greatest achievement. It’s a game that will make you think and contemplate not only The Stanley Parable itself, but other games, gaming as a whole and your role in it. It’s basically an elaborate social experiment for gamers.I’m running out of superlatives here. So again, just drop whatever you’re doing and play it. It’s just incredible.9 OUT OF 10 (SUPERB)"

Increasingly repetitive | Suggestion: 5.99 Euro.I did enjoy the Stanley Parable, a game which had more to offer than I initially had expected. When you begin wandering through an abandoned office, exploring the story, searching for that one path leading to the ending that explains it all, you'll soon realise that that's not what it's about at all, but enjoying the cleverness and versatility this game has to offer, following and ignoring commands simply to see what the different consequences will be; Repetitiveness and the frustration of not making any progress certainly are factors to consider, though the developers did well to keep this at a minimum due to the rewarding conclusion of each separate approach, hidden secrets and easter eggs and a fantastic, witty narrator who keep you company all along.The Stanley Parable is a type of game I haven't seem to many of, and though the price may be a little high, it's worth giving it a try."

Just in the first 30-45 minutes of play I was genuinely laughing at the commentary and observations of typical video game tropes and I can't remember the last time a game actually made me laugh.That being said, I don't think the praise was entirely merited; I think the bigger draw to this game is the fact that someone has FINALLY done something interesting, unique and that naturally draws you into playing more through shear enjoyment rather than levels/achievements/leader boards. I do think everyone who enjoys games should give The Stanley Parable a go, not because it's a flawless 10/10, 99 metacritic, GOTY masterpiece, but because The Stanley Parable pulls out a primal, inner child-like curiosity from deep inside you and let's you have a type of fun that somehow feels like an experience we all had lost in gaming long ago.A perfect game?

A game unlike any other, and probably unlike any game to come. If there ever is a game that replicates this one it will most likely be terrible because of the absolutely unique nature of this game.It's funny, charming, sometimes creepy and most of all intriguing. You can sprint to the simplest ending in about 5 minutes, but there is actually about 5 hours of content here. There are so many endings and secrets; even after exploring everything I could possibly think of, the wiki revealed I had still completely missed quite a few.I'm tired of hearing this refereed to as a “non-game” or a “walking simulator.” There are games that could reasonably argued to deserve such a title (Dear Esther, for example) but games like Proteus and The Stanley Parable are defiantly undeserving of this label. Exploration, discovery and the choices you make are far more important then actual mechanics of moving around. And The Stanley Parable in particular actually has distinct narratives you can follow. It's a game.This game isn't for everyone, but it's definitely for me. As long as you know what kind this game ISN'T (puzzle, adventure, shooter etc.) before playing, you'll have a wonderful and memorable experience."

You're going to read this one.Genuinely enjoyable and incredibly witty. I played the free demo (I highly recommend you do this, it's free and perfectly represents the game) beforehand so I knew exactly, sort-of, what I was getting into.This is not a game for everyone. There are no mechanics besides walking, there is nothing to ""do"" but make choices. Sometimes the choices make a difference, sometimes it's just an illusion of choice. They're still yours though, even if your choice is to exit the game and go outside. I choose secrets.Most of the time the narration is just funny, or perhaps informative to Stanley's health and well-being. But there are many moments where I was just like ""Wow. Whoever wrote this is really smart, and actually makes me think about gaming, and game philosophy in different ways.""

The narration is funny when it needs to be, but at the same time when you think about it, the situation in which you find yourself is very creepy and that'll show in some endings (the museum ending, the insane ending and the broken story ending just to name a couple).The only problem I can see is that when you've found all of the endings, what is there to do except replaying the same things over and over again?That's really the only flaw of that game, but because it is a consequence to what makes it amazing, I guess it can't be helped."

He is halfly right, that's why I didn't like YOU harassing him. He is halfly right, BUT from his point of view. He is a very logical and emotional person, who lacks imagination. Imagination is a very crucial thing you have to own to understand the game. You will CERTAINLY feel unfulfilled, if you also lack that kind of imagination this game requires. If you're a ""very logical"" guy, this game is not for you, because you'll never get the true idea of what it has inside, what unlogical logic it hides between the lines of narative text. In conclusion, you can't harass people, who didn't understand the game and found it annoying.

The Stanley Parable was originally released as a Half-Life 2 mod by a small team using mostly Half-Life 2 assets in 2011. The Stanley Parable's gameplay was simple, guide a man named Stanley, who works as employee number 427 in a big company located in a big office building, to one of 7 endings. The paths were pre-defined and, other than that, there wasn't much to do. Regardless, the game was well-received by gamers and critics alike, and while one may consider a game like that soul-rending, those who did indeed play The Stanley Parable enjoyable and savored every moment of it, as though it had been made exactly for them. And everyone was happy.And then one day, the developers of the original mod announced they were remaking it in a more modern Source engine, using more original assets and containing more endings as well as a more fleshed out office for Stanley to explore in.

Oh, look, now its pretending to be an alltogether different game.But all in all, it is just what it is: The Stanley ParableTheres nothing quite like this again on steam, so this is a dangerous affair for your dollars.Lets start by being mean to the game, as seldom people are.I honestly dont think that this is a game as good as the combined review-score puts it, and I honestly dont think its a game that has a large variety of people that would really >get< where the enjoyment lies.What rescues the stanley parable from being a weird outsider in the games playground is its very witty yet completely relateable approach of humor and its coherent way of telling (or not telling, or corrupting) a storyline.That I think is the one reason really everyone could give it a shot if its on sale.With regards to the mechanics: You can walk, you can interact or choose to not interact, that all. Its clean, it works, it has no bugs that I know of, and theres nothing that needs to be added to it, theres no missing part, everything makes sense. The Stanley Parable will be as challenging for you as your mind bends it to be. The biggest mechanic of this game are your own thoughts, and its very controversial to which degree it even could be called a game. This is not a casual buy like its advertised in my opinion, because the fun part happens outside of the screen.In some way you will get exactly of what you dont know you will get.Which absolutely seems like another plus, because buying this game now sounds like poetry.--------------------------------------------------------------------------So the only question that really counts and remains is: Do I recommend it for whatever it is, having played the whole game?It somewhat depends:- If you want it for the fun joyride you maybe have seen elsewhere, I dont recommend buying it except on sale. Not because its bad, but because I think 11,99 is too much for just the fun parts of the dialogue and the running around. You will have seen a fair bit of the game after playing 5 hours. (A more casual comparison to movies of course makes this worth it, but im comparing it to games, ultimately its your call.)- But, and the reason theres ultimately a thumbs up on this review: If you actually aspire to enter the whole brute force of the stanley parable, engage in its problems and think about just what the heck it all could mean. And If you want to explore in the empty office building of the entity named stanley and face the crisis of not knowing whats fake or real anymore, then its the time to stop reading this review right now, butcher your funds and start playing the game.For everyone that has the time and lust to wonder on his hands, this is what you would want to buy."

You cannot break this game. (Okay you CAN but that's somewhat hard to do.) The developers have thought of everything and have considered how you would react as a person, so they've added as much as they could. ""What if I revisit this ending?"" They considered that, too.This seems to be a game with an illusion of choice that's aware of that illusion. Or is it a game? Is it an interactive story? Can it really be a story? A walking sim with soul, really? And what of the narrator? Is he too, just an illusion? You're going to ask yourself a lot of questions. ""What was that I just experienced? I need to do that again. But what if I just go through this door this time?""I kept clicking. I clicked when there was no obvious objective and discovered that was the right way. Or was that the wrong way? The irritation I caused the narrator delighted me, so this seemed like the right way to play to me. Of course until I splattered against the pavement, causing him much horror and sadness because ""I must hate him"" for some reason.What's the downside? Well, it's pretty easy to get the majority of endings in a short amount of time if you're that eager to keep going because you're just that interested. There is a hard ending that will take hours of dedicated game play, but even that becomes simple once you realize that yes, the developers have even thought about ways to obtain that ending. You'll end up resorting to playing just to take a screenshot of every easter egg just to say you found it. Not a horrible thing, but replayability-wise, the game doesn't sink a huge amount of time.That's about it, though. Otherwise, allow me to join those adding their voices to the glowing praise to The Stanley Parable.The break room is truly a work of art.Truly."

In this review, I hope to expose you to all the things that make The Stanley Parable enjoyable to play. You see, the point of reviews isn't quite so much to critique games, as otherwise this would be called a 'critique' of The Stanley Parable. From a purely consumeristic point-of-view, a review is there to give a consumer, ie: you, help for a very simple choice - should I (you) purchase and play this game, or should I let it languish on the store page forever, never to experience the spaces of my computer, so filled with games, and videos of various things (only you, the consumer, know what those things are), and maybe pictures of cats, because those always end up on computers.Generally, the second paragraph is used to extol or castigate the virtues or issues (respectively) that the game contains. This review will focus mostly on the ability of the game to reveal to you the nature of choice in video games while being obvious and not-obvious at the same time, the superb writing, and the multitude of peculiar ways in which the game can reveal your death...or not? You see, that was this review avoiding a spoiler. Very important to do that, in reviews, lest you reveal all the cards in the game's hands before even letting the person play! And wouldn't that be an embarrassment! Yes it would.A concluding paragraph is sometimes, but not always used, to sum up the review. Generally, it's hard to write something that doesn't sound hokey or cliched, with phrases like 'And in conclusion...' or 'It turns out that in the end...'. But in conclusion, it turns out that in the end the Stanley Parable lends itself quite well to a play through, being fun, unique, interesting, and different from anything else that's come before it, is what this review would say. And at the end, it's all about the final sentence, perhaps some pithy pun on the game's name, or some phrase containing the words 'fans of the genre will...'. A well-thought-out final sentence is extremely important to leave a good impression of the review. There's really no avoiding it."

The story and level design are fairly straightforward, but are so well designed that they feel ""right""--such a level of quality in an indie game is both incredibly rare and incredibly beautiful.In addition, the narrator is one of the most multifaceted and complex characters ever written for a video game, and Kevan Brighting's voice acting performance deserves tremendous respect and recognition. He is able to simultaneously convey irony and disdain perfectly, while maintaining a charming and innocently witty demeanor that ultimately hides a very dark nature. He's not just a GLaDOS imitation: the two are subtly different, but if I had to choose, I would say The Stanley Parable's narrator is more memorable, since his manipulations are philosophical in nature and extend not just to the in-game character, but to the player himself.I played the original mod ages ago, and it always pained me how little attention it received, despite being one of the most novel and creative games ever made.

Stanley has his own mind and can decide to take part in actions that will either make the narrator happy or just lead him to downright despair. There are many endings for this game, each are mostly different to the other, and that adds a bit of replayability.This game is almost always self-aware and will not be afraid to break the 4th wall occasionally, and when it happens, you will feel it. The narrator sometimes talks to YOU as the person controlling Stanley, and not Stanley himself.Overall, a must-buy if you love comedy games with a little twist."

While some may write off this game for being an indie title with a smaller budget, I find that the compromises which were made are wholly acceptable. The biggest difference being that instead of having AI companions open all the doors in the game for you, the developers of The Stanley Parable simply could not afford such luxuries and instead introduced the gimmick of ""The Narrator""; whose only purpose is to open the doors for the player, and to announce when he is doing so. One could argue that is quite innovative since instead of cluttering up the screen with arrows pointing the player where to go, in The Stanley Parable every action which the player is expected to act out is audibly announced. This innovative reduction of HUD-clutter leaves much more screen real-estate for more useful information such as XP bonuses and level progression.Sadly, The Stanley Parable cannot keep up with its peers in all facets of game design. Turret sequences are shorter and less numerous than in similar blockbuster titles, and mutliplayer game types include only the standard trite collection of Deathmatch and Capture the Flag. While The Stanley Parable is lacking quite a few features which gamers today expect and take for granted, it does a good job of executing on what it does end up bringing to the table."

We then proceed into mockery of that, a questioning of why it has to be this way, why the player bothers, etc., shown through the game's use of pointless rooms, babies on fire, admittedly humorous commentary, and a nice mind control machine, among other things.My problem lies with the way the game presents its argument. Taking a generic example,The Stanley Parableasks its player to take on x meaningless task. You complete x task, the game then derides you completing x task as it's meaningless and then draws an extension with that to other games. Only, inThe Stanley Parablethat task really is meaningless outside of humor from the narrator (which in itself can be a drive, a reason) whereas in other games x task isn't actually meaningless because I am rewarded with some sort of new experience, such as nice looking visuals, expansion to the story, or an improvement to gameplay. If the narrator inStanleywas, for example, completely boring this game would entirely cease being a game and instead turn into some sort of lecture with game-like elements, given that for something to succeed as a game it must bring enjoyment. Bringing that back to the game's criticism of video games and their development, any action taken by a game's developers is, assuming pure intention, meant to bring enjoyment and towards that effort I think that there should be some responsibility on the part of the player to assume good faith, to at least attempt to enjoy any actions or situations presented by the game developer.Maybe I'm just tired of satire being used every which way; as the Internet's way of identifying intelligence and the source of the fetishism of quips over more long form communication, but nevertheless I really couldn't stand this game's use nor could I handle the innate pretentiousness that dripped through every crack during my playthrough.The Stanley Parable, Stanley is not happy sitting there pushing the same buttons over and over.

In places, it's hilarious, and in others it is far less hilarious than it believes itself to be. But my main concern is not with the content, but with the amount of it for the cost. At £9.99 you're over halfway to getting Portal 2, and I'd suggest you save up. TSP has perhaps one hour of gameplay in it. Then, after looking online to find how to get all available endings, there is perhaps another hour in it. After that, you're left with the achievements that you havent already got, or repeating the exact same narrative as you did before, unless the game decides to randomly change a single thing, which it rarely does.Point is, that for all the relatively edgy play, it is still a VERY finite experience.

The next time they say that I'll just show them ""The Stanley  parable"".The best way i can describe this game, is by saying it's like choose-your-own-adventure-books where you always start at a point in the narrativ and at certain points the narrativ will split into mutiple pathways and you'll have to decide which path you wish to take. The big difference here is that in those books you could see how it's set up, it doesn't feel like you're actually in control of the outcome since you're only able to change the narrativ at certain points, in this game you could make as many decisions as you'd like to (i.e. ""do i want to look at this thingy-majigger?"" or ""hey, there's something written on this paper that won't affect the narrativ but I'm still curious to see what's written on it""). In other words, what I'm trying to say is that all the enviroments in this game are so detailed that you could make as many choices as you would like in an area and when it comes to a decision that affects the narrativ it will feel like those decisions you made before, free and natural.Another thing I need to mention would be the narrativ and dialouge.Throughout the game there will be a voice narrating your decisions... before you make them, defying/obeying the narrativ will lead to new pathways which then leads to new pathways... which eventually leads to an ending depending on the decisions you made.The narrator will respond to your decisions with some of the best writing which has ever been found in a game, heck, half the stuff i did which didn't affect the narrativ, ironically the narrator responded to (broom-closet ending, anybody?), it gives you that feeling that no matter how long you've played it there's still more to discover.The only problem i can see that some people may have is that it's not much of a game, rather a narrativ experience and that some people may not like the humor in the game (even though i don't think i've ever seen a game that made me cry of laughter this much since ""Portal 2"")If you're still not convinced of this game, there's a Half life 2 mod which this game is based on, and it's absolutly for FREEEEEEEEEE!

It may be too short for it's 15 dollar price, but when the Christmas sale comes around, you have NO excuse! This game really makes you think, and I'm glad to have experienced it, even if it was a little overpriced.Don't listen to ANYONE who says this game doesn't have gameplay. It is NOT comparable to Dear Esther or the like, okay? This game is a puzzle of fate. The goal is to find as many different endings as possible- and there are more eastereggs than you can count.It's gameplay is simple and restricted, but you have to understand that the linear nature of the ""story"" is... It's purpose. When the pieces fall into place, you'll understand. You'll have to buy the game and put on your thinking cap in order to understand how brilliant it is. ""You'll laugh, you'll cry"" etc!Don't ever think the ending you get is the last of it, because the ending is NEVER. Don't google how to get all of the endings- find them out for yourself.This game surprises you when you least expect it. Think everything will look and feel the same no matter what path you take?

After playing it all the way through to the end of the demo, I really wanted to purchase it. Though, I didn't have the money for the full $15, so i decided to wait untill i did. A few days later, thrugh the gods of Gaben themselves, it was half price. Going for it, i waited the 7-ish minute wait of installation and instantly played it after wards. I have to say, the multiple endings are great, especially he first one i got.♥♥♥♥♥♥ That, was deep. I didn't even realive there was Achivements untill i found about a third of the endings. I only have to find one more as of typing this. If you like games that mess with mentaly, and like a funny narrator, then try the demo. It's a hell of a ride."

It's fun so long as you enjoy listening to Some British Guy talk at you. I am susceptible to such things and thus was mildly entertained, but I can't say I got a whole lot out of it or that it blew my mind. I found the first 'ending' in 27 minutes, but was intrigued enough to keep looking for other paths for another handful of hours.So this game does get a Yes from me, but conditionally I wouldn't recommend anyone drop more than a dollar or two on it. It's certainly unique, in that I'm having trouble coming up with other games that compare to it. Maybe... errr... Portal 2? But without the Portal Gun? Or any gun? Yes, yes, instead of a gun, you get a whole lot of choices on which paths you walk down. It's also not quite Steve Merchant level of Some British Guy, but it's admittedly still quite good."

This left me to wonder a lot about Stanley and what was going on, and I think this sumarizes the game perfectly. You question many things, and most of these questions are answered. The game revolves around a narrator giving you, Stanley, instructions, and you choosing to obey those instructions or not. Each playthrough takes about 15 minutes, but to complete the game and unlock all the endings, about two hours of play is necessary. Although a narrator is talking to you most of the time, you will not feel like your hand is being held. The narrator begins as a narrator should, talking indirectly: 'Stanley walked through the door on his left', but later talks to Stanley directly, although Stanley never anwsers.The storyline is hilarious, the game looks reasonably good and you will want to find every ending of this game."

He could not discover why he felt this sudden urge to engage in social pleasantries with the masses. He had never been very concerned with this sort of thing before. Perhaps he thought it would move him higher in social standing. Perhaps it would just make him feel more important, as though the decisions of others actually hinged on his advice. Maybe years from now some would reminisce saying, “Do you remember that review Stanley wrote?

I don't want to spoil it but the game constantly throws different lines at you, 18 endings, a great story, and hilarious dialoug. You are allowed to split off of the story. For example, in the first decision, it says to ""Stanley took the door on his left."". However, you don't have to do that. If you take the other, you will have other endings. The game constantly tries to creep you out with new starting areas, a bunch of easter eggs, and even a creepy easter egg that I wont say. -:The people that would like this are people that enjoy confusing gameplay, adventure, branching stories, endings you wouldn't expect, and great dialog.I rate it a 10/10 because of it's genious and near perfection. $15 may seem bad but trust me, it will be worth it. I've played over 10 hours and have still only gotten half of the endings. Play. It. Now.P.S, go to the credits and type in vinh (:"

,Recommended,221910,11444161,"Posted: 27 July, 2014",all,Whorific,"This isn't really a game as much as it is a Choose Your Own Adventure book. The objective is to follow or ignore the narrator to get to one of several endings, with easter eggs hidden along the way and while most, if not all of the endings and secrets are very well made and entertaining, there's really no replay value. You can't do anything besides walking and interacting with a small number of objects. So once you've seen all the endings, easter eggs and interactable objects, there's nothing new to see in future playthroughs. You can beat the game in about ten minutes if you follow the narration. If you're a perfectionist and you want to get through everything, you can stretch out your playtime to about five hours. Well, nine but four of them would be dedicated to getting the art ending which is downright torturous to get so I'd recommend skipping it and just looking it up on the internet.So is The Stanley Parable worth getting? Ehh... Sure. The story is short but good. Most of the alternate endings are great, far more fascinating than the main story. The humor is mostly meta humor but it's done well. There are some very clever moments and quite a few laugh out loud bits. The narrator is just wonderful, one of the best features even. It's just great overall... but, honestly, I'd still recommend waiting for a sale. It's a great experience but again, it's essentially just a Choose Your Own Adventure book and a pretty short one at that."

Can a game with such a charming narrative voice actually make you feel wretchedly depressed?

,Recommended,221910,7754146,"Posted: 25 November, 2013",all,© FuzzDad,"So...I'm in this closet in The Stanley Parable and because I know something about the game and how games are made, I decide not to do anything other than open and close the door a few times. The narrator comes on and over the course of five beautifully narrated minutes of me doing nothing of consequence, I start to have a minor epiphany (the first one I ever had was “The Universe is Big”...that infinity thing blew my 9-year old world-revolves-around-me mind).  Epiphanies come at odd points in our lives and as you remember, I'm in this closet in the game, and I'm realizing the more I devour gaming news and insights into this art form we love (since you’re reading this on Steam you must love gaming so I’m bringing you in as a close friend here), the less an impact it has on me while I play it…or maybe it has a HUGE impact on me. Oh oh…I’ve arrived at a conundrum. Was I bored with doing nothing of consequence or did I really just have a minor life-altering experience in a game that’s maybe not really a game?  You know how reading about movies and seeing endless clips before the movie releases can cause you to be disappointed in the final film?  Maybe I was at that point in The Stanley Parable…I thought I knew what the game was about…but I was having so much fun listening to the narration it was a foregone conclusion I was going to finish the game.I have this sneaking suspicion that’s exactly what the creators of The Stanley Parable want. The “game” is certainly enjoyable at a “they-are-making-fun-of-how-games-work-and-how-we-respond” level. It’s smart, well written, and expertly narrated. But I wonder how that narration goes over in a country where the British accent is omnipresent. Here in the U.S. it sounds wonderful, and part of my enjoyment was the narrator’s inflection, his pacing, and his skill at sounding so, well, so BRITISH…or at least what I as an American, think is “BRITISH”.  Would the game stand up as well with an American accent?  Wheatley in Portal2 stands in the same space (or should I saw is lost in space), but that’s probably because Stephen Merchant can read a line in a dictionary and I’d listen to it with clear joy in my heart. So…I can’t decide if I’m bored with the game or in love with the narration and that’s what I felt the entire time I played The Stanley Parable…bored and in love.I have to say…this feeling was entirely foreign. I’ve never experienced something like this in a game before. It’s not ambivalence, but like my dog Kip does when I say something to him and he’s not sure what the correct response should be, he ♥♥♥♥♥ his head to the side and gives me that LOOK…”I’m interested in what you are saying but I’m not exactly sure why”.  And that’s why I completed the game and that’s why I think you should to. It’s original, it’s strange, it’s…not of this universe we gamers usually inhabit…it makes you think about how we play games.  And I think that’s probably a good thing.NOTE:  Play the game before you read much about it. Finish it up and then do a web search on the many possible endings…you might want to try a few. Technically running this is a breeze on just about ANY PC system out there…it is simple Source level design with some unique programming tricks and easy on resources."

This is not like other games that you have played (unless you played The Beginner's Guide or Dr. Something Something [the name escapes me]).  It's well worth the time to play, but research is highliy recommended, as story paths are not intuitive at all and will take you a lot of time to figure out.  That is part of the fun, though, so only research once you've explored the game in detail, becuase no matter how thoroughly you explored, you missed something."

Each individual playthrough lasts no longer than 30 minutes. This game tells the story of Stanley: an everyman office drone whose mundane existence is interrupted one day when he discovers that all of his coworkers have mysteriously disappeared. As you take control of the protagonist and begin exploring his office building, a snarky British narrator explains each of your decisions before you make them. Before long, you'll realize that you don't need to follow along with the narrator. Only 5 minutes into the game you come to a room with two doors. The narrator says, ""Stanley entered the door on his left."" At this point, your exploration and rebellion instincts may kick, and you'll bolt for the door on your right. Or you could do what the narrator says and stick with the story he wants to tell, and you'll end up with a completely different ending. But with each disobeyed order the narrator becomes increasingly annoyed and unhinged from the game's fragile reality. The narrator is self-aware that this is a video game and that there are limits to what you can do and what he can offer as the story teller. This game will leave you thinking ""what the...""I strongly reccomend it! 10/10!"

The deom wasn't trying to be pretentious with superfluous existential angst. It was....fun. And hey, fun is good!The main game tried to be a bit too clever, felt more hemmed in. You could see where it wanted you to go so that it could play its trump cards, which were in the end, rather annoying and didn't lead to half as many endings as I had hoped.The narrative became full of 'see, I told you so'. I already knew that though, thanks. And I didn't want to try another run through to get that same feeling of 'see, I told you so'.The demo played almost as long as the main game and was just, well, damned funny.

But it shares the humor and mechanics.Which leads me to the main game. It is one of the most brilliant games I played in a long time. It's rather simple made but it is absolutely unique. It's kind of hard to describe a game that is constantly mocking you, itself, games in general and even has a good share of philosophy in it. But most of all, the game is so much fun. I laughed so hard several times and I still haven't tried everything. I can't remember when I last played a game that made so much fun to just try out everything, hoping to uncover something new. I mean, when was the last time in a game I just waited in a room to see if the game comments my waiting?So in short: It's absolutely great, so much fun and very motivating.

Unfortunately,  I have to say that the starting price can be considered a bit harsh in the scheme of things.  I paid around half price and feel ripped off and at the same time.. I feel that it was definitely money well spent.Think of it this way.... This is an amusement park ride.  It may be overpriced... It may be over before you know it... But at the end of the day... You got to ride that bad boy.   Definitely unique and very refreshing.  Wish they would have added about 10,000 times more to it.  I love the idea and if there was a sequel I'd totally pick it up.  Maybe the large price was part of the game design lol.  ""OVERPAY OR UNDERPAY! OR BOTH!""Anyways.. I'd suggest it to anyone who is looking for a short lived yet rewarding experience.  Think of it as paying 10 bucks for you and your kid to go see an Elephant at a local fair or something.  Surely 10 bucks isn't ""worth it"" if you give fun an hourly wage.  But if it's something you wish to experience.. You can't really put a price on the hard work the developers put into this.So again... I overpaid and underpaid at the same time.

It's a relentlessly funny game that actually brought a reflective and self-concious tear to my eye during one of the endings. If you're looking for a game that dissects first person narrative tropes and lampoons a lot of predictable video game archtypes.You want a game where the dev team has thought of literally fraking everything? That's The Stanley Parable, the funniest game I have ever played, and one that made me feel very introspective when all was said and done.8/10, would recommend if you want to go ""haha - oh... wait."""

There's also a very liberal dose of ""lol so random"" content as evidenced by the name of the game's achievements. What sets SP apart (not in a good way) is that while other games I've played used these devices sparingly for getting a few chuckles here and there, SP takes the ideas way too far and makes the entire game simply about pointing out that it is self aware. What I got out of the game is that it's using literary and storytelling devices for pointing out the fact that it's using these devices.As for cleverness, there really isn't that much. All computer games must respond based on the user's input. This one just does so in very peculiar ways (e.g. ""are you doing that just for the achievement?), which falls into the ""lol so random"" territory once more. While I really like that type of humor, it's just not executed well at all, and simply having it does not automatically make the content amusing.Finally, there's certainly an air of hype surrounding this game, which is somewhat funny; because while I couldn't really figure out what kind of parable this game is supposed to be, the parable it does remind me of is The Emperor's New Clothes."

I would have easily payed 60 dollars for a longer version of this game(12-20 hours), but at the sale value of around $4, it feels barely worth it for 2 hours. I felt like there was graspings of a plot, but that they were lost in the many different endings. My favorite part was the narrator, which was the best part of the game, and pretty much made the experience. It's not so much of a game, but an experience. But you have to play it. There's no other way to say it."

The Stanley Parable is a game with many different endings, I belive 17 in total, and it is mostly about makeing choices. When the narrator tells you to go one way, you have choices to go others, branching different paths, in some cases, when you restart from the beggining, something may be off, or the diolog changes after a certain amount of times went in a room (no spoilers). The narrator is allways wanting to go the same direction, and will allways try to get back to the correct path, and Stanley chooses otherwise. Honestly, for an older game, this game still deserves (A rating i've never given before) A solid 10/10, the game even did a nice job with graphics, even though that dosent make a difference in gameplay, its still nice to look at, a great way to spend your time, so do I reccomend it? Of course! Scrape together $15 and buy yourself this game as soon as posible!"

I can't though so I had to give it a negative rating because I feel it leans more that way.ProsExcellent conceptA lot of thought clearly went into this gameLegit funnyExcellent narrationFun for about half an hourConsFun for about half an hourI have a number of issues with the game. I like the idea of trying out and puzzling your way to different endings but there is no sense of accomplishment for finding something new. More achievements would go a long way for this game. A different achievement for each ending would be perfect. As it stands right now you have no idea how far along you are in the game or if you've found everything. This would be fine except the only way to keep going in this game is to keep going back over and over to the same areas to try something new. You may think you have a good idea for something to try but you may have to spend 5 minutes getting to that point (5 minutes doing something you've already done before) just to check it out.An option to skip certain dialogue would be great. Also the ability to have your character sprint would be nice as well. Skipping to certain areas would be wonderful. I understand the developers probably deliberately left these functions out of the game to keep their theme going but it's just too much. I found myself having ideas on things that I'd like to try but couldn't stomach going back and repeating that section of the game all over again just to test out my idea. It turns out speeding up that process somehow, anyhow, is a requirement for my enjoyment.I'll attempt to be vague with this next part as I don't want to give any spoilers. There is a certain area in the game that makes it look like you must have an option for a different ending. They do everything they can to make you feel that way. It has been designed to make it look like a puzzle that can be solved. However, it turns out to be nothing. Without achievements you will never have any idea that this is a dead end. The only way you could ever know that you haven't missed anything is by reading a guide.Anyways, there is too much unrewarding, repetitive backtracking. This seems to be a game designed for acheivement hunters and completionists. Without looking stuff up though you would never know how much of the game you've seen or completed."

There is little story to be had here, and while the idea of the game was sound (having a narrator similar to that of Bastion) it was hugely let down by a game with little mechanics other than listening to someone talk while you go through X or Y door down A or B corridor.Oh and no support for 1080p out of the box, so enjoy having large black borders to your experience or playing in windowed mode - which ruins the experience - especially that of a first person immersive type of game.

Garry's Mod costs only 66% the price (10$) and managed to give me 6,000 times more gameplay (I have 6,000 hours of gameplay on three accounts).

The trailers made the game seem fun and funny.  I did do my research and it seemed like this game would be nice change in pace from the usual games.  It was different, but it was also horrible.  The demo was honestly more exciting and fun then the game itself.  I would personally recommend playing the demo and then being done with the stanley Parable.  To give you an idea my favorite part of this game was a broom closet.  I will not post any spoilers as I do not want to....well there is nothing to really spoil, but I do not want to spoil any of the minor details incase you want to experience them yourself.WHAT DO YOU DO:This game feels like a 5 year old came up with a story line.  Your Stanley and you are left in an office building all alone.  Your only guide is the narrator and you can either do what he says or not.  It really does not matter what you choose to do because in about 5 minute you will experience some boring walking around, hear a few comments from the narrator, and then the game will end and you will restart....and then restart again and again and again.Nothing in this game ever gets explained, there is really no story.  You just walk around an empty office building and can not interact with anything in it (you can click and ""push buttons"" but they never really do anything amazing).  You can not even jump.AN EXAMPLE STORY LINE:Now I do not want to give to much away incase you choose to play this game. SO I WILL NOT post any details.In one ending of the story you walk around the office building doing the opposite of what the narrator tells you to do.  Then eventually you reach a room where you have to litterally sit there and press a button for 4 hours, litterally 4 hours, then the game says good job and then....restarts. (I watched a youtube videos of this one as I felt that sitting for 4 hours to push a button was an extreme waste of time, I have better things to do)There are 17 paths similar to this ending.  One of these paths ends with the game saying the only way to win is to quit and not to play again.  After that the screen stays black forever...then imagine that you have to restart the game.WHAT I LIKED:There is a broom closet in the game.  one of the few items you can interact with and that actually does something.  You open the door to enter this closet (which is amazing as you can not open most doors).  You step in and out making the narrator say funny things.  But then eventually the narrator gets bored of this and your in a tiny room with nothing to do.Conclusion:In conclusion, this game had potential but if feels incomplete and lacking of any real content.  The choices you make don't matter at all as they will be forgotten in about 5 minutes, jumping off high places to die don't mean anything as you will just restart.  Some people may like this game, and that is fine, but I found this game to be tedious and boring.  In 3 hours I have experienced every ending except pushing a button for 4 hours as that seemed way to boring so I just watched a 7 minute youtube video of that ending.  In fact if your at all curious about this game just go to youtube and watch one ending/play threws and you will know what this game is.  Then you can make an informed decision about buying this game or not.  This is one of the rare games where you should watch a play threw as it will not ruin the rest of the story/game for you and you can see what the game is like.STEAM GAME TIME:In case you care, (I have a feeling some people will bash/try to disprove this review because I have a dislike opinion) Steam says I have more then 3 hours of game play because my wife needed my help and I left the game running on accident.  Now before you say oh this dates you and thats why you did not like it.  I am 25 and have been gaming since arcades and the Nintendo NES.  So thats the story about as interesting as The Stanley Parable.  In fact I just wrote a new story line for the stanley parable now my gaming life can be a path you can choose...and then the game restarts....and no one cares or even remembers what happened here today.ANYWAY thank you for reading my review, I hope it helps you make a more informed decision.  Have a great day and I hope your gaming goes well."

However, like many other folks who have left negative reviews, I thought the game had too little content to be worth the asking price. I completed most of the endings after an hour and a half, read about the few I missed online, noticed a few easter eggs along the way, and after two/three hours I was done.

It's core gameplay involves making choices and the hilarious outcomes that result. It has you searching for opportunities and taking new paths as they arise. However, this is the problem. The game is too dang similar every time you play. No matter which ending you take, you end up going down the same path every single time. It gets to the point where you just rush through and ignore all the dialogue, just so you can hear a new line of dialogue. It becomes a chore to play.The Stanley Parable does have some good parts to it. The narrator is often humorous and witty, and his lines are funny. Some of the endings are very creative, such as the portal and minecraft ending. The game has little easter eggs here and there. In many situations the narrator will react to stanely just sitting around or clicking on everything and comment on it.At the same time, The Stanley Parable just doesn't come through. Some of the endings are too bland. Hearing the same lines of dialogue, making the same choices, going down the same path, following it, keep going, just to take a left turn right before the end instead of going straight; is it really worth it? No. It isn't. This is the big problem. The game is so repetetive and boring. You WANT to find all the endings, to find all the random differences, but to have to go through it all again just to attempt to find somethin new is too much. I couldn't force myself to do it. It was fun for a bit but it got old fast. This brings me to my one big complaint: the price. Why are they charging 20 bucks for this game for such little content? Seriously, this game deserves to be 15 TOPS. Why buy this game when you could get Garry's mod for you and a friend? I bought this game on sale, but really, I feel bad for people who paid 20 dollars for 4 hours max of legitimate gameplay.TL;DRThis game is fun at first, but the lack of variety just kills the game.

Also you might need to take a look at any possibly abusive relationships you might previously or currently be in, but that's really your business, not mine.The odd thing about this game is that the ""best"" (IE happiest) ending is by far the easiest and quickest to obtain; you just do as the narrator commands you to and it will be over in about five minutes.The FUN (and entire point of the game) comes from looking for all the different ways you can subvert that narrative and spite the narrator, to go off-course and be scolded for it.  Essentially, you get to let out the defiant child in all of us, who does things they know they aren't supposed to do just to get a reaction out of their authority figures.Yes, the game is incredibly short (You can experience 100% of the sights, dialogue, and secrets in about 3 hours), but it's an experience you won't regret; think of it like a gourmet chocolate bar.

Well, I found the story to be lame, and the gameplay to be even more lame.  Having someone do decent narration does not equal a good game.  Recommend getting Bastion or The Bard's Tale where the story is better, the gameplay is a thing, and you won't feel like you've been robbed of your money and however little time the game takes to bore/anger you into not playing it anymore."

You walk down the hall, all the other cubicles are empty. There is a Narrator doing the narration thing, talking about how you’re looking around and don’t see anyone, and thus you decide to go to the meeting room just in case everyone is there. But you didn’t decide that, as a player. The Narrator simply provided a context for why you would continue down the hall. You reach a set of doors you must choose between. The Narrator informs you that the left one goes to the meeting room, and it’s obviously the one you will take. The one to the right isn’t important.Which one do you choose? Why do you choose it? Let’s see what happens when you do pick one and follow through.This simple opening to The Stanley Parable is the heart of the game. It’s all about the choices you make, but that’s a gross oversimplification. It’s difficult to talk about the game without spoiling anything, since most of what makes the Stanley Parable a parable, lay in your own interactions with it. You’ll come across many choices. The Narrator will talk about a great many things. Like a complex movie with many plot threads, the Stanley Parable needs to be replayed several times for full effect."

The Stanley Parable is a ""choose-you-own-adventure"" with a Portal style narrator. It has a message about the symbiotic dichotomy between the storyteller and the players, and how both can cooperate or frustrate each other in their own special ways. It is what I would call ""hard core"" indie, and legitimately pushes the boundaries of what you would consider a game, an accolade that is often heaped upon lesser entrants to the genre.I can't resist coming back to ""30 flights of loving"", or anything from ""Tale of Tales"", abysmal failures of pretentious indie storytelling, but which are sometimes praised by people who like subtitled films simply because they're subtitled. Is Stanley Parable worth the price tag? I cannot answer that for you, but you absolutely should try the DEMO, which is free, meaty, and a completely novel experience discrete from the game proper - and which is orders of magnitude better than 30 flights."

Other times, it makes you want to pull your hair out.The true test of this game lies in the simple premise: How far are you willing to go against your own judgement and emotions in order to simply experience more gameplay? Depending on how much you trust the omnipresent narrator and what experiences you bring with you, this game can be a hilarious ride through Inception or a emotionally-scarring trip through hell. The narrator is always trying to lead you to a happy and conclusive story, but unfortunately, the narrator's plans and the game's plans are completely opposite unless you obey his every word.If you enjoyed the demo, you might not enjoy this game. This game has a much darker and 'sadder', per se, tone than the demo, which is mostly silly and fun.If you crave deep and thoughtful experiences, this is the game for you. It will draw you into its world and show you just how easy it is to toy with someone's emotions.

I normally do a the good, the bad, and the ugly style of review, but with The Stanley Parable it's hard to do that without spoiling things. I will end with this though, expect to both play a game and a meta game at the same time when you play The Stanley Parable. Meaning most games are about the ending and not the journey. The stanley Parable is about the journey. Explore! Scratch that urge to check every nook and cranny. Try everything you can and don't go straight to a guide to tell you everything until you've played it for a while. Half the fun of the game is exploring and if you read a guide you kill that part of it."

,Recommended,221910,7418220,"Posted: 18 October, 2013",all,Ens. M.,"I begrudgingly admit that I actually liked this remake. Enhanced Edition. Whatever you'd like to call it. However it's not for the writing. It's just so eager to be meta and to hit you over the head with it that it becomes dull. The humor felt to me like it tried too hard to go for something like Douglas Adams that it was embarrassing at times. That's not to say that I didn't chuckle a few times. Some of the endings just dragged on too long. And while The Stanley Parable certainly has points to make, most of them were either nothing new to me, lost me halfway, or went into one ear and out through the other because I was too busy admiring the level design (additionally to just not being able to be arsed). Still, it didn't feel as smug as the demo did, which takes the prize home in that category. It also felt less obnoxious than the mod for a reason I cannot really explain since there's a lot of overlap between them. Perhaps it's because I thought the level and environmental design was really, really good, and balanced out my dislike of what I found to be negative aspects.A lot of effort has gone into both of those aspects, and plenty of times they actually interact rather cleverly with the narration I must say. Going by looks, The Stanley Parable is the slick, technical opposite to Dear Esther's beautiful, natural island. On top of that, the game is full with little entertaining secrets which, while meta, didn't annoy me as much as I thought they would. Maybe because I have never seen a game utilize them like this. I think these points are what made me warm up to it eventually.To cut a long story short: it's a slick looking and neatly presented choose-your-own-adventure game with a focus on being meta and it's head stuck slightly up its own♥♥♥♥♥ In lieu of it's length of about +/- 3 hours 10 bucks is a bit much in my opinion, wait until it's on sale for either 7.50 or 5.

'Wait!' he thought, 'If I write without playing the game first, then my review will be no better than those lies. How will I know how linear the game without playing it? After all, linearity directly corresponds to quality, everyone in the office knows that.' He quickly bought and played The Stanley Parable. Finishing late into the night he collapsed back into his chair. 'Wow,' Stanley thought emotionally, 'My initial opinion was so wrong in every way.'

Well, not in the traditional sense, anyway - it does not have a progression system, nor does it have true 'puzzles', nor does it truly engage the player in any sort of 'gaming' way.  Rather, it is more of an interactive experience - you play through the game in approximately 10-20 minutes, achieve one of the many endings based upon the choices you made while playing, and then the game starts you back at the start to begin again.If you enjoy games that explore the meanings of things like narrative structure, or the significance of player choices, you'll like this game.  If you can't stand games that don't actually have any real gameplay to them, you won't like this game.  If you're considering it - even just toying with the thought of it in your mind - there's a free demo available for the game.  This demo is NOT just a reduced version of the full game, and is certainly worth a look.However, is it really worth your money?  $15 is a little steep - I enjoyed what I got out of it, but there's no more than 10 hours to glean from this game, and that's being rather generous.  I'd recommend that you wait for the game to go on sale before purchasing, but if you can't stand not playing The Stanley Parable for another second, purchase it by all means - you could certainly do with worse.Overall?

Narration and exploration are absolutely amazing and are pinnacles of this game. It is unfortunate that the game must inevitably be compared to the mod it spawned from because, while both are excellent, they are excellent in different ways. The remake has more to it and is definitely more fleshed out and better realized but there's one ending in the mod that felt stronger and more poignant to the point where I felt it was the best ending of the game and was ultimately the most satisfying. While that ending didn't do much for me other than a huge nerd moment where I gushed to myself over the development of the game, the rest of the game was infinitely more interesting with the change of the truly subversive ending turning into an ending about game design in general.

Every action you can make has been accounted for and lead to different stories. You're given instructions but you don't have to follow them, although I reccomend you do so on the first playthrough. Each run only takes a few minutes but there are enough options to make it worth the price.Throughout the whole game you have a passive-aggressive narrator that becomes increasingly flustered as you go further off the rails. His lines are great and his delivery pushes them into gut-bustingly halarious territory.If you want something that will make you laugh and think, try this."

This game should be celebrated for its criticism of how we currently design and play our games, and for challenging the conventional definitions of what we consider to be a ""game"" in the first place.

It does end, repeatedly, only to start again. Occassionally 'complete' the game (though never sure if you have, or if it's a poor joke), only to have it start again. And again. Look up a guide to see if there's something you're missing, discover that there isn't.There are several ways to 'complete' the game, but they're all very unsatisfying and do not forward the story. I guess there is no story. Played for less than two hours and found most of the endings. The ones that I missed I don't care about. Feel ripped off, even though I only paid £2, when on sale. Feels like a mini-game that should have been bundled with a proper game (like Portal was, but that was a great game). The game designers are trying too hard to make something 'different', which it is. But games like this aren't made for a reason. Wandering the same office over and over is not fun.Don't bother.

Tuttavia, sono rimasto assai deluso: questo gioco è poco più di una perdita di tempo.Personalmente credo che un forte peso nella valutazione di un gioco debba essere tributato al senso di ""costruire qualcosa"", che può essere farmare, superare livelli o risolvere enigmi.In questo titolo non ho trovato nulla di tutto ciò, l'unica cosa che lo rende vario è il fatto che sia possibile scegliere A o B, e gustarsi le reazioni (raramente) satiriche del narratore. Che poi, diciamolo una volta per tutte, titoli che fanno satira sul grigiore degli impiegati nei ""tempi moderni"" si hanno dal tempo di ""Hard Times"" di Dickens, quindi non credo che si possa dire qualcosa di davvero ""profondo"" in più di quanto non sia stato già detto.L'unica cosa che mi sento davvero di segnalare per la positività è la ricercatezza di certi interventi: perlomeno gli sviluppatori si sono impegnati(incredibile, visto il risultato).In definitiva, mi stupisco davvero come questo gioco sia riuscito ad ottenere una valutazione ""molto positiva"" dalla comunità. Sicuramente è carino, per i primi 5 minuti. Dopodiché, se avete scelto di giocare per svagarvi un po', la consapevolezza che state buttando il vostro tempo vi assalirà, portando più frustrazione di quella che già porta un gioco in cui non si ha un vero obbiettivo.Se dovete comprarlo(incoraggiando così i produttori di giochi così scarsi), aspettate che sia in saldo: sarebbero 12 euro davvero buttati."

The actually storyline to the game changes everytime your select a different option but the part that stays the same is the fact that one day Stanely gets out of his office and everybody is missing. You go through the building as a narrator talks over you and says what you are about to do, like a story. It is a game of options, you can choose to go along with the narrator and see where that takes you or the exact oposite. It is a very creative game with a lot of funny moments. The only bad part about this game is after I was able to finish all the of the alternative endings, (Besides the one where you sit there for 4 hours pressing a button to save a baby) I have only came out with 2-3 hours of gameplay which I wouldn't consider worth 15 bucks. It does feel like there was a lot to the game at the same time and felt like I played it for a good amount of time but numbers don't lie. So if you have money just laying around and looking for a random awesome game I highly recommend this game 9.5/10 but if you don't have that money just laying around or you are wanting the most hours for your buck this game isn't the game for you, 4/10PS: I got this game during a sale for only 2 dollars so if it is for sale for a good price GO FOR IT!"

Where it really fails for me is that it simply does not have enough interaction, or random events and triggers. This leaves you wandering through the level attempting to activate objects that don't produce response, or respond in a very mundane or boaring way. Excepton being eventually one always doesn't; which you would think would be good, but instead just leaves you feelig obligated to the task of clicking on all the mundane boaring things.This game strikes to close a similarity to a real job."

I played the original mod lots and then bought this when it was released as its own entity on Steam. This game is the less of a ""game"" and more of an interactive story or ""walking sim"".It's incredibly funny, really absurd, got lots of depth, makes you think, and keeps you really engaged. These qualities are the overarching reason why so many absolutely love The Stanley Parable. The narratror is great and the sound quality is fantastic. This game made me think a lot about myself and my existence, while at the same time it also made me laugh so hard I almost crapped my pants.Simply put, The Stanley Parable (like other games such as Shadow of the Colossus, Journey, ABZU, Antichamber, etc.) bridge the gap between video games and other fine art forms like books and theater and art. You will not regret this game if you buy it. You will never forget your original feelings and experiences of playing it. It's a cult classic.As an added bonus, there's also some really silly and weird achievements to get which make you think outside the box and boost the replayability of this game (which is probably its weakest attribute)."

,Recommended,221910,14642473,"Posted: 24 February, 2015",all,EnobyDarknessDementiaRavenWay,"The Stanley Parable is the worst open-world sandbox I have ever played. I was hoping, upon starting the game for the first time, that I would be given a space to explore that is so large that it takes upwards of an hour to get to my next objective, but the Stanley Parable is too busy entertaining me to give me a massive wasteland to explore. (0/10)The Stanley Parable is a horrible action game, because it's gameplay lacks complexity. With an abscence of enemies comes an absence of action, of tension, and investment in the plot. It's also worth noting that the afforementioned plot is totally nonsensical, and the devs found it more important to create their own artistic vision than to appeal to the tastes of myself, and no one else. (10/0)The Stanley Parable is the best Stanley Parable game that The Stanley Parable has made so far. The amount of Stanley is STAGGERING this time around, and the Parables at the players fingertips are all unique in their own ways, and they preach valuable lessons that any aspiring Stanley could find beneficial to their own Parables.  (97.9999994/10)I bought the Stanley Parable for $20, and was incredibly upset at how short it was, even with it's large amount of endings and easter eggs to hunt for. I reached 100% completion after a mere 2 and a half hours. Haven't the Galactic Cafe heard of the proper 'amount paid to hours of gameplay' ratio? For every dollar, a game must provide .683445 hours of content in order to be considered 'worth a purchase'. With what I paid for, I should've gotten 13.6689 hours of engagement for what I paid. It would be best to buy it on a sale for the correct price: 2 dollars and 5 cents American. (1 euro/70 euros)The Stanley Parable is an incredibly well made novelty, which is unfortunatley not very long, and some may find the lessons lying within it's subtext to be too obvious. Also, the Galactic Cafe didn't pay us to advertise the game on our horrendously designed website, so my corporate overlords have dictated that we rate it less than the latest installment of the Call of Duty franchise, which has single-handedly kept our site financially up and running since 2008. (8/10)The protaganist isn't a woman. (-5/Woman)Since completing The Stanley Parable, I've been able to install several mods, and have added killstreaks, dialogue trees, an inventory screen, and I've exchanged the game's soundtrack with the Transistor Soundtrack. (Best Game Ever/10)I feel a need to rate this game badly, because it didn't deliver on the promises made in it's trailer: Never at any point was I able to have the infinite freedom the british man promised me, and there isn't even a single bicycle in the game. Guess I'll have to go back to the limitless freedom of Skyrim, where I can ♥♥♥♥ the shopkeepers wife in plain view and no one will care. Skyrim: (8/8) Starable: (2/Skyrim)I hate this game because I can't convey all the little touches that make it interesting and valuable, because people don't have enough time to read an ENTIRE review, and people would rather put faith in the notion that some random ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ on the internet will enjoy a game in exactly the same ways they do.(Thegameisallatoncefunny,insightful,andthought-provoking/10)"

In this remake the environments are bright and crisp, the narrator has more spring in his step, there's more biting commentary on The Deplorable Current State Of The Games Industry And Community, and the content is much wackier all-around. None of this stops the game from being very spooky. You wait for jump scares that never come. Myst used to freak me out the same way. I had a blast playing this. I saw everything I could find on my own and then immediately looked online to see what I missed. It blew my mind at least half a dozen times, and I giggled constantly throughout. The narrator's script and performance are dead perfect, whether passive-aggressive and smarmy, hostile, friendly or pathetic.For a game that argues there's no meaningful ""freedom"" in the branching pathways of many plot-driven games, it's awfully satisfying to disobey the narrator. It reminded me of a Sesame Street book I had as a kid, ""The Monster At The End Of This Book."" Anyone remember that one? A classic! But I digress. The makers of TSP have spotted the what's unsatisfying about a morality system: you can be idealistic (always with the knowledge that success is possible of course) or willfully transgressive, and there may be other choices, but you can never truly dream up your own solution to a problem. Games that pretend to be about the player are almost always not. In TSP, any combination of obeying and disobeying has been accounted for by the game makers, and leads to its own completely linear route. Try to cheat and you'll find they've prepared for that eventuality too. The uniqueness of your experience is only a question of how much content you uncover, and in what order.A few minor quibbles:-My very first ending was the attractive Portal-esque ""escape"" option that led to the ""museum"" that showcases assets from the other endings. Partly my fault, sure, but still, spoilers much?-The always-obey path is probably the best for a first round but it's too immediately attractive to go off the rails and many players will wander into one of the ""broken game"" routes without fully appreciating it.-A tad disappointed to see Stanley's model on a couple occasions, as it looks much worse than the rest of the graphics. Same with the ""outside"" landscape seen in one ending, definitely not up to snuff."

The only bit that was even slightly amusing was the the broom closet being boarded up in later run-throughs. I refuse to use the word ""playthrough"" for this title because the word ""play"" implies it was fun. It wasn't.  I'd give it 1/10 and that's ONLY because the narrator is clearly an accomplished voice actor.

76561198004585919,Recommended,221910,29972576,Posted: 16 February,all,sircrimsonfox,"As crazy as any game you will purchase. You have no doubt heard the hype about this game. For this game is nothing but hype. Why? People say ""play this game"". ""Why?"" you respond. ""I can't tell you. Just play it."" I'm sure you've had that conversation. The reason people want you to play it is that the game is very very funny and to tell you anything about it would spoil the comedy. So rather than say specific things about it I'll just loosely describe it. Firstly it isn't a game yet it uses a game engine...the source engine from Half Life 2 to be exact. This game followed on the heels of Portal 2 and it pretty much owes that game for its popularity as well as its sarcastic and passive aggressive sense of humor. I guess calling this a cross between an adventure game and a digital interactive novel would be the best fit. You have a character and you wander around in this game world. You can click on things. The point is not what you can accomplish, the point is to enjoy the story...or rather the attempts to get to the story. There are many many games now, mostly in the anime game world that exist just as stories where you make choices and the main point is to enjoy the story and especially to experience all the different endings you can. Things like Hatoful Boyfriend and Long LIve the Queen, and a little bit of the Skauras and things like that. Not much game but choices you make in the narrative affect what story path you take. Well THIS is kind of the opposite. You don't make choices in the narrative. YOu make choices in the game world by your actions and the narrative follows you. However, the narrator is not always keen on the choices you make. So as far as the gameplay goes, if you like roaming around in a portal worldthen sure you'll be okay with that part of it. I do feelit gets a bit resource hoggy and the frequent loadscreens at times just kinda take over until they are finished. The story here is less of the point. This is a comedy game. And you willdefinitely see several points where you are laughing your hiney off. One thing that should be said is that yes you should keep playing and peel away every little shell of this game. It is not very clear of the amount of content that is here and you may think that when you get to the end ...and go....""That's it??"" Well that's not it. There's a lot here. Now aside from the comedy there lies another layer beyond that will go over many people's heads. This is quite an existential philosophy game. It is a satire. It is social commentary about gaming and gamers as a whole. IT is a spoof or parody of adventure and action games. Yet it IS one itself. Like the movie Scream was a parody and commentary of horror movies while being one itself. LIke Shakespeare in Love told the tale of Shakepeare writing plays while having a complete structure of a shakepeare play. That's the genius of this game. If you are looking for an actual STORY. Well there really isn't one. If you're looking for an actual game....well there really ISN'T one of those either. But this is definitely worth experiencing on the level of binging your favorite comedy series on netflix. The replayability however...well you can put it down and pick it up in a few years once you've forgotten some of it. But there isn't much. YOu can try the achievements which are equially satirical of achievements. The game basically boils down to ""Find all of the game"" and enjoy every bit of it. Does that justify the price? Not one iota. I've never liked interactive novels , whatever they are called having prices over 10 dollars. They usually aren't worth more than 5. Sales didn't really take this down to what it should have been priced. However...like I said with the Portal and Source names behind it and following after those...it had its acceptable pricetag. Now however, you'd think they would have lowered the price. There just isn't enough content to justify it. Just very very little replayability. Would you pay netflix 15 dollars to binge watch one season of one show? That's the equivalent here. Still it's very funny and worth experiencing on sale."

I can only recommend this game on sale as I believe 15 bucks is too much for what this game offers."
,Recommended,221910,29290084,Posted: 15 January,all,TheBlakDrag0n,"Honestly, I got this game because I thought the video on the store page that the designers made regarding the ""whiny"" customer feedback was hilarious!  Mostly because it struck home for me as a novice game programmer.  I've played this game through as many endings as I can find and I've enjoyed every quirky moment of it.  The narration can be quite humorous when you don't do as the narrator instructs.Spoiler:This game will be even funnier to you if you've played other games like Portal, Half-Life 2, or Mine Craft."

So, there’s a good idea behind this game. Another question would be if it’s right to call Stanley Parable a game at all because of it’s simple nature. It’s dressed as a game but really it’s more of a walking simulator. The great idea behind Stanley Parable is the narrator who comments on everything you do, even on some small random details. The comments are really funny, you will get to laugh a lot. Also, you get to choose paths so there’s a great replay value. The unlocking of achievements is also embedded to the narration so I highly recommend pursuing them.  It can take you less than 5 minutes to complete the game but in my case I put 1,5 hours into it without repeating anything I previously did.Verdict: I don’t know weather to call Stanley Parable a game but it will be a time well spent."

A lot of the humour and playability comes from trying to out-think the developers and drop yourself into situations you hope they haven't anticipated and programmed for. You'd almost certainly be wrong, but it's fun finding out. I don't want to say too much for fear of spoiling the surprises, but I will say this:The Stanley Parable is also (I think) a study into gaming itself as a medium - for example, the most direct path (the ""Freedom"" ending) where Stanley breaks free from the shackles he's been living in, can only come about if you do exactly what you're told at all times. Wow.Much as with ""Thomas Was Alone"", much of the charm comes from the brilliant narration by Kevan Brighting, who has apparently since the game been snowed under with requests and job offers. Good.Whether or not you have played the full game, the demo is well worth a play as it doesn't [mostly] reuse any scenes or situations from the full game and includes plenty of new narration..."

I played it back when it was a free Half-Life 2 mod, but this version is much more refined (though a small slice of the mod sneaks into one of the endings!). It's quite short and cerebral with essentially zero action; gameplay basically consists of ""walk around, listen to the narrator, make choices"". If you're the kind of person who doesn't like short or slow-paced games it might not be worth the full $15, but for the enjoyment I personally got out of it, I actually regret buying it on sale because I'd rather have given the developers more money.Anyway, I loved this game.

Once you've reached the end you'll probably move on. However, I give it a thumbs up because the developers managed to achieve a decent atmosphere, which is a little unnerving and almost claustrophobic at times.

The narrator tells you what Stanley does and what he encounters. You can choose to disobey him, follow the story, or anything in between. The game has 15 or so endings, which depend on what you choose to do. It is kind of like a choose your own adventure story, but with a narrator that you can disregard if you want.It's hilarious and witty, and the guy doing the voice of the narrator is extremely talented and funny. The game is essentially one big experiement with storytelling that aims to explore the ideas of free will and narrator vs. character. The game is a big mind game with trippy implications. I won't spoil it for you. Just go play it if you're interested in how storytelling works or if you just want to laugh.For people who playd the mod: the difference between this and the original mod is huge. Almost 4x the endings, tons more choices, and many lines of dialouge."

I will preface this with saying I really, really wanted to like The Stanley Parable.  I did not play the original incarnation of this game (which as I understand it, was simply a HL2 mod a la the original Gary's Mod).  I bought this game when I was looking for something new and fresh to kill the better part of a day with.  I played the demo and was sold by the sense of humor and mystery.  I bought the game shortly thereafter, grabbed a beer and got comfortable for what I was certain would be a great adventure.It definitely started out that way, but as time went on I was less and less enthused by the game and more annoyed.  The problem, you see, was that I was expecting some mystery and adventure which ultimately unraveled into a good story with some twists and explanations.  Instead, all I experienced was seemingly random mystery and ""adventure"" with absolutely no story beyond the very superficial ""isn't this quirky and weird!?"".  After a couple of hours (or more?) of running through this maze-ish game, and after running into a couple of repeat scenarios and dialogue, all I could think was ""this cannot possibly be all there is to this game.""I really hate to even say this, but this is the first game on Steam that made me google Steam's refund policy.  I've never felt so misled by a game before.  It is very possible that this is my fault (if there is anyone at fault) in not doing my due diligence, but I genuinely felt misled.

It takes less than 2 hours to complete every ending and has no replay value. It just goes to show, when something is given the title of ""art"", the actual content becomes irrelevant.

I went through the entire game and every possible outcome only 90 mins into the game, without even speed rushing or trying to go fast. To give you a reference, this game is about 1/4 as long as the first Portal game. There is even an achievement you can unlock for speed rushing one of the multiple endings in under 4 mins and 22 secs. REALLY? 4 MINS TO BEAT THE GAME?!?! I know there's multiple endings, but jesus christ. I'm not trying to bash this game, I thought it was amazing to be frank. I just feel the $15 I paid didn't live up to its expectations, this is also the type of game where once you did all outcomes it just won't be the same going through the game again because there's no puzzle solving, objectives or things to do. Well like I said, I played this game for about 90 mins and I'm pretty damn sure I did every outcome and after about the 4th or 5th time going back it gets to the point of being more of a job rather than a game. The only thing good about this game is the narrator's voice and how he pronounces Stanley's name. To be honest I'm actually glad it's over, it's so repetitive and annoying it practically has a lenny face written all over it. They should call it ""The ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) Parable""."

It is like us listening to commands like Stanley and just keep walking. Then if you feel rebellious and do something else which leads you ending which isnt the best. Eventually it becomes a contradiction, you are stanley who always follow command and the best solution is to follow command but the start of the game, if you chose to leave the room, it means you have the heart not to follow commands.Perhaps it won't feel that bad to me if there are some explanation like scene where there are multiple tv, why are there errors for some, why are some fired, or where are the rest, who is this boss, why is he doing this.

Yes... there can be other routes, additional content, extras, easter eggs, etc. But there should be a clear main purpose for the game. A goal to reach and this software doesn't have it.Instead of a game, what you get here is an experience in which you actually become the main character of this game, Stanley. I mean, when you're running around trying to trick a narrator without no purpose at all, is there really a point to continue ""playing""? You're just like Stanley, pressing keys into a keyboard because that's what they're telling you to do it, directly or indirectly, with no consequence and no purpose.Seriously, if you want to see what this game has to offer, just go and watch a video showing the different endings.

There are times when the game can be genuinely funny, but for the most part, you'll be sitting through the experience (and I use that term lightly) with a straight face. The game is structured around giving you different choices throughout the plot (another term I use lightly) that will drastically change the story depending on what you do, but none of these choices actually feels satisfying and although that's sort of the entire point of the game, it's not worth paying $15 for.

There is a rather poor level of subtlety put into hiding the main gimmick, so people who analyze what's going on and see through the methodology right away will probably have a much more passive experience, where people who view the idea as novel or unexpected will probably have a good time throughout.Now all that said, no matter what this game is definately worth an experience, there are a handful of really great bits of narrative, and it's worth your time just for that, but as an overall game/experience, it's not something you can expect to come back to, except maybe to show a friend a funny part or something.Basically it's shallow and inconsistent, but the idea, presentation and voice acting carries it through, and the good bits are definately good."

I tried the Stanley Parable demo. I loved Portal and other thinking man's games. I knew this was not a 'game' as much as it is a strange tacking together of exploring to find weird outcomes. I just didnt find it all that interesting.There is an excellent narration! Cheeky britishness that some would call humour is littered throughout the game. Unfortunately I didn't find it quite as entertaining as The Office. However, if you don't like rereading (turn to page 7 to fight the dragon or turn to page 16 to run away) create your own story novels then you will probably be bored with this 'videogame as art' after a couple of hours.I am glad that this was made and I can see how some will appreciate it. I appreciate when a game is created that tries to avoid being more of the same ol crap. I just wish i paid 2.49 and not 12. I will try it a couple more hours to see what else I can shake out of Stanley... Then uninstall.imho.. It's a lot of hype.

,Not Recommended,221910,13872132,"Posted: 6 January, 2015",all,Nyronus,"The Stanley Parable an oft vaunted game that explores and satirizes the paradox of narrative choice in game design. To wit, every choice you made was predetermined ahead of time, and it's results fixed before they began. So, you never really had a choice at all.And... it's a crock of♥♥♥♥♥♥ mostly.The Stanley Parable gets much attention for being the first game to bring these paradoxes to light and to explore them, and I think that's with good reason. The paradox basically only exists under a very narrow set of suppositions and understandings.The primary paradox represented is thus: because the outcomes of your actions are predetermined, as are the actions you take, your choices are basically meaningless. No matter what you do, you are doing what someone else wants you to do, and it will turn out how they wanted. While it seems like a gripping paradox at first, it has some serious problems. For one, the idea that choices having concrete outcomes dictated by outside agents or circumstance somehow makes the act of choosing meaningless is basically absurd on its face. Over and over the game hounds you with the idea that everything you do was accounted for ahead of time, that your actions are limited by the environment of the game, but then, our choices are limited by the environment of our lives. Where we live, who we know, what we've done, the laws of our nations, all of these limit the choices we can reasonably make. Get a job, or suffer the perils of homelessness. Feed yourself, or starve. Yet, that does not mean that these choices we are offered do not have meaning, or that meaning cannot be drawn from the act of making them. Bastion is a game with two choices, yet each choices hinges on the player asking hard questions. The act of making the choice forces an answer, leading to some kind of enlightenment. Even though we are only ever given four real options, options dictated to us by things that are not of ourselves, the very act of choosing betters us. The idea that choices having bound outcomes makes them inherently meaningless is essentially absurd and has no bearing on reality.Of course, what if the game only has one “real” ending? What if all your choices lead to only one conclusion? Wouldn't it then make any action leading up to it arbitrary? This is basically the ham-fisted aesop of the “Freedom” ending, hammered home with all the grace of a nuclear weapon dropped from the tail end of a plane. This certainly was the root of the outrage over the truncated ending of the Mass Effect franchise, and I can sympathize with this mindset to a degree. Of course, the problem with Mass Effect wasn't that it, essentially, had one ending. It is that players were told they would have multiple endings and then were delivered a game that had one. It is not that single endings are bad, but that the players were actually swindled into paying for a product that didn't exist.The fact is having a linear game does not, inherently, deny player agency or make the experience meaningless. For one, simply living through the life of another person can be engaging and enlightening. If this weren't true, then novels and movies would be meaningless forms of art. For another, the act of play itself can represent choices and give meaning along the way. Xeno Clash, barring its anachronistic storytelling, is about as linear of a game as one can get, yet the experience of being in that world and living that story gives perspectives and experiences that are interesting purely because they exist. Furthermore, how one plays the game can change things. The way you play a game can have an effect on you. Deus Ex has three endings made entirely by decisions you make in the last 5-20 minutes of game-play, and yes, these choices are almost completely independent of what you have done up to that point. Yet it is the little moments, the choices we make when even we choose how to play the game, that end up mattering and sticking out in the mind of players. I am reminded of a scene in Harry Potter, where the concept of destiny comes up. Just because something is going to happen does not mean we do not have choices in how we are to face it, and it doesn't mean our choices within these confines do not have meaning. Even simply to face the inevitable with dignity is a choice, and to do so has meaning and value on its own, as it says something about you and what you care about.Finally though, every game has a choice no developer can alter, which is the choice to engage at all. We have limited amount of time in their lives, so every moment counts in some way. To play a game at all is to choose to subject yourself to its rules and its consequences. That choice too, has meaning.The Stanley Parable asks a question that hadn't been asked before, and so it appears revolutionary and wise. There is no harm in that, but it presents its question with overweening condescension, and does not take time to consider if there may be an answer before it attempts to beats its player's brow with its supposed cleverness in having asked its question. It is a talking point in the history of game design, and considering its shortcomings can bring about interesting discussion, but on its own, it is ultimately narrow, mean-spirited, and not nearly as clever as it thinks itself to be. Even within the game its attempts to present the player as helpless fall flat as eventually the Narrator runs out of nasty things to say, lazy writing not-withstanding. Not even within the game can the story truly control the player, not can they stop them from simply turning the game off at any time.Which is, in all honesty, what I recommend you do."

Unfortunately after that the rest felt dull at best, annoying at most.A lot of players have described this game as a piece of art. I cannot agree. Having a narrator constantly make fun of the game, the player, and talking absurd nonsense, does seem like a dadaist concept, unfortunately this form of art being 100 years old nothing in this game feels particularly original nor revolutionary... neither is satire about office workers with a dull job.Applied to a game well... it just isn't very much fun. There is no gameplay per se, you just move the character as you wait for the story to unfold, so you may as well watch somebody else play it on yootoob.There was a section (the Museum) which I enjoyed visiting, as well as the first ending I got (the parody one) which I have genuinely enjoyed.

Think your about to go off into a new area of the game well your not. It will just start you over again in the same office. The game creator assumes you are stupid enough to be entertained by a fictional voice in your head that is supposed to be witty enough to make you forget your walking through the same rooms over and over and over again. Just a waste of time. I WANT MY TWO DOLLARS BACK MF!
76561198025549006,Not Recommended,221910,20056166,"Posted: 28 December, 2015",all,KeptinKurk,"MINOR SPOILERS – you’ve been warned.TL;DR, There was a lot I liked about the Stanley Parable, but I keep looking at that $4 I spent on it and I can’t help but think it would’ve been better spent on other games.Full Review:I purchased The Stanley Parable after watching Let’s Plays of The Beginner’s Guide and Dr. Langeskov, The Tiger and The Terribly Cursed Emerald: A Whirlwind Heist; they both look enjoyable and I felt I should give their first effort a try. The game was $3.80 during a Steam Sale and I felt that thanks to the overwhelmingly positive reviews that I should give it a try.“Quirky” is the best way I can describe the game, and it does a good of job of straddling the line between being clever and smarmy. I particularly enjoyed the “museum” sequence where you could explore the genesis of the game and abandoned pieces that never made it to the finished version.Truth be told, I regret it, even for $4. While I appreciate alternate forms of gameplay and narrative, there simply isn’t enough here to be worth the money, certainly not at full price.Initially you’re led to be believe that your job as Stanley is to find out what’s happened to your coworkers. But soon it becomes clear that you’re not really playing a game at all, and instead you’re exploring the philosophical ramifications of what it means to have “choice” and freewill. Distilling the plot down to a few sentences is reductive and doesn’t get to the heart of the enjoyment of the game; where the game really shines is the responses of the narrator to the choices you make, and the unexpected consequences that occur.The purpose of The Stanley Parable is to experience all of the endings, of which there are roughly a dozen. The decisions you make will lead to different endings, some surprising, some lackluster. The endings branch off from certain decisions you make (i.e., go in one door, or the other), and this in and of itself isn’t a bad thing. However, if you play through one ending and want to see what happens if you go the other way, it necessitates starting from the beginning and retracting your steps until you find yourself at the same decision making point again. If there was a time travel mechanic that allowed you to “hop” back to these points it would make the game less tedious, but then it would also shorten the game quite a bit.And that’s the crux of the problem. There is so much retracing of steps that it just feels like the game length has been padded. Had I not had to retrace so many times I’m sure I could’ve experienced all the endings in less than 20minutes. Is that enough game time for you to feel like you’ve gotten $4 worth of value out of it? Perhaps for you, but it’s not for me.If you’re looking for a game with good writing, some humour, and an interesting mechanic, I would recommend “To the Moon”. The story takes you on an emotional journey that is well worth your time, even if the game can be finished in a few hours. It’s one of the few games that’s actually made me cry, and I still think about it even months after I’ve last played it – it was worth every penny."

76561198046184246,Recommended,221910,8371958,"Posted: 28 December, 2013",all,Nutritious Bag Circles,"The Stanley Parable, hmm, honestly there isn't really much to say about this game, explaining what the game is about and how it works would spoil the experience according to the amazing and fabulous PC reviewers who are RockPaperShotgun and PC gamer, as for me I would explain certain things as to what the Stanley Parable is like and how I liked the experience , this is a review after all. To start off the ""real"" review I would begin saying this: The Stanley Parable is a unique game, its not groundbraking to be called a game that revolutionizes narrative storytelling in games since the game was based on its predicessor, a modification for Half-Life 2 which uses the same way of telling the ""story"" just with a ton more execution and contains certain parts that previous Stanley Parable players may instantley recognize and predict . The Stanley Parable is a game that gets inside your head, likes to toy with your mind and at times ""allows"" you to toy with the game.It is a game that can be non-sensical yet does it with a stroke that some may call genius. The Stanley Parable is also known for its predictions, if you have been playing  video games for quite some time now then you might understand a lot ofthe references that the Narrator in the game states. The game does this incredible thing with predicting the player`s actions and uses those predictions to the game`s advantage, this made me afraid to does anything in the game at, I felt that doing anything would cause the Narrator to speak of me and overall it was a wonderfull experience, this made me realize that this game is very well designed and very clever from the inside out. It overall takes trophes from common games and turns it into a gag.When I first bought the Stanley Parable I literally prepared the area around me to make this game a truelly genuine great first playthrough, because this is a game where the first play through can actually give an experience that is both memorable and leaves you thinking about life and the world of video games, and it is trully very pleasuring especially for someone who tends to think of a lot of negative things in the world and would like something to give them the taste of escape and distraction.Other things to mention about the actual game itself rather than its experience is that the Stanley Parable is technically not a ""game"" per say, you see this game is a part of the growing genre in video games known as the ""art installation"", such as titles as Dear Esther. To understand more I recommend TotalBiscuit`s explanation as to what a game is on YouTube. The Stanley Parable has an interesting color scheme and the Narrator voiced by Kevan Brighting is very well done. The game does use Source`s technology very well in certain segments, I was able to recognize some since I'm designing maps for Source and overall the game just feels nice and not uncomfortable. The level design is clever with the narrative and at times the level design does tell a story on its own that can sometimes even be a piece of the game getting inside your head. The music is well done with certain pieces and melodies playing in cetain and predictable spots, yet at some times the music used in certain segments of the game are just down right hilarious and enjoyable just as the game is getting inside your head and you doing the same to it again. Walking around in the game can overall be a nice and subtle feel that leaves mystery and wonder for the player, just as the game is designed and intended to be.In Conclusion the Stanley Parable is a game that needs to be experienced because it is a game that truly requires personal interpretation rather than an overall conclusion from a majority, thats why this review only states a few and leaves the rest for the reviewer to find out for themselves. This game can be seen as a shining example of the question of story telling in games but should be treated more as an experiment overall. So in the end do I recommend this game as a breakthrough ""video game"" with revolutionary mechanics and ways of storytelling? No, but do I recommend this game as a once in a lifetime experience that should be savored and makes you want to take a relaxing walk outside and think about life, video games, and the meaning of the number 8? Yes."

The game is very unique, very enjoyable, the naration is one of the high points of this game, great voice acting and immense differences in choices. Now i one of those people who buy multi-ending games and does only 1 ending, but this game has a way of making different choices seem like a whole new campaign, if you have watched someone play this before, it is even more fun playing it, even though you have seen it.. this game had me hooked from the intro... and i only have 10 mins of gameplay, but it will be 2hrs in 2hrs from now haha, great game to binge play. thankyou for reading my♥♥♥♥♥♥review!"

It had its cool moments but overall the experience was only of annoyance. The problem is that it does not touch the heart of people. It's a very emotionless game.Did you ask any girls to try out your game? I ask because they are blissfully less logical than us guys. I am very logical myself, but also very emotional, so it was easy for me to find the game annoying.What happened is that your game frustrated me. I felt like I was being taken into someone else's hallways, doors and plans, to deliver me an experience that didn't touch me. And worst of all I had absolutely no free will in the game, no way to change anything, no impact, no power, I accomplished nothing.People play games, because of what they can do inside them, and your game is very good at letting them know THEY CAN'T DO ANYTHING! Other things I didn't like were the ammount of narrator dialogue too much, and that 'Stanley' is repeated all the time by the narrator. Overall your game is on a good path! I think. Good Luck with it and best regards.-Λces"

It has so many endings that you will be playing it for hours despite the initially short story. There is even an ending that requires you to click buttons for four hours.Now we move to the negativesLike I said the game has multiple endings but these playthroughs will all be very similar and I found myself bored of playing it very quick. I was walking down the same places at the same speed hearing the same things and it just got boring.Overall, the game is good for a few hours of fun but I believe it is not worth the initial price of £9.99. I bought it on sale for just over £2. I would say if you are going to buy it buy it on sale! I am going to give it a 4.9/10."

If you are tired/bored with magic, zombies and guns then check out The Stanley Parable.It's very different from other games I've played.It's a bit like a Ground Hog Day situation where the Hero finds himself starting the day over again and each time you can make different choices.It has great humor and is Psychologically bent. I won't say more as I don't wish to spoil the game for others.Summary: Excellent Game, different and unique.Try it I'm sure you won't be dissapointed."

N/AWorth revisiting? Yes, in 5 years time to get the ""Go outside"" achievement ;)Best part – The script of the narrator and the delivery of the performance are utterly fantastic and without equalWorst part – Some endings are deliberately obtuse, be prepared to use a guide if you want to see everything"

76561198115134082,Recommended,221910,28963514,Posted: 2 January,all,Austrian Leninist,"The Stanley Parable is a fun little game that plays with giving you choices on your path through the game, and giving you the possibility of rejecting the narrator and 'the story' in order to make your own story, and due to the selection of choices you can make you'll end up getting different endings, giving it a sort of replay value. But although you have this replay value you probably wont play the game for longer than 3 hours in order to see most of the stuff you would want to see.(unless you do the baby game, because well, you would be sitting there for quite a while then, but sssh, no spoilers, go look for it yourself! I'm not gonna tell you. Or will I? Nah, look for it in the game, or on YouTube, but that'd be cheating. So go and play it, now. It's really enjoyable, trust me.)"
,Recommended,221910,10825473,"Posted: 26 June, 2014",all,TheTitaniumDragon,"This game is really quite good, but also very short. It is a very unique ""game"", but has little ""gameplay"" in the usual sense of the word; rather, the gameplay lies in the exploration of the game.If you watch the trailers and think they're interesting and amusing, you will think this is a great game. But realize that it only has 2-3 hours worth of content in it; once you've done all that, you're pretty much done with the game forever - anyone with a longer time played on it was probably trying to get one of the strange, off-beat achievements the game has to offer."

WE NEED MORE GOD DAMN CONTENT!! I feel the creator should really add in some new endings and lines for the narrator, but most of all, WALKTHROUGHS!!! I WANT THE DAMN WHITEBOARD ENDING!!!Anyways in the game you will be given a choice. Go with the crowd or go solo and make your own story. I really recommend to go against the system but still, do what you want to do. The game will allow it. The narrator may be sad but who cares, its just a game. The game also has lots of twist and hilariousness. I'm not going to spoil it because its such an awesome game but stanley should get is PAYDAY.

,Not Recommended,221910,8846532,"Posted: 25 January, 2014",all,Ethics Gradient,"*SPOILERS FOLLOW*On the surface, this game seemed to be right up my alley.  A fourth-wall breaking deconstruction of narrative choice and consequence in video games? Yes please!  And at a first play, it lives up to its promise; mechanically it's very smooth, the narration is well done and never feels forced, and the interaction between you and the narrator feels surprisingly organic.Alas, it has (in my opinion) two major problems.First, it's rather short; you can find the majority of the endings in a few hours of playtime, and once you've found them there's almost zero replay value in going back through any of them.  Once you're through the easy ones, finding the rest can be a bit of tedious guesswork, and it can quickly turn into a repetitious slog.  The narration becomes robotic and rote, the jokes run thin, and generally the 'fun' factor very rapidly falls off a cliff.  There are very few surprises left after maybe four hours of playtime, and the cracks in the artifice become obvious.  This is, one begins to suspect, part of the point; but more on that in a moment.The shortness and lack of replay value could be forgiven, if the ideas it played with were big enough or interesting enough to offset the small of fun.  Unfortunately, they aren't.  Yes, narrative choice in most games is a lie, and yes it's funny that even when we violate the dictates of the narrator we're nevertheless almost incapable of doing anything that hasn't been planned in advance by the game designers, and yes the only real free and spontaneous choice we have in the game is to turn it off, stand up, and go do something else, but this is nothing new.  The presentation in a video game is (somewhat) novel, but at the same time there's a certain amount of battering you upside the head with the point that goes on, and it ultimately deconstructs itself; it's a game that tells you that it's ultimately pointless to play games, that the entire experience is artificial and preplanned with zero true sponteneity, that the natural-seeming interaction between you and the narrator in the beginning was nothing more than a monument to your own predictability.  But the only way it can do that is by *not* being entertaining past a point, and *not* having any replay value.So; interesting?  Yes.  A nice change of pace from the usual FPS?  Definitely.  Briefly entertaining?  Most certainly.  Worth $15?  Not at all, in my opinion.  Ultimately it's a game that's hamstrung by its own key idea: a game that you pay $15 for just so it can tell you that you wasted $15.(Note: I have no idea why steam says I only have 2 hours of playtime; it's closer to 6 or 7, though honestly the last 3 weren't worth it.)"

It's some sort of weird intercative experience filled up with Portal 2 props and naratives.I don't really see how being an owner of this game (or not game) provides any value higher than any Youtube video of people playing this game (or, again, not game).

Tell me, when you go to an art expo, do you find that entertaining?  Assuming you were just there to look at the art and nothing else?  The Stanley Parable is a very short, very artsy game that I hesitate to even call a game.There are two flaws with the game.  One, it's short.  There are 15 endings as I remember and they can all be completed in about 10 minutes. Not that you are likely to even find all of the endings.  Some of them require looking up a guide to do and even then there are some ridiculous ones that no one is going to do. ie spend a day doing the same monotinous task until you trigger the alternate ending. Each ending reuses a massive amount of material so you aren't really playing anything different. In short, you don't get a lot of bang for your buck.  I'd say this game was worth 5 dollars, not 17...The second flaw is the narrator.  He's a great actor, don't get me wrong.  The dialog is great as well, but I just can't stand listening to the same voice giving constant voice overs for hours on end.  No matter how great an actor is, if there's only one, it gets boring.I think this game was rated highly because most game reviewers really didn't know how to review this product.  It is nothing like most any game you'll ever play, but you can't really call it a bad product either.  But I was bored stiff for almost the whole game."

One might think that the concept of the game and the sole intention of the developer is to teach the player a thing or two about choices and decision-making in game design, development etc, but I'd argue that they can also be applied to real life as well. The game almost forced me to think about where life came from, where it is now, where it is going, where it will end up at and whether it really matters at all.""When every path you can walk has been created for you long in advance, death becomes meaningless, making life the same. Do you see now? Do you see that Stanley was already dead from the moment he hit start?""Are we already dead from the moment we were born?I wouldn't call it a video game.

For starters if you have seen a playthrough of this game on youtube don't bother buying this, the game has nothing else to offer.  I have watched an entire playthrough for this game and it killed the only aspect that is great about this game... the narration.   After replicating a few things I had seen on youtube the concept felt very tired to me, it hadn't lived up the aspirations I once had for this game.  Now I just feel as though I have been let down.  However if you have not seen a play through i recommend this game,  For me this game gets a thumbs down unfortunatly.  I would however revisit this game if DLC becomes available it may have a chance to possibly revive the fun aspects of this game. The humor in the game I found to be good. 6/10"

,Not Recommended,221910,7981087,"Posted: 9 December, 2013",all,Vexium,"Don't play this game. It's a waste of money. You think it will be deep. Maybe in some parts it is - on a surface level. But ultimately, to save you time, here's the underlying message: games are really like real life, so go out and play in real life instead of following the computer's orders in a simulated environment.'Cept the reason you play videogames isn't to find one that is so downright dull that it is just like real life. And that's what The Stanley Parable really is. A steaming pile of utter garbage straight from the cesspools of mediocre game design and incompetent storytelling.Some people argue that this game is a work of art. Really? And what was artistically profound about it? The series of linear choices you made? The randomly generated changes when you completed an ending? The amount of metanarrative conceptualization and the hilarious ways in which you would waste your time trying to find entirely pointless developments that offered no insights?How about that ending that caused you to quit out of the game? Ooh boy, what an exciting ending. I'm sure that really got you going, eh. You got to walk around a museum and see what the game's creation really was like! Wow! Another brilliant narrative development.How about the time you followed a line for multiple playthroughs and the same boring, hackneyed idea was drilled into your retinas for close to 30 minutes?But, sure. Maybe that's art. Maybe. For some really hipster kids who don't understand what the word 'art' implies (hint: effort and creativity). Maybe you think wandering around a Halflife 2 mod's simulated version of an office with no gameplay mechanics is fun. Maybe you think Minecraft and Portal references are the peak of ironic allusions to consumerism in the digital world.Even then, The Stanley Parable is a worthless pile of dung, not fit for the cost nor the measley time it takes to play. By the way, the game lasts about... oh... 20 minutes per playthrough. And at best, you'll play it for 5 hours to find the endings you want by diverging on certain sets of linear paths (and yes, they are highly linear - not complex at all) to find the 10 or so endings the game offers.No, no countless narrative structures. No endless divulging explanations into games, into existence, into the power of choice. Just several rather typified remarks on life, society, and the digital age we live in. You'd find more entertainment in an Ayn Rand novel.Now, before you critique my critique, I have played through every ending and literally every variant of decision-making in the game. And that only took 3 hours. Most of the longer plots have interesting commentaries mixed into the heaping feces-filled drivel spouted, but those moments lasted less than 30 seconds and then I would return to the futile hell that is this so-called game. Overall, I could not be more dissatisfied with my purchase.What really gets me is how this game was presented - this is where some credit is due. It was marketed in such a clever way, as if it held some deep purpose or meaning, and then it literally quite honestly admits that it doesn't have that significance in the game. The narrator then proceeds to subtly mock you on your purchase decisions, all the while critiquing you as being the kind of addicted-to-computers-and-technology person that needs to get outside.And maybe the game is clever in that sense. It forces you to be so disgusted with its own pitiful mediocrity that you actually want to go outside rather than play it. It makes you feel sorry that you completed the game in almost every ending, as if to say, ""why would you ruin the little, terrible machine I've created?"" In fact, I think I'm paraphrasing the narrator pretty acurately there.The saving grace is the voice acting, but even that can't change the lack of ingenuity and utter stupidity that is The Stanley Parable.Congratulations if you already bought The Stanley Parable. You were suckered in just like I was, and you have officially fallen into the consumer trap that the game figuratively represents."

Really.I read the reviews, listened to the ones that said 'play the demo- if you like it, you'll like the game'. I played the demo, loved it & was so excited to play it that I bought it without even trying to wait for a sale. Totally regret that decision now.I *thought* I was getting a game you could really explore but I was so wrong- you are VERY limited in what you can do. It seems you have to remember previous routes you took or you end up taking the same few again... and again... even when you try not to. It quickly became tedious trying to find different endings and then annoying when you went through the same ending... again. I don't think that is something you can realize in 2 hours- which blows- because I seriously wish I could return it.For reference, my favorite games are the Portal games. (I would have liked to play with the portal gun in this game, if it gave me the freedom to explore the game more) Still looking for games I would like as much as those so if you have any recs, please send them my way.All in all, if you can get this for like $5, then give it a try. I like the idea of the game but not the execution. It did not live up to the hype for me at all and I am still super bummed I wasted $15 on it.TL;DR - Demo is better than the game, if you are interested in it, wait for a sale, not worth full price imo."

That's if it can even be considered a game in the first place. Words such as trivial, stale, and utterly cynical spring to mind as I think of playing through this offering.Essentially this ..ahem.. game.. caters to the person who wants to explore a preset, determined story-mode, with absolutely no freedom to invent one's own narrative or to really delve into the gameplay mechanics with multiple options and play-styles to complete it.Literally it's an observation game, where we listen to an overly-cynical narrator lamblast the protaganist for his mere exploration of what's on offer.Dare I say it, but Stanley's Parable could be included in a freakish new genre for a new breed of technology user - that of the 'post-game'. It's basically a program where players are treated to a mere simulation, in place of what was previously known as the immersive 'video game' that we all know and love.Lastly, I'd even describe this project as lacking in any real story. There is no character development, no advancing of a plot, and the only theme is that of a nihilistic, bitter emptiness that leaves me feeling patently unfulfilled. Each reload of the main 'story' is but a sterile repeating of the same thing over, and over, and over again, which in the end comprises nothing more than a two-bit hack job.Now, I'm off to play an actual down-to-earth, genuine game.

In The Stanley Parable you play as Stanley. He is employee 427 all he does is push buttons in the order that his pc tells him to. One day Stanley notices that he isnt getting orders so he embarks on a journey to find out whats wrong. So hows the gameplay ? Its an adventure where you make choices so you can see many diffrent outcomes. All you do is walk around and thats fine with me. Theres a narrator that narrates everything you do and comments on youre choices sometimes he says stuff that is laughing out loud funny. Theres not much to say about this one just thats its a fun game and plus it has over 20 endings to be achieved. Overall i payed the full price and wasnt dissapointed and if you like great dialouge and amazing script writing dont pass this up no matter what, but if you dont like games where you dont do much wait for a sale so i give The Stanley Parable A 8.8/10"

I died multiple times, heck I even went to heaven. You'd think I'd get a laugh or two out of the past 3 hours of gameplay, but alas- I did not. I sort of feel like this game tries too hard to be funny and doesn't achieve it. I can sort of see what they are going for, and I think it could've been done well but based on the amazing reviews of this game and how many people loved it, I really thought I'd found something amazing, but the truth is in the first few minutes of portal I laughed more times than I did in the past 3 hours of my life. Honestly I think I'm becoming insane from playing this game because the more I play it the more I question if every person reviewing this game is trolling on purpose to make people buy it because I don't understand how they could ever expect someone to pay 15$ for this. I tried to get some achievements by clicking on doors, I clicked on the door hundredsssss of times and no achievement. Not only does this game waste your time but it laughs at you while it steals your life away. You have been warned.Also it's worth noting if you purchase this game and also decide you don't like it, try to shut it down by the two hour mark.... don't leave it running while you cook dinner. I went one hour over and Steam won't refund me, which- I guess isn't the biggest loss, it was around 4$ on sale, but not only did it waste my time, it also took 4$ away from what could've gone towards a really great game."

I got this during the last days of the Summer sale, so I did not pay full price.After an hour and a half of playing, I had experienced all (except three, outlined below) the endings, made every choice and got most of the achievements. There is little-to-no actual gameplay, if you dont count moving from point to point and occasionally pressing 'E'. The entire game feels like a polished, but unfinished student project, something that has promise, but isn't there yet.The narration is, however, well written and performed, and the humor was genuinely funny in parts.Overall, everything good in this game can be experienced through watching half-an-hour of Youtube Lets Plays.

It isn't funny,  it isn't fun, it isn't immersive, it doesn't make me want to play it and it certainly isn't worth the $15 that i spent on it.  Nothing happens, you do not do anything, you cannot interact with anything unless the game wants you to do so and the Narrator's voice becomes a nuissance as well after constantly repeating the same bland dialogue.

I wish I could say that this game, much like the Kingdom of Heaven, is a hidden treasure, but, alas, it is not. If it is a hidden anything, its a landfill that has been covered over with a mound of dirt and turned into a park for children.My reasoning for this is simple: this game, while claiming to be a parable, offers NOTHING on the teachings of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. How can a game claim to be a parable if it doesn't teach those who play it about the Father, Son, and the Holy Ghost?

I kept playing and playing, looking for something that might be interesting, but it never happened.It's technically a game, but barely. It's more of a slightly interactive essay lamenting the 'illusion of choice' and how customers/users are 'dumb' and the narrator complains about how those 'dumb' users force game design to be dumbed down and that good design goes unappreciated.

Warning: spoilers follow.It is a first person explore all the endings game. You can't jump, crouch, or walk. You move at one speed. The only interaction you have is that you can click on a few rare things. You will explore various pre-set paths which are usually quite short (<15 minutes usually) and then start again at the beginning to explore the other endings. Your primary motivation? Voiceovers by the narrator. But honestly the gameplay is uninteresting and lackluster. It could honestly be released as a podcast by the narrator and there would be little reduction in the already meager value. I got a few laughs but in no way is this game worth 15 dollars.

This is, of course, is extended out to the point where it becomes a vaguely explored metaphor for the nature of life itself, before the now irksome nature of its ham-fisted attempts at satire are too irritable to endure much longer.This may sound critical - that's because it is. It's an honest review from someone who bought it for £4 on a sale and still wouldn't recommend it. With basically all potential endings explored within an hour, my time with this game ended before my time with most other games would be considered even begun. You could argue length doesn't matter, but for something that is too pretentious to really be artistic, it leaves me wanting far more.If you like the works of George Orwell, you might like this.

This game has17endings (or19, depending how you see it), which would have been interesting if ending #x was different from ending #y in more than entering door B instead of door A after walking by the same uninteresting place you did like 10 times already, just in order to get a different discourse from the narrator and some sort of closure (figurative example, yet close to the actual thing) ;- Game completely relies on satire and continuously ""breaking the 4th wall"" to build the whole narrative, repeating the same ideas over and over - it's thought provoking for about the first 20-30 minutes, after that it's just pretentious and overkill. The nature of the steam achievements alone paint an approximate picture of how hard they try ;- A bit overpriced for what is.------------------------------I had been eyeballing The Stanley Parable for months on end due to its reception, concept and the fact that recently I had developed a taste for walking simulators and feel keen to try anything in this genre. I bought it on sale for 2.39€, which really is on the cheap and, in my opinion, as much as anyone should be willing to give for this game, since you're buying into a concept more than you're buying an actual structured game. This game offers little when it comes to structured storytelling in lieu of having you walk to certain places and interact with certain objects to trigger a reaction from the narrator to understand what all of it is about. There are17endings (or19, depending on how you see it), in just over 1 hour I had seen close to half of them without rushing it one bit. I understand that The Stanley Parable isn't too bad if you're one to go allcompulsive hoarderlooking for all the endings, but for me it got really tedious fast. You get to an ending, you have a giggle, restart the game and go click on every object to find thenext one objectwhich you can actually interact with, or go back and forth looking for something that you might have missed, thirsting to hear the narrator say something new. It's a lot like in a museum, you go around checking every room and unless you're in some way passionate about what's being exhibited, you'll never really connect with the pieces and even just being there will seem pretty pointless. Since I hardly felt rewarded or enlightened while playing this game, as many people seem to feel, it really felt pointless just being there. Other than that,this game truly isn't as clever as people insist on imposing. Overall, this concept hastremendous potential, but The Stanley Parable still didn't make effective use of it.So no, I do not recommend The Stanley Parable. Given that most people think quite the opposite of me, you probably shouldn't let any negative feedback stop you from playing this game and experience it yourself. Just don't go in with your expectations too high like I did, expecting a game that actually plays like a game instead of a Source engine demo. One thing is certain: if you never played this game, you never played anything like it. So specially if you're a bit desperate to feel smart and avant-garde, you might as well pick it up.No hate // Real talk.3/10"

In this game it is all about trying every option and seeing the different endings. The endings are not special. For them to be special, the game should be played a little longer time and the story should be affected in some way. There is no story in the game and it lasts only a few minutes. After a few minutes of walking down the corridors you don't feel any ending to be make some sense. It would be OK if the game was funny. I didn't find it funny either.Visuals are nice and the controls are natural. But they don't justify the lack of fun in the game. I couldn't find a reason to continue to walk through it.

I was planing on a narrative value and some kind of gameplay mechanism. There is no gameplay, and that's on me, I should have looked up more about the game before jumping in.But, even if i try to evaluate the game only based on it's narrative value : I can't really manage to appreciate the narrative value in this game. Portal 1 has a simple story and well thought characters. Talos principle has a more complex story. Both game are also very immersive, you spend time progressing the story, you get plenty of situational or narrative content that implicate you in the story, in a way that you can reflect about machines, humans and life.For Stanley parable, you get a short novel with a few different versions with different endings, that start with a starting situation and 10 min latter end up with a bizarre ending, and nothing really elaborated in between to carry the player's mind to reflect on it's meaning, be it through progressiveness or reasoning. Freedom, death, life achievements and life choices are some concepts that get thrown at the player but with nothing more that a few minutes of raw content each time to bring up the topic in some way that feel quite random.The game is cheap (esp. on sale), so you can still buy it if you want a story based game that jump quickly to the results, its not that bad, and it runs on Linux.

Its one of those things that really makes you feel happy/sad/weird/upset, sometimes at once. Even though this game is certainly not by any means intended for hardcore gamers, it does offer a really interesting game experience that not many title can show up nowadays (and that is saying an awfully lot actually). The style is very unique, more like near to ""grotesque"". It doesnt try to hold your hand, its literally inciting you to see the things as they are by yourself, even if it means breaking that certain fourth wall.As the description of the game says: In this game, you will play as Stanley and you wont play as Stanley...."

You get to play many permutations of an unsatisfying and ultimately unrewarding simple walk through. With a narrative which might be entertaining were there a plot. Or game mechanic. Or aim.For whatever reason the kool aid didn't work on me. It's disappointing and you shouldn't waste your time.

Layers of Fear is a much more engaging walking simulator actually worth paying money for, though I think $20 is pretty steep.

Gameplay has no enjoyment, nor the element of eploration as all you do is walk thru the same room (redesigned) over and over again.This game has NOTHING to offer as it is NOTHING that you can call A GAME!Narrator was the only thing that is enjoyable in this game.

The narration is perfect! The graphics, for the most part, are really good - nothing to brag about though, especially since the character models are some of the worst I have seen in a Source game. The most disappointing part about this game is its length! It is literally the shortest game I have ever played (with a lot of decisions) but unfortunately the decisions are so easy to find that this game simply isn\'t worth buying! Modding Half Life 2 with this will be a better idea, hence it is free. This game is LACKING in content! It is rather shocking that we complain about games like Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes when there are games like this on the market! There is no replay value after beating the game in 1 day, which is disappointing to say the least. For its horrendous length, this game isn\'t worth it - even a minuscule price of £1.99. What would make this game worth it is BEING FREE! Now I am sure this game did need a lot of effort and cost (paying the developers) but this is not worth it! And if you are planning to get this game on not a sale, that is a really stupid thing to do! Try it, play it and refund it because it is really short and you can beat it before the \'maximum 2 hour refund\' policy mark ever reaches. It is unfortunate, as I actually really enjoyed it, but a game which has NO difficulty, without a desire for replaying, and is shockingly short, this game MUST be avoided! Unless you can get this for a price SO LOW that you literally can\'t get anything significant in the real world, then this game is not worth it."

The developers have this entire concept that a game never offers you choices, simply doors to take and instead enforces the idea you never actually make any of the choices you think you are, instead using predetermined paths from developers.The biggest flaw in the game is though that developers present you with decisions you are allowed to make on your own and the direct results of those decisions. The Stanley Parable takes that varaible away. The game ignores deciisions you make when the narrartor isn't happy with the decisions you made, predetermined or not.But in that very act, the developers are still delivering on what every other game does. Which are decisions. And the only one you can really choose is to simply turn off the game. The reality is Stanley Parable isn't really much of a game and it's my personal opinion that it shouldn't be classifed as a game, instead more of a social comment on the gaming industry.Even with this being taken into consideration I bought the game on sale because I thought it'd at least be funny. What you see in the videos is the very extent to how funny the game is. The reality is a lot of the game is spent forced into listening to the incoherent ramblings of the narrator, much of which is very dry and very non-funny.I don't recommend this game to anyone. Anyone saying this game is ""fun"" or ""funny"" or even ""intelligent"" are only trying to fit in with the rest of the crowd who somehow have been brainwashed into the idea that this is a game in any sense."

As for existential quandries, its mediocre at best. I suppose if you're just getting in to ""the universe"" you might find some of the ideas presented as fresh and exciting.

The Stanley Parable isn't so much a game as it is an interactive novel. This isn't the story of a man named Stanley, this is the story of a symbiotic relationship between Stanley, the Narrator, and you as a player. If the Narrator wasn't there for parts of the story there wouldn't be any way to progress, as his commentary gives clues - or sometimes outright gives the answer - to puzzles the player wouldn't be able to figure out on their own. Coupled with his accent and sarcastic attitude we get a great narrative experience that breaks the fourth wall over and over again, leaving me asking for more.Having played Dr. Langeskov as well, I'm greatly looking forward to seeing more games from these guys."

This is by far one of the best non-combat games I've ever played, and nothing has really matched up to it since. Not only is the design clever (they really think of nearly every possible decision) but the game's sense of humour is expertly delivered by the amazingly talented Kevan Brighting.Plus it has real world benefits, thanks to The Stanley Parable I now understand the importance of finding a really serious table to help me with those day-to-day choices."

Excellent narrator and programming - they have prepared dialogue for almost everything. Just try finding the broom closet and go inside and stand there. When the narrator finally goes quiet (and after you have stopped laughing! :D) go out and then back in again.And I like the subtle weird phenomenons they added... like going through a corridor gets you back where you started almost without you noticing, but the second time around you don't get back to where you started.. and if you try to go back and check if there where 2 corridors it wasn't - messes with your mind! But not in an ""in your face"" kind of way which is really nice. Most games would put up a big red sign ""oh look we made this happen now"" - here you could actually miss such things if not paying attention.All you have to do is walk and listen and make choices. It's not as easy as it sounds.That said, don't expect more than 3-5 hours of time killed by this game. On my 3.4 hours I tried most endings (I think so anyways, didn't google to get them all).

The game is never over.This game is about Stanley. Stanley is an office worker who spends life mindlessly pushing buttons on a computer. One day he realizes that all of his coworkers have disappeared. From that moment on, you traverse the sprawling office building trying to find out where they have gone. But as you find cracks in the walls, never-ending hallways, and a strange feeling of helplessness, you may question your own sanity.The sole purpose of this game is to take every expectation you have of what a video game is, burn them down in front of you, and mock you for having them. the game will challenge you, frustrate you, amuse you. You have total control of your free will, and yet you have no choice. At some point along your journey you may even finish the game. It won't be enough. You'll come crawling back to the sterile office to throw yourself at the whim of your devious overseer.Is Stanley real? Is he insane? Is he being watched? Is he truly alone? Where has everyone gone? Were they ever really there in the first place? The player is thrust into a world of doubt and confusion. Perhaps if you keep exploring these winding corridors you will discover the truth... everything else is just a carrot on a stick.WARNING: Do not look up cheat codes, gameplay footage, walkthroughs, or spoilers for The Stanley Parable. This is a game in which the unknown plays a crucial role. Explore, seek alternate routes, keep trying, but NEVER go to the internet for help. This is a game that should be played through personally for the most emotional impact. I can still log in and discover something new about this world. Spoilers and walkthroughs ruin that. This is for your own good.This game is 100% worth the $15.00 I spent on it. This is hands-down the most facsinating game I have ever bought. Half of the time it's on sale, so you have no excuse not to get it.I laughed, I cried, I had an existential crisis. 10/10, and I don't give those out lightly"

It gives the impression of astounding depth just because of how simple it all is. The narrative and the numerous different points where you can make a choice make it seem like there's always something more. That of course is the charm and main idea after all ""the end is never the end is never the end, etc.."" I'm not afraid to say this is one of the only games that made me laugh rather than inwardly chuckle a little. Having this experience with the narrator led to some great funny moments. As to how that whole narrator mechanic works as a whole....well it's hard to describe because the game will explore different ways the Narrator, the player and Stanley could of interacted and all of the possibilities are sepperate from eachother. The narrator is motivated by telling a story, the player is motivated by choice, and Stanley by pushing buttons for the most part. How these three interact changes as the possibilities branch out. There are many ways the game tries to get the player to think about freedom of choice, reality, and the nature of games. The appeal of this game is none of the singular branch paths you could of taken but rather a point in the middle of the game where you are astounded at where a certain set of decisiions took you and you now are motivated to try another set."

After all that time, it takes a really special, unique, new game to pique my interest. I still buy games, and play them, but many are extremely formulaic.   Valve have managed to sidestep a lot of the train-tracks that many of the enabling technologies seem to force game designers down, and have been handsomely rewarded for their ingenuity.Along came The Stanley Parable.   I've resisted buying it, because it looked like a mod.  For the same reason I avoided Portal.  I made a mistake in both cases.  Both share a wonderful self-awareness and a fantastic interplay with the player that really breaks that 'fourth wall'.   Narration reminiscent of the amazing work of Tony Jay in countless other games and films.I actually found myself, while playing TSP, saying ""Touché"" when the game foiled my own attempts at cleverness, and seemed to mock me for thinking I was thinking outside the box.    The main thing that really REALLY experienced gamers have to remember:  This is NOT Half Life.  Normal game mechanic rules DO NOT APPLY.If you've played every game out there, and think you've seen it all.  If you're fed up with the same old drudge, and are looking for something short, fresh, and extremely humourous, this is a good choice for you.If you're looking for something with guns and all the depth of a puddle, this is not for you.  You will play this game the way it wants you to play it. You will play it your own way.     Well worth it at £8 or £9, an absolute STEAL when on offer."

The game explores the clash most gamers have between themselves and the linear nature of most games. The narator (the only other character in the game) will attempt to guide stanley (you) through a story. At several points you will be given the ability to defy him or go along with the story. The whole thing is smart, funny, and entirely insightful. The only problem is the playtime, I saw everything there was to see after about 2 hours. My friend completed the game in about 2 hours aswell. This game would be so great if it was just longer. If you buying this game to pateronize art than this is a great buy.

You play as Stanley in a sort of scenario similar to that of stranger than fiction, but you can challenge the narrator with what choices you make. Then the next time through change your decision for a distinctly new experience. These choices are throughout the game. But really in the end you have no choice. It is still very scripted. The humor is great and unique, and the social commentary satisfying.  There were a couple endings/routes I still didn't know about after I thought I had exhausted all possibilities and they were worth looking up. Some of the Steam achievements for the game are sortof weird and I wouldn't bother with achieving all of them. Only criticism I have is the incompatibility with my native resolution/monitor. I had to go into steam and set the startup options for the game manually to force 1920 X 1080 and still then I also had to force windowed mode in the same options. Then I had to go and find a proper virus free small little smart program to install to make my windowed mode borderless. So it did take a little extra work."

The core of the game is the relationship between Stanley - that's you - and the Narrator - the fancy sounding male voice who will respond to your actions and choices with a wide variety of emotions, reactions, and conclusions.  Sometimes he's your best friend. Sometimes he's your mortal enemy. Sometimes you accidentally do things you don't intend to do and surprise everyone involved.This game does not take a lot of skill to play, and it's open-ended narrative makes it a joy to play. Normally I say you absolutely 100% should have a mouse to play a game on the computer - especially first person stuff. But the Stanley Parable is a very slow and relaxing game that can be played at your own pace - even to the annoyance of the Narrator.I'm ashamed I did not get this sooner. If there's anything BAD that can be said about this game, it's that it's not a very deep game. Gameplay-wise. It's very intellectually stimulating actually, but the depth of content is a bit shallow. The Stanley Parable is a wide, branching game with a dozen different endings from obvious but important choices and has good incentive to try and see them all; but each playthrough is rather quick. It is not bothersome at all while playing, but now that I've seen it all I can't help but wish for more."

If you have not played this masterpiece of game design, Basically it's about a guy named Stanley and his job is in an office pushing buttons all day but decided to go to his bosses office and then you start to control him and you can walk around your office and go around the building. It's sounds boring but it's not because of the narrator. He is your ""guide"" I say that for a reason but you have to play the game to find out. He is so snarky and hilarious. The whole game is all about choice and it can be kinda linear but you can stray off some paths of your chosing. But the narrator plays a big role but i won't spoil it all for you. I have not even finished the game yet because there is a ton of multiple endings. Your basics such as controls, sound, graphics, etc, are just great all you do is move around and interact with doors and other objects. I used an Xbox 360 Controller and it works really well and i recommend using it but whatever suits you. So overall The Stanley Parable once again is a brilliant, smart, clever, and very irreverent and surreal game you have played in a while. Again I highly recommend it for two reasons, one it is on sale for like $5.00 and thats a fantastic deal right now for the Steam Summer Sale, and two it is very replayable because of the multiple endings, hope you enjoy the game you won't regret it."

,Recommended,221910,10739548,"Posted: 23 June, 2014",all,<Eto> Mr. Eight-Three-One,"This an...interesting game. Oh who am I kidding, it's pure genius. You start this game off as a man named Stanley, who was content with his overly boring job of pushing buttons on a keyboard when he was told to. One day, though, his work environment becomes vacant. What could this mean?That's about all you can say without spoiling anything about the game. Reading any more reviews will tell you pretty much the same thing. Now, the concept of this game sounds really stupid when you first hear of it; it starts off beign pretty on-rails, until you come up to two doors. The narrator will say Stanley entered the door on his left, but that doesn't mean you HAVE to take the door on the left. Here's where it gets interesting -- the more you deviate from what the narrator wants, the more you deviate from the plot. There are many different endings to the game depending on the path you take, and some of them have to be seen to be believed. The results end up getting laugh-out-loud worthy at times. What truly sells this game though is the narrator himself. He is the perfect mix of sophisticated and snarky that makes him so perfect for the role, especially when you begin disobeying him. Of course, there's the famous broom closet scene, but that's only a small glimpse of the hilarity in the game. You really have to play it for yourself to find out how hilarious it is.If I had to come up with one downside to this game, it's the shortness relative to its price tag. I got everything I wanted out of this game in about two hours, which makes me question its $15 price tag. I got it at $6, which I think was a good deal. If you can get it while it's on sale, I say go for it. You will not regret it."

It is a lot of fun to run around and listen to the narrator adapt to your actions. Funny, fun and thought provoking, definitely worth your time.Cons - Not a whole lot of interactivity with your environment. I can't see much in the way of replayability besides showing your friends. and although the experience is intense and worth your time, the ~3 hours worth of gameplay is not worth the 15$ pricetag. if you could pick this game up for around half price I would highly suggest giving it a shot."

No matter what you do, there is no real ""winning"" in The Stanley Parable. Instead, you have a plethora of decisions you can make through each playthrough and Stanley (you) usually gets screwed in the end by the narrator!The narrator is possibly the icing on the cake in this game. The proper, soothing, and partly dark voice of the narrator as he tries to dictate your every move immediately reminds you of invisible walls and other impassible objects that hinder our exploration in games. As he tries to lead you through the linear storyline, he becomes annoyed with you if you deviate from the path. During one of my playthroughs, he was so mad at me that he actually restarted the game.

Get this game when it is on sale for around $5-$7 depending on what your funds look like, in my case I'm extremely limited most of the time, which is why, if you two find yourself more often then not only able to get games that are on sale for $5 and under, should wait until this game is cheaper. If you are someone that finds you can splurge every once in a while, the normal $7-8 price when the game is on sale is about fair.

Especially in the gaming industry. Everything we can do is programmed. I also saw that there is a reference to what books were compared to the Tora (Paper rolls still used by the Jews. Christians had a better way of spreading knowledge by using books.). And games are compared to books what books are compared to the Tora. A new way of spreading knowledge. More efficiently with less words used (A picture says more than a thousand words.). But apart from that great message (my interpretation), it contains too few playing hours compared to the price. It was a great Mod, but still not sure 'bout the game.Game is great but it's a little bit over-priced, at least imo. So try to get your hands on a great deal, i.e. 50% off, like I did.

(for example, there are sections where you are ""stuck"" and the only way to get out is end the game, and sections where the illusion of a choice is presented, when it does not in fact exist (this is satirical of video games in general, bus frustrating when it is not made clear that there is not actual choice)) The game is overall very very short, with each of the multiple ""endings"" only slightly different from one another, and several of them are the exact same until the tenth minute (each one can be comleted in less than ten mintues, there are maybe 9 or 10 possible endings). and that isn't speed run finished in ten minutes that is listening to everything the narrator says and reading stuff etc. in ten minutes.I bought this game because I saw the demo from rev3 and thought it was hilarious, but the actual game is not as funny as the demo, and is probably the same in length.

Perhaps he'll follow the plot, or play about and discern the nature of choice and control in this humorously told adventure."

,Recommended,221910,10615691,"Posted: 21 June, 2014",all,shorester,"8/10This game is another charming example of modern gaming that bucks conventionality. Rather than providing the player with anything he or she might expect, the game provides a meta-commentary on the nature of expectations and gaming, skillfully satirizing players and designers alike. The game's narrator is your only opponent, in so far as he is an omnipresent omniscient commentator on your behavior that seems to have Matrix-like powers to reshape reality to his will. He's a mix between GlaDos and the narrator from Stranger Than Fiction. As Stanley, the mostly faceless, personality-free protagonist, you encounter a series of choices and have to live (or die) with the outcomes, much to the narrator's chagrin. In terms of enjoyment, this game is akin to watching a really clever and hilarious half-hour pilot of an animated series that will never be picked up. You partially feel sad that you're investing your time in a concept with no real longevity, but you won't regret the experience itself. There are moments when I had to stifle my laughter late at night so as not to wake my neighbors.The actual experience of playing The Stanley Parable can be best described as a waking dream. You feel simultaneously powerless and rebellious, intrigued but unsure. You might find yourself asking, ""Is there any way to beat this game? Is beating this game even a reasonable objective considering the circumstances? Am I stuck in an infinite loop, the mindless plaything of a sadistic god?"" You'll alternate between laughing at the narration and cursing your own predicament, hoping you can outsmart a system that tells you from moment one, you're incapable of outsmarting anything. With cleverness (or perhaps a guide) you'll find nooks and crannies buried in this one, and if it's offered on a Steam Sale or discount, it's a hard game to pass up. In terms of replayability, it has that dream-like quality where you enjoy the trippy feeling of interacting with the universe, even when it feels contained and stacked against you. You might pick it up from time to time just to experience it again or to share it with your friends, even though the content itself is not very extensive.A game that can actually make me laugh goes a long way in my book, and this game is very funny. I greatly prefer it's tongue-in-cheek insecurity, philosophical and self-referential musings to the sort of redundant broad humor as Stick it to the Man, another game I tried recently whose laughs rarely match up to its ambitious artwork. Stick It To The Man is the exact inverse of this game, where you're compelled to keep playing because of the gameplay itself, rather than the jokey narrative that strings it together. The Stanley Parable is about losing yourself down a rabbit hole where there is so little interactivity, it's like one of those dreams where you try to punch someone but your hands feel like they're stuck in molasses. There's layered meta-satire here: Stanley is a put-upon seemingly purposeless office worker whose life's work is a cog in someone else's design. Similarly, the Narrator's seemingly straightforward lifework, a basic narrative, is continually undermined by the player/Stanley. The game reiterates that they both need each other to survive, yet their relationship is by its nature antagonistic and oppositional. Haven't we been programmed by games and movies to rebel against conventionality for the sake of cliche: a lone wolf hero's noble quest for individual freedom? There are more than a few nods to Portal in this vein, but The Stanley Parable prefers that you reconsider your instinctual gaming behavior rather than simply mockings its peers.The most startling thing about this philosophical and introspective journey is not just that it manages to be consistently funny, creative and inventive all while looking intensely drab and having very little interactive content. It's the fact that it manages to perceptively boil down the crux of modern gaming conventions into easily digestible doses. When we play Bioware games, we crave the choices and branching decision trees because it seems like for one brief instant, our decisions have lasting impact on this vibrant fictional world. Stanley is constantly vying for that type of freedom and power, and the narrator is constantly squashing him under his thumb to remind him that sometimes a story needs a focused narrative to find its beginning, middle and end. Yet the real story and sensation of playing The Stanley Parable is found between the lines of the narrative, in the existential Groundhog Day-like hell of being Stanley, and the Narrator's lonely, vengeful and ennui-based behavior. These two characters are at their best when they're at their worst, and in that way, they truly do belong together."

The story, while seeming like a simple concept, was done brilliantly with all the choices you can make, all of the endings to find, and not to mention the sense of humor. I'm serious, this is without a doubt one of the funniest games of 2013 (which is pretty difficult to even consider since I found Grand Theft Auto 5 really funny). The broom closet ending, the game where you save the baby from the fire, the disco ending, pretty much everything had me laughing. I am a little disappointed though that once you do everything there is to do in the story, there's not much else that the game has to offer. I am willing to overlook this, though. Despite being able to complete the game really quickly, you can still look for other secrets and easter eggs. And trust me, there's many of them that are really hard to find.

You'll often laugh or question as you spend hours exploring all the different paths. I think what makes the Stanley Parable is the narrator, I feel the same about Bastion. He seems to have character to bring alive what at first seems like boring office job simulator 2014. It's clear a lot of thought went into the game, and this constantly shows through it's clever jokes an incredibly miniscule amount of players will get, to its comment on being trapped and caged in jobs we hate. I think this game isn't so much as a game, more an experience, like and interactive film that puts you in the staring role.

The result is a hilarious experience which differs from every different turn you take. There is a total of 8 endings to the game, all are funny and unique, and Kevan Brighting's voice is perfect for the already likeable character that The Narrator is.However, the game itself is surprisingly short, even with the multiple endings, but it is definitely worth the price tag for the amount of fun you'll have with it.~~9/10"

At least, that’s what the narrator would say.You are Stanley, a lovable every-man, who arrives at his place of work – a standard office complex – and after a full hour of waiting, not a single command has appeared on his computer monitor telling him what to do. Incidentally, all of his co-workers are gone. And then things get a little strange.The kindly narrator guides Stanley down the corridors and halls of the office building while Stanley tries to locate his missing colleagues. On this path, Stanley comes to a very special room, which is where the plot spoilers in this review end. Suffice to say, things then get a little strange.The Stanley Parable’s hook is repetition. After a plot arc has been completed – or gets hopelessly stuck in a paradox – the game restarts itself, sometimes very jarringly. The ‘main storyline’ takes a surprisingly short amount of time to complete on your first run-through, and feels incredibly lacklustre. That is, until it becomes apparent that the main story has nothing to do with the game. And then things get a little strange.The Stanley Parable is a game based wholly on the story, and how your actions change the game around you. Every decision the player makes diverts the story down a different plotline, with immediate and very satisfying feedback from the world you inhabit. Every decision creates such a strong and noticeable difference to the gameplay that even in such a self-referential game the sense of immersion is fantastically held throughout.Stanley’s primary interaction with the world is through the Narrator, via the honeyed tones of Kevan Brighting. The writing in The Stanley Parable is rock solid – shoulder to shoulder with titans of interactive storytelling such as Bastion and Silent Hill 2. The tone is consistently entertaining, funny and totally engaging – unless you ever have to kill Stanley in which the narration understandably switches to sad and surprisingly gut-wrenching. The voice-acting, combined with such strong writing, is the main reason you’ll come back to this game again and again.Much of the original hype for The Stanley Parable came from the demo, still freely available on Steam. The demo contains absolutely zero plot content but instead takes you on a tour of the metaphorical factory in which the game was built, introducing you to the very tongue-in-cheek humour the games does so well. Spoiling nothing in the main game, it boasts 100 percent of the feel and comedic tone of the actual game.The Stanley Parable is a mind-blowing addition to the interactive-storytelling genre, and with over seven hours of play, the game is still engaging, funny and well worth checking out if you have an hour to spare.8/8"

The problem is it allows you to click on everything, but only accepts clicks on a very very few items, which quickly frustrated me and my figure-everything-out style of play. It doesn't take long to finish the game entirely, and once you've found the different Endings there's no replayability factor. Plus if you're particularly impatient you can just look for the dialogue/Endings on Youtube and you've pretty much seen what it has to offer.HAVING SAID THAT, I LOVE THIS GAME.I love the concept, and though I feel they could have gone further with it, I appreciate anything that tries something new and makes it work. I finished this game in a few hours, but I spent those hours happily involved, unable to stop playing, and generally giggling like a loon. The narration is amazing, both in voice and content; some of the ending ideas were truly creative (I particularly enjoyed the Adventure Line!) and it rewards people who insist on finding out every little thing you can do with the game, rather than those who want to get to the finish line as fast as possible. I truly hope it gathered enough attention from the right people to potentially embrace this choice-making concept and branch it out further - rather than 20 or so endings, could a game be made with hundreds?I adore this funny little game. It's not for those who want something they can drop hundreds of hours on, but definitely worth spending a few dollars."

I loved the concept and the commentary. I don't like the fact that people keep comparing it to portal, because it's almost an exact opposite.

,Recommended,221910,9403948,"Posted: 9 March, 2014",all,Dusty Bronco,"This is one of the coolest games I've ever played. Don't worry, no spoilers.The first time you boot up this game, you're going to feel like a kid in a candy aisle. You're going to be presented with so many choices and things to do, and so many things to see. You're going to be overstimulated and probably spend five minutes in the starting area, poking around for hidden things. Then you'll make your first choice. That was easy. And then your second takes a little more time. Maybe you won't have a third. Then it ends...and you start again.The narration is brilliantly executed; a real five star job. The setting is familair but unnerving. There's even a strange force that becomes a new character, in a way, and it's all so intriguing. It reminds me so much of Portal 2, in how they can take something as unassuming as an office, give it incredible detail, and subvert your expectations. And, wow, how the different paths can vary...even something so minute that you don't even realize that it's a possible choice can lead you in such an incredible new direction. There was a point where I thought ""Hey, is that...can I maybe just...I CAN!"" and the current path was unforeseeably diverted. Maybe you'll know it when you see it, too. Probably not.Even if you've played the mod, this standalone is not only a fresh coat of paint, but there are a few things I don't remember from the mod (although, that may just be me). Either way, the developers deserve to be rewarded for an AMAZING journey into game design. I may buy this game twice, if I can. It's a brilliant gem.My complaint is that some of the objects have really poor textures, and the render distance is pretty bad. I really wish that they had HD textures available. You'll squint your eyes to read what's written on a mug, for instance, and sometimes computer screens and documents are completely illegible. That's a real shame, as vicarious detail (even for inconsequential things) is something I LOVE in video games. There are secrets and easter eggs in here, but the small details aren't too important. Still, that's a small scratch in an otherwise gigantic diamond.Buy this game."

You’ll probably be done with this game in about 5 hours or so.This will be another difficult one to talk about without spoiling anything, but The Stanley Parable is kind of a “choose your own adventure” with a narrator that describes all of your choices. You’ll likely keep restarting the game even after you’ve gotten an ending just to see what the other endings are. The game has a fantastic sense of humor and frequently breaks the 4th wall and pokes fun at video game tropes. The writing is excellent. Some endings will make you laugh, others will make you think. My favorite endings do both.I would recommend this to nearly everyone, just know that it’s unfortunately pretty short.For more game reviews, check outhttp://whatisjamesplaying.blogspot.com/"

It would also probably never get out the door due to all the endless bickering over who had creative control.While The Stanley Parable itself is quite short in straight play-time, it's anything but completed in a single play through, for there are multiple endings, and if you have any sense of humour you'll need to play it through the same way multiple times to get all the little jokes you otherwise missed because you were laughing so much the first time round.The game itself tackles all the hard questions, such as just what is choice, why does it matter if you have one, and just which door are you going to walk through. It brings to light the issues with linear progression that free world games do not. It tackles that fundamental part of game design - Just where should the game end, does it have to end at all, or are all endings just beginnings? - and pushes it down an open lift shaft, strapped to a chair, while dancing.Unsure? Play the demo. Once again, it's totally unlike the game (well, except it's remotely visually like the game, and the Narrator is the same, and once again it makes you think about choice), yet it captures the essence of the game in ways that can't even be thought, let alone captured in a bunch of button presses.

,Recommended,221910,8145329,"Posted: 20 December, 2013",all,LegioCorvus,"I'd recommend this game, but only very barely.This game may be a victim of its own hype, but in my experience, it didn't live up to those expectations.  There is very little action on the viewers part.  You largely go down hallways, listen to the narrator, and constantly make left / right choices.  Depending on which order you choose these, you get the different endings to the game.  There are some neat ideas and endings here, but the paths can become repetitive to get to them, when the only difference is the final left / right after a long string of these choices.The narrator is a nice touch, and if you told me that the original version of this game came out before Portal, I could see how the narrator was an obvious influence on the much better GLaDOS in Portal.  However, the original version of this game came out 4 years later, and in my experience, barely does enough with the lightly mocking voice leading you through the adventure.The length of this game is also not much.  After deducing the system, I was quickly able to get nearly every ending in under 2 hours.  I didn't realize these were the different endings, as nothing explains as much, and you are quickly ported back to the beginning of the game to start again.So, this isn't much of a game.  That seems to be a trend this year.  But is there artistic merit?  A very reluctant yes.  It's clever, but being clever seems to be about all it has going for it.  There are some parallels to be drawn between gaming and mind control, but it's so light that most of the allegory needs to be filled in by the viewer.One of the hardest endings to get requires the viewer to click a button for 4 hours.  Another difficult achievement is to play the game for an entire Tuesday.  Light, fun, mocking commentary on reaching achievements in video games, but this seems to be about as deep as the rabbit hole goes.  Even then these examples are outliers compared to the much easier achievements and endings.So why would I recommend it?  Like I mentioned, it's clever and quick.  Not overly clever, but just enough to entertain, and there are some funny moments.  However, keep in mind the length and notable lack of gameplay if / when you acquire this game.  If you're the type of gamer with a small budget that can only get games once in a great while, I'd highly consider checking out other propositions."

This game consists of me wiggling a small stick and the cat leaping, pouncing, biting and whacking at the stick with her paws. Sometimes I drag the stick in front of the cat, other times I gently beat a tattoo on her forehead. Sometimes I prod her belly or make the stick poke out from beneath a towel.  My cat is equally confused, annoyed, amused and overjoyed by all these interactions, never quite sure what the stick is going to do next but quite happy for me to keep confusing, annoying, amusing and pleasing her with my magical, unpredictable, always-exciting stick.Which brings me to the Stanley Parable. This game is ""whack the stick"" for humans. What is the goal of the game? What is the message the developers are trying to convey? How do I win (or, for that matter, lose)? None of this is explained. Or it is explained, and then immediately contradicted. Or perhaps it is not explainable at all. But, like my cat, I can't help but keep whacking at the game exploring all the possibilities.With its simple graphics and uncomplicated gameplay (the latter is little more than walking around and occasionally pushing a button), the Stanley Parable is less ""game"" than interactive experience. There is no challenge to this title; no monsters to vanquish or puzzles to solve. Judged on that basis, the game is a total failure and those looking for a game that tests their reflexes or mental acuity will be sorely disappointed. Rather, this is a game, like ""Gone Home"" or ""Dear Esther"", that is more about wandering about and soaking in the atmosphere. But unlike those more pretentious and serious minded titles,  The Stanley Parable is far more tongue-in-cheek, greatly aided by its surreal architecture and the awesomely droll narration by Kevan Brighting, resulting in a game that can be as unexpectedly thought-provoking as it is rip-roaringly funny (no computer game has ever made me laugh as much as did Brighting's laid-back narrative responses to my actions). If the game has any fault, it is in how short it is; you can reach any one of its endings in ten or fifteen minutes, and - with some effort - can probably see all the game has to offer in three or four hours. But every minute of those four hours will be an enjoyable treat.Clever, unexpected, funny and sometimes twisted, the Stanley Parable is a welcome change from the trite and overused cliches common to most other games, and every gamer should play it at least once."

In order to win, all you need to do is follow the directions of the narrator. If you choose to be punk rock like myself though, things get real meta real fast. All because you chose one door over the other or went up instead of down. This interactive story is truly entertaining and thought provoking. Do we ever really have control of anything?

I still recommend this though, but I felt that I read too many positive reviews of this before I played this game.  So I had the highest expectation when I started playing this.Yes, I was expecting a lot more from this game.  This game didn't quite meet my expectations.  I was expecting something more profound, more enlightening, inspirational, life changing, soul searching kind of...umm...stuff.  Maybe it did have a little bit of everything that I was looking for.""To be or not to be, that is the question"".  This game reminds me of this famous Shakespeare quote.  It seems like it presents many questions about existence and reality, but there really isn't any answer(there really isn't any definitive answers for these type of abstract questions anyways). But they seem to present all these questions in a very subtle way for you to think about.  Personally I'm used to thinking about these existential questions… maybe this is the reason the game didn't quite meet my expectation...maybe for a person who never think about this type of thing will find the game more refreshing?The game is all about replayability(which is not a real word).  I usually dislike replaying a game; but this game is so short, it almost seem mandatory to replay over and over again to go through all the different paths and endings.  But I didn't mind it, all of these multiple endings are all very interesting.I guess what I love the most about this game is the humor, it actually made me laughed out loud a few times.  Perhaps the game is saved by this charming and yet sometimes annoying narrator.  One word of advice, don't take this game too seriously, just try to appreciate the humor, and I'm sure you will have fun with this game."

Staring at filing cabinets for an hour whilst an unseen voice drones on about how futile it all is. I did enjoy this game, but only for the first twenty minutes. The multiple endings become a repetitive, fruitless labour, with only a few button presses and basic mobility for the player to perform.The Stanley Parable clearly wants to be a critic's darling and a clever poke at the structure and rationale of video games, but after the originality is tempered by yet more filing cabinets, I started to feel like the joke was on me. No doubt, the developers intend for you to realise just how well they mock the genre, but they achieve this by giving you a game which is fundamentally very thin and boring beyond its air of (unresolved) mystery. There is little actual narrative, there are basically only three or four levels.Overall, the game might be worth £4 max, but you'll be left feeling mocked and shortchanged at full sale price. It would make a great change of pace chapter in a bigger, better game; but falls flat as a standalone."

While there is a narrator thats ""telling you what to do"" the game is actually quite open ended and you can do what you want. There are so many endings to this game i dont think i have seen them all and i have seen quite a few endings. The thing is every time you play you dont know what you're going to get. You might get the same or you migh get something different. Although the game is relatively short and one ending can be acheived in nearly 5-10 minutes some take longer time and what the narrator has to say is either really funny or interesting. It's hard to tell sometimes if hes on your side and to be honest i still don't know if he is or not. I have about 3 and half hours played with this game it is kind of short which is a down side, but at the same time it isnt because theres still endings i havent seen so im not really done with it.

Or high art for that matter.Oh sure, it takes place in a 3D engine we've encountered in countless games (in the true sense) before, and it utilizes a first person perspective, and you can press a single key to ""interact"" with about 12 different objects in the game... 11 of which are doors.  Is that all it takes to convince you that this is indeed a ""game""?  Then by all means, buy in to the hype along with everyone else and enjoy this game that isn't a game, story that isn't a story, BS that isn't BS.It's a paradox you see, and since we all know that High Art = paradox, if game = paradox, then, by jove, game MUST = High Art!

It's a fun play-through if you get it on sale, but I wouldn't recommend full price.  The MetaCritic ratings are too high, mainly due to this genre being undefinable within categories and the need for the critic media to step away from the latest FPS to vouch for the newest up-and-coming artist mentality.

Multiple endings, including some of the most mundane you will ever see, the game will have you trying for every possible endiing. With each restart, the level design changes subtly (and sometimes not so subtly).The narration is first-rate, and anyone who was wowed by the dynamic narration of Bastion or interactions with GLADoS in the Portal games will get a serious kick out of this.There is a lot to see and do, and I particularly recommend trying to find the ending which will put you in the credits room - literally an in-game museum dedicated to the game's development. However, I personally felt that you can probably see enough of the game to be satisfied with your completion within 2 hours.Still, it is a fantastic game, and definitely one I want to share with others."

It satirizes the whole concept of choice and linearity in games and does it in a really funny way. The star of this game though is the narrator and when you play it you'll see why.I can understand this game might not be everyones cup of tea and the best recommendation is if you did't like the type of humour in the Portal games you probably won't like this.

But wait. You spend money to play the game and then spend time beating the game and spend time to get money to spend time to play the game to spend time to reccommend a game. Is it really a game? Was it not all for naught? Isn't life itself the game? Maybe if you took a second to re-evaluate your priorities you'd realize that you're spending all of this time reading a reccommendation for a game instead of giving your life meaning. Why aren't you working out instead? We both know you could use more trips to the gym, I mean, for heaven's sake your pants size has gone up by 2 inches in the last year! What would your mother think? What would God think? Is there really a God? Did he create this game? Did he write this review? Does God work out? I bet you God cheats and gave himself a 6 pack even though he never works out and goes surfing on the beach to pick up all the ladies. Perhaps Stanley saw him one day on the beach and was so jealous that he turned to steroids to make himself equally as buff as God. After only a short month of steroid infused workouts Stanley now has a 6 pack of his own, and although he may no longer be able to have children and is developing man boobs, he is still more accomplished in life than you can ever hope to be. Therefore you should buy this game to learn more about Stanley's life so that you can try to be more like him and maybe one day change the way women look at you, and the way you look at yourself, and to get rid of that double chin, for Christ's sake man its just disgusting! Women don't find that the least bit attractive. And no, keeping magnets in your pocket doesn't make women more attracted to you, only more likely to keep your loose change from falling out of your pockets from those 2inch bigget pants than last year that you've been wearing.

Or do you? This is a impossible to describe game and in one word - unique. Or is it?When you first get into the room with two doors you get into the adventure that is not forgetable. This game is pretty much not about gameplay or anything like it. It is just about the story and how clever the guys behind the curtain are.Yes, it is a clever game. It is so clever that you get this uncomfortable feeling with every step - that you are being trolled. And you can pretty much get trolled with hidden endings or just a narrator. The happy ending is not happy, the sad ending is not sad but every ending is freaking amusing.I dare you not to watch any let's play at all. Do not watch any guide whatsoever prior to buying and playing the game. Trust me - you'll get much more fun this way. This is the game based on your own decisions and your own exploration instead and it gives you rewarding experience afterwards. It is a game of what would happened if The Matrix was created by the Truman Show guys. It is a meta experience yet it makes fun of anything that is meta. It laughs in your face for trying out different approach but than it follows your game. This game took some serious effort and is meant to be consumed first hand.I would recommend this game to everyone who likes a new challange but doesn't want to leave his or her comportable zone. It is for people who simultaneously love and hate this genre of 'storytelling games'. It will amuse you either way because this game is serious about itself but at the same notion mocks itself.

The game is very strange. Completly strange.The narrator is the core idea of the game, because your whole playing gets comments from a narrator. The strange thing now is that you do not have to follow the instructions and if you do not the narrator easily just do not let you play further and simply restarts the game. When you now think, ""The game just restarted. Everything is same as last time."" you completly do not looked what you are buying, because this is The Stanley Parable. And one of the most annoying and strange things about the game is, that your earlier plays affect the world later. One of the next core ideas of the game: You restart it very often and find new ways to annoy the narrator or follow his instructions simply for seeing which other ends this game has. And than if you found a new one you do not even know if that was an ending, but the game in the next run is completly different.For the great but strange ideas the game is very uncommon, which is clearly a positive point if you are annoyed from common games. The negative point is the extremly limited playtime so you play like 4 hours and nearly have all endings.As a conclusion: It is a game for people who do not play very often as you cannot laugh that often about the same joke when hearing it the 10th time. If you want to play games where you play 80 or 160 haunts than this game is not the right choice."

Every single, minute detail in the presentation of this experience speaks volumes to how much it has to offer. At a first glance it seems like a short walking-simulator, but deep within itself it manages to entertain, provoke and teach many things, if one is willing to invest time and attention in it.Those are the three most key words I'd use to describe this masterpiece. It's entertaining, as it contains many, many interpretations of ""the story"" (or lack there of) and, from a purely gamer standpoint, it's amusing to simply explore the small, but rich world of Stanley.Provoking it indeed is, as with almost every single varriation of it's formula, ""The Stanley Parable"" has something to say. A existencial comment on many, many subjects, that manage to be light-spirited through clever written humor. If one is willing to look at what Stanley and his Office represent, the adventures they go on together and what the content of those adventures mean as a symbol, one can spend much time pondering the ideas behind everything. And everything is absolutely, brilliantly polished.Last, but certainly not least: the game teaches. The game teaches about many things, if one is willing to hear it. It's a astounding lesson in game design, with significant notes on how a simple gameplay mechanic can be used in multiple, different ways to achieve interest and evade monotony. But above and beyond this, ""The Stanley Parable"" teaches a lot about risk taking and consequence. That every action has a reasult, that the concepts of ""wrong"" and ""right"" are merely concepts and that ultimately, though a obvious path may seem painted, one can always stray from it, whenever he has the strenght to face the trial of his actions later on.The end is never the end in this marvelous gem, but the true ""ending"" starts with the ""Quit"" button. And that's the most important lesson that is taught. And I mean this in the best possible way.If you play it and you get it, you will see what I mean.I've firmly recommend The Stanley Parable. It's something everyone - and I do mean everyone - needs to see.Notice I've not used the term ""game"" at all in this review. This is intentional, as ""The Stanley Parable"" aspires and achieves being something much more special and grand."

There is a nice sense of humour to the game which made me smile but not laugh out loud. It does some clever things but nothing that blew my mind as much as other people seemed to experience. The game restarts after each ending allowing you to pursue another path however this just leads to no sense of closure and feeling that there should be more to the story. This game is an interesting curiosity and certainly worth a play but I was not as enraptured by it as most other people seem to be. Also don't be fooled by my play time, this game provides about 2 hours entertainment maybe 3 if you are determined to find every feature of the game.

The ability to choose multiple different paths makes the game more fun to explore, and the fact that it doesn't end until you decide to quit means you will be here for a while.This game is truly MASSIVE. You could play the game one hundred times over, leave for a bit, come back and find something completely new that opens up a hundred more possibilities.The narration is likely the best attribute of this game. The calm and witty dialogue that the player listens to throughout the game makes you feel attached to this unseen enigma. Rarely do you see a game that has a character that mocks your human volition, and it is done in such a way that makes me laugh everytime.I can safely say the best part of this game is that pointless Broom Closet. If you need more context, just play the game for yourself and you'll see why.The Stanley Parable is a very intelligent game, and I praise it greatly for that. It's also a very special and meaningful game that describes our freedom to explore and think, and then crush it up into a ball because the narrator is a control freak.Final Verdict. I love this game, and for once, I can't truly explain why. It's not for those that can't handle being mentally dominated, oh no, but if you the smarts and courage to dive in, you will find yourself a very enjoyable game indeed.Final Mark: 5/5"

As to whom is whom, a question like that should be the least of your worries as Stanley's life is looked at sideways, upways, and downward.The Parable is about freedom, freedom to choose, everything from walking, living, and t y p i n g w o r d s.In the end, the genius of Kevin Brightings performance, Davey's story, and William's excellent map creating ccreate a story like no other, because it is about every other story told, and yet, its own singular experience.If my jumbled mess of a review hasn't bought you, or in this case, the game FOR you, then you might not like this game.But if you found this expedition of complete anonimity and faceless facts, then the Stanley Parable is  your cup of generally-British-liquid-refreshment.

The ""Stanley Parable"" game which this a review for in my mind offers little over the original mod, besides the graphics.In this new game, there might be more endings. I however found the voice acting to be inferior to that of the original mod. I also found that after each ending, the next time you would play it would be slightly different. Playing a few times would unlock doors inaccessable before. This forces the player to spend more time playing in order to get to each ending.Moreover, each path you can take in this new game takes significantly longer than in the previous mod. The poor voice acting drowned out by inferior music too loud by default does not help either. So you spend more time finding the less satisfactory endings.I find that this new version offers more quantity over quality. Many of the trims along the walls find it necessary to blur out to cheaper LOD models, due to the high performance issues involved in rendering simple bland hallways. The rooms are much larger, so large in fact that the game finds it necessary to interrupt a high-speed fall to load another level. The game sacrifices immersiveness for large, empty spaces.The voice acting is inferior in this new version. The actors sound less excited, as if they were reading from a script. In the mod, the tones of the voices are better in that they occur at more appropriate times, and with greater depth.Overall, I was disappointed by the game. I expected a great update that took the old Stanley Parable, ramped up what was so great about it, and in the end make the game much more enjoyable and satisfactory. But instead I got a behemoth which sacrifices quality for quantity, selfishlly glorifies itself, and attempts to draw a larger audience for greedy profit. I do not recommend this game."

Sure, there's interaction. Minimalistic, but I suppose being able to go from walking in one straight line to another straight line is indeed a form of ""playing"". Unfortunately, I don't think there's any thoughts or valuable insights that I recieved from this walking simulator that I couldn't have gotten from a well-informed and witty TedTalks video.

Walking down the same halls fifteen or so times, and making a slight variations to hear different quips from the Narrator, which in all honesty, if not for his talent The Stanley Parable would have been unbearable for more than three runs.

It loses it's artistic meaning after a few times, what with the sensation that maybe you do have power (only to have in wrenched away from you in an attempt to get you to look at your decisions from a critical point of view regarding existentialism and all that critical thinking jargo), and the sole motivation was ""What's the narrator going to say this time?""

The game, is, quite simply, a choose-your-own-adventure short story. There are, as far as I have found, fifteen different endings to The Stanley Parable. To fully understand this lovely Parable, one must play nearly every ending, for each one adds on a little bit to the others.Not much is present in gameplay: you use WASD to move, CTRL to crouch, Left Mouse to interact, and the number keys in one scene to proceed textual prompts. However, the ability to choose your path is, in itself, a fantastic gameplay element.There isn't much music either: one song plays once in the entire game, as far as I can tell.The voice acting for the narrator is perfect, the tone is perfect, the story is perfect- perfect, perfect, perfect, perfect, perfect.Really, my only complaint is I think I may have already seen all the game's content in just a few short hours.$14.99/3 hours of gameplay = $4.997/hour = 8.3 cents/minute.Not exactly best money/value ratio. However, I do plan to replay TSP a few more times to look for more endings.For those who have played Antichamber: this game will hurt your head even more if you think about it too much, and try to place its existence and its proposed concepts under logical observation and consideration.

The narration provided by Kevan Brighting is witty, humorous, and often truly ominious. Depending on path you've taken The Narrator can come off as anything from laughably pathetic to absolutely terrifying, while still holding that same charm and humor. Even once you've found all of the ending combinations, there are still many fun things to find and observe with each playthrough. It's also fun to put this game in front of your friends and see what path they follow.

I like being tossed in this game with no tutorial and minimal setting, just building this interesting and hilarious relationship with the narrator. you might catch yourself yelling at your computer, best to play this alone, you might look crazy. If your looking for a multiplayer experience, dont bother. If a straight forward open world adventure is your taste then this might be a bit sour. This is the game you play when you want to play a game where you can spend a few minutes decicding on your path. The dialog never grows old and the endings leave you pondering about the mysteries of the human psyche. If the verbal abuse of GLaDoS fits your fancy, then the narrator does the job perfectly. 9/10"

This game is proving the point that games are undeniably linear. It doesn't matter what you do, it's the end result that almost always is the same. Choices are meaningless. Stanley Parable rejects this, and says ""Make your own decision."" by saying ""Don't make your own decision."" In this game, choices truly matter and you get a drastically different result depending on the simplest of decisions such as going through the left door or the right door.Secondly, if I said anything about the actual game besides the fact you can make the rare interaction with objects and go left right forwards and backwards, it would be a spoiler."

It's neither of those things.The first play through is one of the best gaming experiences I've had. It's clever, witty, fun, interesting and unique. Then the game restarts - you're confused but it was entertaining so you figure there's a good reason to do it all again. Once you play through it again you notice that it isn't 'a different story every time you play, it's the same story except the narrator said some things differently. The game gives you the illusion of control but really provides you with completely linear paths where you either listen to the game or you don't and that's literally the entire game. It's not a game becuase that implies there's some sort of skill involved, this is a choose your own adventure book without that pesky narrative to keep you interested.Overall, brilliant idea that's executed creatively... for about 5 minutes.

You are meant to repeat the journey several times, walking along the same corridors in the hope of finding a new path but after one hour and three endings I honestly lost all desire to do so.And to be honest, unlike GLaDOS, I couldn't find the narrator funny and intriguing, it all just felt over the top and plain intrusive.I am glad I got it at $5 and this has taught me the valuable lesson to careful investigate a game before buying it when the press defines it as 'a piece of art'."

Guide Stanley however you wish, but beware the consqeuences.Personally, I enjoyed The Stanley Parable immensly and highly recommend it to any player who is above playing just blood and guts games.  Although the plot is very linear and repetative, the plot lines are mostly a funny and sometimes sinister, made all the better by the Narrator's witty commentary and surprising reactions.  Although it is worth playing, the game can become a little stale after a while; the creator even said it's possible for a player to beat all the endings within an hour.  I still love it however and would give it an 8/10 for the superb audio track, graphics and gameplay, only underscored by the linearness and once-and-done mentality of the game. While playing, always remeber; let's begin again."

The Stanley Parable's gameplay isn't inherently fun, and at times it can beslightlyboring but it was never enough to really affect my enjoyment of the game. The Stanley Parable gets its charm almost entirely from the clever and humorous narration. Having a British voice passive-aggressively insult you has a strangely appealing nature to it. The game also strongly benefits from its incredibly well established atmosphere, but that didn't have quite as much of an effect on my experience as the wonderful narration. I had a few problems with the game, but there are only two that I feel are worth mentioning. First off, because of the nature of The Stanley Parable's mechanics and design, you're gonna spend a lot of time walking back to places you've previously been. Second, it's not very long. I finished the game with almost nothing left to see in about four and a half hours, and at least an hour of that was re-doing things to make up lost work. That being said, it was a very enjoyable four hours, and it was certantly worth $15.Buy it."

Or do you? These are the kind of questions The Stanely Parable asks. It has its thoughtful moments, its funny moments, even its uneasy moments, but you will likely leave the expeirence with something to think about it.

Others lessons come off as gratuitously upfront, and for good reasons.It's a game by storytellers, for storytellers, featuring a storyteller as the main NPC, and arguably the main character of the story.  And to think he is spending the whole story narrating the day of a faceless, purposefully uninteresting person...However, unless you do things in an order that makes you and empathize with love these minimal characters, you may end up losing some of the darker moments to laughter, due to the blurred line the game draws between laughs and crushing sadness at every opportunity.This game is pure, unfiltered chaotic-neutral energy.

Think of it more as a point-and click adventure/choose your own ending kind of games.Voice acting is really engaging though, making you feel alot like you were in stanley's shoes.Still, you're better off torrenting this game than actually purchasing it, unless you're looking to support the developer. For that default price (15USD), you wouldn't really be getting the best value for your money."

It's charming, funny, witty, ambiguous, smart, saddening, and unsettling in the best and worst ways possible. It's truly an experience to be enjoyed, thought through, and celebrated for it's brilliance in story telling, and place in the world of modern art.Have zero doubts with this game. It's a piece of art that, while speaks softly and bluntly, weaves you a story all video game lovers will related to and love. Coming from someone who's games range from shooters to puzzles, and everything in between, you will love this game regardless of your favourite genre. In order to get the full Stanley Parable experience, one must experience it first hand, preferably alone, and able to take your time with it. It's a tough pill to swallow, but one that will open your eyes to see the choices we both have, and do not have (think of The Matrix).I was pleasently surprised with The Stanley Parable. I found a very unique story, filled with all sorts of tricks, deadpan humour, and was greeted with a very firm slap in the face, as well as a hand that lead me out and in to the game again and again. Simply put, this is not something you should miss out on for the world. Everyone should have a chance to play this game, if not for the incredible plot, than just as a video gamer. Everyone deserves to have this experience at least once in their life."
,Recommended,221910,17569167,"Posted: 16 August, 2015",all,Just Five Minutes,"The problem with reviewing The Stanley Parable is that it is a game that is much easier to write about than it is to make a video about; in The Stanley Parable you spend most of your time running around an office complex, and so it is difficult to put together enough compelling footage for a five-minute video. The Stanley Parable is much more interesting than I make it sound, but any video-review is nevertheless going to be featuring some sweet corridor action.In its first astonishing innovation, The Stanley Parable casts you as Stanley, an office worker who one day notices that everyone in his office has disappeared. Aside from a sociopathic failure to notice the world around him, Stanley is also seemingly afflicted with schizophrenia, his adventure narrated by the only other character in the game, called the Narrator, in The Stanley Parable’s second dizzying innovation, an omnipotent being who comments upon Stanley’s actions as you play through the game.Before I continue with this review, I shall pause for a disclaimer: there is no way of talking about The Stanley Parable without sounding pretentious and wanky. Words like ‘deconstruction’ and ‘interrogate’ and ‘neck-beard’ circle like crows over any writing concerning this game, but the very act of my pointing this fact out lets me get as pretentious as I like so game on.Now that elephant in the room has been acknowledged, I realise that I have been less than accurate in describing the game and we are only in our fourth paragraph. Though you may play from the viewpoint of Stanley, you never play as him. How could you, you madman, you are sitting comfortably at home with Stanley dangling at the end of your puppet-strings. Stanley has a life, and a wife, and something else ending in –ife, and you fling him from irresponsibly-designed freight lifts, you monster!You, the player, are the third and final character, and the game spends a significant amount of time musing on the relationship between players and their avatars, which is rather jolly in a beard-stroke-y way. ‘Choice’, narrative, and even the idea of an ‘ending’ in narrative entertainment are The Stanley Parable’s subject matter, and the game does a very good job discussing these themes in a way that is both entertaining and lucid; the whole idea of ‘a’ story in entertainment is commented upon with the introduction of the patented The Stanley Parable Adventure Line™ and some raucous music and the game does a good job of balancing what could be quite a dull subject with amusing and entertaining moments; humour and wit oozes from every line of dialogue and witty whiteboard doodle, the Narrator character deserves to join the pantheon of video game characters alongside GLADoS and Elizabeth from Bioshock Infinite, and you, as if you weren’t already frantically fumbling for your debit card, get to play Portal and Minecraft in a glorious fourth-wall-smash-y sequence. The environments are well designed (as should be expected really, as the developers wrote an ending in which you can explore the prototype designs for Stanley’s office) and you are always aware of the choices you have made to reach one of the game’s endings, and as a result you know what choices to make next to reach a new ending.While The Stanley Parable is certainly not without its amusing and entertaining moments, they are just that really, moments, interspersed with some top-drawer dialogue undoubtedly, involving what can quite quickly become tedious corridor marathons. The question I asked myself most often as I enjoyed The Stanley Parable’s four-hour run time was ‘Where is the game?’ There are almost none of the activities we have become accustomed to in the last 25 years of videogame development, and the designers have made this decision very deliberately; you do not shoot anyone, there is no HUD display, and, Witcher fans revolt, you can’t have awkward videogame sex with anyone. There are, however, no fetch-quests or escort missions. In fact, absence and lack-ofs are a large part of The Stanley Parable experience; the game will not end, despite my polite requests after hour four of tearing up and down corridors, and while the player is presented with ‘choice’ almost constantly, this choice is proved to be illusory. You will restart the game once you realise that the choice you have made is leading you toward an ending you have already experienced, but the writing makes you understand that even restarting the game is a choice in itself.As an ostensible purveyor of videos and articles that criticise videogames as both art and products for entertainment, I must ask whether I would recommend The Stanley Parable to anyone not interested in the murky waters of videogame narrative. It would undoubtedly give one plenty of street cred to display The Stanley Parable’s achievements in your Steam profile, but as a piece of entertainment that has at best three or four hours of content is paying full price worth it if you are not writing a PhD on videogame narrative?The Stanley Parable is an essay in the form of a computer game, but crucially it knows what it is doing, and, ultimately, is there any better way of illustrating and analysing the characteristics of our chosen medium than through the use of the medium itself? All of the criticisms I have of the game are pre-empted by the game, and to pursue them further would make me seem rather petty and stubborn. While some may argue otherwise, for me the game’s problems are ultimately diffused by it referring to them before I have even noticed, and as such I am left with no choice but to declare The Stanley Parable the perfect videogame, and, in tribute to a game with nineteen endings and so simultaneously no endings at all, refuse to give my review its own logical conc-https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omGaRA0niF8"

It sounds so simple, but get's more complicated once you get past the name.You play as Stanley, a rather ordinary and boring man who works in an office building every day, pushing buttons on his computer's keyboard. But one day he realizes that everyone else in his office has disappeared, and he sets out on a bizarre adventure to find out what happened to them.Everything in this game is based on choice. Whether you follow the story from start to finish, or derail it entirely, it's all down to what you choose.The game is rather impressive, considering it started out as a mod for another game entirely. The whole thing is based on the players choices, which lead down different routes to different possible endings. Finding the endings is entertaining enough, but they aren't the best part of this game.What is the best part you ask? Two words. Actually, a name: Kevan Brighting.Brighting is the voice actor for the narrator, a bodyless voice who...well, narrates. And by god, he makes this game as good as it is. The best thing about this game is hearing Brighting's voice as he reacts to your various choices, sometimes helping you, sometimes insulting you, and sometimes trying to get you killed.The game looks nice enough, and the play is fairly smooth.Warning: If you are a completionist, this game is NOT for you. Not only is it difficult to figure out how to get every ending, but three of the achievments are stupid to get. One requires you to not play the game for five years, one requires you to play for the ENTIRE durration of a Tuesday, and one is called the Impossible Achievment. It's description literally says: You cannot get this achievment. Granted, there are five other achievments that are easy to get by comparison, but those three could give a completionist nightmares.Also, this game isn't worth $15. $5? Yes, but not 15.So it it entertaining, yes, but mostly for Kevan Brighting's voice work. If you decide to get it, I would wait for a sale, and for the love of god, don't become obsessed with getting every achievment. I would also recommend playing the Demo first, so you can get a feel for the game without actually spoiling it for yourself, and decide if it's for you.For myself, I would give it a 7.5/10, but again, mostly because of Brighting. So I recommend it, but only provisionally.But in the end, whether you get it or not...is your choice."

After a stimulating walk through a bizzarely empty office space, Stanley had to make a choice.Left or right? Left or right? Left or right? Left or right? Left or right? Left or right? Left or right?Stanley's brain was on overload. The instructions told him left, but the right just seemed so appealing. What if he finally did something on his own?So Stanley went his own way and eventually 'beat' the game,' or did he?Nontheless, Stanley went to sleep that day rather peacefully.But as the weeks went on Stanley began to wonder if there was something more, something he didn't see.It couldn't possibly be however, games are quite limited.Night passed night as Stanley began having nightmares, twisting in his sleep, waking up in the middle of the night sweating profusely, screaming! He couldn't take it he had to.... he had to....Stanley knew what he had to do.So Stanley went to his computer and played. And he played so more. And he played so more.And then he finally found every ending in the game, or so he thought.How could the internet possibly know EVERY ending?And so he searched, and searched, and searched for hours.This is the story of Stanley: an ordinary office worker driven to insanity in his search for another ending to a game that probably doesn't have another.But he will continue even after finishing this review because, well, he was happy he could make his own decisions in a game, or could he?What if this game was actually linear?NO.NO.NO.NO.NO.NO.It couldn't be.Stanley needed help.He took pills.He didn't sleep.He quit work.He didn't eat or drink.In fact Stanley played so hard his computer exploded.Stanley stared at the dead computer for another few hours.Stanley was finished.But the game wasn't.There was only one way to end the game.The police found his body early the next morning with warning post-it reading: ""Don't play the Stanley Parable""But of course, they did.And so the cycle continued with player 2.And so I must tell you, don't play this game!The seduction of the choice to play is getting to you isn't it?Go ahead, play.Play like Stanley.I don't care.Either way, it's all part of the plan.Fourth wall moment: this game is the greatest thing ever, don't play with a guide and play multiple times trust me!

Take another hit, bruh. Thats  META. Soo META maaan.) that all they've built is a mess that players trudge through pretending they're gaining some kind of deep insight about the meaning of choice, and then talking about how earth-shatteringly amazing the experience was with their friends because they don't want to be the one who ""doesn't get it"".

And that's pretty much it.I've finished the game and got (almost) all of the achievements in under an hour (I've decided not to pursue one, you'll know which one), and I don't feel any need to replay it at all."

One of the things that everyone can agree with is that this game should never be spoiled to anyone, because the experience itself is what makes the game so endearing, so I am not going to spoil anything. But I will say that the game isn't very interactive, all of its appeal comes from the dialogue and how to get to set dialogue sequences, so this game isn't for everyone, and keep that in mind when you are playing it, also the demo and the half life 2 mod itself gives you a very good idea of what to expect, so I would play either of those two first and see if you like it."

Two first-person paths diverged once back in the 90s, one leading to Doom and the other to Myst. Whereas the former led down to a fairly well-known and successful business model only possible through this medium, the other led down to this mod-made-game and odd philosophy sometimes best experienced for oneself, and solely through this medium. This is the most off-the-wall study in level design any gamer and/or would-be developer should undergo, and it is also one of the most interesting, introspective stories to come out of the medium as a whole. Maybe not quite what anyone expects to represent ""our medium"" as its focus is not addiction, but perhaps a means towards passing wisdom to others, creating spaces to learn and experience things. Absolutely necessary for everybody who's played too many games and for those who haven't played a game at all."

That is exaclty what kind of game this is. It is very intelligent, philisophical, witty, very humours, pokes fun at the modern day hum-drum of what office life/corporate world is thought to be like. The voice acting in this game is amazing. Kevan Brighting does a superb job of bring the witty pompous british narrator. As a note, I don't know if anyone felt this, but the game did feel a bit Portal-esque, based on the how the story is told, and few navigational gameplay mechanics. I don't want to give anything away, because this is quite the unique experience, and I don't believe you can even get anywhere closee to the same experience really, by watching a Let's Play.

I was very excited when I bought the game and expected great things from it. Contrary to my expectations, I found The Stanley Parable empty and pointless. Sure, there are a lot of different endings that encourages replayability but the very short length of the games makes them meaningless. You can reach an ""ending"" in a matter of minutes. In fact besides a troll ending where you push a button for 4 hours, all other endings can be achieved in less than 20 minutes. They shouldn’t be considered ""endings"" at all. An ending should only be achievable after hours and hours of gameplay not by walking around for 10 minutes.Alternate endings are not a new feature in games introduced by this game. They have been around since I can remember. Furthermore, this game was relatively easy to make since there no gameplay mechanics rather than walking around. In fact if you are a fan of such games, I highly recommend better games such as the Vanishing of Ethan Carter, the Wolf Among Us and many more."

Don't let this make you think that the object of the game is to somehow look around for clues to solve this mystery, it's not quite as exciting as that. The Stanley Parable is like playing a narrative where the only story you hear is ten different readings of the same introduction.The pessimism isn't aside just yet, it is more just a game where you are a character that wanders around an office. The narrator will tell you what to do, and you can either listen to him or ignore him. With every decision, there are new things. However, these 'new things' aren't always particularly exciting and cause the game to restart instantly, making you look for a new ending. This, I suppose, is the catch to the game.On the plus side, that little catch is exactly what makes it entertaining for the first few hours. It provokes intruige about how the game is so unique, and after you have finished being disappointed that it's a bit different to your expectations of a 'narrative', you can explore the routes that the developers have implemented, albeit the routes are fairly close-ended.On the whole, an entertaining game that challenges what makes a game popular, and destroys expectations on your typical video game narrative. A good one for the philosophers, too. Worth the money? Quite possibly, but it's one of those games you can't decide if you wasted your money until you have adapted your own take on the game. It doesn't follow any genre stereotypes as such and so it is like marmite in the video game world. Buy full price at your own risk, but it's a game probably best left until Steam sales."

If sale price points were closer to $5 i would be more inclined to reccomend it but as it is $15 (or $9 on its average sale) is just a little too steep for what you get.

Don't get me wrong, the Stanley Parable is absolutely amazing when it comes to it's wittiness, creativity and narration without spoiling anything! But I found myself quickly growing tired of the humor and trying to find a new story path to go down after about two hours of exploration, but maybe that's because I suffer from depression or something. Essentially I did enjoy the Stanley Parable in the short time that I played it but for a game like this with such a varied gameplay time for each individual gamer (even with maybe five hours to do EVERYTHING) it should be no more than $4.99 at regular price. This game really only has a lasting affect on the player once and maybe again if a significant amount of time has passed so that one does not remember the same paths they took and funny endings they witnessed in the game. I reccommend getting a group of friends together to pay and play this game since it is not worth the full asking price of $14.99 for one person."

He is leading through the game, his voice being rather nice in my opinion. If you have a sense for a kind of.. black humor, if you enjoy exploring, to test your limits - ""this game"" is worth a try. At least try the demo. It's rather hilarious. And...restart ;)"

At the core, it is a meta-narrative about the linear nature of video games, and how interactive experiences are shaped by the simulation of choice and freedom. Unfortunately, it fails to meet even that criteria, as its self-deprecating humour cripples it from ever making a bold statement on the way games should be designed. The game openly admits that The Stanley Parable is a bad game, when it could be asking the audience to be self-aware about the manipulative nature of their favourite games.That aside, this game is drastically overrated by professional game designers and critics, who hail this as one of the best games of the year, and an example for big companies. To me, this is outrageous. It's not because the game is boring; if anything, The Stanley Parable is supposed prove how games are inherently boring. The worst part of The Stanley Parable is how forgetable it is. And considering how small the game is for $15, that's just unacceptable. Don't buy it."

Alright enough of the silliness, I'm actually going to review this game.Where to begin, well, I guess I'll start with the story.It starts with the narrator of the game (get used to him too, not like he's annoying or anything, anyways) saying that this is a story about a man named ""Stanley"" and that he's Employee #427 of an unknown company and his job is to push buttons that show up on a monitor showing how to push them and in what order. The narrator also says that he enjoys his job and relishes every moment of it, and Stanley ""was happy"". Then one day, something ""peculier happened, something that would forever change Stanley. He'd been sitting in front of his desk for hours when not a single order had appeared on the monitor."" Then he stands up and we finally get to talk about the gameplay!So, it controls much like any first person exploration game, WASD to move, mouse to look around, click to interact, everything checks out so far. But here's the twist. Anything the narrator says you to do is all up to you. I won't spoil too much, but basically it's all up to you. The game has many endings to discover.Overall, I give this game a 9/10. Yeah there's not much in terms of gameplay, but it gives you just enough to warrant multiple playthroughs."

Then I watched a video on the original mod of the game.All in all, I probably spent around 7-8 hours in a row obsessed with this game. Not because I'm a completionist, but because it is so interesting!I'm very glad that I bought the game too, even though I ended up watching videos anyway.

,Not Recommended,221910,8700464,"Posted: 13 January, 2014",all,BreadWave-kun,"The only reason I don't recommend The Stanley Parable is the oficial ending.Really. You are very interested in what the narrator says, you discover the hidden truth of the company, you get off the machine and finally be free. Stanley can be happy with that, but not me. There are many things I will never know and may never know, which disappointed me greatly. To begin...How the narrator achievement get everyone out of the building and why he chose you for turn off the machine? How does he know you? Because it is clear that he did all this for you, in fact, he gets very upset when you ignore. Which leads to wonder. You really can trust him? What tells you that with him things will be different?And worst of all is where it ends. Think about it, you're inside a building in a city (if you take the ending in Stanley gets crazy, he collapses on a street) and suddenly a path to a house and a green meadow unfolds before you. Does that make any sense to you? For example Portal 2 has a similar end, but you know that Aperture Science is underground so it is very reasonable for an elevator to take you a cornfield. Here the end has less meaning than that of Mass Effect 3 (before they try to fix the huge plot holes).If you want to play The Stanley Parable, YOU DON'T OBEY THE NARRATOR. You can get to laugh or surprise situations that cause (you can even hear a little music on your adventure).So you avoid getting the ""official ending"" of the game and have fun doing anger the narrator."

The game was incredibly fun and had a great sense of humour, and when I thought I'd found everything, there was always something new I could discover. The narration is spot-on, since it perfectly gives atmosphere to the game - which normally would seem empty. The narrator himself is very talented too, since throughout the story, he conveys a superbly wide range of emotions, from sinister to desperate.But, like any other game, it doesn't come without its' problems. The game feels very empty at times, especially when there isn't any narration. This is very clear during the ""Broom Closet Ending"" sequence, which could've been improved if the narrator was more chatty at times and there weren't such huge spaces between his dialogue. Also, the graphics have seen better days. The texture details for alot of the models are just horrendous. For a game made in 2014, it's not  exactly impressive.The gameplay is very minimal - with only WASD for movement and E for interaction (by default), hell, there isn't even a jump button! What makes this even more depressing is the fact that the game acknowledges this design flaw and makes an achievement out of it. Also, pointing out your problems doesn't make them better. I very much enjoyed the forth wall jokes in the ""Madness Ending"", but it later occurred to me that they never fixed the problems (for example, adding feet models or a proper walking perspective change), but just pointed them out comically. It's like looking at a crippled comedian making jokes about his missing feet. Yes it's funny at the time, but it's just sad when you think back about the experience.This game has gotten ALOT of flak, many ironically calling it a ""Walking Simulator"". It's lack of proper gameplay is apparent, but it's narrative and humour definitely carries the game through though. Still, some more content would've been nice - maybe some rewards or even a proper story - instead of just going through different ""endings"". Overall, I doubt this game is a ""Walking Simulator"", it definitely knows itself that it's very ♥♥♥♥♥♥ at simulating walking - for sure. Instead, I'd call this a ""Collect-All-The-Endings-athon"", since thats all you can really do. I cannot deny that there was alot of effort that went into this game, but come on guys, I need more bang for my buck/£2.99!Score: 4.27/10Pros:Definitely worth sale price.Incredibly funnyVery talented narratorLots of secrets and alternate endings to findCons:Often feels very empty at times.No true proper storyGraphics are awfulLacking in gameplay and controlsBecomes a chore to play through at timesVery much more fun to watch than to play"

It is a very intriguing mystery about what happened to Stanley's co-workers and changes quickly to other plots during different paths.Narration - 10/10The narrator fills the space of noise and keeps the game from feeling like a horror game, in my opinion. He is constantly talking and keeping you involved in walking around.Humor - 10/10The narrator is constantly making jokes about everything, including a broom closet. The jokes never seem to fall short of amazingly excellent. Many things besides the narrator contain absolutely hilarious moments, as well.Content - 9/10There are many different paths to take and many different endings to witness and it will take a long time to play through all of them. But once you end up seeing all the endings in the game, there is nothing else to really do.Music/Sound - 10/10The music is ambient and barely noticeable and isn't even present during the whole game. But, it's there when it needs to be and fits the tone of the game very well. There are sounds for most of your interactions and it also fills the space of no noise.Total - 98/100I absolutely loved this game when it first came out and had so much content I had yet to witness."

If you do care, keep in mind that you don't have to agree with me. I'm just sharing my thoughts, after playing the game in hopes of enlightening potential buyers. If you disagree with me strongly, find some means of politely contacting me and we can have a proper discussion on the matter. Okay, now to the review.The Stanley Parable is a very enjoyable game. I'm gald that I played it, because it does everything that it was aiming to do (as far as I can tell), and does it well. The narration is pleasent to listen to as well as outrageously funny, the game looks fairly decent, and there is an obvious attention to detail in everything it has. The team that worked on  making this piece obviously enjoyed the result of their labor. If you don't buy this game, you should at least keep an eye out for future releases by this team, because they've earned the attention of the video game community and its consumers.Now, here's why I don't reccomend this game. Don't get me wrong, I loved it, I loved it very much. It will hold a special place in my mind for quite some time, and has invoked some serious thinking on my part. It's rare that a videogame does such a thing, and that makes it all the more great. The only downside is that, while the end never really is the end in this game...there is an end...Not in a plot sense, more an enjoyment sense. I spent the good part of a day playing this game, going through all of the paths I could, but there are only so many. I looked up to see if I missed any at the end of my playthrough, and I haven't. I did all of them, and it only took a day.I'm in no way saying this is a bad thing, because I'm sure that if they tried to do to many paths, the game wouldn't be as good. It's just...the game has little to no replay value. You do everything, and that's it. No point in replaying if you know what's going to happen. Sure, it's funny, but even watching the same stand up twice gets a bit old. You should definitely get this game, just at a different time.All in all, I made this extremely lengthy review just to say that the game costs too much for it's content. Sorry for the read. I got this during a winter sale for about $5 and it feels too high. Just wait until it's rather cheap, then the pay will be worthwhile.Thanks for reading. Have a good one."

As soon as I downloded this hallmark of beauty and everything that is embedded into the soul, the entire game was shifted to the left. It was magnificent, how I could barely even mouse over to the option menu to open it and fix this problem. But, oh boy, I was not prepared for the next 1 hour and 30 something minutes trying to solve the nest crap-shoot. The problem of inadvertently changing the video so that my monitor could not function and all I scould see was a pitch black screen. It wasn't frozen my dear readers, for I could still hear adio and even hear my mouse shift over the many different option texts.So began my quest to solving this...this... ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of a problem. I reset the game, reset steam, reset my computer, searched on google or some sort of answer to unf**king Stanley Parable. I undownloaded the game and reinstalled it but to no avavil. Unfortunatly, it was time for something I dreaded from the begining... I had to change my video settings while not able to see the screen ( I know I know, unimaginable. However, I discovered an ingenious way to make this as painless as possible)I used F12It was foolproof; just use the screenshot function to know where my cursor was in the game and then I could just Alt+Esc to then view those screenshots and actually see what the hell I was doing.It was a neck-breaking, spine-tingling, sweat-enducing 1990 point and click adventure in an otherwise thought envoking game.

Interesting concept, but only takes a couple hours to find the vast majority of endings (they're all let downs).  Simply go through each permutation of obeying or not obeying.Example, if you do what the narrator tells you at each choice, the game is over in about 5 minutes.  If you don't do what he says at every choice, it takes a little longer.So you can construct a decison tree:obey, obey, obey, disobey = blowupobey, obey, obey, obey = go outsideobey, obey, disobey, disobey = and on and on till you run out of permutationsAlong the way there's a couple oddball endings you stumble onto because the opening changes.So outside of some extremely hard to find endings that you'll essentially need to use a guide for (the window, the sv_cheats business, and I never found the pod till I read about it), this game is formulaic, and has little replay value (because you replay it about 30 times the first time you sit down)Paid nine bucks on sale for a video game to mock that I would bother spending time on it.  And now I'm truely ashamed that I did."

By constrast, the unexpected and zany expressions here ARE the story and thus do have meaning, and so I found myself quite enjoying it.You can experience just about all there is to it in about four hours or so.

The narrator is hilarious and even after over an hour of trying different things it never got tedious.Tip: use the save function when you find what you think is a key branch!  I didn't notice it was there for a while, but finding that makes it so that you can play the branches without replaying other parts repeatedly.There's a limit to how much I want to say about what actually happens.  Yes this is a ""walking simulator,"" but it's full of choice and those choices can lead to some really surprising avenues.You won't spend more than 5 hours on this, if even that (I have around an 3 hours on it at the time of this writing, counting offline time), but the experience itself is fun and memorable enough that it is worth its price."

,Recommended,221910,8292064,"Posted: 26 December, 2013",all,norinemu,"I've played many games that build themselves around questioning the narrative framework of games. Some of those games were too ""artsy"" - they gloried in their artificial depth, waving their hands as they said, ""What is this game REALLY about? This? This? NO ONE KNOWS!"" Some of the games were just confusing- what were they trying to DO, anyway? And some of them just felt disappointing- their attempts at breaking down the barriers of narrative failed to satisfy.The Stanley Parable defies those problems.It is one of the best explorations of breaking down game narrative I have ever played.The game is best described as an experience, one that made me think, wonder, laugh, and feel. It is clever, witty, and finely honed. In some ways I thought it was almost too to-the-point- I wished that I could have messed more with the environment. Nonetheless, the game lacks bloat and that is greatly to its credit. This sort of exploration can wear thin very quickly when it goes too long.This does mean that the game is short- in a couple hours I saw the majority of the known endings to the game. Had the game been $5 or so I likely would not have thought much of it. At $15, though, I felt like it was a bit overpriced. Still, it's cheaper than some movie theaters, and a far better experience than going to watch, say, American Pie 43: Why Are We Still Making Movies? I recommend waiting for a sale if you are worried about getting your money's worth, but I cannot stress enough that this is a game experience I think you should have.People ask if games are art.I think this one is."

I don't hate or love it, I just think it's okay.What is the Stanley Parable? Well, it's a first-person walk-arounder with a humorous but sinister Narrator commenting on your every move, which of course made me think of Portal. But the Stanley parable isn't really Portal. I mean, obviously it hasn't got Portal-style puzzles, but the story and the way the story develops aren't very Portal-like either.The game begins in Stanley's office, with the Narrator explaining that Stanley's job is to sit at a computer all day. The Computer tells him to press certain buttons, and he does.Leaving Stanley's office, you walk through a linear corridor as the Narrator comments on what you do and explains Stanley's thoughts. For a while everything the Narrator says is appropriate, because all you can do is walk down a linear path.But eventually you come to a room with two doors instead of just one.""Stanley,"" the Narrator says, ""Walked through the door on the left""Which door do you go through?The entire game is pretty much a brilliant meditation on what that one moment means to game design, and that's where my problem with it lies. Because it's an amazing, pretty and thoughtful meditation on video game design, but that's _all_ it's about.And I was expecting more; from the things in the trailer, the sinister corporate office, the banks of invasive cameras, the sinister figure of the Narrator controlling things, I thought the game was going to address something outside of how we feel about video games, something like free will or corporate behavior or our place in society, but in practice those things are mostly red herrings, used to comment on video game design, and the small feints the game makes towards other subjects are, in my opinion, not terribly moving or effective.In a way it's actually the anti-Portal: Portal starts out seeming like nothing but a series of abstract, plotless puzzles, but it brilliantly reveals itself to be something much more concrete and narrative. The Stanley Parable starts out seeming like a story of a man trapped in a surreal and dangerous corporate office, and brilliantly reveals itself to be something much more abstract and plotless.Incidentally the writing is very funny and the visual design is brilliant.Basically, if you want to make video games, or write critically about them, this game is mandatory.But if you just want to play video games, it's funny and odd enough that I still recommend it, but I'd wait for a sale."

The whole story and the innovative style of playing has me playing the game over and over in the race to find the most endings and the most easter eggs and all the hidden secrets there is to be found in The Stanley Parable. I have been waiting for this game for about a year or 2 and I have been amazed on all the improvements the Devs have made and all the tiny little details they made just makes the game seem as if it expects all of the little paths the player might take. For example, if you happen to jump out of the window in the office you can find an alternate ending where the narrator sings and asks you if you liked this alternate ending. In my opinion, that is what makes the game so addicting and so amazing along with the new style of play. I recommend this game to all of the fans of the original mod or even to people who have doubts on this game because I can assure you, it's well worth the $15.00 it is to play this outstanding game!"

The narrator was very well voiced and his humorous responses to the player are very fun.  Even the achivements are funny for this game.  It also as a lot of replay value to see how things changed based on your actions.  It is also a lot of fun trying to troll the narrator back despite he is just a voice in the game.

What will you do?The game is constructed quite seamlessly in the Source engine, with brilliant writing delivered to your ears in what can only be described as Shakespearean eloquence by Kevan Brighting.Recommended if you enjoy reflecting on the nature of choice amidst your pointless, mortal existence. Which is something everyone should do at least once in their short, irrelevant lifetime."

Also, when I got to the boss's office, I could not type in the code, which was annoying.

You don't need any skills, nor there is a way to fail or die. You just make decisions, and the story taylors around them leading you to one of many different endings.You can notice this game was made by a videogame/movies enthusiast, as it uses all the typical resources you've already seen a million times...and mocks them.Story and Narration are over the top. And that's proven by the fact that there's a constant narrator and you never get sick of him. He also has some of the best lines I've ever heard on a videogame, and  also the funniests.It also takes you out of your comfort zone frecuently.

It's video irony, and the joke is on you for playing.This is the story of Stanley, who witnessed the end of video games and didn't know what to do with himself.  Mostly he heard a disembodied voice in his head telling him what to do.  And mostly, Stanley died in a number of unfortunate ways.  Even when he lived, he basically died.  Since he just returned to that point in time where there were no more video games.And you, the gamer, are an even bigger loser than Stanley is.  Why?  Because Stanley is the result of a creative process... an intellectual activity that crafted irony from nothing and breathed life into it with controls, graphics, and a story of some sort.  You just occupy Stanley's body, drag him around uselessly up one cooridor and down another, all toward certain death.  And when you get to one of the end conditions, you post about it on Facebook.  But really, you are just pushing buttons at the mercy of someone else's creativity.   Oh, and you paid actual money for this.  Money that you probably earned actually doing something creative and interesting; something that added value for other people.  Or maybe your mom gave you the money.   And she did something creative and valuable to earn it.  But you are just going to sit listlessly at your desk, pushing buttons the narrator tells you to push.  Or the ones he doesn't tell you to push.  And none of it matters one bit.  Not at all.Loved this game.... it is literature and social commentary turned into a video game.  Bravo!"

As a deconstruction of narrative in video games the term Parable feels more appropriate once you have discovered the point behind the experience.Then it becomes a hunt to find all of the choices, secrets and oddities hidden away. I have 9 of the 10 acheivements because the acheivements are part of the meta-narrative as well.If you find the idea of narrative in games an interesting topic, then this is for you. If you are willing to experiment to discover the point anyway, even if you aren't interested in narrative, it is still a good romp. Recommended."

I was very surprised to read later that this is exactly what TSP used to be in the beginning - it felt trully HL2 with the turqoise doors and white handles.My first playthrough lasted for less than 10 minutes, since I did exactly what the narrator told me to - subconsciously. This triggered quite an interesting discussion in my head. Why had I blindly followed what the computer told me to do? Hence, I think the beauty of TSP is not about the experience itself, rather the questions it forces you to ask.But seriously, few games have made me feel more like a lab rat running through the maze for a piece of cheese - with the exception of Masters of the Universe and its endless grinding.I recommend this game as a valuable experience for all hardcore gamers, but I would suggest waiting for a sale.

The Demo isn't part of the real game, but it will help you get a sense of what the actual game will be like.Essentially, it is the video game equivalence to a Choose-Your-Own-Adventure Book. As you play through the game, you are able to make choices that take the story in a new direction. Each choice takes you to a different ending in the game. There are plenty of endings, all of which are unique and hilarious. Finding all of them drives you to explore.The really isn't much more I can say. The Stanley Parable is an amazing experience.

At first it wasn’t what i expected, but then it was, but then it left me unsure. I wouldn’t recommend this game to someone who really likes serious plot driven games, but i would recommend this to someone who likes little fun/quirky games.I hope you enjoy it & please read till the end!First Play ThroughThis game is really good if you just want to kill some time. I went into this game thinking that it had a very detailed plot, hoping for a Portal-like experience. I was hoping that you (Stanley, but sometimes not Stanley) would be combating the narrator, trying to escape the facility to find civilization. It certainly does set it up that way of course. At the start of the game, the narrator informs Stanley that all of the his coworkers are gone and Stanley leaves his office in search of answers. Once you leave, you see the office is a mess and that the further you go, you still see no one in the office.The music sets the mood as it sounds eery and intense. I almost feel like I set myself up by reading the game description because I started to fear what was going to come next and what the narrator would say. I read that Stanley would have choices, and not have one at the same time. My heart truly pounded as I would be given an order, and I’d go against it, just to see what would happen. Therefore, when given with the first choice I thought was presented to me (the go through the left or right door) I went through the right, then defied the voice again when it told me to get back to business and to take the first door on the left. That lead me to what seemed like a jump puzzle, and what started to look like the first true sign of the combative behavior between Stanley & the Narrator. I was even more excited after I got to Stanley’s apartment, and was greeted with a GLADoS like joke (the fake wife). I was eager to see where it would take me, but it only made me restart the game. So I did in hopes that this time, something would happen according to the plot.Second Play ThroughSo this time, I decided to listen to the narrator because I really wanted to get to the plot already. (You know when you really get excited about something, so you just want to make it happen?) So I listened, I walked through the meeting room, up the stairs, into the bosses room, and into the elevator. After we landed on the bottom floor, I started getting that feeling again like something awesome was going to happen, and then I saw the blood smeared “Escape” sign near the mind control facility (where he wanted you to go to). I once again defied the narrator and ran down the dark hallway. The narrator then kept telling me to turn around and that only death lied ahead, but I believed he was just trying to manipulate me, but no. Stanley comes face to face with what seemed like the GLADoS & Cake conveyor belt scene. I was frantically trying to jump or do something to get the hell out of there, but to no end. When it came time for Stanley to get crushed by the metal walls, he dropped down onto a metal bridge, and walks into a museum of the game. Honestly, I thought that this was Stanley’s heaven or at least this was how the creators decided to make the death look like. I wandered around, looking at the different items and info panels, I was pretty impressed. As I began to make my way out, I heard a woman talking, telling Stanley about the battle between him and the voice. I got excited again. Maybe this led to something! I ran through the door and it put me right back into the pod to get crushed. Stanley died and the game restarted…..again.Third Play ThroughOkay, I really started to get♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off at this point. (So was the narrator, he started to just tell me what to do and had a “blah blah blah” thing going on) I went back through it all and ended back in front of the mind control facility. I walked in and saw the screens that covered the walls, and found that excitement once again. I listened this time to just get done with it. I was tired of restarting. I wanted to know what was going on. Where the employees went and what Stanley had to do. I listened to the voice and went into the Mind Control Facility and turned it off. I was hoping that it would malfunction, or that you would be stopped before getting there. That maybe the antagonist would be there, but after you turn it off. The game is….over. Like really. That’s it. That’s how you “beat” the game. You just, turn it off…you justTURN. IT. OFF.YOU JUST TURN IT OFF! WTF?! WHAT! I was♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ I got the achievement and started the game over just to go back and try something else. ThisCOULD NOTBE IT.Fourth Play Though (the last one that mattered)All in all, I restarted this game like 15 times. However this was the last one that really sunk this game in for me. I restarted the game this time with the idea that “instead of shutting it down, I’ll just TURN IT ON! YEAH! THAT’S GOT TO BE IT!” So I did. I turned it on, heard the GLADoS like banter, and he informed me that I actually armed nuclear warheads. He said I had 2 minutes before they would go off. With that in mind, I raced to try and turn off the nuke activation. I ran from button to button, screen to screen, and nothing was working. I was getting so aggravated! Then he started talking, saying that he thought it was funny how hard I was trying to stop it, how I was trying to beat the game. After the 2 minutes had passed, the facility exploded and I sat there, in my chair, staring at the black screen. I was done. So done in fact that I just sat there. I stared at that screen and that was when it started to make sense. He was right. He had ALWAYS been right. Stanley had no where to go and nothing to do in his life but to take orders from someone. STANLEY COULD NOT LIVE HIS OWN LIFE, and the SAME thing could be said about the player. The player is given the idea that at some point they HAVE control, but you don’t and you never did. Just like Stanley, you were being told what to do and even if you went against it, you were still under his control. He NEEDED someone to tell him what to do! The game wasn’t a game at all. The only thing being played - is YOU. You play a game trying to find meaning, when the meaning was given to you during the intro. Stanley had the same job, doing the same thing, and he was content. When Stanley lost the one who told him what to do, Stanley couldn’t function. It was hard to see it, but after f*ck up after f*ck up, you are finally forced to realize this truth for yourself.This is a game about a person playing a game, trying to make the game a game.I know, just breath.After this I continued to play just as a “What the heck” kind of thing. I found ending after ending, and grew to love the game for its wit and confusion. I grew to appreciate the fact that the developing team did everything they could to deceive you into having simple fun. They just kind of broke you down over time.So therefore, if you like playing casual games (not necessarily looking for a plot) I totally recommend this game.Final SayPros:Not too demandingBreath of fresh (aggravating) airDiverseHilariously confusingMakes you want to play again and againCons:Expectations aren’t quite metAfter you find all the endings, there is little to no replay valueCan become boringOriginally the game is $14.99 on Steam, but I got it during the Steam sale for $3.49. I don’t really think it’s worth the $15.If you play, let me know how it goes. I’d love to hear some feedback about it. All in all I thought it was fun and interesting, but it’s something to play just cause. Like Animal Crossing or something.Hope you all enjoyed it & thanks for reading!Check out my tumblr/twitter/FB for more reviews!"

No, best to play it straight.Stanley Parable is a metastory that will not only play with your mind,but your heart.  Even as the narratortortured, killed, exploded, or insulted you in other lifetimesyou will still be moved by him in others.  We will be confused with you, sad with you, happy with you, and it will kill you to do what has to be done,I've spoken of emotions, but it is hard to elaborate without spoilers.   But let me go on to say that I have never felt so attached to aballoon.  It wasn't just a red fellow with a face drawn on,  It was my friend!  Brilliantly written, superbly cast!I was shocked, even dismayed whenthe one human being you meet in the game turns out to be animitronic.  looking back, I know that you should never trust a salesman even if the narrator builds him up to have been living in the ducts for years, living off of beans and coffee.In the end the Stanley Parable is a game that must be played, and then after it's played, must become a part of your way of thinking about the world forever.A message for those who have played the game:There is one true ending!

Your guide has the familiarity of GLaDOS but with enough difference to make his company a welcomed experience. Until it's not. But again, spoilers.If you're not completely convinced by the screenshots or videos, then play the demo and then play the demo again after you've played the game to catch its subtleties.Five out of five for me."

Do morality and choice have any bearing at all on each other when ones limited choices are restricted to the confines of a finite prefabricated world whose inhabitants lack both the ability to make decisions and the capacity to evaluate objectively the probable true motives behind the decision (getting the ""good"" ending or the ""bad"" ending to justify a second playthrough, to feel clever for illiciting a more interesting response from an NPC or just because theres a ""body looting"" mechanic in the game and the NPC has a nice weapon, etc). The Stanley Parable is a game that can be easity completed in under 5 minutes. Game beat, Achievement got. But take a look at the achievements available before you begin. Youll quickly realize that a couple of them are apparently obtainable before leaving the room outside your starting office. Give them a try.

You can beat the game in a few minutes if you really want to but it's the different choices that keep you playing. The narrator was in my opinion the best part of the game. He reminds me of the Hitchhikers Guide To the Galaxy narrator with his accent and humor. Half of my play time was simply to get the achievements as those in themselves are more challenging than the game. Some of the are quite ingenious.

This game focuses around employee 427 who is also a man named Stanley. Stanley works for an unknown company and he just does his job every day. Until one day, something wasn't right. So you, the player have to make Stanley go through all of the choices in this game. Speaking of choice, that is all this game is about, choice. But it also about the narrator in some of the endings. Speaking of endings, there are actually 19 endings. All are great. Some are happy and some are sad.In my opinion, this game is the source engine at it's best.

All of the reviews raved about how ""Immersive"" this game was and how it was this amazingly well made game. I had no care for it. I bought into these reviews and spent money that I now want back. This game was not what I was expecting when I bought it. The way it sounded and the voice actor in it (Which is it's only redeeming factor) made me feel like it was a ""Portal 2"" esk game. But I was saddly wronged. It took me two and a half hours to get through the SO MANY DIFFERENT (sarcasm) options that the game allowed you to go on. I can honestly say with full confidence that this was my least favorite game that I have played in a long time.I know a lot of people are naming it the ""Best Indie-Game 2013"" but this is my personal opinion. There are other games out there that do a better job with the Indie platform and Stanley Parable wasn't even close to being on that same list as others."

Not only because of the narrator, but also because of the atmosphere, the silliness, the quirks. The amazing amount of endings and the back and forth of your actions and the narrator's words are amazing. I kind of refer to it as ""the most passive-aggressive game of all time."""

If you are the same as me, I suggest this game.

It will take your full attention and it’s worth it! Here are the reasons why.As you start to play, you are told by the narrator that you're Stanley, employee number 427, whose job is to press buttons displayed on his monitor. But that day, when you get up from your work station you quickly notice that none of your co-workers are in the office today. You then start to walk in the deserted offices trying to find out what is going on, and the narrator's voice enters to give you directions. There’s a narration system but The Stanley Parable let you choose your own path, each one of your decision will open new choices, your call to obey or disobey to the narrator.As a gamer, something I enjoy the most in gaming is to choose my way to play. The main thing that differentiates our media from movies is the concept of choice. And this is exactly what The Stanley Parable is about. Choose your path, your experience will not be like any other. One of the greatest moment I lived with the game was after making incoherent choices, ashort cliplaunched and explained me what a meaningful choice is. What the heck, that game let me choose and then tells me I could do better?!!The setting chosen, a random office adds a lot of absurdity to the mix. In The Stanley Parable, playing is working. The main character (you) is never happier when being told what to do by others, and you need to press buttons to declare “I love you” to your wife. The thematic visited here are interesting and relate to the AAA video games likeCall of Dutywhere you need to press a command to perform an action during an impactful moment.To conclude, The Stanley Parable is about the journey not the destination. If you feel like experiencing something different, give the demo a try. You might like it or hate it, in any case you’d experience a unique game!"

And it's here where it really shines.One critical aspect of all adventure games is plot and dialogue. Here the plot is as mysterious as you could imagine, and the narrator perplexity in what you do funny as well. After a while, you just enjoy the simple act of doing the opposite of what you are supposed to do, exercing free will, enjoying a strange feeling of agency even if it leads to the brutal death of the brave Stanley.The game even reach the point of developing beyond the Stranger than Fiction plot (if you happen to know the movie) for a moment of sheer delight.Really, The Stanley Parable does something powerful in the game world : instead of being a little of everything that works in different genres (like Incredibles Adventures of Van Helsing), it does not try to be strong where it's weak and focuses all its strengh on what it's great at!And the developers should be praised for that :)"

To be fair, it lacks a few features that are so common in videogames nowadays, but it in no way detracts from the game. The voice acting is superb, the choices are genuinely interesting and have had me play through endings a fair few times to see what could have changed (and I'm by no means finished with it). If you're looking at this right now; go buy it. If you're a little less weathy, wait until it is on special, then buy it.

Apparently this has some sort of concurrent hidden meaning with regards to the nature of gaming however I didn't find it as funny as others apart from a couple of jokes. I would say, a different form of satire.I was hoping it was more of a story rather than an exploration of the futility of gaming, but that's just me."

You can get that feeling a number of ways... when something is exhilarating, creepy, eerie, amazing, or thought provoking just to name a few. But, that feeling isn't all that common with most people.I had that feeling MANY times throughout my 6 hour experience with The Stanley Parable tonight and I have only seen maybe half of the endings the game has to offer. It often came when I would enter a new unexplored part of the game that I had not previously been to. I played with nice headphones on in the dark by myself as I feel so many of these good thought provoking games should be played to get the FULL experience of what they have to offer.I will say that I went through the game once and thought to myself ""okay that was funny and interesting, but a bit of a letdown and a bit short for the price tag."" It wasn't until I explored further after my first play through that I really saw the true BEAUTY in the game and realized there would have to be many more hours put into the game to find all it has to offer.I'm an experienced gamer, but have not played many point and click first person games at all. This was a great way to get into them. I have also never had such an appreciation for the narration in a game. This is a game you can show to your friends and have them sit down and try it. Sure the strictly COD players might be bored not being able to shoot anyone, but I think most will at least see the genius and creativity even just playing for a few minutes. I won't take more of your time and won't give anything away, but do yourself a favor and instead of getting that expensive pasta dish for dinner grab a sandwich from the fridge, throw $15 down for the game, mellow yourself out in whatever way you choose and sit down with this game one night.

Dont act like its a real choice hell you dont know what your getting into if you choose right or left your just choosing randomly. But either way your mind gets blown. Most likely.

There are multiple story branches you can take to find various different endings...and sometimes you quite accidentally take a path you've taken before.And instead of having an option to go, ""whoops! Go back!"" or ""Whoops! Get on with it!"", you are forced to sit through some very long exposition, complete the same puzzles again, and finally get to a place where you might make a new decision...or wind up ending the game and having to start over.Were it not for that, this game would be completely, 100% stellar, completely worth it.

There are a ton of videos/guides/whatever, but it's just ""that"" game that makes you want to avoid spoilers. The story is that you play as a man name Stanley who is in his work office. He presses buttons on his computer, but suddenly the orders stop coming in. Stanley goes out of his office, and discovers no one was there. ""That's it? That's the whole story?"" I hear you ask. Not exactly. In this game, YOU make the story. You choose whatever you want to do, and if you want to control everyone with mind control, that's what you do. If you want to press a button for 4 hours, that's what you can do. There are so many different endings to this game, and it is very fun trying to find them all. Reaching the endings can take either 4 minutes, or at longest 16. That's how short they are, so the whole game is more around finding the endings than playing the whole game. The best part, however, is probably the Narrator. He says what Stanley is SUPPOSED to do, and if you follow him, you get the best ending. However, you can disobey him and go in other directions, and that's part of the fun of the game. He gets angrier and angrier as you go the wrong way, but you can have a good laugh at that.

The narrator is extremelly talented and never fail to bring you with him in the story. The second narrator appearing in one ending is also good even though she barely talk. Since the narration of this game is the most important feature of the game, it was really important that he was good.II.Contenta.GameplayThe gameplay is really basic, you just walk through point A to point B, checking an ellement from time to time.What is really important is that at every step of the way you have to make choices, they constitue the base of the game.b.WrittingJust like I said the game is all about your choices, every choice lead to a different path and somthing like twenty endings. Every choice gives to the narrator the opportunity to react often in a comical way, making the impact of your choice even more important. Even if the game don't give any information, evolution of its two characters, it's the whole message behind the story that is important, the very meaning of the ""adventure"" of Stanley. Is everything real ? Am I in control of everything ? Why am I doing this ? The writting is clearly good but sadly everything can be done is about three hours (+ four for one of the ending).III.Othersa.Replay ValueSadly, I wish I could say the game could be replayed as much as you want but it lose its impact on you when you discover all the ends, no surprise, no meaning in the disobedience since you know what is going to happen. I think it's really an unique experience that can really be felt once (or when you forgot about the whole game in years ?)b.AchievementsThe Stanley Parable gives you 10 achievements particularly hard to get. If some are funny to get like ""Clic on door 430 five times"", some are really useless and annoying to get (even tho two of them can be achieve by changing the time on your computer) still it's particularly annoying for people that wants to collect achievements.c.PriceI will be honnest, no 12€ is not a good price for a three hours experience, no, 9.99€ is still not an honest price. The game is good but it honestly worth it's -75% price on sale or max 5€.Please if you want to get it, WAIT FOR THE SALES, honestly buying it full price is a waste of money.IV.Pros and ConsProsConsGreat Narrator and DevellopementReally enjoyable the first timeFunnyNo replay valueAchivements annoying to getToo High priceConclusion★★★✩✩"

However I pretty much saw all of what can be seen, both by playing the game (90%) and watching some easter eggs and the art ending on Youtube (10%). I didn't give a meaningful score to The Stanley Parable, because The Stanley Parable isn't a game: it's an interactive statement regarding (mostly but not only) gaming narrative. It's basically a very well thought thesis, only it's not written in words, but with code; a thesis built around paradoxes and illogicalities, such as the clearly and purposedly paradoxical main ending, the one you reach following the narrator's instructions step by step, resulting in the only outcome permitting Stanley to obtain freedom. However there are also paradoxes created unwillingly by the developer: the Unachievable Achievement, something you literally can't achieve in game if not in a completely random way, with the developer changing the way the random process worked with each patch, ended up becoming the only real and practical achievement of the game when gamers collaborated in real life to find a way to activate it through cheating, something that ended up being very difficult in and on itself, as the developer had tried to block cheating in many ways."

In some ways when you think the game has restarted, it only is continuing to mess with your mind.

Things won't make a whole lot of sense at first, but the more you play and explore and wander 'off the beaten path' the more you will end up discovering.You play as Stanley, a drone among a seeming mass of other like-minded drones; only he 'awakens' one day to realize he is all alone. His fellow drones (i.e. co-workers) have seemingly abandoned him... or at the very least disappeared mysteriously. Thus begins Stanley's adventure. Of course, how long said adventure lasts and what it entails is entirely up to you - you the Player, not you the Stanley - and the disembodied narrator who will inevitably try to guide you along his own intended path.This is a game that's all about choice and it changes on the fly to reflect said choices. Will you mindlessly obey like a good drone, or will you seek your own path? Will you be content with mind-numbing happiness or will you seek out the hard answers left waiting in the dark recesses of your own mind?"

There is no levelling up, and no action.On the surface.Beyond that unremarkable shell lies a truly amazing tale of self-examination, driven by a narrator that is at times funny, at times rude or aloof, at others heart-breakingly pitiful and endearing.Playing The Stanley Parable is ultimately like enjoying a fine wine: it is a layered, subtle progression towards an end that is different with every taste. It's like slogging through a long book only to discover a marvellous conclusion that redefines your views.The Stanley Parable is the only game I have ever played that made me seriously question whether I should stop gaming or continue.

I will not be going into The Stanley Parable paradoxes, but they are brilliant. The Stanley Parable follows a unique genre which laughs at videogames in general. The main message is that no matter what open world you have, no matter how many choices you can make, there are key milestones, which result in absolutely any game being liner. And you know what? The Stanley Parable is liner too, and this is only a small portion of the endless paradoxes that you may encounter while playing The Stanley Parable.In summary, The Stanley Parable is a brilliant game, which will be either loved or hated. Narrator is just hilarious, but check the demo first to ensure that you actually like this type of humour.This game probably has the best collection of easter eggs and achievements that I have ever seen.

The fact is that 'game' is a definition that is still up in the air, and we refer to these multimedia experiences as such only due to lack of a better term. We've used it since the seventies to define this medium, and everyone is content to agree its a catch all for what is an industry that now encompasses just as many sub-genres as music or film.This isn't a game for everyone, and not everyone will value it in the same way, in fact some people have been offended by the games narrator and taken personal offence.Which makes me want to redefine this as art, because it obviously has an effect on people, and has caused massive amounts of conversation around it.I think that if you are truly going to enjoy this title, you need to not take yourself too seriously, because to be honest the narrators and makers take pot shots at the entire industry, even at themselves.In this sense it reminds me of great stand up comic, it's a parody, it takes the things we know all too well, boils them down, a pokes fun at them. It does so in a way that is inoffensive, playful, and meant to inspire rather than provoke.On a technical level I would like to just say that they have done quite a bit of cool stuff within SDK. Hell just getting an asset into Source is a nightmare, and this game is polished.The presentation of the remake really is consistent, it's diverse and teeters into the surreal as heck quite a bit. The effects on show(loved them particle effects), are subtle, but impressive and really pull it all together.The real strength of this game/experience is the story though, and this is voice acting at its finest.The energy, emotion, and believability of the narrator is incredible, and if you want proof of this look no further then at how much controversy it has caused.People feel a true connection with the narrator, they either laugh along, or get horribly offended. Both signs that they've done a stand up job.To wrap up I'd like to say that its really hard to quantify this game, really hard to provide examples of why the people who are fans love it so much.Partly because its really not in any one genre, and partly because you really cant talk about specifics without ruining the experience.All in all though, this game is going down in my list of all time favourites. I really cant wait to see what they make next, and hope they have nothing but success.I'd on a personal note like to extend a thank you to the devs also(like they need my praise).This was one of the games, and changes in the industry that made me take a pipe dream from the shelf, and realise that with enough tenacity and elbow grease it was attainable, and got to work.I really felt this game spoke to me personally, and inspired me to start on a life journey of poverty, poor nutritional choices, lots of caffiene, late nights, no social life, and constant study.I'm happier than I have ever been, and live for trial and error, and the eureka moments that come after. :PI'm pretty sure anyone working toward or within this industry knows what I'm talking about.So thats what I think about The Stanley Parable, I hope their next game is just as thought provoking, divisive, and surreal.Thanks for all the fish chaps."

The Stanley Parable sets out to do something very rare in this day and age of gaming; to challenge your perceptions of gaming and provoke a deep level of introspection that kept me coming back for more.This game screws with your head big time, on your first playthroughs you'll be scratching your head at moments, thinking that you've finally got it all figured out, then be back to scratching your head again with a deep paranoia that every one of your actions and 'decisions' has just been something you have been steered towards and in no way an expression of free will.It all sounds very abstract, and it is. If you're the kind of person who likes herp derp shooty kerpow funtimes then this probably won't be for you, but if you want to be genuinely challenged by a game in a way beyond ""Left click to shoot, don't left click to not shoot"" then you'll have an intriguing time."

I still find it hilarious throughout the whole however-many-hours-you-decide-to-put-into-it of play time, but there just weren't as many variables as I'd hoped for there to be.Of course, it's an indie title with full, very well written and narrated voice acting. So there's credits to that.Then, the whole... game?... is a very heavily branched visual tour through the perspective of Stanley, so there is no -real- game play. I am not criticising it though, because game play is not what the developers are aiming to achieve here obviously.So the whole... game?... boils down to doing things for the sake of seeing what might happen. Which is why I find it a little disappointing in that the... game?... does not seem to offer as many variables as the environment can offer. Some of the things that you CAN do are quite ridiculous though, and I'll give props to the devs for going as far as to narrate these events that realisticly speaking probably only 0.0000001% of the players would attempt.In all, The Stanley Parable is a very unique experience that I would recommend to grab on sale rather than full price.

The Stanley Parable is about many, many things - at least, until it decides it isn't about anything at all. Quite often in the same moment. The Stanley Parable gives you power, and then it takes that power away without a second thought or a moment’s notice or hesitation. The Stanley Parable is a game made up of little moments.Let's begin again.The Stanley Parable is a first-person game. It fits into no other genre beyond that. It gives you the trappings you need to play, and no more. You can walk, you can crouch, and you can interact with what is required of you. You cannot jump, there is no action to speak of, and you have no weapons. Except, perhaps, for the choices you make. The Stanley Parable then takes away all of your perceived power, and taunts you mercilessly as you helplessly flail around an endless loop of rooms with no hope of ever escaping. And then you wake up.Let's begin again.The Stanley Parable is a game about story. The Stanley Parable winks and giggles and points and laughs at you from behind the screens. It never lets you forget that you are experiencing a story, a contrivance, a wild flight of fancy. Yet there is no story. It never lets you forget that, while you are the player, it is the puppet master pulling your strings. Every choice you make, The Stanley Parable changes. Every deviation, every action against what has been planned out for you, and every act of rebellion alters something. You can go against the designated path, but you will pay the consequences. They may be a simple change in path, a painted line leading you back towards the intended direction, or a fatal meeting with a bottomless pit. There is no way of knowing for sure what will happen when you choose to go your own way.Let's begin again.The Stanley Parable is about Stanley. Stanley. ...Stanley. .....Stanley.. Stanley....Stanley..Let's begin again.The Stanley Parable is a giant, combat-free choose-your-own-adventure book. There are countless choices and secrets to be found that branch the story off into unseen directions at any given moment. A faceless narrator guides your path the entire trip. An omniscient conductor for the ride you're currently on. He is a prankster, guide, villain, victim, and all other roles that need to be played. He is simultaneously your greatest friend and your worst enemy. Whatever role he embodies, he's fantastic. He'll make you feel rage, sadness, joy, wonder, excitement, and so much more. He'll even cause you to pause and take a moment to think. At one point, he tasked me with answering a phone. I subsequently tripped over the cord, unplugging the phone and altering the outcome of the choice and the story. As a result, the narrator was heartbroken that I interrupted his tale and he made me feel very sorry for him with his reaction to it. He is a main driving force behind the entire game. He is the man behind the curtain. The many, many curtains.Let’s begin again.The Stanley Parable is never-ending, but always over. Each time you reach a new ending, or a thread unravels with you starting back at the beginning, you may feel like you’re moving closer to seeing everything the game has to offer. But you would be wrong. There is always something more to be found, and that’s the beauty of the game. You will stumble across secrets so entirely accidentally that you may not even notice anything has changed. Yet everything will have changed. While treading familiar ground can get tiresome, that moment of discovery when you notice something is different is a wonderful feeling. Suddenly the narration is given in different words. A new door suddenly opens before you. Excitement grows, the path moves into new territory, you begin to feel joy at having made a new discovery – and then it’s over. Perhaps you meet a brutal end at the hands of a conveyor belt leading to bone-pulverizing crushers, or perhaps you have found freedom in a sudden path that opens up into a bright, sunny - Minecraft?! Oh dear. Well, by now you know what happens next.Let’s begin again.What you are experiencing with this review is the very heart of The Stanley Parable. And it’s just the beginning. It’s hope that you are reaching an ending, and then being thrust back to the beginning. It’s annoyance that you keep encountering another new instance that thrusts you back to another beginning. It’s hidden meanings, subtleties, irritation, and joy. It’s suffering, but rewarding. The Stanley Parable is contrast, and it is uniformity. The one constant is entertainment. If you enjoy it, you will continue to enjoy it. If you don’t? Well, it’s understandable. It’s not a game for everyone and it doesn’t pretend to be. You’ll move on and never look back, and no one would ever blame you. Least of all The Stanley Parable itself.Let’s begin again.This is a game that enthralled my entire family while playing. A five year old, a twelve year old, and a 28 year old were completely engrossed in watching the game being played. It is hard to describe how rare it is that this family sits still long enough to watch a movie together, let alone to watch a game such as this being played. The Stanley Parable bridges the divide between generational gaps as effortlessly as it crawls into the deepest recesses of your brain and sticks there until you can’t help but return again, and again, and again.. The Stanley Parable loves you, and The Stanley Parable hates you. But most of all? The Stanley Parable needs you to make a choice. That’s all The Stanley Parable will ever ask of you. It’s friendly like that.Having finished this review, I’m off to begin again.."

It neither provoked nor gave me any insight into lifes eternal struggle for freedom or whatever pseudo intellectual guff I've heard people ascribe to the game.For a 10 buck ""mouse lab"" puzzle it delivers about 6 bucks worth of entertainment.I don't like being annoyed in games.

Taking the role of the titular Stanley, the player must explore their office complex after all of their co-workers have disappeared. Accompanying the player is the Narrator who frequently discusses the situation and gives the player instructions.It is when the player is given the opportunity to go against the Narrator's will that the Stanley Parable's charm begins to shine. The Narrator is a witty, humerous and occasionally meanacing force that makes the game stand out. When discussing the Stanley Parable, it is the Narrator that people first talk about.The gameplay is uncomplicated, requiring the player to explore the office complex from a first person perspective. Other than that, the only other gameplay mechanic is choice: do you listen to the Narrator or do you ignore him? There are several choices to be made with many different combinations which all equate to a game with multiple endings, each more polarising than the last. The time it can take to reach one of these endings varies but no matter which one you have, the game is incredibly short.Most of the Stanley Parable's endings could be witnessed through just over an hour of gameplay. If you are a player who wants to rack up a lot of time played for their money then you may question whether the Stanley Parable is worth the asking price. In this case you are presented with a choice: if you want a lengthy game filled with action then the Stanley Parable may leave you disappointed. If you want a game that is intricate in design, full of charm and highly replayable then the Stanley Parable will most likely suit you. It is a matter of quality over quantity."

However, the gameplay becomes repetitive after that and you have to repeat several things before each story line. The story line is supposed to be the thing that makes you think in this game about a false sense of comfort in games and breaking out from the video game world. Half of this resonated with me while the other half did not at all.If video game designers made endless and infinite choices, games would never end which is bad for the developer and the player.Other than story and funny dialougue, this game has nothing to offer. This game isn't a video game, it is a social commentary you pay for. I feel as if i can find more thought provoking detail in newspapers with similar fun level. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed a certain amount of the funny and sarcastic dialougue and (SPOILER SORT OF UNTIL THE END OF THIS SENTENCE) deep comments about the nature of people going to the same job every day.You can honestly go on youtube and see ALL of the content that the stanley parable has to offer with the exception of a very small amount of dialougue reserved for repeat playthroughs in about an hour and a half. I wish i had just done that.Over all, this game has its moments but it is just too short. I don't think I have ever, in the history of my gaming career, spent my money on a game that had such little content for its asking price. Also, this was with me completeing EVERY ending and alll of the achievements (which devs made really annoying to get as a ""social commentary""). After completing this game, I felt ripped off even for the discounted price of $10 that i paid for it. The criticial praise and people praising this game is expected because it suggests making seemingly ""dangerous"" comments about the way society works and has some witty commentary. I think this praise was completely unwarranted because the game was half-fun, half-made me think, but full price. If this game were $4, i might have thought it worth my money.In the end, I would not reccomend this game unless you could care less about your money and would prefer wasting your money on this game rather than putting it towards a more worthwhile title. Despite the praise and reviews you may read, this game really doesn't have enough content."

I wouldn't call it immersive, because it shoots for meta. (Take, for example, the Broom Closet Ending, which is a self-referential conversation the narrator has with himself when you stand in the broom closet too long.) By the end, I think it suffered because of the comedic aspect, but I enjoyed it. There were very few puzzles, so you spend most of the time listening to the narrator and doing (or not doing) what he says, just to get a reaction. You replay sections multiple times, and he becomes as agitated as you. He plays tricks on you. You mess with him. You become buddies.

I laughed my head off, but I'm not sure whether it was at the game itself or at people who didn't get it!Kevan Brighting's Fry-alicious voice acting is not to be missed."

I found it quite Monty Python-esque in a way.  The voice acting is superb; in fact, I would say the game pretty much relies on it for its impact.  However, if it had been John Cleese telling me: ""Stanley was so bad at following directions it was a wonder he had not been fired yet"" then it would have been too much to bear.  It would have been awesome."

He knew the right door leads to caffeteria, but he went here anyway.""Game cost you few €. But that feel of rebelion with Narator-priceles.According game rules, don´t buy this game. But it would be pitty, its awesome ;)."

Haven't replayed it alone but it's great to play on a big screen with friends who are unfamiliar with the game and to watch their reactions to the outcome of each choice. You can take turns playing as Stanley or vote on which choice to make. Perfect for a completionist. The game is rather short though, but I have always been a fan of good narrative. Especially of the sarcastic, witty kind."

If you can get it cheap, maybe at like 5$ maximum, its more than worth it; But frankly, doesn't have the length or content to warrant over 10$.  Fun idea, nice narration, clever commentary, but not really a game in the classic context."

While many may say it is repetetive, I disagree. Yes, you have to play the game over and over, but what makes this game fun are the choices you must make. The game adapts to your choices and shows you a different ending based on what you choose. There are so many different paths its hard to stop playing. I highly reccomend this game."
