76561198030080447,Recommended,222140,11792775,"Posted: 20 August, 2014",all,PrinzEugen,"Puddle is a puzzle-platform game that makes clever use of advanced physics to let you move all kinds of liquids through different obstacle courses. While the idea itself sounds rather straightforward, the execution is certainly not. The first levels, using water as a liquid, are not too difficult and I thought ""tihs game is going to be a piece of cake"". But how wrong I was (am actually). Difficulty goes up steeply and the developers have really thought of all kinds of possible liquid and obstacles to make life ever more difficult. Water, oil, goo, fertilizer, nitroglycerine, all pass the review and all ask for a different approach. This keeps the game interesting, since the visual context changes accordingly to the liquid being processed. And since the visuals are really outstanding for an in essence static background, the developers have done a good job.But after a couple of hours, my interest in the game diminished since I got tired of the trial-and-error which seemed to be necessary in some of the later levels. So I let the game rest for a couple of weeks, and picked it up again recently. Now I pick up some levels ad random and try to get more of the Steam achievements, which are a clever addition to the game. All in all, this game is a nice sideway away from any larger-scale gaming projects, but don't expect anything more really. If Steam reviews would have a ""neutral"" option, this one would get one. But in the end I give it a ""thumbs up"", if only for an original idea being well executed, with a lot of love for the project being involved.Gameplay: 17/30 (interesting at first, but too difficult after a time)Graphcis: 16/20Sound: 5/10Longelivety: 5/10Technical/stability: 16/20Personal appreciation: 5/10Overall: 64/100"

Get those instead, and save yourself a headache."

This makes an interesting story to follow.The game has several kind of liquids, each one with different characteristics like viscosity and velocity over different surfaces.A negative point is the lack of controllability. You can only tilt your screen to the left or right and this give you low control of the fluids.Some levels can be very frustrating because you have to memorize the entire level in order to complete it. But that's not so difficult to do it.There are very interesting achievements to unlock. The most difficult one is to earn all 48 gold medals. This requires you to finish all levels carrying as much fluid as you can on the lowest possible time."

Each map should have at least one check point so you players don't have to start all over again. There should also be the ability to move the camera to look around what's coming next instead of doing trial and error every 10 seconds. The difficulty in the maps is very not linear. Some are super hard while others are fair. The ability to skip a few maps is vital for the game.The most fun liquid was the molten metal but there was too little usage of the hardening property. Nitroglycerin was fun too but should have more use of it's unique property. The scrap yard maps and the body maps were the hardest.If there was to be a sequel I would like to see acid that corrodes stuff, water that needs to be frozen to ice at certain sitations, magnetic liquid, mercury and non-newtonian liquid. There could be maps with other liquids on which the player's liquid floats upon like oil on water."

I've already finished nearly half of the levels in a little over two hours (and I am sure some of that was time away from my computer or watching something momentarially-as lately I have been watching YouTube in the background.I say 'finished' half of the levels because some, if not many of them I didn't even rank in. I have more copper than silver and more 'check marks' (i.e. finished, but did not rank) than gold (and likely silver).But the poor 'what exactly do I need to do to rank copper, silver or gold, isn't really the problem... anyone can figure that out after playing a level a few times... no, the problem I found is that in the labratory levels, specifically playing Nitroglycerin, if you start the second level of without directly beating the prior-and even then sometimes-your will immediately explode, restart the level and repeat. Even that can be a simple error in coding, not spawning the liquid correctly, or the game assuming the liquid is moving too quickly as it 'jumps' into existance... but when you get to the Body levels, and specifically the blood levels I constantly get a divide by zero warning. This doesn't crash the game, but it does freeze it until I 'windows key' out and click 'ok'.I haven't gotten past these levels yet, as I fet it inportant to add this to a review. If you are programming anything you really NEED to make sure you don't have code divide by zero. Usually it will completely crash software (ah, the blue screens of old), and I'm not entirely sure how this software is able to cope with it.The game looks finished and even polished, until you reach the bugs that clearly show it is not. It is still fun to play, and for those who feel the need to get gold on everything you'll have a challenge... but they really needed to go over their software and make sure things worked correctly, each time, for all hardware.(A FYI, I'm on an HP Pavillion 7000, with Intel I7 and nVidia GeForce 630M, running WIndows 7--so it isn't like I'm trying to run the game on obscure hardware or software).EDIT: So, I've had to 'skip' some levels... Space is hard, and the level just before also has the divide by zero error..."

It's just one of those games that doesn't draw much - if any - attention. 'Impulsive' is a word most of us will recognize here. Myself included. Before playing I had no idea what this game was all about. 'Why ?', I keep asking myself. Because this game is great fun.Essentially Puddle is a platformer game where instead of a character you control multiple fluids (sticky, explosive, you name it). You know the drill; getting from point A to B. But there are switches to be flipped, fluids to be split and more, and you have to tactically move your fluid because if the fluid get below a certain amount it's game over. Some of the later levels can be truly frustrating, but at the same time fun and, in a way, relaxing.It looks great in motion, I truly adore the artwork. It's simple, yet sophisticated and colorful. Just check out the screenshots and you know what I mean. The sound effects get the job done, in a realistic way. It's what you'd expect.To all my fellow impulse-buyers; please do check out this game. You won't regret it, I'm pretty sure (that's right; not 100% :P).[Rating: 78/100]"

You control it by tilting the screen, but the degree of tilt is quite small.  Levels are mostly about memorisation and trial&error gameplay.There are some interesting ideas, where your various liquids do different things (such as a weedkiller working its way through plant life).  A more patient player than I would probably enjoy it."
76561198140299850,Recommended,222140,14666837,"Posted: 26 February, 2015",all,foofaraw,"If I wanted to suggest a game that would appeal to the widest range of players, from small child to the disabled to a brilliant adult engineer or gamer, it would be Puddle.If you love to watch fluids flow, from coffee to rocket fuel or decomposed rat (yes, rat rot) and just have fun making them flow in strange, interesting or even funny ways, this game can be JUST that simple. And if you reach a level where more demands are made, and the player is unwilling to commit intellectually, they can take one of four “whines” (two whines on “extreme” skill level) in order to skip that difficult level. Each category grows more challenging as it progresses, and each group is VERY different from the preceding one. Each fluid flows differently, and is affected by factors such as fire or consumption by carnivorous plants (though gratefully not on the same level.) A glass globe filled with water must be handled with great delicacy, as must nitroglycerin, both in the Laboratory section. (But it may also be necessary to CAUSE small amounts of the nitro to detonate to proceed. Or to sacrifice fluids to make a branch break to facilitate a pathway, or destroy a container to free a fluid to flow. Such skills are a bit beyond the “small child” level.) Some fluids are highly flammable, but can also be extinguished if action is taken quickly. Sometimes “winning” may consist of sending a flaming mass of liquid pouring quickly over the finish line (though not likely with a high score).For those seeking an intellectual challenge on an intensely scientific level, this game is just a little slice of heaven. While in its simplest form this game is simply gravity acting upon fluids, Puddle vastly exceeds the simple. Anyone not familiar and comfortable with the phrase “water seeks its own level” may find themselves at a severe disadvantage, but understanding Newton’s laws of motion is REALLY helpful. Ultimately, as there are only two buttons, there are also two goals: get as much of the original fluid mass to the finish line as quickly as possible. If the constantly monitored fluid level drops below a preset amount, you lose. If it doesn’t, you WIN! What you win is gold, silver, copper, or simply completion. The scoring is given in the form of a rather sophisticated graph where the meeting points of the two measured variables are displayed in comparison to the three award levels. Players are also informed if their score is a new record.It takes skill and intelligence to use the force of gravity alone to keep the fluid in a compact mass, especially when it’s gravity trying to spread it out and break it into separate droplets. On several game levels that may be helpful, on others, the deal breaker. Some fluids, such as water, slosh about and need to be “damped” (as is done with the swinging weight hanging from an overhead crane.) Often trailing bits of fluid must to sacrificed so that the leading mass isn’t slowed as it crosses flame, or other reductive forces. Knowing that science will help the trailing fluid to move faster, thus pushing the slowly moving leading fluid quickly over a destructive force is often critical. So is trusting that momentum will keep fluid moving uphill if direction is changed as early as possible, helping the full mass end up downhill faster than if you waited. The real challenge in this game is trimming milliseconds off the time, and adding the tinniest fraction of a drop to the mass by speeding it along instead of waiting that extra tenth of a second.For many disabled or impaired players, this game is “perfectly” simple. All that’s required for play are the left and right arrow keys to tilt the world displayed onscreen (though split-second timing can be VERY crucial in many levels.) I have played exclusively on the Mac version, and Puddle does not appear to have adaptability for colorblind players. The game is very nearly photo-real with a wide range of colors, and the fluids themselves often change color during play. I can’t speak for how this might be an issue for the “color-impaired”.There are some issues with Puddle. If your fluid gets broken into several masses, the camera may ignore the one needed for completion. I’ve had to manually close games when I was unable to even know where the remaining fluid was, much less maneuver it effectively. On my Mac the mouse is useless in the menus. The menus themselves need LOTS of work. It would also be nice if the score you were trying to beat was shown in some way on the score screen, or better still, in the graph. To see what scoring you’ve achieved on each level takes several steps more than could possibly be necessary. Some levels (Human Body: Tension & Stout Hearted) are FAR more difficult and cumbersome, bordering on impossible, on my Mac than what I’ve seen on YouTube.All in all, the BEST $2.49 I’ve ever spent on a game in my life. I expect to be playing this game for quite some time to come."
,Recommended,222140,16139096,"Posted: 2 June, 2015",all,Serieus,"Puddle is a physics platforming game.  But instead of controlling a character, in the standard sense, your character is a liquid.  You control water, molten metal, coffee, and many other different types of liquids that all come with their special attributes.  The levels themselves range from super simple to super difficult, however, finishing the latter levels is not as difficult if you are not aiming for gold medals on all runs.  Achievement hunters, beware!  This game is very difficult to beat and achieve 100%.  I'd definitely recommend this game for that shear fact that it's original, it's beautiful rendered and the varying levels and liquids offer ever changing gameplay environments.  Definitely worth it if you find it at 50% or more."

You may lose liquid by virtue of it just being off screen with the overly zoomed in camera - Which you do not seem to be able to control.All of the liquid behaves like goo, it is slow moving and has ridiculous velocity. You can never move the liquid fast enough to be satisfying or to convincingly act like reality. The latter complaint is arguably not important as realism in Puddle's arcadey context is never a requirement but the slow and unrealistic physics movement seems to be a cover up of the game's incredibly short levels.This game may not be new and therefore cannot be fairly judged with today's standards, but it hasn't aged well and just feels like a crappy mobile port with good graphical polish.A game that gives a number of 'whines' allowing the player to skip a level while insulting my intelligence with crappy controls and camera is a load of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.Final ""word""Sucks/10"

Not only liquids so it diversifies the gameplay. Not for easily disgusted and non-patient people. For physics lovers. Worth 8$. I highly recommend.Here's Puddle, a game I found during the Paris's sales. At first, maybe it's hard to decide whether or not to buy it. I mean, you only tilt the screen to the left and right, moving liquids, but this game is incredibly... incredible! So yes, this is a ""I go from this point to another"" game, but you don't directly control what you lead to the end.Let me explain myself. Basically, you control a liquid by tilting the screen to the left and right (I think this game was first designed for mobile). Sounds boring, uh? Well destroy this thought right now. Not only are the graphics awesome to my eyes, but the every liquids are different and this creates unique and diversified gameplay. You have coffee, ink, lava, even a liquid that doesn't fall from the top to the bottom but... from the bottom to the top! Some are heavy and falls quickly, some are compact and stick to stuff, some explode... I couldn't even name all the particularities off the top of my head, there are so much! And I haven't even finished the game while I'm writing this!However, people that are easily disgusted shouldn't play this. The body chapter made me slightly wince and I myself am someone that is not easily disgusted by this kind of stuff. The following chapter is the sewers and ain't really better. Also, if you're not patient, unless you want to start to be patient, this is not really a game you should be looking for. However, if you're ready to spend a chunk of your time on difficult levels, go on. The game offers to use ""Whines"" to skip levels but you know, I want to keep my honor and not use them to be proud to say ""I completed all the Puddle levels""...About being patient, some levels are special sometimes, and also harder. They usually are at the beginning and end of every chapters. There, you don't always control liquids but most of the time, there always are liquids involved. One time you control a souvenir ball where the liquid is inside the ball, another time you control lasers and need not to burn the liquid in addition of doing something else at the same time to finish the level... Consider those levels as introductions and bosses. I really like the idea.If I revise everything, Puddle has reaaaally simple controls but the particularities of the liquids make the gameplay unique every time. Also, you don't always control liquids, so it diversifies the way to play. But of you're not patient and easily disgusted it's not the game for you. If you're a fanatic of physics, however, you should like it.I really recommend this game. Worth 8$. Could've been 5$, but 8$ is alright too."

But so many things are wrong here.Gameplay-wise, all you can do is tilt your screen left and right. Which gives you minor control over the liquids. I hate that the automatic camera is going down the path so fast, causing you to lose your liquid just because it's out of your view. It sucks. I wish I had more control over the liquids' movement. Also, many liquids aren't working in the game like they'd work in real life. For example, water, coffee etc are too goo-ey and slow. You'd expect them to go must faster. I'd call them ""imaginary liquids"" because I feel like there's was not much research done about the actual physics of the liquids.I bought it because it looked fun and pretty in the videos. But due to this frustrating gameplay I am not able to reach the final stages. It's not trash though. But it's the kind of game that will sit and rot in your library. Whether you should buy it or not depends on your patience.I really love the art, and the music though. All those little sciency details and jokes are fun.

It's a not that typical indie game, it's challenging, have a fast pace, it's finally a real fun! This is a sole indie title I played till the credits since a long time.In this game, as you can see in the trailer, you control the liquid. The only method of control is to tilt a world a little. Basically the tilt creates a height difference between the liquid and the ground and the former accelerates due to gravity. You can use a keyboard arrow keys, but I personally recommend a gamepad triggers. So, you use just two keys to progress through the whole game.The game's world is divided to several chapters, which consists of number of levels. Each chapter represent a visually and aesthetically differing surround and the type of liquid you control in it. In some chapters you have different types of liquid in different levels. You starting at Watercourse with a coffee, proceeding as a water, then going to the Nursery transforming into weed killer (Sodium chlorate + copper oxide), become a fertilizer, travelling to the Laboratory, where the liquid turns into a hydrocarbon, oil, nytroglycerine, fruit juice + technecium solution... Human Body, Sewers, Rocket, Foundry, Nuclear Power Station at last! Each type of liquid has it's unique properties, water freezes and evaporates, nytroglycerine explodes when handled without a care and lava hardens when it's far from the heat source. The gravity in zero-gravity zone is actually zero, but in the centrifuge at the nuclear station with tremendous radiation levels the gravity alters after short distance travelled. You need to adapt you reflexes and to reinvent controls patterns with almost every new world's and liquid's conditions introduced in the game. And that's really fun.For me, the most funny part was a human body chapter. It starts like a real anatomically true human body but quickly you realize, that this 'body' has nothing to do with it's real world representation. The game's 'human body' is abstract as hell. As a chapter climax, your liquid get absorbed into the circulatory system, the view gets zoomed to 500x and you find youself in a blood cappilary system. You barely can control such a microscopic amounts of substances by tilting the world, so your gamepad's triggers, being rhythmically pushed one after another, pumps the blood and your precious solution of juice and technecium, which some fool drank, will jerkily flow through the capillaries. The fun is massive.Seems like game developers had a lot of ideas and that's great they realised a good part of it. THe game doesn't just exploiting the idea and brilliant representation of realistically looking liquid physics model through the whole game, which will be a tempting approach for some indie game studios. But no, they developing and evolving the original idea level after level, adapting and transforming it. And you just keep getting amazed when new properties and world conditions get introduced.At some levels the game is really challenging. Some levels can be passed only after 30 tries or so. Some levels' obvious difficulty can leave you infuriated and with no progress. And this is undoubtedly true for the very final level. There are no chances you can beat it in one sitting.This game is great. Small graphical inconsistencies here and there, like non-working antialiasing on 1440p cannot make it not great. The whole idea and implemention are great. If you're into indie gaming and your library is not like CoD 15 and BF 5 likes all the way up and down you should probably check it out. And I presume you'll not be dissatisfied."

Some players dislike the physics of the liquids, but I feel that it is pretty consistent for a simulation game. The camera can be downright awful sometimes as it attempts to keep as much fluid on the screen as possible, which is not a good idea when fast-paced areas cause your liquid to spread out as some parts trail behind. This makes some obstacles frustrating when you are less able to see them coming.Overall, it's a difficult game and suffers from physics bugs from time to time.

It's a simple yet horribly fustrating puzzle game with plenty of levels to keep you entertained. The music is great too. My only real complaint is there are sometimes not enough direction in some levels - like after spending all this time NOT evaporating the liquid to suddenly going into a level where the objective is to evaportate as much liquid as you can. I was baffled and had to redue the level multiple times before finally figuring out that I was supposed to be doing the opposite of everything the game told me to do in previous levels. Who knows though, I might just be bad at ths game haha. Either way its a fun game that I was suggest to anyone looking for an almost mellow puzzle game."

It doesn't feel like you have much control over what is happening at all and you are just watching it play out. Your only controls are tilting the screen back and forth which has very little affect on the liquid and only makes minor changes like you either will or won't make it past the obstacle if you aren't pressing the correct way. What makes it frustrating is that even if you hold the opposite direction completely the liquid still keeps moving along the path with or without you making you feel like you are just along for the ride and not actually figuring anything out.

You don't have full control over the liquid though. The liquid moves depending on gravity and momentum (or other factors, depending on which level you're at). All you can do is angle the screen left or right, making the liquid move that way. The angling also helps you slow down or speed up your liquid. You only need 2 buttons, left and right. The liquids you control differ from level to level. Sometimes, it's a thick goo that sticks well together, othertimes it's an explosive goo that explodes when it crashes against a surface.Looking at the levels, they really look nice. Graphically, this game is beautiful. Gameplaywise though, some can feel really unfair. You can't see what's ahead, so finishing a level on the first try is very difficult. There are a couple levels where it's not very well explained what you need to do or how the physics have changed from the previous level. There are no checkpoints in any level, meaning you need to complete the entire level in one go. Most of the levels are however quite short.The game doesn't store its info on the steam servers, so if you uninstall the game, you lose all your progress.Looking back, I like the idea, but too many levels feel unfair and become unfun.

However, I still do not recommend this game, as it is not really FUN. This however, is according to my personal taste, so I will elaborate further.=================================================================This game seems at first to remind me of fun titles such as World of Goo, Nightsky, and other physics based platformers with objects to control.(-) However, its more frustrating, as the liquid is not as controllable as you'd expect. Most times, it is quite random how much liquid you'd lose along the way, so getting a gold medal depends more on luck (and trying a million times) rather than having perfect control of the ""physics"".(-) The game has options to assign different ""left"" and ""right"" for the liquid and for the environment, but this simply doesn't work. It makes the game unplayable. Not sure why they have these settings when all you need are 2 keys to play the game.(+) This I suppose makes it a pro for keyboard players, since you don't need an XBOX controller to play this game, like many steam games nowadays.(+) Another good point is that there is a lot of variety. You will ""handle"" different liquids in different environments. The artistic value is there, and it does show that the developers tried with this game.(-) The variety however is pretty much summed up in the two lines above. You will not have to use your brain or solve puzzles to progress. You simply follow the linear path, trying to avoid obstacles or things that will reduce the amount of liquid you have. You WILL lose liquid. The point is trying to get to the end with enough to progress to the next level.Unfortunately, this game simply isn't as fun as the games mentioned above.I have played many games. Some pull you in. Some repel you. This game does neither. For this I am still inclined to open it up and play it to the end, but at the same time I'm not really having as fun as I do with games that do pull me in.There isn't a challenge per se. You go from A to B without any chance to deviate from the path.I still open this game up from time to time, as I like to complete my games. But this one is taking a while since I don't have fun when I do. It's not a BAD game though, but it's not one that I can recommend."
,Recommended,222140,10166863,"Posted: 18 May, 2014",all,TeamKiller[153],"Puddle is a Physics based puzzle game where you control various liquids, by tilting the screen using the left and right arrows on your keyboard. Each liquid has it's own properties, and you must use those inorder to navigate your way to the exit, past obsticles and hazards all the while keeping as much substince as possible. Personally I thought the first half of the game was actually kindof fun and creative. Each ""chapter"" gives you time to learn about the new liquid, and the transitions between each are quite creative. However besides the human body chapter, the second half of the game is just painfully hard. I'm not saying I don't like a little challenge now and then, but when you have to be almost flawless to get enough liquid to the end, it's kindof off putting. The Foundry level is what really tested my patients, so much in fact that 6 months ago (atleast) I gave up and didn't  even atempt trying until today, and beat it. Never before has a game made me so frusterated, that I just gave up, and I'm a very patient person. Ask anybody! Now the game does allow you to skip upto 4 levels if you find them too hard, but I could not bring myself to do such a thing. While this game does have a a rather high difficulty, it looks very preaty and is quite fun at the begining. I would not recommend this to anyone who does not have the patients to complete the game, but if you are willing (and it's on sale) then give it a look see. It might just surprise you.

This one is fun and challenging as you have to make sure to keep whatever liquid you're guiding around each level stays in contact as much as possible.  Gotta have the closest to the original amount left! I will say this though... TRYING TO EARN GOLD MEDALS (aka - best ranking possible for a level) CAN BE A PAIN IN THE A$$!! But I love it anyhow! :PDefinitely check this game out if you can and if you like physics games then why aren't you already trying to make sure your puddle of water isn't drying out in the fires already?!?!!"

With beautiful graphics, great physics engine and very well designed levels it keeps itself fresh and fun to say the least.The controls are limited, which might be a bit frustrating if you want to get the best score in a level. However, levels are well planned, letting the player interact constantly with it.Puddle lets you explore two main ways to finish a level: take a while and focus on keeping the most of the fluid intact or rushing through the level to get the best time. Yet, you'll have to combine both ways, to make the best score.The puzzle characteristics of the game doesn't make it boring, on the contrary, it requires a good use of its dynamics to complete them.While not being exactly immersive, the audio and graphics create a very pleasant atmosphere that merges perfectly with the entire purpose of the game.A Bit short but a great choice for those who like casual and puzzle games."

I think I understand why.Remember those old wooden games where you had to get the little marble past a series of holes in a wooden maze [image here:http://img0.etsystatic.com/008/0/7167039/il_570xN.405487188_jh4y.jpg]? Those maze games were the bane of my childhood. Puddle shares a lot of similarities with those maze games.Much of Puddle is skill-based in the same way those maze games were; you have to gain a ""feel"" for which way this thing is going to travel, calculate when to change its direction and perform the series of maneuvers perfectly or you've frakked up and have to start over. If you let your blob hit a wall and split off into 6-7 little blobs, that's it, you might as well start over.It's a little too frustrating for my tastes."

They rely on memorization. The liquid's flow is kind of interesting. There's something very turd-like about the whole game. Seems  like the game doesn't tilt enough but probably if they allowed more tilt it wouldn't make me like the game much more anyway.I got bored after 15 minutes, with trying to preserve my liquid turds. It aint no Skyrim. That's for sure."

,Not Recommended,222140,3987316,"Posted: 15 August, 2013",all,Monukai,"Puddle is a liquid physics platformer, for the better part of the game you control liquid which you much guide to the end of each level. Obstacles and hazards stand in your way, if you venture too close to these the liquid ""protagonist"" will diminish, lose too much mass and it's game over. It's a unique idea, at any rate I haven't heard of another liquid physics platformer out there. As you progress through the game you will encounter a lot of different mechanics as well as different liquids (which each have their own properties). I will say that I appreciate and applaud the many great ideas that the developers had for these different levels, and the overall variety from biome to biome (and sometimes even from level to level) was one of the most enjoyable aspects of this game.Unfortunately, it is also one of the worst aspects of the game. While a lot of these levels were enjoyable to play, others however were downright frustrating and even counter-intuitive at times. I don't discredit the interesting ideas behind some of these problematic levels, but somewhere along the lines something didn't translate. If I didn't know any better, I feel like this might have been noticed during testing and Q&A, because one of the ""features"" of the game is the ability to skip levels by using the ""Skip and Whine"" feature. Sounds to me like somewhere along the lines the developers were aware of these frustrating and poorly design levels and rather than remove or improve, they decided to add a skip feature mocking who should so dare to dislike a level.This is conjecture of course, what I can say that levels like the ones where your controls are reversed for the entire level ended up making me hate playing the game. It might be worth picking up in a bundle, especially if you are unlike me and don't mind using the ""skip and whine"" feature, just be warned that you can only ""skip and whine"" so many levels until you have to go back and beat some of them to skip more. At the end of the day, I was glad when I beat the game. Not because I was glad to beat it, but I was glad it was over. I will reiterate that there is a lot of great ideas in the game, plenty which work, but it's the bad ones that really put a stopper to the enjoyment and have ultimately led me to rate this down."

76561198004615470,Recommended,222140,19710302,"Posted: 15 December, 2015",all,PJDenton,"In its concept, Puddle proposes us, quite simply, to lead liquids of varying types from point A to point B, with, of course, a certain number of difficulties along the way and a limit for the minimum of liquid you have to bring to the finish line. Nothing particular here, but, as often, it is the way in which this concept is given form that makes the game really enjoyable.In the case of Puddle, the art design does a big part of the job. It is smooth, detailed, out of time, and even, on some rare occasions, a bit poetic.The game is divided into several environments corresponding to a theme, with in each 6 levels. It ranges from the sewers to flora to laboratories, even taking you inside the human body.While on the environment, there is an electroacoustic music accompanying us in the perillous journey of the liquids, sometimes calm, sometimes dynamic, and I've found the soundtrack quite enjoyable overall (and I'm glad the devs made it available in a dlc, best to be bought during Steam sales).In terms of gameplay, it couldn't be simpler: just tilt the screen left and right with the arrow keys for the liquid to move forward or backward. Of course, some parts will require that you measure your speed, or that you adjust yourself so as to make good use of the specifities of some of the environments (such as fans, slopes, sticky parts...).However, the nature of the liquid also comes into play, and it will force you to adapt to each one (water and organic wastes do not move in the same way, obviously). There are, more or less, as much types of liquids as there are environments, but you will find some variations on certain levels.The last level of each environment will give you a bit of a change in the gameplay, though. It acts as the equivalent of a ""boss battle"", without a boss, granted, but with added specificities in the task at hand (getting the right amount of two liquids in a glass bottle while it moves on a device, for example). A welcome change after struggling in the previous challenges.Regarding the difficulty, two settings are proposed: a relatively easy one (I insist on the ""relatively""), in the form of chocolate medals (for the ""whiny players""), or a hardcore one with metal medals. The rewards are based both on time and on how much liquid you were able to save.If I didn't really suggest it so far, the devs don't take themselves too seriously, which is a good point in my book.To finish with, the negative things. There's only one that comes to my mind: the camera.At some points you will find yourself with your liquid being a bit scattered, either because that's inevitable (hopefully rarely) or because of a miscalculation. In these situations, the camera seems confused so as to how much of a zoom back it must make so that you keep an eye on what has been temporaly lost along the way. More often than not, it will keep its focus on the most forward part of the liquid, making it very difficult  for the player to gather it back. It is a bit annoying considering that, deadly obstacles apart, the game will consider a patch of liquid lagging too much behind as lost, and will remove it from your reserve.It doesn't spoil the pleasure of playing, far from it, but it is to be noted.As a side note, and camera appart, the game is not buggy at all, and I don't find it redundant, at least with the way I play to it. For the length of the game... I've got a bit more than five hours on it at the moment of writing, and I have completed 5 out of 8 of the available environments on ""whiny"" difficulty.To sum up, a lovely, humorous little game which is quite enjoyable. Best to be played little by little in my view."
