76561198006541362,Not Recommended,222160,19309850,"Posted: 27 November, 2015",all,stranger1982,"In Hamlet you play the part of a time traveler who inadvertently squelches the real Hamlet with his time machine and thus decides to take his place as the hero of the story: you'll be solving puzzles in five different chapters made up of five levels each.While sporting some nice art and a quirky humour Hamlet can sadly quickly turn into an exercise in frustration due to its obtuse puzzles and somewhat useless hint system.PROS:-nice art style-quirky sense of humour permeates the whole game-some puzzles are interesting and offer a fair challengeCONS:-apart from the title and characters the Hamlet theme is basically never touched uponCONS:-most puzzles have an obtuse design and are very vague in how they function. Sometimes you have to click more than once, sometimes the clicking is timed, other times you have to memorize a quite lengthy sequence or just try and make sense of very vague ambiental clues...I honestly managed to solve a couple puzzles simply by randomly clicking all elements once I was frustrated enough-no way to know what you can actually interact with in each screen, leading to random clicking all over in every scene-the hint system is fairly bad, not only you have to wait five full minutes before you can get said single hint but its quality ranges from feeding you the solution to a drawing as vague as the puzzle itself-not much in the way of a story and the characters offer very little apart from their name-quite short, unless you get stuck on a puzzle you'd be done in 1,5/2 hourshttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=563279116I really appreciated Hamlet's tongue in cheek take on the genre, its quirky humour, nicely drawn art and first few puzzles: but things soon got frustrating when logic got thrown out of the window and I started facing puzzles that required me to decipher a few extremely vague hints and hopefully understand what I was supposed to do. A few puzzles also require you to very quickly click certain items before they disappear and the split second timing involved can get aggravating aswell. There's a fine line between a challenging puzzle and an obtuse, frustrating one and I often felt as if Hamlet crossed said line way too many times to stay enjoyable.All this is made worse by the hint system, waiting five minutes for the hint if you're already stuck on a puzzle is not fun and, once opened, the hint was sometimes as bad as the puzzle it was supposed to help with thus leaving me bashing my head on the problem or just trying to find an external guide.It honestly says alot about the puzzle design when, after finishing the game, I still have no idea of the logic behind three puzzles as I simply solved them randomly clicking their elements while waiting for the hint to appear. For its sale price of a dollar Hamlet wasn't a total waste of my time or money but its problematic puzzles and barebones story make it an hard game to recommend."
,Not Recommended,222160,29365096,Posted: 19 January,all,Snort Cannon,"Hamlet or the last game without MMORPG features, shaders and product placement aka the worst game name I have ever heard in my entire life is a point and click game, where you play as little time traveler who disrupts the tale of Hamlet.As stated you play as a time traveler who accidentally disrupts the tale of Hamlet and now has to save Ophelia Hamlets bride to save time.In the game you don't actually don't control the small man, but you actually control the environment around you. Solving puzzles and stuff like that.The game has a somewhat decent art style and that's about all the good I actually have to say about the game. This game otherwise is rather boring and not even worth purchasing and let me explain you why.Now I absolutely love adventure games. It's my absolute favorite genre of games and the staple of this genre is cryptic puzzles, but in most adventure games there are only a few puzzles that are cryptic, but Hamlet and the rest of the name I won't even retype the entire game is cryptic.You won't be able to solve all of the puzzles without resorting to a guide. Now let me explain a bit why some of the puzzles are just way too hard. In one puzzle the little alien guy is knocked out and to wake him up you have to make him think 2x2=4 which is not explained anywhere and you only think of it logically and imagine now that the entire game is full of puzzles like that and you have yourself this game.The game is also incredibly short. With a guide (which you will definitely use by the end of act 1) will take you around an hour finish the entire game and after that there is next to no replay value what so ever.This game also sets up a sequel and since this game came out in 2012 and there's no sign of the sequel I highly doubt it will see the light of day. The developer of this game is also working on Franz Kafka The Game which is supposed to release in 2017 so hopefully his mistakes on Hamlet are fixed in that game.In the end this game is bad. It's only saving grace is the rather cute art style. Apart from that there's literally no reason to play this game as it's too cryptic. I suggest skipping this and picking something else.Final Rating:4/10Pros:+ The Art StyleCons:- Puzzles are way too cryptic- Short"

The hint system is equally bad, and considering the nonsensical and glitched puzzles, you'll probably wait the long time required to access the hint, just having to search an walkthrough after that. The story is awful, for kids at best. You see Hamlet's references, nothing more.Why is a good concept?It's a point and click adventure with action puzzles, most of them on boss battles - yes, boss battles in a P&C adventure. Also, it's a mock version of a literature classic with short comics between the acts. It will be great if it was not so poorly executed."

I love short, cheap games that tell touching stories with impossibly deep characters. Conversely, I don't love short, cheap games that are unfortunately lacking in quality—games like the obnoxiously titled Hamlet (or the last game without MMORPG features, shaders and product placement). Although it does have an attractive, cute art style, Hamlet is rife with non-intuitive, often frustrating puzzles and a plot that is ridiculous in a way that far surpasses the tasteful.Hamlet starts out with the plot of Shakespeare's famous play, but within a couple panels of the first cutscene, it's transformed into a grotesque attempt at a modernly witty version of a classic. The main character, Hamlet, is quickly replaced by a time-traveling scientist from the future who, after crashing into Hamlet and incapacitating him, is required to rescue Ophelia from Cladius in Hamlet's place. This scientist is forced to follow a line of plot that is loosely based on Hamlet to return Ophelia to her proper place at Hamlet's side. While an intriguing idea for a storyline, the delivery of the oddly sci-fi events is done in such a way that the game goes from quirky to downright deplorably ludicrous.The gameplay of Hamlet is not a standard point and click adventure. The player is missing the typical inventory system and dialogue of such a game. Hamlet is instead played in silence, with the main character only communicating in brief, uninteresting thought bubbles. The short puzzles that the player is presented with are often incredibly nonlinear, to the point where I often found myself simply clicking all around the screen to see if I could simply stumble upon the answer to some of the more farfetched puzzles. The illogical solutions to the puzzles are made more frustrating by an interface that in no way highlights which objects on the screen allow for interaction.Hamlet's frustration-inspiring, nonsensical puzzles do very little favors for its equally nonsensical plot, and not even its somewhat attractive atmosphere can pull this game back from its failings. At only an hour or two of teeth-gritting, boredom-inspiring gameplay, this tiny indie game isn't worth a misplaced dose of hopeful curiosity or the irritation that comes with its small price tag—even if it's picked up in the middle of a Steam sale. I suppose, in this case, the old adage holds true: you get what you pay for."

,Recommended,222160,12195771,"Posted: 22 September, 2014",all,Terracorex,"This is a very short point & click game with some humorous elements.  I liked the cutesy art and short Hamlet (sort of) story.  Unlike many games in this genre (fixed screen with no camera movement, limited character movement, point & click with no inventory), it has three distinct features:First, there is no indication on what you can click and what you cannot.  Sometimes when you click on an area nothing happens since the click may have to correspond to an event somewhere else on the screen. An example of this is having to click notes in the air, once you realize to do that.Second, the clicking (at times) requires a certain degree of timing to the point that it can be very difficult to do what it is necessary.  At times, it can be frustrating given the fine degree of movement required where the actual mouse movement may be very small.  At other times, it can require a fair degree of patience when you have to move the mouse very quickly and have a tiny window of time to accomplish your goal.  Some of these puzzles would be much better suited for a touch interface, since they can have a whack-a-mole flavor.Third, the puzzle elements require a degree of non-linear thinking that exceeds what I consider to be average in this sort of game.  Usually non-linearity comes from when you have an inventory and need to think of weird combinations of items.  This game has none of that, but rather can be confounding when there is seemingly nothing to do, and you have to carefully considered what minute thing has or could change given the limited interactions presented.That all being said, it took me a little under 2 hours to complete from beginning to end.  The game gives you access to a hint if you spend more than a few minutes on a puzzle.   I would say over the half the puzzles are extremely obvious and do not even take a minute to solve.  There are a few that require more thought.  Most of the time it is just figuring out the rules of what the puzzle entails.  This game had a very 7th Guest type of feeling to me in that way.I was only stumped once in the entire game with the old man and his fishing rod, where the visual clue it gave was not very helpful.  I ended up having to refer to a walk through for this one puzzle.  The thing I was missing was pretty obvious once I understood what I was doing wrong, but not to me at the time.  I suspect most people would not even get stuck at this particular point in the game, since the thing to do is a fairly common requirement in other games involving fishing rods.I may have eventually got this particular puzzle on my own, but I had reached my frustration point with that one puzzle.  This rarely happens to me for point & click games, where even if I'm not making real progress I'm at least eliminating possibilities.  Here there was none of that.  There did not seem to be anything else I could do and no amount of random clicking was going to help.  I can see for some that might be extremely frustrating where you are costing along, and wham!  Suddenly you are stuck and nothing makes sense.  That is definitely one of the features of this game.  I would not say that makes this game bad, just challenging in a perverse way.Regarding why I actually do recommend this game:  Well for me I happen to like short games that I can play and finish within a few hours.  I have a ton of games and not enough time to play them all, so having a game I can actually complete from beginning to end, getting that small sense of accomplishment is nice.  There are very few point & click games that I would ever want to replay, but this might be one in say 10 years where I forgot all the solutions to the puzzles, since it was fun having to think in odd ways to solve the puzzles.I know that there are some that dislike this game because they claim the puzzles are ""totally illogical"".   I disagree.  All the puzzles have a logical solution, provided you think in a non-linear out-of-the-box fashion.  Several of the puzzles are making fun of other point & click games.  The puzzle where you having to enter the password given the abbreviations of the elements is a prime example.  This reminded me very much of the can puzzle in 7th Guest, but unlike that puzzle which was ridiculous in how long it could take to solve, this one was much easier once you stopped to think what the answer must be.Overall I would say that a lot of clever thought went into making this game.  For the few hours of game play you get out of this game, I would say that it is an enjoyable experience for those well versed in point & click type puzzle logic."

Normally this game costs $5.This game is not worth $5!I say this because it is incredibly short. The entire game takes 1 - 2 hours and it has no replay value. The puzzles are quite unique so even if you haven't played the game in a few months you would remember how to solve the puzzles.That being said, the art style is lovely, music is nice and the puzzles are different. The one puzzle in this game was beyond frustrating. After 10 minutes I admitted defeat and asked for a clue. After staring at the clue for another 10 minutes I went onto google images. I like these point and click puzzle games and to be honest with you I would rather play a short game like this where the puzzles are clever instead of something a bit more long winded like Puzzle Agent where the puzzles are designed by flipper handed freak children that you play over and over again because the guys in the clever department took off early for lunch and never came back somehow...So... worth it if you pay under $1 or otherwise it's just too short to validate spending that amount of money.

Also, there's no voice acting, just a few basic sounds. They get the job done. And I don't think it would be worth it to fully voice any of the characters anyway, especailly since the game can be finished in roughly 1 hour.You control the game like any other point-and-click adventure. The game has fairly logical puzzles and the boss battles are something I'd like to see more often in these sort of games, even if they are terribly easy, like the ones in this game.Anyway, considering the length of the game I'd say the price is reasonable enough.[Rating: 75/100]"

Luckily the latter are only in the minority, and those tend to be those puzzles that try to actively deceive you by either supplying red herrings as hints or omit hints altogether. By that I mean the few you can find in slightly hidden notes on screen, not the actual hintsystem that you can only use after you spend a certain amount of time on a puzzle not solving it. And while they help, they nicely won't give away the whole solution.The subtitle makes me think that this game was made with some hipsterish intentions?

It makes it easy for one to get bored while playing the game since it required an ample amount of patience.  The game was a bit short though, but it isn't that expensive and I bought it while it was on sale, so I guess it was worth what I paid for it.

It's a good way to spend an hour or so in an attractively cartoony world and it's pretty fun to think back to Shakespeare as you play the game (which is only very loosely based upon Hamlet).

I remember when I was driven by this urge to solve all puzzles in any game I played without using any clues.  Sadly, that zeal is gone.  And this game only confirmed why.  When people talk about a game having clever puzzles, I get why they are saying that.The door puzzle in this game that requires you to “look” closelyis a good example of such a clever contraption.  Yet I simply don’t care.I don’t care about beating the monkey at the convoluted game of RPSjust so I can continue the story.  Its seems to be a combination of investing a considerable amount of mental energy to a puzzle only to find out the solution does not match up with this energy and the use of puzzles as artificial walls I must scale to continue the story.  Narrative-heavy P&C adven games often fall victim to the former while games like this one are prone to the latter.  Indeed it could be impossible to expect a game that has puzzles that would satisfy the itch I personally want to scratch precisely because I may be the only person who has this particular itch.  I just want to play a puzzle/adven game where I don’t feel like the puzzles are being dangled in front of me like a carrot.  I would love to try a game that makes me want to solve the puzzle in the same way I want to experience the story.  Seems like a hard balance to strike.  Maybe I have to do it myself."

Excessively long with an incredibly pretentious premise, as though there are no other games in the entire world anymore without MMORPG features, shaders, and product placement. That's certainly not the case, and I don't see why not having shaders is something to be pretentious about anyway (not to say that every game must have them, but it's not as though they're some sort of inherently bad thing either). But I guess I must have convinced myself I like adventure games too much, and so I bought this crap.The alleged logic puzzles contained within should not even be considered logic puzzles. They are more accurately described as some sort of pixel-hunting puzzles, or just ""clicking around randomly and finding out that somehow you were supposed to do that even though it makes 0% sense"" puzzles. There is no logic whatsoever in any part of the game I could stomach playing up to, and from what I've read from walkthroughs, there will continue to not be any logic. There's even some of those moments that I TOTALLY LOVE in adventure games where you can see the logical solution right in front of you, but you have to do some completely arbitrary thing before you're allowed to do it. Yay. How fun, apparently.Also, the game is apparently supposed to be funny, but I personally think it isn't. Maybe I'm just a grumpy old man."

The game lampoons not only its Shakespearean source material, but also the expected conventions of adventure gaming. Reading scraps of paper will only provide false leads. Multiple interactable objects... sometimes whole areas of the screen... are useless in these lateral thinking-esque exercises. There are some ""normal"" puzzles, sure, appearing just frequently enough to lull you into believing that the zaniness has stopped, right before you run smack into the next inane situation. But, unfortunately, none of that is actually enjoyable.For most, the appeal of puzzle games is in solving puzzles. Here, however, there is no sense of accomplishment when the screen temporarily goes black, signifying the move to the next level. Oh, you might recognize the cleverness of the developer in constructing such an abstract solution, but you didn't actually solve anything. You just clicked on the part of the screen that was clickable... for one ""level"", you clicked on the exact same spot a few dozen times, just waiting for something wacky to happen.Hamlet or [etc] would make for an entertaining animated short. The character designs are cute, the movement is fluid, the sound effects surprisingly catchy. Most importantly, the surreal sense of humor would work perfectly in that medium, fitting into the mold of Chuck Jones cartoons. Take the existing assets, drop the forced clicking, and you've got something here. As a game, however, it's not worth playing at any price."
