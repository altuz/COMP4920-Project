Initially this game had a really rough day 1, with issues such as frame rate drops/frame skipping, unbearable online play and a bunch of other problems. However since I got to play the public beta version for an upcoming patch to the game, most of those problems have been addressed and I'm pretty satisifed with this game.Also don't listen to those players crying about the lack of superficial features from the PS2 version of the game like 3D Backgrounds, Arrange Soundtracks, etc. They aren't required to enjoy the game where it matters most - the gameplay.  Most of the 3D backgrounds looked awful anyways, and while the Arrange Soundtrack is really good, I'm sure there will be a way to mod the music in the game anyways as with most PC titles.If your first time playing The King Of Fighters series was XIII, you are in for a wild ride. This game is way different, everything hurts alot more, normals and anti-airs are much stronger, characters and movelists are far more diverse, and the action is very faced paced and unforgiving! Truly this game is one of the finest 2D fighting game classics out there, and you can even play the original '98 in all it's glory.Last but not least, Eiji Kisaragi is the greatest. So glad to play with him again. He's a real beastly character."

It doesn't include the features the PS2 one does because that's not the version that was ported. It's a port of the XBLA version with all the balance changes applied to it. It's about as close to arcade perfect as you'll get. I can understand why people would be disappointed by that, but all things considered this is a good port. Now let's talk about the part everybody cares about most.The netcode itself seems to be about KoFXIII's levels of quality. So it's very playable, but not perfect. This has been my experience with player matches only with players ranging from 100ms to 200ms. Yes, it displays the ping times, thank God. When someone's connection has issues, you can definitely feel the delay, but it resyncs pretty quickly.Single player consists of small challenges, arcade mode, 1v1 matches, etc. All the stuff you would expect from a fighter. It also includes the NeoGeo version of KoF98 if you want to play that.So to sum it up: few SP modes, no PS2 features, only way to play FE outside of arcades, netcode is good for input delay based netcode. So you're getting an arcade faithful version of KoF98UM FE with online play. I'm happy with it, but you can't please everybody. One little thing I'm personally happy about is that everybody is unlocked from the start, too."

I can play with people from US East Coast (~200 ms ping) very smoothly. By the way, I'm from Brazil, so naturally I can play smoothly with pretty much anyone in South America.Just keep in mind that you shouldn't be playing with someone whose ping is 250ms+, because even if the netcode is wonderful, miracles won't happen. Don't expect to get a smooth gaming experience when playing someone from Mars.IMPORTANT: Check out this thread if you're having any problems:http://steamcommunity.com/app/222420/discussions/0/626329820792416671/Note that I had been playing the original version @ GGPO for aeons.

,Recommended,222420,33087075,Posted: 1 July,all,Florida Hans,"Honestly, this is my favorite fighting game of all time HOWEVER please read the end of this review to consider your purchase. It has a perfect in-between of offensive and defensive tactics. Yeah, you can do combos in like every good fighting game, (even games you don't expect have them like Mortal Kombat II), but you don't win fights solely on that (and they're not very long combos either), you have to space, evade, and use certain special moves, normals, combos at the right opportunities. NOW this sounds all generic, but it's how The King of Fighters handles this makes it even more prevalent. It's a very simple fighter to pick up, but still deep enough to make it very engaging and worth while to learn. Controls are very tight, and while the input timing is strict, it's very rewarding and I honestly feel it helps the game since you have to work harder for the more damaging special moves and supers. Of course how I can forget to mention the large variety of characters.A lot of what I said could be applied to the vanilla version of The King of Fighters '98, and honestly, this version is only slighty better! You got retuned balance, which the original was already nicely balanced as is, and the added characters and added ex versions is of course very welcomed, making it feel more complete. You have 40+ characters to pick from, 50+ if you count the EX versions, so you'll be bound to find a favorite, let alone three.HOWEVER, there is one major flaw with this game. The netplay isn't that great. As you may know, I'm from Florida (GEE WIZ how could anyone figure that out!?), and I played with a friend from California. Our experience was alright, we got some epic matches in, but we for sure faced several problems with lag, and at times the game would even hang awkardly for a few seconds. This game goes for about 15 US bucks, and I am recommending this because I love this game. I recommend playing the original first, you can have online matches through FightCade, and if you really like that, get this version. Right now it's about $5.09 USD (i'm writing this during the 2017 summer sale) so you can't find a better time to get this amazing game. But if you're hesitant because of the poor netplay, that's understandable, and while $15 dollar is a good deal for a game like this, with such a large roster and such a great quality of the game itself, there are however features missing from the previous UM version such as color edit mode, 3D backgrounds, and arranged soundtracks (something you can get as a mod). If this had better netplay I give it a much more confident Thumbs up, but here it's a more It's a thumbs up, BUT it's something to think about, that's for sure."

King of Fighters is my favorite video game franchise and I have been playing it for years now. even though I have the PS2 version of this already, I was psyched when this was coming to Steam. I'm happy to support SNK because they deserve it. They make quality games. BUT, this particular version of the game is terrible. It honestly♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off pretty bad. Allow me to explain the reasons.1. True full-screen mode is not optional.What is with this? In the PS2 version of '98 Ultimate Match, the game is in full screen like it should be.  I get that this is an arcade version, but this really could not be stretched for the steam release. The sidebars are distracting and I don't like playing my games in a tiny window in the middle of the screen. It's a good idea to have the sidebars if you're setting up an arcade cabinet with this game. But, it should be optional. Boo to them on that.2. No arranged music option.WHY? The PS2 version had it. Why not this? Would it have been so hard to include it? I think not. This is a big let down. I like both the OST and AST. But, the option should have been there.3. No color editing.Once again, WHY NOT? The PS2 version had this too! This would have added even more depth into the game if they had included it. It's fun to create your own unique color palettes for your characters. Very bad decision not to include this.4. The online.Oh boy. As much as I love KOF, I have to say that the online in KOF titles has always been terrible (At least XIII on steam is a little better). This is no exception. The online is awful. It's extremely laggy. The first match I played had about 3 second late input delay. I'm not kidding. I see why the online is dead already. It's a shame.All in all, the KOF '98 Ultimate Match is a good game. But the Steam version is not. These fatal flaws just make the game much less enjoyable and souless. If you have a PS2 or a backwards compatible PS3, get the PS2 version. It feels much more complete and joyful than this. Or, if you don't have KOF XIII on Steam or console yet, get that instead. You'll enjoy yourself a lot more. I was hoping to be able to give this a positive review. But, I can't. These stupid mistakes have ruined this version of the game for me. Let's just hope they'll do better with KOF 2002 UM when in comes to Steam. (And hopfully KOF: Maximum Impact: Regulation A)By the way, the 3D backgrounds from the PS2 version are missing. WTF?"

KING' 98 introduces the old and new in one huge event so lets get started!CHARACTER LINE UP - 10 Excellent with so many great faces who can go wrong heck you can use the new face orochi team from 97 in both forms and others have alternate or original versions as well this game is pure ""class"" and deserves its perfect score. I was blown away at how many nicely animated characters they had its great to see old favs like rugal be resurrected again in this all out fighters fest, man what a treat this game is with so many characters to master you'll be in your house for days.GRAPHICS-10 beauty perfection, a tear falls:) For those who don't know kof backgrounds and the neo in general are known for there gorgeous detail and work put into everything that is neo. I loved the backgrounds that had interaction with how the characters used them in example in the masters temple you hit the wall and stuff falls down showing the damage that you accumulated what a nice entry. All the characters look sweet from the last boss omega rugal to kyo and iori its intense kof and even competing with the ""next gen systems like the dreamcast"" a perfect translation was still not possible of the neo original you get what you buy!MUSIC-10 Duh, perfect this is great the music matches the characters exactly, the end bosses them is great the ff teams is great and my personal favorite the grudge theme when kyo and iori are great man i love i love it i tell you!!!!!GAMEPLAY-10 perfect again don't think I've gone soft and biased if you own this you know that this is one of the best kofs out there its got it all basically the characters moves are many and the comp AI is great on expert for beginners its amazing after 4 years this game still has such a fresh feel to it ""gameplay is the ultimate would be an understatement"" when you talk about 98' its the majorities favorite kof and for good reason the gameplay is a neo tradition and will keep you learning till you master!STORY- 8.0 Ok, keep in mind that the story this game has is not a story at all characters like vice and mature are good examples (*for those that don't know when you iori whent violently nuts after his awakening he killed them both) of which they exist here and its also labeled dreamatch which means that this game was a collection of years past but the story which makes little sense is still enjoyableCHARACTER INTERACTIONS - * a side note this is a new category * well there are great grudges between the characters and how they interact like kyo and iori its all there its nice to see the characters were taken so much time on and it shows because of how they act towards each other for example kensou and athena, andy mai, mary terry, its nice to see some interaction and makes you feel like the characters have feelings like people -very nice- snk"
,Recommended,222420,13406708,"Posted: 16 December, 2014",all,ANDY,"Ah, KOF '98... One of the all-time greats of the fighting game genre,and now, you got it here on steam at a much more affordable price than what I had to shell out for a Neo Geo CDZ, it even has online play to boot! So if you like fighters and wanted to check out KOF, make it this one.The roster is made up of every single fighter featured from KOF '94 to '97with the last couple of missing combatants being additions for the ""Ultimate Match"" update from some years back.You got two different styles, or ""Grooves"" if you are so inclined.Advanced plays like your average KOF game today, you fill up your gauge by fighting and it eventually adds up into separate stocks. Using a special move consumes one stock, but you can also use a stock to enter a super mode, from there, you can use one more stock to do your character's most powerful move, The other mode on the other hand takes after KOF '94-'96's style with you having to charge your stocks manually and being granted the ability to use infinite supers when at low health. The rest of the gameplay follows a 3-man team-based structure, though you cannot tag in and out party members. Once all your characters are exhausted, you lose.By far the most striking feature of KOF, however, is the jumping mechanics.You got several different types of jumping at your disposal, like a short hop and another, entirely different hyper-hop that advances you forward quickly while still staying low to the ground. It all adds together to make KOF into one of the most frantic offense-based fighters around. The different types of jumping are done by inputting specific directions and immediately moving the stick in another direction. Knowing which type of jump to go for at each moment may seem daunting at first but as long as you stick to it, it'll become second nature in no time and is definitely rewarding enough to justify the learning-curve.I really cannot stress enough that if you even have only a passing interest in fighting games,you NEED to experience KOF '98. And this new shiny rerelease with online play is just the perfect opportunity to do just that. You even get the original vanilla '98 on Neo Geo packaged with this updated rerelease if you like to be authentic!"

Ignore what the pings say (180-200) because they're clearly incorrect.Other than that there's not much to say about the game. King of Fighters '98 is one of the classics so a decent online version stands on its own. Kof98 and Super Turbo have always had a special place in my heart. They really don't make fighting games like they used to.That said, you'd think with this being their 20th anniversary game though that'd they'd pack the thing with extras or do something cool like SF2AE where you could play all the old character versions... unfortunately that is not the case. There's a challenge mode, some EX characters and that's about it. No art gallery, no arranged soundtrack, no real graphics filter... these things are just examples of stuff that would take minimal effort to include and would make the game so much better. The King of Fighters '98 arranged soundtrack is one of the best video game soundtracks of all time.It's nice but the game could be so much more. Really shows how times are with SNK. Frankly it's a miracle it has decent netcode and asking for anything more is too much to ask any fighting game developer these days save ArcSys it seems."

This game's replay value pays itself back so well for the vast amount of characters to potentially master.Be warned you have to find your opponents through SNK fighting game communities like Dream Cancel or Orochinagi though. Since lobby search is deader than dead. When you do find someone it's  only featuring people who play on a DSL modem or a wifi adapter you would find at a dollar store.As for the gameplay. This game series is a rude awakening if your first game was something like the Street Fighter IV series.  Since Anti Airing, General footsies, execution timing/leniency, how command/super throws, and priority of moves are quite different than what you may have been accustomed to. The combos are pretty forgiving in this game to get adjusted to.Lastly regarding the netcode of this game. It depends greatly on how far your opponent is from you and how good both of the opponents' ISP package. If one has mediocre internet, then the experience won't be any better even if the other player has the best high speed wired connection in your continent. It's inevitable though you'll get a player with a mediocre Wi-Fi connection though.  When this happens. You'll notice inputs dropping alot and throw timing off for you.Despite these flaws.

Great roster of fighters, excellent art and almost-unmatched gameplay makes an unforgettable fighting experience! Its graphics and visual effects continue to be impressive even almost twenty years later, with beautifully-animated sprites and rich backgrounds, accompanied by superb voice acting and some of the loudest sound effects I've ever heard.As this is a ""dream match""-style game, released after the conclusion of the Orochi story arc, there isn't much to say story-wise; it features most of the characters which appeared from KOF '94 to '97, Rugal returning as the final boss (using his ""Omega"" form), and the ""Ultimate Match"" version has additional characters, such as the Boss Team and Eiji Kisaragi, among others. Ultimate Match also adds new backgrounds, along with a new fighting style, ""Ultimate"".KOF'98 still keeps itself fresh, exciting and relevant after all those years. Its competitive potential is enough to keep players hooked for hours, fighting against each other, and the computer-controlled fighters can also pose a great challenge for those who prefer to spend their time playing by themselves. However, its matchmaking service is lacking (well, at least it does not seem to work as it should here; maybe it's a connection issue) and online battles are plagued with delay, rendering the game almost unplayable sometimes. I wish there were more players available for online matches, nonetheless.One of the best fighting games ever, sold for a bargain price. You ought to pick it up! - 10/10"

There's such a delightfully large variety among the cast of characters, whether it's ease of use, skill cap, playstyle, or personality that it's really hard to not like at least a couple of them. There are so many ways to fine-tune your playstyle and mess around with different options, e.g. ordering your characters in different ways or hand-picking the different Advanced or Extra options, that you can really find something that works for you or use stuff way differently than it was intended and still have fun. What's really important, however, is that the game doesn't present it all up-front so as to intimidate newer players. It's all pretty smoothly integrated into the regular gameplay, with the exception of typical fighting game shenanigans like memorizing special moves and such. The game is excellent at really making you feel comfortable with the mechanics and cast and really lets you experiment until you find something that fits you just right, and it's because of this that I recommend it to anyone who might be interested in fighting games. Simple enough and with a wide enough breadth of content on a surface level to draw anyone in, fighting game player or not, yet technically complex and demanding enough to keep veterans interested for a very long time."
,Recommended,222420,32304993,Posted: 9 June,all,PAG VicViper,"TL;DR1. This is not only the best KOF, but IMO the best fighting game period.2. The port is solid, works really well offline, but doesn't have the best online and is missing features from the PS2 port.3. This game needs more exposure!INTRO: A BRIEF HISTORY OF KOF 98KOF 98 at its first release quickly became one of SNK's biggest blockbusters in the arcades. Having just wrapped up their first significant story arc, the Orochi Saga, in 97, SNK decided to make their first Dream Match game, where the cast was not bound by any canon restrictions. As a refinement upon gameplay concepts explored in KOF 97 and featuring characters who had died during the Orochi Saga, 98 was received with open arms.In the years that followed, KOF 98 stood as a legend in fighting games and remained one of the pinnacles of KOF. Through new KOF entries and even SNK's own demise, 98 remained a constant in the KOF community and still has strong widespread communities today.To celebrate the 10 year anniversary, SNK released a remake in KOF 98 Ultimate Match, where a lot of positive changes were made to the original, including the rework of the previously weak and gimmicky Extra mode, and cool new characters were added. 98UM brought back the '96 boss team (Geese Howard, Wolfgang Krauser, and Mr. Big) as well as Kasumi and Eiji. In addition to these, 4 new EX characters were added (EX Blue Mary, EX Yamazaki, EX Geese, and EX King: the former three being based on their appearances in Real Bout Fatal Fury 2, while EX King being based off her Art of Fighting appearance).These 9 additional characters round out the cast to a whopping 59!However, there were some significant balance problems that plagued it, the most infamous of which being Krauser's dominance: his overwhelming strength was enough for him to end up on the teams for most players. After Tougeki 2008, KOF 98UM had lost a lot of popularity. Most in the 98 community preferred the original to the Krauser fest.A couple years later in 2010, a new revolution in the arcade industry was introduced in the form of NESiCAxLive, an online distribution service for arcade games ran by Taito. SNK Playmore chose to release 98UM and 02UM on the service. 02UM already having been an amazing success for them, they wanted 98UM to attain similar success. And here is where we get to...KOF 98 UM [FINAL EDITION]For KOF 98 UM's NESiCA release, SNK Playmore decided to update 98UM. This update brings about a host of balance changes (great list compiled herehttp://dreamcancel.com/wiki/index.php?title=King_of_Fighters_98UM_Final_Edition)to fix the problems of the first 98UM. With the exception of Krauser receiving a host of nerfs and touches to Iori's command grab and Eiji's MAX projectile super, the entire cast received buffs and/or quality of life changes, and certain system mechanics were standardized (Extra meter charge times, charge motion input times).It's absolutely astounding how well refined the balance became. EVERYONE is strong, EVERYONE is a threat. The tier list is SUPER compressed as a result of how viable everyone in the game is. Everyone has fun and interesting tools. Honestly this may be the closest to perfection humanity may see in this lifetime.So yeah this game is ♥♥♥♥ing amazing on the gameplay end of things, but let's take a look at this port finally.3 years of thinking we may never get this game, and it finally comes.TECHNICAL REVIEWThis is a pretty solid port, but unfortunately not quite as incredible as the game itself is. Code Mystics ported over the 360 version of the game and implemented the Final Edition balance changes with new netcode. WHAT DOES THIS MEAN?!?!?Well unfortunately that means this version doesn't include certain features from the PS2 version.-No 3D stages (your mileage may vary, I don't like these very much personally)-No arranged music (easily modded in if you look at the guides, but not having options is the slightest touch annoying)-NO COLOR EDIT (this I'm actually really tight about. It's probably possible to mod the color palletes in the game but UUUUUUUUUUUGH)All the other stuff is there though, and the game runs really well. The button config is also way better than the 360 version as not only can you just select the button you want to configure and hit your button, BUT YOU CAN TEST YOUR BUTTONS IN THE MENU. No more menuing through all those buttons and being utterly confused as to which buttons on your nonstandard controller/stick are which!Code Mystics was also REALLY COOL and patched in options to see your inputs in training mode! No frame counter on it but still cool.ONLINEOnline multiplayer is basically a requirement these days, aaaaaaaaand that 360 version's online was really really bad. How's this version? Not ideal unfortunately, but servicable enough in some cases I guess?Despite GGPO's revolutionary rollback netcode implementation being a tried and true method, having cultivated large communities together for older games, it's unfortunately not here. Instead using the clearly outdated method of just adding input delay to compensate for lag.This leaves me to address something that's outside the scope of this port.THE COMMUNITYOne of things that curses 98UMFE is that the only platforms it's been released on are Steam and NESiCA. This ends up actually limiting some of the outreach this game can get as1. NESiCA isn't the most widely spread arcade platform. A lot of KOF tournaments for older games are held on the original boards they came out on, including 02UM.2. Steam (and PC in general honestly) isn't the most popular platform for tournaments in general. Most games utilize consoles or arcade boards where applicable.It'd be really cool if 98UMFE was released on MORE platforms so it could hopefully get more exposure."

Minor complaint.-Krauser is disgustingly good.Until Capcom releases Third Strike on Steam, this is the best classic fighting game you can currently buy. If you play vanilla 98 on Fightcade a lot, you owe it to yourself to throw SNK a few bucks for this beautiful port. 10/10"
76561198009702779,Recommended,222420,32325957,Posted: 10 June,all,Bard,"The King of FIghters series is aptly named as to date it's still my favourite fighting series. It's technical, flashy and oozes style and KoF 98 is the absolute cream of the crop. This Steam version is in my opinion the optimal version of KoF 98 as it combines many of the best elements of previous versions, my only complaint is it would have been nice to have included the arranged soundtrack as an option, but that said the original soundtrack is still spectacular.So what makes KoF so good? For one I really like the story of these games which I realise is an unusual pro for a fighting game series, but from Fatal Fury (technically the first KoF) I found myself invested in the characters, specifically Terry Bogard's grudge match with Geese Howard and their battle across South Town and my interest has only grown from there. KoF's roster is large and loud, boasting unique personalities that all have their own reasons for entering the tournament and have interesting and sometimes comical pre fight interactions with one another. Once again as with many Neo Geo titles SNK really pushed the hardware at the time and worked within it's limitations to truly create something special, it's a delight to play and it looks fantastic. From the introduction sequence you'll instantly pick up the visual style and fantastic sound direction, intro sequences in arcade games are usually something special as they lure in punters to spend their hard earned cash and here it's no exception, the opening theme and video effects really get you in the mood for a good scrap. Starting up the game here you pick your style and three fighters to roll with, you can opt to go with the pre selected teams or mix and match to create your own unique one, this can be a little daunting for new players as it means you have to learn three characters if you want to get good and play competitively against others, but if you have the patience to put in the time it really pays off.I'm not sure what else to say, if you're a fighting game fanatic you no doubt already have your own opinions on KoF 98, if you're a newcomer there are maybe easier places to start, but don't let that discourage you, because if you really put in the time you'll have a handle on one of the greatest fighting games of all time. So what are you waiting for, grab an arcade stick, choose your fighters and get ready for the greatest smack down of your life!"

To truly experience this game to its full potential, I strongly suggest purchasing a fightstick. This game is fully playable with a keyboard, and some actually do, but it is not recommended.Now let's talk a bit about the online. Quite frankly, the online in this game is acceptable. I know several people lombast it, but compared to other fighting games, it certainly isn't bad. That said, I come from the old arcade culture, and I have yet to play a single fighting game online that is acceptable to me. I simply cannot abide by ANY level of input delay. I am very greatful for this game's input delay display (available in the beta version) so I at least know exactly how psychic I am going to have to be, or how early I need to prompt my inputs.If you are a fan of fighting games, especially if you have other friends whom are as well, this game is a must buy.

The netcode, even after multiple patches, is questionable at best --- playing the original '98 with proper rollback is still the way to go. The exclusion of 3D backgrounds and an arranged soundtrack is no tragedy, and the game is perfectly playable without them, but still rather bothersome. The real problem lies with the game itself --- the damage has been turned far, far down from the original '98. The amount of health that each character has is more akin to XIII than the older entries. This would be perfectly fine for a game like 2002, where long combos dominate high level play, but a huge part of '98's appeal is the lack of such combos: most of everything is under ten hits, just enough that learning combos will give most players an edge, but huge combos do not dominate competitive play and the game remains tactically well-rounded. Turning the damage down in such a game makes matches draw on for a bit too long, long enough to stagnate. As a result, Time Outs are far more common in this game than in the original '98, and strong tactics are far less threatening --- the game is less about being constantly on your toes and more about getting your opponent into a situation where you can hit them with your character's best tactics several times in a row in order to do as much damage as using that tactic once would do in the original '98.Some older fighting games just don't really translate well into the modern scene --- see Super Street Fighter II Turbo HD Remix for a perfect example. It might seem like a good idea to tune down damage and nerf strong tactics for these games at face value, but this ultimately destroys much of what made these games popular to begin with. The reason why people still play Super Street Fighter II Turbo, Samurai Shodown II, Street Fighter Alpha 3, and indeed King of Fighters '98 is that they are very high risk/high reward at all levels of play. One mistake can doom a player for an entire match in these games. There's a sort of tension to these games that modern fighting games lack almost entirely (though they make up for it in other aspects). This revision fails to capture this almost entirely. It tailors the game to a modern audience --- one that has King of Fighters XIII anyway, and has demonstrated time and time again that it doesn't care about this game in the slightest, as this game failed in arcades and failed to make it into any major tournaments.If you just want the new characters and don't mind gimped damage and weakened tactics with almost nothing to replace them, this game is decent. However, the original version of this game is the way to go if you value the things that made it fun. Most people should either play the original '98 on GGPO or Fightcade or something, wait for King of Fighters 2002 Ultimate Match, which translates far better into a modern setting, or just get King of Fighters XIII."

But once you slave in the lab for days nailing down frame links and combos you'll soon grow and crush your enemies.The roster is giant with even the welcome sights of boss characters like Rugal, Kaiser and GEEESE, there are plenty of play styles from each distinct character that gathering your own team is simple given enough patience.Sadly the story is lacking in this game, with the simple arcade and single play modes leading to climatic battle which soon fizzles out into the credits. However, for those that play for the hype of fighting the game will serve you well.Overall, I would recommend this game for anyone who wants to expand their view on fighters and see why the KOF series is so dear to so many peoples hearts."

The NeoGeo version that is.The problem is however, that this new steam version has NO players online and is almost impossible to find anyone to play against with a ping < 500ms. And I live in the UK with fibre internet. I can ping 15ms to servers in the UK.  The trouble is there just aren't any players to find online here it seems. Not on this side of the world anyway.Except there probably are, they are just not using this version. Maybe they use emulators. Or they play offline. Or only play with friends they invite in private matches. Or they use a real neogeo. I don't know, but it is such a let down for me, when I just want to start a game and find someone to play against and this game just doesn't let you do that unless you live in Asia. Or if you would like to try playing a fast paced fighting game with over 500ms then great.It's not really the games ""fault"" that there are not many people playing. By ""not many"" I mean basically 2 people in the UK have this game by the looks of it. Seriously? Where is everyone!?!  If I search for a game and it takes 20min plus to find someone, and they have 500ms then something is wrong.I know I can get a ping < 100 ms to USA servers so why I hardly even see any of those is beyond me. USA have a strong following for games like KOF.. but so far I have played against just 1 single person with a ping under 100ms (was 80ms) and that game played very well. But just 1 single person..  so where is everyone?Or maybe the matchmaking is broken? !!  That is an idea..So basically, the game is great... seriously brilliant gameplay, just really pointless if you cannot find a single person to play it WITH.Maybe advertise the game a little? Get people to know it even exists on steam? I only found it by chance, and I'm a FAN of kof98.And maybe if I had of known this version would be like this I would not have bought it. If you know people who you can invite to play then you will have a great time with this.I <3 SNK but this is just not worth it.** I guess people would say ""oh it's your firewall and router blarr blarr"" which is strange as every other game I play inc streetfighter works fine online. It's a shame because kof98 is so much better than SF."

,Recommended,222420,27174867,"Posted: 24 November, 2016",all,feitclub,"don't let my steam ""hours played"" metric deceive you: KOF 98 is a game I played for 2-3 hours a day, every day, for months after I first got my hands on it. It was a game with 56 playable characters -a ridiculous amount at the time, even more so today - and I made it my business to get to know them all. By the end I could play a team at random and have a decent chance at pulling out a victory against my friends.KOF 98 Ultimate Match takes that core gem, that timeless classic, and throws in even more characters. So now there's no need to ask about your fav because your fav is RETROACTIVELY IN THE GAME (unless your fav is K9999, sorry)I admit I'm smitten and old and my perspective is hardly universal: if you're new to KOF or fighting games in general, this is a lot to absorb. And the game's tutorials/challenges are terrible at explaining just what the hell is going on or what you need to learn. But if you can find your way into this game it can give you an infinite amount of replayability. And SNK packed this game with so many colorful personalities that I promise you that you'll fall in love with at least one character who may or may not be named Yamazaki."

KOF98 Ultimate Match is one of those times.An updated version of the classic Neo-Geo 3-on-3 fighting game, Ultimate Match provides players with a truly complete roster of characters from the first three KOF games.  The conspicuously absent Boss Team from 1996 joins the game roster, along with Art of Fighting's resident ninja Eiji Kisaragi (last seen in KOF95), and aikido devotee Kasumi (from KOF96's womens' team); and endboss Omega Rugal is joined by 96's infamously cheap Goenitz and a newly renovated version of Orochi, the skinny-jeans wearing snake god from KOF97.Make no mistake; aside from the obvious exclusion of the boss characters, all the new characters in 98 UM are balanced to fit in with the rest of the cast, which itself has had some tweaks, both major and minor, to make them play just a bit differently from the original version.  WIth the Final Edition, further rebalancing attempts were made to ensure that all 59(!) characters are viable, with some underappreciated characters (such as Lucky Glauber) getting a much-needed boost in effectiveness.If I had any complaints about this PC port, it's that I wish it had a couple of the extra features from the PS2 version of KOF98UM, like the single-player challenges and palette editor.  As it is, it's a straight port of the 2009 release on Xbox 360, with some brand new balance tweaks.  Those are pretty minor omissions, however, and for the price tag, you're getting a good deal nonetheless."
