,Recommended,222440,14688248,"Posted: 28 February, 2015",all,RUNNING ★ WILD,"While the original King Of Fighters 2002 is massively played, I think the original version is a mess of a game. Terrible, sloppy balancing, missing key characters (King), the soundtrack was god awful, and the presentation was weak. However after 1999, 2000 and 2001, one thing 2002 did right was return KOF back to it's roots after years of experimenting with new system mechanics that weren't well recieved, such as the Striker system.The King Of fighters 2002 Unlimited Match much like '98 Ultimate Match before it, is a complete overhaul of the original game. Hell 2k2UM is an even bigger overhaul than 98UM was. KOF2k2UM brings back everybody from the NESTS Saga as 98UM brought back everybody from the Orochi Saga. Plus it also brings back the New Faces Team from KOF97, this being a Dream Match game and all. 2k2UM also includes characters from the PS2 version of the original 2002, such as Goenitz and Geese!2k2UM beefs up many characters movelists with moves that 99/00/01 introduced, along with some new additions, for example Mai Shiranui has her rekka special move straight out of Real Bout Fatal Fury Special, and Terry Bogard gained his Quick Burn special move from Real Bout Fatal Fury Special: Dominated Minds, which is a pretty obscure move from a very obscure game.Alongside new moves for many characters, 2k2UM also brings EX versions of characters such as Robert, Kensou and Takuma from 99/00. EX Robert is a charge style character, while EX Kensou  does not have his psychic powers, and EX Takuma is pretty much alot like 98 Takuma.Probably the biggest improvement from the original 2002 to UM is the presentation. The game looks very nice and refined, backgrounds are fantastic, HUD looks great, and the soundtrack is a huge improvement over the original, some of my favorite themes being Kyokugenryu Team, Korea Team, and the new Mustard For Geese arrangement.As with 98UMFE on Steam, 2k2UM is based on the Xbox Live Arcade version of the game, which is in turn based on the 2002UM Tougeki arcade update of the game. Unlike the XBLA version though, the netcode in this version is pretty solid from what I played. I managed to play with a friend all the way from California with barely 4-5 frames of input delay at 150-200ms ping, which is pretty playable.Players coming from 98UM should feel pretty well at home with 2k2UM, although 2k2UM has a bit of a different feel from 98UM. 2k2UM is alot faster, and the controls are more loose compared to 98UM's tightness, although it's not nearly as loose as say KOFXIII.If you are a KOF/SNK fan or just a fan of fighting games in general, I highly recommend picking up this game. If you are new to fighters though, you may want to tread lightly. This game is extremely unforgiving as most KOF games tend to be. If your only fighting game experiences are with games like Street Fighter or Mortal Kombat, you are in for one helluva ride."

Even if you already played the Neo-Geo version of KOF 2002, this one feels like a completely different game with all the changes. The stages and music are all-new, K9999 is overhauled into the new character Nameless, and even veteran characters like Terry and Mai are given new moves. The combo system is very deep without being cheap and unintuitive like in XIII, and the playable cast is even bigger than MvC2. It's not a 100% comprehensive representation of the Neo-Geo KOF series, but it's without a doubt the single finest example of it. I give 2002 UM my highest recommendation possible."

,Recommended,222440,16885244,"Posted: 4 July, 2015",all,ImALittleBear,"This is probably as good as it gets when it comes to Retro Fighters. At least the King of Fighters Series. This game plays well on an Intel Celeron 2.53ghz processor, and an Intel HD Graphics Card with 2GB Ram. The controls are surprisingly smooth with a Gamepad and the loading times are not there at all. The only thing I dislike in this version is the choose your fighter interface. There is also no ""3D Backgrounds"" like other remakes in the series had to enhance their appearance (look at King of Fighters 99 and Millineum Fight on DC for examples of 3D enhanced backgrounds. Hit detection is dead on for the most part but there is also some things there where the punches and kicks just don't land where they are supposed to. This is a a slightly minor annoyance probably enhanced by higher resolutions and or graphics filters. All in all this is a solid fighting game, even if it just has one title. I wish this game would have inlcluded the original KOF 2002 like the KOF 98 offering did here. Not a biggy but should be there to sweeten the deal. 8/10"

You would be wondering, Is there a new story coming out from Eolith? Well, no, you will be playing the Dream Match game once more, after KOF98. The second dream match is up for you players to have another experience on the fighting arena once more. Behold! King of the Fighters 2002 ~ Challenge to the Ultimate Battle!This game doesn't rules, but bringing back the past KOF memories.....With New Face Team back, Iori's past team mates Vice and Mature ''revived''. Rugal...... well, I can gurentee you would want to play it. And all characters were stronger now. With moves, and new experience!This game doesn't have storyline, unfortunately, but it doesn't matter, since you are playing the ''non-story'' KOF game. This game still provides some pack of fun and fighting experience that you've ever imagined. However, your boss, is still the same Omega Rugal, except for now, he's much stronger.Artwork could use some improvement. But a big great news is Athena became a main ''model'' for this years KOF. Her hair is longer, her cloths is beautiful. and her two fans will be with her during the whole out battle. With a cute introduction pose. She even prettier than KOF99 (sure, she is 10x better than she was in KOF2001). However, the character portraits could give some improvement. Not bad in terms of drawing, but the style doesn't give out the sense of beauty. But more or less it's up to players who decide this. I still prefer the KOF2000 artwork if you ask me.Gameplay is still the same way as the previous KOF games, you still fight, with power bar which you fight to build it up. And use the Desperation Moves or Super Desperation Moves to do a finishing move to a character, it's the same old way that KOF games that they ever provided. Except that now, Characters gained a Hidden Super Desperation Moves, which you have to activate it when you're low on life. And needed certain command to execute it. Not bad actually.Some of the old abilities like: Cancel, Autoguard, Backstep Jump, Rolling is back in this game. Surely, mastering the usage of those abilities will help tremendously on your fighting skills throughout the whole game. But those need some time to master it. For experienced KOF players, this never be a trouble for them. But for newbies, mastering them needs some time. Honed with those skills help you playing the versus mode easier, when you want to challenge someone into battle. Connecting Combo moves and end with a finishing move is a KOF players goal. That's what you've to do on it. Since you are more focused on combo's, not the basic Street Fighter II fighting style anymore.Music is somewhat downgraded. Although it is taken from the previous KOF songs, I still prefer the old theme. It feels like Eolith just take the theme from the previous games and simply rearranged it. But Arcade centers are usually noisy, you won't hear that so clearly. Try to buy the soundtrack if you want to. Voice acting is good. Character voice acting is changed, to much aggressive tone. But sometimes, you'll get annoyed. Have a rest if those bugged you too much.Loving this game is easy, replay this game is fun, but to master this game still needs your previous KOF experience and skills to play it. It's not easy if you ask me, the CPU's difficulty is tweaked, and your opponent is much smarter, and more difficult.Overall this game is provided the best gameplay so far, so it says ''Graphic doesn't matter much, gameplay must be fun and attractive.''. I rather Eolith refines the graphic and their artwork. If they do so, I would be definitely mad on this game.......Well, at least I do love Athena this year for now! ^_^Pros:---Good gameplay-Athena is prettier-New Abilities and Super powers, worth to try it out-New gameplay experienceCons:---Artwork needs improvement-Music-Difficulty is much higher than beforeOverall it has more pros. than cons. But overall it is a nice game. I can't complain much on this. Hop on, It's time to play KOF2002 again. In arcade!~"
,Recommended,222440,14833057,"Posted: 10 March, 2015",all,telos,"Like the King of Fighters '98 UM FE port on Steam, The King of Fighters 2002 UM port has decent netcode. I play with someone about halfway across the US and don't ever have any lag problems regardless of what the ping indicator says. Just making it that far is a struggle for the more poorly coded games, so I would assume it's good enough for continental US. Anyway, now that the most important thing is out of the way...While 98UM FE feels pretty much like '98 to me, 2002UM feels significantly different than the 2002 I'm used to. Admittedly I've always been more of a '98 person so my playtime on 2002 isn't that high but this version feels much faster and the controls more fluid than I remember. The balance too is definitely better and most of the characters feel improved over the way they were before rather than nerfed (though there are some exceptions!). I still feel like there are some weird hitboxes, but that's not a terribly big deal compared to psycho ball cheese.The presentation is improved, but there's only so much you can do with the ancient sprites. Whether portraits or menus pretty much everything is redrawn that isn't the actual sprites. There are new stages with cameos of other SNK characters too if you like that, but unfortunately no sort of filter to help alleviate your eyes of the pixels the size of your eyes for the actual sprites themselves.  More importantly though, the game also has an arranged soundtrack with the character themes in it. A pretty good one at that. It's one of the best additions for sure because the music Eolith put in 2002 was absolutely terrible.'98 may be a bit dated for people who didn't play fighting games before their revival with Street Fighter 4, but I feel this version of 2002 is definitely something that can be appreciated by both newer and older players alike. It's a much better port job than 98UM FE and a fast paced, exciting game. I'm hoping more classic fighters hit Steam soon."

,Recommended,222440,14682693,"Posted: 27 February, 2015",all,RX-0Banshee,"(My first-ever Steam review)The Steam version of the Xbox360 port of The King of Fighters 2002 Unlimited Match is great!  Having played KOF 2002 in the arcades  (back n 2002), KOF 2002 Unlimited Match for the Japanese Playstation 2 (which I still own), and the Xbox360 version of Unlimted Match (via Xbox Live), I can say that the Steam port is as good as the Xbox360 version it is based off of.  A handful of achievements and numerous 3vs3 and 1vs1 match options abound, but at the heart of it all, KOF 2002 Unlimted Match is a deep fighting game, yet decent online competitve experience.Those new to the King of Fighters series will find a MASSIVE roster of characters from which to choose from; each representing their own series from SNKPlaymore's extensive history of both fighting games and action-adventure titles.  From the Psycho Soldiers and the New Faces Team to multiple versions of Kyo Kusanagi and a completly revised K9999 (K-four nine) called ""Nameless"", Unlimited Match boasts a wealth of fighting styles and over-the-top moves to utilize against your opponents.  Offline, controls are sharp and responsive which means that special and desperation moves require precise motions to successfully execute (using a comtroller or arcade stick is highly recommended).  Combos are fairly easy to pull off and juggle combos abound.Online, however, is where the port takes its beating.  As with nearly every fighting game that isn't say, Skullgirls, lag is and will be an issue.  Whether it actually works, there are a few online options that you can tweak in the options menu to reduce input lag (from 1 to 9) and see the input lag measured on-screen for your convenience.  Some matches will be decent, while others will be slow and painful to play; if you have been playing fighting games on Steam for a while, then it will be nothing new.As for this port, everything from the console version has been replicated flawlessly (including the widescreen boarders, which you can change via a few options).  Graphics-wise, there are a standard host of resolutions and sprite sharpening options to suit your preferences; however, keep in mind that the Steam version is based of a game from over a decade ago, so the graphics will obviously have aged...badly, when compared to other fighting games.  The Endless Mode is simply a survival mode, while Challenge Mode requires you to master character combos with the utmost precision and skill to advance to the next challenge.  Rounding this out is a completely ""new"" soundtrack (the arcade version of 2002 had a different soundtrack) that hosts great remixes of famous themes while adding many new arrangements.Overall, The King of Fighters 2002 Unlimited Match is a great fighting game for local versus play, but for online, the lag and latency hurt it and keep it from being a top-tier option for those wanting to prove their online superiority against others.  Only time will tell if the port developers continue to fix the and tweak the netcode to where it is good enough to make the majority of players happy."

,Recommended,222440,22851768,"Posted: 7 May, 2016",all,IvanLeTerrible,"THE BEST KOF EVER! (In my humble opinion, of course)I dont know, but I fell like my review is going to be biased by the fact that I played a lot of this game back in the days it was released, so its a game very dear to me, and seeing it back here on Steam in this improved version is so amazing!The RosterFirst, you should know that this is not the regular version of KOF 2002, but the Unlimited Match version, which includes tons of extra features. One of them is the expanded roster, which includes not only the original KOF2002 chars, but also each and every char from KOF 99 to KOF 2002. So, chars like Kasumi, Heidern, Shingo and many others were add to the cast, making the character selection screeen became HUGE!The GameplayThe gameplay of a Kof game is basically a faster and furious version of Street Fighter. Its very combo heavy and demands a lot of practice from the player. So be prepared to spend a lot of time in the training mode practicing your set ups and combos, because the players you will find online do it a lot. Also, as I said before, this version contains aditional features, which are some new moves and specials for many chars, so it will surprise the kof veterans a bit, in a good way.The Online PlayThe whole point of a fighting game in the era of the internet is to play online, as most local arcades have closed down. So Kof 2002 UM includes an online play feature, with both Player Matches (casual) and Ranked Matches. But here is the thing: there are only a few players online and you will only find random online fighters on the weekends. Most of the online play in this game is made via your own friend list. That is: you add people from your country our nearby countries and, when they are online, you ask them to play with you. Thats how the online play has been working for the kof games here on Steam. ITS NOT DEAD, it just works the way I described.Final VeredictOverall its a pretty solid fighting game made for those who are really into the genre and like a fast paced fighter. Its also a classic game from the arcade era and playing it might be very nostalgic to some (like me). This Unlimited Match version actually improves the game a lot by adding new features like more chars, moves and the online mode, thus making the game even better.I rate it 9.0 / 10.0"

Hoping KOF2003 also gets a re release as I rather not have to hook up the xbox anymore just to play it.02 and 03 were the last titles to be on the yearly release plan and they did the job nicely.Beyond these they went into numbered sequels and 11 didn't grab me quite as well,12 the move list was dry and with no Mai, and 13 made meter management a bit odd with having to manage 2 and the combination of the two even for the better moves and one it the other often short of allowing you to truely shine.  OTHER than the bar issue the roster, look, colors customization, are good examples of how a 2d fighter should play.DON'T let the may sayers fool you, 14 is great. Nothing wrong with it's play it visuals, a quality much better combat wise and reaction time wise than SFV, and the visuals got a significant upgrade for people who actually look close.This game here though, a great show of what we use to play in KOF and though visuals aren't what some like as much, the gameplay is there, and the details of the characters reach far beyond just their pixels.Long live true character in or characters, and back stories that power a great ongoing universe that continues into the future, characters, and places alike, growing in legacy.Here's to the heroes of Old South Town."

The controls are spot on and this game has the biggest roster out of any KOF.  Many characters also have additional moves they didn't have in the original NEOGEO game which is great.  If they had included the original KOF 2k2 (like they did with 98UM) and added a gallery mode and color edit mode it would have been even better.Online is a mixed bag.  Not many matches to be found in the lobby and when you do find a match it's often laggy depending on the location of your opponent.  As others have said your best option is to friend players who live close to you; that way its possible to play games with little to no lag which is great!

Playing with people in far off distant lands lands delays relative between ISP and distance but whats important is the netcode isn't unstable, doesn't time out for no reason, doesn't teleport lag (telelag) doesn't stutter, doesn't take forever to connect, doesn't read inacurately, doesn't crash the game.  Unfortunately, SNK took too long to get this to steam PC for it to pick up a playerbase local to north america to have any constant flow of players to fight with.  It's a desert out there.  Your games will consist of having friends to play with from time to time of which when you do, and if they're not on the polar end of the globe with average internet service, it will play like a dream come true.  That's what's important.  It doesn't require any servers other them steam and steamworks as 3rd party to function so it will never die out.  You can pick it up and dust it off anytime steam functions and play online.On top of that they improved 2002 ver of KOF in various aspects and tweaks gameplay wise so it's even better then before.98' and '02 are my fav of the KOF series from SNK's 2D fighter franchise.I'd recommend this when it's on sale and not the full price.  Why?  Emulated community-maintained online versions of this game and earlier SNK and CP2 titles have way way more interesting online features and more online player support per match then what's offered in this one.Like what? I donno about FIGHTCADE but Mame32K, Mame64K and Mame32++ offer way more control customization, ROM customization, tweakable settings and most importantly, offer MORE THEN 6 PLAYERS ONLINE in match.  They even offer multiplayer support for single-player campaigns allowing you to online emulate with up to 3 of your friends a co-op campaign against AI.  Or 3 vs 3 online (like KOF 14 now has!) + spectators too not to mention online training mode.  The K in Mame32K stands for kaillera and doesn't offer the best multiplayer sync code in the world.  It desyncs can hang and freeze emulator and sound like a broken record till u ctrl+alt+del it, but when it works it's the best thing ever.Ever.Forever.It will never get old as a result.  Donno if FIGHTCADE and GGPO and RomStation.fr have such unique co-op and 6 player online features, but they def have more stable netcode then kaillera.King of Fighters XIV has learned from the community and incorporated 3vs3 online, online training mode, as well as the most stable netcode i've ever seen in my life.I'd recommend KOF14 over this KOF02 UM due to online features.  Yes it's quite a different game over '02 in terms of newer mechanics and characters missing a lot of their classic move-sets from '98, '99, '00, '01, '02 ,'03 etc (a trend that KOF13 started) prob due to balance reasons, but once u get used to it, it's the♥♥♥♥♥♥  It's really ♥♥♥♥ing good.Get KOF '02 UM when it's on sale simply because anyone that plays KOF14 or KOF in general will always eventually want to nostalgia online with friends some KOF '02 or KOF'98 and so on, on steam for stable play.  It almost always happens and you would want to be privy to that situation when it lines up with your friends and have the game accessible to play in your library.Heck, if you leave the lobby public and open long enough you will get more players joining, happy as a clam they searched at the right time online, play against you, add you to friends list and then you'll have more excuses to go play KOF '02 UM.For any KOF fan, it's a good way to pay tribute to SNK for the great fighting games they made and give them any excuse whatsoever to continue to keep considering awesome ports to PC as much as possible.  Get it on sale so it's worth ur money, get it in general cuz it's worth ur time.  It's a solid port, end of story."

This version added more rosters from predecessors (correct me if I am wrong) and game tweaks. The fighting mechanics work well, but they're missing the juggle from the console version which is my favourite thing in fighting games genre. They added the multiplayer as well but the community is dead anyway. Controllers are welcome as well.+ Pros+ Added fighters from predecessors+ Around 50 rosters+ Endless Mode+ Controller support+ 2 player support split screen (one with keyboard and controller or 2 controllers for fair match)+ Satisfying MAX2 moves- Cons- Juggling is missing- Tough boss fight (Even when you put CPU level 3 on Options)- Multiplayer is dead- Skill List seems to be weird (There are some Russian language for other fighters and some complex MAX2 moves for some fighters)Around 50 rosters, MAX2 moves for comeback and Endless mode seems to be a great addition, but they miss out the juggle mechanic on PC version which is what I was really disappointed. But that doesn't mean the game is unenjoyable. Overall, it is really hard to recommend for newcomers and KOF veterans on this version. This is probably the only fighting game I would spend on while waiting for Tekken 7 coming on PC or console if it's not going to happen. I would recommend Street Fighter, Skullgirls, Blazblue, Guilty Gear and King of Fighters XIII if you want a decent fighting game on PC."

While this game is a big upgrade to a previous game, I could not help but compare the difference between it's predecessor KOF02 for the neo geo and this game KOF02UM.The Pros:- Excellent soundtrack for each team and boss characters- the teams seem to have their own stages.- The bosses from KOF99 to KOF01 are present and playable- The characters not found in KOF02 such as Lin, May Lee and Jhun are here in KOF02UM- Many different modes to choose from such as practice, challenge and online- certain artwork opens when you win against Rugal as a team- Most MAX2 moves are changed.  They are easier to remember and perform now.- Some characters' moves or properties have been changed or added.  EX - Heidern's Neck Rolling is now unblockable.  EX- Xiang Fei's super is a string of commands.The Cons:- Bosses can be overwhelmingly difficult.- The win quotes for each character are the same no matter who you win against.  EX - Ralf has a certain quote when he wins against a female on the last round in KOF02.  It does not show any personality for the characters.- There is no gallery for the artwork [as far as I see].  As far as artwork is concerned, I like it in color but that is personal preference.- You only get one chance against Rugal- no story/background for each team.  Need to find external source to read about it.  If they added it as unlockable material in this game, then it would be amazing in my opinion.- In KOF98 and previous games, your teammates would be in the background cheering their team.

Lots of characters, nice looking backgrounds, and great music, and various game modes to keep you distracted. If you have some friends or siblings who are also into KoF, well i don't think the game will be getting stale any time soon since the amount of characters in this game gives you a infinate amount of teams you could have in the Vs. mode.Oh yeah. and all the boss characters are unlocked already in this version. In the Xbox Live Arcade version you had to play through Endless Mode, or Arcade Mode and defeat that specific character. So if ya suck. you don't have to worry about it.And if you didn't know already. Some characters have alternate versions of themselves if you hold the Start button on that character and choose them. Examples would be, Kensou (KoF '99), Robert (KoF '99 to 2000), and the entire Orochi Team."

Decent netcode if you stay continental. Just don't be rebuted by character graphics and you'll find a deep game.Long version :this game is an updated kof2002. Some characters return from previous years, some had changes. Also, it incorporates the latests tweaks from arcade version.The base system is from 2002 (max mode, super cancels, max supers, max2 supers), however some important tweaks allow better overall balance and usefulness.Max and Max2 supers are doable directly, outside of max mode, for 1 additional bar (so 3 bars in total). This makes some Max and Max2 much more useful and relevent, like Maxima Max Maxima Revenger and Max Arch enemy, Takuma Max2 reversal or Angel Max reversal because you don't have to enter max mode.Super during max mode doesn't cost another bar, it simply ends max mode. Also a super cancel during max mode also doesn't cost bar, so a combo in max mode like normal>special>supercancel-super would only cost 1 bar for entering max mode.Quick Max still costs 2 levels total (1 for cancel, 1 for max mode).All the above plus the numerous tweaks on characters movesets make the game extremelly well balanced.There are 66 characters in total. Not including bosses which have more health and unfair movesets, and counting alternate versions, this leaves a total of 61 characters, which is nothing short of staggering.Background graphics are nice, if a little flat because they use 2D.Character graphics are probably the game's weak point. They're blocky and worst of all the filtering options don't do a lot.Because the game is 2D, it's requirements are very low, and even low end laptops can play it fine.Sound is great with good voice and effect quality and numerous themes remixes.Controls are top notch, use of a gamepad or an arcade stick is heavily recommended. Works with direct input devices (AKA many gamepads and PS3 wired sticks and pads).Netcode is good if you manage to stay under 350ms of ping. Find players within your continent and you'll be fine.The game has also local versus play of course.For me, it's the best fighting game to this day. It's only held back by outdated character graphics, but don't let that detract you from the immense depth this game has."

To see a masterpiece completely remade and brought into Steam. This game is perfect for those fans who are looking for that nostalgic feel of 2D fighters, while enjoying fast paced battles with very good music to help induce the hype.The graphics have been improved, the gameplay as well (to a very good extent) and you have a huge roster of 66 characters to choose from (including bosses and EX versions of a few characters!), all unlocked from the start!Not only that, but the achievements in this game are a real challange to get, giving the feel that you are actually achieving something worth fighting for! What more could you ask for?The only things in this game that may be a reason to complain are: The controls aren't really that good for the keyboard (you will most likely have a hard time with difficult inputs such as Nameless' Rasen super) and you will often see yourself playing with more simple characters like Iori, Ralf or the Kyo Clones (which, in my opinion were a really good adition for those who like Kyo's old design and moveset better).There is no story in this game, making it simply a character mosh pit (much like Marvel Vs. Capcom 2 though this games' roster is bigger) so fans who wish to get to know their favourites will probably be disappointed.And don't think you can play this as you would Street Fighter, or else you're going to have a hard time! ;)In the end...I give this a solid: 9\10!"

The sprite filter options are here but have minimal effect.As said elsewhere in the review section, there is a distinct ""line"" around the sprites, hightened even more by the fact that the backgrounds in this port have been forced into hi-rez.The screen scrolling, as your character moves left and right, suffers from judder, despite constant frame rate.All this makes your inputs feel laggy.I have seen others point out these problems in the reviews and they get thumbed down.Likewise, in the forums, they get accused of not appreciating ""pixel art"".The issue is not a lack of love for pixels.

The roster of 2002 is way bigger than in XIII, (there are 66 fighters for you to pick!) i really like the pixelated style of the game and many characters got an overhaul by getting new moves added to their moveset.The controls are fluent, the special moves are easy to remember and use and i also like the fact that it actually makes a difference if you do a special move with either a light kick or a hard kick, that adds a lot more strategy to the fights.The netcode of this game is a mixed bag, sometimes the netcode is really good, the game is fluent but other times the game runs really slow and / or choppy, but most of the time it's good. You can also see the ping difference between you and the guy you want to play against in the lobby, so if the ping is too high, you can still leave or kick the guy.The developers are also very close to the community, they patch the game regulary and the community as a whole is very helpful.So overall, if you enjoy fighting games with a huge variety of characters and a very high learning curve (and if you are not afraid to get your♥♥♥♥♥handed to you online) get this game.

I don't want to come across as arrogant, but I know what i'm talking bout when it comes to 2D fighters.REAL REVIEW FOLLOWSPros:+Great soundtracks+Huge roster with very diverse characters+Amazing online play+Nostalgiac pixelated graphics+Smooth gameplay+Steam Trading Cards :)Cons:-Small number of online players-No story/career mode (not really a problem with endless, team play and challange)First of all, the all important graphics. While the pixelated arcade fighter graphics may be a major turn off for some people- and believe me, I initially didn't want to buy a pixelated fighter, however my graphics card would not allow that- it really, REALLY works with the game. You really get the feeling of playing a traditional 2D fighter. Once you start getting into the game, it really doesn't bother you. You want the pixelated graphics. You want the artwork border. And you want it to be hard to tell if a character is half nude or not (helps a lot when a parent comes in the room ;)Online gameplay is amazingly smooth. If you have a lower end computer, you may experience very minimal lag, otherwise you'll play as if it was you versus the AI. There's actually a setting to limit the amount of frame lag there can possibly be in your match. The only problem is that there aren't too many players online all the time. Try playing later in the day, or grab a friend.Now for the actual gameplay. KoF 2002 UM's mechanics and responsiveness is golden. Never have i had a game related problem with playing the game, not even online. This means maybe I messed up a combo move, but i've never had the game cause me to mess it up. Every character is balanced and equally powerful in my opinion. Some moves are more powerful than others, some more annoying than others. But that's one of the main components of a fighting game: every character is different and takes a different level of skill to master. There are some characters designed for veteran players- namely May, who has two different play modes in one- and some designed for beginners- namely Bao, who has a very simple moveset.The actual roster is expansive, much larger than most fighting games including SSF4:AE, with 66 playable characters. About 60 if you discount the Orochis and secret form characters. For younger players, players with protective parents or Muslims (like me), most of the females are actually dressed decently, and I would confidently play as them in front of my parents. Stay away from Angel♥, Mai, Vice, Mature, Blue Mary, Leona, Foxy, Vanessa and Shermie. If you choose Hinako, be aware that she may panty flash you at the beginning of the match.Just about every other aspect of the game is perfect. This is a great purchase for fighter fans and those looking for an exuse to smash their best friend's face in. If overpriced at all, I would say only by about a cent. Maybe 2 cents. If you really don't want to pay full price, grab it on sale. I got my copy and a friend's for about 6$.Thanks for reading my long♥ss review. Goodl uck becoming the the King of Fighters! Take it easy!

Boasting a huge roster of over sixty characters, all with different movesets, beautifully designed stages and a deep combo system, KOF02UM is easily the pick of KOF games on Steam and in general, 'Unlimited' is definitely a word that's perfect for the game, due to how big it is.2002 Unlimited is an expansion of the Dream Match game The King of Fighters 2002, both games have no story, but the single player experience is still very fresh while keeping things ""KOF"". There are Arcade modes for both 3v3 and 1v1, as well as challenges, an endless mode, as well as free Player vs CPU battles, and of course, a mode that allows you to practice and perfect your skills and special moves.The multiplayer experience is just as expansive, allowing both Team and Single battles online and offline, something not available in most KOF games. Though SNK Playmore isn't known for providing the best netplay experience, it's definitely worth a shot, especially if you have a friend to play Player Match with.The sprites, although pretty retro, still hold up quite well now, with some nice shading detail and coloring and a pretty range of palettes. The stages are beautifully designed and the music is enough to get any player pumped for a three on three rumble.Despite a couple of downsides [lack of color editor and plot.], 02UM has many hours of gameplay to offer, while keeping to what's truly KOF and not blowing new players off of their feet with too much to do. Whether or not you're trying to get into KOF, or you've played it before and you're looking for more, 2002 Unlimited is the next direction to go by far."

One downside would be that the controls may take time to get used to without a controller or else it can become a bit of a nightmare when fighting. Also, during online matches your screen MAY freeze up depending on how strong your connection is while playing (but that's probably just my own issue). There's enough to do here to keep you occupied for a good 5-10 hrs.

This game, with its massive and nostalgic roster, will help me. The music's pretty great, too--my only complaint is how the Orochi characters seem to share a single BGM, and it's not my favourite one."
