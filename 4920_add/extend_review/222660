,Recommended,222660,8064240,"Posted: 15 December, 2013",all,MrNinjaSquirrel,"A rhythm game disguised as a side-scrolling shooter, or a side-scrolling shooter that plays like a rhythm game, Retro/Grade brings a refreshing twist to the Guitar Hero note catching gameplay that has long since worn thin for most people. As the cheeky Rick Rocket you begin the game at the end as you fire the last bullet into a formidable robot and save the galaxy from certain doom, only to plunge into a time vortex mere seconds later. Now you have to move backwards in time undoing your past deeds in order to keep the time continuum in tack (and more importantly Rick's reputation).Lucky for you it seems Rick and the enemies he fought have a musical mind about them and have timed every shot and movement to the notes of songs, which is where you come in. For anyone who's played a Guitar Hero, Rock Band, or Dance Dance Revolution game this is going to feel right at home. Color coded bullets and obstacles come at you from the side of the screen, and you need to hit them in time with the beat and melody of the song to clear them. Where Retro/Grade differentiates itself is that while you are clearing your own notes (read: bullets) you also need to be dodging the enemies attacks as well, which range from lasers to giant robot legs to maze like bullet patterns and more. It's hard to truly understand just how it works until you've played it yourself, but it's the sort of idea that is so inherently brilliant that it makes you wonder how no one came up with it before.Retro/Grade's soundtrack is atypical of the games it emulates,. A collection of electro tracks with a serious groove to them, full of catchy riffs and fantastic breakdowns, it's impossible not to bob your head to the beat along with Rick. And what music game is complete without flashy epilepsy inducing visuals? The presentation on the whole is top notch, and the little details like the way enemies reconstruct themselves as you fly backwards and bullets suck themselves back into the barrels they came from add a lot of character.I do have one major problem, and that is there is both too much and too little here. There are only ten tracks to play, which while I wouldn't say any are bad, even the best songs become tiresome after you have heard it twenty times over a few hours. I also felt that the actual tracks dragged on longer than I would have liked, which is made worse by the repeating backgrounds going on behind you.Going through story mode will likely take you under an hour to complete, but what is irritating is that you can't raise your difficulty without starting over from the first stage. There are challenge levels which unlock after you have completed the campaign, but here the repetition of the soundtrack becomes hard to ignore as there are dozens of challenges to complete all utilizing the same pool of songs. Had the existing tracks been cut short and a few more added I would have likely completed a lot more of them, but after a while I began to resent the game for making me replay what felt like the same stage again and again.Because of the short tracklist it is a bit hard to recommend Retro/Grade at full price, but at a discount it is definitely something worth checking out. The basic ideas are very clever and I found it a lot of fun despite lacking much staying power. Although my preferred way to play was with an old guitar controller, you can certainly manage with either a controller or keyboard (albeit on lower difficulty settings), and each provides an interesting dynamic. If you were among the many who lamented the decreased innovation and change in the Guitar Hero games but never quite got sick of basic gameplay you will likely find Retro/Grade to be a very pleasant surprise."

A regular controller works very well up to about medium difficulty, but I had some trouble with the higher difficulties in having to sequentially switch multiple lines very quickly, where the guitar's instantaneous any-line switching made things a lot easier and enjoyable.  Keyboard control is another option, and might actually be a better option than a regular controller, now that I think about it..Really great music, dazzling graphics, intricate details, even more impressive that it came from a 2-person dev team.  One of them has a really interesting GDC talk about the obsessive development process and the effects it had on his personal life, linked from the ""Did this game really sell so poorly?"" thread in the game's Steam forum, a recommended watch regardless of interest in this particular game."

It's a good really fun rhythm game, with an amazing soundtrack.  I don't think there was a song I disliked.  The object of the game is to undue your projectiles, so that you can save time or something,  It's really fun, not too difficult.  There are 6 difficulty settings ranging from beginner to X-treme.  The campaign on normal took me 2 hours, but the other 10 hours came from the challenge mode, which were boring at first because they were easy.  But then the difficulty gets so high, 5 levels away from the goal you have to perfectly do X-treme tracks, which requires a lot of repetitive practice, and if you are playing the game daily you will get that.  At first if you start up the game and look at the extreme level of tracks you'll be amazed at the difficulty level, but through challenge mode you'll be impressed at your ability to eventually be able to do what you thought was impossible, so very rewarding I say.  For 10$ it's a great game just for the music alone, but the gameplay is also great.  If you do not like rhythm games though it's not for you.  I recommend this game easily."

It has a great, original concept and the soundtrack is wonderful.EDIT: The game seemed very difficult at first due to its unorthodox gameplay, but I grasped the controls quickly and the first three difficulty levels (there are six in total) were a breeze. I now have to beat the last two, and now I wish I had a guitar controller :)The challenge mode is also very satisfying. Their difficulites vary greatly as well. There are only 10 tracks in the whole game, but the challenge mode does manage to spice up the game. The challenges are not necessarily ""more difficult"" than their corresponding campaign levels - sometimes they are easier, sometimes they make you wonder ""...is that even possible??"".Also, if you have FPS problems you can just try listening to the music and keep the beats without concentrating too much on the screen instead of meddling with your settings.Oh, and completing all of the Steam Achievements is very, very difficult (practically impossible for me, but I don't know about you, dear possibly-obsessive-shooter-loving-review-reading-person.

,Recommended,222660,16724821,"Posted: 26 June, 2015",all,Maxmetpt,"This is a really good rhythm game! It suffers from a number of issues, but it's still worth your time and money, if you're into this genre.The graphics are very well done, but they're too obtrusive, often obscuring vital information. It's strange to see such a big focus on the graphics, when rhythm games function almost without any graphics. It's about timing and precision. The game has several little details on bosses and backgrounds that are lost, since you can't be appreciating how pretty a game looks when playing a game of this type that requires lots of concentration.Oh well. It does have some options to disable effects and add guide-lines, so the problem can be diminished.The game only has 10 songs, and thus, 10 levels on the campaign. While that may sound very little, take in mind that there are 6 difficulty settings, which creates different levels, effectively. It also have a very extensive challenge system. Too extensive, honestly. The challenges are the same levels as in the campaign, but they start in lower difficulties, and progressively introduce higher ones. They also change rules and unlock a ton of extras. They change color lanes, mirror things, some require perfect timing, etc. etc. Very cool!However, having 130 challenges does get painfully slow.The biggest problem, in my opinion, is how the game never explains itself very well. It's a big issue regarding controls and higher difficulties. While it supports Guitar, Controller and Keyboard, using Keyboard is almost impossible in the 2 highest difficulties.I was playing with a controller. It was wonderful. The controls were perfectly timed with the songs, and it felt really good! Until I reached that difficulty wall. So, I tried to find my guitar hero controller and play with it. Well, at that point, it was very difficult to transition between the 2 controllers, with wildly different control methods.I had to go back a few difficulty levels and relearn everything, with a less interesting game, as the levels were slower than what I was used it.All of that could have been avoided if the game was more transparent. Unfortunately, since it didn't do well on Playstation, the developer decided to shift focus away from the guitar... which was a poor decision, in my opinion.So yeah, it's not perfect. There's a song that has an awkward transition, but all of the rest are really fun to play! They all have different sections, connecting the songs with the levels very nicely.It's not a genre that we see often on PC, so definitely give it a go, it's great!P.S.: I played 10.6 hours without any issue of this sort, but the game just reset my progress after this whole time. I was only playing the challenges at this point, and was pretty far into it. I didn't feel like doing it all again, so I decided to just drop the game.Still very much enjoyed my time with it!"

,Recommended,222660,21914843,"Posted: 18 March, 2016",all,Nao,"This is a ""Thumbs in the middle"" review:This is quite an underrated game imo. I've been a fan ever since the 2008 IGF demo and still keep coming back to the game every now and then. There are certainly better rhythm games, some of which are free, but there's plenty worse and few are as unique or as visually stunning as this one is.The basic principle of the game is that not only are you playing a rhythm game, but you are also playing a shoot em up (in reverse!) which means you have to dodge enemy bullets coming from behind you at the same time as trying to hit the beats in front of you. This forces you to play different as you can't always line up in advance to hit the next beat; you may have to swerve around an incoming bullet. Sometimes there are sections of the song entirely based around avoiding enemy bullets giving you a slight break from all the chaos whilst still keeping you on your toes. It's a simple addition which adds a lot of depth and challenge to the game.For me the difficulty felt just fine. It starts easy enough and steadily progresses harder. You are afforded plenty of mistakes and you can even rewind so it's very forgiving. There's two modes: Story mode and challenge mode. Story mode is just a straight progression through the game's 10 levels whilst challenge mode offers over 100 challenges with various stipulations such as playing at a faster speed or playing the track mirrored. The problem is that progress in one does not affect the other; story progress does not unlock challenges. If you complete the story, you'll have to start from the very beginning with very easy challenges for a long while before you can unlock challenging ones on par with the last mission.And while it looks beautiful, the visuals are sometimes a bit too much especially with songs that use all 5 lanes. Even with beat lines enabled it is sometimes hard to tell what's going on. However I find using the mono cheat which changes all the beats to one color and enemy bullets another significantly improves visibility and I would highly recommend it if you have issues. And the music is well composed but it's not very exciting and there are only 10 tracks.But it's still a lot of fun. It's very mechanically solid and well polished. It supports pretty much any controller including a Guitar Hero or Rock Band guitar. An awful lot of work was put into this game and for the most part it shows. For what it is and considering all the free rythm games out there, $10 may seem a bit steep for what you get, especially if you're not into the music. I'd love to see a sequel but sadly due to how poorly this sold I doubt we'll be seeing any."

,Recommended,222660,8343828,"Posted: 27 December, 2013",all,Slump,"Retro/Grade is a game that I was not expecting. Browsing through the games on Steam, I came upon this game, and after watching the video, I had to purchase it immediately. If you've ever been a fan of side scrolling shooters, rhythm games, or even just colorful games that give your eyeballs this wonderful explosion of bright vivid colors that would satisfy even the most skeptical player. It's so much fun to watch, and even more fun to play.This game is a very pattern oriented reverse rhythm shooter, and it's the only game like it out there. This is why it needs to be played.There are various levels of difficulty as one can imagine in a game like this. The easiest mode starts out on three planes of the field, being able to switch between them at any time, and the goal is to dodge the missiles that are coming from behind you as the level reverses, but at the same time, you are re-absorbing the shots you fired at the enemies. It is more intense than it sounds, but the good kind. The kind that makes one want to continue to play. As you advance further into the game, the beats become more abundant, and more things start happening on the screen as you have more planes to play from, all the way up to six in total, making the game a veritable bevy of colorful explosions.If Arcade mode doesn't tickle your fancy, then there is always the fun of challenge mode, where you advance through a map that is a specific stage where you must complete the objective. This can range from getting a specific amount of Greats, to not going below a specific score for the level, and even being required to have a certain rank upon completing the level. As you play these challenges, you also unlock other things in the game, like more ships, cheat modes (Disco mode is my absolute favorite) and stage music unlocked to play in the jukebox. There is a great amount of stages to play, so you will never be bored with this game.For what you pay for this game, you're getting a great amount of content. Every time I find myself looking for something to play, I almost always go for Retro/Grade first because it's easy to pick up, play and put back down to come back to later, and if you're like me, you keep on coming back to it, months and months later."
,Recommended,222660,7919789,"Posted: 4 December, 2013",all,TJF588,"STEAMY AWARDS ""I THOUGHT THIS GAME WAS COOL BEFORE IT WON AN AWARD"" NOMINEEIf you enjoy lane-based rhythm games, get this as soon as you can. This game deserves a much higher player base.Where to start? Well, obviously the aesthetics. This game is a visual splendor, due primarily to its backdrops (ever seen the sunset undone over a cityscape?), with its variety of projectiles lighting up around you, especially when you're in overdrive. Overdrive also intensifies the music up, down, & sideways, in a soundtrack that's already ""groovy"" overall. These tracks, available at 24 Carat Games' Bandcamp, stand strong on their own, most being the type of music that carries you along with it, syncing well with the gameplay, your hands, and involuntarily your body. Even at the first stage, this game secures its presentation, and playing on a laptop with headphones has only allowed me to appreciate it more. (For the less powerful machines out there, there's a few preset performance options, though you can select or deselect features as you will.)Now, the gameplay? Truth told, this IS my personal purpose of a guitar controller, and after discovering this capability in the options menu and laughably trying it out, I'd be reticent to play it any other way. (Note that switching to any lane is instantaneous on a guitar (and I assume the same of the keyboard), but is done one at a time on a gamepad.) I am not good at Guitar Hero (save for its ""just strum the bar"" easiest mode, which is boring), but Retro/Grade has a wide range of difficulty levels, from two lanes with modest notes to all five jam-packed. I doubt I'd ever bring myself to handle that level, but between the campaign and the challenges (with a tutorial and full practise mode alongside), I have surprised myself with my risen capability. The base gameplay involves ""undoing"" the character, Rick's, actions in what appears to be a horizontal ""shmup"", by intercepting your shots (by strumming the bar after lining yourself up) and reverse-dodging enemy fire. The feedback for messing up (distorting the timeline, where Rick had performed perfectly; the scant story to this game is a humorous read, both in scenario and composition) is clear, and you have the limited capability of forwarding yourself back in time to re-attempt undoing your non-mistake. The overdrive mentioned is this game's version of ""star power"", and ramps up the presentation and boosts your score decrements (remember, undoing things, here); the game defaults this function to the guitar's Select button and tilt function, but I'd recommend a controller with a dedicated button (such as just under your wrist). The focal projectiles, yours and your enemies, vary -- from bursts, beams, and barrages on your side to bursts, spreadshots, and frickin' black holes on theirs -- and the many challenges task you to added conditions, such as no errors, single or shifting color schemes, alternate speeds, and even the original pattern of an already tricky boss.**Because of the scheme of ""reversed shmup"", there are projectiles coming from both (or neither, for black holes) directions -- yours from the right, enemies' from the left -- which adds to the activity on-screen and especially as the difficulty risies requires an acute awareness from the player. The beauty of this is, as the game gradually demonstrates, dodging is as much set to the music as the target notes are, and even moving from lane to lane carries a rhythm, eventually allowing you to confidently skim just barely around obstacles as you become accustomed to the music. Still, keep wary, as the bright nature of the visuals could lead to overlooking a projectile 'til it's on top of you.For the rest, there are unlockable galleries (photo sets and the music for use in a turntable*), ships (one of the earliest is a T-rex from Go Home Dinosaurs!), and ""cheats"" (such as an aptly-inflated head...), all via the challenge mode. There are also visibility options, both in turning off the aforementioned effects and in making the notes denoted. And, for you score-seekers, there's a leaderboard for anything but individual challenges (the challenge mode, IIRC, just uses a points system rather than specific score).tl;dr - This game is great on its own, and when paired with the guitar controller becomes something even its designated games could envy outside of party purposes.*As of my last attempt, I couldn't get the turntables to start, as they weren't reacting to my green button, nor the mouse, though the latter may've been functionally superceded by the former.--- --- ---If I were to compare to other games (aside from GH/RB, due to prefered controller), I might say...- Skullgirls' accessibility (more via gameplay than extensive tools)- Shatter's aesthetics (esp. as paired with arcade gameplay)- Audiosurf's basic interface (primarily for targets; obstaces are from behind**)"

I'm not convinced they did ANY of those things, since the shooter part is messy, the stage music is boring, the action barely registers as rhythmic, and to rub it in, THEY PLAY THE STAGE MUSIC FORWARDS. I mean, really. That twist was just handed to them and they dropped it.I recommend this game only to people who liked Bit Trip Beat but thought it should have been less about the chiptunes and more about the visual headache.

However, the mixing of rhythm game mechanics with a shoot-em-up game moving *backwards* through time was quite a brilliant and original idea. There are other mechanics layered on top of this, such as the time warp ability which lets you undo events (oddly, by moving *forward* through time), that make it even further removed from traditional games of the rhythm genre.The original music score is great.  The graphics are very slick and offer a light show that syncs with the beat, and overall the game feels very polished.That being said however, the game gets a bit too disorienting at times with all the colors on screen flashing at once, especially in higher difficulty settings or during more complex challenges.  Luckily this isn't a problem if you play at lower difficulty settings and avoid the challenges.The only issues I've had, besides the occasional ""epilepsy-inducing"" light shows, is getting the audio beats and visual hits to line up.  There are thankfully audio and video adjustment options that help with timing, but it can be tricky to get it working perfectly.  Its worth visiting these menu options especially if you have audio or visual latency issues, the former of which can be amplified by having DTS or DD surround sound encoding on, and the latter which can be dependent on the type of monitor, graphics card, and even cable length you have.Overall, this is one of my favorite ""original concept"" games."

I like the stage design, the concept, the art, and the surprising amount of content (in challenge mode). And yeah, at first I enjoyed it. But very quickly it begins to feel like a chore. It's like every stage is the same thing but with different layouts and visuals, and it feels like it takes forever to end.The basic gameplay is a rhythm game. Hit keys when a note comes at the right time. But now, let's add some dodging to that mechanic. So now you have to avoid hitting notes coming from another direction. Okay. Now we add in different styles of notes, like sustaining or button mashing. Then we add more stuff to dodge but on the opposing side as well. As you can see, things can get a little out of hand quickly. You must keep track of stuff coming from behind you, in front of you, above and below you, hit keys at the right time, hold keys at the right time, mash keys at the right time, the list goes on. This isn't a complaint, mind you, it's just a precaution of what to expect.For the masochists out there, you can go set the game to higher difficulty settings, and the game becomes devilishly hard, as you need to keep track of many lanes and lights coming from both sides of the screen.The campaign was all right. I liked the humor about doing everything in reverse. I would have liked a deeper story, but I understand it's not that sort of game. Oddly, if you go right to the challenge modes after completing the campaign, you are met with a bunch of super easy stages until you finally work your way to the harder ones, which take far more time and effort than the entire campaign itself.I'm unsure if this game actually has Cloud support or not. The store page says it does, but in my library it doesn't show support, nor does it sync after the game ends. I suspect it did at one point, and then vanished.Given that it's a rhythm game, then the single most important thing about it would have to be the music. This is arguably the game's weakest point. I do believe the monotony of the stages would have been acceptably fun if the music was good and varied. In its current state, most of the songs sound similar to each other, and playing each one for several minutes quickly creates a droning state of mind where you're just going through the motions, but not really feeling it. Heck, maybe even do a few vocal tracks.Despite my criticisms, I appreciate what the dev tried to create here. I feel it should have performed much better than it did, and hopefully others will stumble onto it as I did. I'm recommending the game because I feel the dev has talent and can make something truly special in the future."

It's a horizontal-scrolling space shoot-em-up rhythm game played in reverse.No, I'm not kidding. That's actually the concept for this game -- and it actually works. It's fun to play! I only wish there were more than 10 stages. The Challenge mode helps with the length of this game, and having a half-dozen difficulties doesn't hurt, but still.. only 10 songs plus the tutorial is a little rough.One of the neatest features of this game is the ability to use a guitar controller to play it. If only I had one! I can definitely see how using a guitar would make the higher difficulties much easier -- but you can still play using your keyboard or a gamepad, so fret not (see what I did there?)!Definitely worth checking out as a strange little indie rhythm game, especially for a low pricepoint."

Even could be enjoyable for Guitar Hero/Rock Band fans if you like electronic music. The appearance of a shoot em up is mostly only an avenue for beat based rhythm game. While you must tap ""fire"" on the beat of the bullets you shot while going back in time, you must also dodge enemy projectile and attacks. Controls are very solid and responsive and the soundtrack, while not incredible, is pretty enjoyable and fits well with the theme. I generally felt that any mistakes where my fault and not the game's, though X-Treme difficulty might make me change my mind (should drop down to Tough or Pro first, probably).The game diesn't completely render properly on a 2560x1080 resolution (UI hangs over white letterboxing) and the visuals are sometimes, but rarely so flashy that you may miss a beat on the track, but beyond that, I can't voice any other major complaints to this game.

There are a couple of additional mechanics added into the mix such as power-ups and power-downs and a double multiplier, but I would argue the most important ability is the one to reverse time, which allows you to reverts your mistakes and even takes you away from the game over screen, and facilitates clearing up the levels, however if you decide to use the ability there's a big chance you won't be getting a good score at the end of the song.The game appears to have little replay value when  it's played for the first time but  in reality it contains has 10 levels, 6 difficulties and scoreboards which should be enough to keep you entertained for at least 6 hours (Especially because the last difficulty is brutal).Not to say the game doesn't have any annoyances, oh no it does have some. For instance I find playing the harder difficulties almost impossible to play with a keyboard, so I recommend sticking to using a gamepad, lines also seem to have registration problems from time to time and there's this one boss battle that I believe to be impossible to being hit by unless you replay the level over and over again and learn its pattern (And I'm not apparently the only one considering there's a pretty useless hint if you die on that battle telling you how to supposedly predict being hit by it).I would also argue some levels are way harder than others, for instance I believe the boss of the fourth area and the second-to-last area are waaaaay harder than the last one.But alas, these are simple nit-picks and I'm overall happy with the game.I don't know if it's worth full price but if you're a rhythm game fan then this is a must buy on sale."

Somewhat like Audiosurf, you move your ship between 2 to 5 lanes and shoot to the beat, but you also have to dodge enemy attacks at the same time; planning a safe flight path while keeping the beat can be hectic. There's also a fair amount of content on offer for a game that can go for as low as $0.99 during sales: 10 stages with five difficulty levels and a challenge mode. The music itself is good; no track stood out as something I'd want to listen to outside of the game but as a whole it was pretty chill techno throughout. Last of all, the game's plot is actually quite amusing for one that is mostly conveyed through stage select description and the credits cutscenes.On the flipside, the timing of the beats feels ever-so-slightly off compared to other games in its genre, and some of the shot patterns like lane-swapping lasers and rapid missiles are not fun to deal with and don't really seem to match up with the music. Additionally, beat lines are turned off by default, despite the camera generally being angled in a 2.5-dimensional perspective that makes it difficult to gauge bullet distance compared to a typical 2-D shmup. In my experience, I couldn't play well without them on.Overall, I'd grade Retro/Grade a B-. I had fun with it but I wouldn't pay more than the dollar I did for it."

Wish the dev followed the game Beat Hazard, an wonderful game in this genre. Dont buy unless it is super cheap."

Otherwise I wouldn't recommend it."
