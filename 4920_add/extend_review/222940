Music is really nice, characters are fleshed out (No overpowered or underpowered crap except for the boss but thats to be expected for a SNK fighter), and a nice throwback to the older KoF games while maintaining modern graphics (Not 3D rendered graphics mind you). Customizable fighters is a plus although you don't do like in Soul Calibur or Tekken, you just change color palettes but I'm sure you'll come up with some good ideas.Overall, props to SNK for puttin this game to Steam. Heres hoping to see more of their titles here in the future."
76561198002465515,Recommended,222940,10374162,"Posted: 6 June, 2014",all,Redblaze27,"The King of Fighters has always been among the underdog fighting game series compared to its peers like Street Fighter and Mortal Kombat. Whether it be due to its stubbornness to stick on the Neo Geo arcade machine architecture until 2003, the usage of 24-bit graphic sprites until its twelfth numerical entry in the series, or the stronger anime influence on the series than the genre's most famous franchises, The King of Fighters is a series that is highly underrated and deserves much more praise than it gets.Whereas the series is notable for experimenting with new gameplay engine mechanics, The King of Fighters XIII opts to lift the most popular gameplay elements from the fan favorite entries, The King of Fighters '98 and The King of Fighter 2002, and marries them to the high quality sprite designs introduced with The King of Fighters XII, making for one of the greatest entries in the series. The game's 36 character roster hosts all the franchise staple characters and a good amount of fan favorites, which provide a large amount of variety in character playstyles to choose from so you are bound to find a character that will suit any style of player. The game also sports one the most robust amount of options seen in a 2-D fighting game ranging from an in-depth tutorial, arcade mode, story mode, challenge modes, online multiplayer, and even a custom character color editor for personalizing your favorite characters.What makes Steam Edition different from the console version of the game is that it includes the three DLC characters into the base package and sports the refined balancing from Japanese arcade only revision of the game ""The King of Fighters XIII Climax"". Also, while the netcode is vastly improved over its console counterpart, the features present for online multiplayer are the same. The game does not feature any sort of lobby system nor does it allow you to browse replays or spectate other players matches. These aren't really a deal breaker but the lack of them is a real shame.If you are looking for a game in the series for a good first impression or are just looking for one of the fighting game greats from the seventh console generation of games, you cannot do very much better than The King of Fighters XIII Steam Edition."
,Recommended,222940,10681595,"Posted: 22 June, 2014",all,sny,"The most balanced fighting game of this generation and - once you get the hang of the game mechanics - the most exhilarating one to play as well. Characters share a basic set of offensive and defensive moves that allow you to escape or overcome any situation at any time with the proper read, unlike other popular 2D fighting games where you're sometimes doomed to die in certain situations.The game also differs from most of its contemporary counterparts in that offense is almost always rewarded more generously than defense, discouraging turtling, full-screen keep-away and holding your ground. The fast pace and multitude of movement options also means that the emphasis on prediction is much higher than on reaction, and a general lack of inputs covering multiple options means that against similarly skilled opponents you can't rely on autopilot like you can in Capcom fighting games, making your every decision matter.It also helps to sell the experience that the animations and sounds of special and desperation moves are impactful and convey a sense of power like no other 2D fighting game. The soundtrack full of rock tunes also fits the game very well. Last but not least, the devs working on the Steam version of the game did an admirable job with the netcode compared to console versions, making this port the best choice for players without a local offline fighting game scene.If you look forward to being challenged by a game and you aren't intimidated by a steep learning curve, difficult controls and high risk, high reward gameplay, you can't go wrong with King of Fighters XIII."

PvP online matches never gets old. No matter how expert you are there will be always someone who is better than you. There are no limits for perfection. The more you play the more you learn..in comparison to other fighting game series such as STREET FIGHTER or DEAD OR ALIVE, KoF has lot more combos and moves. Besides simple PUNCH-KICK-JUMP each character has 5 to 8 different SPECIAL MOVES, in addition to 2 to 3 SUPER SPECIAL MOVES  which consumes 1 power gadge. and lastly there is a NEO MAX SPECIAL ATTACK which consumes 3 power gadge and can eat up half of your opponents health bar. There is also a ''combo canceling'' function Where you can make a combo chain one after another.And yes, the Online multiplayer is still alive. At the time of writing 700-1000 people are playing KoF XIII everyday. But don't just go there and spam the QUICK MATCH button, instead of searching for ready matches, it would be more helpfull if you create your won Lobby and wait for other players to join in, this way i always found someone in less than 5 minutes or so.1. First go to MAIN MENU > ONLINE > RANKED MATCH > CREATE MATCH > CREATE ROOM, and wait for 5 to 7 minutes.if nobody joins your Match....2.

If you've rumbled with friends and foes in the version that appeared on last-generation consoles, you'll feel right at home here: the intricate combat mechanics, gorgeous graphics, and uptempo music are successfully ported over to this Steam port. Even better, The King of Fighters XIII: Steam Edition contains all the console DLC, the King of Fighters XIII: Climax arcade features, and PC-centric graphics options. In short, The King of Fighters XIII: Steam Edition is an excellent title, but a few problems keep it from KO'ing the fighting game king, Ultra Street Fighter IV.The King of Fighters XIII: Steam Edition isn't for the faint of heart. Casual fighting game fans will enjoy executing basics and supers, but those who are willing to spend significant time in the digital dojo are the ones who will make the most of the game's complex combat system. That's true of all fighters, save for the incredibly basic Divekick, but in order to truly get good, you'll need to learn, and properly implement, cancels.Cancels—Drive Cancels, Hyperdrive Cancels, and Super Cancels—let you quickly exit a move and input another to unleash ungodly combos and big damage. These cancels are governed by each fighter's Hyperdrive Gauge, which fills as you land, block, and take hits. Depending on the cancel needed, you'll consume between 50 percent to 100 percent of the Hyperdrive Gauge—so cancel with prejudice.The King of Fighters XIII: Steam Edition has many defensive options that help you avoid or mitigate damage. Rolls let you quickly evade attacks. Short hops allow you to avoid footsie attacks without leaving yourself exposed to a possible anti-air attack. CD Blowback Attacks costs meter, but they let you quickly counter a move when you're in block stun. It's essential to master these excellent moves to get yourself out of sticky situations.The King of Fighters XIII: Steam Edition's graphics impress in a manner that few modern 2D fighting games can match, as it balances silky animation with a ruggedness that fits a fighting game. Guilty Gear's visuals are beautiful, but overly polished. Ultra Street Fighter IV's polygons are lovely, but lack soul. The King of Fighters XIII: Steam Edition, on the other hand, drips in colorful, expertly shaded pixel love. Its graphics may not match Street Fighter III: 3rd Strike's insane-to-the-point-of-distraction animation, but what's there is absolutely stunning.What isn't quite as attractive is The King of Fighters XIII: Steam Edition's netcode, which is decent at best. Lag appeared in many of my online matches, though in varying degrees. Sometimes the lag appeared for a second or so; at other times, it impacted my ability to beast an opponent. SNK Playmore's GGPO aversion baffles me.Check out my fully review:http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2395467,00.asp"

,Recommended,222940,31891454,Posted: 21 May,all,Rulio,"Started this game thinking KOFXIV will not be out on PC before the end 2017. I wanted to be aware about how we play at a true KOF to get myself prepared.Pros.► Clean graphics and overall effects. Game looks good and cutscenes look great (despite not havinf voices lel)► Musics are great since it's a SNK games, but I have to point some sound issues like the sound saturation on loud effect like some Neo Max Supers (Mai's for exemple)► Great story that conclude well the Ash Chapter of KOF.► Solo gamemodes which are quite numberous► AI Difficulty. Well, while KOFXIII is maybe my worst game (speaking of skill) I can say the difficulty is quite okay (usually playing VS on 4/5) BUT, my bois, difficulty can quickly skyrocket during some important phases like the Story mode, Bosses battles in Arcade mode which are ridiculous and Survival.► Roster. Since I love Chang, Yamazaki, Mai, Billy and King of Dinosaur, I've been disappointed by the roster. But I must admit this roster full of fanboys characters like Terry, Shen Woo, K', Athena or Kim can loved by absoluetly every KOF fan.► Color Edit is quite okay imo. I am used to mod every fighting game I got to give the perfect looks for my characters. This editor is quite complete but lacks a looks of options like some characters eyes or hair (Billy or Elizabeth.)Neutrals.► Gauges and Meter system. Since I discovered KOF with CapcomVSSNK2 and KOFXIV, I disregard this gauge system because I think it's way too hard to achieve the two full meters to strike good combos. Not mentioning this drive and HD cancels system which can ruin your momentum if you got poor execution in this game.► Overall balance. Not to mention those completely broken unplayable bosses, the balance is really ""Meh"". While some characters are overpowered god-tiers bobs like Kim, Mr Karate or Iori, the others are quite strong like Mai or Duo Lon but clearly don't match for god-tiers.► Some characters desgin are quite great in this game like Kyo while some like Billy's are unformostly trash (never liked his original blue work jeans suspenders or whatevs ;c ).► Some characters choices. > Remove Chang and Choi from Team Kim and but Raiden and Hwa which are even less appreciatedCons.► Execution-heavy and tiny combo window. Used to USFIV and DOA5LR, it was a pain in the bang to get used to it. KOFXIII is clearly not noob-friendly, so be prepared.► Keyboards compatibility. You can play with keyboards of course but you will struggle at first to configure it (note to remove every second player keyboard entries first) and then you will see that KOFXIII messed up some inputs for some motions. Like the HCBx2 for instance which requieres the down input 2 times which makes it impossible to quickly do this motion. Some other games like KOF98UM and KOF2002UM on Steam don't have this issue due to the fact the devs fixed it.► Way to much noob-friendly wannabe.TL;DR.This game is a pretty good 2D fighter but suffer from having the feel that only KOF veteran can enjoy it to the max due to its execution-heavy gameplay (that I assume it's okay since it's a KOF game) and keyboard compatibility.71/100"

However, for beginners, you have got a bit of a mountain to climb. This game is a sequel of sequels in the purest sense, in that it expects you to already have played a previous version of KOF. There is a tutorial, which does help, but you have to play and practise alot to get to grips with the true depth of this game. And the tutorial does a pretty lame job of introducing you to the very advanced fighting system. But that said, you can still enjoy it as a casual fighter.This game has some of the finest 2d graphics and animation, with cut-screens looking like anime. The character spries move flawlessly and look so much better than they ever did on the mighty NeoGeo (that does include Mai and her bouncing....errrm distractions). However, the graphics options are limited, as are the available resolutions.So to the game play. The fighting system, as I stated before is very advanced. And this has translated well into the Steam version (unusual as most Japanese ports from console/aracde to PC general suck noodles). It is recommended that you get a very good joystick or joypad to enable you to pull off the specials. Also, as this is a team battle, you need to gain skills for not just one character, but three as you are involved in 3x3 battles. This adds to the learning curve if you a noob.All-in-all, I wholeheartedly recommend this game. It's migration to the PC has been handled very well by SNK-Playmore. A welcome game on the PC that so sorely needs more fighting games. Buy it now!!!"

In fact, given how important timing is in 'KOF13', it's amazing how responsive the keyboard controls are when executing special moves.

I'd recommend it to fans of the franchise or players who have played other fighting games, but I wouldn't necessarily recommend it as a ""first fighting game"" and here's why.At time of posting, I'm 2 hours in KoF 13, have 93 hrs in Blazblue CSE, and a few hours in KoF 2002. (And also a bunch of other fighters and consoles stuff from ages ago.) Although these aren't a LOT of hours in KoF 13, it's still enough to see a buch of different modes and get a feel for things. I doubt my opinion will change too much later on, and I want to post these observations while they're fresh. Fwiw I will probably put a bunch more time into this game 'cause I like it, even though I like Blazblue better.Improvements over KoF 2002:-Color select menu with preview.-Any controller can play on either side in local mp.-720p sprites, much higher in resolution and they look better.-Better tutorials and movelist in 13. 2002 has a very very barebones tutorial.-Better Menus.-Probably a bunch of other improvements.Ways KoF 13 isn't as good as KoF 2002:-Less characters in KoF 13 than 2002.-Some background stages are more charming in KoF 2002 than 13. (13 stages look better overall)-Less charming character art imo in KoF 13 than 2002 in some ways. (13 looks better overall)-Some character design changes, maybe for worse.-Gameplay changes may annoy purists. *shrug*Ways Blazblue is better, especially for newcomers to the genre:-Blazblue has a better tutorial with explanations about why and how etc. Tutorial is much longer, and fully voice acted. KoF 13 tutorial is much shorter, no voice acting.-Blazblue is more elegant and easy to learn in terms of inputs and game systems.-Blazblue has more accessible combos and inputs.-Blazblue has easier to read movelist, better menus.-Blazblue has both english and japanese voice acting. KoF 13 only has Japanese (I think?) and only for in battles.-Blazblue has a much better written story, full voice acted, you can advance at your own pace. KoF has no story voice acting, story advances automatically without your input. This means story will either be too slow or fast.Neutral:-Sprites designed in 720p look like crap in not 720p.-Blazblue has a lot of SP content, KoF 13 appears to have a lot as well, although maybe less. (I hear SF5 is very poor in SP content.)-Both games have nice character designs and animations, although have different styles and looks.KoF 13 is the last KoF to use 2d art, which is another reason to get this, as later games will be somewhat different due to this.At $5 on sale, KoF 13 is hard not to recommend. However, you might have a better time purchasing latest Blazblue or Guilty Gear first, especially if you are new or inexperienced to the fighting genre."

In fact, its one of the hardest fighting game on steam (along with BlazBlue and Guilty Gear, however both them have in-depth tutorial while KOF XIII...has one, yeah but really lackluster).The mechanics are ""easy"" to learn but difficult to pull off. The trial mode, which consists of 10 missions for every character, is a good example of what I'm talking about. Timing is strict as hell, you stop (or jump too late, too early...) even for half-second and you drop the combo. Once you get the grasp of it...the fun is immense!After 210h+ poured into this game, I still consider myself a beginner, even if i completed two characters' trial (Vice and Maxima) [I think these two characters have the easiest trials compared to other characters...Leona/Ash being the hardest to complete).Story is nice but if you haven't played the previous chapters (KOF 2003 and KOF XI [KOF XII doesn't have a story]), it can be hard to fully understand the story.Arcade mode is the classic arcade mode we know and love.

In Tekken you can juggle(do some combos while your enemy is in mid-air) easily. It's easy to land attacks when you launch them into the air. However, this game doesn't work like that. At first I found the command list very small and limited. No 10 hit combos (like Tekken) but as soon as I explored the game a little more, there is a mode called ""Mission"" in the main menu. And in that mode, there is a sub-mode called ""Trial"" that, ladies and gentlemen, is where I learned how to combo.However, I want to warn you again that this game is high skill cap and some combos are very frustrating; you'll end up making your own.That's not a bad thing!It also took me a while to fully understand the game's mechanics like EX moves and such.It was fun :D I really love this game.The only con is that only a few play online(maybe in my region only).

You are expected to know all the names and backgrounds already.-Limited resolution setttings-Uneven difficulty progression.-Could really use a key rebind for menu pageup and pagedownThe game runs very smoothly on my J-series intel [2GHz] + 820M setup.  The tutorial mode is nowhere near the skullgirls level, but the practice mode is good [easy access to command list].   The Story mode is like a choose-your-own-adventure which is fun, but for someone who is new, I struggled to put a face to the speaker, often not knowing who                                                        was talking until the frame scanned to the other side at the end of the scene.  Also my major gripe is with the difficulty spike at the end.  I can clear out story mode with ease, often using only one character per fight, yet the final boss will get perfect matches against me.  Yes, it will make his defeat more rewarding, but it cheapens the rest of the fights.  I like Street Fighters progression more, where each fight is more difficult than the last, so that I can better gauge how well I am improving with a character.Aside form all that, the game is really fun.  The fighting is solid and the variety of approaches to the story mode give it some replay value for people like me who like to know character backgrounds.I have not tried online multiplayer mode, and wont until I have stable internet."

I find myself enjoying 'KOF13' quite a lot because it's easy to learn. At the same time, for fighting game connoisseurs, the game offers plenty of room for technical mastery given the huge character roster, impressive list of special moves, and intricate implementation of gauge and move cancelling systems.More importantly, for a game ported to the PC, 'KOF13' plays really well with a keyboard, so there is really no need to get a console controller before trying it out. In fact, given how important timing is in 'KOF13', it's amazing how responsive the keyboard controls are when executing special moves.

,Recommended,222940,9137702,"Posted: 16 February, 2014",all,Assbad,"There are two things I have to point out before being able to recommend KoF XIII fully.The first one being technical issues: this game has issues with VSync, lack thereof, and everything surrounding game-speed. You will have to spend some time trying to set up your game so that it doesn't run too fast or too slow, but that's just a matter of combining forced VSync through your GPU's settings and fiddling with the ingame-options (fixed framerate); make sure to add ""-r"" (without quotes) to the launch-options for the game in Steam.The second thing to point out is that this game is pretty difficult to play. If you wanted to compare KoF to Street Fighter, you'd probably have to say that where Street Fighter has tight links on buttons (plinking 1frame-links) but relatively simple motions, KoF has demanding motions (qcbhcfb and similar) but lenient input-windows for buttons. KoF also has 4 different types of jumps (hop, hyper-hop, jump, super-jump) and a huge roster of characters. All that said,here's a good YouTube-tutorial(general non-KOFXIII-specific KoF-tutorial).As for the good things, the game being fairly difficult to get into means it's also very rewarding. Momentum plays a huge role, so the neutral game and knowing how to apply/escape pressure are very important. The netcode seems pretty good, from my experience thus far it's very close to playing offline with a good connection. The characters allow for a fairly varied approach to the game and building interesting teams (3 characters/team that fight 1v1 until you or your opponent run out of characters). Game-balance overall is generally considered pretty good; there are no complete duds on the roster, only some chars need to work harder to win. The training-mode offers most of the functionality you'd expect- could be better. The trials are meant to showcase shortcuts and be a challenge to experienced KOF players, if you try to learn the game by playing them (which can be done, theoretically), you're going to have a very bad time.To get started I'd recommend watching the tutorial linked above, look up the bread-and-butter combos for the characters of your choice/interest on theShoryuken.comKoF-wikior theDreamcancel KoF-wikior similar sites, and to maybe just jump right in and play with a fellow noob, that's always very helpful- online you'd probably get destroyed, from what I read on different forums.A very solid 2D fighter that is well worth investing into."

I'm not saying its the funniest, the most important, the one with best graphics, no. Then why do i say it's the ultimate? It's all about the gameplay. If you've ever played any KOF before, you know it's not a friendly game. But if you know how to play it, know the basic combos and the special moves, you can kick♥♥♥♥♥at any other game, for sure. When i get in the arcades and play SF (any version) i kick massive loads of butt, excepting when the pros come. Guilty gear? piece of cake. UMVC? are you kidding? heck, even in blazblue i've kicked♥♥♥♥♥with my first coin, and i barely know that game. I've just bought Skullgirls and i kick some♥♥♥♥♥there too, but not as much as the other games. So think, it's a game that's been refined for 13 times, its fast, has great combos, some of the best 2d art (the best in my opinion) and tunes you up for every other game. Even tekken lol.

I didnt blame him as when i finally played it , I felt hat I was playing a demo. That game was not KOF quality .Well I am happy to say 13 or XIII was the charm that brought sense back to the KOF world.  THe gamepplay and graphics were awsome. Loved the music as well. BUt what I really enjoyed about this game, was the story aspect of this gaming series. This series concentrated on character story first. In story. This adds depth to the game. To see Terry and KYO talk about KOF attendance was great. TO see how the womens team felt towards the Fatal Fury or Art of fighting team is priceless.  If you been playing this series since 94 or even just discovered t, you will see that certain toons actually ahve association with each other.  The fact that SNKPLAYMORE included it in the game was awsome.Will you like this game is the real question. If your a fighting game fan or even a KOF fan Im gonna say yes. A HELL YES to the KOF fan part. Warning, unlike Capcom bosses, these SN Bosses want you  to know the game inside our before challenging them. There is a reason the term SNk Boss Syndrome existed.

Sadly Kof 13 is one of those KoFs, no Duck King and the roster feels minimized. However, this is probably the best thing SNK has done in ages. The PC port is just beautiful, it lacks the high def res and animation of Blaz Blue, but it's still a really beautiful game and the resolution goes up to 1980 x 1080 although it defaulted to my TV's standard 720p 1340 res switching was easy. There's a customization mode so you can just palette swap sprites so when you go to battle, your team is customized to your liking, missions ad variety and even in arcade mode the game politely asks you to perform certian accomplishments. The game ran flawlessly on my pc, I was really impressed. Getting online and playing in this is easier than in Street Fighter IV. Oh yeah AND IT'S A KOF GAME!! Are there a few transgender lesbians around? OF COURSE! And one has super stretchy arms too! King still kicks my♥♥♥♥♥every time. Super powered school girl? Check. Oh yeah and the game also has story... and I mean like a lot of story. Every single character has a smack down talk before the battle and cut scenes even delve to a plot that's slightly intriguing.

Probably the best netplay I've seen from a fighting game on PC next to Skullgirls. It's also a hell of a lot better than the netplay on the console versions of the game.SNKP really put some effort into porting the game over, and they really listened to the community during the beta period and even after release for a good while. If there was an issue, chances are, it was fixed the next day. I can't think of any issues that still remain.The sprites and backgrounds are beautiful, and are refreshing to see in a time where all the big budget fighting games have shifted to 3D models and animation. The gameplay is excellent. It's fast and fluid, but it takes skill and dedication to master it.

Mixing the best elements from past games makes this a must have for any fighting game fan. They included almost all the classic characters and added new ones to increase the roster. Each character was giving proper love in the form they had most of their moves and supers (with variations depending on cancels, drives and super meters). The 2D sprites are the same ones from XII but that's a good thing. KOF was meant to look 2D and these graphics give the game it's soul and personality (unlike the weird looking KOF XIV). The alternate versions of Kyo, Iori and Mr. Karate (Takuma) are included in the Steam version which is great since you had to pay for them in the PS3 version.All in all I loved the KOF games since '98. It kept using dated sprites for the longest time but the gameplay was still there. They tried 3D and that didn't work. They introduced new graphics in KOF XII but rushed its production which made the game lackluster. THIS is the version to have since it has everything you could want (well, except proper online play). I would be lying if I said the online functionality was there. The community is pretty dead. So its very difficult to find an opponent online. Even if you do the netcode could use a lot of work.

There are some networking issues for when you finally do find a match. No way to view input.WORTH:Unless youknowyou want this game, I would not suggest it to everyone. It has very weak sales, there are newer, more popular installments out, and you will be going in blind while learning inputs. Very frustrating!OVERALL:It has some gameplay and multiplayer flaws that may hold you back from having fun with it. Still, I find it to be an enjoyable installment despite its problems. It's got a great cast and is really satisfying once you find your rhythm.SCORE:7/10Full Review Coming Soon"

With a massive roster of playable characters and high graphical fidelity, this 2D fighter is not to be missed.   Some interesting issues I feel the need to point out for those already familiar with the KOF franchise though:  In KOF13 Classic Flame Iori, Mr. Karate, and Ex Kyo are not available for Random in Online VS - Though still pickable; and it IS possible to random them as well as the unlockables (Ash/Billy/etc) in Local VS.  Lack of support for multiple players in a lobby (limited to 2 players max  losers walk?) is a minor inconvenience as well as stability being tied to Steam Friends Network(also not ideal).  That said, when the connection IS solid the response time to inputs is virtually indistinguishable from local play.  Highly reccomend 8/10"

Now, just to let you know, at the time of making this review (9-2-2016) I did not yet play the story mode. Now, about the game: it has a good selection of characters and lets you make a team of 3, pick 3 characters, learn some combos, and have fun! The controls are great and it has great combos! There are a lot of good to say, but there are 3 flaws, 1:The backgrounds look really weird (especially compared to the rest of the game) 2:The drive cancels (done by inserting a special command while doing another special move) is really picky on the timing. And finally, number 3:This game suffers from SNK boss syndrome! If you don't know what that is, it's basically what SNK does all the time by making the final boss unnecessarily hard, even on THE EASIEST DIFFICULTY, but if you can get past those flaws, by all means, buy it!

Six hours later, my new one's analog stick's becoming loose.Painfully truthful jokes aside, this is an excellent game and worth the disposible controllers. Cast is extensive and, for the most part, each unique in their own way.Controls are incredibly smooth and responsive (I'm just too rough apparently), and its fairly easy to pick up and play (i.e: button mash) but the combat and combos are really worth learning; you'll WANT to spend hours and hours in training mode to improve your skills (I'm still trying to successfully pull off a 40 hit combo with Leona I saw in some video). Is it necessary? Probably not, but it's a lot of fun to experiment and then brag to your friend who doesn't give a rat's bum about it before he goes back to talking about catgirls or whatever; I don't bother paying attention; after that 20 hit combo, I'll fight his catgirl 1v1.The graphics are beautiful and stylish; the character sprites are well detailed, the animation is great, special effects are flashy, and the backgrounds are pretty; some of the backgrounds have people watching you fight, and I swear they're on something because they move faster than a McLaren F1 with the rev limiter removed being driven by Michael Schumacher while hearing the Emerald Hill Zone music from Sonic 2 in the background.  It's hilarious.I will lastly add that I speak for single-player and local-multiplayer only. I haven't the slightest clue how well online play is.All in all, this is one of the best damn fighting games I've ever played and worth a purchase even at full price.

O que acontece então na TV 32"" com resolução 1080p é que o cenário fica bem feito e os personagens ficam ULTRA MEGA serrilhado deixando o jogo realmente triste.Então recomendo para aqueles que comprarem e tiverem TV de 32"" ou mais jogarem no modo janela mesmo para serem felizes desde o início.Nota: 7.5/10.0Minha review antiga e bem negativa...=pp""Uma♥♥♥♥♥♥♥foda, ainda bem que comprei essa porcaria baratinho.O gráfico é uma porcaria.Nem a metade de personagens do que um dia já foi King of Fighters.Lamentável.Não comprem a não ser que sejam entusiastas e queiram ter esse jogo só por ter mesmo."""

I can only reccomend this game to you if have friend(s) that have good connections that live close to you that you can play with, then maybe this version might be worth it.

Actually? They're lazy to re-draw everything).  The animations don't have as much frames as they should for a 2d fighter of 2013 (Check out Skullgirls to see the difference and the like).  The gameplay feels very stiff...but worst of all for me, the jumping in this game is nuts.  KOF games have a lot of jumping involved...this one takes the cake.King of Jumpers XIII - Air-Attacks Edition, ftw.The netcode in this game is more stable and reliable then: MK: Komplete Edition, Injustice: Gods Among Us, Street Fighter X Tekken, Ultra Street Fighter; However, there aren't many ppl playing.  Not nearly as many encounters as Ultra Street Fighter (SSF4:AE) but more encounters then Street Fighter X Tekken (SFXT).  On par, about as many encounters as MK: Komplete Edition and Injustice, which isn't a big deal at all.  Most of the time, you'll find people from half-way across the world and have wonderful bad delay together and the game pausing while it displays a  [Synchronizing...] menu in your face.Character designs are hit and miss.  Some are totaly rediculous:- The Ikari male soldiers are blatantly on mass amounts of illegal steroids.- Billy Kane looks like a heroin addict in remission.- Joe Higashi may be Japanese, but he's suffered some weight loss fighting for his freedom in a Thai prison.- King is just straight up anorexic now.- ALL of the females are actually aging backwards, each KOF game.  Yuri, especially, is suffering from a Curious Case of Benjamin Button.Get RomStation.fr or Mame32K++ (or any kaillera-supported emulator) or even GGPO and emulate the earlier KOF games, for free, with (ironically) better netcode rather then buy this one on steam.  With Mame32K you can play 3 players 3 players, online...Hell you can even have 10 ppl in , 6 playing, 4 spectating or you can have a 3 player co-op or a 3 player co-op vs 1 player + 2 AIs...so much fun options.Nothing like that here.  Nothing as intuitive.  Nope.  Emulated versions of KOF raised the bar for online play for me and the earlier KOF games (which I love to bits) to the point where this one falls just bellow average."

Game. <Kanye> OF ALL TIME </Kanye>On a more serious note, even though I've spent more time on other fighting games, KoF 13 is my favorite.I think people shy away from KoF because it has a reputation for being difficult and hard to get into, but I think this is bunk. I'd say that for the fighting games of its generation, KoF 13 probably has the strongest emphasis on fundamentals. Here are a couple of reasons why :-Although 4 types of jumps make it sound complicated, it actually allows jump-ins;-Zoning with projectile attacks is less practical because of the 4 jumps and roll;-Match-up issues are moot because of the 3v3 system;-There are no complicated setups to learn like in GG with Bedman or Venom;-I've never been dragon punched in the middle of a dropped combo.Sure, I suck at Hyper Drive Cancels, and I can't remember what the names of moves like 101 Shiki Oboroguruma, but I rarely feel cheated out of a win.Also, it's one of the best looking 2D games ever, and it has some of the best fighting game music around."

It's almost impossible to do any special moves not only on keyboard, but on gamepad too.3)Lots of boring characters. The game has about 35 characters, but I can't call any of them unusual or interesting.4)Music and graphics. They are not bad, but definitely can't be a reason to buy this game.As result, I can only suggest that most of positive recommendations come from people, who played in previous parts of this game and satisfied with this one, but as a new player in KoF I am heavily dissapointed with this game.

They always use moves that freeze you solid and cannot be blocked, meaning you never get any chance to move, unless you can find a flaw in AI and keep using one move that the AI doesn't care to block.Problem number two, the difficulty setting doesn't seem to affect versus mode. Even at highest difficulty, the CPU opponent in versus mode is still too easy.Problem number three, online match sucks. I don't play well and lose most of the time, but won't it be better if the balance can be adjusted according to the players' stats. This system is there in versus mode, so why not online match mode? Because I always lose, I've lost all interest in online matches.With the three problems, I don't want to play arcade mode because the boss is too hard and I can't finish the game; I don't want to play versus mode because CPU is too easy; and I don't want to play online match mode because I always lose. There's no point in playing anymore. Well there are still trials I can challenge, but that's about all.+ it's KoF at its best(?)+ combos, combos and combos+ story mode and collectibles+ free DLC- awful online battle- unfair boss battles6 out of 10, barely satisfying."

Mostly this is due to highly technical, fast, rewarding and simply enjoyable gameplay coupled with the stunning visuals and soundtrack. You can tell that many hours were spent crafting the sprites, backgrounds and gently tweaking the hitboxes and movestes of the characters. Almost every move in every character's moveset has a use, which is testament to trimming of superfluous waste in this truly streamlined fighter. Effort was put into developing the game and it shows; most evidently in the highly balanced character roster in my opinion. Like all figting games the learning curve is steep, but because of the very technical nature of King of Fighters the execution barrier is even higher. Regardless even if one is new to the genre I can recommend it due to the extremely balanced characters, advanced mechanics and a well executed pace. As such there is a lot less frustrating nonsense that plagues many other fighters."

,Recommended,222940,10830689,"Posted: 26 June, 2014",all,Miawoo,"KOF XIII is NOT for the faint of heart. It is an extremly technical fighter. There is a metric ton of mechanics that may not seem important at first but end up being invaluable.  The Drive system, Gaurd Rolls, Short Hops, Neo MAX specials, blowbacks the list goes on. While it is very technical, it feels very rewarding to play at a higher level. Asides from the learning curve the other downside is online Ranked/Player matches. While the game itself runs very well online in my experience, there's a huge lack of actual players online. You better have some friends that'll pick it up with you. There just isn't a lot of people to fight without them. If you search outside your region, you're probably going to hit with some rubberbanding, frame rate drop, and lag. The people you do bump into however, are usually die hards. Be very prepared for a butt kicking your first time.If you're a fan of Street Fighter or fighting games in general and looking to explore the genre deeply, KOF XIII might be right up your alley. If you put the time into learning the game, you'll get a lot more out of it. It's very rewarding and online with friends usually plays pretty well.

It fixed many of the problems that XII had, and added a lot more. A revamped combat system, more characters, a better netcode.......this is definitely the full package.If you've been curious about this franchise for a long time, this is definitely a good game to start with.

The matches I've had online have been a lot of fun, and there are some very good players out there!The story mode is not the same or as good as the one found in Arc Sys' BlazBlue series, sadly. Its not as good as the most recent Mortal Kombat's, either. Its more of a visual novel with fighting periodically. Interesting, but not as fun as the others. Still, better than a straight arcade mode in that regard.If you like 2d fighting games, I can't recommend this game enough. You absolutely WILL NEED a control pad or joystick, though.

Every game brings a bit of a change up to the table, but collectively there's legs of the journey. One that's often come with an interesting story that waves just a bit sharper than most fighting game tittles of such background. Capcom still can't keep a major story of how Chun Li's father died. And to think SNK use to make this KOF collection of fighters from several of their games once every year.With the Orochi Saga leg, Nests Saga, and whatever you might call the last stretch of games through KOF 11 where they stoped giving them numbers on years and just sequal numbers, I'm not sure if we're in a SAGA, or just progressing a story that through the tournament that Rugal's children now sponsor, seemingly not being evil, another faction that seems very evil is using it toward their ends in plots that could undo Mankind as we know it. And like Jedah from the ye old DarkStalkers franchise, they seem to be a kind of re occuring evil that can go back and try again until something in a timeline changes.And the way they do this when all is said in done is smart as they find the best way to deal with a character many don't like that let's them finally leave the franchise, and yet also earns the character perhaps a bit more respect. Leave it to SNK to actually make a story that does some justice, and delivers a damn fine engine worthy of the tradition. It's not without a few flaws, but some of the likes come with tittles that look to recreate what they've been doing a bit.The Cons:The move lists are not to the hgiher counts like later in the Saga legs tittles like 98 or 2003 tended to bring, but much of the core moves known to characters are there and many with slight changes on their approaches to how they function.@#$$ I still miss Terry Bogard's ""Power Dunk"" move. I really #$%^ing do.The Music is decent, but not sure I'd call it the great music styles that SNK got into back in it's earlier years that made you feel the character and situation all the further. It just lacks some of that catchy factor, but it's fitting.If you're new to the franchise, it tells a story you can hop on right now and find some interest, but the real treat is in for people who do a little back searching into the rich story universe of SNK and how it's connected. Trust me the SNK universe is worth it, which is kind of a PRO if you're willing to do a little research.BAD AND GOOD.And finally I'm not sure I dig how the super bar is basically turned into two seperate bars. One is stockable and needed for your super specials, but to pull a NeoMax move, you need the top bar full too, or use that top power bar above the oragne to go into a powered up mode to so the neomax. But if you do you can in theory peform not only a special into a super special, but a Super Special into your NeoMax move. The things you can pull become a massive game changer.When you pull some heavy hititng stuff in SNK, you know it, and you feel it. Sometimes on the recieving end you feel it a bit much, but otherwise it feels rewarding and creats it's sense of danger. But the multi bars turn it into feeling a bit more cumbersom in requirements than at first most may like.THE VERY GOODSMai is back. Anyone who follows SNK will know what I'm talking about. No Mai no buy as they say.The flash and flare is there and feels like it bellongs but makes for some good wow moments. In fact the all over 2D fighter package looks good and yet not disorienting.Controls are good, yet not over the top forgiving. You get what you pull, and when you figure out what you're doing wrong and get it right, you're going to know it and do plenty better as a reward for doing it right, and it will stick with you if you play semi regularly.Classic Yuri and King clothing malfunctions after special moves are back. Ask a veteran, or beat Yuri or King with a special move and up and you'll understand what I mean. Yes, it's necessairy.Combos can be impressive, but you work for them, and chances are with the team three on three broken up matches they give you good oppertunity to turn things around, and the combos aren't super over the top to the level you should just put your controller down and die like Marvel vs Capcom 3.Play Iori in both his forms without extra DLC cost.A certain someone not only dies, they utterly get undone from the universe, and most of you will applaud how it's done.The game simply looks as nice as it feels for someone to play, and you can get things done as a newer player or a veteran. With the way the team system works too, you really can pass the controller with a friend if you choose to team up and face the world online or the computer, or even local friends. Sometimes it dosn't need to be a tag match for it to be a good team endeavor.Unlock colors by simply playing the game to customize the character palates for quite the different looks. Maybe even put yourself in the shoes of one of the many SNK characters you really relate too. There's characters for every kind of fighting fan, make a few your own.WRAP UPIt's a solid game, plenty worth it's 20 dollar price tag these days, and if you'd really like to see how KOF has evolved, the tripple pack here on STEAM basically gives you the total up game play of some of the past high points of the KOF franchise. If you watch a play through of the other years to get some story, then play the wrap up leg tittle for yourself, like playing 98 witch has the best of everything non story wise from 94 to 97, or watch what happens up till the next year available on STEAM and then play that one, it can be a rather rewarding experience. Or hell, hunt down the other tittles and play them if you can. But seriously, at least peek out the story universe of the other tittles and play the leg wrap up tittles so you can feel the story as you come to understand it, even the once hidden characters that were a part of the story unfolding.With the STEAM tripple pack, you get those wrap up milestones of the series in a good final form, each one a bit different. Who knows, it may inspire you to look back into the depths of SNK and how the connections run deep, and get a piece of the fighting tradition that now and again in ways rivaled Capcom, a company that was very thrilled and supportive of it's fans.PS: Beware those who hold liniage with the Orochi blood. Baddie characters and characters with just cause alike. Beware the Blood Riot. All part of a story universe you'll learn to respect."
,Recommended,222940,16560935,"Posted: 20 June, 2015",all,Trizo,"Before playing this KOF game the only other somewhat related game that I played was Capcom Vs. SNK 2 EO on Gamecube. And that game, in my opinion, was the most amazing fighter that I had played to date besides Marvel Vs. Capcom 2. KOF XIII is slightly more complex than Capcom Vs. SNK 2 EO and possibly more balanced. It has many unique and colorful arenas to fight in plus a fitting soundtrack. The game runs extremely smoothely for me offline as well as online. This is a really solid and fun fighter with multiple game modes including a tutorial and fully customizeable character colors. The story mode in my opinion is the weakest part of the game, yet it isn't terrible, just different and may be confusing for people new to the series. KOF XIII has both keyboard and controller support. If you're a fan of Street Fighter or either of the other games that I've mentioned and you're in the mood for a fighter with online play that works then you should absolutely buy this."
,Recommended,222940,17225324,"Posted: 25 July, 2015",all,rogueyoshi,"This game's feel is closer to a Capcom game for me than any other KoF, and as such you can expect the kind of fluidness you see in a game like CVS2, if not more thanks to it's generally freer movement options. There's a big roster of dangerous characters, despite what you might see at major events. One gripe that OGs might have (or may not) is that the game demands some tight execution on some combos for certain characters to make them viable, but as a tradeoff you can expect to capitalize on damage in situations when you make reads where you would not be able to get much otherwise. And the netplay is decent, but don't expect coast to coast matches with it.For the non-competitive out there, there's your usual arcade, survival, trial and story modes (which is basically a Visual Novel here). As well as a color edit (which works online) and unlockable titles/emblems.Easy buy if you're even remotely interested in dabbling with the series. Very easy buy if you want something competitively sound, if not a little overlooked for easier stuff."

Presentation wise it is absolutely gorgeous. Vibrant colors, awesome characters, fluid animation, KOFXIII has this in spades.The combat system is unlike any other fighting game I've experienced. With 3 basic ways to avoid attacks from your opponent(block, roll, blow back) you will experience very unique situations where the tide of battle can change at any moment. Though many say this is an execution heavy game, I feel it's a lot more forgiving then Street Fighter IV especially when linking normals into super moves. This gives the game a very gradual feel and rewards the player who takes the time to learn the more advanced techniques like HD combos.While the verdict is still out on the internet connectivity, I've had a chance to play the beta and must say as a player coming from the xbox 360 version, the steam version definitely shows a vast improvement. I played a few matches with someone in Boston(I reside in Georgia) and they were smooth. I also felt like the input was very responsive which is something that was a big issue with the KOF netcode on console ver.If you enjoy fighting games and have never experienced King of Fighters before I implore you to try XIII.

King of Fighters is not like the other current gen fighters where they hold your hand at every oppurtunity, all your wins come from your skill, and pretty much nothing else. All that being said, it can be quite a difficult fighter for people who are just starting out, but if you do start out with KoF you'll be much better off than had you started with Street Fighter IV or Marvel 3."

Using a controller or proper arcade stick is practically needed to play this even competently.KoF13 is one of the best fighters around right now, and is incredibly balanced. The technicality and risk of every character matches their reward amazingly, and you don't feel too underpowered playing anyone. The controls are tight and it feels amazing hitting your opponent with fully planned out combos. The customisation allows you to set colour palletes for any character, with new options added as you complete certain tasks with said character. Though the customisation is nothing compared to games like Soul Calibur, full control over the pallette with many colour options can give you a lot of cool possibilities.Pros: Controls are great, characters are balanced, line-up is large and extensive, the art is good.Cons: Considering the rewards for mastering the higher skill fighters, new players or people who aren't very good at fighters may be beaten down easily, since just cheesing it is hard in this game.

I'm useless at Fighting games but I love them all the same for the catharsis of mashing my controller after a long day at work but KoF XIII, even for a complete casual like me, is fantastically accessible but still has a deep core system. The arcade mode's standrad difficulty isn't as hard as the other KoF games on steam either. I can't comment on the competitive side of things becausl like I say, I'm just a casual fan, but if you've ever wanted to get into fighting games this is the one to start with in my view - an excellent cast of characters, simple to learn mechanics that will reward you the more effort you put in and some of the best graphics in any 2D fighter. It also avoids a pet peeve of mine with newer fighting games in that it doesn't have many (with the exception of a couple of Neo Max supers) overly long special moves with absurd animations - the flow is contsant and smooth throughout. The only downside if having to grind for colours for the character editor which can get tedious and it has the commin fighting game problem of not having enough music so I have to mute it to avoid oversaturating myself.

Any KoF you pick up characters play about the same with small changes each volume.This game however requires a lot of dedication, inputs need to be clean and on time. Doing something too fast will not be rewarded, I recommend actually seeing how SLOW you can achieve a link. Also learn buffering, you can input the motions for an attack while performing linked normals or special moves. Great for achieving desperation moves in your combos. (Example: Kyo has a desperation move that is quartercircle back half circle forward, in one of his lengthy combos you end up doing a reverse dragonpunch+lk. Instead of quartercircling back again... you can just half circle forward from the reverse dragonpunch.. the desperation move will come out)Be sure to check out this site for more basic and advanced information on the game, and each pages of information dedicated to each specific character.http://dreamcancel.com/wiki/index.php?title=The_King_of_Fighters_XIII"

Unlike those games which have mechanics specifically engineered to rewarding losing players with easy comeback chances (Ultras in SF4, X-Factor in MvC3), KOF XIII has none of that. Instead, what it offers is an incredibly solid, fast-paced, balanced and honest fighting game where victories are always earned, and the better player is always the one who wins.However, it should also be noted that the game is significantly less beginner friendly that any other fighting game on the market, with no easy inputs and strict timing requirements for combos. Additionally, the game only teaches the basics on the guages and on universal moves, but very little on HD and how to use it for combos. Unfortunately, you'll have to experiment in the training mode or search online to learn how to use each character. There is a character trial mode included, but the difficulty ramps up extremely quickly.The last thing worth mentioning is the online play which, when playing in Australia at least, is largely hit-or-miss. Of the online matches I've played since its release, roughly 90% have been noticably laggy or worse, with matches typically feeling like you're playing underwater, and at its worst dropping completely. However on the rare 3-4 bar connections, the lag wasn't an issue at all. Your mileage will vary."

I was certainly very eager to get this newer version of the game since the franchise did make quite a reputation back in the days some of which can still be caught here and there within the flock of oldschool / hardcore gamers nowadays. I've ended up waiting for a few months until a decent discount would more than justify the aquisition and o boy do i feel contented now!!The games basicaly works like it always has with all the evade - block - counter - Ex (?! well yeah that one is quite new to the KoF mechanics actualy!) - Fury - Deadly Fury and even the different jump manoeuvres such as big leap, tiny hops and even long/faster hops! The greatest asset of this game is to bring flashy and cartoon-like 2D graphics (set in motion by some of the best animation and framerate you'll ever get to see in one of thes fighter games!) with combat mechanics even a Tekken or Virtua Fighter wouldn't quite be able to compare to somehow! I know this quote seems to get a little more messy line after line so to sum up things and get to the point : Great visuals (if you can afford oldschool 2D themed games that is .. if you can't shame on you!), super complex yet accessible combat mechanics, quite a big rooster of fighters (even for a game like this one), quite amazing soundtrack and voiceacting (which tended to be somehow poorer in some earlier versions of the game) and as always a VERY challenging (if not too much at times!) AI .. If you like 2D fighters you will have to seriously consider putting your money into this one .. pretty much well spent!"

Well I guess pro's and con's then on to the story:Positives- Your King of Fighters fix on the PC- Nice soundtrack- Nice sprite animations, but then all oldskool MVS games had this in the 90's...Negatives- Milky character sprites, they somehow managed to get mily looking washed out colours for the main characters with blurry lines, now I know the originals used scan lines, but the sprites look bad compared to even really old Neo titles- Some of the re-worked characters look bad, I mean seriously bad compared to their original characters - they are a long way off what they originally were- The sounds are ok, but many of them are no where near as good as the earlier versions- The effects are terrible, the smoke, fire and explosions look like they are from a very badly made flash browser game- Story is very badly illustrated and told, even for a fighting game- Final bosses look just ridiculous, one of red guy with awful black smog coming off of him and just black splodges being thrown everywhere- Another is Ash, but again, with some real budget nasty grey bubble over him and just echos added to the sound, the stage is equally as terrible, just a white screen, I guess they ran out of ideas or something...I am a fan of the original king of fighters installments, I had the original Neo Geo cartridge system in the mid 90's and started off with Nam, World Heroes, then Art of Fighting 1+2, Fatul Fury and additional installments of world hereos and samurai showdown. King of fighters was a good game when it first came out, and several installments on the platform saw more characters, levels and overall content. Now, King of Fighters 95 did cost me £250 all those years ago, but, the hours me and my friends put in were worth every penny. To be honest, there have been so many rehashes of king of fighters over the years on the original machine, CD and handheld as well as other platforms, and to be honest I think it has lost it's way.I bought this expecing it to be a modern remake with enhancements, and with all of the positive reviews hoping it to be faithful to the original with fantastic sprites and sounds with upscaled visuals, whilst they tried they unfortunately fell short by quite a bit. I have no idea what game others are looking at that are saying it looks beautiful, I bought the game based on some of those reviews and I can only assume they have never played another 2D neo game before. The fonts and some of the stages / backgrounds look nice and detailed, but the main part - the characters look very washed out compared to it all, almost like you are playing at half the native resolution of your screen, and have a monitor with colour issues.I've not played it much at all, I just thought I would go back to it to see if I could get back into it but honestly I just can't stand the blurry, milky characters, terrible bosses and other things.You are better off just grabbing a neo emulator and playing the originals if you miss them, or perhaps getting one of those X's off of ebay, since most of the original consoles have all died by now. I've still yet to see anything that touches the original platforms titles, so I guess I am off hunting on ebay...Sadly, dissapointed."

The sprites are quite nicely detailed as well. I have a few gripes mostly related to how I have to actually git gud to beat the bosses without a continue service or standing in a corner and crouching-heavy-kicking them till the clock runs down... yeah... but my main gripe is that they made my waifu a charge character and I'm too lazy to commit to making a charge character work, probably."

,Recommended,222940,30189082,Posted: 25 February,all,Andre,My step dad got me into this series. I started off here on steam with KOF 2002 UM and boy was it hard at first. I was used to Guilty Gear insane combos and juggling so the transition to straight skill was immense. But after i got used to it now i am amazing. Fast forward a month or 2 and were here. This game has the most fluid and easy to pick up hard to master gameplay in any fighting game. I love it.Pros: EverythingCons:Almost no one online
,Recommended,222940,30212566,Posted: 26 February,all,Dragun,"Easily the best KOF game - so refined, smooth and slick!KOF2002UM would be the best NeoGeo era release and KOF14 would be the best non-sprite based release; I hope we get 14 on Steam one day.While Ultra Street Fighter 4 is most likely going to be the benchmark of fighting games and Super Street Fighter 2 will be the nostalgic benchmark; this is a game that all 2d fighting game lovers should have!Now I just need the Soul Calibur seried to get a Steam release and all will be right in the world lol!"

Start with some of the older, classic titles. Or if you prefer the newer stuff, jump to XIV, which starts a new story arc and features 2.5D graphics like Street Fighter IV and V."

Very solid fighting value, and would definitely recommend. If you wonder that which version should i buy (XIII or XIV), I suggest that if you are a experienced kof player or you prefer 2D design, buy XIII, and if you are quite new to this series or prefer 3D models, XIV is indeed the best choice."

I am not the best when it comes to fighting games but I used to play the arcade version alot and this really hit the spot in the nostalgia metter. I think it was worth the money and I am not a hard core fighting gammer just enjoy trying to win even in the online play.So far I haven't experienced any lag yet but am going to play it a few times just to be sure but so far I can safely say this game is great for any king of fighters fans.
