Otherwise I quite like this game, though I dislike they apparently made updated Melee to be weaker at some point, which seems unnecessary (especially since HP for Zombies weren't compensated it looks like).Thank you for those who found this ""helpful"" vague, unhelpful as it is, but I'm glad some people found it funny! It's a simple game that does its job well, and the desired experience of a zombie apolcaypse seems to be fully represented in all its mechanics.Anyway, its worth the $3.EDIT to the Steam Committee who wants to know this:It Fulfills the ""Test of Time"", as its simple nature allows for replayability, with it always a challenge on ""Hardest"", Achievements for some that tempt you to do things a little differently in a given run, as well as it's a decent casual game to play with a friend for Couch-Co-Op. So long as it exists, it won't really stop being fun, and can always go back to play again."

You go street to street while not trying to get eaten by the hoards of the undead. You can go into buildings and loot whatever you need to live and you also a pretty wide selection of guns to choose from as well. But besides the story mode you have a second campaign you can play as well as a last stand game mode.

,Recommended,222980,32833254,Posted: 26 June,all,Butterytumsfly,"its fun if you like the way it plays out. every zombie you come across was not meant to be killed. as the ammo count shows. the decisions you make with your ammo and your upgrades are a major game changer. With little ammo you have to find ways to let that ammo help you get to the next store. for the first few streets you could easily just walk through, though this is a good thing as it lets you stock up and sell the loot for more money and prepare for the real issues like the faster zombies which chip away at your health and the hordes that spawn when the rats run past. the extremely fast zombie is one that may seem impossible to beat but remember its not about beating the zombies its about surviving. so its best to just throw down a firework and run as fast as possible to the next road when he spawns, so save your fireworks.Though i really enjoy this game, i will try to point out some bad parts i thought of it. Its a little repetitive especially for the first few roads. the playstyle its going for is you have to run to the next road as fast as possible and try and save your ammo this is not always to noticeable which makes me wish there was more hordes spawning behind you right off start to show new players that you need to keep running or else the massive amounts of them will tear through you and to show that you really should save your ammo for the bigger issues ahead.another issue is that you cant shoot in any directionyou choose, which might be intentional but doesnt feel intuitive as you have a crosshair with the mouse but your really only shoot in front of you.Though, overall if you would like a basic game with a survival playstyle and a arcade feeling, then this game is a good one to jump into and pop out of as it even has save files which allows for more tries if you like. though remember to save when you go to the store as the auto save typically puts you in situations you probably are close to losing at."

76561198123412640,Recommended,222980,12800228,"Posted: 5 November, 2014",all,Sam Lilly,"Dead Pixels is a 2D shooter survival horror game. Your main goal in the game is to make your way across a number of streets, shooting and smacking through zombies to survive. Dead zombies will drop cash. Along the way you'll find buildings to raid for useful items like guns, ammo, and valuables. There are also some traders stationed along the otherwise abandoned streets, looking for some good profit from the dire situation I suppose. You can buy all sort of items, weapons, ammo, and upgrades from traders, as well as sell some of your own things for cash. Basically, that's the entire game in a nutshell. Kill zombies, raid buildings, deal with traders, and try to make it to the end without dying. Pretty simple and fun.There IS strategy involved, though. You see, you have a weight limit on what you can carry, and everything outside of ammo will weigh you down. If you go over that capacity, you will become over encumbered, which will result in your movement being reduced. And what's really neat about this is that, the more extra weight you carry, the slower you become. You can even get completely immobilized if you have too much. But you never are forced to strickly carry only what will fit in your capacity, which give you some freedom in what you value: items or your speed. Some items may not be too useful, such as valuables and weaker or duplicate guns, but they can be sold later. So do you hold on to your money makers, or try to just carry the essentials? Also, when at the traders, what skills do you want to upgrade? What will benefit you the most? Do you want to have more powerful shots to use less ammo, or maybe you should work on bargaining so other things will be cheaper in the long run. Should you sell your item here or bring it back to the trader a few streets back that was offering a good sum for it? Is backtracking worth risking possible ammo and health supplies to get more money? There are a lot of tough calls to make and replayability allows you to experiment with different strategies.And let's not forget co op. In co op you have two people working together to survive, which can be helpful and harmful. You get twice the carrying capacity, twice the melee action, and you can do some distraction and splitting tactics with the clumps of zombies. However, you are forced to share all resources, as the shops only have limited amounts in stock. You also have to be careful not to trap another player on the edge of the screen from moving forward of backward. On the bright side, if one of you dies, the other can revive them at a trader... if they can make it there alone. Working together requires planning. You have to share resources. Who needs what more? What upgrades will compliment each other well? How will your playstyles affect each other's? Again, it's a lot to think about.This game does SEEM like each playthrough would be a unique experence. However, I don't think that's quite the case. There ARE a good number of different things as far as guns, valuables, throwable weapons, and items go I suppose. And with the randomization of traders, prices, drops, buildings, guns, ammo... and well... almost everything that's important... the thing is... this randomization hardly changes the gameplay. You still shoot zombies, raid buildings, and visit traders the same way basically every time. The only difference is what they have to offer, what you randomly find, and the exact locations of places. That's about it. There's a case for it being different each time with how you choose to upgrade your character, but since each skill only has a few levels of upgrades, you can easily get close to if not actually max all of your stats in a single playthrough. This all makes the variety a little lacking.Another complain I have is that, while there are a lot of different weapons, they all fit into categories based on their ammo type. This means that, at any given time, you'll probably only carry one gun of each type with you for the sake of convenience and weight management. It makes the game easier to navigate with less guns at a time, but really lacks in giving good variety. Although, there IS some variety in the extra couple of modes and different difficulty settings. So that's nice for slight change ups on essentially the same gameplay.My smallest complaint is that this is one of those games that doesn't really commit to the retro style. Sure, the graphics and some of the sound effects are 8 bit, but the music, other sound effects, and some visual effects are much more modern. Not to mention the controls. The aesthetic is neat, but I guess it feels a little more like a reference to old games rather than reflecting the style. Maybe I'm looking too far into it.I do like some of the music in the game. There's some decent humor in it too. A lot of people might complain about the co op only being local, but I can't blame the game for something it didn't do. The local co op is a blast and honestly, online co op would most likely be laggy and not as fun anyway. This game is a great sleepover game. You and a buddy can just play it over and over for a night and it's tons of simple fun. The controls are a bit awkward at first, not being very retro styled at all. After a bit a play you'll start to get the hand of it and realize how helpful they are. I was assuming there'd be one fire button and one button for grenades, and that they would be used in the direction I was facing. However, instead you use the left and right shoulder buttons to attack left and right. Sounds confusing at first, but it becomes very helpful. Sometmes you'll be running away from zombies but you'll still want to shoot them. Well you can't do both if you have to turn around to face them. This setup let's you more efficiently run and gun. Be careful though, as your melee attack only goes the way you are facing. Overall, I think the controls are pretty intuitive for this kind of game.So, what's the verdict? Well, this game is a lot of simple, good fun. I'd say it's easily worth $5 on here. However, the asking price is only $3. That's a pretty sweet deal already. But if you're still not sure, wait for a sale. I got it on sale for $1 and look how much playtime I got out of it already? Plus, I've seen it go as low as 74 cents. It's definitely a great title to keep in mind when you have leftover Steam wallet funds from card sales or after you bought some other game you really wanted. It's a nice way to not let that extra cash go to waste just sitting there in your Steam wallet. I'd recommend this is you like simple shooters, 8 bit graphics, or zombie survival games. Dead Pixels is pretty cool."

,Not Recommended,222980,23061489,"Posted: 18 May, 2016",all,Whiteswart,"8-bit isometric 2d-shooter with rpg-like grading. It costs very little, and can be a reasonable buy if you are looking to enlarge your games-in-possession number. It can even be fun to play - for an hour or two (if you're still not sick of zombies and 8-bit games). The game even have coop-mode, for extra-fun with friend...I've finished it, get all achievements and overcome all ""challenges"" there. Yet I dislike it much more than ""Deadly 30"" or any other little game I've played recently. Why? Because it's not really hard, it's just very grind-based. It takes helluva time spent on mindless and boring process of collecting cash, to buy more ""upgrades""!And even if one really fell with that game, mastered it by every means... hi-scores chart flooded with cheaters! No point to go hard on it, nobody will ever notice your effort.You know what? It's almost the same principle as with Payday - only hundred times cheaper in any way! I usually prefer indie stuff to the overhyped AAA-projects... not in this case.In short: that game isn't totally bad, its just overestimated itself. Like fingerprint lock, which opens only if you click it over 9000 times.6/10 mark. Playable, but not really fun and very grindy in the long run. Can't recommend it to anyone."

With a cool grindhouse theme and cute pixel art, this game is a must for all couch co-op fans, especially when it can be found really cheap on sale. a fantastic retro sidescrolling take on the zombie shooter genre.Pros:+ Fantasic couch co-op.+ Extra difficulty options. It definitely tests your survivability skills on hardest mode when you have to cross over 10 streets with only a single shop and a ton of zombies.+ The Solution gives a new scenario and a relatively easy way of trying out all the funky weapons as you mow down thousands of zombies.+ Procedurally generated maps for a different experience each time you play.+ Cute pixel art, especially when the zombie's eyes go squinty when they notice you.+ A large selection of cool weapons and upgrades.+ Grindhouse style and music fits very nicely.+ Steam Achievements.Cons:- Partial controller supported only; have to use a mouse to start up the game initially.- The Solution game mode is fairly easy, and doesn't change when difficulty increases, only more zombies to kill, which means more money to spend on a supply of infinite ammo, grenades and guns.- Grenades not that powerful.- May be waiting around a while if you poke a zombie off the bottom of the screen for him to come back on. Only problematic on Survival and Time Attack modes and when fighting bosses on the Original game mode. May last forever if they are also frozen. Can be easily avoided though.My Score: 9/10"

,Recommended,222980,25214299,"Posted: 28 August, 2016",all,Aythadis,"Dead Pixels is a ""Grindhouse"" side-scrolling zombie shooter with some survival elements planted in it, as well as RNG. Dead pixels is your typical zombie survival shooter, but does it VERY well for the price.DP has you running from one end of the street to the other, killing zombies, looting some houses for items/weapons/ammo, trading with merchants, and trying not to die. The number of streets you must traverse all depends on what difficulty you choose or what gamemode. You have 3 different gamemodes. You have a ""Story"" mode that consists of you getting to the end to escape the city and win, a survival mode, and a time attack mode. All will pit you against the hoards of zombies which vary from the common slow moving zombs, to acid spitting, to commando zombs, to mutant zombs, and the rare chance of ""Boss"" zombies.Don't fret though, as you also get a large arsenal to help you. The most common weapons you will find are shotguns, rifles, and pistols. The farther you get in the game (and the harder difficulties,) you will find more powerful weaponry, such as flamethrowers, mini guns, plasma rifles, freeze rays, and even chainsaws. You will also get an assortment of throwing items, like frag grenades, pipe bombs, molotovs, flairs, TNT, and much more. Don't forget about the med kits!Aside from the items, you can also upgrade your character with the money the zombies drop. You can upgrade your max health, run speed, gun skills, melee skills, carrying capacity, bargaining skill, and luck. This adds in the slight RPG aspect to the game which is nice. In the ""Original"" story mode your character starts with nothing for stats, but in ""The Solution"" story, it has all pre-set characters that have different stats and different starting gear.This game presents it's self like an old retro ""Grindhouse"" movie game, and using old pixel style graphics to give it the old school look. All the graphics look great and all feel like they belong in the game, and fit in very well. Each type of zombie all have their own look, the backgrounds look good, and the blood all looks good.There is a few glaring issues though with this game. The biggest one being it has Coop, but it's local coop only. As someone that doesn't have friends, I didn't have anyone to try and complete the game in coop with. I tried to do it myself, but I wasn't very coordinated to do it. The other big problem is Melee. I found once you maxed out the melee skill, you can cake walk the entire game without having to shoot one bullet. I beat the hardest difficulty with no effort because of this.Pros:- Lots of content for the price.- Easy to pick up and play.- Simple Pixel art.- Good music/sounds.- Not much story, but doesn't really need it.- Lots of items/weapons to pick up.- Lots of different zombies and bosses.- Cheap price.- Achievements.Cons:- Can be very repetitive.- Some may not like the old pixel style graphics.- All menus are text based and don't have any graphics/images with them.- Music may get repetitive.- Melee is stupid OP.- Local Coop only.- No Steam Cards.For a $3 game it's a hell of a deal! Lots of bang for you $. If you are just looking for a fun Indi game look no further! I will always recommend this game to everyone."

,Recommended,222980,18746821,"Posted: 29 October, 2015",all,Doc. Sarcastic,"Personal Rating: 8/10What's not to love about this game? A 2D Zombie Sidescroller that features so much stuff it's amazing and I don't know where to begin. I think I should make special mention of the fact that the game is controller compatible, so if you do have a controller then I'd use that. Makes the game a lot easier to play through because some of the keyboard binds are a bit, well, naff.So, there are three sort of gamemodes in this game. There's the original campaign entitled ""Dead Pixels"" where you need to make it through 10 Streets to get to the chopper. This gamemode is extremely fun and I've spent many hours on my Xbox 360 playing the hell out of this game. The controls are tight, there's a large variety of weapons and items to use and there's a very good selection of different zombie types and as you make your way through the streets, which of course increase in difficulty every time. You find a variety of items in different houses that you can then sell to people who have opened up shops. Which is where my two biggest problems are.1. Why would you open a shop in a city that is about to be nuked?You're making money in a zombie infested city, it's like the bloke who runs the store on Dead Rising 2, the name escapes me but he'd sell you stuff for money. Money will have lost all value during a zombie apocalypse, we'll be buying and selling things in bottlecaps, bodyparts and Barry Scott's Cillit Bang seeing as there's that damn much of the♥♥♥♥♥♥ But it just doesn't make sense that people would open up stores in a zombie infested city that's going to blow up.2. If you're going to give us items, give them some purpose.I honestly have no clue why you're loading me up with Teddy Bears, Lighters and pieces of spaghetti but I don't need them. The only thing you can do with them is sell them, which feels pretty cheap because I don't really know what these people are doing with 50 Teddy Bears and the fact that they're worth so much. You can get a good $100 for a battery, which is pretty ridiculous.Other than those two points ""Dead Pixels"" is great.There's two other gamemodes, which is ""The Solution"", which is actually quite interesting and is a sequel to the first campaign. You pick one of six characters to go back into the city, recover a can of baked beans or something and get out of there. But whats the point in that? Where's my motivation? Well, if you do survive and make it back, your crimes will be forgiven. You play a convicted criminal, and this is a way you can clear your name, it's a really nice motive and it's pretty original. There aren't any merchants about this time, you have to call in airdrops from your radio and collect them at the next street. Really adds a sense of conservation to the scenario.The final gamemode is a survival thing and the name escapes me because it's just the usual ""Survive as long as you can"" which every zombie game must include by law right now. Left 4 Dead, Call of Duty World at War had the best Zombie Survival mode out of all the Call of Duty games and of course No More Room in Hell provides us with the realistic, sophisticated zombie game we've always wanted.Dead Pixels is definitely fun and it's a bargain even when it's not on sale, I got this game for 50p and feel like I robbed the developers.

The gameplay is always the same. It's not bad for a side scrolling, 8-bit, Zombie killing game.The  mouse cursor doesn't aim your gun, just points your character in which way he should face. Everything seems overly expensive, even on easy. There isn't enough ammo even if you spend all your money on it. So you end up just running past everything. I got half way through the game on easy, just running past everything when it decided to crash.If you stand and fight you will quickly find ourself low on ammo. THe game could easily run two players LAN or Internet, but refuses to do so. Local Co-op only. Which is better then nothing. It might be fun to grab a friend and hook up a controler for him, keyboard for you, and see how far you can get.If you can pick this game up on sale, it will give you an hour or two of fun.

What a blast~ It's quite simple and has very simple rpg elements such as buying and sellings goods as well as getting more money for selling something to a merchant that they really wanted. I have yet to try the local co-op unfortunately but the single player is simple blast your way through zombies goodness. It has a retro feel of course because of the graphics but I also felt nostalgia playing this game.UPDATE: I finally played local co-op with a buddy of mine and it makes the game much more intense and fun. For the simplicity of the game it really is quite strategic. If a merchant only has 2 boxes of handgun rounds and 1 box of shells and one player buys it all, there is no ammo left for the other player to buy. You can enter the menu and discard items; however it wont discard them, it will give your partner the oppourtunity to take it. So if you want to lighten your load by all means discard. But if your partner has a more powerful shotgun and you a stronger pistol but you each have the opposite ammo, you can trade and the great thing about it is you can select the exact amount of bullets to give, or just give all with the push of one button. This really added depth that I didn't even know the game had because you won't experience that in single player. This also goes for items such as medipacks and throwable items such as grenades and flares. This game is retro in every way, even in the sense of game like Double Dragon and more modern Super Smash Bros in the sense that they're amazing games made 10X better with a partner. I recommend this game absolutely. Especially if you're a fan of pick up and play and/or retro style games. It may become tedious in single player if you don't really use all it has to offer but in multiplayer it is non-stop fun. I cannot wait for Dead Pixels 2 as it promises 4 player online co-op but it's been so long and no news. For a price of $3.99 you honestly can't go wrong and it supports developers like this who create great content for a reasonable price.It has great achievments as well such as 1968 which you get when you kill that many zombies. A reference to Night of The Living Dead.It has tons of zombie media references including tons of Resident Evil references. From the Burton Magnum to the Redfield Carbine Rifle and the Valentine Bold Action. There is also a Weker somthing but I can't quite remember it. The premise is also similar to Day of The Dead in which they have to get to a helicopter and escapre. Although in the movie it's not much to get to the chopper. In the game however you have 30 blocks to go through and keep an eye out for any doors on the upper part of the screen as you can enter them for loot and weapons. Also be mindful you can go into garages which many people may not realize unless by chance. When you clear a building out it'll have a red painted X over it so you know. Also traders tend to have a green arrow pointing towards their door.Okay, ennough rambling about the game. Buy it and have a blast. I recommend using a gamepad however it isn't necessary. That will just be personal preference but it seems much better in my opinion with the gamepad. Right trigger shoot right. Left trigger, shoot left.Top 10 Indie game for sure."

I wasn't expecting to put as many hours into it as I have since most of the people that reviewed it didn't even play the game for more than an hour, but it has some pretty cool features. There's a variation of weapons from pistols, shotguns, bolt rifles, grenades, fireworks to distract your enemies and so on, about 10-15 different zombies, an upgrade system for your character, and a few game modes.Dead Pixels is basically a wave based campaign mode that gets harder and longer as you raise the difficulty and ends once you reach the extraction point. The Solution gives you the choice of a few characters to choose from with already upgraded attributes and your goal is to make it to the nuclear facility to trigger an explosion that will wipe out the city. This mode was my favorite because you have to make it all the way there, without traders to buy goods from, (you get ammo and guns from looting and calling in drop boxes from your commander), and then run back before the nuclear reactor explodes. It sounds annoying, but it's the best mode in my opinion. And survival. Would it really be a zombie game without survival?I only have a few problems with this game. The hardest difficulty mode is ridiculous. It should be called impossible mode. Yes, you can beat it, but when you switch from hard mode to hardest mode, you rarely get any weapons or ammo and traders really only appear at the beginning of the game and at the end. May as well just get rid of the traders and force the player to bash his way through. Hardest difficulty isn't bad because it's hard, it's bad because it's extremely cheap and significantly unbalanced. My other complaint is really a recommendation. Just add bosses and it will vary the feeling of the game instead of running constantly down streets shooting the same zombies. Also, the achievements seem buggy, so you could be looking at a few extra hours just to find ways of unlocking them, even when you already did what they said.If you see this game on sale and you like zombies, pick it up. Otherwise, wait for Dead Pixels 2 or just let the game be."

The gameplay is what makes this game great. The weapons feel like they have impact, and you can choose to run and gun, take out the enemies in front of you, or save time and ammo by running through the mobs awaiting you. Looting houses is fun, sorting out the things you need and the things you dont need, but why not be able to explore the house? It could be a bit boring if it wasn't done right, but it would be more entertaining than a blank menu, and all the zombies stopping dead in their tracks until you get out. It's a good game, but a flawed one. I like it, especially the fact that there is 2 player local co-op. I give it a 6/10. It's worth a try, especially if you feel like a good arcade game."

Maybe I was missing something as I was not playing co-op (no online, though (kinda lazy)) and I didn't get far enough to see the more ""interesting"" zombies that are shown on the main menu, but from what i've played, this isn't worth too much of your time."
,Not Recommended,222980,31495550,Posted: 1 May,all,Cdr Knob Cat,"As dull as ditchwater.Once you've played a few streets, you've played them all. The streets largely feel the same. There's not much variety in the look of the zombies and the way they behave and sound. The music is out of place given the game's slow pace. The grain effect is justa  gimmick - the game doesn't have enough style to give it a ""old"" atmosphere. The story is... well, who cares?On the positive side, the guns felt good, the RPG-lite elements aren't too bad (though the looting was unexciting), and the bosses showed some imagination.My biggest gripe though: the hardest difficulty. What afrustrating grind. 30 streets, minimal ammo and supplies, none of the good guns, and way too many zombies. In many places, the zombies are replaced as fast as you kill them. Given how little ammo you get, you're forced to use melee and risk getting overwhelmed, or just run. You can collect a lot of cash, but there's no way to spend it because the shops have next to nothing. Sure, this is meant to be challenging, but surely it's meant to be fun too?It's a pity more time wasn't spend on design. Dead Pixels 2 looks like a huge improvement; hopefully it actually is one."

I never thought it would be much of a game, it was on sale for 99 cents and I bought it just on the off chance it would be good, and because it was so cheap.Recently I was talking about one of my favorite old NES games, River City Ransom, and had asked a friend if he knew of anything similar that is on the PC. This is the game he mentioned.And while I do not think this game is better than River City Ransom, or even close to as good. It definitely scratches that itch I had for a similar game.The controls are nice and responsive, the movement is fluid, and the gameplay is challenging enough. You can loot abandoned buildings, then turn around and sell the items you find to traders that have storefronts randomly throughout the game and use those funds ot buy weapons/ammo/health kits form them. The traders also have a 'wanted' option to click when in their store, and they name an item that they want and they offer high amounts of money in exchange.The game also has level progression and slight RPG elements, skill upgrades, a nice assortment of weapons. Weapons which have stats that you can compare.Overall I'm pleased with the game so far, and although i havent put in a whole lot of time with it yet, i can see im going to enjoy it a lot. But i also see that it's going to get quite repetitive, which may or may not be a bad thing.I definitely would reccomend this to anyone whos into retro gameplay. at ANY price, the $2.99 price tag when it's not on sale is nothing, it's well worth that.7.5/10"

It has really good controller and local co-op support that was a ton of fun for my friend and I to play (Him on a PS3 controller and me on a 360 controller). Dead Pixels has a good amount of content with a story and survival mode, that is fairly challenging and is surprisingly addictive. For a $1.01 it is surprisingly polished and has a pretty hilarious storyline. There is a large variety of zombies that all have different amounts of health and abilities. Also throughout the game you'll find many buildings to loot and traders to buy weapons and ammo, and sell valuables.There are simple RPG elements throughout the game that allow you to upgrade your player with enhancments such as; Run Speed, Weapon Damage, Health, Melee and Strength. These upgrades all cost a pretty penny though, and I guarentee you'll be running low on money the first couple hours you play, just because of the mass amount of junk there is to buy. I find myself overencumbered all the time just because I feel like I'll use some items eventually, even though I usually don't.The wide variety of weapons is also a really interesting mechanic especially since there limit to how much you can carry, also there isn't one dominate weapon for there is a down side to every weapons strengths. For example, the Chainsaw can shred zombies up but you need to get close and there is a limited amount of gasoline you can carry. The Burton assault rifle has really good range and damage, but blows through ammo ridiculously fast.In the end Dead Pixels deserves a 9/10, It's a solid Indie game with no real downside except for the lack of online Co-Op. There is also no way to change options unless you quit to the launcher which got pretty annoying while setting up a keyboard and mouse, which most people won't have to do."

Your goal in the game is to make it a specified number of blocks (levels) without dying so that you can escape the zombie-infested city. Along the way you kill hundreds of zombies, scavenge for supplies, and trade for better gear and skill training.I recommend this as a game to jump into and play when the mood strikes especially if you have a friend to play with. Though it's not in-depth zombie survival by any means, few games on that market can compete for the old-school local co-op experience that has earned this game a place in my library."

My only complaint on it is, that the bargain perk is completely worthless & I wish there was more upgrades & more levels of the upgrades.  Thats one reason why the bargain perk is worthless.  For the high cost of that skill VS what it saves you in $, youre better off ignoring it till everything else is maxed out first, & then maxing the bargain out just to get the achievment.Any way even those probs dont take away the overall quality & fun of this game.

Not only that but its definately one of the greatest zombie survival games.GAMEPLAY: One of my least favorite parts about zombie games these day is how unnecessarily complicated they are. And I understand why they do this for the most part (i.e. more content, lacking in interesting features, etc), but things like that in a zombie game tarnishes the zombie formula that i enjoy. For lack of a better example, look at Left 4 Dead in its most basic form its just a stareotypical zombie game with a good gib system, but if you add an element like coop for example and build apon that you have yourself one of (if not) the best zombie games ever. I believe Dead Pixel excels in the element that it adds to this otherwise average zombie game, that element being survival. Also its gameplay has the charm of an old arcade game.Music:The sound track fits the overall tone of the game. Its also not very repeative, nor boring to listen to.Visuals:To me this game is very visually appealing, but art is valued by the eye of the beholder."

It's that kind of run and gun deal that you'd see in an arcade. So refreshing from what people have been trying to do with zombies lately. They're not made for drama, they're animate dead bodies that do nothing but consume and need to be pumped with lead and that's what you do in Dead Pixels.It gets its rogue-like categorization from being what I like to call run-based wherein you go through a randomly generated map from beginning to end and get increasingly stronger new items. I like it. It's good all the way down to the price. I just wish there was a little more variety to everything and classes to pick from (which iskind ofwhat you can do in the second game mode). It appears that Dead Pixels II will improve on these things.I finished all 3 modes on all 3 difficulties within a few hours but like I said this is priced right for what it is.

It seemed really fun at first, but when the unnecessary technical issues started and the only help from the dev is ""uninstall and then re-install framework 4.0. Didn't work? Sorry, buy my next game!"" you'll want your 3 bucks back. Just basic gameplay has been an issue with this game, but the dev just shrugs his shoulders and keeps working on the sequel. I have a feeling a majority of the positive reviews have come from people who only played the game for an hour before they wrote their review, and that makes sense since the game was still good for caual fun at $2.99. However, once the gameplay problems start, and they will start, the only help you'll get from the dev is to reinstall and a sales pitch for dead pixels 2.Also, as many other people have pointed out, the availability of shopkeepers and ammo is really, really unbalanced, so the only consistent winning strategy is to loot every house, sell the loot and buy ammo if you find a shop, and NEVER SHOOT AT A ZOMBIE. Does running past zombies sound fun in a game that is trying to sell itself to you as a zombie shooter? Do you want to know the devs response to this? ""Sorry. This problem will be fixed in next game. Promise. Get next game and everything will be fine.""Not being able to even ration out your ammo like this is a survival style horror game because it's possible there will be no more ammo found for 15 to 17 of the 20 streets in the game isn't fun or rogue-like; it's lazy programming.Regardless, you heard the dev: don't buy this game, buy the next game."

Let’s get rocking.The GoodDespite its minimalist approach to the zombie killing genre, DP brings quite a bit to the table in terms of usable weapons and items. There is a good smattering of firearms (most of which have monikers that are nods to other famous zombie franchises), there are several options of throwing weapons (grenades and the like), and there are a ton of items that you’ll find lying around to sell to vendors.DP keeps it simple all around the board (for the most part). Controls are simple, the story is straightforward, and you can only progress in one direction. It doesn’t get any less complicated.Dead Pixels, while simple, is actually pretty fun.The BadAs far as I can tell, there’s no way to see what guns use what ammunition. I can’t stress how annoying this is.The MehSome of the zombies that crop up in the late game soak up an unreasonable amount of ammunition before they kick the bucket a second time. It can get frustrating, especially when you’re short on ammo.Verdict: YeaFor three dollars? Hell yeah you should get Dead Pixels. If you hate it, you’re only out three bucks.

,Recommended,222980,10144163,"Posted: 16 May, 2014",all,Mantaloupe,"This is an interesting specimen. Sure, zombie games are dime-a-dozen at this point and at first glance this'd seem like a side-scrolling ripoff of any other modern zombie survival game like DayZ or Left 4 Dead. It's rather different. It blends certain RPG elements with a myriad of weapons and a beat-em-up map layout.The object of the game is to cross several streets littered with the walking dead in order to reach the survivors after a zombie epidemic plagues the city. Along the way you can loot buildings, trade supplies and save at shops, and, of course, kill the undead. The enemy variety is neat too. You get several different classes of zombies with different amounts of health, damage outputs, and attack styles. For the most part you get ones that walk towards you and attack. Eventually you reach spitter-like enemies that fire green globs. Considering each direct hit takes away 20 hitpoints (You start out with 200), I'd suggest dodging those. You also have a couple zombie bosses.Overall it's a fun game to burn time on. You have different gamemodes and if you have friends around you can join up on LAN and fight zombies together. Although online capability would really be the best over anything. So, if you have a few dollars to spend, I'd recommend picking this little gem up."

Each mode is a different type of playing the first mode. The first mode is Dead Pixels where you are a survivor and you loot stores. The second mode is the Solution where you can be your favorite zombie writers such as Robert Kirkman (creator of the Walking Dead) and you can be Max Brooks (creator of The Zombie Survival Guide and World War Z). In the second mode you play it the exact same way you play the first mode but your connected to the goverment and if you press a button the goverment pops up and you can buy and sell stuff. In the third mode you do a survival round. They have waves of zombies and you only get about 10 seconds to go into the stores. You can also do Time Attack which gives you a limited time to complete one wave. The third mode is just a fun way to see if your ready to play story mode. I hope you have as much fun as I did playing this game because I highly recommend it.

Tad bit repetive but modes vary them up enough.In depth:Performance - The game is 8-bit style any machine from the last 10 years can max this out. If you cant than you should not be on steam. Its crisp 60fps but on games of this particular art style lower frame rates don’t tend to matter as much. Still nice addition of course.Graphics - 8-bit retro art style is nice and works well with the zombie theme. Though it begs the question; Why? It is needed. It is a nice throwback to older days but it screams novice even though the game and its features are quite varied. Bu it works well enough and it was trending (for some reason) when the game was released.Gameplay - Simple yet sophisticated. No recoil, drop off or any complex mechanic. Shoot and it dies. So why do I say it’s quite complex and varied? Gun types and other equipment are what make this game a good one. Each weapon has its pros, cons and their own feel. A double barrel blasts multiple zombies apart in a cone shape versus a sniper which punches zombies through in a line. Not to mention all the different ammo types and elements. Zombie types also vary combat up with enough though more would be advantageous. The survival mode is probably my favourite. Having to loot houses for resources in favour on shooting every zombie in sight. Best moment for me was having to run 20 streets back to the heli with no ammo thinking I was at the end. Coop is local which is a shame but actually works quite well and is surprisingly fun.Replayability - Considering the campaign, the survival horde mode and other modes which are more of a rough like run system it does have quite a lot of content for a small price. They are all similar, killing zombies, but what do you expect? It’s a zombie game. I am not expected to only stare at them, I’m expecting to blow them apart and look for resources.Conclusion - This game is, for what it is, is good. It’s kept my attention for longer than I expected and considering the amount of equipment and modes to vary it up I had a lot of fun.If you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow my curator group:http://steamcommunity.com/groups/FALLENV3GAS#curationhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/222980/"

It's WAY deeper than it looks. You and your partner (if you want to have a really good time) have to make your way from street to street, kicking in doors, scavenging for supplies, using ammo carefully (no spray and pray here), deciding on upgrades vs. ammo vs items vs. new weapons and stay alive doing so while mashing the crap out of the undead and seeing what they had in their wallets. Markets change from street to street and not all vendors sell items for the same price or even sell the same items.With all of this, there really isn't much micromanagement which is amazing. It's fairly quick and you stay in the action, but you have to use your head as much as your twitchy-twitchy fingers. At times it can be pretty tense in that awesome way that we all like to pay for tense experiences that we call SUPER FUN VIDEO GAMES.So, go buy it. Then play it.M13"

(2) While there is scavenging, inventory management, and skill allocation in the game, your two major concerns in this game are still killing zombies and having enough things to kill zombies with.

I didn't understand the game at first, but once I picked it up it was a fun challenge. It's by no means elegant or deep, but it is fun. At first I thought I had to kill all the zombies, but then I realized that the real strategy to the game was much more complex. The supplies are scarce, including weapons, ammo, and medkits. You have to search through houses, buy and sell stuff to merchants, upgrade your stats, and strategically move through each section of the levels while conserving as much of your supplies as you can before reaching the next merchant. Once you run out of ammo it's pretty difficult in the later levels, so build up ammo as soon as possible and avoid wasting it all to kill only a few zombies. In the later levels there are waayyy more zombies than you can possibly hope to kill, so the real strategy becomes maneuvering between waves while shooting down hordes with your machine gun or shotgun, killing many at once in order to get lots of money without using up too much ammo. It's a super fun game! Pick it up when it's on sale!"

,Recommended,222980,26511124,"Posted: 9 November, 2016",all,DumpCityMatt,"Dead Pixels is a fun little gem for fans of zombies, or the NES era. This game gives you the story in three segments, each giving you the option to play solo or local co-op. They are Dead Pixels, The Solution, and Last Stand.Dead Pixels is the main campaign, in which you go from street to street, blasting zombies, collecting loot, and visiting stores, all in search of escape. The number of streets you have to traverse, depends on which difficulty you select.The Solution is very similar, except it's more of a get in/get out scenario. This time you play as one of several convicts, each with unique, non-upgradeable stats.Last Stand is more of a survival mode, where you see how many waves of the undead you can endure.Now, onto the main components of the game.Graphics- The character sprites borrow their style from the first six Mega Man games, so there's no shortage of charm there. The level of detail is on par with plenty of late 80's/early 90's NES games(Most notably Mega Man and River City Ransom). There's also this neat film grain effect to make it feel like a classic Romero zombie flick.Sound- Not too much to say here. A few metal tracks, some spooky prologue music, and a loungey elevator tune account for the whole soundtrack. The sound effects include chomps, groans, gunshots, explosions, and cash registers. Nothing crazy, but it does the job just fine. Though there is this popping and crackling sound that gives the effect of a damaged film reel, that adds to the cinematic feel.Gameplay- Though it's not exactly a beat 'em up, it's set up like one. The game draws heavy inspiration from River City Ransom. When you kill zombies, they drop cash that you can spend on weapons/items/stat upgrades at the nearest shop. You can also loot empty buildings. Some loot is useful, while other loot only exists to be flipped for some quick cash. Another point of interest is the encumberment system. Your character has a weight limit. IIf you pick up one too many items, you'll begin to move slower. The more you exceed that limit, the slower you move, which forces you to manage your inventory. The analog stick moves your character, while the triggers allow you to shoot left or right. Shoulder button tosses grenades, while the face buttons are your melee attacks, and menu navigation. The gameplay is simple, yet addictive....like an arcade game with some RPG elements.Overall, this is a great game, with lots of little references to iconic works of zombie fiction thrown in for good measure. If this sounds like your bag, I'd strongly suggest giving it a try."

This was clearly released at the height of the low-res/retro indie craze of the early 2010s, so all of the zombies and the main character have a blocky vibe remniscent of something from the NES. And my first 10 minutes gave me a sense of comforting, gory and fairly stupid fun.My 3 hours: I played through the intro campaign for my 3 hour test-run with the game, consisting of 20 levels in a forgotten and zombie plagued US city in the 80s or 90s. It opens with a standard-issue b-movie explanation for the zombie apocalypse and gives the main character a clear goal, reaching an encampment of survivors who are 20 streets away. In the parlance of the game, a street is a level, which appears to take up some 5 or 6 city blocks , and includes a slowly escalating zombie threat, houses to loot, and a trader who sells weapons, ammo and medical supplies. Additionally, the trader seems to be the only place you can save, so reaching the trader in each level feels like a bit of a milestone.The main challenge in the game comes from resource management and crisis aversion. Much of the time, you'll be encountering small groups of zombies, but as levels go on, they form larger and more dangerous mobs. Knowing when to slowly take them out with melee attacks, and when to use firearms to take out larger groups more quickly seems to be the key to success here, and it provides a pretty satisfying sense of continuity to the longer campaign. I found myself constantly tempted to use melee, and by the end of the game had a crazy stockpile of ammunition (but had taken a pretty large number of hits). I think there are probably other legitimate strategies to be used.Character advancement adds an additional layer here, and allows you to figure out styles that work fairly well for you over time. Based on my playthrough, a player earns enough points to upgrade several, but not all skills up to their maximum. The upgrades that I took early on significantly changed the way I played the game, allowing me to be quicker, and better at melee takedowns. When I reached the waves of zombies in the final level, I felt like I had earned the ability to blast my way through hordes of zombies and reach my eventual goal.HighMy Highlight: The game really came together for me when I had a huge stockpile of ammo, the ability to move quickly, and a shotgun with a high rate of fire. Being able to decide to shred my way through hordes of the undead and then mop up with melee felt pretty satisfying.My Verdict: This is pretty satisfying for mostly shutting down the brain and getting out some violent urges in a cutesy retro world, so I'd recommend it for a steam sale purchase.Next post will be on September 4th, covering Divinity: Original Sin"

It's not reallya beat-em-up because you rely mostly on firearms, but the gameplay is similar.The combat in Dead Pixels is fun, but what really makes the gameplay engaging is the huge variety of weapons, items, and upgrades, combined with randomly generated layouts so you'll find different gear at different times and no two games will play out the same. Each firearm has damage, range, rate of fire, and penetration stats, which  makes different weapons work well for different situations. Maybe you're digging the range and power of a bolt action until you run into mobs and then you start blasting away with the double-barrel. Maybe you try to focus on shotguns and keep that going for a while until you run out of shells, then switch to a carbine and find you're liking that better. Maybe you have more fun setting everything on fire with dirt-cheap flares, maybe you're rolling in dough and cackle as you blow things away with $700 sticks of dynamite.I don't think this will hold most people's attention for 40 hours, but it's a lot of fun and even better if you can find someone to play coop with you."

Graphics and Sound are basic but fit the games style as a homage to the 8/16-bit eras. It's also full of of great references, mostly to Resident Evil but there a few other horror references tucked away (such as Ash's boomstick from Evil Dead).In between all the zombie shooting and side scrolling there is the opportunity to visit shops (With bizzarely calm shop keepers in them. There are hundreds of zombies outside guys, runaway!) In these shops you can upgrade abilities, weapons or ammunition. This does add some much needed depth and replay value to the game as it lets you change the way you play.In my case I stocked up on med packs, upgraded my health and speed and killed zombies only when necessarily. When I first started I was trying to kill everything but I soon realised what a drain on ammo this was! Judging from other playthroughs I've seen other people didn't let that put them off, buying loads of weapons and ammo and upgrading their combat abilities in order to massacre hundreds of zombies.Definitely worth a buy considering its regularly available for about the price of a Freddo, and you're guaranteed at least 20 minutes more fun out of Dead Pixels.http://jamesvssteam.blogspot.co.uk/"

Sure it isn't very advanced looking, but the gameplay is relatively decent for what it's worth, and the coop system is actually quite awesome considering the simplicity of the game. I can only recommend this game if you have people to play with, otherwise it gets a little stale going solo, it gets absolutely crazy towards the end with multiple players and I had a lot of fun with it."

A lone wolf prowls the streets, using carnage as his only tool as he seeks escape from the living hell that his city has become.The game is quite fun in short stints. It has scaling difficulty depending on how far along you get, with minibosses and a final boss. These super enemies are not always required to be defeated, and if you want to try to run you can probably survive trying to do the fleeing-in-terror thing.I decided to punch my way through. Because that's the kind of man I am.Shotguns, assault rifles, pistols, grenades, and more all are at your disposal as you wreak hot havoc on the pixelated streets, spilling blood, goop, and smoking bullet shells all over the place.At first your quest doesn't seem so difficult. A handful of generic Romero-Zombies shambling in your way are hardly a challenge, but as the swarms show up, and different variets make their existence known, you'll find yourself having to think fast and decide which tactic is best on the fly to defeat your ravenous foes; For tonight, the dead are hungry.I think this game is very much worth the price."

The visuals are great, especially the film grain. You can search houses or garages for items, which really can help lower the overall difficulty. There are three different scenes, which makes the game quite long. The Last Stand also offers countless replay value. Sure, there are times when the character gets stuck, but for a MYR8 indie game its fine."
