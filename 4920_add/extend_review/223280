I only paid $2, but no updates, no achievements, literally no effort put into doing anything other than a bare bones port is just pathetic. If ever they come back to this and put some effort or new levels in, I'll change my review."

,Recommended,223280,10363558,"Posted: 5 June, 2014",all,BrightSide,"Cut the Rope is a fun game that can be easily used as a time waster or to play if you're bored. However, if you're a completionist (like me) this game can become rage enducing. The puzzles become more complicated as you progress through the game. And although I question it's logic at some points, it's still very fun and would recommend to anyone that's a fan of simple puzzle games like this."

I almost had to ask for help a few times.Almost.I really wish they'd sync their ports, though.  The number of levels included in the Steam, iPad and Chrome ports are all over the place.  And this game is justbeggingfor a level editor + Steam Workshop.Still, a fantastic game, especially for $5.  9/10"

,Not Recommended,223280,30917046,Posted: 2 April,all,'∞ Frogg,"I'm sorry, but as much as I wanted to like this game, I simply can't. Now, if you like fast paced, reaction time based, movement clicker games, fine, then this is probably fantastic at that.But the game is marketed as a puzzle game, and I went in expecting it to be just that, a puzzle game. Instead, I'm stuck trying to do impossibly fast reaction clicks, just to barely have a chance to pass, let alone ace a level.For people who like that kind of thing, great, but it's not what it was advertised as, and I find myself frustrated that there are excessively fast timers on very very early levels.2/5. Because it was cute, and I REALLY liked the cardboard box levels, before they turned it into a completely different game by the second set of levels."

The game is colourful, well designed, fun to play, a tad challenging and perfect for pick up and play, this however doesn't translate well to the PC market.9/15 ""Get it on iPad."""

Cut the Rope is brought into your PC so that you can engage in the delights of the rope-cutting puzzles! Satisfy yourself with a classic game that will be and should be played for all of time.

,Not Recommended,223280,32056524,Posted: 29 May,all,Jet Edge (✿ ♥‿♥),"I love this game on touch screen devices. Back when i picked this up in 2013 i played it for 5 hours strasight because I just didnt have a smartphone, and it was one of my favorite games. Now that I have a pretty good pc this port is pretty much unplayable. Everything is tied to framerate, so the game moves at like 10 times the speed it should. It looks pretty funny at first but gets old once the levels start getting harder. Just download an android emulator like Bluestacks and don't buy this product, it isn't worth it."
