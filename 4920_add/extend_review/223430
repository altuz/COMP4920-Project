The scale is really weird and difficult to describe.  Rather than feeling like you're flying around in a spaceship inside an enormous space station, it feels like you're driving a Micro Machine around someone's living room; nothing's got a sense of proportion or frame of reference and the design of the space station interiors seems designed to confuse, with little in the way of landmarks or anything that might actually make it look like it could be inhabited by actual people.The combat mechanics are basic and the menu/inventory system is a nightmare to navigate, let alone understand.The voice acting is pretty poor and what little I could glean of the story from the opening mission made no sense, being totally without context.  After the first mission ends you're dumped into a world/solar-system map with no idea where to go next or why.  Pretty much wherever you do decide to go, some people will autoamtically attack you, but it's not made clear why that's happening either, or if any of the ships are meant to be friendly.Finally, the setting is so utterly absurd that it does nothing to help this sorry excuse for a game.  The idea that anything on/around Earth could survive its destruction by the Sun exploding is total nonsense.  That functioning societies could spring up from the debris and even start building new structures in a scant few years after an apocalyptic event is the metaphorical icing on this turd of a cake.I cannot urge you strongly enough - do not buy this game under any circumstances."
,Not Recommended,223430,7970627,"Posted: 8 December, 2013",all,Spootaloo,"Miner Wars 2081 promises epic space battles, but instead gives you a frustrating game of resource micro-management. Every amenity on your ship - from ammunition to oxygen to fuel - is limited, and runs out rather quickly. Even if the vast, bland environments were actually worth looking around, the game simply wouldn't allow you any exploration due to your limited resources. When you finally actually do get to fighting, the balance is atrocious, with some enemies barely leaving a scratch on your hull, while others in the same area annihilate you as soon as you get in range.I was hoping for a spiritual successor to the Descent/Freespace series, as those remain among my favorites of all time, but sadly this is nowhere near pulling it off. Stay far, far away."

If you try to play singleplayer you will find the odds to be ridiculously uneven against you, with the developers hoping you will pay to unlock cheats. If you play multiplayer it is no different except that even if you survive til the end together, at least one of you will run out of fuel before reaching the end, because they do not even bother to give both of you fuel/ammo/health pickups.Do not get this game. I'm disappointed that steam continues to support such a complete waste of money. Keep an eye out for other ""indie"" games that are done by similarly corrupt developers."

If like me you have a joystick and think that that will work you will struggle even more (as the unified sensitivity will make it unplayable)the graphics are meh, for the price I wouldn't really expect much more, but it is VERY dull with little to help the colours of space other than a ridiculous bright sky (would you call it a sky?)The HUD is broken, yep, broken;the guns seem to be a 2D image that renders behind, yes - BEHIND, the 3d objects in the scene (I didn't even realise that my ship HAD guns until I left the starter station and found weird 2d objects moving arround with me clipping through every other visible object.mining doesn't make sense (at least to me it doesn't)the AI of both your teammate and enemies is pretty uselessupgrades seem pointless.For a game claiming to be ""miner wars"" there is very little mining and the war involved is hardly worth fighting.save your money."

It's grossely misleading - class action lawsuit misleading. And I don't use that term lightly. They compare it to Descent with a fully destructable enviornment, but it's more like an amateur Unity project.First off, you need fuel. Remember those old Nintendo games where you had to constantly pick up fuel to keep moving? The ones where  taking just a second longer to get the fuel meant losing the game? Well, imagine that in a 3d enviornment while you're being shot at and you have no clue where the fuel tanks are. Do you get into cover (yes, you have to take cover in your space fighter)? Then you just used fuel and probably can't reach the next tank. Do you rush to the next tank and fight from there? Then you'll get your oxygen system taken out and die.The AI always knows where you are and has pixel perfect aiming, even when you're trying to shoot back at a target no bigger than a pixel. There are hardened turrets stationed everywhere.So some stuff is destructable. Tunnel through it and flank them? Nope. That uses your fuel. You HAVE to take the shortest route possible or you run out of gas.Even better, if you're fighting outside, there is a solar flare every 10 seconds or so. And yes, it will kill you. So you have to spend more fuel trying to hide in a meteor cave (how does this protect you from a SOLAR FLARE again?) or try to dash through a cluster of enemies which while tear you to pieces.On the odd chance you do collect some resources, they're just used for a really basic crafting system.Bottom line - stay away from this garbage and the developer. They also made Space Engineers, and I refuse to give them another dime until they fix this game."

76561198047757624,Not Recommended,223430,15660847,"Posted: 2 May, 2015",all,Tavis,"To start: I loved playing this game. To a point. The controls seemed awkward at first, but once I got the hang of them, it turned into sheer awesome. That is, for a while. I've played through every single level of this game. Twice, actually. First complaint: I have never received a single achievement. There are 12 achievements. They are all based on story progression. I have none of them. I beat the game twice. There is an issue there.Next, the... sheer incompleteness of it. There are a huge number of extra missions and things, and... Well, you see, by the end of the game you have three allies. Before a certain point, you only have one. Then, I think, you go up to three. Then back down to two, then up to three again. No matter what time during the game you venture to the optional side-missions, you WILL have all three allies. Even if you have no idea who the hell they are, or if you currently believe that ally to have DIED HEROICALLY. He's just hanging around with you in a sidemission.But that's not even the worst of it. Some of the sidemissions are just plain crap. You have, basically, a bunch of random crap that's really not useful at all and maybe a few mineable things just... there. Around you. Blow 'em up if you like. Maybe a few enemies will wordlessly appear. There's no mission. It's just... There. Pardon for the lack of specifics, but it's been a while since I last played, but... One of the 'sidemissions' is New Moscow, or something like that. The Russian's big main city... Er... Sorry, did I say city? I meant a few defense turrets mounted on buildings that you can blow up if you shoot a hell of a lot. There's not even a shop.Which reminds me, if you expect all the shops to be actually functional, you'll be sorely disappointed. There's quite a few that are just completely and totally nonfunctional. Heck, the 'shop here' button shows up. Mash it 'til your keyboard breaks. Have fun. No point to it.And then there's the mining. I could have enjoyed that so much. I love mining in games. I LOVE open world sandboxes. But you know what? I hated it here. I'd prefer to just waste a missile on a uranium deposit instead of take the time to actually mine it. And I tried. Oh, I tried SO hard. But the default mining equipment is the ONLY mining equipment. There's no way to enhance it. So the 3 or 4 seconds it takes to mine ANYTHING will ALWAYS be that way. And it's just plain not worth it. Not in the slightest. MAYBE if you're mining one of the really, really valuable resources, but still. You can find more money by just looking around and looting things. And don't bother with the secret rooms. They have nice loot, but not nice enough.And beyond that, sometimes the game just stacks crap against you to a stupid extent. One level, the offensive turrets are literally indestructible. Literally. You actually HAVE TO disable them through the control console for them, or you won't even be able to progress in the mission. I blew up the generator that powers the console for those turrets... And wound up trapped in the level, basically. I couldn't do anything at all because I had disabled the console which I literally could not progress without accessing. And the game just... kept going. Didn't really care.And one of the secret rooms I mentioned before? I found it. I could see inside it. I then spent ALL MY AMMO and EVERYTHING I could think of on trying to get into the damned thing. There was nothing. At all. Not in the slightest.This game is a brilliant, beautiful START. ... But it's only a START. It needs to be refined. It needs to be FINISHED. It needs to be added to.And the worst part? The very end of it is just an enormous cliffhanger. And I haven't heard of Miner Wars 2082. They got their money and they're done.You see this on sale? Maybe you get it. Just don't expect things to be perfect. It won't be perfect. It'll disappoint you in a dozen different ways. But if you can get used to the controls, like I did, you might just find you enjoy it enough to bother paying... say... five bucks.I don't recommend it at-price. If you get a sale, MAYBE. But don't expect it to be complete. You've gotta take it into your own hands a little. And don't be afraid to change the keybindings. I definitely had to."

From reading the other reviews, it appears that the game was a disappointment, but I never got to experience that, becaue it simply didn't work for me.  The game claims that it runs on XP, but my XP machine, which happens to be able to run any game (later than 2000) that I've attempted to play, crashed on startup.  I googled the problem and it appeared to be fairly common.  I wasn't surprised considering that the game (at the time) was new, and simply gave the developers a helpful email that featured what I attempted to do to fix the problem, and gave them my crash logs.Someone emailed me back, and very politely thanked me for the helpful email, and promised that they would fix the issue.  After trying to launch it again each week for the next month, it wasn't ever resolved, and I lost interest in the game.  Some six months later, I attempted to play again, figuring that it must be fixed by now, and yet it wasn't.  So much for promising that they would fix it.

But starting into the first mission, it was mostly a total confusing mess:The controls are strange and not very movement friendly. Most of the time you find yourself helpless rotating around, looking for the enemy shooting at you, never having the feeling of flying through space. It feels like controlling the spectator camera of an FPS game, that controlling a space ship moving through vacuum of space.The missions are unclear and hard to understand. You shoot at everything that shoots at you and try to follow the objective keys, which is very irritating and boring.The game is full of stuff, that seems to be really important, but is never explained to you. It seems that you need fuel, air and ammunition, also you can somehow get new weapons and equipment. But all of that is unclear and really hard to understand. Often you find yourself getting shot and starting to loose air until you die, which isnt very satisfying. Also in Coop you instantly respawn with 1% health, just to get killed again.Last but not least: Disconnects, asyncron gameplay and bugs. It wasnt very easy to maintain a nice multiplayer round.All in all, we never got to the end of the first chapter and deinstalled the game. I know, many of the problems were a player-side problem of understanding the game, but it is so frustrating and boring, that you simply dont have the mood to understand it.Beside of that it lures you with an open world, that simply doesnt exist.

The gameplay is relatively simple, your ship is flown in a bigger ship that travels around a certain area of space which is controlled by different countries or factions. There is a storyline to follow and is a decent one at that. Like every game I play though I base its greatness largely on the game play. This game is about what you can expect from any first person space shooter game with a multitude of upgrades available (from armor, to weapons, to ammunition type, engines etc...). Adding the ability to dig through rock or mine adds a different paradigm to the game (... sort of. You can mine and then sell the rocks/element types). There is a different drill though if you press ""m"" that just rips through any asteroid in your way. This is not only pretty cool to mess with physical features of the map, but launching a few missiles also changes the shape or hole size in the asteroid.Although I personally like playing it, for it to really stand out and be something else and differentiate itself from any other game I can't really say. It is definitely a fun game to play, and worth a buy if on sale. The amount of control you are able to have on how your ship moves/rotates/displaces itself is quite notable in this game. If you really like having control of your space craft, this is it!

Runs badly on hardware way above recommended spec.The developers appear to have made a pretty involved implementation of an Elite / Freelancer style game here, with mining, equipment hacking and terrain alteration. However, they promptly make an utter hash of it by starting their - extremely complicated - game in media res, with alarms and explosions and characters screaming at the player. There's a reason why Freelancer starts its player in a calm spot and introduces its game mechanics one at a time. Miner Wars 2081 completely missed that concept. This flaw culminates in characters screaming at you while you are trying to read tutorial pop-ups.Miner Wars 2081 tries to have a combat oriented campaign but sabotages itself in several ways. The combat design is atrocious and the missions devolve into ""please now fly at a turret which will kill you in 0.5 seconds and is already pointing at you"". The level designs heavily punish attempting to do anything amusing or sneaky to go around or sneak up on enemies. For no apparent reason, there isn't a quicksave / quickload feature, only unmarked autosave checkpoints, so the game becomes tedious and painful if you get stuck at some obstacle, having to repeat the same actions over and over again to get back to where you can try again. Specifically because of the fact that they've tried to implement a broad Elite style game with features like mining, there's inventory micro-management gumming up the combat sections."

Steam had Descent 1/2/3 on the store at one time, really old Gems from the birth of the PC Gaming Era. Miner Wars 2081 is a fast paced 6x shooter with a flat story line attached to the side.  This mashup of a game.So you pilot a space faring mining drone, capsule, pod; Ship. It’s hard for me as a space sim fanatic to say you’re in a Ship in this game. Anyways.  It has your typical storyline with the Russians as a copout for the enemy.As you progress through the game you are able to buy new weapons that go on your Arms on the Ship, stronger shields, different hulls, but you never really bust out of First person Cockpit View.  To me everything in this game feels small, which is weird because the maps in this game are actually very large in physical graphical size. I get lost on the maps sometimes, it just has a weird feel to me.Your ship also has a mining towcable + grinder on the front that you extend into rocks and pick up everything from gas to precious metals that you can sell for ammo and upgrades.Final Thoughts: With as many game reviews as I do, this one is the hardest one for me to explain with words.

You would think if the world was destroyed by a giant solar flare, the odds of surviing would be impossible, especially to make a comeback with advanced technology. Also you wonder they all survived with limited resources.The story was strange and confusing, with you really not understanding much about what's going on and the ongoing fighting between factions. You don't really know your faction or why you're there, only having the main goal of finding the alien artifact and whatnot.I liked the idea that ships were a little customizable and there were quite a few that you could buy later on but it felt like there was really no scaling. Combat wasn't exactly the smoothest ever when you try to manuever with the AIs and the ship controls. Sometimes it was a pain to a hang of it and sometimes you might hit the wrong button, throwing off your flying and aiming. Speaking of AIs... they were such a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ Though they do follow you around, they do so with the intent to do everything they can to get into your way, especially if you are trying to dig through asteroids with missels. As far as I can tell, they're just there with no reason and don't get targeted very much.Since they are trying to advertise the game Space Engineers I'll throw in my thoughts on why you shouldn't get it. Like several sandbox games, you are gathering resources and building... except there is no survivalist aspects in the game. Besides the threat of you crashing your ship, there is no challenge in the game except those of building. Cool, you can build your own spaceship but that's all there is to it.

This is a grinding FPS where you are constantly piloting a spacehsip that you can customise with different weapon and tool loadouts (i.e. shielding, mining & digging tools). It's constanty action-packed so you won't have an idle minute of gametime (unless you decide to mine instead), the blue trail that indicates where you need to go during a mission is a great feature that saves a lot of faffing around. Visually, it's a bit cluttered but I like this game because I contributed some money to it during development and got to see it slowly evolve. ***"
