They build in complexity rather quickly, and it always feels like you're just barely able to keep your head above water. You will be kept in a perpetual state of not-drowning-just-yet. But every once in a while, you hook a pair, lance immediately, and hook your next without thinking about it. You get flying along, jumping from one pair to the next, not thinking. Not seeing or hearing. You areexperiencing.And three seconds later, you're ruined. But for those three seconds, you knew what it was to be a god. And god was drugs."

I can’t even believe this game was developed on the id Tech 4 (Doom 3) game engine. Oh how I envy the developers so much. This is one of those moments where I’d say, “I wish I made a game like this!”They did something incredible with the music in this game. I’ve always been seeking one where the music is completely dynamic based on the actions you take or do. By dynamic I mean you have a base rhythm but can add instruments at any interval and make it sound just like one musical masterpiece. And this game achieves this!I swear sometimes, I feel like I’m even making my own music when playing this game. And it’s the only game I know where if you crash into an enemy and slow down or whatever … it just sounds and looks so cool! Tell me how many games out there make you want to do mistakes like taking damage? LOL … none right? Wrong! Dyad …Quite a chill and psychedelic trance type of music in this game. So for those that don’t like that genre I can see that may be something like half the greatness gone. But lucky for me I love this type of genre of music.I find the gameplay progressive. I’m not comparing, but if we take a look at other indie games like, Beat Hazard or Audio Surf, the gameplay and rules just doesn’t change at all. In Dyad, it’s progressive. New enemies, objects and variations to how you move are introduced throughout what I would call the campaigns. And it's not annoying, it's very fun!I rate this game 12/10. I wish I was sitting on a couch playing this game next to sauce and just speaking my mind just like in the trailer. It’s bloody hilarious! Watch it! But seriously I can see how this game can make one do something like that.EDIT: Changed my mind about not liking the chargers after playing Just Take a Pinch level. They're awesome in combination with invincibility shields. Also corrected that the dudes in the trailer aren't the Dev's, but they're funny as heck!I would also like to elaborate on my second paragraph. This game is the inverse to games like Beat Hazard, Audio Surf, Symphony ... etc. The thing about those games is you see visuals customized or laid out to variations in your music. With Dyad, the music is has been customised to the way you play. So everytime you hook an enemy, graze, lance, pick up an invincibility shield, ride a zipline ... it activates a sound effect that seemlessly blends in with the background music. Don't get me wrong, the visuals are definately a big part of the game and is in dynamic sync with the music, but I was kind of dissapointed with The Cynical Brit's video on Dyad where he basically commentated about everything except the sound. You really have to have an ear for Dyad ... kinda like Osu! ... it's not just about visually interacting, you need to hear the rhythm. imho.Also the infinite level is genius. I was avoiding it for a bit because I thought it really was infinite. But one day I wanted to chill and just started played it expecting no ending. But surprise! It's like the equivalent to having a story-like conclusion to a game without a story ... lol."

,Recommended,223450,14292632,"Posted: 1 February, 2015",all,chairbender,"It may have only taken me 2 hours to beat the whole thing, but I can safely say this is probably one of my favorite games ever.It's everything it promises to be - psychadelic, mind-bending, and hallucinogenic, while also being engaging, reasonably challenging and having a solid mechanical foundation and gameplay.First of all, it does a great job of easing you into the game as it adds new mechanics. It starts out simple to let you learn and ramps up from there. There's really only ever 4 buttons to worry about, too: left and right, hook, and lance. The fact that it is so simple control-wise means it's that much easier to feel immersed in the game and not worry about what your hands are doing.That's hardly what makes it great, though. Each level feels like a unique audio-visual experience. In order to complete level goals, you have to be constantly looking ahead down the ""pipe"". As you perform certain actions, the visuals AND audio react accordingly. The fact that you have to be watching in a certain way and processing what is happening visually, all while everything is changing and responding to what you are doing, is what makes this such a psychadelic, engaging experience.If you're used to arcade-style games where the focus is on precise, responsive controls and clearly defined, easy-to-read game state, you might feel put off by the idea of this game at first. Everything is constantly moving and waving around and oscillating, which you would think would make it hard to keep track of what is happening. As far as I can tell, though, this is intentional and doesn't hurt your ability to start to gain mastery over the game. As the game state changes (for example, as you speed up), the way you need to visually process and respond to the game changes as well, and the visuals and audio respond to keep feeding you the information you need.The ""ending"" is a huge treat; an audio-visual dessert which somehow manages to top the psychadelic experience of each of the levels.Once you've played through the game, there's plenty of replayability playing through individual stages to get to the top of the leaderboards and competing with your friends or the general public, going for trophies, or even just enjoying the remix mode. However, it seems the friends leaderboard isn't functional (at least for me), so I was a little disappointed by that. Also, the leaderboards don't seem to let me scroll to the next page, so I can only ever see the top 20 or so scores in the world. Perhaps this will get fixed later.Definitely get this game unless you are concerned about the overwhelming visuals causing diziness or something like that (it wasn't a problem for me and I get motion sickness pretty easily)."

,Recommended,223450,11010616,"Posted: 1 July, 2014",all,mignone_roy20,"TL;DRThis game game can become really messy for your eyes, make sure to play in a well lit room or RIP eyes. Also I have no idea how to play with a keyboard.Besides those two little problems, Dyad is a really interesting game. It becomes pretty addictive once you really get into it because there are so much things that get added in the gameplay as you play. But I'd like a option to have the game running on ""Windowed no borders"". It'd be super.Let's get into things. In Dyad, you basically are a little... non identified thing with kinda tentacles (just what I think, maybe it has a name) and you must grab onto ""enemies"" being little light orbs. You must make pairs of enemies that are the same colors to boost your speed and get more points. That's basically the base of the game.But it's not only that. Sometimes, you just need to make pairs and finish the level. Sometimes, it's a race and you need to finish is in less time as possible. Buuut, you can also start to ""graze"" the enemies by grabbing them. A circle will appear around them and then you just need to pass close to them. This'll build up a ""lancing"" bar, then you'll be able to ""lance"" on the enemies. This is like a super boost and you can hit the enemies like that to go faster and make the lancing last longer (I think? I'm not sure about this)Those are the only things I tried so far. There must be some other modes and special things to do. Also the music and sounds are really great.Since I always have my game controller plugged, I still haven't figured out how to play with a keyboard. But the experience with the controller is really enjoyable and easy to play. You just need the buttons and left joystick. And fingers. And hands. And eyes. And a brain. You get it.This is the kind of game you'll want to play a level over and over again to master it and get a high score (at the time I'm writing this I hit the 9th place of a level on the global leaderboards after trying a level a few times). The fact that you can edit the way you play the levels after finishing them once (""remix"") is really interesting and I really like it. You can even play a non-ending game just to, like, relax or practice without being scared of a game over or the end of the level. But I don't know what some of the things do though.If you're epileptic this is not the game you want to play at all. As you play, the colors and lights become more intense. I myself am not someone who's really sensitive to that, but at one point I had to take a break because it was too much. I couldn't even play the damn level anymore (the game reminded me of Super Hexagon. Must take breaks while playing this or you just slowly become crazy). Also I'm someone who tends to change windows a lot when I play (to take breaks and all) and when it's full screen it tends to freeze the game and sometimes make it crash. An option to have the game windowed but without borders would be really cool. I don't want to touch the launching options because I don't know if it works just like TF2.After this kinda novella I can only say ""Yes, I recommend this game""."

It's what I like to call a tunnel racer, even though it's not always a racer, strictly speaking. These tunnels are filled with enemies in different colors. Linking two of these enemies together will give you a speed boost and grazing these enemies will fill up your Lancer meter. The Lancer meter will torpedo you forward when activated, letting you spear through enemies and power-ups (I guess they can be called that). Now, I know I called this some sort of racer, and I'm sticking with it, but it's not in the traditional sense. Every mission has different objectives and finishing it with 3 stars will unlock Trophy mode and Remix mode. Trophy mode is a even harder version of the same mission and that's where you'll be able to get your achievements. Some are possible, others are just impossible to get. But it's always fun, because the missions are short and usually can be completed within a few minutes.A fun experience, but the price is way too steep.

I watched nothing but colours for five straight minutes and somehow it was the most rewarding ending a game has ever offered.""I got Dyad some time after I first saw it being played by its developer, Shawn McGrath, on a Twitch stream. It looked incredible. Like, I wasn't sure what to think. I just wanted to have a go. After eventually buying and playing the game for myself, I'm still not sure what to think. It's probably better if you just don't think, plug your senses into the game and feel it. Feel the game. Feel the game playing you as you play the game.Dyad is kind of post-genre but definitely arcade in nature. Imagine playing Tempest but with the pace of Burnout. That's kind of how it feels to play. The actual gameplay is essentially pair matching similar to the match-three style gameplay of Audiosurf. You need to be able to think quickly while remaining relaxed. Otherwise you'll never be able to figure out what you're doing, never mind wou're supposed to be doing. Also like Audiosurf (or any other rhythm game), Dyad lends itself well to short bursts of play as well as long sessions of score chasing on a single level.As confusing as it looks, (and it always looks confusing, even if you've played it,) it's a remarkably simple game. The concepts are fed to you at a satisfying pace, increasing the difficulty of the game as you progress through each level. To start with, you just have to ""hook"" two consecutive ""enemies"" of the same colour as many times as is required to complete the level while also avoiding the enemies themselves. However, as you encounter different types of enemies and you learn to use your second ability, ""lance"", things get difficult quickly as the complexity layers on and you start moving ever quicker through the infinite tube the game takes place within.If you like fast-paced, twitch gameplay, rhythm game-like mechanics, and are willing to be blinded for a few seconds for going on a lucky streak, you'll probably enjoy a quick session of Dyad or perhaps a long one if you're feeling competitive."

The second is a trophy level where you have to achieve some adrenaline-releasing task that requires expertise of the aforementioned mechanic.

Many of the other reviews describe the effect like being on drugs, and I agree. It feels amazing and responsive when you pull off a level perfectly, and while the difficulty ramps up rather quickly I never felt as if I was out of control. This is definitely a point in its favour, because the graphics are... trippy, to say the least. Imagine the Doctor Who opening without the Tardis or the music, then synch up some weird electronic beat and underlying melody,add in weird beeps and boops when you hook an enemy and that is pretty much the experience of Dyad.Plus you have taken all the drugs."

Before any of you even THINK about buying this game, let me tell you there is nearly NOTHING to do in it. All there is is exactly as the game looks in the screenshots. Here's a description:You're a... Thing. And you travel through these tubular things, and have to collect things while avoiding things. That's... about all it is. Level after boring psychadelic level, there's just nothing new. They introduce a new ""Enemy"" about halfway through the game, but several levels afterwards you'll just get stuck like me. The levels become rediculously impossible (only halfway through the game) and there aren't that many levels in the game, but I'd be amazed if you could even get THAT far because it's SO BORING."

It's a bit of an investment to get it to click, but when it starts clicking... All I have to say, is, if you like music experience games which do not succumb to note memorization schemes, then this is for you. Set aside an hour. It has some accessibility issues since parsing the psychedelic graphics is a bit hard, but it's also part of the experience. So, invest some time in it, it'll give you a very nice experience in return!"
