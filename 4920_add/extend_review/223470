Yes, it can be a gruesome, unsavory, albeit cartoony, experience, and the game does push you to that end most of the time, but it can also be a open world game that allows you to explore a satirical world filled with both hilarious situations and expectations that speak volumes about paranoid, and in many ways complacent, mid-2000s America. In many ways, it shows how trivial the concerns of the time actually were in the grand scheme of things. Postal 2 needs to be given more credit for pushing the envelope for games; what was once considered taboo was torn apart and amplified in this game. Wholly recommended as an experience."

The story takes place throughout one week. Each day you complete mundane tasks created by your nagging wife. As the days go on the town gets progressively worse with protestors, terrorists, and even the undead.GameplayGameplay consists of first-person shooting with a handful variety of armaments. The difficulty scales from Liebermode to Really ♥♥♥♥ing Hard. On harder difficulties, health items are instantly used on pick-up and civilians will attack on site. This game features secret weapons and ammo giving you an advantage on what's to come. There's a plethora of achievements each consisting of a reference like Loverboy's songEverybody's Working for the WeekendandModern Family. Even though this game was created  back in April 13, 2003, the game still gets weekly updates from glorious Running With Scissors, and still can beat today's'next-gen'games.Pros:Original StorylineComical murderStill gets updatesModsAchievementsReplay valueCons:Combat kinda feels mundaneSome glitchesNo co-op campaignCan't kill Mike J enoughSo, what are you waiting for?

The first game was a little too Columbine for my tastes, but when Postal 2 came out in '03, I think the series really came into its own, commercially and artistically. The whole game has a clear, crisp level of violence, and a new sheen of consumerate decadence that really gives the mindlessness a big boost. It's been compared to Manhunt, but I think Postal has a far more sarcastic, cynical sense of humor.In '04, RWS released this, Apocalypse Weekend, their most insane content addon. I think their undisputed addition from this was the destruciton of Paradise, an ending so gratifying, most people don't pay attention to the message. But they should, because it's not just about the pleasures of destroying and moving on, and the importance of the post-Cold War era, it's also a personal statement about how Vince feels about the Middle East in general.HEY PAUL"

Also make sure to check out my little bit shorter Paradise Lost review.http://steamcommunity.com/id/xlucyferx666/recommended/360960/Postal 2.One of the best games I have ever played in my life.I mean it serious. I know this game for many years already and played definitely over 300 hours in it (CD & DVD Version). And now it came to Steam. This is the best thing that could have ever happened to it. I bought the game quite often in different editions like the Boxed Edition, Fudge Pack Edition and 10th Anniversary Edition. I also have some other items like a talking Krotchy doll.Its amazing how much work and heart the developers put into this game.It still gets updates 12 years after the actual release. Probably the longest supported game in history? Actually it wasnt updated for several years to be honest. It was quite around Postal for many years. Not even Postal 3 changed this fact, especially because it wasnt as good as the most people wanted it to be. It wasnt developed by RWS anyway. I think this game was ok but couldnt reach Postal 2 in any way. I personally do not recommend Postal 3 because its buggy and glitchy as hell. Maybe wait for some proper patches/mods one day...Now to the actual game review.In Postal 2 you play as The Postal Dude. One of my favorite game characters of all time. A man living with his wife in a motorhome in the city Paradise.You have to do normal things like buying stuff in the store or returning books to the mall. Or getting a christmas tree. Those sort of tasks you have to finish to progress in the game.But this isnt often as easy as we would wish. The crazy city Paradise comes always into our ways. The police, protestors, priests, god*amn even Osama wants us dead. But we can defend ourself and attack back with several weapons. One of the biggest weapon collections ever seen in a game. This Steam versions has even more than the old version. A lot of AWP and ED weapons have been added. Not all but many which doubles the fun. Pistols, shotgun, scissors to rocket launchers. We can also pee on everyone and everything. It was never easier to take a p*ss. Also the gore has been raised extremely. Now you have the same gore amount that was included in the addon Apocalypse Weekend, which is btw included. We can also grab our dog or cat to fight against the citizens but cats are mostly just useful to silence your guns. No, I'm not kidding. There are also other items ingame like ""health pipes"". Yeah, you know what I mean. In addition to that there are a lot of secrets and goodies ingame! The game is actually open world but with several levels that are only visitable on certain days. Yes the game has days. Monday to Sunday actually. The standard Postal 2 was Monday to Friday but the addon added Saturday and Sunday. You can play Monday to Friday or Saturday and Sunday or the whole week. Everything is possible when you start a new game. Oh and because we came to the start a new game part. There are so many difficulties! I cant remember such a big difficulty amount in any other game. No clue how many exactly there are but definitely over 10! Every of those difficulties offers a different game experience. From the people who hit you with shovels to people who shoot with rocket launchers at you and who are insulted already when you look at them. There is everything. I think that should be enough about the game itself.The game also has a multiplayer but I think most here wont care for it anyway, its not much played. Its not horrible but kinda outdated, but no wonder. There are still sometimes a few players to find.The game itself runs with the Unreal Engine 1.5 or 2 when im right. Some hybrid of it.So it means that this game is dated. If you await nice fancy graphics, you are at the wrong address. But the engine does what is should. It has also been updated with the latest patches released on Steam. Before Steam it was kinda unstable and crashed often. This problems are by now fixed. Also Steamworks has been integrated. Also archievements and trading cards. Workshop exists now too. So everything that a actual game needs, right?But there are so many fixes and changes by now, that I cant even say them all.Best to check out the store page. Incredible work by the devs!Well, what else should I say.Postal 2 has nothing really to do with Postal 1, yes I played this also.It was often criticized in the media and banned from a lot of countries due to its gore and seriousness. Doesnt hit everyones taste. I really feel the love the developers put into this game and Postal 2 is between my favorite games of all time. And this game list consists out of Crysis, Fallout etc. I often dare to think about Postal 2 being an Indie game, even if it is. I really love to see this game here on Steam. I bet it will never really die and also todays gamers will always have access to it. It is often on sale for a joke price so definitely a must have! By now there is even a new DLC which adds many hours of new gameplay. I will review this in a seperate review.Positives:- Big free roam map- Includes Apocalypse Weekend- Biggest amount of secrets ever- Unique in nearly every way- Great main character- Gary Coleman- Biggest arsenal of weapons ever- You can pee on everyone and everything- You can finish the game without any violence- GORE- Voice of Rick Hunter (Postal Dude)- Still support after 12 years- Many new features and fixes since Steam release- Osama is ALIVE- Realife Simulator!- Still working Multiplayer with a few players- New addon after 12 years, holy hell!- Steamworks integration, Workshop, MODS!- Best black humor ever in a videogameNegative:- Dated Graphics- Might not hit everyones tasteReplayability: Very HighMy score? 9.5/10Many people may dont understand this rating but thats just how it is.This game really serves as a love letter to fans. I never recall any other developer to put so much work, especially after so many years, into a game.Postal 2 was between one of my first PC games, no crap.For me this game is unique how it is and cant be compared to any other game.And another part, I just felt like I have to add it...THANK YOU Running With Scissors for making this amazing game for us.And even keeping up the support, releasing patches and even a whole new DLC!This is simply so amazing. This is the reason why I think Running With Scissors is the best developer ever. No kidding. Nobody else puts so much work into a loved videogame franchise!Its stuff like that, that I would wish from other developers.There are so many games by now that just wasted to dust and often doesnt even run properly anymore. I dont think it would be so hard to release hotfixes for them. But 90% of all devs dont do this."

,Recommended,223470,8067848,"Posted: 16 December, 2013",all,Joe,"Have you ever had one of 'those' days?This is THE violent video game. This game was one of many others that parents all across the United States wanted banned so that their children wouldn't have their eyes spoiled by its horrific imagery. Now you can experience all of its excessive, abhorrent content on Steam.First of all let me say that this game is a personal favorite of mine. I had played it at a friend's place way back and loved it, but never had a chance to buy it. So when I saw that it was on Greenlight I thought 'Hey, why not?' and gave it an enthusiastic thumbs up. The day it released I bought it, pretty excited to experience it again nearly a decade later. I was not disappointed.This game has aged considerably well, considering it was made in 2003. However, its age does show.Pros:+The gameplay, controls, and combat are tight. Being how old this game is, there was no dime-a-dozen cover mechanics or regenerating health, so strafing, bunny-hopping, and repeatedly crouching up and down behind low cover while firing are some tactics that work. Reloading is for losers and newbies, so feel free to waste all three-hundred shots of your AR15.+The comedy of this game hasn't lost its humor. Being an over exaggerated parody of life in the United States during 2003, a lot of the jokes made still hold water to this day. Overbearing banks, corrupt priests, trigger-happy cops, stereotypical Islamic terrorists, religious cults, cannibals,♥♥♥♥♥♥y rednecks, people simply not giving a damn, the whole shebang viewed and commentated from the eyes of a sarcastic cynic just trying to get through a pretty hectic week.+Techincally, this game is pretty stable and has some interesting features. I haven't seen any game-breaking bugs, but I have had a crash or two. If you ever get stuck somewhere in the world (which is bound to happen considering it's a free-roaming sandbox) the game teleports you to a nearby spot free of charge. There are also some small pieces of unimportant mechanics that are superflorus but fun. Exploring around is rewarded with interesting to downright strange results. Attaching a cat to your barrel to suppress your weapon is a neat but useless feature. Placing a donut on the ground and taking a leak on it will have an interesting outcome. Speaking of which, this game still has the best urine physics I've ever seen in a game... oddly enough.+A large, open world to explore and wreak havoc in.+A multiplayer, though I don't know how active it is.Cons:-The gameplay feels old. You've probably seen or played a game that had similar combat to this and that may be a downside to you. The gameplay isn't also 'realistic'. So no aiming down the sights or jelly on your face when you get shot.-The comedy of this game will turn off a lot of people, considering how carebear people have gotten on the internet lately. If you are easily offended by racial stereotypes, large amounts of cursing, ultraviolence, animal abuse, graphic vomitting and urination, homophobia, whatever, then this game is definitely not for you; stick to Gone Home, that will probably be more your speed.-Quite short, with a very simple story so if you are looking for a 'cinamatic adventure' you should probably look elsewhere.All in all, I recommend this game if just for a single playthrough. You want a numbered score? 8/10.I regret nothing."

You can choose to go through the whole game WITHOUT going postal. So its more of a game of right or wrong.Other than that lets start the review.This game is always being updated so don't worry about that. They usually release a update around a holiday such as halloween 2014. In the halloween 2014 update instead of terrorists there are SPOOKY SCARY SKELETONS THAT COME FROM THE GATES OF HELL (and yes I literally mean they come from the gates of hell). With the steam workshop feature there is a infinite amount of things you can do in postal 2.So this is classified as a open world, fps, sandbox game. If you were to relate this to garry's mod than you're completly wrong. This game is nothing like garry's mod. If you were to relate it GTA you'd still be wrong and besides GTA is third person anyway :special:. Postal 2 is its own kind of game. It's one of a kind and there will truely be nothing like this for decades to come. Hell, Postal 3 couldn't even compete with Postal 2. I'd say the closest a game got to postal 2 would be goat simulator. It goes on the same principle as postal 2. You can choose to act like a normal goat or go around rampaging the city. See how the two are alike? But, still, the two games are completly different.Who said you going postal was a bad thing? You can go and destroy terrorist organizations, Protest/deal with protesters, etc. Or you can go on a rampage with cat silencers and bombs and gasoline. That works too.I would reccomend you to buy this game ASAP. It's worth every penny."

,Recommended,223470,31142103,Posted: 14 April,all,Captain MooMoos,"This is a long review, so if you want a brief summary of why I recommendPostal 2skip toResultsand read from there.Running with Scissors creates a game so brutal and offensive it was banned in many countries upon its original release. Postal 2 offers more than just comedy by providing a fun and intense first person shooter in an non-repetitive environment.Story:The game starts with The Dude, clearly a play off the Big Lebowski who has moved to a small town to take up the career of being a video game star. But life isn’t so easy for The Dude, who must also live his day-to-day life. When playing Postal 2 your missions are to complete the tasks The Dude’s wife gives him, how you do this is up to you. You play The Dude’s life for up to an entire week, and somehow things just get drastically more ridiculous as you move forward.Campaign:Depending on your sense of humor you may love this game, or absolutely hate it. Interestingly Postal 2 is able to achieve dynamic levels of comedy with blatant racism, sexual innuendos, extreme violence, tv/movie references, and much more. Remember this game was made back in 2003, so if you can’t get past older games graphics then this may not be for you. The campaign is as long/short as you make it, if you gun through it you can do it in an hour and a half, if you take your sweet time like myself it’ll probably last 8-10 hours. The game also comes with a variety of different difficulties, I don’t know all their names but there are about 15 or so difficulty levels. Hopefully this should allow everyone to be able to enjoy this game, from the casual relaxed to the extreme.Gameplay:The game is focused around completing errands off a to-do-list that ends up leading to a crazy adventure of terrorists, strip clubs, religious radicals, military, local law enforcement, and even the demons of hell. The game plays like a standard FPS from the early 2000’s. Kind of more a Half/Life style combat as if it could have been made using Gary’s Mod.The map is open world, with directional quests. Sometimes quests will pull you into an area which is more of a guided level, but when you come out the campaign goes back to open world. Overall with the DLC offers a relatively decent length campaign on typical FPS standards.With the incredibly unique weapon choices, from putting a cat on your rifle as a silencer to lighting your foes with gasoline “Postal 2” offers an array of fun and creative ways to go Postal.Hints:>In the police station all the way on the top floor in the locker room is an officer uniform. IF you grab this uniform you can go nuts killing people and the cops won’t care. This uniform will last one day, its well worth if you want to make one day incredibly easy.>You will get multiple weapons that occupy single slots – for example: you will have a sign post, sledge hammer, hatchet, police baton, scythe all occupy number 1. To switch them just keep pressing 1 on your keyboard. This applies to weapons in other slots as well. This may seem obvious, but I didn’t realize I had multiple weapons until the Thursday.Results:I’d definitely recommend this game, even at full price; although, if you’re hesitant it goes on sale frequently. The campaign is a good length, and even when you’re done you may want to just go back and try playing the game with a different flare. It has a decent difficulty curve, and the optional gameplay style provides a dynamic experience. Not I’d avoid this game if you’re not able to take a joke or are overly sensitive regarding politics and religion.Pros:+Open world map (for 2003 that’s quite impressive).+Funny campaign with amusing story.+Loads of weapons to choose from.+Secrets, got to love those old game secrets.Cons:-Have to keep running with his annoying wife’s errands. I mean really, does she need Milk or Gary Colemans autograph?"
,Recommended,223470,20677322,"Posted: 22 January, 2016",all,Wolf,"Game name: Postal 2Game score: 9.5/10Reviewed by: WolfIn Summary...Postal 2 is the successor to the contraversial series,Postal, which hit the stores on April 12, 2003. The story features The Postal Dude, or just Dude for short, and his adventures across the week doing various errands. Things more than often turn hasty, leaving a simple chore of ""picking up milk"" into slaying some Al-Queda members. Each day features a list of 3-4 errands to run, across all 5 days of the week (and 2 in the ""Apocalypse Weekend"" mode). The DLC,Paradise Lost, features almost the same layout: 5 days of errands, but no weekend. All in all, it's quite a different experience, yet not in a bad way at all, more of a substantial addition to the FPS family.Controls:WASD - MovementQ - KickE - Holster weaponR - Unzip pants (to pee)C - CrouchK - SuicideG - Yell somethingMouse - LookMousewheel - Switch weapons (scroll)1 - 0 - Choose different weapons if availableLeft click - Primary fireRight click - Secondary fireSpace - JumpZ - Drop weaponE/Enter - Use item or hand it overX - Drop itemM - Map[ or ] - Select item in inventoryGameplay:Each day you're able to do various tasks in order to complete the day. There's usually 3 tasks (some days have added tasks after one is completed, so 4). The days are outlined like a normal week; Monday - Friday, and the option to play a bonus mode called Apocalypse Weekend, which is Saturday and Sunday.Starting from your lovely home, Dude usually leaves with his wife ♥♥♥♥♥ing at him, as the game says, and given a task from her to do like pick up a book or cash a check. These tasks always turn hasty, ranging from psycho video game activists to terrorists attacking you and trying to kill you. Equipped with many weapons, the Dude has plenty to keep him protected, as well as sometimes a helper (like Champ, his dog) to assist you in your quests.Graphics:Graphics are not the games strong point, if only the only thing keeping anyone from buying this. Please, do not take this in the wrong way, the game is everything as interesting as if it was made in UE4. Realize it's a game from 2003, and this should help.Now, there's mods and everything to help things pop, I found one to make the mountains less flat and still doesn't decrease performance. There's also ENB's to reshade everything to your liking to not make it so bright, and also HD textures as well. I'm not saying the graphics are a super huge deal that this is a necessity, but some prefer to have the options to do so. I played the whole game and the DLC before I realised there were these things, and I still loved it.Game Balance:There's 10+ modes to choose from in difficulty, ranging from Easy to Impossible. Changing modes does not hinder your experience, each mode has the same content. Most people just play on Liebermode (easiest of all) just to play through the end. I have played all modes, including Postal. Jesus Christ it was a trip.OtherI need more DLC for this game, or a working Share the Pain for Windows10, please RWS.Final Rating:9.5/10In Conclusion:This game is an excellent example of how an FPS should feel, and with its customizability and humor, I literally did not go wrong buying this game. It was super fun playing through it, and every day was a blast. I wish there was more to it or at least a few more DLC's but that honestly is less priority than the real game. Concider picking it up if you have the money, it's often on sale on Steam for $1.Please feel free to follow mycuration pagefor more recommendations. Thanks for reading!"

While the errands are similar to what most of us would call “missions”, their objectives are often much more simple than the missions we’ve become accustomed to in RPGs and other titles. In a testament to this, one of the first errands you have to run is to go to the store and get some milk. The atmosphere of the store is hilarious, as the middle eastern music blasts and the shopkeeper insults all of the patrons in his shop. The brilliance of Postal 2 is the non-linear manner in which you can complete your errands. Do you just pay for the milk or do you just grab it and then fight your way out of the store, hitting everyone in your path with a shovel? The choice is yours.

You wield a variety of weapons; ranging from shovels to sledgehammers to M16's and shotguns, the latter two of which you can ""accessorize"" with a feline. The difficulty balance is great as well. Difficulty only really changes how tough enemies are versus how tough you are, plus some fun modifiers on high diffs. (i.e everyone has guns, hates you, or both.)Is violence not your style? Well, POSTAL 2 can be beaten non-lethally. Get ready to abuse the tazer and your own♥♥♥♥♥♥Seriously. POSTAL 2's notorious slogan is ""It's only as violent as you are.""Not only that, but this Steam version, dubbed POSTAL 2 Complete, you have the luxury of the Apocalypse Weekend expansion, and a modified version of the Week In Paradise mod! (meaning you can play Monday-Sunday in one run but you figured that out unless you are an idiot)This is by no means a ""new"" game. It was released in 2003, but RWS still updates the Steam version! Really!Honestly, if this is what you've been craving for a while, get it at full price. It's only 10 bucks CDN!If you are unsure, wait for a sale.

Go get some milk, pick up your paycheck, return an overdue library book, etc. Unfortunately for the Dude, not everyone likes him, or what he does. You have to worry about doing things wrong in front of the police or armed citizens, not to mention the groups of people that hate you depending on each day, Taliban, and the military. The game proves, however, that you don't need a buff dude fighting aliens to be a badass, all you need is a scrawny ginger in an alien T-shirt and duster.The game itself is one of the most interesting early open-world shooters I've ever seen so far. Different areas of the map open up depending on the in-game day you're on, and there are many hidden areas to discover within Paradise. Exploration doesn't go unrewarded, however, since you can find many weapons, ammo, and other useful items by exploring your environment. Even places that would be inaccessible can be reached by simply walking across telephone wires.Gameplay in Postal 2 is a bit like GTA, minus the Auto. There are cars in the game, but they serve as explosive props rather than drivable objects. You have a wanted bar that lets you know just how much the police want to cuff you, as well as an inventory used to store your items. Aside from that, other things set it apart from most shooters of its style. You can silence a gun with a cat, throw a boomeranging machete, befriend a dog to kill enemies, and more. I like that the game breaks the fourth wall often as well, as Postal Dude makes remarks about the level design and uselessness of the cars. The game devs themselves, Running With Scissors, are a major part of the game's story.I rate Postal 2 a 9.5/10. This is one of the best early shooters I've played, and definitely one to pick up."

Figures, this one way to leave a mark in the gaming history. Whether you can take the game's sense of humour depends on if a policeman throwing up from♥♥♥♥♥♥soaked doughnut you gave them seems like something you can stomach. If that seemed like fun - knock yourself out, if ""the dumbest thing I've ever read"" came up to your mind Postal 2 might just not be the right game.Jokes aside Postal 2 is a fairly decent game especially for its times. It hasn't aged well graphically but it's old looks feel  suitable for the game's nasty content. Game offers plenty of freedom. Paradise City offers near-open-world expierience being a net of smaller levels that player unlocks while progressing through the game. That results in number of paths to choose but also means it takes 5-6 loading screens to get from one city end to the other. Old but gold, eh?The player is offered a variety of means to complete Dude's daily errands. We don't get to play with a maniac not to act as such but being a moderatly decent citizen, waiting in queues, paying for services is also an option. What game really seems to be missing is an option to just play your week like a peacful average joe without having to fight literally anyone. Wouldn't that be ironic? Since the fight is obligatory and a major part of the game you can't simply pass by Postal's huge arsenal. There are over 30 means of destruction from sledgehammer through sawed-off shotgun to a mini-nuke launcher.Postal 2 also offers a ridiculous amount of difficulty levels. I can highly reccomend trying out the Postal difficulty. You wouldn't imagine how much of an achievement crossing a street can be. Apocalypse Weekend is not a bad addition although it dosen't quite seem to keep up with the base game. Introduction of zombies and even more weaponry is fun  but lack of original's freedom feels like a step back.Also what other game gets a DLC 11 years after first release? And the shop at the mall that actually opened in 2016 is one of the funniest easter eggs up to date.I've been through Postal.I regret nothing."

Many of the classics were stomped by suit'n'tie men and women: Quake, Doom, GTA... but one game was known for being the most violent, depraved, senseless depiction of lunacy - POSTAL.First one was isometric shooter and it introduced us to the concept of senseless violence. We've needed to kill everyone and everything to pass the level. Killing was mandatory, and those enemies were no aliens or demonic creatures - they were all (mostly) innocent humans.POSTAL 2 arrived sometimes around 2002 or 2003, can't really tell, and it brought the violence into a 3D world. The game went FPS and Postal Dude fans went nuts about it.Considering that today we have more violent games people play and no one gets mad and there are basically no more politicians, senates, governments and parents deeply worried about what their children play, Postal 2 still stands out as a prime example of total, senseless violence. This game is still 0% politically correct, madness-driven insult toward everyone and everything. It plays nicely on cliches, prejudices and morals - it doesn't give a flying ♥♥♥♥ about religions, races, social, economic or sexual orientations - it's against everyone and everything.But is it a good shooter? No, it is not. It is full of glitches, bugs and the reason why it stills stands the test of time is the amount of insults its dispersing every time you launch it. If you're a grouchy intellectual, you might find the whole thing tiring and repetitive, but putting people on fire,♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥on their corpses or in their mouths until the point they vomit, using cats as silencers, chopping off heads with a shovel is still pretty fun, if you're open-minded, clever person knowing it's all bad humor.

Postal 2 is a game that panders to nobody, makes no effort to disguise its crude, satirical humor, and makes every effort to be as violent, repulsive, and entertaining as you want to make it.If I had to describe Postal 2 in two words, they'd be ""consciously repugnant"". That might sound fantastic, and it might sound terrible; it all depends on who you are, of course. Now, before you form your opinion, allow me to describe this in a little more detail:This day in age, Postal 2 is not an outstandingly controversial and/or offensive game, so there's little discussion to be had there. For the squeemish and easily offended, however, this certainly isn't the game for you. Postal 2 is a notably violent and innovatively disgusting game, so much so that it gives the game a certain, revolting charm.If you find that you are not easily offended, nor easily deterred by obscenity, violence, or the somehow comical use of urination, then you should strongly consider playing this game.

The graphics for 2003 are spectacular, the soundtrack are enjoyable, the atmosphere varies from outside to buildings and houses in the city called Paradise, AZ (in the USA). The gameplay is an open-world type, having the ability to do whatever you want, such as walking through the town, killing civilians/gangsters/police, beating animals, urinating on anything you want, a pretty rebel gameplay. The story is aboutThe Postal Dudewhich just moved to Paradise, AZ with his wife, and his dog, Champ. He will have to go through 7 days (from Monday to Sunday) where he will have to accomplish many risky takes, which mostly have unwanted consequences. The engines are well optimized, very rare crashes, and generally good engines.GraphicsThe graphics are spectacular for the year 2003, being a huge improvement over the first POSTAL game, by bringing the three dimensions feature and brining in the First-Person and the Third-Person. This game can be run even on low performance computers, which would still be able to run this game on Medium-High. The sky is mostly blue-yellowish, nights are very rare in this game, the cars, the guns, the buildings, and the nature things are well designed. Humans are being randomly deployed, being pretty well designed too. The buildings and houses are also well designed, giving more reality to Paradise.AtmosphereThe atmosphere varies from being outside to the ability to walk in every single building or house of this game, being a huge advantage for explorers. We may also see desert, because it’s located in Arizona. In the south of the town we may see higher altitudes, which also contain some forests. The game mostly happens during the daytime, very rare during the night time. We may see people everywhere, even animals, cats can be attached on shotguns, which seems pretty funny. There are many places to visit, also the DLC expands the areas even more (underground areas and even a new Paradise, a terrorized one. The population is very scared due to the atomic explosion which happened years back then.Audio/MusicThe soundtrack of this game were composed by RWS, proving that the developer has truly put effort in making a completely original game. During fights, we may hear some dynamic soundtracks, which encourages you to fight even better. While doing missions or just exploring the city, no soundtracks will play. We may hear birds singing, people talking, and sometimes the wind. We may also hear animals, such as dogs chasing cats, etc. The sound of the bullets are pretty alright, the voice acting is also very nice, especially forThe Postal Dude.GameplayThe gameplay is aboutThe Postal Dudewho does many tasks for his wife, such as buying milk, returning an overdue library book, getting Gary Coleman’s autograph, etc. This game is Open-World too, you may walk everywhere, and you can do what you want, anytime. You can even buy pizzas, donuts, drinks, etc. Also, there are some vending machines which sell heal kits, drugs (for health), etc.  (the health vending machine) and guns, grenades, vests, etc. (the weapons vending machine).  You can also talk with people (only the ones which have connections with missions). Overall good gameplay.StoryThe story Is aboutThe Postal Dudewhich just moved in Paradise, AZ with his wife and his dog, Champ. He has to go through many adventures, among tasks given by his wife.  He needs to buy milk, steak pay his debts, return overdue books, and pretty much everything about violence/killing. After Friday, his wife will shot him in the head, causing him a tumor. In the next 2 days, he will make his way out of Paradise. In the new DLC,The Postal Dudecame back In Paradise, but most of the town was already terrorized by the past atomic bomb, detonated byThe Postal Dudehimself. He will have to deal with many nations, such as Arabs, the Coleman family, etc.  The difficulties are way too many, nobody would need to choose from that many.EnginesThe engines on this game are well optimized, almost no crashes or bugs. The people's movements are pretty good, starting from walking calm through the town to running due to being alerted. The sky does not move, but in the DLC we may find snowing. In the cities there are cars which stand on the edge of the road or in garages, however, none of them is ever moving. When you shoot down somebody to death, I feel like their falling is not realistic. They just simply fall, not like in reality.  Also, I did not like how the sand is behaving. Instead of flowing in the air, it simply stays on the ground. This game can be played even on low performance computers, which give it a huge advantage.Other FeaturesThe multiplayer is pretty nice, it has some awesome maps and modes. However, it’s not alive anymore, making it pretty useless. If you have some friends who play it as well, play with them, you won’t regret your decision. The user interface is well-designed, being detailed with some blood additions, making it perfect for this type of violent games. The controls are well-chosen, which are a little complex, but you will have an easy time learning them. Some of the controls are displayed in the top-left screen. The mechanics are pretty nice, even though you get stuck in random objects sometimes, they are still pretty well-optimized. Everything around the city moves well. Overall, it’s a really enjoyable violent and dark-humor game.Positive PointsWell-designed graphics for 2003Almost no bugs or crashesNice audio and musicAwesome voice actingPretty Well-optimizedGood and coordinated AIA big city to exploreA great sense of dark humorMany weapons to choose fromAn open-world gameLong storylineMuch Steam Workshop contentGood and long DLCNeutral PointsToo many difficulties to choose fromThe multiplayer is not alive anymoreBeing able to drive cars would be greatNegative PointsFrequent loading zonesYou get stuck in random objects sometimesThe multiplayer is not so alive anymore"

It's an errand objective based game spanning across 7 days in where you do a different set of errands in (mostly) any order each day. Errands, which go incredibly wrong most of the time, and involve very much violence.The game has an inventory system of sorts with pretty much no limit except for ammocounts, items include things such as: Healing items ranging from a simple doughnut, to an overpowered health capping drug, as well as catnip which can be used as a bullet time drug, and cats which can literally be used as shotgun silencers. There's also healthkits you can pickup and use immediately, but not carry around in your inventory. The Postal Dude would rather carry an armada of cats and enough fastfood to kill America, but not something sensible like healthkits. Absolutely no complaints here.This has something in common with Shadow Warrior and the Jedi Knight Star Wars games, in that they both have firearms and a really awesome melee weapon(s) you use all the time because it's more effective and more fun, and tons more of decapitations.There's tons of melee weapons, guns, and things to set on fire.

I couldn't be any happier when this happened.The game's feel and engine is somewhere between Half-Life and Deus Ex and something else. Old crunchy feel to the levels (but not quite that old), and the silly movement bob when you move. Except Postal Dude can take seemingly even more damage than Gordon Freeman himself. All those years of drug abuse must have weaved some sort of kevlar equivalent into his skin or something.Also, at one point, the developers amazingly decided to release an expansion for this game 10+ years after it came out, kind of like how Age of Empires II got new DLC itself. Still can't believe either of those happened.Game kind of runs like trash at times, especially when too many NPCs are thinking, like fighting things and just generally freaking out.

In this game you control the Postal Dude, and you live as him in one ""normal"" week of his life. You have to do some work, like getting milk and easy things, getting Gary Coleman autograph. What could go wrong? The game is very funny, have a great gameplay and even a good time of campaign. It includes too the Apocalypse Weekend DLC, so, zombies and more playtime. The game graphics are outdated of course but are ok. The game contains a lot of bugs, they are funny but some are game breaking at some times, and the Apocalypse Weekend is very boring. Voice-acting is a funny thing: Postal Dude have an amazing one but the other characters suck. The game also have a soundtrack that have some cool musics sometimes but the game almost have no music.

Postal Dude lives in a trailer park in the small town of Paradise, Arizona, with his nagging wife, who is identified in the credits as simply, the 'Postal Dude's ♥♥♥♥♥'. The game's levels are split into days of the week starting Monday and finishing Friday.At the beginning of each day, Postal Dude is given several tasks to accomplish, such as 'get milk', 'confess sins', and other seemingly mundane tasks. The object of Postal 2 is to finish all of the tasks throughout the week, and the player can accomplish these tasks in any way he or she wishes, be it as peaceful and civilly as possible, or as violent and chaotically as possible. It is possible, if occasionally difficult, to complete most tasks without engaging in battle, or at least, harming or killing other characters, as evidenced by the game's tagline: ""Remember, it's only as violent as you are!"". The daily tasks can be accomplished in any order the player desires, and the game also includes one task that is activated only when Postal Dude urinates, in which the player is tasked with getting treatment for gonorrhea after Postal Dude discovers he has the infection.Throughout the course of the game, Postal Dude must put up with being provoked by other characters on a regular basis. He is given the finger, mugged, attacked by various groups of protesters, and is harassed by an obnoxious convenience store owner/terrorist and his patrons who cut before Postal Dude in the ""money line"". During the game, Postal Dude also encounters a marching band, a murderous toy mascot named Krotchy, the Paradise Police Department and its SWAT team, overzealous BATFE agents, the Arizona Army National Guard, an eccentric religious cult, cannibalistic butcher shop workers, fanatical Al-Qaeda terrorists, and former child actor Gary Coleman, among many others.By Friday afternoon, the final day in the game, the apocalypse occurs and societal collapse soon follows, with all law and order breaking down. Cats begin to fall out of a darkly-colored sky, and almost everyone in town becomes heavily armed, with random gun battles breaking out in the streets. Despite this, Postal Dude returns home to his trailer as normal, where he then gets into an argument with his wife, who demands that Postal Dude explain why he never picked up the ice cream she asked for at the beginning of the game. Postal 2 then ends with a gunshot being heard, before being kicked to the end credits."

The developers of this game were not afraid to go out there and it's very clear that this game was thoroughly thought out, made with love, and most importantly, made for the player.You're a random guy who tries to go about his day and finish some errands. Each errand can be completed in a number of ways, just one of the things that increase the replay value of this game. You can choose to live through the game as a good guy, doing the errands the ""right"" way, paying your bills, respecting civilians, etc. Or you can be a bad guy and kill anyone you see, steal anything you want, break stuff, etc.Then there is the amount of things you can do. It's almost endless; You can pee on people, you can pour gasoline on them and light them on fire, you can kick them, cut their heads off and play fetch with your dog (oh yeah, you have a dog, and you can get more dogs by giving them dog treats), taze them, sick your dog after them and so many more.The interactivity. The AI is pretty smart. Some will hide, some will run, some won't even be afraid of you, some will attack. They all react exactly how you think they would when being chased by your dog or set on fire or♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥on or shot at. They are even aware of the minor details in the world such as sound, doors, cats, dogs and eachother. If something in the world can't be destroyed, then it can be pushed around. Ragdolls also have amusing and sometimes funny results as usual.This game has the mentality of ""it's your game, play it how you want to"". You don't have to do the errands in order, you don't have to do them right away and there's many things to do besides the errands, but that's for you to discover. If you are one who goes for achievements, this game will certainly provide you with achievements that will take you for a fun ride, and some are not so easy. Like I said, there is no proper way to describe the gloryness of the game, you just have to play it.I highly recommend this game. 10/10."

The fact that the developers constantly update the game even to this day (the dismemberment feature was originally only in Apocalypse Weekend, and there were a lot fewer weapons in the original release) is astounding.

I like TV shows such asArcheror films such as the brilliantTeam America.Probably the most obvious comparison to this game,South Parkhas always seemed to be more of a hit and miss whenever I've found myself watching it.So having heard a reasonable amount about the POSTAL series over the years, I was mildly interested and picked this up for a dirt cheap price the other day during yet another Steam sale. After playing it for a bit, I was disappointed.Quite simply, I don't findPOSTAL 2funny, or even interesting, to play.I understand what it is trying to do, as well as the appeal and success of the game. But controversy for controversy's sake is a huge error when it comes to this kind of humor. Gameplay itself is nothing more than average for the mid-2000s period and I doubt you're here for graphical fidelity. Placing my own thoughts aside though, hats off to RWS for having the balls to continue to release and support the series.. it's a good thing that the gaming industry has this kind of thing, even if it doesn't work for me personally.But chances are you'll still enjoy it, so if you're in the mood, ignore my review and by all means, enjoy.It's not a ""bad"" game.

,Recommended,223470,11771397,"Posted: 18 August, 2014",all,★ Mr Trillson ★,"Myopinionatedbreakdown review of:POSTAL 2Gameplay: POSTAL 2 is set in a small town in Arizona named Paradise. You will play as Postal Dude (actual name) completing various day to day activities such as: getting milk, getting autographs from Gary Coleman, retrieving mail, and many other trivial activities that end up turning into an all-out gore fest. You see, this game doesn't care. Anything offensive you can think of, it'll probably be in this game. This game is a sandbox set in first-person based off of the Unreal engine. When you first start playing you will notice how open-ended and interactive the world is. Some sections are cut-off due to plot restrictions but usually, you won't get bored of one area. The combat is fairly dumb, but fun. The game's idea of difficulty is more enemies, and as you progress, you will become rivals with many factions. If I had to describe this game in two words, I would say ""Murder Simulator."" There are many weapons to utilize each with unique effects. Simple things such has scissors can be used as a lethal ninja star immitation. The game is very creative with how you want to kill or torture people (urinating on someone until he/she throws up). Play the game for it's killing, not the story.Art: The game manages to look decent, even by today's standards. There are a lot of copy and paste areas, but each section of the map feels unique enough to grab your attention. You will mostly be looking at blood, vomit, urine, and more blood.Music/sound: The game does little in the music department, other than atmospheric radio. The sound design is decent, most weapons sound like you would expect them to and the screams and remarks of bystanders add to the joy of murdering for no reason.Entertainment Value: The game is short. It would not be uncommon to beat this game in one day (if you did nothing but missions) but based off of the interaction, humor, violence, mature themes, and freedom the game presents, I can see a player coming back to it again and again if they want to murder and pee on people for no reason for some time. It isn't exactly and in-depth game.Score: Based on everything, the game offers nothing but a good murder simulation. The story is lackluster, the sound and art is decent, and the overall missions just consist of go to location, kill everything, leave. For what it's worth, the workshop support does add to the gameplay by giving you new weapons and maps, but at the end of the day, it is a very well done murder sandbox with extremely controversial subjects and content. Play at your own risk.3/5Thank youfor reading."

There are a few minor glitches here and there, but I'm sure the devs will get working on those asap. The weapons are a bit repetitive as so far I've only been able to use a shovel, pistol, machine gun, and a shotgun. Not sure what the rest of the game holds though.

It also surprised me in other ways, too, all in good ways.I love this game so much, and I have so much to say about it, but I'll try not to make this too long.I remember playing the demo back in around 2006, and all I knew about the game was that is was violent, gross, and controversial. Luckily, that stuff appealed to me. The game delivered on those points, but also in ways and levels I didn't expect. I didn't expect you to be able to urinate at will, on wherever (or whoever) you want. You can decapitate people with a shovel, and kick their heads around. Blood and vomit have a pretty advanced fluid system.I got the full version years later, and I had even more of a blast. A simple way of putting it is that this game puts you in an open world, with chores to do that almost always become more complicated. Luckily, you have a wide range of actions and weapons.Another thing I really like about this game is the atmosphere. There's ambient noises, like buzzing generators, wind, or even creepy supernatural-sounding droning in some parts, that can definitely feel a bit unsettling; fitting for a game like this.The humor is done really well, too. While a lot of it is gross-out and dark, it's done in ingenious ways. For example, a toilet shop has dripping toilets hung on chains from the ceiling. Pretty simple concept, but a hilariously gross way for the shop to advertise its products.The protagonist, known as The Postal Dude, fits well into the game's setting. He's got an adaptable personality based on how violent you are, but he retains a darkly humorous outlook. Rick Hunter did great voicing him. I also like the Postal Dude's alien shirt.My only big gripe about this game is that it can crash a little too often; too many dismembered limbs in a level tend to do this the most, especially if there's a lot of explosions or you like cutting people's limbs off with shears.-------The very short version of what I just said is: Open-ended violent, darkly humorous game with many weapons, great atmosphere that can be a little freaky, cool protagonist. Just beware of game crashes.It's amazing what RWS did with what they had. I assume they had a pretty low budget, resulting in somewhat low-detail graphics and animations. Despite that, they were able to pull off what I just mentioned, and so much more.If you don't mind the subject matter, check this game out.You know what?

A neat thing is that you can beat the game non-violently, I did.My biggest complaint with the game is that the Apocalypse Weekend expansion sucks♥♥♥♥♥♥ It's a really medicore corridor shooter at best and terrible one at worst and it ends with an absolutely boring boss fight that drags on way too long.

The game is of course offensive, but it's very funny, and even though on the surface it may appear to be offensive for shock value,  there are actually messages and commentary behind the very offensive stuff (for the most part.) Postal 2 is funny, however, for more than scripted scenes; the random shenanigans that can happen in the open world can be quite amusing and fun to watch, especially doing something like kicking someone, having them pull a gun on you, then have them (and possibly the whole town) get into a fire-fight with the police.The story in Postal obviously isn't the important part, it's simply a big fetch quest around the town of paradise, however it's not hard get lost on the way there, as it's easy to get caught up in the fun of slaughtering people. The game has a wide selection of weapons, which makes attacking random civs and police interesting. Some weapons such as the pistol, baton, shotgun, and assult rifle are common, while some are area specific, rare, and for the most part more interesting. You can get an axe to hack at peoples limbs. If they survive a hit to the arm, they run around screaming until you finish them. Or how about a can of gasoline, to light anyone you want on fire? Burning someone causes them to run around in circles, igniting anyone or anything they touch, eventually (unless killed or extinguished first) they collapse in a pile of searing charred flesh, barely clinging to life, free to be kicked to death as you please. But the best weapon in the game is one you start with: urine. The ability to♥♥♥♥♥♥on people, believe it or not, is one of the most powerful weapos, as it causes people to stop what they're doing and rub their face. Or, if you get lucky, they might puke and completely stand still for 5 seconds or so, leaving you plenty of time to kill them. Postal's gore is awesome, and with so many varied ways to kill (My favorite is hacking all of someone's limbs off, burning them to a crisp, then as they beg for you to end it, kick them until they explode) you never feel bored travelling between areas. Definetly ignore whatever stupid 0/10 reviews you see, this game is awesome! Oh, and it's still getting updates, which means you can bet on even more cool content coming."

,Recommended,223470,24603622,"Posted: 29 July, 2016",all,King Link,"Another game that would really benefit from a ""mixed"" recommendation.This is a hard game to rate, because it's based on the player more than the game.  But there is a game behind it that needs to be reviewed.So the game is an old 13 year old game (released in 2003 so the future people have the actual time scale).   When Postal was popular with the mass murdering gameplay, Running With Scisssors worked on a sequel, and took their time, 6 years later, Postal 2 came out, and it's certainly different.3d graphics versus an isometric game, story instead of random murder, and actually a very different tone as well.The problem is similar to other games it hasn't aged amazing.  13 year old 3d technology is quite interesting to see.  At the same time, Postal 2 is unlike any other game, and that's both a positive and a negative.Postal 2 tries very hard to be edgy, but it does so in a way that definitely makes it almost a time capsule.  Putting muslim suicide bombers in the game in 2003, was extremely tasteless, now... Not as much?   Osama Bin Laden's name is in the game, is that edgy any more?   Shooting bullets through cats (in oddly enough not as tasteless a way as someone would do now)I think a majority of the humor of the game has actually fallen away.   I mean there's a voting joke and it's referencing the 2000 election... It's actually a little funny, but that's one kind of humor you're going to get.   The other?  Well there's a way to pee on, anyone you want.   You have a very juvenile humor in this game, and yet it kind of works on some level.The thing is the entire game tries VERY hard to be edgy, so if you can be offended, you will be.  Almost every woman is big breasted, and I don't mean 'there's a lot of Buxom characters'.  No, there's like ONE female player model and it's a big breasted woman, there's two males that I noticed, a skinny and a fat guy.   If that's going to offend you you're going to get♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥  The only Muslims in the game are the terrorists/taliban who will attack you on sight, if you're going to be offended, you'll have a problem.  The list goes on.   If you can get offended, this game will try to find that button.But overall, I mean it's insults from 2003, that kind of don't hit any more.  I don't know, I can't really be offended by it, because it's made to offend, not because it's an honest opinion expressing itself.There is a bit of cognitive dissonance when you get to the trophies as they were added recently.   There's numerous references to both the League and It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia as well as other recent pop culture in the trophies.  It's actually a weird touch, but you know what?  It kind of helps.As for the technical parts of the game, the majority of the game works perfectly, with the exception of the sound.  Ugh, the sound.  I'm going to guess this was the beginning of 3d sound technology, and maybe something's changed since then, but the main character speaks VERY loud, and every other important character is near impossible to hear.  A shame.I could go into more, but honestly.  If you want to see what got a lot of people's panties in a bunch in 2003 this is a perfect game for that.  It's not an amazing game, it's not going to blow you away.  This isn't going down in the hall of fame of gaming (except for its attempt at offensiveness) but I've played a lot of worse games, and Postal 2 seems to understand it's not a top tier game and has priced themselves at a realistic number.Overall there's a game that works well (though I did see a few crashes).  It's both incredibly playable and interactive.  It actually has a lot of choice involved in it (you can beat the game without killing anyone or ignore the story and go on a murder rampage, the game allows both options).  And with the exception of the sound issue that was an annoyance, it's still a solid game.If you're unsure, I would probably not recommend the game, but for what it is, it's a positive gaming experience.  Just be sure you know what you're getting into and aren't going to get offended by 13 year old jokes (that are probably also aimed at 13 year olds)"

In fact, you'll end up raiding the whole city as you are trying to reach a certain location just because you can.Every day you get a few errands to complete and multiple ways to do so. Unlike other games, the errands seem to be very simple, some tasks that anyone could face- buying milk, paying a ticket at the police station, get steaks- nothing could go wrong.The game is as violent as you are, you can either gopostaland kill your way out of anything, or try to peacefully make your way out of trouble without getting killed (that's the real challenge).There are tons of secrets hidden by the map designers that contain either easter eggs and/or hidden weapons and items that will help you as you progress trough the game.Aside from the fun gameplay, badass one-liners and humorous jokes, the game is not entirely flawless. One of the most stressing features is the loading zones, meaning that whenever you will go around a corner or trough a tunnel you will most likely face a loading screen. The wait time isn't that long, usually taking ~10 seconds, but for a game where traveling is a key feature it starts to get on your nerves pretty quickly. Another flaw is the not-so-great hit reg system, which will cause weapons such as the m4 and m5 to be nearly useless at times, but with an old engine like p2 is running on, the game itself can't be blamed for these.However, unless you're an actual fan of old games that is used to such issues games used to have, you should probably stay away from it.

Naturally I've been a fan of this awesome game ever since it came out. Free roam and do whatever you want in it. Try not to play the game. I mean just try to NOT go and try to get that milk or check or errand done. If you do try and do an errand you might as well kiss your ♥♥♥ goodbye to being a nonviolent person. Huuuuummmmmooooouuuuurrrrrrr ! I mean id rather make a woman with a boob as a weapon mod sometimes with this game. I mean that is my next mod idea that i want to make for this game ! It just sounds so slapping funny ! I've played this game so much through these years that i even made some mods/levels/errands for this game too recently ! I have not done that with any game on steam yet except this one ! That is because this game is the best on steam !

There are so many features in this game that can strike awe, shock, joy and disgust within the hearts of so many people. It's the one game I will possibly always play. It's been around for about a decade, so there are some limits within the gameplay that can be distractive; Such as loading zones and the character and npc models (you can see their heads being detachable behind their necks.) but personally I'm indifferent to those negative sides. I reccomend this to anyone who likes FPS games, no exceptions (Besides those who regard a game's release date as what makes it good.)"

,Recommended,223470,8741426,"Posted: 17 January, 2014",all,Bit Bandit ツ,"Postal 2 is one of those games, sick, tasteless, and certainly not afraid to offend people. Postal 2 will definatly be considered a guilty pleasure by many players who enjoy the game. Postal 2 is a PC only game first released in April of 2003 and was developed by Running with Scissors. In Postal 2 you play as the Postal dude, a guy who lives in a caravan with his wife in a city known ironically enough as ""Paradise"", that's really it as far as story goes, it's pratically non-existant.The game is divided up into 7 days; monday, tuesday, wednesday, thursday, friday, saturday and Sunday. In each day your objectives are to perform menial tasks such as buying milk, paying your speeding fine, all that kind of stuff. What makes each day interesting though, is that you have the freedom to go through these objectives as you see fit, do you try go through the game not laying harm upon an NPC? Or do you go Postal and kill everyone in your way, or kill as many people as you see fit.If you do go the POSTAL route, there is a large varity of weapons ranging from shovels and mechetes, to M16 rifles and Remington shotguns, Jerry cans and stun guns, hunting rifles and Napalm launchers, the list goes on. If you are unsatisfied of the look of the M4 Carbines and/or Remington shotguns, you can always decorate them by putting a cat silencer onto the barrel.At the end of most menial tasks something can go horribly wrong, such as while confessing your sins at a church, the church will be attacked by terrorists, and you gotta escape avoiding all the enemies, or kill all of them. I gotta say, the hit detection of most of the weapons are sometimes pretty hit-n-miss, for example using the shotgun isn't always an instant kill upon headshot, even at the closest range possible, the same case applys to the hunting rifle, although this issue never became too big or annoying enough to make me quit the game or yell in anger.If you get caught by the police doing things you shouldn't you'll gain a wanted level and you gotta hide to reduce it until it runs out and you're free to roam about again, unless you get arrested in which case you gotta escape from prison, the cool part is that the wanted system also applies to NPCS, so watching other NPCS going postal never gets old.Speaking of a wanted system you can also find a policeman's uniform and become a cop and perform all the crimes you want that aren't against cops.Oh yeah you can pee in this game, I'm not joking, at any moment you can press the R key and start♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥on things as much as you please, and if you forget to zip up your pants NPCS will remark at it saying things like ""No one's impressed"", ""I've seen bigger"", and ""Hey! Mr Peepshow! Put your hands in the air!"".Also, I gotta mention the impressive fire system, when you got a Jerry Can, you can pour gasoline and pour pools of the stuff and ignite it when ready, when NPCS walk in the fire, they will often run at other NPCS which will set them on fire, until they turn into a burnt corpse holding on to their life.I gotta say though, the voice acting apart from the Postal dude is just horrendous, all the NPCS sound like they have the same voice just with a different pitch and often talk like this; ""Hi, That'll be. 400. Bucks."". The Postal dude, while has some bad lines, still makes up for it by having a sort of personality with many lines, such as ""Somebody stole my donut! now you're all gonna pay!"".The A.I. is also pretty bad, regularly forgetting to shoot their gun at me and getting in the way a lot.The world itself is very open and you can go anywhere as you see fit as long as the game lets you because some areas are inaccessable until a day such as friday or wednesday, if you're out of money and you don't feel like getting it the legal way, you can always head to the Paradise Bank and go inside the vault and empty it out stealing hundreds of $. You pretty much can do whatever you want at anypoint of the game. Also, 90% of buildings in Postal 2 you can enter, so if you feel like it, you can go around and literally kick open most doors in the game, or if you're too cool to go through the door you can always kick through the windows. Since the world is so open, it encourages a lot of exploration, which rewards explorers with weapons, items, and some secret areas.Soundwise, there isn't really any music in the game aside from some ambiance inside of a store, all the weapons got a nice ring to them, and the voice acting is again terrible.Graphically, the game for it's time looked ""okay"", by today's standards it definatly look's dated but never really subtracted the experience for me.Also Garry Coleman is in this game, no seriously check it out.Overall, I can't say I can recommend this game to everybody, I mean I've enjoyed it a large amount and I'm glad it focuses more on fun rather than fancy graphics or voice acting, but much of the humor is usually about toilet humor, homosexuals, rednecks, Arab-Terrorists, some sterotypes, animal cruelty that kind of stuff. I mean hell this game is known as one of the most offensive games to come out for a reason which caused it to get outright banned in countries such as Australia and New Zealand. Althought if you can get by the of childish humor, I'm sure you might have a blast with the game, I know I did.Did I mention Uwe Boll made a movie about this game?Postal 2 sure defines the term ""Guilty Pleasure""7/10"

The game may market and structure itself as ""bad or stupid"", but it is definitely talented and smart in executing that.Sure, it's a stupid game.

You can complete the tasks in this game mostly any way you see fit.  If you want to do it violently and kill everybody, go right ahead.  No one's stopping you...except for maybe the game's NPC's, that is, but that's their problem, not yours.  But if you wanna do it legitimately and by the book and not hurt a hair on anybody's head...do it that way.  If you really want to.  You sissy.  :p  You can also carry out said tasks in any order you want.  As long as all of them are done at the end of the day, you can move on to the next one.  If you don't feel like completing the tasks, then don't complete them.  However, you will be locked at the first day and you won't see all that the game has to offer if you stay there.  So you should try to do your chores. c:If you do choose to be violent in this game, know that you have a big, big selection of weapons at your disposal.  Ballistic weapons, blunt weapons, edged weapons, explosive weapons, fire weapons, biological weapons...there's a LOT to kill your victims with in this game.  You can even use your...er, ding-a-ling as a weapon.  Yeah, you heard me.  You can expose yourself and pee on everything.  Even the populace.  And it is GREAT.  Besides the weapons, there are also lots of supplementary items in this game.  Everything from dog biscuits (which you can use to befriend dogs, obviously) to crack pipes (which give you lots of health but carry the drawback of addiction).  And if you take the time to explore the large, sprawling areas in this game, all of this and then some will be yours.But the definite highlight of this game is the humor.  Oh God, the humor.  It's terribly offensive and excessively raunchy, but I kinda like it.  There were a lot of moments in this game that got a genuine laugh out of me.  The very adult humor in this game is on a self-aware level, but it also knows that people are genuinely offended by it, yet it also knows the other half of the audience that appreciates this level of humor.  To an extent, I appreciate unapologetic humor where no sh*ts are given.  I'm not sure if that makes me a terrible person, but I do love humor that knows what it is and doesn't take itself seriously at all.Did I mention this game has enormous mod support?  Just be aware that you can't earn achievements while playing a modded game...Okay, now let's get to the bad stuff about this game.  But don't let that stop you from buying this, please.  Postal II is an old game.  It's 12 years old at the time of this review.  So what that means is that this is a game running on Unreal Engine 2 in an age where games run on Unreal Engine 4.  This game is using an engine made in 2002.  So expect very dated graphics and sound.  But you know what?  Graphics and sound don't make a game.  They never did.  I should also mention that loading screens are very common in this game, but on today's systems, they only take a few seconds to pass.  Hit detection in this game is also pretty bad, meaning, for example, if you shoot someone in the head with a pistol, it will not kill them for some reason.  However, if you use a SCOPED shot from a hunting rifle or a point-blank shot with a shotgun, it will.  Weird.  That baffled me for all the 12 years this game was out and it STILL was not rectified.  Another thing I should note is that even though there are cars in this game, you CANNOT drive them.  Walking is your only means of conveyance.  You will be walking in this game.  A LOT.  I guess the Postal Dude is just too cool to drive everywhere.  One last bad thing I should mention is that this game crashes quite a bit depending on what your hardware setup is like.  I experienced crashes to desktop whenever I chopped up too many people with edged weapons, which seems to be a common issue for others.That's pretty much all of the bad stuff, though.  Again, don't let any of that keep you from adding this phenomenal game to your library.  It's a classic and it's always being updated.  Buy it today!  When you get to Paradise, tell the Dude Twiggy sent ya! ^_^"

Luckily it is small, so a transfer to an SSD takes care of this effect qutie nicely. If you aren't easily offended, and in fact enjoy vulgarity, pick this up and enjoy.

It's what you would expect from a FPS game but at the same time, there are parts of it that I enjoyed more than anything else I've played in a long time. There are still some bugs within the game, despite being out for such a long time. One such bug I encountered was that I cut off both legs from an NPC, she got up and started to run away on invisible legs. If you go to jail, you lose everything; your guns, money, food, anything that's not your matches since you need that to break out of jail. Also, if you catch on fire, pee on yourself to put yourself out. It's not much of a sandbox although you can treat it as one if you disregard the mission that you are currently on sometimes. Other times, the mission does not allow you to freely roam and you must stick to the mission in question. All in all, I do recommend this game.This game truly entertained me for quite a while as I ran around the maps throwing my machete and waiting for it to boomerang back to me. Not only that, I loved going on a rampage and killing everyone with my insane weapons. You could say the same for GTA and Saints Row games but there's just something about peeing on someone, watching them throw up out of disgust, then kicking them until they die.Another entertaining thing to do: throwing a sledgehammer at the♥♥♥♥♥of a cow.

Postal 2 completely blows it's nose with the first game and it's story and starts something hilarious. While Postal was about the dude going on a city wide killing spree featuring dark psychotic tones, the sequel is the dude just trying to live out a week in his city while dealing with a completely exaggerated but hilarious enviroment. The levels are broken up into days of the week and it's semi free roam, meaning you can go where you want but certain areas don't open up until a later day. The game, at first on the easier difficulties, really is as violent as you are until your forced to deal with one of the many hate groups you encounter over the week.

One week in his small town with the general daily tasks such as picking up the hard-earned wages or buying milk or taking back the book to the library. But something always happens: when you go to the church to confess your sins, for example, Arab terrorists attack. The game allows you to go wherever you want and whenever you want: essentially, it feels like a non-linear game. Once you reach your destination a cutscene takes place and you follow a linear path after which you are back in town free to go to the place you desire.The game looks horrendous but it is understandable as it is a more than 10-year old software.

The graphics may not be state of the art but you won't really care about them, you will be too busy murdering,dismembering (every limb pretty much) or urinating all over people.

,Recommended,223470,30319128,Posted: 4 March,all,BadassFreeman,"This is a weird game to make a review about. The game itself is kind of an oddity and if you can describe it as something, it sure as f#ck it would be ""complete offensive clusterf#ck"". That being said, it's satiric style does make it remarcably fun to play with from time to time, something I wasn't expecting at all. I met this game for the first time with a free demo a f#ckload of years ago and all I remember about it is shooting islamic people with a shotgun that had a cat as a silencer (by literally sticking the poor cat's #sshole on the gun's barrel) and then♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥on their corpses. It's that kind of game. As usual I will first talk about it's negative parts, then move up from there.First and foremost, it's biggest problem is the engine and it's gameplay. Saying that it hasn't aged well is putting it lightly. At times weapons just seem to not be worth a damn while NPC's seem to enjoy glitching around and doing one of the worst jobs at actually putting up a fight. There's also glitches, though you'll be glad to know that the Developers STILL try to fix anything gamebreaking that might happen, which is honestly impressive taking into account how f#cking old this game is already.The weapons themselves are a bit dumb. You see, to the end of the game you'll have so many that's just overwhelming at times to go through the damn menu and try to find the one you wanted to use. Specially melee weapons, 90% of them become instantly obsolete later on and they'll just be taking a space in your insanely big inventory. Then there's weapons that just don't have much of an use, like the rocket launcher or grenade launcher that I used around once or twice in the entire thing. Also, this game manages to make shotguns boring. HOW. HOW THE F#CK YOU DO THAT!? THE SHOTGUN IS AS WORTHLESS AS A SILENCER ON A NUKE.Something that's probably obvious by now is that the game is also quite violent and offensive. I know that will turn down a lot of people, so that's my warning. I'll say though, the first POSTAL game was WAAAAY more violent and it actually took itself more seriously, while this one is more of a satirical experience with tons of dumb jokes. You might get a laugh at this one at times mainly because of how insane most stuff is, but sure as hell when racist, sexist or homophobic stuff goes around it drops the ball too much, going from satirically hilarious to just going too far.I'm also not the biggest fan of how much damage you can take and how little there is on the way of healing. All of those food items you might find? Kinda worthless until you have around 50 of them. You better stock up on weed during the early game because it's pretty much what will keep you alive later on, even if it does have a negative side-effect.Lastly, I found the last parts of the game underwhelming compared with the crazy bullsh#t that was happening early. Honestly, it feels like some fans made up the end game based on some dude's fanfiction; it's close to what you would expect, but it's just not the same.Is the game good, though? In a cosmic sort of way, yes.You see, this is one of those games that are so ungodly f#cking bad that they're actually amazing. Pretty much EVERYTHING in the game is SO WRONG that it's good. Just think of Hatred, one of the edgiest games out there, actually done well. It manages to be fun for a long amount of time despire it's issues and that's not something you pull off easily.The game also gives you a ton of freedom on doing the main objectives however you feel like, which is something I honestly love. It does drop the ball with the freedom later on, but oh well. I'd also say that actually playing the game on a pacifistic respectful way is just as hilariously fun as the psycopathic trigger-happy one.The main character also has a pretty cool voice-actor behind him and I actually enjoyed his performance and ironic, sarcastic bullsh#t. Just think of a young Duke Nukem who had enough with planet Earth and feels like going on a rampage and it's nearly as fun as the actual Duke.The story itself is also cool enough for a game like this. Sure there isn't much, but I don't think this game needed more. It's simple, and it stays simple until said late-game stages were it kinda drops the ball.Do I recommend this game? It mainly drops down to your tolerance to over-the-top offensive♥♥♥♥♥♥ If you can handle those kind of things, then you'll find a game that's fun as hell for all the wrong reasons and that despite having sh#t FPS mechanics, it's still worth going through to the end. If you can't take a joke, turn back right now. I don't think this game is best suited for you.TL;DR Edition: One of the most offensive games you can find lately, which plays like out-of-date sh#t and it still manages to be fun. You should be wary of it's extremely offensive nature before you buy it, but once you do you'll find that the game is actually just satirical and poking fun at it. Maybe poking fun a bit too hard, but I'd still recommend it on a Steam sale if you can take a f#cking joke."

Finally decided to buy it and try for myself. I wasn't expecting much in terms of gameplay but am I in for a surprise. 10 years on and I have to say I haven't played a game this fun for a long while. Yes, it's very crude and sets out to offend, and production values are pretty low, but that's actually the point, and in fact where the wacky fun comes in. I don't play video games to be polictically correct!The very wide variety of weapons and items in an open world with plenty of NPC in-fighting allows for creative play which IMHO is unmatched by any game in recent history. The fact that you can wee on yourself to put out a flesh fire is unprecedented (and dare I say, unlikely to be replicated) in gaming history and reason enough to experience this game.They simply don't make games like this anymore.

Or do I smash their heads in and get things done however I see fit? Do I set them on fire then proceed to pee on them to extinguish the fire only to stab them repeatedly with a pair of scissors? Do I run and hope for the best or do I shove a shotgun barrel up a kittens sacred region as a make-shift silencer and take everyone out? These are but a few of the vast choices you will be making, and at the end of the day who said anyone had to die? It's all about completing the tasks, whichever way you see fit.While the regular Postal 2 gameplay is quite mellow, if you're looking for serious action (Resident Evil meets Silent Hill) from start till finish that will keep you on the edge of your seat and which resembles more of a quick-paced Half-Life run I'd thoroughly recommend the Apocalypse Weekend mode (after you've completed the main Monday-Friday run of course, to get into the swing of things as Postal 2 isn't your normal shooter and takes a bit of getting used to).All in all, for a game that was released in 2003 (over 10 years ago!) the constant updates (up until this very year, over 10 years later) have only improved the content tenfold, from better graphical support (widescreen now available!) to bug fixes and gameplay improvement you're guaranteed a smooth transition into what is certainly one of the best first person shooters around.

It's full of all the same mindless fun it was nearly a decade ago when it earned itself a spot right alongside Manhunt on the list of most violent video games to date. Trust me when I say this game is the best $2.49 you'll ever spend. (Or $10 if you don't manage to get it while it's on sale)My Rating: ★★★★✰ 4/5Ten years ago I would've given this game a 5/5 but since the humor is dated and it's riddled with technical errors and glitches it only gets a 4.

It's also one of the most bizarre and fun shooters I've played in years. I mean, what other game allows you to hurl diseased cow heads at terrorists, watch them vomit everywhere, then kick their dead bodies into other people to infect them as well? Not too many, I'd hope.Postal 2's plot is simple - you're the Postal Dude, and you have 3-4 chores you need to take care of each day. Things as simple as returning a library book and collecting your paycheck become insane challenges when certain crazed citizens of Paradise get involved by shooting up your workplace or burning down the library with you inside. The further into your week you go, the more difficult these tasks become. But, they're never too frustrating, as you never really can hit a point where it's impossible to complete a task. Just duck, weave, and snipe out enemies, and you'll be in the clear usually.The weapons of this game are just as crazy as its scenarios. In addition to the usual shotguns, assault rifles, and pistols, you get weapons like throwable scissors, scythes, sledgehammers, deodorant flamethrowers, and WMD's. They all shine in their own unique ways, and contribute to the surreal atmosphere of the game.While the Apocalypse Weekend expansion might be less enjoyable than the base game, the overall package is worth a play if you enjoyed the first five days of gameplay. I would highly recommend Postal 2 to shooter fans and avid gamers alike. It's just too oddball to pass up."

Postal 2's missions are simply the protagonist (""Postal Dude"") completing a number of menial and trivial tasks (picking up groceries, going to the Bank, etc.) while occasionally being pitted against various enemies (like protesters who believe video-games cause violence - only to whip out automatic rifles and begin indiscriminately murdering people, a group of Jihad leading an assault on a church, etc.) In regards to gameplay, unlike in GTA, you're placed in a relatively rural environment, and there's an odd complete absence of vehicles, except for those in parking - not even NPCs drive any vehicles. Most weapons are found through stealing or finding them, though there some of them are purchasable via the mall.In summary, if you happen to find this game for a good price (like I did, at $2), it's well worth the purchase for several hours of mindless indulgence."

,Recommended,223470,21263444,"Posted: 16 February, 2016",all,blim,"IN BRIEF: Postal 2 is a great game and a great commentary of what games are supposed to be. After nearly 160 hours of playtime, I'm still not done. The game's extremely short length is balanced by the excellent use of steam achievements, frequent updates since its 2012 re-release, and its bizarre DLC.----STORY: As silly as it is for me to write this, the story in Postal 2 is fairly subtle. Whether or not that is intentionally so is another issue altogether. You play as the Postal Dude getting his weekly chores done as the world around him gets more and more hostile and strange. It plays well into the themes of player choice and the motto: ""It's only as violent as you are"". The story however, is less about the Postal Dude himself and more about the developers' views on video games and political correctness (PC): Modern life is suddenly interrupted by suicide bombings in the post-9/11 world in which the game was released; videogame protestors are mocked as violent patrons of Joe Lieberman; The 1990’s intersection of appropriateness and coarse media are symbolized as crude children’s cartoons. Postal 2 is a recreation of Middle America caught between the 1990’s and the 21st century. The game’s commentary may be dated like its engine but timeless as history repeats itself and PC culture inevitably returns.THEMES: Postal 2 mocks PC culture, videogames, and itself. Protestors, and the average person, are displayed as idiotic zealots and perverted buffoons. Videogames are slighted and misunderstood and at the same time misogynistic and hostile. The game enjoys pointing when good intentions largely serve to carry out bad results. Even developers Vince Desi and Mike J are depicted as, well, hostile idiotic misogynistic perverted buffoons. Postal 2 takes nothing seriously, including its own prequel: In Postal, Dude is out to destroy the world but in Postal 2, the world is out to destroy him. The Naked Gun-style contrast of serious people in a ridiculous world gives the game its sense of levity and fun, even when it’s so gruesome.GAMEPLAY: It’s easy to label Postal 2 as a crude Grand Theft Auto clone. It’s easy to assume the violent gameplay will get old within a few minutes. That all depends on what you’re looking for in a game. Yes, you can kill a few minutes doing some very violent things, get bored and forget about the game for a few months. You can also appreciate the world the game creates by finding unique weapons, wreaking havoc, evading police, and finding Tora Bora and a hidden sewer system. It’s the little jokes and easter eggs where Postal 2 shines. While you do have to go looking for these things - and it’s not a point in the game’s favor for the player to put effort into fun - you’ll enjoy the game a lot more. Did you know you can rob the police station?As much as I recommend the game, and believe me, I do, the game does suffer a bit on Wednesday and Thursday. It seems the developers didn’t know how to raise the stakes, so they instead went ahead with basking in caricatures and obscene stereotypes. That said, the game picks back up to a satisfying finish on Friday. There is also no purpose for money in the game if the player takes the violent route. Apocalypse Weekend puts the player in a funnier, more ridiculous continuation of the world but suffers from the lack of open-world gameplay. The harder difficulties can be extremely frustrating, even for the experienced player, but the result is a more satisfying game and more consistently-raised stakes for the player (FYI, get the sawed-off shotgun on Thursday).STEAM ACHIEVEMENTS: Postal 2 should be the gold standard for what achievements should be. They highlight the easter eggs and features of the game (correcting some of the gameplay issues mentioned earlier), and give the gameplay massive replay value for playing on the harder difficulty settings. It’s a great way to get players invested and immerse into the game.DLC: Apocalypse Weekend (AW) comes standard with Postal 2. While AW is more experimental and funnier than Postal 2, its linear gameplay and difficulty may turn off some players. Paradise Lost (PL) is a separate purchase DLC that is pretty much a new game. While I plan to write a full review for Paradise Lost as well, PL has Postal 2's themes and open-world with AW's characters and more ridiculous post-apocalypse setting. Paradise Lost is the strongest of the three games.DEVELOPERS: Running With Scissors have put a lot of work into updating this game for Steam, and it’s comforting to know there are still developers out there that care about their customers and their product. Postal 2 has received several updates and bugfixes since its launch on Steam. Controller support was even added. However, the game still has bugs at times, especially crashes when using the Sawed-off shotgun too much. I hope they can address this and other lingering issues.STRONGLY RECOMMENDEDReview may be editted for future updates"

That's all I can say about this game, and that's all you need to know.Okay. I'll try and make a serious review here.""I can already tell this is going to be one of those days.""In the game, you control The Postal Dude, a guy who is the butt monkey of life in the city of Paradise (oh the irony).He lives in a rusty, broken down trailer on the back of someone's house. He has an awful wife. He loses his job just a day after he starts. His car doesn't work. He has to run some errands.Obviously, things will not go right.""Here I was, just minding my own business, enjoying my Second Amendment rights, and you people have to freak out on me!""Straight from the beggining, you are free to do as you please. The city is rather big, and packed full of secrets or events.The game is split into 7 days (originaly 5, untill Apocalypse weekend expansion was included) where you need to do several tasks; get some milk, get some people to sign your petition, get an autograph fromGary Colemanand so on.Unfortunately, Paradise is a very, VERYVERYbad place. Wanna go confess in church? Well, better get your♥♥♥♥♥♥moving, because as soon as you are done, terrorists will attack this place. Go to the bank so you can cash in your check? Robbery! Try to buy some milk? LONG QUEUES. Here, the game gives you 2 choices: be passive and run away, wait for your turn, kindly pay for the stuff you buy. Effective, risk free,boring.Or, you could just go POSTAL.*Taped laughter plays*""Hey, it's not my fault, book the kid with the keyboard!""Yes, sooner or later you'll find yourself fighting for whatever the reasons.Smacking with shovels, zapping with tasers, shooting guns, spilling gasoline, throwing machetes, sledgehammers and scissors, the list of your mostly improvised weaponry just keeps increasing. With all these tools of destruction, it's very hard to resist going nuts on the residents. Especialy when they keep calling you a ""freaking pinko"".Obviously, the police will try to stop you, and they are rather effective at their job, searching for you when you evade their patrols, and calling in reinforcements when things go south.The fights will end up very bloody and gory, as you can decapitate, chop off limbs and cleave people in half, burn them to a crisp, or electrocute them till they wet themselfs.But there is a lot more stuff to do than just cause chaos:Urinate on various things!Befriend some dogs!Visit the local Elephant ranch!Play a game in the arcade!Rob a store/bank/drug dealer!Raid a secret terrorist base!Use a cat as you silencer!...And much more!""All the cars in the town seem to be props anyway.""The game's weak point is the graphics. They're, well, ugly.The textures have low resolution, and the models tend to be very simple. You'll see many clones of the citizens, and the animations aren't so great either. While that aspect can be ignored, it is still present in game.What's also present? Glitches. Thankfully, the minor ones. Sometimes, my dog spawned in a wall, effectivly freezing him, The police managed to shoot me through the wall one time, and bigger physics objects can cause the people to leviatate when they smack into them.""Honey, you won't believe the day I've had!""While the storyline is remarked as bad,it is bad.As in ""bad"".Going through Monday to Friday (and later through the weekend) you'll visit many places and see new stuff happening, as the situation in the city gets worse and worse. Over the game, you'll make many enemies; Book haters, Rednecks, Butchers, Video game protestors, which will try to kill you if they see you.You'll also go from buying some milk, to giving a birthday gift to the town's resident leader of zealots. All while the building is being attacked by special forces.And then there's the game's specific sense of humor. You see, the devs know that the game is not the best, and it's very offensive, disgusting and just plain stupid and pointless.And they are sure to point that out.Cue many jokes towards ""violent video games"" and the people who protest them, The Dude calling you out if you utilise the quicksave button too much, or if you cheat, the store owner clearly works with the terrorists, during one of the days, you'll be made a gimp, and then in the graveyard you can find a tombstone of a Steam user, who died while collecting trading cards. You'll either die laughing, or chuckle out of pity.""I regret nothing.""In conclusion, POSTAL 2 is a very specific kind of game. It's as offensive as you make it, and while the graphics are not too great, it makes up with the pure, undiluted carnage that is the perfect way to have some fun and forget about your stresses.PROS:# Open world, ready to be slaughtered.# Doesn't take itself seriously.# Lasts a long time, and it's mod-friendly.# It gets as violent as you want it to be.CONS:# The graphics are horrible.# The humor might not be funny for all.# Same with the gore.# There are some minor glitches that happen frequently through the game."

This one is for YOU,The original game from 2003 - Postal 2 - based on the Unreal Engine is a satire-laced adventure into the open-world fps genre.  If you like to laugh, like to hunt for secrets (think Doom type secrets), enjoy trying to find 'others ways of doing things', or just wish to blow off steam while getting a good laugh - this game is entirely for you.  Do not hesitate.A few things you can do in this game:Kick or throw cats through a window or use them as a silencerLure cops with donuts (or dress up as one)Lure dogs with dog treats or bags of foodRob the bank (more than one way)Be a pacifist and don't hurt anyone who doesn't try to hurt you.Go on a murderous rampage with any number of over a dozen different weaponsPee on someone and make them barf (or shoot you, or run away)Douse a person or people in gas and well... you know the rest[enhanced game] Give cats catnip, and then pick them back up and then throw them onto someone and they become a taz-style dervish.  Catnip normally just attracts cats in the basic game, or you can smoke it!Find a Chris-Mess tree in July (in Arizona!) for your nagging wife[this next one is for all the guys involved in Operation Iraqi Freedom/Enduring Freedom]Find the secret taliban base and exterminate them and get the WMD!also....Roam around accomplishing nothing but exploration or mayhem ignoring all the mission objectivesBlow off a whole-lotta-steam from a hard days work with a good laugh...this is barely a comprehensive list... many many more things to do, I won't spoil it allBest of all - it runs on even the more basic computers available today!  You don't need an incredibly powerful gaming machine!Seriously - you'll want to try this one.The PARADIS LOST DLC:GET IT, if you enjoyed the base game, YOU MUST GET IT.  Higher res textures, more detailed level design (duh), new missions.  It's making up for all those years since the Apoc Weekend DLC game out.  So reasonably priced too!Running With Scissors, I cannot thank you enough.  This is awesome.  You don't know the redeeming quality that is massacre-ing a GINGER that loves Chris-Mess.  That aweful holiday rhumba got me in the mood for war quicker than anything!  Peeing on Gingers, Animal Abuse, Impersonating a cop, exploring the run-down mostly abandoned mall, and little monkeys with guns that are half-robot or something.  It's all just so awesome.You keep making DLC's,  I'll keep buying them.  GREAT WORK!  Oh, and if anyone reading this is Irish... no offense, I just happen to have one after me in real life who is trying to illegally track me.  Don't take it to heart unless you're that one person.   This is a well made game through and through, DLC and all, don't pass it up, especially if you have a sense of humor.

,Recommended,223470,15495566,"Posted: 22 April, 2015",all,Hans Brotmeister,"Postal 2 is an open world first person shooter. Calling it a first person shooter is at least the most fitting term for the game since although it features a lot of melee weapons and can even be finished without shooting at all - at least on lower difficulty settings. It is very different from the first Postal game which was a rather dark top down shooter that was broken  up into various levels where the sole objective was to take out all opponents.Postal 2 takes place in a small town called ""Paradise"". You play as Postal Dude (that is his actual name, I swear) who lives in a trailer with his wife and his dog. He is rather unsatisfied with his current life. He is completely broke, he is the only person in the neighborhood who lives in a trailer, his wife constantly yells at him, his car barely works anymore. He just started at a new job in games development (guess which company) though. Will that help him to get his life back in order?The gameplay of Postal 2 is split up into five days, starting on Monday. Every day Postal Dude gets a number of tasks that must be completed to proceed to the next day. Many tasks are given by his wife but some are his own decision. A majority of the task are rather mundane, for example cashing in your paycheck, buying milk, getting a christmas tree or buying meat for a barbeque or going to your uncle Dave's birthday party. While none of this sound like a pretty exciting  activity the town of Paradise is full of people who would go ballistic over the most trivial things. So even the most mundane task may end up with Postal Dude either running for his life or being forced to kill everybody in the vicinity. At the beginning of the game you just have to be aware of random people starting fights but every day after completing certain quests Postal Dude gets an additional group of enemies who hate his guts so much that they would attack him on sight without thinking twice. Luckily the law enforcement is just as violent as the other citizens and might be a great ally in cases like that. If you start funny business yourself however they will not hesitate shooting you either. You can tackle all tasks at your own pace and explore the town. Exploration is really rewarding since you might find weapons and items that would not be available yet otherwise and might give you a real edge over your enemies. Also, there are small eastereggs jokes and references hidden all over the place.While the first Postal game featured rather dark themes Postal 2 is full of silly over the top humour. Also it might be the most offensive game ever created. The game depicts various groups of society as exaggerated stereotypical caricatures: Censorship advocates, Christians, Muslims, gays, bankers, animal rights activists, policemen, New Age religions - nobody leaves unscathed. (I will tell you a little secret: You can lure policemen by dropping a donut on the ground.) If I needed to compare the humour of Postal 2 to anything I would probably say South Park.On his quest to survive the week Postal Dude can rely on a huge arsenal of tools and weapons. Melee weapons like tasers, shovels, scythe, machetes or sledgehammers as well as ranged weapons like scissors, pistols, shotguns, napalm launchers, rocket launchers, grenades, infectious cow heads (which spread an unpleasant disease) and molotov cocktails. On top of that you can just kick people. There's another ""weapon"" in Postal Dude's arsenal that should not be left unmentioned: Pee. He can open his pants and just let go. It does not deal any damage but it can stun people briefly if you hit them right in the face. Also, it causes people to either scream at you, flee, attack you or just puke. While this sounds like nothing than an easteregg peeing can be vital to your survival. Fire based weapons are extremely dangerous and when you ever find yourself being on fire you better pee straight up in the air so you can extinguish the flames. It can also be used to clear flames blocking your path or to extinguish burning people other than yourself.As mentioned before there are various tools and items to utilize. Dog biscuits can be used to befriend dogs and make them follow you around. Catnip can NOT be used to befriend cats. Instead you can consume it yourself to slow down the world around you. Cats however can be picked up and either be used as erratic tornadoes of fur and claws (keep your distance) or as silencers to put on your shotgun or assault rifle. A fishing radar comes in handy to show you the position of nearby enemies. Also there are various items that restore health like donuts, pizza or ""Health Pipes"" - be warned though, they are addictive.There is one gripe I have with the game. Some weapons feel really underwhelming. There is basically no point to some of the melee weapons (for example the shovel) as soon as you found a higher tier one. Also the standard shotgun and assault rifle feel to weak.The town of Paradise feels incredibly alive. Bystanders will walk around the place, talk to each other and either go their merry way or start a fight. If they see corpses they will run away or start vomiting. If they see you in an embarassing situation they will laugh at you. Also, it is entirely possible that huge fights break out without the player having done anything to cause them. Considering when the game came out this is impressively done and really conveys what kind of town we are talking about here. The title Postal does not need to refer solely to the main character but can also be seen as representative of Paradise and its citizens. Postal Dude would have all reason to give up and despair but he rather reacts with snarky sarcasm which makes him kind of likeable. I he goes postal eventually depends on the player but believe me, this town will put your patience to a test.This re-released version of Postal 2 comes with the add-on Apocalypse Weekend that covers Saturday and Sunday. The playstyle is a little different though. Apokalypse Weekend still has the humour of the base game as well as some really neat new ideas and mechanics. Sadly it drops the open world exploration aspect completely and often comes down to tunnel shooter levels and arena fights. It is also a problem that the two most ""standard shooter like"" levels are among the longest of the expansion. Do not get me wrong though. It is well worth playing, I just feel that it cannot hold a candle to the base game.For the re-release of Postal 2 the developers added several weapons, mechanics and cosmetic tweaks. Some of those had been featured before in community made mods. The developers really went and asked the modders if they were okay with the mods being included in the main game. That's what I call being in touch with the fans.Also, after the re-release being financially quite successful the developers decided that they could afford to work on a second expansion pack for Postal 2 which is by now released and available as DLC. As far as I know releasing an official expansion ten years after the base game came out is completely unheard of. If this doesn't proof incredible dedication to the fanbase I do not what does.What's more, the expansion called Paradise Lost is much closer to the base game than Apocalypse Weekend was. It also features additional content and improvements some of which have been retroactively added to the base game.Long story short if you have not played Postal 2 yet you should give this classic a try. If the humour is not for you or you are easily offended you might not like it. Otherwise it is well worth your time. If you have played Postal 2 before and liked it you should also pick this version up since it is a step up from the original version in every area.More reviewshere"

,Recommended,223470,34249177,Posted: 14 August,all,TF2Charmander,"This Review is being written while I am playing Paradise Lost, I will update it once I'm finished with it.This is one of my favorite games for many reasons, the comedy is up my alley, the gameplay is fun and stress reliving, the easter eggs and things you can do are so damn stupid that I just love it. I'm gonna talk about the gameplay and what it's like then go into spoilers about what it's like living a week in paradise.So the gameplay is sort of like Half Life but a bit slower, you can walk around and talk to residents, and by that I mean either bump into them and have them say something rude or hit g to say ""GET THE F DOWN!"" before shooting them with a shotgun. The Postal series is controversial for it's violence (especially with the WSJ lying about postal 1 being all about killing children) but Postal 2 took the dark and gritty violence of Postal 1 and made it comedic, with doing stuff like having the residents scream like a cheesy horror movie and the fact that you can use a cat as a silencer. (oh and for cat lovers like me heres a trick if you don't want to kill the cat you just shoot your gun 8 times and hit x to take the cat off and its free.)Now heres me detailing my adventure in Postal 2: A Week in Paradise (because only Postal 3 lovers don't play the full experience)-Monday- You start out with a semi pointless intro cutscene that goes through a little bit of Paradise, AZ. You end up at the the trailer of our hero, The Postal Dude, being forced out by his ♥♥♥♥♥y wife to go do tasks which include, Getting a check from Vince Desi of Running With Scissors (yes RWS put themselves in the game) which ends with a group of protesters outside the office protesting about video games (with the line ""Games are Bad, they make you mad!"") running in to kill everyone, Cashing said check in the bank which has a bunch of robbers come in and rob the place, and picking up some milk. You can do this peacefully or like how you would in real life or you can becine every edgy kid's dream and KILL THEM ALL.-Tuesday- Once again you do tasks, the main one which became a slight meme was the infamous petition to ""Make Whiney Congressmen play Violent Video Games"" aka going around to people and asking ""Sign My Petition"" if they answer you can force them for a few more tries or just straight up murder them which will be really easy to do since 40% of Paradise doesn't want to sign it. Another famous one is to get an autograph from the late Gary Coleman, which always ends in the police coming to kill him. there is also returning a book which has more protesters this time hating on books instead of video games with the line ""Save a Tree! Burn a Book!"" When you do return the book the protesters set fire to the books which causes a fire to happen in the building. Finally and somewhat controversially, you go to church to confess your sins (most likely from the first game considering what you do in it) and afterwards, Terrorists come and try and destroy the place with their lines being something about middle east stuff or just ""ALALALALALALALALA"". When you return home theres dialogue between The Dude and his ♥♥♥♥♥y Wife about Gary's autograph. (this happens at the end of every week but the tuesday one is the best)-Wednesday- The tasks for this week are to♥♥♥♥♥♥on the grave of your dad, Mr. T Dude Sr. (yes that means you are The Postal Dude Jr. I love this family tree), Vote at♥♥♥♥♥♥Asian (or School Daze for me because I played A Week in Paradise), Get a Xmas Tree, and a fourth and final task of picking up laundry after you♥♥♥♥♥♥on your dad's grave because when you do Rednecks hit you with a shovel and you wake up in a BDSM costume. Yeah this game is really weird.-Thursday- This is probably the most tedious day, the tasks are to get a Napalm from the Napalm Factory, Get a Bad Touch Krotchy toy from the mall, Get some Steaks, and Pay a police ticket. I say this is tedious because the Napalm Factory turns into Indiana Jones, getting the toy has 4 different routes (but really you should just go to the back and get it then try to avoid Krotchy), at the meat place where you get the Steaks you go to the back and kill a bunch of butchers (which is a really good place to get weapons) and paying your ticket is easy unless you don't $300 dollars.-Friday- Your tasks include buying a Alternator from Mike, Picking up a package from the Parcel Center, getting a present for Uncle Dave's Birthday, and an optional task of getting checked for Gonorrhea after♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥only once and losing a bit of health (don't do this for speedruns) You will most likely steal the Alternator unless you have a lot of money because it costs $500 dollars. After this the game ends. OR DOES IT-Saturday- So throughout the game nuclear♥♥♥♥♥♥has been going on and now Zombies are appearing, and so Saturday of Apocalypse Weekend starts with an FMV of The Dude waking up from some sort of nightmare involving a fat male nurse trying to give him medicine, (most likely rectal) and hes in a hospital after Friday because he shoots himself after his ♥♥♥♥♥y Wife drives him to do so. After reading cards he gets up and the game begins. The Vets at the hospital work on these radioactive cats that turn into Tornado Rexes and kills people in grusome fashion, you also donate for research by, and I can't believe I'm about to say this, Looking at sexy girls in Postal/RWS shirts and bikinis until you ejaculate into a bucket. Afterwards you have Halluinations of Garys that try to kill you. and you have to go through this puzzle like area that is the Hospital. After getting out you go to Greasy Panda to get some chinese food and there you see the zombies. After doing this killing all zombies mission you then get greeted by an officer and you kill some cows which cause some peta wannabes to try to stop you and its all weird. Then the same officer gives you a Rocket Launcher for the SUPER FUN PIGEON HUNTER MISSION which doesn't happen. Instead an amazing FMV plays of Vince on the phone talking about the budget which is one of my favorite cutscenes in any videogame ever. Vince then calls The Dude to inform him about going to Bullfish Interactive and getting the gold master of Postal 2. after thats over Saturday ends with the Postal Dude staying at Vince's house with some Postal Babes-Saturday- I'm gonna go as quick as possible here. When you wake up Zombies have infested Vince's house so you and RWS team up to kill them all. Then this Mexican dude wants you to kill elephants and get their legs so they can be made into baskets for children. Afterwards Vince calls you to tell you Mike J has been infected with the Mad Cow Disease (causing zombie humans and zombie cows to appear) and you get promoted to new Marketing Manager, so you get explosives to show why you shouldn't mess with RWS and to do this you go to the Terroist Training Camp and they try to kill you. Afterwards you end up in prision with a Terroist cellmate that you set on fire to open the cells and escape. Then you rescue your dog Champ (who was taken to the pound as said in one of the cards in the beginning of saturday) and after after you finally get out of Paradise. But you have to face the boss of a Zombified GOD version of Mike J, and all I got to say is ♥♥♥♥ THIS BOSS! anywho in the end you drive off with champ and set of a necular explosion in Paradise. Ending the game.In total I had gotten the rank of Prozac-Powered Gun Nut after 8 Hours, 41 Minutes, and 57 Seconds of game time."

Suprisingly, this game has had a major impact on me; I played this game when I was like, 13 (though I really shouldn't have) and had the time of my life. Sure this game is gross and kind of a relic of older game design, but it was made by people who love what they do.As for the actual game itself, you play as a man known only as the ""Postal Dude"" living in the town of Paradise, Arizona as he tries to complete a week's worth of errends while avoiding angry mobs, rednecks, Al Qaeda, and a marching band. That's it. That's the basis of the game. You can try and be a pacifist (though it will most likely never work) or you could just run around, set people on fire, then pee on them to put them out. I think this game really shines as a ""do whatever the ♥♥♥♥ you want"" sort of game. The story is really only there to have some sort of narritive, so if you were looking for something beyond ""go here to get your book signed by Gary Coleman and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥up"", you're out of luck.All in all, even if this game was made 14 years ago, there's still a lot of fun to be had here despite it's clunky (but charming) design.

Despite dated graphics, Postal 2 is definitely a loveable game that allows the player to be as violent as they please. You can even try being completely passive, I'd imagine it's difficult, but they say it's doable.Running With Scissors took a simple idea of doing tasks for your wife and made a game out of it, and did it very well. It is thoroughly enjoyable from start to finish, but I confess I've yet to get my lazy♥♥♥♥♥to play everything again. Regardless, the game is immensly enjoyable for those who like the humor in it and the ever lovable voice of Rick Hunter, as the beloved Postal Dude, really nails his lines in a perfect manner.Even more fun is that you can see the game devs themselves on the first day, and you can pass through their offices on your travels. And as an added bonus, they often aid you in combat. So with a large array of weapons (including the ability to♥♥♥♥♥♥everywhere), you'll find many creative ways to kill enemies, cops or innocent bystanders as you try to make it to the end of each day.I'd recommend buying this game at any price, either full retail or on sale, as it is good fun and the developers deserve whatever you could give. But if you are somewhat easily offended, don't like the violence, don't like dated grahics or you are a plain old buzzkill, don't bother getting it.

Honestly, when it came out, it was pretty groundbreaking at the time. In the early-mid 2000's, games were finally able to ""let loose"" shall we say with regard to more adult content. Postal 2 definitely had a lot of firsts in that regard.While Postal 2 is not as shocking now as it was in the past, it's still the one and only game I've played which allows for the player to urinate on people. When this came out a little over 10 years ago (and granted, I was still in High School then), all someone needed to tell me was that you can♥♥♥♥♥♥on people in this game. It reminded me of when I was a kid in Elementary School, and a friend of mine told me about this new game Duke Nukem 3d (at the time). He told me I could pee in toilets and pay women to show me their boobs; I was sold. This is the kind of thing that will be immediately off-putting to some, while immediately endearing to others. With this kind of game, it's a ""love it or hate it"" situation. Even when we're older, sometimes it can be nice to just go back and unwind for a bit. We need to experience what it's like to be a kid again in silly ways, and this is definitely one of them.Unfortunately, Postal 3 was a flop, but hey, more reason to go back to this one! If you've never played it, and if absurd, over-the-top, politically incorrect humor sounds appealing to you, go for it! Have a blast with this one, and don't take it (or yourself) too seriously."

,Recommended,223470,1670192,"Posted: 13 September, 2013",all,phoenix_advance,"Postal 2 is one of those classic games I intentionally neglected a long time ago. I remember back in 2003, my classmates downloaded the game on the school's network drive so everyone could install locally to play. They were just running around and peeing on NPC characters and we were all laughing. I ended up getting a copy and installed it on my Pentium 4 at home. After running around pointlessly not knowing what to do and being frustrated with the long loading times when moving between areas (it’s an open world game), I just uninstalled it.10 years later. I now own it on Steam for reminiscence sake. I spent about 1 hour running about not knowing what to do again. To save you the pain, I’ll say there is an inventory slot above your health. To scroll through your items, you need to press the square bracket buttons on your keyboard. Select the image of a map pamphlet and then press Enter or the F button to use the item. I know it sounds silly, but I swear I learnt how to take off in the DCS-A10C Warthog flight simulator game faster.This game is just awesome for an Unreal Engine implementation. I must say that I didn't have an issue with Unreal back then. But even if so, this game had thought about EVERYTHING! Which puts it ahead of even the latest Unreal Engine games of today. For example, some dude was trying to kill me. So I lured him back to my homestead, killed him with a shovel, to which he got decapitated. I kicked the dudes head, and my pet dog surprisingly went to fetch it and bring it back to me! LOL.What I really like about the game design is that you're in a world. Think sort of like Grand Theft Auto 3 but in FPS and you cannot drive cars. Maybe I don't play much games, but for the ton of games I own on Steam, I'm sure close to none (and definitely none of the Unreal Engine games) implement this unique open world FPS design. The AI actually seem smart as well, especially for its time of release ... I'd almost say revolutionary. Things were much different back then. I still remember character reflections in mirrors and shiny floors were a big thing. Whilst this game didn’t do reflections in floors, they did do character reflections in mirrors.Seriously I thought Saints Row: The Third was ridiculous. But Postal 2 is way over the top. There are a lot of really crude but funny humour in this game to keep you entertained all the way through.The graphics are obviously dated, but I personally find that it gives a bit of production value in terms of it being a classic game now. It also doesn't stop the level designs from being highly explorative. And because the game mechanics is designed so well, you tend to forget the dated graphics.The only thing this game misses is a reason to muck around. Like for example in The Elder Scrolls: Oblivion you'd want to lock pick and steal loot from houses. In Grand Theft Auto Vice City you wanted to get the highest wanted rating and then outrun the cops for as long as you could. Postal 2 doesn't have a reason apart from harder difficulties and cheats being unlocked once you’ve completed the game once. But I’m glad they’ve focused on what makes the game fun to replay again rather than implement a cheap♥♥♥♥♥levelling/skill/perk system. If the game wasn’t a decade old, I would probably replay it.Overall I am extremely impressed with this game. The development team isn’t even large. About the same size as the Doom 3 team. Not small enough to be Indie and nowhere near large enough to be mainstream. It actually baffles me as to why Metacritic has given this a score of 59/100. The gameplay design was just fantastically entertaining and well-paced. I would actually give this game something like an 83/100 if I were to do a review on it.For fun, I told sauce that I didn't know what I was doing waiting in a long♥♥♥♥♥line at the bank in a video game.

It potrays a modern society being corrupt and you play as a social justice warrior... who also seems to be subject to the corruption.  It's kind of twisted, it brings a new concept that I think other games should model off of, and it adds a needed comedic element which really seals this game's good rating.  I'd say 9/10.

You know that doing that one stupid thing will probably follow you around your whole life. How about instead of doing that stupid thing in real life, DO IT IN A VIDEO GAME!Postal 2 by Running With Scissors is the perfect game to do it with given that the main focus of the game is pretty much brutal murder in the most obscene ways.Running on the Unreal 2 engine, postal 2 may not look pretty, but don’t let that stop you from enjoying the utter mindlessness of the game. You play as Postal Dude (no really that’s his actual name “Postal Dude”) who is an angry redhead in a trenchcoat and sunglasses just trying to live a peaceful life in the fictional town of Paradise, although, he is given a set of simple tasks for 5 days.This game can be played two ways: Murdering everyone you see because why the hell not, or not killing or harming a single person (no matter what happens to you), however the developers throw your way a series of increasing annoyances such as long lines at a bank, having to pay postage fees, getting gonorrhea (that actually happens), and the parents against violent games committee ironically pulling firearms and attempting to shoot you on sight.The game is INCREDIBLY obscene and racist. There are the stereotypical turbin wearing terrorists running about and they make their hideout in a convenience store named “The Lucky Ganesh” while you try to go pick up “Jihad brand goat milk” (i’m not ♥♥♥♥ing kidding here).

Postal 2 despite being basic and nothing that special is one of the most enjoyable gaming experiences you can have. A game you can play for hours on end and enjoy it. This is one of the few games that despite it being bare bones on the gaming side actully works in its favor.

I could care less about the tasks they give you in the game because I often get side tracked from them and just go around and killing people. I'm pretty sure back in the day the graphics looked good since I remeber this game being released in early 2003. By today the graphics look quite blocky and outdated but that means nothing because I'm having so much fun. Sometimes you can even find stuff that aren't possible to get with just cheat codes alone. This game also makes exploring fun because who knows what you can find out there. Although since Apocalypse Weekend was released as a seperate expansion originally in early to mid 2005 the graphics by then looked quite dated especially with games like Splinte Cell: Chaos Theory or Battlefield 2 really pushing the envelope back then. The path in Apocalypse Weekend is quite linear so it can get quite boring after a while espcially when the enemies in that game were too easy to kill on average difficulty. I don't care if this game is offensive, I'd recommend this game any day.Please note that this game will crash every so often and sometimes it'll not launch after.

I actually became addicted to playing this game until I beat it, and when I did, I felt kinda sad. Not because the ending didn't satisfy me, but because my journey was over. Honestly, playing the game now and looking back on it, I would totally pay for the Postal 2 + Paradise Lost bundle at full price. The game actually jokes that it's like 500 games in one, and I think they may be right. It was a brilliant experience that I wish I could rediscover all over again."

This is a game where it’s only as violent as you are playing it, you don’t have to kill a single person. Though the game will start testing your patience since some of the objectives involve queuing and the NPCs like to push in and most tasks usually have multiple ways of completing them. After each task is complete something usually goes horribly wrong and a group of lunatics show up with guns, and once this has been done these people will be marked on your map as a group of enemies who will shoot you on sight when you are wondering around. The exploration is handled quite well in this game, there are a lot of nooks and crannies where items can be found.Like I said earlier you can either be a pacifist or you can murder and torture as many people in as many ways as you want, since you have an arsenal filled with kitchen appliances, garden tools, sports equipment, firearms, and explosive and flammable equipment and each weapon is better for different situations. The violence in this game is so over the top that’s its quite funny. This is quite a funny game due to the crazy things that can happen in the game world but the humour is hit or miss, it ranges from cultural parodies, animal cruelty, absurd acts of violence and disgusting behaviour since you can♥♥♥♥♥♥into people’s mouths and they will throw up (you can also put fires out with♥♥♥♥♥♥, and breaking the fourth wall.There are also over dozen difficulty modes, on the lowest difficulty the most powerful weapon the enemies will be armed with is the shovel, on insane-o mode everyone is armed with a random weapon and they will attack if they feel threatened instead of most people running away and screaming in a ridiculous manner, and on they hate me and above everyone is armed and will attack you on sight.The only problem with this game is that it does crash fairly often due to a bug in the game, and it’s got quite a limited appeal since the violence and the offensive parodies can be huge off putters, when this game came out it received mostly negative reviews because of this and disregarding everything else in the game.So this is a really good game, with a lot of replay value and I suggest you play each one (Monday to Friday, and paradise lost) three times, one normally, one being a pacifist and one on postal mode."

Even some ideas were released as offical mods.This game is AMAZING, even though it doesnt live for the whole hype and experience from the first installment it never the less one of the best games to be released in recent years. Valve did it again, and of course there is another fan base wishing for installment number 3 with great hype.overall score:   10/10 - would play again*what do you mean that this is another game?

Mine had a glitch where no one actually carries guns just shovels, police batons, knuckle dusters, molitovs and (near the end) sledgehammers. It is quite random in terms of where you are and what happens, like you go to confess your sins at the church and it gets attacked by terrorists. My advice, always carry a weapon. I made the mistake of not taking a weapon to work on the first day and got killed by protestors.If you want to do everyday things but kill people, go for 'POSTAL 2'. If you want to kill zombies,  insane Gary Colemans (armed with scissors) and defeat the demon-cow big boss, then go for 'Apocolypse Weekend'. If you want the full feel of the game, go for 'A Week in Paradise'  (or something like that, I may be wrong).All in all, this is a great game and I seriously advise you to get it. :D"
,Recommended,223470,13816032,"Posted: 3 January, 2015",all,Treefingers,"Yeah, this game is very fun, but it's not without it's flaws. In this review, I will pick out specific parts of the game to talk about, and they may contain spoilers, so do not read if you do not want to finish playing. (Like this game has spoilers.)First, the game is very offensive to those who take offense to this sort of stuff. Now, I'm not one to be offended, so I had an enjoyable time playing this game. But some might find the stereotypes, the violence, and the overall mature oriented material of the game offensive. That said, they'd know what they're getting into with the content rating and the screenshots on the page.Secondly, the dialogue in this game is clear and can be heard pretty perfectly. However, they often repeat lines, which can get a bit annoying at times. I can't tell you how many times that I heard a pedestrian say ""One side!"" or the Postal Dude say, ""You probably think I'm not a nice person,"" but I know that the count must be in the hundreds by now.Third, the combat in this game is great. However, without a cover system, the first person aspect was a bit tough to grasp and truly not take damage from anyone shooting at you. This made the apocalypse difficult for me, as I had a small amount of health. Also, the boss battles were frustrating, as they had a missile launcher and I had to stand back and shoot them.Honestly, I thought the weekend missions were some of the most repetitive missions I have ever played, and would rather not play through them again. I remember thinking I was almost done with the game at one point, but I had another 10 parts to go. It just jumped the shark too much at the end. The week was fine, I loved the week, but the weekend was just a roadblock to me. The bridge and Mike J. were some of the most frustrating parts of any game for me.Besides those complaints, I still think this is a very good game, and a very fun game. I'd recommend it to those looking for a dose of violence into their lives. Would I recommend it for the story? No, the story is almost non-existent. But the game is fine, and it's fun to just experiement what you can truly do in the game.And the multiplayer is fun. They remove a few weapons from the game, but the perk of playing the game with friends is a large fun perk.Rating: 7.5/10"

Do you like games that push things to the edge in a world of political correctness? Well, POSTAL 2 might just be the game for you.Story:The story of the game is simple. It's all about the protagonist fittingly named Postal Dude and his daily errands. The game is separated into five levels, but if you include the Apocalypse Weekend expansion, there's seven. One level for each day of the week. Each day has it's own list of errands that Dude must complete in order to progress to the next day. As you follow Postal Dude on his journey and complete errands, something always goes wrong such as being attacked by video game protesters, rednecks and various other social groups that become Dude's enemies throughout the game.Gameplay:The game gives you a large arsenal of weapons to combat these enemies. Sure, you can use your standard weapons like shotguns or machine guns, but why stop there when you can get a cat and attach it's rear end to the muzzle? There's a great selection of melee weapons as well. There's sledgehammers, boomerang machetes, shears, scythes and more. So if decapitating your enemies with a shotgun blow to the head just isn't doing it for you, you can run around with your shears and manually dismember your enemies limb by limb. There's also gasoline and matches that you can use to set people on fire. Did I mention that you can♥♥♥♥♥♥on people? Well you can. You can even♥♥♥♥♥♥on yourself. So if you ever find yourself on fire, just unzip, look up and let it rain. You can play the game the way YOU want to play it. If you want to run around shooting everything in sight, you can. However, if you want to play without so much as attacking a single person, you can do that as well. It may be more challenging that way, but it's possible.Conclusion:Overall, this is an amazing game. Don't come looking for a deep, thought-provoking story. This game doesn't have it. But what it does have is incredibly addictive gameplay with practically endless possibilities and a plot that's simple enough to keep your interest along the way. This is one of those games where once you beat it, you likely won't stop playing it for a while. It's a fun sandbox to run around in aimlessly while you watch your favorite TV show or listen to your favorite podcast. If you're offended easily, this game may not be for you. Otherwise, I'd highly recommend it. This may very well be my favorite FPS game of all-time and if it isn't, it's definitely up there."

How you do them, however, is up to you. You can just simply walk into the bank and cash your paycheck, or you can sneak into the vault and take whatever loot you can carry, and also murder half the population of the town.

None of this had anything to do with the story. It has a hit and miss sense of humor, and it is normally racial, childish or shock style of humor and caters to the lowest class of intelligence. I almost never laughed at the dialogue; not because I was offended, but because most of the time it just was not very funny. The game is offensive though and if that is ever taken in to account when making a purchase do not buy this game. The best humor in this game is simply when you create over-the-top murder situations, like butchering the entire town with a limb hacking machete while pretending you are Jason Vorhees. The graphics are good and forgivable for the date of the title. The character models are, well, odd. and their animations are dopey to say the least. The game takes place in a single town called Paradise, the town is small but &quot♥♥♥♥♥quot; to navigate I had to pull up the map a good 100 times. Overall I would say that I personally enjoyed Postal 2, it is certainly not perfect but a good way to kill time. 6/10 Oh and the Apocalypse Weekend is terrible, do not bother with it."

Didn't even know we were out haha, good ol' wife! She always makes sure to remind me of things before I leave the house! Ahh.. anyway, off to the store I go! I waltz through the town, taking in the lovely scenery of my surrounding areas. The women and their scantily clad outfits, the graffiti on the walls, the random man shooting at a cat.. the perfect day! Upon entering my friend Habib's illustrious grocery store, I notice an enticing aroma filling the air that nonetheless stimulated my senses into an outcry of joy. I find the milk, right next to my favorite brand of mayo and proceed to the counter. Sitting in the long line of people, I felt the sudden urge to go to the bathroom. However, I couldn't quite place where the restrooms were. I believe I saw it up front right by the entrance of the store, although I'm not quite sure. I decided to give it a gamble anyway and head towards the entrance.Suddenly, blast doors fell from the ceiling like Lucifer from the high Heavens. My good friend Habib runs out from behind the counter with an automatic rifle and begins unloading at his target. Goodness me, I thought, what ever could he be shooting at?? It wasn't until a bullet hit me that I realized that it was ME. I was his target. Why I had no clue, nor did I stick around to ask questions. Habib was the type to shoot first and answer questions later. I bolted to the only other known exit: the back room storage area. Upon entering, I saw stairs leading up to a second floor. My flight instincts took over and up I went.""ALALALALALALALAHHHHHHHH""I knew that sound immediately and the women dressed in burkas running at me with pistols only confirmed my thoughts: terrorists. What were terrorists doing here in a humble town like this?!? I ran past them as bullets whizzed by, nearly taking my life with every shot. I ran around a corner and into a room. I lost them, I thought. Gathering myself, I looked around the room I was in. A restroom. It was a restroom. Wonderful. Welp, I might as well relieve myself now before my bowels do it involuntarily after my death. That's when I had the epiphany that saved my life: I may not have had any weapons to fight with, but that didn't mean I had no fight IN me. Unzipping my pants, I kicked down the door and laid waste to my attackers. Literally. I left no area uncovered. Their arms, legs, torsos, heads, and mouths were all devastated by my unending onslaught of urine-y destruction. Vomit spewwed from them like pus from a large pimple and it was enough to bring them to their knees in sheer agony. It was the golden shower from Hell, the power to wield it bestowed upon me by Satan himself. I retraced my steps, annihilating all who stood in my way until I found Habib..To spare details, let's just say that no amount of Bounty or Charmin combined could saved Habib from his liquid grave. It was done. I had defeated my attackers and in doing so, I ended a jihad and got my loving wife her milk for free. I guess you could say, it was one of those unzippity doo da days!10/10, would R.

With a cameo from Gary Coleman (yes, the real Gary Coleman) and jabs at terrorist groups such as Al Quada and Osama Bin Laden and Tora Bora(in the most racist-ly funny ways possible) it is aa slightly true to life yet a slightly parodical look at life and pop culture in the early 2000's.Trying to be offencive yet honestly only being ""as violent as you are"" it IS possible to play thru this game and not kill a single soul.... not saying NO ONE will die, but if you so choose it wouldn't occur by your hand. With gasoline and matches and ""unorthodox"" methods of rifle/shotgun suppression (cats) and smoking Cat Nip to have pseudo-matrix bullet-time abilities, it is a quintessential game for lovers of nonsense, over-the-top violence, immature yet funny jokes about fart poop and pee, and a one-liner spouting Duke Nukem-esque protagonist, its definetly a different shooter from a very different time.

Basicly with Postal 2 you can ethier follow the main objectives such as get milk, collect your pay check, ect. Or you can kill everyone in the town♥♥♥♥♥♥on people and do many hilarious things. I was skeptical of the game at first due to the fact it looked like a run of the mill indie FPS game. The only few grypes I have with the game are that the animations on the NPCS looked a little bit stiff. The only other thing is I found the main character to be kind of generic, he was okay but really didn't get much backstory, I mean i didn't expect much but at least somthing. all we really got was he is a dude in his trailer with his wife and he got a new job. The graphics are great for the time due to it being run on the Unreal engine. I know many people have had mixed opinions about this game, some say its good others say it sucks. I think it does have it's problems but those problems are able to look past, for they don't ruin the game. My final opinion on the game is it's repaly value is extensive and the over all style is a refreshing change to most FPS games out there. you can find it for pretty cheap on steam it's on sale right now so get it when you can. My final verdict is 7.3/10."

It was around that time my parents audited the few games I had watching what I played making sure it wouldn't turn me into a deranged individual, carefully informing me of every action I did in a particular game was either impossible or unaccetable behaviour in real life.Getting to actually play this game as an adult I wonder if the controversy started as a ploy to sell the game.Well onto the review,  Its filled with crued toilet humor and mindless weird violence.  It's not a horrible game but felt like it was made as some kind of crazy parody of what people thought was in all violent video games, I'm not going to bother to look up the wiki page to see if thats the case and really feel no desire research the insperation of the game.It's funny if you like fart jokes and laugh at the idea of urinating on things.

When someone sees you in their home they either shoot you or run to the nearest cop which will try to arrest you. The cops need to know first to go after you.2) No guns. This is probably my favourite. There are several groups that will shoot you on sight. Don't have a gun? Are you a pacifist and won't fire back? No problem, find a cop and he will protect you.There is ton of things you can do: lure dogs using treats, lure cops with donuts, rob a bank, get people to laugh at your♥♥♥♥♥♥♥and burn them afterwards even use a cat as a silencer. Or you can go throughout the game without killing anyone.It is not necessarily a violent game, it is entirely up to you how you will react to the events. Protestors storming your place of work? Sure, you can shoot them, burn them, bludgeon them with a shovel or throw scissors at them but you can sneak out without being seen as well.This game is a well put together sandbox.

I liked the insane atmosphere and action of Postal so I was sure interested about the sequel. For my surprise Postal 2 focused more on dark humour instead of insanity. Player didn't have to kill every single NPC anymore, and there were now alternative ways to progress in the game. And it worked and still works today.The player is Postal Dude, a guy living in a small American village of Paradise. He is supposed to do some simple errands like buying milk, voting and getting his paycheck. Errands can be accomplished by different ways so the game fits to different playing styles. You can buy stuff or steal them. You can wait at the end of the line or rush over the desk and help yourself. I personally steal and run away.

When you have done all of the days errands, you can come back your home and move to the next day.The village of Paradise is an open sandbox where you can roam freely. You can break into people's houses and steal their money and other usefull stuff. You can kick doors open and crash windows. You can open your zipper and♥♥♥♥♥♥on where ever you want. If the police see or hear you doing anything stupid they might arrest you and put you to jail. I personally like to make people mad on me by♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥on them, then running away and letting police to kill them or letting them kill police. Every time you move to another day the map regenerates and changes a bit so you can explore and loot it again.The culture of the Paradise is rich on its own way. People of the village are stereotypes of the American society. There are dirty rednecks, silly gays, bearded terrorists, busty women, cats, dogs and different kind of protestors. As you progress in the game you will meet many of these groups and usually have to fight against them. Or just run away while they are filling your body with bullets. Or you can just dress gimp suit and let your enemies laugh at you.I recommend Postal 2 for everyone who like dark humour, video game violence and open world gaming. You can do nasty things and get virtual people mad. You can just stand on a street and observe while people are killing each other or take your scissors and make everyone bleed.If you don´t like to see people get beaten, shot, sliced and burned alive this game could be too disturbing for you. Also, if you don't like to see dead animals or hear swearing then be warned as there are plenty of that. Notice this game uses the old Unreal 2 engine and the graphics and the sound are mostly like they were at 2003. For me it looks and sounds good enough.This Postal 2 pack also includes the Apocalypse weekend (saturday and sunday). The weekend is not like the first five days of the base game as there are no sandbox or free roaming but instead you progress on a linear path from level to level. I was bored while playing the weekend, but if you like traditional FPS-games with horror theme I could nearly recommend the Apocalypse weekend for you.Edit 1: Minor grammatical fixes."

I now have over 700 hours logged and consider it my favorite game of all time.First off - it has a TON of content, difficulty levels, achievements, and Easter eggs.  The 700+ hours I have logged are from single player only!  You can really play single player mode for months and still find new things in the original game.  Secondly - the Paradise Lost DLC functions as a sequel (though the plot does make more sense if you at least know about the defunct sequel Postal III).  You get a whole sequel for the price of the DLC, which is a great deal to me!The only ""bad parts"" would be the graphics (to some people) and the content (to others).  The humor is immature but isn't meant for children.  Watch the trailers before buying it to make sure it doesn't make you uncomfortable and don't play it around your kids if you have them.  The devs make it very clear even during the game that it is NOT meant for kids.Most of the graphics are pushing the limit on what a system from the early 2000s can do.  That said, they update it a lot, and with Postal Complete (the Steam version) the old school fun is mixed with newer graphics that should make anyone over 16 years old happy.5 stars, big thumbs up, waiting for another sequel.-ancient"

Instead of pressing r to reload, you zip open your pants, and pee on people. There's no reloading in this game, so it makes the firefights a lot less dragged out. The enemies later in the game, though, get a lot harder. I relied on one-shot-kill weapons, like the baseball bat and the sledgehammer, but guns like the sawed-off shotgun are a lot of fun to use as well. The game has an interesting way it gives you quests. Your ♥♥♥♥♥y wife sends you out to do♥♥♥♥♥♥because she's too lazy and/or fat to do it herself. So, every day, you have a list of errands to run for the ♥♥♥♥♥. It's a concept that I've never seen in any other games before.The game, overall, is pretty fun. Apocalypse Weekend is kind of boring and dragged out. If it wasn't for Apocalypse Weekend, I would have given this game a 9/10. There are (i think) 5 parts to the military base, and because you don't get all of your weapons back, and ammo is scarce, I couldn't use my sawed-off shotgun as much, and I didn't have my baseball bat, which could knock people's heads off. I didn't get all of my drugs back, so I died a lot of times. The zombies are creepy. I don't like the zombies. You can hear them swearing under their breaths, which is funny, but when you turn around and there's a zombie behind you gnawing your♥♥♥♥♥off, it kind of undermines the whole attitude of the game, which is sarcastic. This isn't a horror game. I like zombies, but not in a game made so that I can knock people's heads off and pee on doughnuts and feed it to cops.The normal week is good. I like the normal week.

The wise-cracking comments and the ""narrative"" is really what keeps this game alive.If you need an escape from an always politically correct and highly professional attitude, I would highly recommend this game, because it really delivers on all fronts. Just don't do it in public.I've never, in my life, played a game like this before. Duke Nukem is the closest thing. It's bloody hilarious, full of irony and sarcasm, but combat is like the worst crap ever made and controls can be a bloody mess especially switching from one to the other or using a special drug or whatever, but somehow the never ending dry wit keeps the engine running.In the begining I thought combat in this game was just a cheap slab-on to a bloody weird Adventure game,  that required a bit of bang and violence to pull off some really  wacky stunts and gross violence, but eventually there was nothing but combat, which never really felt as anything, but a joke - that sometimes makes you laugh. Some guns are really lame and some are really awesome. Range works pretty well in a surprisingly convincing way.The game has a few issues, that can only be resolved by reloading the game like the game sometimes plays itself a bit too much, which can make semi-vital characters  disappear, because they got shot, scared off or eaten by something in the game, I guess.For the most part I stuck to the Machete, Sledgehammer, Sniper and Sawed-off shotgun, but for all the BOSS fight I often switched to the Missile Launcher, which is a truly weird gun, but much worse in the hands of enemies, that fire some peculiar slow-moving heat-seeking missiles..At some points you are stripped of all weapons, which wouldn't be so horrible if you got them all back, but at the end of POSTAL 2 I was suddenly stuck with nothing, but useless military crap and four different kinds of lame in regards to rocket handling. I really missed the Sawed-off shotgun. It's at times like those that you learn how to make use of all those weird items you've picked up during the game and they really make a huge difference in the right combinations.One other thing I really like about this game is that, killing one type of character doesn't make everyone else of them hostile unless they saw me do it, but even then it never carries over even though they will sometimes remember if you come back. I never got arrested in the game, because I always got rid of witnesses including cops, which unfortunately also means that I lost out on some Achievements. There are a few occassions like all the major missions where you attack a faction that you will gain the hostility of members of that faction everywhere you go, but quite often both Lawmen, Special Forces or Civilians will intervene and as long as you don't draw your gun they will ignore you. If you've got a dog friend it will defend you too. There were also some special shotgun-toting ""girls"" that got in the way - game girls(?). It was actually pretty hard to tell foe and friend apart, which led to the untimely deaths of a few extra stragglers, every now and then.Stability: I generally saved a lot, both ""Easy"" and Normal and thus crashing was never really much of an issue. POSTAL 2 crashed on me once, shortly after a quicksave, no issues after Load. In POSTAL 2: Paradise Lost the game crashed quite often from QuickLoading in the game about half-way through, but never from the Menu. Some areas are a bit more sensitive. In the Apocalyptic end of Paradise Lost it was crashing every five seconds at the default settings until I dropped all the Densities, Lifetimes, Population and Ragdolls to zero.Even though the fps was constantly fluctuating a lot the gameplay was completely fluent without any stutters or noticeable fps drops. I was playing on default settings plus additional quality overrides enabled in the Nvidia Control Panel until the last thirty minutes of Paradise Lost.My system:OS: Windows 10 Pro 64-bit (Version 1607)RAM: 12 GB RAMGFX: GTX 770 (API 12 - 378.66)CPU: Core i7 960AUDIO: Onboard Realtek HD ALC892 (Dx12)Not sure, I'd play it again, not anytime soon, because I still consider this game to be an Adventure, and a very good one of that, and since Adventures generally have very little replay value for me... I'd probably do some spot-on-achievement-hunting just to see what I missed, but that's going to be more like picking games I saved, than a fresh start."

,Recommended,223470,8335969,"Posted: 27 December, 2013",all,Spooky Scoot 🎃,"I may be the dumbest genius ever. At least, that’s how I feel after playing Portal 2’s fantastic single-player campaign. Many puzzles in the last third of the eight to 10 hours (perhaps less, depending on how clever you are) of its brain-bending puzzle “test chambers” had me convinced at one point or another that they were completely unsolvable, and that some bug or sadist game designer placed the exit just out of reach. I’d let out exasperated sighs as every attempt met with a dead end. I’d grimace in disapproval as I plummeted to my death for the tenth time. I’d consider surrender.Then, through either sudden revelation, divine inspiration, or total accident, it would come to me: use the orange Propulsion Gel to reach the energy bridge, then catapult across the chasm and shift my blue portal to the inclined surface (in mid-air, mind you) to launch me up to the ledge, grab the refraction cube and redirect the laser beam to wipe out the turrets and activate the switch! It’s so simple, I can’t believe I didn’t see it until now. One half of Portal 2’s brilliance is making me kick myself for not thinking of the impossible; the other is making me feel immensely satisfied with myself when I finally do, again and again.That achievement is made possible by the wondrous Portal Gun, the game’s sole piece of equipment. Unchanged from the first game (except for some subtle but slick texture work and portals that can be seen through walls, Left 4 Dead-style) the easy-to-use gun reliably casts one orange portal and one blue portal against certain walls, allowing you to magically, instantaneously pass from one to the other, regardless of distance, obstacles, or line of sight, while preserving momentum. It’s the ultimate non-weapon weapon, a sort of physics-based Judo-bazooka that redirects the strengths of energy and objects in motion toward its user’s goals—including the user herself. Wielding it makes me feel more powerful—and smarter—than nearly any other gun in gaming.The third half of Portal 2’s brilliance is its story. (Yes, third half. If Valve can disregard the laws of physics in its game, I can disregard the laws of math in my review.) Its chambers are cohabitated by hilariously well-written and acted characters that exude personality, despite none of them being technically people. All three major roles rattle off absurd dark humor and petty insults at every turn. Evil robot GLaDOS is in top politely murderous form right from the moment she appears on screen (spoiler alert: she’s still alive!), but Portal’s show-stealing monotone antagonist is challenged for the spotlight by Wheatley, the bumbling, chattering robot who helps you escape.Fantastically voiced by British actor Stephen Merchant (basically playing the same mind-bogglingly stupid character from the Ricky Gervais comedy Extras), Wheatley’s a doofus AI who makes you turn around while he hacks doors (he can’t do it while you’re watching). Also in the mix is actor JK Simmons, who lends his fittingly cantankerous voice to the founder of Aperture, Cave Johnson, whose comically sociopathic approach to science is second only to GLaDOS’.Sure, I saw the plot twists coming, but still looked forward to witnessing exactly how the characters would react. Through death, resurrection, revenge, and reversal of fortune, their charm makes what would otherwise be an empty and lifeless world feel boisterous and alive—and more than makes up for the player character being a faceless mute.It does all this and more while recycling very few of Portal’s greatest comedy hits—there’s nary a nod to dishonest cake, and the beloved Weighted Companion Cube makes only a cameo appearance. And the finale? Not challenging in the least, but a spectacular and extremely clever finish to the story, with extra points for those who’ve paid close attention to Mr. Johnson.Without changing the nature of the established and celebrated gameplay, Portal 2’s gentle learning curve begins by reintroducing us to its basic concepts, then keeps on introducing new inventions to use with portals until around three quarters of the way through, and chambers become complex jungles of hazardous obstacles. Lasers emitting from walls combine with moveable Refractor Cubes to create the closest thing Portal 2 has to an offensive weapon—an aimable laser—but more often your job is to focus the beam on trigger switches through portals. Infinitely useful Excursion Funnels (levitation beams) and Light Bridges are more than just here-to-there movers—they can be applied to block or push away turrets, halt a catapulting jump before it throws you into oblivion, or help you climb a sheer wall.I’m a little less wowed by the three flavors of viscous gel, which flow with a hypnotic globular effect from spouts and coat the environment in bouncy, speedy, or portal-receptive ooze. Unlike most of Portal 2’s other devices, these have only a couple of uses at most, and can be difficult to control. It’s a hassle when you’re trying to paint an orange runway up to a blue bouncing patch that launches you through a portal cast on a white patch, only to have an errant blob of blue splash over everything. That’s not to say that it’s not great when your work of physics-defying impressionistic art comes together, of course.Locations are amazingly varied, as they must be to support this extended-length puzzle-athon without becoming monotonous. Aperture Science has fallen into disrepair in the indeterminate length of time between the greatly exaggerated “death” of its caretaker overlord and now, and many of its once-spotless test chambers are now rusted, grimy, and overgrown with vegetation. Maps shatter in front of our eyes as Aperture collapses on itself, while GLaDOS’ hundreds of robot arms gradually repair and rearrange the chambers piece by piece. All of this scripted activity animates what would otherwise be still and samey-looking rooms due to Portal’s lack of foes other than stationary turrets.The Aperture facility is far more vast than we could’ve imagined, and the quest to escape leads through its industrial bowels, a cavernous underground sewer-like area, and a long-forgotten retro 1960s version of Aperture, among others. Some areas are so dramatically different that even the basic button triggers and doors have unique looks to them, and everything is impressively modeled and textured, right down to the Easter-egg graffiti hidden throughout. Fine-brush touches extend to the sound, too, such as the wind wooshing in your ears during long drops, or tingly electric chimes that introduce themselves to the background music when you’re speeding on Propulsion Gel. Between puzzles, Portal 2 is full of thrilling showcase moments, such as a mad-dash escape from an angry intelligence that controls the very walls, followed by a surprising take on the boss battle that, without a shot fired, made me feel dangerously out-classed next to my adversary.Right around that time is when the test chambers become increasingly elaborate and intimidatingly huge—to a fault in some cases. These jumbo puzzles are so immense that, even using the handy camera zoom function, spotting the exit can take a few minutes of exploration. Setting out to solve a puzzle when you don’t know what objective you’re working toward is the wrong kind of challenge, and some will find it frustrating. Later levels have multiple contiguous puzzles that can seem like they might never end, and made me miss the pace of the early game where I’d get a refreshing break between challenges.I always solved them, though. Even though a couple stumped me in a very serious way for up to a half hour, I couldn’t give up until I made it to the other side. If you like a challenge, it’s impossible to put this game aside until you’ve burned through all of it."

This game is WAY too violent for my taste, but I still like the game, the way to can explore everything and everything has it’s own purpose. I would rate the game around 7.5/10, and it’s for really entertaining purpose only, as I have to say, unfortunately, the game’s plot is poor, the plot is really messed up and you can’t find a complete fluent and connecting story throughout the game, as random things keep happening and it’s hard to anticipant what will happen next and to make sense of why events happened.I have to admit, even though the story was not as good and the graphic could be improved, but I had absolute fun playing this game, this game really does the job on entertaining you and enjoying simplify just being silly in the Paradise AZ. A final point I like to make is that maybe, maybe the game is a little too expensive for its actual value. As you can see, it is $9.99 for a single copy, but you only can play for a week (In the game) and you finish the game, you have to do objectives for 7 days and it took me around 20 hours to finish the game (Of course, there are people that completed faster than that).

,Recommended,223470,15971286,"Posted: 23 May, 2015",all,Jero,"Disclaimer: I have a lot of respect for the developers behind Postal 2. Not because they said a thing here or there that I happen to agree with, but because of multitude of reasons. They have the balls to stand behind their principles and their own creative work, they still support their games with patches and updates years after release and they're very transparent when it comes to something like say admitting failures (i.e. Postal III).I also only spent one euro on this game which basically means I might as well have went into their offices, set all their computers on fire and stealing all of the Postal merchandise while laughing maniacally. So with that in mind, I'll probably be a bit biased in this review. Still what isn't worth one euro?Postal 2 is kind of an odd beast, it's almost indescribable. At first glance, it looks like some kind of weird, unfinished programming school project, not to imply that the people behind it weren't talented or weren't passionate behind this project. The game is no stranger to controversy thanks to its violence, stereotypical depictions of certains groups and even accusations of animal abuse, but is the game any good? It's true that the graphics are uglier than Quasimodo and the hit detection is more off than Ray Charles on a shooting range, but I do feel that are a lot of good things that can be said about this game.Postal 2 tells the tale of a skinny, deranged man known only as the Postal Dude. He lives in a campavan together with his fate wife and his dog Champ. Your objective is to complete a couple of mundane errands like buying milk, urinating on your fathers grave or confessing your sins and try to survive doing all these tasks for five days. You can perform these in any order you want and occasionally you can have multiple ways in completing these.The catch? There's no catch! Well, okay there are certain groups that are out there to kill you while you're trying to peacefully exercise your second-amendment rights, but besides that you have the freedom to do whatever you want! Kick in a window, steal the food of the inhabitants and then while you're at it urinate on their faces if they happen to be home! Postal 2 features a relatively small town, but it's a blast to explore. There's tons of secrets, buildings you can enter, but most importantly: lots of NPCs THAT WILL FEEL YOUR WRAITH AS YOU SHARE YOUR PAIN W-I mean *ahem* to observe and have a friendly conversation with. They're very funny citizens with crazy lines that manage to somehow be both oblivious and self-aware at the same time. It's also worth noting that this concept of spending a week in the life of man who hates his live and can virtually do whatever he want and can take it all out on whatever he wants hasn't really been done before in this context and should be applauded for it. Thanks to a wide variety of weapons (firearms, melee weapons, explosives...) you can potentially play as the most violent psychopath there is and the little town of Paradise, Arizona is your playground. Anyway, in case you think blood is icky, there's no need to worry. The amount of violence is soley up to the player going as far as make no-kill runs possible.It's no secret that Postal 2 is trying to be funny. Taking the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of America, terrorists, politicians, child stars and much more. Humor is for the most part subjective and I can't say that this particular brand is something everyone can enjoy, but in my case, it does manage to get a laugh out of me. Special mention goes out to the Postal Dude, because anything that comes out of his mout is hilarious thanks to his amazing voice. It's as if the greatest radio host on earth had a baby with a serial killer. It makes me glad he voices the Postal Dude in every game is in....Well, the ones that count I mean. Even if it's not your cup of tea then you'll be happy to know that most of the jokes present can be completely ignored. You can usually find the attempts at humor somewhere in the background like on a bill-board so even if you find that it's the most obnoxious thing you've ever subjected yourself to in your life it won't be constantly shoved in your face like in the later Saints Row games as if it's a child on a sugar rush.So what are we to make of Postal 2? It's almost hard to really say anything about it, because the game can be taken in a lot of different ways. Maybe you will try a pacifist run and come out as a moral victor? Or is it to explore the town and experiment with the game's strange environment and A.I.? To get a laugh perhaps? Make no mistake, this game is by no means for everyone, but with the right mindset, I'm sure there's something you'll enjoy as long as you don't take it too seriously and aren't easily offended. For me personally, it's to relieve stress. I hear a lot of stories about how fun it is to cause chaos in Grand Theft Auto and then try to avoid the police, but in all honesty, I prefer how Postal 2 does it. The weaponry is a lot more fun, the size of the maps are appropriate for the amount of content and there's even some social commentary going even if it's as subtle as a sledgehammer to the face. Yes, even less subtle than Grand Theft Auto, but it's still hilarious. I'm surprised nobody has tried to make a modern spiritual successor.And what is with this soundtrack? It mostly consists out of ambiant tracks seeing as how you'll spent most of your time in stores, hospitals etc. and metal which the game dubs ""Songs to go Postal By"". It has no business being this good, I have no idea how Running with Scissors managed to accomplish this. What are you blackmailing this musical genius with, Running with Scissors??  Anyway, special mention goes to the map music which is probably the best piece of elevator music I've ever listened to.Postal 2 on Steam also comes with the expansion pack ""Apocalypse Weekend"" giving you an additional two days worth of content with new weapons, levels and enemy types. It has a few interesting twists to it, but is ultimately less fun to play than the base game because it's a lot more linear and it's plagued with ""kill all x"" sections. So you've got at least more than 10 hours worth of gameplay for your first playthrough. The game is very buggy, has robotic animations, is unappealing to look at even for the time, but I still think it's a very intriguing game. Even with all these violent, gory games on the market that are way too often generalized by the media and puritains, I honestly can't say there's a game quite like Postal 2 and that almost makes me sad. So if you're interested then by all means go for it. It's often on sale with 90 percent off its original price so you won't lose much either way.Oh, and if you're thinking of getting Postal III: don't."

,Recommended,223470,30518092,Posted: 14 March,all,Kööpa,"Postal 2 is such a perfect prime example of the difference between paid for, corporate reviewers and shills like IGN, Gamespot, etc. and actual consumers. When this game was initially released, those aforementioned ""gaming journalists"" (We like to use that term very lightly) absolutely♥♥♥♥♥♥upon this game. 4/10, 3/10 everywhere you looked. This is most likely due to the fact that Running with Scissors isn't exactly on par in the financial department with companies like Ubisoft or Square Enix, who can easily just pay their way to glowing reviews. So, of course, naturally in the eyes of the simpering casual consumer who blindly believes anything these corporate drones espouse, it was viewed as a failure. Fast forward to the present, wherein this game was ported to steam and it receives a resounding positive approval from people who ACTUALLY play games, and aren't just forced to meet some arbitrary deadline. Not only that, but the game's constant and irreverent anti-PC humor is even more prevalent now in our current social climate than it was over a decade removed. You play as your average everyday, unassuming jagoff by the name of The Dude who spends his days working and doing various mundane chores and errands for his wife. Except every single time he waltzes out of his trailer, everything goes to hell. It offers so much in terms of player choice, you could just play the game by doing all of the errands in a normal fashion or just endlessly ♥♥♥♥ around for hours killing every innocent person in sight and use the plethora of mods the community has to offer. The setting gives you that perfect middle class everyday feeling while also adding a lot of eccentric and insane people to interact with, not to mention the town is full of secret areas and various places to explore and weapons to find. Each errand you have to go on winds up becoming hilariously insane and over the top, such as my personal favorite wherein you must go to a church to confess your sins and the priest says to you ""Did you put money in the box? Okay, you're forgiven"" ♥♥♥♥ing brilliant. Then of course, the church is then attacked by the most stereotypical terrorists you can imagine, easily one of the funniest moments in gaming for me. I spent countless hours constantly going on massacres and using all of the various weapons, all of which are extremely satisfying, even the simple hedge clippers, in which you can pop anyone's head off in quick succession. A true classic gem in every sense of the word, offers countless hours of entertainment, and in today's gaming world where censorship is running like a rampant plague, we need another Postal more than ever."

Definately, even though it feels a bit forced in some areas.Even then this brief sentence doesn't even scratch the surface of describing POSTAL 2.POSTAL 2 is just one of those games you play when you're in the 'I don't give a sh*t' mood. Because this game doesn't give a damn ethier. It's a new level of ridiculous and it gets a little higher the more you play.Gameplay: One of the tag lines for POSTAL 2 is that ""It is only as violent as you are."" Meaning the game gives you the oppertunity to be a sadistic ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ till your hearts content. But, you don't have to be one if you don't want to.  For example, one goal of the game is to pick up some milk from the super-market.  I could act like a normal person by getting the milk, paying for it, and leave. But, I could also be a total a-s-s hole and shoot my way through the store to get the milk. While♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥on the cashier for good measure.Thats really the interesting thing about POSTAL 2. You can't hold the game at fault for being violent because it doesn't force you to be. YOU choose to be a bad person, not the game.  Maybe that's the point it's trying to make as it does rail against the whole violent video games make you violent agrument.You can complete mission objectives at your own leisure and approach. So it is like a sandbox game in which missions can be done at anytime. Exploring Paradice to collect items, weapons, and to see more of the game's humor is always fun to do. That, or you could just♥♥♥♥♥♥on everyone walking down the street if you want and see how many cops shoot at you...Guilty as charged.Story: You play as the POSTAL Dude. Seriously, that's his name. Dude. The recent nobody to move into Paradice along with your dog Champ and trailer-trash wife. Each day consists of you doing errands in Paradice. Things like getting milk, getting your paycheck and so forth. But, something or someone always wants to get in your way. Protesters, bank robbers, islamic terriorists, gimps, redneck hillbillys, etc. How you choose to deal with them is up to you.Sound: Nothing really stellar of sound design in POSTAL 2 but isn't the worst I've seen. Dude is amusing to listen to as he spouts quips in nearly every situation he's in.  It really adds to Dude's character. The kind of guy that takes himself way too seriously."

Nearly any methods of extreme cruelty are free for your use, things you may have never even imagined of doing to others.Postal 2 was obviously a low budget game, but incredibly well done, in all aspects, the gameplay, the graphics, everything were above decent relative to the budget. I found everything about the game satisfying and didn't leave me with the ""oh gosh, why is this here, why can't I do this, that's stupid"", no, it was perfection, not including the AI, which was a little disappointing at times. The shooting has little to no recoil but I didn't find this at all game breaking, the shooting mechanics were very good, I find the pace in all shooters to be one of the most important aspects and the pace of this game was very satisfying. You need to abandon all hopes for realistic mass murder for this game, because there's going to be mass murder, but it's not going to be realistic at all.And the satire and mockery for american society was genius, South Park fell to its knees in front of this game (nearly).This game is a legendary cult game and should be played by anyone who has a hot spot for (very) dark humor, cynicism, political satire and of course, bloody gory violence.Abandon your morals, prepare for comedy, prepare for cruel violence.Because this is not for the majority of people, just for the obvious reasons I mentioned, is why it's a cult game, and surprisingly good.PROS and CONS+Surprisingly satisfying gameplay for the low budget game it is.+Surpsisingly bug free with the exception of a few crashes (hence frequent saving advised).+Absolutely hilarious political satire, stereotypes and humour, best in any video game ever.+13 difficulty levels.-Very bad AI."

After about a month of half-hearted attempts to download it (The game is only 3 gigs, but I have limited free time and rubbish internet) I finally finished the download and decided to try it. I immediately noticed a distinct lack of subtitle options, which did not bode well as I do not live alone and correctly assumed the game would have a considerable amount of profanity. However, there have been no issues yet with the language situation. I will mention that the controls aren't always what they are supposed to be, which has caused a fair bit of confusion.Beyond that, this game is clearly dated graphically however this does not bother me. I've never really cared about the graphics in games. The violence, while extreme for it's time is fairly unrealistic and often comical. Clearly, this isn't a game for children but parents of teenagers should not be concerned about their offspring's mental health with this game. Furthermore, it's only as violent as you want it to be. While you may have to defend yourself in certain scenarios it is entirely possible to finish the game without firing a shot in anger (or so I'm told, I only made it to Wednesday before going nuts). In fact, a good part of the fun for me was trying to stay peaceful in a crazy world. Now, I've only made it to Thursday's first task so I don't know how insane it gets but it's been rather enjoyable so far.Every single review mentions the cat silencer (but neglects to state that it's only for your shotgun) and your ability to urinate on people at will. I was also fond of the ability to show my character's genitals to random women, that was a safe way to unleash one's inner flasher. There are also ""health pipes"" to smoke and plenty of fast food to eat.So, in conclusion it's a cheap bit of fun for those who don't take life too seriously. Or fans of Uwe Boll, as his film Postal is absolutely bonkers and not too far off from the stuff in this game.(Edit: Meant to change this ages ago. The cat silencer can be used on the assault rifle, but as it fires so quickly it's useless.)"

If you like games that allow you freedom of choice, yet have a storyline/quests ect. and action then I would reccomend you get this game, though the graphics are outdated (only by 10 years) and by todays standard the gameplay may be a bit lacking compared to GTA or Saints row it is still an enjoyable game esspecially if you just want to kill time or don't know what else to do."

Granted I'm playing this on a piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥laptop so it's hard to play a game made post-2006 but nonetheless this game is still fantastic.The graphics are nothing spectacular (even for a game released in 2003) but what makes this enjoyable is the open world and the endless carnage you get to unleash upon it. From the moment I beat someone to death with a shovel, set them alight and then urinated on their torched corpse I knew I was in for a fun time. The shooting mechanics are nothing amazing and pretty basic; but it's using the melee weapons where the game truly shines. Dismembering screaming bystanders witha set of hedge clippers was a morbid delight.Having purchased the complete Postal 2 collection (including Weekend Apocalypse) and having thoroughly enjoyed my experience I was delighted to see that DLC was available for the game 11 YEARS since the last expansion. I also got myself Paradise Lost and hhave just started this. So far, it's been a juvenile delight with plenty of cussing, blood and shameless toilet humour.If you're looking for something that will metally and physically challenge you, pushing your gaming skills to the test; or you're seeking an in-depth and engaging story then this is not the game for you.

The gameplay of the actual game is pretty fun once you understand it. I do have to say that the game is more of a open world-kill-shoot game, the story mode could be better. What I most enjoy playing the game is the option to basicly do anything you want! From walking down the street not bothering anyone to running in the middle of the road throwing molotovs and grenades. Graphics of the game are not that good, but becase of all the options ingame it doesn't matter that much. In my opinion the multiplayer mode of the game is executed rather poorly because I noticed quite a lot of bugs and glitches with player interaction. I think the game could be improved if the multiplayer and singleplayer option would be brought into one menu instead of launching them separately. Here is a list of the things I enjoyed/didn't enjoy about the game:- > Good < -+ A lot of weapons+ Freedom to kill anyone+ Option to not follow the storymode+ Meddium quality graphics- >  Bad < -- Glitchy Multiplayer- Short Story modeNontheless the game is great if you wan't to go burn and explode random people!

The replaybility of this game is perfect, and even if you get bored of the main storyline there are thousands of mods for postal 2, I'd recommend eternal damnation, and if you want to play an entirely different storyline there is DLC from the devs, but this isn't DLC where you get a weapon skin, this is an entirely new storyline, there are 5 DLCs, each with their storylines, new weapons, new plots.This game is 10/10Would recommend"

I mean, give me the game in which you can♥♥♥♥♥♥on people, animals, kill them, use cats as a silencer, play fetch with severed head, run with ding-ding-dong out of pants etc. with good ratings from magazines. They will never do that, they will never support as offensive game like this.But hell, offensive is good. Sometimes. In games mostly.Postal 2 is a sandbox. The first installment is cold and a bit depressing shooter you can still use to kill your stress or few spare minutes of your time. Second one is obviously more humorous, open and addictive. To be honest, it's freedom impressed me more than open world in GTA: Vice City in the time i was playing both for first time.There aren't many activities in game's world, but the ones you've got are fun, and you never get bored. Especially that bloody mall from tuesday I believe. I remember spending hours walking around the shops. Or police station and the satisfaction I've always felt after running away, taking all the guns and police officer's suit. I was the damn law then.Forever kudos for RWS for creating series like Postal. I will always like video games that are kicking people decrying games and their brutality in the balls, baiting them to write another article about how the video games are bad.Postal 2 Complete is a bit renewed version of basic game. These few additions are pleasant and are making the game more modern. I have minor performance issues, and i miss the Polish dubbing, but hell, it's Postal. Goin' Postal."

I've only played it for almost 15 hours, and I still love the game.You start off being the ""Postal Dude"", doing things like getting milk, or cashing in a check(Which you have to be on line and wait, or just kill them all and get the money in a safe). The game even has Steam Workshop now, which will make the game even more fun.

It is the best 'bad' game I've ever played.You won't get any deeper meanings from the plot. But it is funny, which is something that is a hard to boast for most videogames.Is the gunplay good? No. But the feeling of blowing someone's head to bits with a shotgun in Postal 2 is completely unmatched.Open world? Surprisingly yes. Although the map is small, this game allows freedom of which I have yet to see matched. Every action you do creates a completely logical action, through either the cops looking to arrest you or the owner of the home that you barged in on looking to kill you.I bought this game on super sale and I will definitely say that it is worth the price. Plus, the game has a multiplayer and expansion to the story that wasn't even originally included for free.10/10"

It almost feels like I'm advocating heinous actions.Postal 2 is... strange. I thought it was a great game, filled with little nooks and crannies for you to explore. The world is filled with tools of destruction for you (from typical shotguns and assault rifles to spray cans, lighters, and throwing scissors) at your disposal. The law enforcement isn't overbearing, it could actually be a little tougher. The game's basic premise is doing mundane tasks that go awry almost every time. It's fun to experiment with the weapons and environment, and it can be funny at times.At times.Most of the time, however, the ""humor"" in the game is disgusting and overbearing. I'd be completely honest saying that almost all of the signs and billboards in the game are bawdy double entendres. Groups of people are severely stereotyped (Muslims suicide bomb a church and take over; they spend the rest of the game attacking you with explosives and suicide charges while yelling ""ALLAHU AKBAR"").  If you're a fan of that kind of humor, though, or otherwise don't mind, I'd seriously consider buying this game."

,Recommended,223470,13687523,"Posted: 29 December, 2014",all,cheesecake,"Postal 2. A game created in 2003. It is sort of like GTA, but more brutal, less spohisticated weapons, hilarious items, a weird storyline, peeing on everything and a crazy character who dresses in a long black leather coat, wearing sunglasses and red hair and a goatee. For anyone looking for something brutal to waste your time, this is a game for you. For anyone who likes to chop peoples' heads off and throw sledgehammers at them, this is the game for you. For anyone who likes driving cars and running over people, this is not the game for you. Even stated in the game on Wednesday, cars are useless in the game, the only use for them, are to blow them up. Even that doesn't get you many kills *snicker* . But this game does state logic (more or less) and sheer craziness, with hilarious achievements, such as'We Got Green Greenlit Anyway', the achievement where you kill someone after they decline to sign your petition. Another + is that there are so many weapons in this game! ranging fromshovels to machine guns to hedge trimmers!. The game feature's different modes! Even aZombie mode!In a nutshell:If brutally murdering people and free roam is your thing, i suggest you get the game now. Like, literally, now.Oh, and Happy new year to anyone reading this between 29 December 2014 and 1 January 2015 :D xD"
