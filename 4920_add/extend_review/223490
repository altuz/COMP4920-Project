They are from a version of the game that will not be developed further. The realistic look is gone. Apparently the developer couldn't figure out how to make that work properly and instead of hiring help, he's scrapping it entirely. The local evangelists will tell you it will still be available, but it needs a lot of development to reach a playable state, so that will not happen now.The version that is now under development will look sort of like Mario64, see the project's webpage or the developer's twitter for screenshots of that. If that is what you want to like to build your creations in, then by all means get this game (or better yet, wait for it to be updated to an actually playeble state). I was lured in by the false pretenses of the realistic look and the new version is not the game I'd thought I was buying. Therefore, a big thumbs down from me."

This review is starting to read like a diary, and I think its time to pack it in and move on from blockscape.Why you ask?Simply put.. Blockscape is hailed as being the ""ultimate block buliding game"".  Unfortunately, by the time this game is remotely near playable and feature inclusive, there will be so so SO many other voxel sandbox games out there that are more current and better designed.Why continue to wait around for BS when you can literally Sandbox (as a verb) in:SpaceMediaveal TimesPost-apocalytic zombie nightmarespixelated retro worlds2D platform worlds3D open worldsRight now, the only future promise i see in Blockscape that isnt currently being surpassed by other games is its graphical quality... however with the focus moving away from the publicised ""smoothworld"" to a more blocky algorithym, combined with the extremely slow development time will leave this game dull and visually antiquated by the time it breaks out of alpha.Goodnight blockscape hoepfuls, and good luck! I'm done holding my breath!--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------UPDATE 01/23/15It's surprising how a few quick words from the developer in the forums can turn an entire community around.  Jens (the developer) has been opening up a bit and discussing with us the silence that has been turning the forums toxic for months.  I think I need to upgrade my review to guardedly-hopeful.  Though we have not yet seen an update, the sudden reappearance of Jens (as well as an acknowledgement and apology) in the forums has defused a lot of the once-tension and given many of us back the hope we had when seeing this amazing program for the first time.If we get screenshots or an update in the coming weeks that make the game a bit more playable I'll for sure change my review to ""reccomend"", but for now I still can't say its worth it if what you're looking for is a polished game.  If you're looking for the ability to get in on the ground floor of an amazing gmae and make suggestions that may influence its design, then things are starting to look much better!------------------------------UPDATE 12/25/14Taking a break from my three children on Christmas to post a few words (see Jens, this ISNT hard)Jens gave a lackluster post earlier this month about how he ""felt he had to"" release an update by Christmas.  No promise, and absolutely no excitement in him about it.Well it's Christmas (after Christmas in Sweeden actually) and the ""Update"" we recieved was a picture of a sled on the blockscape main page.The little bit of hope I had died today on Christmas.  Thanks Jens.I'm calling this Vaporware until the dev. proves me wrong----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------UPDATE: 11/12/14Jens seems to have a new person doing part time PR on the forums now and has promised us daily updates on the blockscape main page.  I'll give him a point for the attempt to reach out, though those 'daily' updates are starting to grow less frequent, and the last one only served to show us that:A- Jens does indeed own a set of legos, andB- He can build monochrome landscapes with themNot that I don't appreciate him at least trying, but aside from his afinity for tiny plastic building blocks and a few screenshots of a supposedly revamped lighting system... we're still not getting any real information and certainly no interaction.  This has the oily feeling of abandonware where the dev pops up from time to time with a meaningless update just to prove its still in production. (Castle Story, Spacebase-DF9, etc)I'm still recommending that people stay away until we see at least one code update (with significant bug fixes and user issues adressed).---------------------------------------------------------------------------Until Jens is willing to grace his user base with a post, information, or just any basic interaction.. I have to reccomend that you stay away from this game.  we were promised involvement and community interaction, but if you want to see how well that has played out, just have a look in the forums for this game.  Not one devlog post since Steam EA, no interaction with the community, and not a single update of substance (both in programming or simple comments).Many of us simply cannot play the game- I'd say at least 30% of us are experiencing memory leaks so severe that the game will crash every time after no more than 5 minutes.  This specific problem has existed since before the steam release, but as of yet Jens has not even acknowledged the issues, let alone given us info on it.These communcation problems have begun to turn Jens supporters against him.... every day I watch the rating on Steam go down just a little more due to negative reviews.  I could turn this review into a 3 page rant, but I wont... if you're on the fence about buying this game, please go and read some of the forum posts before you make up your mind!"

Absolutely amazing, realistic landscape and the ability to create extremely high detail structures. Why wouldn't I recommend it you ask? because not only has the developer continued to work on the game completely solo (resulting in about 6 months of no updates, he has now also decided to completely change the game from the smooth and realistic perfection that it was, to a fully block-based game that just looks like an uglier version of minecraft. Apparently this is because lego is his passion or some rubbish like that. I guess he must really like his lego if he's prepared to lose the 95% of players who bought the game because of it's realism... oh and then watch his ""passion"" dissolve into nothing because he set himself up to compete with minecraft.If you couldn't tell I (like many others) am rather unhappy about this. I spent 50 hours in game on one project which is now going to be ruined.DO NOT BUY THIS GAME."

This will plainly not be finished and is in an unacceptable/unplayable state.It started out pretty good, went in an optimistic and fairly promising direction, but when that looked like too much work/too complicated to the dev he didn't get help, instead fell further in over his head & hasn't gotten out.The dev needs to either hire some help, or have the honesty to admit to everyone that this thing got well beyond his abilities/desire to finish & just call it. Seriously, don't be yet another EA dev that goes out like this- admit it's not working, admit you don't want to finish this, or can't finish it- and just pull this thing offline.

BUT the fact that nothing has been released for us to test etc is bugging me and I still stand by my original post... game has not been updated for just over 9 months since I posted my original review.STOP! READ THIS BEFORE YOU BPURCHASE!!!THIS GAME HAS NOT BEEN UPDATED IN 2 MONTHS. Today is the 2 Sep 2014.I have posted several tweets and messages to the developer of this game which have been deleted. There have been no updates what so ever on steam or the original site which was created.All I can see this game doing is stealing peoples cash just so the dev can live easy.The game is buggy and horrible to play for long periods of time, crashes heaps.please reconsider before you purchase, the videos sucked me in too, its not what you think guys!UPDATED A YEAR LATER (15/10/2015)Soooo, thinking that there might have actually been some work done on this and progress coming along nicely... I looked at the news to find 2 more community updates and a few screenshots.This developer is a fraud and has stolen the money off of hundreds of people.UPDATED JUST OVER A YEAR LATER (11/1/2017)Hi guys,Well I'm here once again reviewing this game. I just downloaded it and spent less than 15 minutes playing it to discover that over the year+ I have been gone the developer has removed and changed a tonne of content and not for the better.I thought I would give the game another chance as there had been quite a few good reviews for it lately and to my surprise a few updates that sounded promising. But once again I discovered that it has minimal content and it had its once half decent terrain changed into a minecraft look alike with more edges.Not only that the crafting system is disgusting, for 5 of those 15 minutes I was trying to work out how the inventory opened and how it workek to try and craft a tool, that I then had to figure out how to use. Once I got sick of this I decided to run to the house that had been generated close. After entering the building my eyes were attacked with a hard to see grey fuzz like looking under murky water.I simply cannot recommend this game once again, it had so much promise and sadly the developer just cannot do it, 3 + years I have had this game and been waiting for something good to come of it and all that was added that was actually a good addition were the sounds.If you're looking for an open world survival/building/crafting game that is voxel seriously get minecraft, 1000 times better and can be modded."

However, the controls are still very clunky and lack intuitiveness.  The game overall runs much smoother, however I have recently upgraded my computer and the improved performance may be due to that fact.  The other major detracting feature of the game is itslackof features.  There doesn't seem, at this time, much to do other than build and gather resources.  There is no apparent threat and as a result, there is little motivation to build or craft anything without some impetus.  Fun features include gathering and building with clouds, building on clouds, and a vast world to explore that really feels like itshouldbe alive and teeming, but isn't.Overall, I still can't recommend the game, but it seems the dev is really working to improve the game, if at averyslow pace.  After playing the game at regular intervals, it has become clear this is a labor of love for this dev and if you want to support this project buy the game.  However, Blockscape has a long way to go,years, so don't expect it to be finished anytime soon.UPDATE 3/20/2016:Some good news as far as this game is concerned.  The world generation is looking better than ever.  The textures are gorgeous and the general shaping and appearance of the world have become surprisingly organic.  But, the controls, opaque gameplay and poor optimization are still major issues.  Also, it appears the preconstructed castles and towers are a thing of the past.  That's pretty disappointing.  I will update again in about a year.UPDATE 01/05/2015:Still no update...  Seriously?  If this game ever gets updated, I will rewrite my review, but as it stands I feel cheated.ORIGINAL REVIEW 12/4/2014:There are so many things wrong with this game.I am honestly convinced the developer has stopped support (it's never been updated since I've owned it).  If I had to choose one game in my library to kick myself over, this would be it.  I was desperate to find an in-depth and attractive voxel/building game.  I snagged this up right after seeing the screenshots and trailer.Optimization for this game is♥♥♥♥♥♥poor in it's current state.  It suffers from constant stuttering and a distinct inability to minimize the window.  Minimizing the window wouldn't be such a big deal if the game had a decent tutorial or any tutorial.  The UI is confusing to learn and clunky once understood.  There is a hunger mechanic (I think), but it diminishes so slowly it makes no difference (Apparently, there are some animals to kill or something.There's an occasional bird.).  Gathering resources is a pain, especially trees.  And, there seems to be no real incentive to get AI characters as they are buggy and pretty much useless.I can say this game has a great amount of potential.  And, is an ambitious endeavor.  It has beautiful graphics.  The idea of pre-constructed castles/towers is cool and adds a mystifying element to the world.  Should the developer ever continue this project, it could be an amazing experience.I just wish it was better.EDIT:After reading some of the other reviewers, I checked out the developers website.  There is progress being made, but none of it is yet released.  The developer may release a new build before Christmas.  Still, there really should be more frequent updates. I've had this game for months now, and that's too long to wait for an update (Call me fickle/demanding, but I feel like I should be able to see what and where I've invested my money)."
,Not Recommended,223490,11870006,"Posted: 26 August, 2014",all,The Crazy Zonie,"1 May, 2016 - Since Jens is updating the game again and supposedly hes started from the ground up, I thought I would give his game another look.TL;DR - Like Dark Horse, I still vote ""Neigh"". Spend your money elsewhere.- He did fix the juming issues when moving to new areas/chunks.- Realistic still renders a lovely world, from a distance. Textures seemed to take a step back when viewed up close.- Clipping still a major issue. Now both Blockscape and Realistic modes will also jump the avatar to the next highest cliff/elevation when running into a wall. Falling through cracks still a problem.- Tools still cumbersome/unwieldy to use.- Load times are better, but only marginally.ORIGINAL REVIEWLong Story Short: This game isn't ready for primetime, and the Dev doesn't understand the difference between ""proof of concept"", Alpha, and Beta releases. This game is borderline proof of concept stage, maybe early alpha release. And it's not worth the $20 USD (or your regional equivalent). I am suffering from Buyer's Remorse.What I had hoped was this game would be the answer to the question that Minecraft poses: Can someone make a voxel sandbox game that allows for a realistic world built from unique (non-blocky) shapes. The videos that the Dev has posted on YouTube seem to say this game has the possibility of answering that question. But not in its current state.Pros:-The graphics are great. Don't get me wrong, the rendered world looks fabulous, and so does the buildings built in this world.-The Dev is on the right track with his User Interface. Reducing the voxel size (to 1/64th of what Mojang uses) and using a pallet and brush approach to paint the voxels onto the world canvas is the right direction. Tools still need work, but this is the right direction.-The generated castles (while not really built like castles) are neat structures to explore.Cons:-The underlying engine isn't there yet. It needs a lot more work before this title can claim Alpha status, let alone Beta status:- Game randomly crashes to desktop.- Game randomly throws up ""Game Over"" screen with no indication something was going wrong or why the game ended.- Game randomly hangs. Whole system freezes. Sometimes it recovers if let sit to stew long enough.- Game uses too many resources.- Game does a basic render and skin on the entire visible spot of the map, and only renders a small section around the player with the shading, skins, and textures. Screen twitches and jumps like a kid on a caffeine binge. Players will have to wait for the map to render the spot they moved to till the system renders the new location. This high definition render bubble is very small.- Object collision bugs leads to some rather interesting game play. (Example: Walking down the stairs can lead the player to get stuck between floors, as the system only tests collision on feet and head.)-There is very little help available. Players are expected to figure out everything.- The only help provided in game is a list of basic controls. (And this is missing a few of the vital controls. Expect key smashing to find the hidden features.)- There is very little text for objects in the game that can clue a player into tasks. All of the tabs are blank, and most of the objects have just a name and what resources are required to make them. There is nothing to help players figure out how to use most of the objects.- Unless I'm mistaken, there is very little documentation online to help the player along. Even the wiki site for the game seems to be a half abandoned after thought.-Most of the user interface menus are half built. Many are missing navigation prompts (Hint: ESC backs out of most, but not all screens.) In-game menus also do not appear to be well formatted.-Text in game can be quite small for large resolutions. Font choice doesn't help either.-Features are not as far along as the Dev lists on his web site and on the Steam page.-The tools are still a bit clunky to use.At this point, if you are considering buying this game: Only buy it if you wish to help the developer along and you can catch it on sale for $5 USD. If spending half your play time fighting bugs and reporting them in the boards does not sound fun, same your money and buy Minecraft instead. (It's only $7 USD more, and further along in its development cycle.) The game in its current state would have been good to use as a demo for a KickStarter campaign, but it should never have been released on Steam. I fear his rush to make money off this game will actually discourage people from buying it once it's polished and playable. I doubt many people who play Blockscape can actually recommend it.I do not wish to discourage the Dev. I can see the general direction he wishes to go with this game, and it is a good one. If this were more polished product that was further long the development path, it could stand to be a challenger to Mojang and Minecraft. I welcome him to contact me about the comments I made here."

I mean the developer has been a bit more active.. but that is all that has changed, and even then it has been more recent then something that changed a while ago. People say ""lay the dev a break."" Sure, I will, once he decides to actually update a game. You see, when you charge MONEY, 20 dollars, for your game (Which may not seem like a lot depending on how wealthy you are) I expect to get my damn money's worth and for the developer to keep his promises that he sold the game to everyone on. This game has a hell of a lot of promise. But again, I am review the current game, not the update that is promised and not the promise this game has, I am reviewing it based on how I played it and how the developer is currently. But hey if I have anything good to say, the music is amazing. That is about it.""Don't mix Clay with legos""Then why did you do it to begin with?Personally I got this game back in July 2014 (Thanks Vitamin PAIN for the correction) during the Summer Sale (which seemed to be the death of many EA games, Vox, Blockscape [This Game], and a few others whose names currently escape me). I was EXCITED AS HELL! The huge beautiful world that puts Minecraft's ""Mountains"" to shame and the ability to build what could be a huge city that actually looks like something feasable in the real world. Now, I didn't have any problems with running the game, and from what I have read I was one of the lucky few. The world the game takes place in is imense. Not counting the non-existant Cave Systems and lack of mobs, the world looks great. The colorful graphics and cartoony textures looks fantastic. After a few hours of playing you realize that this nice world is only the cover of something worse.I have been aware of this game since 2012. Some people calling it a ""Minecraft killer"" with what seemed to be an entirally flat world, it was impressive then and still impressive now. Recently he seems to be taking it away. YES YES YES, He has said that ""Features will be added to both world types"" which is cool I guess, but you also have to take into account that this ""Flat world"" that he is adding is supposed to, in his words, ""Make adding features to the world a breeze"" . Common knowledge would lead anyone to realize that ""OH HEY, maybe just maybe having two world types for survival may make adding features more of a challenge"" which the many defenders of this game seem to not realize.The developer is the DEFINITION of inactive, his twitter is filled with screenshots of something that he promised to bring a while back, and others are more what I call ""junk tweets"" for a dev which includes him talking about the wonders of Driver lineses. I have nothing against those posts but if you intend on people taking your work and game seriously and what them to think you haven't entirally abandoned the game you probaly should post only about the advancements of the game instaed of about your everyday life when you are not, not coding your game that people over the course of 2 years have spent 20 dollars on. People say ""he is a one man team so give him a break!"" As surprising as it may be Notch, who made Minecraft, was a one man coding team for over a year! (2009-2010) and brought constant updates, yes you could say ""Its been over 2 years with constant updates and now he has stopped"" but you are missing the fact that this game is FAR from feature filled as Minecraft was at that point and time. Out of the 30 months it took Minecraft to become released in 2011, Blockscape is about at where Minecraft was in September... 2009. This becomes an increasing problem when you realize that about the first year of Minecraft's exsistance was just Notch testing what would and wouldn't work in a voxel survival game (which was in its infancy at the time) but Jens has had that groundwork that Notch has publicly shown everyone over his development so that makes it even less of an excuse for this game to still be this far behind in development, it appears that Jens has bitten off more then he could chew in this case.Speaking of biting off more then he could chew, Jens (The developer) said ""Don't Mix Clay with legos"" talking about the flat world in comparison to the new blocky, shapy world. Ok, if that is your saying of the day (he made a blog post where he said that phrase about 5 times) then why did it take you so long to realize that? Why until now did you think that everything was perfect.I hope that this game does come back from the grave with a vengence, however I do not have a big feeling with all of the complaints that are active. If he does come back and actually decides to make a game instead of jerking around then I will be happy to make a reivew. However, I find it kind of hard to make a positive review of a game whose biggest feature is ""It runs on PCs Sometimes""Oh and a side note don't believe anything the store page tells you, ""I Will never abandon this game!""...One year later and still nothing."

Very badly.I don't know why people rage so hard over this game. It's still everything it ever was. It still looks like the screenshots. The one and only problem is the dev team is one man, so progress is about as slow as you'd expect. People take it so personally and have toddler tantrums. Chill out.Yes it's made zero progress for a very long time, and will probably never make any more progress. Why? Because people stopped buying it, thus funding the development. Why? Because everyone loves to complain and hate, leading to an overflow of negative reviews.The haters killed the sales, which made them hate it even more... well done.Is it a good building game? Yes. Best I've ever played in terms of detail. It's also full of game breaking bugs. You can build some amazing things, if the game doesn't crash on you. There are ways to avoid it, like don't place blocks down too quickly, but yes, sooner or later you'll suddenly be looking at the desktop. And no, you haven't saved it for hours, so goodbye to all the progress you made today.That happend to me several times. After the 3rd or 4th crash I walked away. Awesome game, progress destroying crashes.Works 99% better than Landmark. 99% worse than Minecraft.If the game never crashed, it'd be amazing. But it crashes. All the time.The only big remaining problem is the world generation. The biomes are tiny and consist mostly of snowy mountains and barren rock/dirt areas, and tiny little patches of green here and there. What you end up with is a patchwork of mostly barren mountainous landscape. The biomes just need to be 100 times bigger, then this game would be the best game ever.That's the foundation it needed. From there it would have been onwards and upwards, getting better all the time. But, for whatever reason, it just sat there. People got angry and now think it's the work of the devil, and that the dev is a scamer or worse, because people are childish. I'm sure this went a long way in making the developer walk away, as people had decided to rage and hate and join the band wagon of flames because they like being part of the tribe.This game is infinitely better than the crazy torch wielding mob would have you believe.So what's the bottom line?If you want to build buildings in a game with the highest level of detail yet achieved in a game (that I've seen), and don't mind having to remember to save it as often as possible for fear of crashing, then this is the game for you.This worked for me for a while. But if you're getting into it and are excited about a new idea you've just had, and you're really keen to try it out to see if it works and looks good... which gets you into it even more because now that you can see it coming together, you're getting more ideas about how it can look even better and !!>>CRASH<<!!..........You didn't save any of that did you? You haven't saved in half an hour, have you? You haven't been keeping up with your saves... yeah... that's all gone now.Sometimes that wasn't a big deal. But once or twice, I just lost my masterfully done staircase (or something) that I've been racking my brain over for hours and had finally came up with a design that fits perfectly in the room and looks way better than I was imagining. That hurts. Makes it hard to keep trying.Fix the crashes and this would get a soild thumbs up from me. However, it crashes like a drunken baby attempting to fly a 747 with his/her lips. It's fun on the way down though."

The developer has made promises of updates, but so far nothing has occurred. The last promised update was to occur before Christmas; but here it is a month later and not only has there been no update, there has been no word from the developer.  Since the last update we have seen pictures of him on holiday with his family, pictures of his building block collection, and promises to roll up his sleeves and get to work - but we have seen no update!DO NOT BUY BLOCKSCAPE!There are only two possibilitiies: This is a case of consumer fraud or it is not. If it isn't, then the developer, who is but one person, has bitten off more than he can chew, and either lacks the financial capital, the skill, or both, to go any further with development.  In either case, purchaeing Blockscape would be a waste of money.ORIGINAL REVIEW - October 3, 2014Even though I've only played Blockscape for 3 hours, that is enough to have experienced all it has to offer.  Blockscape is reminiscent of Minecraft, there is no denying that.  Does that make it a Minecraft clone? No, not yet.  Will it be?  That remains to be seen, but from what I've seen so far, I don't think so.What I likeThe graphics.It's a very beautiful looking *ahem* game.The building.Blockscape offers many different shapes and sizes of blocks, so it's possible to build some very nice-looking structures.  Likewise, because you can also carve so many different sizes of blocks from the landscape, it is possible to sculpt many nice-looking things.The bugs.The only bugs I've found in Blockscape so far are crawling around on the ground.  The programming seems very solid, and the developer seems to have spent a great deal of time making sure everything works as opposed to simply cramming new content into something that is a buggy, unplayable mess.What I don't likeWell.... it would be unfair to list what I don't like here because what I don't like actually falls into the next category...What I would like to seeMore options.Key binding.  I'm left handed, and I can't stand using WASD.Volume control.  The music is loud enough to drown out my friends on TeamSpeak.Mouse sensitivity. I would like to turn this down. My mouse jumps all over the place.Intuitive UI.  I spent much of my 3 hours poking around the keyboard just to see what was what.VerdictAt the moment, this is a game that I would play merely as a casual game.  Something I can go to when I've got a few minutes to kill at a time, not something I would devote hours of game time to.  If you can pick it up for $5, go for it, but I cannot recommend it at $19.99 at this time."

I will inform you why that is, and why I do recommend the game.First some history (not long, don't bail now, I know history can be boring to some people!). Blockscape was going very far, had a beautiful world, and was just wonderful to look at. Well, eventually the game got too overwhelming for the solo developer (Jens Blomquist) to keep going for a while, and he took a break. He wanted to figure out where the game was going to go. During this period the reviews started to shoot down because the game was being labeled as abandoned. But it actually wasn't. He just got overwhelmed, being alone in this project and having such an advanced type of game (I know voxel programming some, and it is not easy in the slightest). So after roughly a year and a half, he released Blockscape's biggest update. Made the game a completely new game. Now the reviews are still bad, but he is actually releasing great updates weekly. The reviews are starting to go up. We can make them go higher if we try because he has found the right path now!On to the game's review itself.Blockscape is a wonderful looking world of creativity. The survival elements are not there yet, at least not all the way, but the creative elements are great. You can build amazing things, with loads of shapes, materials, and even 3 sizes of every block. You can build large structure with Minecraft sized blocks, and then add major detail with tiny bite-sized blocks! All shapes (cubes, slopes, corners, other weird shapes) come in the 3 sizes, and you can even turn off the grid snap! The graphics are fantastic in my opinion. The gameplay is now solid, there are nowhere near as many bugs now as there used to be, and all kinds of things are being updated and improved regularly.Now for some pros and cons;PROS:-Graphics - The graphics are great. They look nice and give a good style to the game to make it unique (my opinion)-Gameplay - The gameplay, while not loaded with oodles of content, is still fun. It can be a little tricky to get the hang of, but still good.-Building - The building in this game, according to me, is much better than building in Minecraft or 7DtD, etc. The amount of detail you can get into is amazing.-Loads of materials, block shapes, and building tools - The title of this 'pro' says it all.-Developer Communication - He is very good about responding to posts and questions.CONS:-GUI - Needs improvement. I like the way that your tools are handled with one hotbar and materials with another, that is fine, but what is hard to get used to is the way the GUI works. It is a bit un-intuitive, but not horrible.-Multiplayer - It is not very easy to setup, though this one is kind of just my problem, other people have no problems, so this one you can ignore. You have to port forward, and sometimes it crashes, but that could just be me, not sure. It is early access after all.-Price - While I love this game, I do think the price is a bit high. Maybe 10-15 would be better for now.MIXED (Good and Bad):-Bugs/Performance - The performance, while still relatively slow, is much better than it used to be. It has some bugs here and there, but also nowhere near as bad as it used to be. After playing for 1 to 2 hours (depending on your machine of course, those are numbers according to my PC) it starts to delay when you build. You click, 1-2 seconds later, the block is placed. This is not always the case, but it does happen.So overall, yes I recommend this game. Now that you know the history of 'why' this has a bad review, it is up to you to decide if you want this game. Remember, bad reviews because he took a break, lost the ""sight"" of the game, but now he has gained it back and the game is doing great. So does he really deserve a bad review still? He has fixed those things that made the community upset with him. So, choose wisely young one.Jens, if you read this, thank you for making this game. I read your last News Post, and I hope it doesn't come to that and I hope this review helps the rating go up. I am happy you have such a passion to complete this game, and I wish you the best of luck."

There were some ideas that did not turn out well, but the developer is re-focused and is delivering many updates and fixes.The engine is now running really smoothly and I can non longer find any bad meshing. The art-style is coherent with the game's name :). There are many ""voxel"" games out there that envy the rendering range with such detail at long distance. You can see what you build a very long way.The block size is small compared to other similar games and therefore you can do accurate and nice looking building with all the possible shapes and materials that you can use.The responsivness of the game is really great!

Right now it isn't so much a game as it is a sculpture/map editor, with alot of map no-clipping. My most major complaint is that this game is $20. I personally think the game should have been in development a little longer before having it exposed to the public, and that the controls need to be better labeled. I found randomly pressing buttons on the keyboard gave me more information on how the game works than the 'help' option did. I see the potential, but I'm not sure if this title will make good on its promises. It has a good world generator it seems, with some ruins and trees to find. But you're better off generating a flat world and trying out the controls to give it a more fair evaluation.However, at this point I feel like the project could go either way. Consider it more a donation than a purchase at this point in time."

Unless it sells enought to hire someone else (which I doubt it has), then it's all up to one person. Think about that. Even if he hires a developer right out of school with little experience and on contract, he's still going to shell out $40k-$60k a year. To do that, he needs to have made enough to cover his own expenses PLUS those additional wages PLUS taxes. Even if you run at a loss, you can't do it forever with your business. Eventually the tax man cometh.So the guy needs to sell, conservatively, $130k or so of the product to fund a year. That would be about 6000 copies at full retail. Unfortunately he doesn't get full retail. Steam takes a cut, as does the reduced margin anytime it's on sale (which is probably the majority of unit sales). A little research says Valve takes about 30%. This gives us a floor of 8,500 copies at full retail. When we factor in discounts, it's likely he needs to sell 15-20k copies PER YEAR.Based on the fact that there are only 690 reviews, and they are mostly negative. With games that generate that kind of passion more likely to get reviewed than mediocre games, it seems unlikely that more than 10k units have been sold. In fact, the trustworthy internet tells us that the average Steam title only sells 32k copies in its lifetime!http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2015-06-19-the-average-game-on-steam-sells-only-32-000-copiesI think it's safe to say that it would be tough for Jens to fund a team right now and the only way to make his vision, which is really cool, a reality, is to be supportive and encourage sales.This project has potential and I really hope it bears fruit.

So far, all you do is basically go around and collect resources and make items.  There doesn't seem much point in game at all.  It's a survivor-type game, but it's pretty hard to die.  I've only found you die from drowning and falling, though you might also die from starving (not sure yet).  Speaking of death, food is hard to come by, which keeps you alive and lets your NPC work for you.  I have an NPC, but they never did anything that I could tell (even before they were hungry), but I'm sure that is just my fault.  The game crashes a lot and has a lot of glitches.  It would be nice if they posted updates more often.  They need to add a compass, altimeter, GPS, minimap, an overall map and resource map (or be able to make notes on map).  I was mining in search of gold and went really deep and got disorientated and dug for hours without finding my way out (had to cheat and use code to teleport out).  They need to make game more interesting, add more content, more types of resources and different requirements to obtain them (leveling).  It would be nice to see physics work...  a bit wierd to cut a tree in half and have the top half still standing (same with rocks staying in midair), though I understand this would probably be too difficult to implement.  Hostile mobs have been mentioned as an update as well as trading with NPCs.  That would help a lot, but honestly they need to do a lot more.  I see a lot of potential in this game, but it's too boring and needs a ton of work currently.  I feel it's overpriced a lot.  I recently bought Lantern Forge for $10 and it's a fairly similar game, but I find it much more enjoyable, though it too gets boring after a bit.  I personally think Blockscape would be stretching it to charge $10 for this game (in present state).  I think the game looks good, but I would much rather play a game that is enjoyable as to one that looks good.  Hopefully, they'll make it more enjoyable soon."
,Recommended,223490,33319555,Posted: 6 July,all,josh771,"= On the Negativity =I'm afraid you'll find a lot of negative reviews for this game that seem to be based solely on some broken promises from years back - I can say nothing of either side of the dispute, really. The game had been using a smoother, more ""realistic"" world model and this was what people paid for. I can understand being a bit miffed with something like that, and I wasn't there, so I don't know what kind of senseless drama may have unfolded, but...I also can't imagine holding a $20 grudge for 5 years because of a video game. It's a game, people. Putting that aside...Now, I am a new purchaser who bothered to read the Positive Reviews and see what the substance of these reviews might reveal. I looked at the screenshots a couple of times, saw the game was on sale (although $10 is already a fair enough price for the content), and I went for it.= Survival Mode is Poor, Creative Mode is Fantastic =Let me say, if you're looking for a fully fleshed-out survival experience, you want something else. I believe this game will eventually offer some survival gameplay comparable to other ""Minecraft-like"" titles, but it is rather limited for now.Where this game shines is in its ""Just Build"" mode. If you have long enjoyed creating buildings in other voxel-based games but found that the voxels themselves were a little too large or undetailed, you might be pleasantly surprised by this game. It has a small voxel resolution and a good selection of shapes to choose from, including slopes of varying steepness, corners (inside and out), bevels, bars, and more. The slopes are dynamically flipped based on your viewing angle, so putting slopes under staircases, etc. is handy enough - no worse than Minecraft's dynamic stair flipping.The utility of the blocks is only fully realized when you combine the many available shapes with the available materials. The same shape one might use to make small wooden window panes can just as easily create a stylish steel portcullis. You just have to keep in mind the possibilities with the 2-part block system - there are very few shape-to-material incompatibilities here. I have already enjoyed building a log cabin with an outdoor covered forge - was able to place nice support beams with angles unavailable in blockier games - and a small stone fortress with a very nice arched gate and portcullis.= No Tutorial, No Problem =The controls, I will confess, take some effort to learn, but it's hardly the end of the world. I was able to find a handy control and console command reference just by bringing up Steam Overlay in-game and checking the Community Guides. A little bit of expermentation for a few play sessions should greatly increase your understanding of the gameplay as well, depending on the plasticity of the individual brain. I personally kept clicking the wrong mouse buttons for block placement/removal (they're inverted from traditional Minecraft, and there are no keybinds). So far, I only get better the more I play. Don't let the controls bog you down - you're not learning to play Dwarf Fortress here.= Not Realistic, But Still Beautiful =Graphically, I love how far the view distance goes and the fact that the voxels don't ever seem to be missing in the distance. They load in at different levels of detail, allowing for fairly seamless exploration without noticeable pop-ins and the like. There are shadows cast by sunlight and there are colored lighting options. And I've already mentioned the voxel resolution, but you can also paint blocks with a decent palette of colors - or even paint them with other materials like moss or soil.= Performance at a Glance =The game runs with a smooth framerate with all settings on High. My rig has 8 GB RAM, an AMD FX-8350 Eight-Core Processor running at 4 GHz, and an nVidia GeForce GTX 970, for the curious. I only have roughly 10 hrs in game at the writing of this review, but I have so far not encountered any crashes or game-breaking bugs, although I've heard of them. I have encountered a few ""ghost"" voxels that do not vanish after I harvest them in survival mode, but this resolved itself when I left the area and returned.= In Summary =1) There are a lot of people who hate this game, but their reasons are more personal and have less to do with the game's current content and quality. I won't rule out that there are obviously people who probablydohate the game's content as-is, and they're free to have that opinion. Just know that the majority seems to be a personal gripe with the dev.2) Survival mode isn't worth the purchase, so look elsewhere if that's your thing. Creative mode is most definitely worth the purchase, so grab this up if you want to make beautiful voxel-based structures and you're tired of using the coarser resolution of blocks that certain other games use.3) This game will not teach you how to play, but it is not too hard to discover through the Steam Community Guides or probably just by a quick Google search. As with any game, using the controls and features often enough will get you in the swing of things regardless of the lack of tutorial.4) The graphics, as they are, are very pleasant and seem to be well optimized. Not the best thing I've ever seen, but I have very little to complain about. You can make some beautiful stuff with this game.5) The game seems to perform well 10 hrs in, but I can't be certain without more play time. Just know that you're purchasing an Early Access Game that seems to be developed by a lone developer, so either turn and walk the other way or cut the guy some slack. You should know there is always an element of risk in buying EA, so reserve your torches and pitchforks for the big-name AAA developers.For $10? I'd give this game maybe a 7/10. I got it at a slight discount, so I'm more inclined to give it an 8/10 from that standpoint."

,Recommended,223490,33009065,Posted: 29 June,all,Joshua724,"6/29/2017I was looking for an alternative to Minecraft. Mainly because I got tired of, every time Minecraft got updated, having to update all my mods. It was a good proof of concept. However, now that game design and computers in general have gotten more advanced, now’s a good time for something to succeed it.Obviously, there’s the fact that Blockscape uses voxels for terrain sculpting. However, whereas Minecraft used polygon rendering to display voxels, Blockscape uses actual voxels, which allows for unique geometric shapes. You would not believe how enjoyable it is to make something without having to use squares.I’d say my main complaint is the mobs. With Minecraft, if you killed a bad mob, you don’t have to worry about it for a while. Furthermore, there are conditions that have to be met for the mobs to spawn. The mobs in Blockscape are almost ridiculous. There’s one bug that’s, basically, a portal with legs. Wasps will spawn from that. Multiple wasps if they start attacking you. I tried knocking out as many of the wasps as I could to get to the portal. But, too many came out. There are, also, worms that work like termites. The moment I put down a workbench, worms were coming out of the woodworks to engulf it. I tried the “killall” command to stop them. But, they just kept coming. Furthermore, I could attack them but, unlike Minecraft where mobs would get knocked back, attacking mobs didn’t stop them. They just slowed down a little and kept attacking you while you tried attacking them.As for other bugs, I'll admit I had problems every now and them placing a block. If I wanted to put up a window in my house, I had to put a single block down to be able to put the window at the angle I wanted. Sometimes, I couldn't place a window in my house at all. Also, even with the windows up, the worms were able to get through anyways.My suggestion is dial down on the bad mobs so that the gameplay experience is much more enjoyable. Also, can you make it so that bad mobs can't just go through a window if you put something up to block it?"

The smaller blocks allow for much finer details and the angled block lets you make a nice smooth roof, instead of a roof that looks like stairs.

It looked amazing before however it looks just as good now and despite what people are saying I think it's still a really good game both visually and mechanically. The main reason I got Blockscape was because it's like graphics porn. It looks amazing and the stuff you can build on it is phenomenal!! Even though it's still in Early Access you can already do so much with it I would certainly recommend it to anyone who wants to build super detailed structures that look absolutely incredible. Just look at some of the screenshots and you will see what I mean, pre and post update. I feel like it was worth what I paid for it and love going on it to show off to people how sexy everything looks and how much you can already do with it. 10/10"

I decided today to take a leap of faith on the game and honestly, This game is grea. For those who say its bad or its a ripoff of minecraft, Have probably never played minecraft ever. Ive had minecraft for 5 years almost and this game is nothing alike it. This game is easily played and yes its still in EA developing so bugs are expected.Only downside to this game, is I just got it and I have to goto work, so Im left not playing it. Sure people will say i only have 2 hours of playtime, But Ive been a steam user since 2009, So let them talk, I dont care. Its really up to you people who want to play the game to listen.This game is amazing, A new way of building, different shapes and sizes and different blocks added to this game, You can literally build anything in any way. For those who say a tutorial would be nice, Stop being lazy and look it up. It took me 5 secs on google and [w,a,s,d] - movement [space] - jump [f] - fly [n] - noclip. Off the top of my head, like seriously please try before writing a bad review of a great game.Honestly for 20$ I think Jen is doing great, I have already recommended this game to other gamers, and to the nay-sayers, this game is being advertised in gamestop. I think minecraft and tekkit are doomed and will completely drop to their knees for this game."

I'm getting 5-7 FPS on smallest screen size that works, clouds turned off, all settings as low as possible, with occasional bursts of 13 FPS after I hold still a bit. Movement feels like I'm standing on a boat. For example, I struggle to walk up stairs and to actually build anything was nearly impossible. After a few tries I gave up on trying to place stairs to make it easier to enter one of the generated (but gorgeous) structures.  I keep falling off things because I can't steer! Maybe with a serious gaming computer it would be playable. I'll try playing it again after the game is more optimized. For now I wish I hadn't bought it. You win some, you loose some.Pros: Looks gorgeous, tall mountains, nice terrainCons: Needs a really beefy computer. Needs a way to turn off some effects for better performance.

But a review is not a review without the ups and downs...First off, the game will not be able to run very well on a single_core CPU, I have one but I have seen lots of gameplay and played the game a little myself. You can choose between 2 different art styles; realistic, and blockscape. Realistic is self explanitory, blockscape worlds on the other hand are more artistic and cubic. Call the blockscape art style cubism if you want. there are a handfull of different materials in store, and a good amount of shapes for you to build amazing structures! Just look at what people have already built! I'm not that artistic and creative, but maybe you are. The world is very visually impressive, especially the realistic worlds. there are a few drawbacks though, the characters kinda look like maneqins making them sort of creepy. The game is also very slow to load in editable terrain. If you have a quad core processor, you should be fine.

,Not Recommended,223490,29643093,Posted: 1 February,all,Absolute Madman✨,"Blockscape is a building / survival game based around mining and building blocks that measure 6'' by 6'' by 6'' (looks like) to create a unique sandbox appeal. However, its early access state shows through like a laser through a tissue. A few glaring issues are abound, but the game is really a standout non-so-similar idea that the creator seems to have a confident approach towards. The responsive break and build system serves the game well enough, while the combat seems to lack excitement. That said, the AI for both neutral and enemy entities is basic and serves what purpose it needs to. All in all, it was not a fun game to play for me, but I can see how one day it will be. Now onto the pointers. Remember, the bad review stays regardless of my feelings. It is not up to par to be considered a continue play game.I redownloaded the game to give it another shot on the lowest possible settings* and although it worked, did not hold up well to criticism.      *My first playthrough had technical issues rendering it unplayable.Let's start with the negative...-UI is hard to read out, sometimes patterns used for some items are not the same to follow for others of similar status.-To Equip an item is a process that requires trial and error before coming about.- The lighting engine seems to die if you go too deep, it is as if you are in an open field.-AI sometimes fails to understand that there is a roof above their head, a table for eating, and a door that is indeed open or closed.-Unresponsive movement and combat with a lack of feedback allows a player asking if they really did attack the block, if they are moving, or if they took a hit. Audio cues notwithstanding.-Liquid physics are a bit jankey, they stopped working after a while and liquids would float in magic shapes suspended in the air, while other liquids would fall normally.-Lighting often bugged out for me, leaving me in darkness/purgatory (Everything is white with black backdrop)-Some items felt out of place, such as the ghosts from bugs being solid objects.-The gameplay feels robotic and unnatural, like lizard people who can do everyday life but lack the subtleties.Some positives-Still has nice lighting, when it is not breaking on me.-The amount of textures and sounds associated with said textures is a nice touch.-trelonist is a lonely ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ who has nothing better to do than annoy people.-The small scale of building is great for detail and to create what you really feel you want to."

A lot of people are unhappy about the state of the game and missing features that they were no doubt expecting when they bought this game.

Well despite the glitches and bugs (my game always starts rendered in 3D which is bizzarely fixed by ctrl alt del out and in again and the texture glitches here and there AAAAAAANNNNDDDD the fact that the interface is fiddly at best. Yes despite all that buried away underneath is a damn good building game!If you are after Minecraft with better graphics forget it. That depth of gameplay simply isn't there. However if like me you just like building stuff then stick with it as once you get to grips with it's arkwardness, it is very flexible with what you can do thanks to being able to adjust the size of the blocks you can place.The landscapes are endless and look surprisingly good. I have heard that should this game be developed further it will become more blocky like minecraft which would be a real shame. However I have also read that the current asthetic will be retained only not developed further if that makes sense!So in short:-Like just building = worth a punt.Like building / survival = not worth your time at present."

The procedural generation created an absolutely beautiful landscape.  The creation is much more detailed then what you get in Mincecraft.  I can not wait for two things.

I've had a few crashes with exploring caves and overhangs or when breaking down trees but I understand this is an early acess game and going to have bugs but sure seems hell lot less bugy environment wise than starforge.When die I noticed there is no way to close the game or restart while in full screen mode.

The screenshots must have recently been updated because they do represent the game you get. Many of the negative comments appear to be from people who bought the game previously when it had a different look to it. Unfortunately, being Early Access, this is liable to change and some people aren't so happy with that.The game isn't without its flaws and bugs but it's playable and its fun. Be warned, though - there isn't much in the way of tutorials and you'll need to work out some bits for yourself (such as equipping your first tool and learning how to make different shaped blocks).

It still is a laggy mess of a game and nothing like he promised long time ago.And response to his comments is this. No one in their rite mind will eat poop a 2nd time even if the pooper claims its minty now because poop is still poop. He ran the game into the ground and is probly broke so now he trying the same old stunt that we seen again before.As it stands this is still a tec demo that is full of bugs and the dev just whines at people when called on it so go look at creataverse or junk jack or literaly any of the 40 games fully released since this mess was pooped that are sandbox games. Even Trove is better with the cash shop and satin running it. So best to save money for anything else and drop this turd.

,Not Recommended,223490,13223437,"Posted: 4 December, 2014",all,Firedingo,"4/12/14 - The game looks good and has great potential but currently seems a little buggy. Despite my computer being only 4 years old and running an nvidia geforce 555m graphics card, i7-263QM quad core cpu and 8gb of DDR3 RAM I still found I struggled to get decent frames. I got quite a bit of fps lag and even toggling vsync and low settings didn't help. Game could use some optimising. Hope to see this game turn into something great.26/2/16 - EDIT: Tried this game again with a computer brand new. Running Quad core i7-4720HQ @ 2.6 to 3.6 GHZ, Nvidia GTX 960m, 16 gb of Ram. Even with the changes in hardware the game chugged for me. Graphics was stuttery although seemed to run about 15fps I couldn't see exactly. This was in a realistic world on high settings. While it may be advantageous to turn the settings down, the game clearly did not and still does not run well for me and so I'm NOT recommending this game anymore. For others it may play well but I had a terrible experience with this game on more than one try. If you are reading this I recommend you proceed with caution if you consider buying this game."

I would like to say, thats not true. At least, not now. If you follow the Blockscape website and Facebook page, you will get updates every so often of what Jens is working on. Now, as far as the game goes....Its quite good for the current stage its in. It has some very pretty graphics and has pretty good building mechanics aswell, however, they could still be worked upon. But this game is, at least i think, is worth supporting. I dont regret purchasing it :)EDIT: Again, i have seen even more people say that the dev does not update the community about what he is working on. Although, i can forgive this as it might be hard to find the Devlog for some people.http://www.blockscape.com/v2/devlog/There is the devlog. He is updating quite frequently on what he is trying to acheve and what he has accomplished. The extremely infrequent updates, are making it seem like no progress is being made on the game. However, i believe that the dev is waiting until he has developed enough content, to then release a decent update for the game. As you can see in the devlog, he is most certainly working on things. My view on the game has not changed as of late :). Oh, i should also mention, it is only one man working on the game.2nd EDIT: Well, a year on, and the game has gotten no updates. There has been some post made by the dev on the progress of the game, so he is working on it, and has shown some new screenshots of the game and how it looks now. But as of right now, i would NOT by this game. I think its potential is honestly extremely high still, but the future of the game is pretty uncertain at this point.

For a long time the game was broken and not updated (This is where most of the bad reviews came from).  The developer has since resumed pushing updates and fixed many of the problems with the game.  He still has a long ways to go, but it feels to me like it's viable as a building game now.  If you like building and are a patient person I'd say go ahead and give it a try."

At first I was skeptical because the two previous time I had played it were extremely boring.So, after looking at some recent reviews, I decided to try it out.WOWIt has changed dramatically. It runs smoother, looks better, and most importantly, plays better. It is so much better now. Considerably fewer bugs and glitched, plus a new gameplay style which is actually playable, and even fun compared to the previous times I had tried it. Even so, there are some not so great noticeable things.After playing it for an hour, here are some noticable Pros and Cons versus 1 year ago:Pros:+Smoother+Nicer+Playable+FunCons:-Starts to lag after playing for at least an hour-General bugs and glitches that are expected in an early access game being develpoed by one person-Overpriced(Even though it is playable versus when I bought it, it still lacks content for being $20)Overall, I can finally say that I do actually recommend this game."

I just happened to be gonig through my games when I ran across it and saw that it was recently updated. ""Hmm, what's the harm in trying again?"" I thought. I opened up the game and was absolutely amazed. The game has come so far. Hugely better graphics, no crashes and much more stability, an actual tutorial, mobs, structures, and so much more. The developer really worked hard on it, because it is a completely different game from when I last played it from over  a year ago. Just as predicted in my previous review, the game has a lot of potential, and it has surely pulled it off. Is it a complete game? No, and far from it. It needs work, but holy crap, the developer has kicked butt on this game. Even though this game doesn't have a ton of content now, I am still seeing great things with it. If you don't get it now, consider it in the future, because the developer is super passionate about the game. The game has a lot of potential, and it will be really good. It is good enough to change my review and opinion of the game, and it is only getting better. Keep up the good work, dev.---11/22/2015---The game crashes a lot. This is indeed a fact. I know that the dev is working hard on it, and there is only one dev. But come on man, there is so much to do, why can't you look for some help? There are already so many negative reviews coming because of the lack of updates. I think that if the dev got some people to work with him, he could push out updates faster and make the game better, because let's face it: the game has potential. A lot of potential. But the dev is only shooting himself in the foot by being the only one working on it. Hell, by the time he is done with it, he will have a 10% or less recommended rate, and who would want to buy the game then? Until he either 1) is able to make more updates (somehow) by himself, or gets help to make the game and update more, then I am going to have to say Not recommended."
