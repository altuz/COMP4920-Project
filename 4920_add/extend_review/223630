If the community is active at the time of purchase you will enjoy this game."
,Recommended,223630,14941185,"Posted: 17 March, 2015",all,Kerma,"It's hard to give airbuccaneers a fair review. It really is. Why? Because as of writing, both servers up right now have 0/32 players.I really doubt anyone will even read this review, only because this is a game time forgot. I bought it when it first came out on steam, and since nothing has changed since other than going free to play (with no bonus for people who previously bought, something that would anger most people but I had my fun with it so I feel it's only fair) all I can do is reminisce on previous times I've played this game in 2013 when it wasn't horribly dead.I feel like AirBuccaneers is a game that if it had a thriving playerbase it wouldn't be at ""mixed"" of 60% positive ratings. It's rough around the edges- but not in a way that negatively impacts the game. The game works like most air combat simulators, you fly around in airships and shoot different types of weapons at the enemy while the pilot tries to steer you out of the way of projectiles incoming so you don't horribly crash and burn to your pitiful death. What makes AirBuccaneers different than guns of icarus? Ground combat. It's a lie to say you can walk to your enemies base and kill them via one on one fistfights as the ground is covered in poisonous mushrooms, but in AirBuccaneers you spawn in your home base and can choose what ship to board either by walking onto a docked one or using an hangglider to get to one in the air. But how does this equate into ground combat? You have free movement and aren't locked onto your ship, meaning it's a legitimate strategy to either dismount your hangglider in mid air and jump onto the enemy's ship or to jump from your own and engage in proper swashbuckling- or just take their helm and drive their ship into a cliff. You can also use one of the diverse ship types like the Kamikaze ship that instantly destroys anything when touched (but it horrendously underarmoured) or the massive, immobile fort that has a huge cannon on it but can only move via air maneuver which takes a long time to recharge.Another great thing about airbuccaneers is the perks and flaws system. I found this very unique at the time, and it still sticks out to me as one of the only multiplayer games that has something like this. There are very overpowered perks in each level progression tree that you can pick to make yourself better suited to one role, but there are negatives in that tree (or other trees) you must choose from as well. This would be just OK if the perks were something generic like ""move 10% faster"" or ""repair 20% slower"", but they're all mostly fun stuff like ""you're drunk and your screen is tilting"", ""you don't take fall damage"", ""you have an eyepatch over half of your screen"", and ""your gun works like russian roulette and has a random chance of killing you"". I didn't get that far in the perk tree as this game died pretty quickly, but it was the main thing that kept me playing and I really wish another multiplayer game would pick up something similar.So all that positive said, do I recommend AirBuccaneers? Hell yes, if you can find players. It's free to play now, and is a great arcadey game with an interesting character creation system. I just really wish it wasn't dead."

At the start when it was cheep there was alot of people but now there is none i only hope more people will eventually get this game.problem 2. sence there is near to none servers. the NA servers have the more people but you suffer the lag.problem 3 the price $15 for a game thats been out for over a year this is not good.but there is good this game is 10/10 concepts with 10/10 ships and fights i felt as if i was captian killing people as a viking sailing the high winds (or sea's) this game if only it had more people playing it would be better i think the dev's should look at problems and fix them as this is a good gmae just needs more love

And I've got to say, I think it's a complete shame, really and truly. It is an innovative and exciting premise a breath of fresh air from the litany of Terraria clones, army FPS's & FTPMMORPPGS♥♥♥♥THATSHIT.The problem seems to be that the dev's seem to no longer support it, as it's had no updates in a long while.To make thinks worse the game still retains a fairly hefty price tag of €13.99 - which I think is idiotic.What the devsshouldbe doing (if they have no intention of supporting it properly) is to be flogging it off cheaply in steam sales on a regular basis to increase the player base and breath some life into the game.Currently as is, with so few people, I can't say that I'd recommend it for the price - however the game itself is brilliant fun and the level of co-operation I came across with strangers was amazing.So in short, I am going to recommend this game on the games merits, but would either wait for it to go on sale or for the price to drop."

Day one was great, with updates strolling out and plenty of people playing to fill up multiple servers. Pretty much immediately after the game was 'done' and this went into development limbo the playerbase dropped off the map as well, leaving me with a useless game with (every time I came back to it and checked around) 3-5 players online, if any at all.For me, going f2p and offering not a dime to those who had faith at the start is an insult, and their damage control in a vain attempt at reviving a long lost relic is too little too late considering there are other, more interesting (Blackwake) or much more complete (Guns of Icarus) team-based vehicle PvP games."

76561198004753443,Recommended,223630,8532649,"Posted: 3 January, 2014",all,Kerillian,"Air Buccaneers is a game in which you and your team of vikings -or buccaneers- take to the skys aboard rickety looking airships to blow each other to bits. Well, it could be that game. Unfortunately, nobody plays it.I've been [trying] to play it for the past couple of days and have had a grand total of 2 populated sessions. With a few exceptions, it was the same group of players each time. I'm not really surprised that this is the case, have you heard about Air Buccaneers? It was featured on Steam when it released, but then it just sort of vanished.The developers seem to be neglecting it too – when I first played it near release among my first thoughts were “wow, this will be great with a bit of polish and some content updates.” I don't think either have happened. A quick visit to the Steam community forums would show you that the small player base echoes this opinion.It's a crying shame, really. Air Buccaneers could be a really fun game. During my time playing I met a player called Keel and truly were we the gods of the wind! Single handedly we held off barrages from. . . AI controlled airships because only one other person was in the game. While I'm glad that bots take over when there aren't enough players, it's just not as satisfying. Especially since AI ships can't be boarded and captured – which is one of my favourite aspects of Air Buccaneers.Seldom did me and Keel get a chance to clumsily weave through a barrage of cannon fire, pull up to the enemy and leap through the skies – swords in hand – to claim an enemy ship for our own. But when it happened, it was glorious.Air Buccaneers has 3 game modes: Deathmatch, Domination and Protect The Golden Ship.In Deathmatch you blow up enemy ships to score points, in domination you blow up enemy ships to score points and in Protect The Golden Ship you blow up enemy ships to score points but also have to blow up the golden ship – One team defends and the other attacks. So there isn't much variance there.There are 3 roles in Air Buccaneers. Captain, shooter and Everything Else Guy.The captain pilots the ship, shouting out orders to the crew and calling out the locations of enemy ships. The shooters man the cannons, manually aiming the cannon and trying to predict the ball's trajectory [there is no aiming reticle]. The Everything Else Guy does everything else, if you aren't behind the wheel or behind the cannon then you're fixing the ship, spotting enemy ships, firing off air-mines or supporting the cannons by reducing the cooldown time on their shots.The roles are flexible, at any time the captain can ditch the wheel and hop on the cannons or the shooter can decide he's had enough of missing shots and instead just leap onto the enemy ship to engage in an exciting battle of who can click their sword the fastest. Melee combat leaves much to be desired, which makes boarding less exciting than it could be. But is melee combat really important in a game about piloting an airship to shoot other airships?There are 4 types of ships in Air Buccaneers. As before I'm going to make up their names because I don't think the names of anything are mentioned anywhere in game.First up you have what I call the Classic. Not particularly fast, four cannons and hardy enough to soak up a few cannons before dropping out of the sky. Then you have the Speedy McGoFast; only one cannon, fairly small and weak, fast enough to get close enough to an enemy ship to initiate a surprise boarding party.There is also the Flying Fortress. Very slow, very big, I think it has a strong defence? I've never actually seen a cannon hit it. It's an incredibly long ranged cannon platform that nobody really uses. And finally you have the OH COME ON. A speedy little kamikaze ship fit for one person. No cannons because you are the cannon. Pick a target and smash right into them, sacrificing yourself for the good of the team [only to respawn a second later to do it again].I took a break from writing this to see if I could play Air Buccaneers. Nobody was online.So, would I recommend Air Buccaneers? Well it depends on how many people are listening to me. A couple of friends? Probably not. The servers are too empty. But if I had an audience of enough people to populate servers? Heck yeah. It's a fun game that's worth checking out if you have a large enough group of people to actually play."

In addition, the playerbase has dwindled, probably because of the lack of developer interest. This is a multiplayer game and the bots just don't cut it. Finally, it has a very steep learning curve and has no tutorial, this means that, even if you do get a good game going with a few people, newbies tend to be left clueless and not knowing what to do.Overall, I'd say wait for a sale and pick up a copy on the cheap. Anything under €5 is reasonable. If there's a strong game going, join in and try to pick it up. A good AirBuccs match is a week's worth of fun, but be prepared for the possibility that the game will die entirely."

You pick either side and head for the sky with your airship.In the air you'll have to co-operate with your teammates; someone needs to steer the ship and another person fires its cannons. With the small ships it is possible to do both of the tasks on your own; but it's pretty hard.Ofcourse you could also just grab a kamikazi-baloon and steer it into the enemies' airship.The in-game combat system is pretty good. Cannons are slow and hard to aim, but their impact is devastating.It's also possible to board the enemies' ship, but you'll be at such a close range already that either ship will sink in seconds due to mutual cannonfire.If you manage to board the enemies' ship without it getting sunk, prepare for a chase and catch game.For a game released in december 2012, the details on the characters and ships are horrible. The maps themselves look okay, but are very limited in number.Overall it's a game that has potential, but it's not worth € 14."
