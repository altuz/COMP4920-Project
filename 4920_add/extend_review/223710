76561198004369747,Recommended,223710,29915141,Posted: 13 February,all,Lo Wang,"This is classic survival horror.  Play on easy, unless you are very familiar with the genre, then play on normal or maybe hard.  Think classic Resident Evil/Silent Hill.  You could end up restarting the game, if you perform poorly enough.It boasts a lot of content: the main campaign, about 6-8 hours, although 2.5 hours is achievable.  There's a 'Hunk' campaign, similar to RE2, after the main campaign where you run a gauntlet with no saves or anything.  There are many unlockables, like infinite ammo famas, camera that freezes everything.  There are also fan-made custom campaigns which can be played in any order, at any time.  Finally, there is a coop campaign.There are 5 different endings you can get, depending on the choices you make."

,Recommended,223710,29970642,Posted: 16 February,all,Kæiser pöcketcommie☭,"In theme this is a great game and is able to give off a great atmosphere. Clearly inspred from silent hill, which is always good, in fact going deeper into it It, it gets better, but the start of the game isn't great, the sp00ky jumpscare at the start can give a bad impression. The combat? Its really not that good either, its melee combat is preety terrible and its placement of enemies really makes it look confused, it wanting to be a SH esc game, or a dead space game, though for the atmosphere its amazing and I'd suggest trying it out for that."
,Recommended,223710,30111743,Posted: 22 February,all,⛧ Morizu ⛧,"I think I would play this one again for sure. It's a creepy free Horror Game. But be careful if you are weak against horror. I have to say, it's an awesome Game and it's for free. So I can't make bad Review to that. It's not brilliant, but it's good against other free horror Games on Steam.Awesome job.Can't wait to wet my trousers very soon. XD"
76561198196749099,Recommended,223710,29936311,Posted: 14 February,all,Stream,"This game should be a series. It has the potential of being a ""Triple A"" title. Heart pounding gameplay, Scary monsters at every turn and most of all it seriously messes with your head. This is Silent Hill's indie brother in-law."
,Recommended,223710,8948400,"Posted: 2 February, 2014",all,binarydood,"One of the best survival horrors out there. The influence of Silent Hill (especially 2) is clearly visible on both gameplay and theme, but capturing that kind of atmosphere and mood can only be a compliment, A huge one. And worry not because Cry of Fear does have a really strong identity of it's own.The limitations of the Gold Source engine are barely noticeble due to just how much the original game was modifyed, however, like Half Life, Cry of Fear also changes gameplay mechanics from times to times, depending on the scenario you're in. For a horror game, Cry of Fear does this tremendously well, and except for a few moments of the game (like the falling train sequence) the game manages to use the change of it way of playing as a way of provoking fear into the player rather than frustration, since from a moment to another you will be forced to think in a different way if you want to progress.The story like I said earlier, is incredibly influenced by Silent Hill, however, it is obvious that alot of it came from the creator's life experiences. One thing I must criticize is that not all monsters seem to represent imidiatly Simons guilt and fears, some of them are just twisted and disturbing for the sake of being twisted and disturbing, but, while they dont offer much in terms of the main characters' psyche, they do offer more variety of gameplay, since Cry of Fear does have many diferent types of enemies. All I can say plot-wise is that it takes it's time to reveal what's actually going on, and the closer you get to the truth, the more twisted and nightmaqrish the visuals of the game will become, to express the depression and suicidal tendencies of the protagonist.The gameplay is filled with subtle details that are mostly overlooked even by the greatest of the surival horror genre, wether old or new. The presence of those elements only make this game grimmer and genuinly terrifying, since they add depth to the game, and you will have to consider their use if you want to survive due to the scarce resources.I was also incredibly impressed due to the quantity of bonus material. You get a bunch of new game modes, extra weapons, developer commentary, diferent outfits, trophys, pages of Simon's book, and also, parts of the game switch simply by starting new playtroughts. For example, codes for specific doors change so you cant simply resort to online help to solve a puzzle. There are also TONS of easter eggs in the game, 4 diferent endings on the main singleplayer, theres multiplayer and 4 different difficulty settings. Also, props to the sound design and music, it's also great.For a free game this is absolutly amazing, and for such a small team of developers... Then my god you guys have created a masterpiece. It is one of the scariest games I've ever played, dont let the terrible jumpscare screamer at the beginning reflect how the rest of the game is gonna be. And if you like Cry of Fear, then I highly recoment Afraid of Monsters as well, but that one you will have to install like a regular Half Life mod. This game, at least for me, proved that both game with combat or without combat can be just as scary as one another, taking diferent routes for their game design.So, if you are a horror fan, why arent you playing Cry of Fear yet?"

The only thing that I dislike is that the campaign in co op is short and once you did it there is not much else to do. Though there are more singleplayer maps avalible to play with, but most of them are unfortunately not co op.Overall: Great game and very fun to play co-op 8/10"

,Recommended,223710,29450552,Posted: 23 January,all,mathias_freire,"It was a very unique FPS game I've ever played. Because;- It doesn't let you carry things more than six or three- There are no cheats- It gives 5 save slots- There is no auto respawning. If you die, game ends. And you may load any saved games manually then- Terrifying atmosphere, very creative monsters, limited resources. Horror part comes from jumpscares. But besides that, the environment doesn't make you feel good, maybe the last part. Sunshines, bird singings etc. Worths to give a shot, actually for a free game, it is better than most of the paid games."

,Not Recommended,223710,29631246,Posted: 1 February,all,Im a Poop SEM :(,"(THIS IS THE REVIEW FOR THE CO-OP EXPERIENCE)Frustrating. Absolute frustrating after the first chapter. But the small download size compensates for its poor level design according to today's standards. The AI is clumsy, getting stuck in the walls, closed doors to name a few. But the one thing which I liked is the randomality of enemy spawns. I mean if you go through a level and just died a few inches away from the door(which leads to the next level), and are forced to spawn back from the beginning, the enemies are not there where you last saw them and expect to encounter because of the random spawns. Another down fact is that the weapons. Very rare and inconvinient spawns which make the first hour extremely frustrating. I know for this genre there needs to be a scarcity of ammo, but scarcity to this degree was ridiculous where you are offered with a 6 shot single magazine and the enemies require more than 3 shots to be killed, even though you headshot them, the gun offered at the beginning does not carry out its job of headshotting properly."

The graphics are based on Half Life engine so its not the best. i havent played all of it but i like it. Multiplayer doesnt seem to work without Hamachi or smth
