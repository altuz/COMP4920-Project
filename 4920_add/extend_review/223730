But be WARNED this game is very challenging and difficult as you progress further through it. I got about Quarter way through and had to give up, just got to difficult for me. But if you do like a challenging beautiful and cute platformer game, then i do recommend picking up this game, even though it was difficult for me, i have absolutely no regrets having it in my library.Believe me it's a very cute and colourful game, besides being difficult of course. And at 75% of it's a very good deal. :D"

You won't find many cartoonish platformers prettier than this one. The graphics, gameplay and mechanics all were smooth and gorgeous. I thoroughly enjoyed the 8 hours of this campaign. Although the final boss was a bit drawn-out and tedious. This game was one of the first to come out of Greenlight. I can see why Steam showcased it."
,Recommended,223730,11812048,"Posted: 21 August, 2014",all,viad,"Fly'n is a puzzle platformer that delivers a delightful amount of platform and puzzle gameplay, on top of a richly designed world.In Fly'n, players control small, cute looking creatures called Buds. There are four different kinds, which all have the same ability to double jump, glide, and switch states of the level. Each Bud has a unique ability that is used to solve certain puzzles in the game. The levels range from run and jump platforming to solving puzzles using a certain character. While things may seem easy at first, the levels get harder to be actually quite challenging. The puzzles grow to involve using more characters together in one level and more challenging level layouts. The normal levels have no timer, except for certain levels that are more linear in nature and involve outrunning a rising sea of junk. These speedrun kind of levels are the harder levels in the game, due to the strict time limits and higher bar for platforming skill. A boss battle occurs at the end of each world, complete with more puzzle platforming to navigate through and win. The levels are all fun to play through and try to solve, with levels tending to take around 5-10 minutes or maybe more depending on the pace of play.Controling the characters feels natural and responsive at times. Sometimes, moving the Buds around feels not as refined as they might sometimes move too fast when not needed to be or don't jump as high enough. Still, the controls are solid and work well with only a few quirks that may pop up when playing the game.The art style of Fly'n is very, very well drawn. The characters have a simplistic design with solid colors and simple shapes. On the other hand, the worlds are highly detailed with lots of color and intricate designs on the surfaces of each level. The world styles range from natural inspired designs with foilage, to more abstract designs and mechanical parts. Changing the state of the level turns the world to silhouettes or a more tinted color. The animation is also really well done both ingame and in the cutscenes. The characters themselves are simple in design, but are animated so smoothly that it feels natural. The cutscenes are also of high visual quality, owing in part that both the ingame and cutscene character data are both from the same source material. With high details with great animation and drawing style, the art style is very pleasing to look at and play with.The music in Fly'n adds a nice backdrop to the graphical design. The songs tend to be relaxed in nature or more frantic depending on what level is going on. There is a fair variety of tracks present in the game, ranging from light, instrumental pieces to faster paced rock or electronic styles. The music does its job in adding to the style of the game, and they do sound great to listen to as well.Fly'n does have a story, albiet a weird one. Basically, a hair dryer collects garbage and dumps them everywhere. The hair dryer dumps it on the worlds where the Buds are. It's up to the Buds to stop the hair dryer from dumping more garbage on their worlds. Anyway, the cutscenes themselves tend to be silly in nature and a little bit weird in terms of storytelling. The story isn't amazing, but tends to silly and help drive the game.Fly'n gives a full 10 hour game with fun and challenging puzzle platforming, set in a world that looks and feels great with the art and animation quality. This game is definitely a joy to play and does provide some great puzzles, all wrapped up in very well done style for the game's setting."

No matter how you look at the game and even if you don't like platformers you have to admit that the complete game is looking fantastic.The story is told fast: A hairdryer called Dyer is attacking the world trees in order to rob their energy the ""Helys"". To prevent this, the world trees have created the buds to stop Dyer  polluting the trees even more.Fly'nis a platformer. You are trying to reach the top of the different trees and fight the specific world boss there. Every world consist of 7 levels plus one boss level and three bonus level (exception is the last world with only one bonus level) so there is a lot to do and the game is gradually getting harder. You have four different buds and every bud has its own special ability. Fly'n can sing and activate the Helys and revive the inhibitants of Helica, Lyft can stick to any (unpolluted) surface and crawl on them, Ywok can transform to a ball and bounce around and Nyls can propel himself (up to three times). And all Buds can jump, double-jump and glide. You can not change the buds freely everywhere, only in the specific checkpoints which is a good thing because you don't have to think too much with whom you have to solve a specific part of the level. Additional to all the abilites the buds can also change between two visions which may make different parts of the level solid and/or accessible.As for the difficulty: If you only try to reach the exit it should only need patience since you may die as often as you ""wish"" and you will restart from the last checkpoint. But you should notice that the game has been tagged as ""hard"" so keep that in mind. It may look cute but you need to know what you are doing. For those looking for a higher challenge there are different options: You may try to ""complete"" the levels which means you explore more and collect all the Helys and pollen which are hidden. If you are still not satisfied you can try to play the levels without dying. And for the motivated there are the Leaderboards where you can compare your points to the rest of the playership.All in all I think I can't recommand this game enough. I bought the game on release day and never regretted it. I put more than 100 hours into this game which says a lot. The buds are lovable and each world has a different beautiful design. If you like platformers you have little to no reason to not buy and playFly'n. All this is rounded up with a beautiful soundtrack which you can and should buy aswell."

You can get further abilities the more you progress in the game, which varies your gameplay experience, while you can also revisit older levels for 100% completion. The music enhances the relaxed atmosphere of the game and its art style should be envied by accomplished titles.The reason I do not recommend it for the average player is that I have found the difficulty level growing significantly, relatively early in the game, with no option whatsoever to adjust it for a smoother experience. This is a great shame for not so skilled players, who can miss the majority of the beautiful worlds portrayed in Flyn, and turn their experience frustrating instead of relaxing. Would definitely recommend it though, if your platforming skills are above average, or you like a hard challenge. Take my review as a warning, with a grain of salt."

I can't stop thinking about it. I've played it twice through and feel like I could play it many, many more times and not get tired of it. I don't know what it is about this game. The fantastic art, the great music, the stellar level design and creativity, the superb gameplay mechanics.... just everything about this game comes together into a nearly perfect package. There is one bad level in the game, out of 40, and it's not *terrible* either. There's one other relatively mean move, but it's an optional thing that you could easily ignore.

76561198084544660,Recommended,223730,12293008,"Posted: 29 September, 2014",all,andrewb,"This is one of the most enjoyable platformers I have ever played.It takes place in a beautiful, surreal-looking world that is being corrupted by red trash which is being deployed by a weird metal creature with haird-dryer for a head (um...yea).You take a role of one of 4 Buds, creatures native to the afforementioned world, all with a unique ability. All of them can double jump and glide, but the blue one can sing, green one can turn to a lettuce that sticks to any surface so he can climb walls and stuff, the black one can turn into a bouncy ball and the red one can dash multiple times being able to cross large distances even vertically.The goal is to reach the end of the level while collecting as many floating seeds that simply give you score and weird glowing balls that you use to solve certain puzzles. There is also a timer and leaderboards so if you like going OCD over collecting everything and getting the best time and score possible, this game's got you covered.There are 2 kinds of levels. In most of them, you have infinite time to finish and collect everything but once in a while the game throws the other kind at you, where you must rush upwards as fast as possible because there is red garbage rising from below that kills you if you touch it. So the pace of the game kinda alternates between slow (not if you are speedrunning, but you CAN go slow), methodical gameplay and frantic mandatory speedrunning which is something I liked, it kept me engaged.There is also a bonus available when you don't die on those speedy levels which I found absolutely rage-inducing because some of the later ones are VERY difficult, but it does give you a reason to try and master the game so I still consider it a good thing.Overall, I find this game great. Great visuals, interesting gameplay mechanics and  the price is almost suspiciously low. I certainly recommend it."

Just when you think you've overcome the most difficult part of the game, you're right at the next one.  It's quite unforgiving at times, where you miss something by just one pixel (exaggerating), may even make you want to ragequit.  At those times, take a little break, do something else and come back later.Recommended, I would say you don't need to wait for a sale to collect this one.  Definitely watch some gameplay videos to get an idea of what this is like.I should mention - in full screen I couldn't get past 42fps, it just seems to be stuck.  I had to go into windowed mode to get 60fps.  The game is 4-5 years old now so I don't think the developers will be fixing this now.Works well with a Steam controller."

A seamless, challenging, atmospheric platformer with an unusual method of control and gameplay; both in a good way mind you.

The asethetic, the gameplay, the levels (though, some of the rising levels are admittedly questionable), the music, and of course, the price! Its insane for Ankama to be asking a mere $10 for this.

A lot of the moves required very precise motions of the analog stick and very precise timing on multiple buttons, often at the same time. I am not as young as I once was, and I am afraid that my reflexes are no longer fast enough for a game like this. For the parts that I was able to complete (the first half of the game) it was a lot of fun. The art is great, the sounds are cool, and your character is very cute. The game is fast paced and fun for the most part, my thumbs were sore after playing for a while on my controller.

,Recommended,223730,20898314,"Posted: 1 February, 2016",all,Lighterthanair,"Fly'N is a gorgeous 2D platformer with puzzle elements and fast paced gameplay. Fly'N progresses through 5 worlds, each with a different and gorgeous art theme.As you play FLy'N you will acquire additional playable characters (for a total of 4), each of which has its own unique skills. The skills include singing, wall-climbing, bouncing, and darting through the air rapidly. These skills are necessary for navigating levels, opening new pathways, and avoiding damage. Each character can also double jump or glide. In my experience playing the game, I felt that character controls were responsive and smooth and I did not experience any bugs.The aspect that really drew me into the Fly'N was the art style. Fly'N art themes range from a botanical/floral theme to a mechanical/industrial theme. Each world has a unique look and every world is very colorful. The characters themselves are also very unique, colorful, and well animated. I also felt the sound design and music are well above average in quality.Fly'N also stands out in level design. While the levels can be very challenging, they never seemed frustrating. Out of my (many) deaths, I never felt I had anyone to blame but myself. The levels typically involve using your different skills to get past obstacles, avoid touching deadly surfaces, navigate moving platforms, and outrunning a rising layer of gears, bolts, and screws which kill you if you touch them. For lack of a better description, I will refer to this as the ""ocean of doom"" from here on. In addition, there are three types of levels throughout the game. The first, which makes up most of the levels, involves navigating obstacles and finding the way to the end of the level. The second, more challenging level type is similar to the first but adds the additional challenge of the ""ocean of doom"" gradually rises through the map, forcing you to move quickly. The last level type is the two-stage boss battles where you must first fight a mechanical boss which usually involves avoiding projectiles and a significant amount of platforming. The second-stage of the boss battles involves you traveling inside the boss to dismantle it by collecting glowing orbs and using them to break down the machinery.If you are interested in a story, Fly'N has one but don't expect much. It is very minimal and its not why I would choose to play the game. The story is very basic and is essentially just there to provide a context to play. There is a bad guy, he is messing up your world, and you are trying to stop him and repair the damage he does. However, I don't consider the minimal story a drawback because that really is all this game needs to make it fun.I have seen some reviews critique the difficulty of Fly'N . However, though Fly'N was challenging, I was able to complete the game without too much trouble and I would not say that my skills are above average when it comes to platformers. Fly'N also gives you the option of decreasing the difficulty of the ""ocean of doom"" levels if you die too many times by stopping the ""ocean of doom"" from rising. On the other hand, if you are a completionist, the ""ocean of doom"" levels have optional bonus objectives that require you to complete levels quickly and without dying. The game also offers many collectables and secrets to discover. I was content with just completing the levels and finishing the game. In my opinion, trying to collect all items, find all secrets, and getting through the levels without dying would take a great deal of skill and dedication.As you can see from my recorded hours in game, I was able to complete the game in just over 7 hours. I imagine that this would be in the ballpark of how long it would take the average gamer. If your platforming skills are better than mine you could probably shave that time down by a pretty good margin as I died pretty frequently. If, on the other hand, you are a completionist....expect much longer since I imagine you will be replaying and restarting levels a ton. I would also say that Fly'N has a pretty decent margin of replayability. Overall, I felt that the game was definitely worth the price tag.TL;DR: Fly'N is a great little platformer with excellent art and sound design, exceptional level design, and provides a good challenge that any fan of platformers can enjoy. I highly recommend this game and I also tip my hat to the developers who clearly put in a lot of effort to make a high quality and very fun game."

The difficulty becomes fantastically challenging to the point that I was breaking a sweat on many occasions. It's tough, but you get infinite lives and feel like a complete boss when you execute it perfectly. I'd definitely recommend a controller for this one, as the keyboard might be a bit awkward at timesThe only thing where this game really fails... the ending. It grudgingly just felt very rushed. Maybe I've played too much Sonic and want to enjoy utterly wrecking a big, evil machine in the final level - but it weirdly switched from the fun boss fights it had throughout to basically dying repeatedly whilst you learn the sequence to basically avoid dying. After the anti-climatic level; the end doesn't seem to conclude much too. Without spoiling it, you kinda get a ""yay! It's all sorted""... without anything really being sorted. There's still 4 tree worlds completely wrecked with garbage. It just really sucked considering how well the game had been executed up to that pointIn the grand scheme of things - it's a small gripe, as I got 10+ fantastic and gripping hours out of this game (just the basic game too...

The rising lava stages are the worst of the bunch in this regard and are bound to test the patience of even the most composed of gamers.It's a real shame because the art, music, sound design... it's all really good, but ultimately wasted on a game severely lacking polish in its most crucial department."

The story is something you've see before. But is well done displayed... But for a game where the controls / gameplay is described so poorly the looks don't matter. Controls (and from time to time gameplay) come before the looks of a game.It's the reason why I asked a refund for this. Furthermore: there is no Tutorial !"

I can remember that I wrote in my review for Giana Sisters that I hated every minute of playing it (I gave that game a positive review, too) ... I can safely say for this game that I hated every single second of it.I initially bought it because it was on sale, things look so easy in videos and I found the visuals rather cute. I could not have been more mistaken. I played it with a controller and my thumbs are still hurting. The controller's life was only spared from being thrown against the wall because it is relatively new.Since the game is really well made I can recommend it: If you are a platformer completionist and are up for a challenge, look no further. If you find failing in these games infuriating and struggle with precision jumps and creative level design, stay away from this one."

The emphasis of this game is on the platforming but the levels are laid out in a way that makes it more puzzley, having to backtrack and figure out where you are headed.The game starts out simple enough, and seems very casual friendly, but as you unlock more characters, the levels get harder and the difficulty becomes very steep towards the end of the game.I love the visuals in this game. It has a cute art style that is completely unique. You begin to appreciate the world you're involved in.The gameplay itself revolves around trying get through basic levels, but between all the collectables, and the different characters you use, it doesn't feel very linear. This can be frustrating or enjoyable, depending on the level and depending on the type of player you are. The mechanics are very solid, the game controls well and the mechanics that each creature has lends itself to creative play. The Black creature, which uses a bouncing mechanic was difficult for me to get the hang of, but once you understand it, it can become quite fun to play around with.The game took me about 6 hours to completion, without collecting much and without doing the bonus levels. I was very satisifed and felt very challenged towards the end. This game might become too challenging for a more casual audience, as I'm use to playing more hardcore platformers.The boss fights were also interesting as they were focused on the platforming itself, which I feel is the right call instead of a typical ""jump on the bad guy"" playstyle you might see in platformersThe story is hit or miss, I wasn't 100% sure what was going on but the cutscenes were still enjoyable to watch.Pros-Great length for the price, good value-Solid and Unique Mechanics-Lot of extras in levels and beyond-Interesting Boss Fights-Awesome Art Style-Challenging, bit steep on difficulty curveCons-Saw Minor Frame Rate Drops at some portions-Might be too challenging for casual play-Nonlinear level layout may confuse players-Some players might feel overburdened by the large amount of mechanicsI really enjoyed Fly'N and I highly recommend it. Even a casual player will enjoy the early portions of the game. This is another must have platformer on steam if you love this genre.

The difficulty is spot on: never too easy or too hard, unless you are trying to get 100% completion. The way collectibles work is also similar to Rayman Origins, but the gameplay similarities stop there. The pace in Fly'n is slower and there is an emphasis in using the abilities of each of the 4 characters to overcome obstacles and transverse the levels, which are not simple left to right affairs: they are big and sprawling and you move both horizontally and vertically, free to go back and forth. Although the game is 2D, the level design reminds me of the levels in the 3D platformers of the N64 era. Buy this game, it's totally worth it even for full price."

Responsive, intuitive controls and exciting gameplay make this game one of the best platformers I've played to date. I'd gladly recommend this game to even the most skilled gamer, as some challenges within the game require extreme puzzle-solving and button-pressing skills alike. Getting past certain levels without dying unlocks even more difficult challenges than the level you unlocked it with, and the bonus puzzles do not skimp on their difficulty. Mazes made entirely of the collectable plant-things, following trails, puzzle-solving, all present within and throughout the game and bonus levels.9/10 - My only two issues is the lack of options and the lack of explanation. You can change monitor resolution, sound and music volumes, controls, and one or two other, simple details, but other than that, that's it. Also, important places like the cocoon aren't properly explained, but the lack of explanation allows for a little exploration and discovery that isn't entirely unwelcomed."

If you're a fan of 2D platformers like me, and you don't mind using different abilities to traverse levels, then this is the game for you.  This game is a lot of fun, but it's also quite punishing when you die.  There's a lot of replay value...you can replay levels to get a better score and save more creatures.  Creative use of each character's abilities is present in this game.It can definitely get difficult at some points.  I'm on world 4 right now and it's defintely a lot harder than the previous worlds.  There are essentially 3 types of levels: casual levels (where you can take your time and collect all the little dittys), rush/timed levels (these levels are intense...an unstoppable rising pool of lava is out to destroy you), and boss levels.Boss levels are well designed.  Each of them is a mechanical machine that you need to traverse using the abilities that you are given.  Then once you beat the boss, you make your way inside the machine and disable it from the inside.The rush/timed levels are the only gripe I have about this game.  I think there are too many of them.  If you die, you don't save the creature at the top.  If you die too many times, the game pretty much tells you ""You suck"" and a dialog appears that gives you the option of turning off the rising pool of lava.  These levels are designed to be hardcore, and it's pretty much impossible to NOT die your first time through.All in all I would definitely recommend this game.  If your feverishly addicted to platformers like I am, this is not one to miss.  I rate this game an 8/10 with a BADASS seal of approval.  I love the art style and the music is amazing.

It's beautifully painted, with vibrant colours and both ""versions"" of the world just as pretty as each other, and it makes for a really immersive experience.

However, it's surprisingly difficult. It'll certainly keep you concentrating, and it's great fun. It's probably enjoyed best with a controller, since using a keyboard makes complex manouvres kind of difficult in places, but I'm getting along just fine on the keyboard so as long as you set the controls to something easy to use (you can change any key) you'll do great.I wholeheartedly recommend this game; it's one of the most entertaining things I've played in quite a while.

The design team must have been putting in a lot of overtime because the visuals are crisp, clean and fluid, and the music sets the scenes very well. The controls are a little different from usual platformer games because of the natures of your protagonists: A and D handle 'left' and 'right' movement, S 'down,' but since W is used for gliding in mid-air, 'up' is relegated to right mouse button. It's a little weird but once you get used to it I find it works just great.The character designs are neat (especially the player-controlled protagonists, of which there are 4 in total, each with a wildly unique ability for navigating through levels). And I've actually come to strongly dislike the antagonist, a sentient hair dryer who would I guess be adorable if he wasn't such a♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥and intent on ruining your world.The main detraction of this game I suppose is that there isn't really much of a story to go on... something more along the lines of early Sonic games, I guess: Evil Bad Guy comes and does Bad Stuff, and it's up to you to stop him."

On the other hand if you're a collect-a-thon type of person it may occasionally be irritable when you have 99/100 collectables on a level and there is no way no know even the general vicinity of the last seed and some of them are hidden perhaps a tad too well - I will admit I resorted to cheating to find those last little seeds.
