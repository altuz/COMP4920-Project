76561198047621393,Recommended,223750,29584806,Posted: 30 January,all,Wolf8312,"To do this game justice I almost bankrupted my family. First there was my Warthog HOTAS, then the track IR, then I realized that I badly needed pedals, and then disaster hit, VR came out!Its an amazing simulation even without VR and after about 200 hours (on this and DCS 2) I still pretty much suck! Its just an amazing experience. Not only are you flying but using modern day computer systems to seek, lock onto, and destroy your enemy fromyway up above. Its terrifying to imagine being up against these beasts! At the moment they knew you were a dead man You wouldnt even know they were there, watching from above, as the missile they had just launched cut through the sky towards you.Dont pay attention to the 'mixed' reviews this game gets trolled alot because its free. This means casual gamers load it up without knowing what it is, and end up getting butt hurt. But you probably already know that! This game may be free but as I already mentioned to really do it justice its probably the most expensive game you will ever buy! You dont have to buy everything I bought for it all at once but to get the most out of it at the very least you need a HOTAS and track IR.Its not a game you could possibly enjoy without actually learning how to fly (take off, and land) and understand the computer systems at your fingertips. With a good HOTAS combined with peddals the feeling of flight is incredible. Add in VR and its a damned near perfect experience!I feel immensely pleased that I decided to to take the plunge and teach myself some of this simulators modules. The one I enjoy the most has to be the black shark helicopter.The reward is that once you have mastered the sim itself you can start enjoying the game, and attempt some of the military missions the 'game' sets for you. In short you can start blowing stuff up!I think almost everyone would love this simulator, but not everybody is willing to sit down and learn. Things are easier these days though and there are loads of videos you can watch on you-tube. When you get into it you will also find, that learning to fly a plane, or helicopter is (of course) alot of fun and the more skilled you become the less like work it will seem.Its not like playing a game its like flying a military helicopter with military modern weapon systems at your fingertips!"

Between the details and the amazing physics of the aircraft and flight. I will say if you want the full experience be sure to spend the money and get the Thrustmaster Warthog and MFG Crosswind pedals. I have paid for almost every aircraft available and I can say I do not regret a single one of them. The developers are always making it better and we will soon have the maps all in one version as well as the F18 and some much looked forward to WW2 aircraft, not that there isnt already enough of these amazing pieces of art but lets be honest there is no such thing as too many. Eagle Dynamics and all the aircraft developer companies have sucked me in and this is one of those games that you just wont regret. Everything was and is done right with this simulator. I keep calling it a game when in all honesty this is a pretty hardcore sim. Dont be scared when you hear hardcore though, you can make it whatever you want from relaxed to full on PVP combat. Many of these aircraft have all working buttons and knobs and require you to learn them inside and out which for many people is what we wanted in a sim this great. I have logged approx 45 hours in the A10C and have learned fully how to start it properly and taxi, how to trouble shoot problems and mitigate them in the air, How to drop bombs and use the weapons systems. Still much much more for me to learn and it will more than likely get hundreds of hours in the coming years alone. As for the mission editing it is fairly simple and with a few hours of learning you can make a very nice mission to your wants and needs. Again this simulator is fantastic and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking to get into a really good combat flight sim. 11/10 stars from me."

I run on max settings and the graphics are amazing, at the minimum you need a joystick to play, i went cheap myself with a logitech 3d pro, but i know alot that have a full setup with seperate pedals/thottle controls which does help but i dont think its absolutely necessary, i dont have my own yet because of the cost but id definitely recommend a trackIR system to use in DCS, because in a dogfight its so easy to lose sight of your target, in my case anyway lol, by trying to look around with the keyboard while possibly evading a missle or trying to follow an evading target that maybe slipping in and out of your radar."

76561198005182275,Recommended,223750,30024167,Posted: 18 February,all,Gage™,"Being a long time flight simmer I'm really happy about how DCS world brings flight and air combat to our PC screens. Great Flight sim with a lot of attention to detail. The world is beautifully rendered with lots of, hills, valleys, towns, cities, rivers and thousands of trees all over the landscape. Aircraft are beatutifully rendered inside and out, they sound thunderous and the flight physics feel pretty accurate to me. Mind you, to my disgust I've never had the chance to fly around like a excited wide eyed lunatic in an F-15 or an A-10 but aircraft feel responsive to a host of factors in the air from cross winds, to the weight of your loadout, temperature, altitude etc. Honestly a lot of the time I have a great time just flying around enjoying the sensation of flight.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1A0Kokkr_sThis sim does have a pretty steep learning curve and will take some time to learn each aircraft and it's systems. Modules can be expensive but its best you chose an aircraft you want to learn and master it as each aircraft functions fundamentaly differnt. I would treat each full price module has it's own simulator. There are cheaper modules available as well that are not as expensive or as detailed that will still give you a pretty awesome flying experience for a fraction of the price.I will definatly say that this is not a casual game. I see lots of reviews from people saying wtf I coudln't even make it off the ground etc etc. Its really recommended you RTFM or seek out some tutorials. I would also recommend some form of HOTAS setup for the best experience.More content is being added frequently, I'm particulary looking forward to DCS 2.0 going live, which includes Las Vegas / Nellis AFB and red flag campaigns, as well as the addition to the release of the F/A-18.Lastly, performance wise DCS is pretty CPU intensive. If you have a decent CPU, you will certainly get better performance. Though some easy ways to boost performance is to decrease water detail and civillion traffic ( streets are populated with scores of moving vehicles and trains) There are also guides out there for other ways to tweak performance."

Recently, I gave it another shot and now regret giving up on it.The aircraft look and feel great. Multiplayer servers are stable and sharp, and a good place to practice your piloting.DCS is continually updated, and a new terrain engine can be expected in version 2.5. A Swedish Viggen will be released soon, and F-14 is expected beyond that.The only drawback to DCS is the absence of many iconic planes. DCS World includes aircraft from several eras of flight, from WWII to the late Cold War. Many planes have a contemporary; A-10 for Su-25, Sabre for MiG-15, et cetera. However, I hope to someday see the inclusion of a flyable Phantom, F-16, Mig-25, MiG-31 and others. DCS also has the potential to be a platform for simulated naval engagements, and the inclusion of more naval aircraft would also be interesting."

,Recommended,223750,29267654,Posted: 15 January,all,Spades Neil,"This game is as good as it has ever been, and more. The mission editor is more powerful than it once was, there's less glaring bugs, and now there's even a much wider variety of aircraft and countries that can be included in missions (not that you can play as literally every plane obviously, but still).The only real bugs I have noticed are asthetic at best, and only noticeable when flying REALLY low altitude. We're talking skimming treetops.The game otherwise handles very smoothly, even with large missions. Maybe that's because of my hardware, but it's never felt this stable with past editions. My only gripes are that there's only one map (currently), and it does not include Crimea, which was featured in the original Lock On game.All in all the game is as ♥♥♥♥ing excellent as it has always been and I strongly advise everyone with a flight stick to get it. It's a must have for flight sim games. The best part is you can get your feet wet for free by downloading the game and flying the Su-25T. The Frogfoot is a bit clunky to fly, but she's enough to give the Warthog a run for its money without all the complexities of the actual A-10C module."

With that being said.NOTE: Steam keys transfer onto the non steam version, but the non steam keys WILL NOT work on your Steam account. The reason is the store version of the game is in Beta 2.0 and the Steam version isn't..moving on.The modules are great and the planes have a feel to them, you can play the game with keyboard and mouse (not recommended as it's a hassle). I would recommend atleast a low level joystick (Logitech Extreme 3D pro is a good choice) to be able to fly, there are planes where you can use keyboard commands to get it up and running to highly detailed very interactive cockpits where it becomes a study SIM. I like the flexibility and the patience that's required. A very good break from the run and gun flight games out there. This is the second game where I've had more fun then when I played IL-2 Sturmovik.I would recommend shifting to the store version. You will keep any keys you bought from Steam if you shift and the store version has some pretty neat planes that are not available on the Steam version...yet. I've switched to the store version after I found out about more content being available there. But, I leave it to you, if you want to get into it slowly or play the game more often and want hands-on the new content on day one/pre-purchase. The store version has sales often with discounts upto 50% at times. There's two now (as on 26-Feb-2017) one for Russian Fatherland day (Russian planes on sale) and another ""weekend bundle"" (17-Feb-2016 to 27-Feb-2016) with map and module bundles.I guess weekends last for ten days, would like to move wherever ""there"" is ;)I'll see you out there :DP.S:https://www.digitalcombatsimulator.com/en/"
