Most games pre-render their cutscenes, as some computers can't handle them. 3DMark renders extremely complex scenes locally on your system. This allows you to measure the power of your setup, and see how it will perform in games. The other advantage is for overclocking. You can get a score before and after the overclock. This will give you a baseline to see how much improvement you've squeezed from a device with your overclocks. Additionally, an overclock isn't always stable once a card reachers higher heat, or you push it to its limits. 3DMark can also be used to test your stability. If you can run it for a few hours without a crash, your overclock is probably stable! On top of that, the scenes are a joy to look at, and really fun for showing off your computer when friends come over! If you are more than a gamer, a computer enthusiast, pick this up! You won't be dissapointed. If you want a free alternative, check out the ""Unigine"" benchmarks. They are fun too, but won't give the indepth details that 3Dmark will.  -PR0XIDIAN"

To have any hope of getting near the top of leaderboards you will have to spend at least 4-5k of your hard earned cash, and, to add to all of this, there is no gameplay to be found, just a series of cutscenes with no relevance to eachother at all.

PC, WinRT, Android and iOS support are all available. 3DMark's version numbers have been ditched from the product name in an attempt to emphasize the new cross-platform nature of the release. This ill-advised gesture is ignored by the faithful and the press alike, including me.Naming gaffes aside, Futuremark has undertaken the long-overdue rework of their flagship product and emerged with a slick package that sheds the weight of past releases and restores the luxurious visuals and sense of style that have been absent from the last few versions.Installation isn't complicated and remains free of add-on traps and other bloatware, although the gigabyte-sized download isn't petite. Make sure you read the latest instructions: In the case of my system test, beta drivers were actually recommended over certified ones. Once installed, it presents you with a window where the three test environments that comprise the suite can be selected for a benchmarking pass. Advanced options let you select custom visual settings, enable demo modes, loop benchmarks for stress testing and view past results.Ice Storm depicts a low-count polygon world suitable for mobile devices and legacy or entry-level PCs. This is the benchmark destined to run on smartphones, tablets, WinRT devices and similar. The level of detail is roughly equivalent to DirectX 9. The demo mode for this world space is particularly well conceived and despite the lower level of detail, may be the most visually dynamic of the three.Cloud Gate is the middle child, designed to test laptops and office PCs. The stately flybys of massive spacecraft and jump gates are a touch hazy here, but impressive nevertheless. This one is for PCs only, which is a shame, since data on high-end tablets would be of interest. The physics test is particularly tough here, producing FPS numbers lower than Fire Strike, which indicates a CPU bias at play.On the high end is Fire Strike, a fantasy-flavored virtual buffet of advanced effects and massive polygon counts that's designed with tomorrow's hardware in mind, although it will run on today's more muscular PCs with reasonable speed. The gaming system used in my labs managed 30-35 FPS with a single top-shelf videocard and mid-range quad core processor. Laptop usage is euphemistic at best, unless you're packing a specialty road-gaming rig. Needless to say, it'll be a long time before anything like a tablet will have electrics dreams like these.Glitches are few and largely attributable to the 1.00 status of the release. Information fields for processors and video cards yielded blank space on some runs and correct data on others. Users reported partially functional SLI and Crossfire support, which is sadly nothing new to PC gaming, benchmark software or otherwise. Also, OpenGL ES 3.0 support would have been nice.Nevertheless, the scope here is greater than previous 3DMark updates, and the overhaul is mostly successful and complete. Longtime 3DMark users will notice that some details available in previous versions are missing from the more streamlined results available here.While this is sure to spark forum wars, the appearance of other long-awaited features such as temperature monitoring seem more relevant to gamers today and a better expenditure of the limited programming resources available to the Futuremark team. Besides, this leaves room for improvement for the next version. Whatever they eventually decide to call it."

I like it that you can compare your system overtime to see where it is lacking or what needs to be improved. This software has helped me to understand my system more each time I use it. This has helped me to understand my RAM frequencies and see that they were not running at the same frequency which helped me save alot of money. I really recommend this software to any PC guru that wants to get the most out of their system.

I'm really jumping through hoops here to get this working and it's not.A search online will tell you how hit or miss 3DMark is on Windows 10. In my opinion it should really come with a warning label because there really is a significant chance this just won't work on Windows 10. There are some users that spend hours upon hours (like myself) trying to fix it and that's just not right. 3DMark developers stop what you are doing, go online, look at all of the problems that have been reported for Windows 10 and FIX THEM!!!

Compared to other benchmarking software (Unigine Heaven, Unigine Valley, Ashes of the Singularity, Prime95, Cinebench), I would not recommend buying it at this price.Charging 30 bucks for something this broken should be a crime.In Detail:- Physics simulations don't use all available cores or all available CPU time. You see it stuttering, however it barely reaches 17% total CPU usage. This leads me to believe that they use a physics engine that does not have parallel computing in it yet - something most major physics engines now have.- DirectX 11 tests are horribly gimped. So badly that your GPU will actually underclock since it has nothing to do.- DirectX 12 test (TimeSpy) uses an Async Compute implementation that is tailored towards Nvidia cards.- All tests look like they were designed to promote the results of a specific brand or vendor in order to get you to buy the product - even if other benchmarks show it as performing worse."

In this day and age, however, most AAA devs shoot for what a PS4 can do while bolting on some features for the PC.It's easier than ever to just get a current high end CPU and then you spring for either a GTX 1070 or a 1080 and enjoy your hardware for a few years. I don't recommend 3D Mark anymore. There is no special insight to be had, and for the purpose of reviewing hardware you're better off benchmarking actual games. The point of doing that is also greatly diminished as picking GPU companies is about like picking Presidents. You have two companies to pick from. During 3D Mark's heyday we had more than two different graphics companies (3dfx, nVidia, ATI, S3-hey now, Savage3D and Savage2k were pretty good, and Matrox). Each company had a different way of engineering things and 3D Mark was great at exposing their driver quality as well as their architectures.

Simply it does what it should do.SurfaceThis tool has a nice and clean surface. It’s easy to understand and you’ll have always the overview. 3DMark supports many languages including English, German and French. Also there are many settings but the software shows you what these settings do so it’s friendly to beginners too.UsabilityThere are many benchmark tests for different types of PC’s in this software. For smartphones and tablets, basic notebooks and home-PC’s, mid-range PC’s, high-end gaming PC’s and multi-GPU systems and overclocked PC’s. You can also customize your run in the advanced settings. You can lock the FPS, choose the resolution, antialiasing mode [MSAA/FXAA] and much more. After your test you can compare it online with other users. There is also a test that shows you the stability of your PC.FeaturesOne feature is that you can save your results and load them to compare. That might be useful if you upgraded your hardware and want to see how much better your PC after an upgrade is.Like the most games on Steam 3DMark has achievements. If you want to earn them all legally you have to spend a lot of money to buy three or more GPU’s. But there are also funny achievement. For example submit a score that contains 666/1337 or over 9000 in the extreme test.3DMark is a very useful and worthy benchmark tool if you are a hardware enthusiast or just want to see how much power your PC has but especially for these, who want to overclock their system. But you should have knowledge to use the results. If you are an absolute beginner in the PC world you can’t really use 3DMark meaningful.

PC, WinRT, Android and iOS support are all planned, although the Windows and Android versions are currently the only ones available3DMark's version numbers have been ditched from the product name in an attempt to emphasize the new cross-platform nature of the release. This ill-advised gesture is ignored by the faithful and the press alike, including me.Naming gaffes aside, Futuremark has undertaken the long-overdue rework of their flagship product and emerged with a slick package that sheds the weight of past releases and restores the luxurious visuals and sense of style that have been absent from the last few versions.Installation isn't complicated and remains free of add-on traps and other bloatware, although the gigabyte-sized download isn't petite. Make sure you read the latest instructions: In the case of the AMD 7950 in my test system, beta drivers were actually recommended over certified ones. Once installed, it presents you with a window where the three test environments that comprise the suite can be selected for a benchmarking pass. Advanced options let you select custom visual settings, enable demo modes, loop benchmarks for stress testing and view past results.Ice Storm depicts a low-count polygon world suitable for mobile devices and legacy or entry-level PCs. This is the benchmark destined to run on smartphones, tablets, WinRT devices and similar. The level of detail is roughly equivalent to DirectX 9. The demo mode for this world space is particularly well conceived and despite the lower level of detail, may be the most visually dynamic of the three.Cloud Gate is the middle child, designed to test laptops and office PCs. The stately flybys of massive spacecraft and jump gates are a touch hazy here, but impressive nevertheless. This one is for PCs only, which is a shame, since data on high-end tablets would be of interest. The physics test is particularly tough here, producing FPS numbers lower than Fire Strike, which indicates a CPU bias at play.On the high end is Fire Strike, a fantasy-flavored virtual buffet of advanced effects and massive polygon counts that's designed with tomorrow's hardware in mind, although it will run on today's more muscular PCs with reasonable speed. The gaming system used in my labs managed 30-35 FPS with a single top-shelf videocard and mid-range quad core processor. Laptop usage is euphemistic at best, unless you're packing a specialty road-gaming rig. Needless to say, it'll be a long time before anything like a tablet will have electrics dreams like these.Ice Storm depicts a low-count polygon world suitable for mobile devices and legacy or entry-level PCs.

Needless to say, it'll be a long time before anything like a tablet will have electrics dreams like these.Glitches are few and largely attributable to the 1.00 status of the release. Information fields for processors and video cards yielded blank space on some runs and correct data on others. Users reported partially functional SLI and Crossfire support, which is sadly nothing new to PC gaming, benchmark software or otherwise. Also, OpenGL ES 3.0 support would have been nice.Nevertheless, the scope here is greater than previous 3DMark updates, and the overhaul is mostly successful and complete. Longtime 3DMark users will notice that some details available in previous versions are missing from the more streamlined results available here.While this is sure to spark forum wars, the appearance of other long-awaited features such as temperature monitoring seem more relevant to gamers today and a better expenditure of the limited programming resources available to the Futuremark team.Besides, this leaves room for improvement for the next version. Whatever they eventually decide to call it."

Yes when it’s checking your GPU the videos are great to watch, but once you watched once well you seen it.The only reason I have over 3hrs on this, is that I left it running while I went out one day.Do I recommend this hmm tough choice. If you tinker often with your GPU setting etc. than yes it’s a nice looking program.  If you’re not and you just want to see what your GPU can do then no.  You will use 2 or 3 times and then like me you’re happy with your settings that’s it.So if you can get this at a heavy reduced cost, then get it.

It appeals to generalized reviewing of all computer devices, but in my opinion not as good as 3dmark 11 (even though I use this one more). 3d mark 11 just had more tests that were more useful to the average user of benchmark software (the tinkerer). this 3d mark doesn't have a variety of tests, It kind of just jumbles them together (but still does an okay job of separating them enough that you can get a vague Idea of what you need to improve.).

You can also configure it to do burn in/stress testing to see if your PC has a problem under heavy loads. You won't get a postable score with Nvidia Video Cards unless you're using WHQL certified drivers. Beta drivers won't post scores on the website or Achievement Scores on Steam. I usually use beta drivers as they come out because of the added SLI profiles they include for newer games, so posting scores isn't possible for me most of the time. It's a good solid Benchmark Utility and Futuremark has been making these for over a decade now and are the Leader in Graphics and Phys X testing for the Video performance market. If you like to OC your game rig (Especially your Video Cards) then this is a very important utility to help verify the stability and performance level of the system under a load. Of course you need other utilities to completely check your system like CPU and Ram testing utilities to completely check their function as this utility is mainly for your Video Card(s) and does test the CPU under a heavy load."

It has several benchmarks tuned for devices ranging from tablets to hotrod gaming rigs. Each benchmark produces graphs of FPS, temperature, load and frequency, and the online comparison tool places your result next to a set of reference devices including the infamous ""Vive/Rift Minimum Spec"" (an i5 with a GTX 970).My only want at this point is a more interactive comparison showing the predicted score of a hypothetical video card upgrade, extrapolated from 3DMark's results database.

Don't get me wrong, there is the physics and combined test, but they don't fully explore the range of usage of the CPU.For one the Cache usage seems very spotty, getting confusing results when comparing 3.0Ghz with 4.2Ghz. Slight edge on the 3.0Ghz for some reason. CPU clock does play a role but isn't that significant.This is definitely more geared towards GPU than CPU Benchmarking.

Not that much of a surprise since my GPU is outdated (even though it is overclocked), but it also has some lighter graphic choices which my setup blazes through like a rocket. You have a good set of choices. In addition they also think about future or very high gaming setups with regard to 4k gaming. I did not see 3d or oculus setups, but I must admit I did not search for that.The scoring setup is devided in physx grphics and such. When comparing I could definatly see an improvement in GPU overclocked or not. It even shows the clock speeds in the result. Neat. And I can compare my overrall score against other setups.My system does run a lot of games fairly smooth, but it is starting to run behind and is having a little trouble with the more graphic intense wonders of today. I can also see the same happing in the benches of this software. Which means I can do a grphics card update and be back in the game again.There is something to be desired though. I would like to see more/better ranking of my components. For example my GTX 550 against another GTX 550 and its ranking among them. Makes it easier to see how the component performs. You can kinda do that through the website, but not that easy (and is still vague). The score and ranking is more based on your total setup.Pros:Good graphics (something to look at)Good choice of benchmarks for gamingKinda future proof (for now)You can compare your system overal gaming performanceGood when you are overclocking (you can measure and see differences)Represents a good amount of games and performance of those- In all you can get a good feel for your system and its capabilityCons:Ranking system for individual components (more or less absent)Benches get repetitive after a whileYou probably only run this software once or twice, depends on user.3 GB installation (ok, for today standards not that much, but for a benchmark tool it is quite an amount)All in all. If you want to know where your system is at it might be a decent buy, but you could just check out the demo first of their website and run with that. The last sale did convince me because I'm starting to look for a newer graphics card. I wouldn't buy it for full price. There are other benchmarks out there anyway.Given the hasle I had with the license key, I would not buy it again (wich is resolved btw, and you should not have any issues). As far as the software goes, it gets a thumbs up. Very nice tool with a good overall score system (which most benchmarks do not have)."

I will likely use it until some tech shift makes it obsolete.Now I am using the virtual pc to get theoretical benches for what will replace the cards, and plan out my next upgrade cycle.  The amount and technical detail  given is moderate and easy to relate directly to the less arcane tweaks and settings. Along with a couple of other diagnostic programs, you can make sure your rig is tuned up, and you are getting the best out of what you paid for, especially if you are  a gamer.
