,Recommended,224040,9127181,"Posted: 15 February, 2014",all,Stumpokapow,"I really, really liked LocoCycle. It was a fun game. Clearly I'm in the minority based on the overall reception the game has got since release but I really liked it.Just to get this out of the way -- I don't recommend the game to you or to anyone because I'm in the minority on it. A lot of people didn't like it. The core gameplay loop is pretty shallow (you get a shallow spy hunter clone, a button-mashing brawler element, some analogue stick rail shooter sequences, and then a few other surprises that I won't spoil here but they're similarly sort of shallow but still awesome and out of left field). So if you're looking for a deep, replayable game, it's not here. Despite per-level leaderboards and a score attack element, I don't think people will be coming back to this.However, I found the game consistently funny (lots of puns, lots of deadpan humour, tons of reference humour, lots of great visual gags in the gameplay, it's so hilarious), it was always introducing new enemy types and patterns so that any shallowness in the gameplay was made up with sort of consistently new things, there are so many different gameplay genres including the second last boss fight which basically made me drop my jaw when it happened I couldn't even believe it. I thought the 30+ minute long B-movie that provides the game's live action scenes was funny and enjoyable. I thought the audio was excellent, with great performances by the Prague Symphony Orchestra. It ran well on my computer, it looked great in a cartoony way in motion (not so much in screenshots).As with every Twisted Pixel game, there are hundreds of unlockable concept art bits, pitch videos, production shots from the live action movie, and historical stuff--including a sneak peak at their next game which seems to me to be ambitious.I think the game succeeds at what it sets out to do. It took me about 4-4:15 to finish the game with all upgrades, A grades on most levels, all achievements, and look through all the concept art and stuff. This is not a long game. But I feel absolutely like I got my money worth out of it. I'd place it above Comic Jumper in execution, and personally I was pretty burned out by the end of Ms. Splosion Man. That being said, I liked Gunstringer and the Maw more. I continue to think that Twisted Pixel is an interesting studio doing interesting work and I'm glad they're around. While I think LocoCycle worked, I hope their next project manages to find the right balance between core gameplay that appeals to other people and their own unique style.I uploaded 40-ish screenshots. I put spoilers on most of the later game or live action shots. Feel free to take a look at any shots I've uploaded if you want to get a sense of the game. I wouldn't recommend spoiling yourself if you plan on trying the game.Please do not mark this review as ""not helpful"" just because you have heard this is a bad game or disagree with my recommendation. Mark it as not helpful if you think I didn't do a good job representing the game's strengths and weaknesses"

,Recommended,224040,9109135,"Posted: 14 February, 2014",all,Aardcore,"It's not the greatest game in the world, but it sure as hell tries!!Honestly, I don't even know where to begin with this title. I'll be honest when I say that my love for superbikes and motorcycles in general got in the way for me to pick this title right up with no initial reviews or expectations except that it had a bike in it... pretty much never having heard of it in development at all and simply saw it released today, I figured, ""Why the hell not? It's got a slick looking bike in it..."".But boy lemme tell you, was I in for a surprise!First and foremost, the game is a cinematic-spectacle with explosions going off in the game just about every 5 seconds (gameplay included) as you take command as I.R.I.S.: an extraordinarily advanced female-AI motorcycle. How advanced? You ever seen a motorcycle pull Brazilian jujitsu moves on a helicopter?! Yeah... THAT advanced! What a personality IRIS has got on her too... I imagine she must be some sort of distantly removed cousin of GLaDOS--the bubblier, more naive cousin who likes to talk about movies, wants to visit Scottsburg, Indiana, doesn't understand Spanish but pretends she does. Trust me, if and when you play this game, you'll completely understand what I mean...The game itself borrows SO many different game mechanics, I don't even know where to begin with. If you've played Spyhunter, you've probably played this game before... except just as a motorcycle, that's it. As a motorcycle... wholly, the game plays like one of those oldschool arcade racers: Cruisin' USA, Ridge Racer, and Out Run come to mind. It even borrows elements from another unsung classic: ROAD RASH!! Yeah! It even copies bits of Road Rash at some point in the game! Yet further on in the game, I was constantly surprised by multiple other game mechanics that pop up. At times you're dodging things like in a Frogger game. Or button mashing like a beat 'em up--again, it's SO hard to say this game is ONE thing because it does ALOT of things at once or in various degrees throughout the game, and actually does them pretty well to make one hell of an experience.FYI: there are quick time events in this game... ALOT of them, which also add into the rest of the expansive repertoire of game mechanics this game has got going on. And I'll be honest, I'm not that big a fan of QT-events, and I was all, ""Ah man, REALLY??"" When they first showed up, believing they'd be very gimmicky or add nothing to the game; I again was surprised as to how effective they felt and were implemented in the game. This of course could just be subjective and someone else could disagree with me, but in my experience, it was pretty solid.There's nothing groundbreaking going on in the title except that it has a certain charm you can't dislike about. For instance, there's alot of pop culture references in this game, most of them based off movies. And I mean particularly old movies: Men In Black, Big Trouble in Little China, Ski School... oddly enough I've yet to hear a single reference from Short Circuit, but I haven't completed the game yet. Instead, what I got going on here is to let everyone know what I've experienced so far, and it's a pretty awesome game. Again, it's not THE GREATEST title you'll play, but it does what it does very well and you'll have a blast of a time watching all the action sequences which rival up to the likes of some Pixar movies.In short, the game is charming, it has moments where its made me laugh out loud and it's one of the few motorcycle based games out there that puts a ""CRANK IT TO 11!!!"" Looney-Tunes type spin on some spectacular action sequences... I'm still wrapping my head around the fact I watched a motorcycle take down a chopper Zangief-style with its front wheel!!Though I recommend this game, it definitely won't appeal to everyone and that's a shame because a game like this? Taken seriously? You're probably doing it wrong and seriously need to reassess your priorities in where they lie, because you can leave all your serious business at the door before stepping into LocoCycle's house. When you show up at this game's doorstep, prepare to leave reality behind and go back in time to that magical Saturday morning's cartoon weekend we've probably all lost touch with in this jaded age of ultra-competitive gaming going on these days. It's nice to know that a game like this is out there, because I couldn't imagine a world without LocoCycle; I mean I could, but it would probably be a little bit more boring.I'd sit here and finish the game outright, but I got errands to run, a family to take care of--but once I've got some free time to myself again, I'm hopping right back in and see what else this fabulous little game has got to offer! And so should you!6:32PM Update =Finally got around to finish the game and it takes about 4 hours give or take how fast you're able to get through some of the levels, though the pacing seems pretty consistent, so I'm sticking with my guns on this and saying 4 hours. Wow.Just. WOW!As the progression gets further, the relentless amount of action (and even more explosions) never lets up pretty much all the way through to the ending, but it's not about the ending that gets me. It's the journey. Because from where I last left off, again, there were even MORE pop references from movies, but also other video games that LocoCycle shamelessly dishes out with comical effect, making the smile on my face wider and wider the more it got me reminiscing on my childhood past. The devs behind this game REALLY knew where to pull my heart strings on those little details!At this point, I feel like if I drew this out any longer I'd just be wasting your guys' time, and that I might be spoiling some things about this game that you should really experience for yourself. This truly is an awesome experience of a game, and for 10 bucks, you can't argue with how much thought, care and effort was put into this title.Check this out for yourself, people. Because I had a blast playing this through from beginning to end!"

LocoCycle is one of the best games I have played in a long time. Maybe it's because I am simple minded, but I like games that are great fun and not filled with complexity. I had a big smile plastered on my face when I played this for the first time, it was everything I could have hoped for.I have had the pleasure of playing this on XBLA as well. The only differences between that one and this PC version is the smoother fps and nicer graphics making this version look even more beautiful than its XBLA counterpart.Took me 5 hours to beat and collect everything, wich is not bad for a cheap downloadable title. I still think the game was too short as I was enjoying it so much I hated to see it end. :DThe only few gripes I have with this game is the lack of creating a save game. So if you felt like starting over with no upgrades or test your skills with playing the game with not a single upgrade it's not possible. Only work around is disableing cloud syncing, wich also disables saving so there is no posibility to select a level and try again later.Also the game becomes way to easy in the early levels when you hit like a mad truck.Having difficulty settings would also have been nice, with more and tougher enemies.Some of the minigames is way to easy when you know what you need to do, it would have been better to have different options in the minigames so you are always guessing what to do next (Pablo's minigame comes to mind)."

Great pitch, crazy♥♥♥♥♥what the ♥♥♥♥ universe, dark humor and absurdity. They shot some of it live, they pushed the cheesy button to the max. They've done it all.Yet, it only last about half an hour before it goes into plain gaming nonsense. Beat'em all are usually pretty damn repetative, this one is no exception. To make you forget that you just mash buttons with no clear goal in life and waste your time, they give you cutscenes, some kind of story, sometimes puzzles to fiddle with, etc. In Lococycle, the story in itself is a trap and we knew that before even buying the game : the story is a (good) joke. So no story to counter the button mashing boreness. But there are cutscenes right ? Yeah, to tell what exactly ? So puzzles it is ? Nope. None. Zip.Yet, there are the dialogs between Iris and Pablo. That's 90% of the fun you can expect to dig out of the game. But past the tenth time they shoot the same exact joke at you, you may start to feel a little bit too much bored.In fact there's nothing else to do except mashing buttons in any order you may please. If that's your thing, just forget everything I said and make sure to buy the game. If you just like good games, I suggest you shouldn't.To me they've messed up the most important part of their own trip."

As a collector, sometimes it is worth it to have one of a kind, unique, random stuff in your library, and LocoCycle fits that bill perfectly. This game is full of odd jokes (like the ""how to play"" screen on the main menu being in spanish) and a character who constantly speaks spanish with subtitles and is misunderstood by everyone. The cutscenes are fairly high quality with a surely intentional ""B-Movie"" feel to them, and the gameplay is solid. I've owned this game for a few years now, and I put in about 2 hours per year! I kept forgetting about it, but slowly and surely I came back unti I finished the story. This game won't win any awards, but it sure was a good chuckle and some fun gameplay for a solid 4-5 hours. -PR0XIDIAN"
,Recommended,224040,31057985,Posted: 10 April,all,SketchyGalore,"Lococycle is a tragically under-appreciated game.It's like a B-Movie made into a B-Game (plus a short movie's worth of live action cutscenes). It's one of those things that's so stupid, it's brilliant.I imagine it's gotten a lot of bad reception because of people taking it too seriously. It's short (took me about 3-4 hours to do everything), it's not particularly difficult or complicated, and it isn't built to amaze with fancy graphics or high production values (which might also be part of the problem - it was an XBox One launch title). Lococycle isn't a deep game.What it is, is a slapstick comedy spectacle fighter. Clearly it isn't the sort of comedy that appeals to everyone, but for those who have a high tolerance or love for ridiculousness and cheesiness, it's an absolute gem. The fact that it's been mostly ignored since its release baffles me."
,Recommended,224040,9141477,"Posted: 16 February, 2014",all,Robot Hobo,"LocoCycle is a story about a newly-self-aware combat motorcycle, I.R.I.S. wanting to enjoy her newfound independence by taking a road trip with her best friend in the world, her mechanic, Pablo. It's actually kind of touching, in it's own way. Unfortunately, she's not exactly sane, and her translation software has been damaged, so Pablo can't get her to understand that he's not enjoying the trip.""Arcadey"" is the best word to describe the gameplay. Aside from the persistent upgrade system and game length, this would absolutely feel right at home in an arcade cabinet. It's a combination of Road Blasters style combat driving and shooting, God of War style combo-based brawling, and some (actually fun, not horrible) Dragon's Lair style follow-the-prompt events. There's a great variety of enemies and locations, stretching from the jungles of Nicaragua to the American midwest.The intro and in-game cutscenes are all live-action bits in the best B-movie style. You're either going to love that or hate it, I expect. They're suprisingly well made and acted, funny, and exactly as cheesy as they should be. Robert Patrick (the T-1000) plays your equally unbalanced arch-nemesis, S.P.I.K.E., another motorcycle. Freddy Rodriguez plays the ace mechanic Pedro, being equal parts hapless victim of circumstance and quick-witted survivor. The legendary Lloyd Kaufman even gets a cameo in the opening movie.If arcade-style fun is what you're in the mood for, I recommend it completely."

,Recommended,224040,24209292,"Posted: 9 July, 2016",all,Nighthawk,"PresentationLocoCycle is among the most weird games you will ever see, as the whole sentient motorcycle dragging behind a mechanic who doesn't even speak English is only the beginning to the rest of the story that makes even less sense than that. The journey starts when I.R.I.S, an intelligent motorcycle sees an ad for a biker gathering called the Freedom Rally in Scottsburg, Indiana, so without wasting a moment she decides to head in that direction, dragging Pablo along with her for the journey and putting her creators, the Big Arms Corporation on her tail as they continuously try to stop her. This gets even sillier when another sentient motorcycle by the name of S.P.I.K.E pops into the story, dragging yet another human being behind him to aid him in stopping I.R.I.S. This would've been a somehow entertaining experience if the silliness was diversified at some point, but instead the game keeps throwing the same jokes over and over again for the next 3-4 hours. LocoCycle's longest running-joke, the fact that Pablo is being dragged down the road and begging I.R.I.S to set him free while she completely ignores his words since she doesn't seem to understand Spanish anymore, reaches its high point somewhere in the first 1-2 minutes of the game when you actually see it happen and maybe chuckle for a few seconds at the silliness, but that does not stop there, as the whole story until the last 10-15 minutes when the finale will change the phase a bit, will be Pablo yelling random lines of dialogue that are neither funny or read-worthy. There are some interesting movie one-liners that may improve LocoCycle's dialogue reputation, but by the time you get to one of those, you would've already given up on reading on listening to the dialogue as more than 90 percent of it is total nonsense that just gets annoying the more you listen to it.Rating: 4.5GameplayLocoCycle's silly and pointless story idea would've been half sold if the game was fun to play, but unfortunately it is not. The combat relies either on keeping the right trigger handy for ranged combat and just shooting everything in front of you, or melee combat that requires you to press the same two buttons for a couple of minutes without any actual strategy until the section ends and you go back to the ranged combat. There are a few boss battles along the way, but those are just as boring, as even interesting battle concepts get boring as they're being overused for way too long, with bosses that require you to perform the same move multiple times in order to defeat them. There are sections when LocoCycle tries to switch up the gameplay a bit, but things such as the 2D background shooting sections are just as boring, not to mention the fighting sequence that will show up later in the game without any logical explanation for its purpose or interesting mechanics to make it fun to play; instead this section, like many other rely on the same 2-3 button layout gameplay that gets boring once you realize you are doing the same thing, in a different scenery. For the first 30 minutes or so, LocoCycle can be entertaining, especially if you're looking for something easy to play that requires only 3 buttons in total, but anything beyond that is just a rehashed version of the same part, with a different background and different lines of dialogue that sound the same either way. On the bright side of things, LocoCycle runs smoothly, with a constant frame rate and no game-breaking bugs, so if you're up for a continuous loop of the same events, you might want to give this game a try.Rating: 5GraphicsThe overall graphics are outdated, there's no doubt about that, as LocoCycle looks like a 2005 game at its best, but the problems with its visuals don't stop there. The overall design is repetitive, the environments are tedious and the character design is just decent at best, there's nothing really memorable about Pablo or I.R.I.S at all, they both feel like pretty generic characters anyone could design if you'd give them the subject. There's also the countless number of visual glitches that are impossible to ignore, as some objects will show up inside of other objects.Rating: 3.5AudioLisa Foiles is the voice behind I.R.I.S while Robert Patrick took over the role of S.P.I.K.E, and while those are both amazing voice actors, the poorly-written dialogue doesn't give them any credit. The entire dialogue is made up of the same jokes put in a different order with a few references in the middle, and that is something that no actor can make sound good. The soundtrack is good enough for a game of such character, but with all the other flaws, it's probably the last thing you'll pay attention to.Rating: 7ExtrasThe entire game can be completed within 3 hours, but you can return back to each level in order to improve your score and earn more credits to buy unlockables with, something that achievement hunters might want to do, since most achievements require time and patience alone, but even so it shouldn't take more than 10 hours to unlock everything.Rating: 6.5VerdictFor a 9€ title, LocoCycle can be entertaining for about 30 minutes, until you finally realize it will just keep going in the same direction until the very end, but if that isn't a major issue for you, you're looking at about 3 hours of chaotic and pointless shooting, but that's pretty much all of it.Rating Overall: 5.3Check out the full review and a lot more about LocoCycle athttp://gamedragons.net/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=393"

Main characters support that all the way through, making the things happening on the screen even more absurd in the b-grade movie cutscenes similar to the likes of Roundabout.Before getting it you should definetely look up some of its humour - tastes differ, and if you don't enjoy the jokes or akward cutscenes, it may be best to pass this game. If you do like them - take it without thinking, you will definitely have a great time.Main problems for me were bland gameplay (which is usually somewhat fixed by adding new enemy types and upgrades) and clear aim for consoles - some of the controls were horrid.Other problems include optional QTE, weird story arcs, etc.Point is I had a great time and a lot of laughing, enjoying the game all the way through. Despite many problems that the game has, the main characters and the silly story made it one of my favorite games that I love to replay once in a while.PS: One of the best examples of devs making game ""for fun"" of the process - its raw, but filled with fun and excitement to make something new.

I pushed on though and I'm glad I did! For some inexplicable reason, despite the fact that I dislike on the rails games, quicktime events, cringey comedy, button mashing... I found this really, really fun to play.The ridiculous combos, though very easy to pull off, are a lot of fun and it's satisfying, in a 'channel your inner 8 year old' kind of way. Seeing a motorcycle leap off the group and kick the crap out of enemies in a pseudo-Transformers fashion never gets old. The gameplay is pretty varied in general and though Twisted Pixel walk the line of overusing mechanics, they don't quite cross it.IRIS is a good character with entertaining dialogue, though Pablo wears thin quite quickly, unlike his trousers. Some of the acting is atrocious in the video sequences and the jokes within them will miss more than they hit, but clearly Twisted Pixel were going for a campy, 90s-apeing style of comedy, so I can't be too harsh.The game is smooth to play, with a clean interface and hardly any bugs. I once managed to turn Iris 180 degress after hitting a wall but it quickly sorted itself out, and bar one game crash, that's really it in terms of the technical side.Pros+ Fun in a pure, childish way+ Skill trees add a sense of improvement and choice, and encourage you to keep playing+ IRIS is no GLaDOS but still has some funny and generally enjoyable dialogue+ Good campaign length -- the game doesn't outstay its welcomeCons- Reading Pablo's subtitles whilst driving -- poor game design!- Limited replayability- Sometimes a little too easy and simplistic- Weak graphics, in spite of huge file size (no doubt due to the live action videos, which do look nice and crisp)All in all, I can't even rate it out of 10. This isn't a game that can be summed up in a concise, empirical manner; some people would find it to be a 2 or 3, others a 7, 8 or even 9. It is a weird game, and in many ways a poor one, but if you can grab it in a sale, and you've got the HDD space, then give it a spin. Or a cycle, even."

It's about talking motorcycles who are traveling across America to reach a motorcycle convention.Gameplay wise, it's very reminiscent of the newer Spy Hunter games - which I love!

I bought the game about 4 hours ago, and have been playing it since. It is more fun than I expected and runs great on my system with no slowdown or graphics glitches that I could see.An Xbox 360 controller is storngly recommended. With a wired 360 controller, I had no issues, until a couple of sections where you have to target objects using a reticle. I'm not sure if my gamepad was just not calibrated or this was intentional, but these sections were quite frustrating because the riticle kept moving to the bottom, making aiming very difficult. I hope this was just bad calibration on my part and not bad design. The game also did not save any of my progress, so I lost all my upgrades. Not that I mind replaying up to where I was all that much, but I hope this will be fixed soon.If you can get past the ridiculous premise and down right silliness of this game, it can be quite a bit of fun. While the game mechanics are very repetative, they actually threw in a variety of enemies to try to keep it fresh. This game has it's flaws to be sure, but it's my new guilty pleasure.Update: The game is still not saving my progress, and I haven't been able to pinpoint the cause. Maybe it is a permissions problem, but nothing I have tried has worked. I have disabled my anitivirus before launching the game with no effect.

,Recommended,224040,12264061,"Posted: 27 September, 2014",all,Good Old Hoxton,"So!LocoCycle.LocoCycle...yeah.It's great fun. I can definitely give it that. You're a talking motorcycle, and you have machine guns, wheel-to-hand/door/flying-bloke combat training, and that's not to mention that you're also insane and completely unable to understand the Spanish mechanic being dragged along behind you. Quite often, this leads to some brilliant exchanges between the bike, named I.R.I.S, and her 'friend', Pablo. I.R.I.S will often speak using references and quotes with completely no idea what she's referencing, meaning that at one moment you'll be listening to Pablo begging for his life and telling her (in Spanish) that she's insane and should stop so he can free himself, then the next, I.R.I.S is ranting about 'Scottsburg, Indiana' and insisting that she has the need for speed.Major exposition is done via live action cutscenes, which genuinely surprised me, however the acting isn't...the best. It's a bit like most attractive actors: Looks great, sometimes can be surprising in its context, but then when it gets down to the actualacting...well.Let's just say it isn't the latest Quentin Tarantino flick.Ahhhh, what else is there...?Oh yeah, the fighting.Most combat revolves around bike-to-car combat, involving machine guns, melee combat (if you can get near enough), and if the situation calls for it, a 'counter': Pressing a button at the right time to perform a rather smooth animation of I.R.I.S bashing her opponent in the face, or Pablo performing something he more than likely saw in a movie. There's other enemies apart from sedans and jeeps, including jeeps that throw molotov cocktails, trucks that can only be defeated by countering their missiles repeatedly, motorcyclists, and your male counterpart, S.P.I.K.E.Now, the first thing you'll notice about the shiny spiky chopper is just how sinister he actually looks. Almost a bit over-the-top, to be honest. As far as story goes, I.R.I.S and S.P.I.K.E were being shown off to world leaders so that they could buy them and use them for military purposes. However, looking at their styling, you would almostthinkthat some scientist somewhere was designing I.R.I.S so that she would go rogue, even going so far as to paint the female motorcycle purple so she looked more feminine. He also must have had a sick mind, because he also made her quite curvy.Basically, Motorcycle Scarlet Johannesen.Anyway, the encounters with S.P.I.K.E are fairly infrequent, almost boss fights in a way, and all of his lines are voiced by theotherfictional killing cyborg, the T-1000 (Otherwise called Robert Patrick). A wise choice, to be honest, since who else would be a more befitting voice for a hunter-killer AI than the original hunter-killer AI? The interactions between I.R.I.S and S.P.I.K.E show the actual differences in tone; I.R.I.S requests he doesn't 'trip out', and he threatens to send her straight to the junkyard. Fairly moody, to be honest.So, besides the good, there's always the bad.As mentioned before, the live-action cutscenes aren't exactly the greatest, so we know about that.Sometimes, the camera can decide that you want to look over there and not where you actually want to look (Also, the camera can't really be moved. Like, at all.)Most major setpieces are, unfortunately, quick time events.And most unfortunately, this is NOT, I repeat, NOT a full PC port. You will actually have to have a wired controller for this, and all attempts to play the game using a keyboard are made more difficult via the use of 'Press A' or 'Move the analog stick this way' prompts that the game likes throwing at you. If you don't have one, but still want to complete the game, you're out of luck: Pablo's repair mini-game requires the use of the Right Trigger, and do you see a trigger on your keyboard?No?Thought as much.So, while I really, REALLY reccomend this to anybody with a wired Xbox 360 controller, I'm just not able to say it's the greatest port of all time."

However the story line itself makes up for it, and the variation of later quests and the random quips and chat the two main characters say throughout.The guys from TROMA seem to have made the live action story sequences (didn't check this, but its very Troma-like even if not) and this saves the game from being bad.

It's a bit like a rail shooter, you control the motorcycle moving side to side, with a turbo or boost button for a little extra speed. Various minions come after you like guys in black cars shooting at you, dudes in jetpacks, helicopters, robots, rockets, all kinds of stuff. You can shoot them, use melee attacks, and dodge their attacks. Sometimes you do quicktime style events, press A when the circle closes, then hit the Left Stick, etc. Some fights you jump up into the air and start punching and throwing.Pablo, the mechanic who is supposed to work on you once your AI goes haywire, gets stuck to your back wheel and is there pretty much the whole time. Even though you can throw him around during certain combat sequences, he's still stuck there. It's silly, just go with it. Your character, the motorcycle, is on a mission to get to Scottsburg, Indiana where there's a motorcycle rally. She's all about freedom and the open road. Throughout the trip she makes a lot of wry comments and movie references, while Pablo yells back at her in Spanish (with subtitles), begging her to pull over and let him go. Sometimes it's hard to catch what he says though because there's so much action on the screen you don't always have time to read the subtitles.The animations, the combat, the art style, the full motion video (live action) movie clips, it's all got a campy over the top B movie quality about it. It's a very silly game, but fun. Also it never stops. When you finish a subsection of a level, you get scored on how well you did (accuracy, highest combo, time completed, etc.) and then it throws you right back into the next section without presenting a menu or anything. Once you beat a few subsections, you complete a section of a level (2-2, 2-3, etc.) where you can spend points to upgrade various stats and abilities, RPG style. And then finally there's a big boss fight or epic quicktime sequence (usually both) which completes the level. Again, the only menu you get is the brief pause to upgrade. In that way the game is hard to put down because it just keeps you rolling ever forward, never asking you if you want to continue.It starts off pretty easy but at around the second or third level I started dying a couple times here and there. There are no difficulty settings though, so it's a good thing it's not crazy hard.It's a good game, I like it. Good production values, music, graphics, sound effects, hilarious dialogue peppered through the whole thing, and fast paced action that never lets up. Like others said, it can get a little repetitive, so this game is best played in short bursts. Overall though, surprisingly good. It's a solid B."

Random throw-away dialog and script may or may not give a sensible chuckle depending on how many pre-2000 hollywood movies you've watched growing up.On my machine, LocoCycle is pretty darn buggy or triggers bugs in drivers or who knows what.

Over the top, quirky characters? Check. Charisma and ""wow factor"" in spades? Check. This doesn't have to be a complex game, nor does it try to be; it's at the same level as arcade-style, pick up and play, disconnect your mind and let your hands do their own thing kind of game, and I love it for that reason alone: for just being a freakin' GAME."
