,Recommended,224260,29902916,Posted: 13 February,all,Sloria,"The best free game available on Steam. It doesn't demand a lot considering the system requirements, so it will probably even run on a potato pc. In this game, teamwork is the most important element, especially if you are new and don't know how to handle the zombies or how to finish a map (e.g. where to find the objectives or the extraction zone). Compared to other zombie games, such as L4D/2 or Killing Floor, this one is more slow-paced, yet offers an highly realistic and tactical gameplay. The variety of maps allows the player to choose between an either short map, which can be completed within 5-10 minutes, or a longer one (survival maps in particular) to enjoy the waves of zombie slashing."
,Recommended,224260,29885362,Posted: 12 February,all,Rabini,"Another masterfully implemented mod of the source engine, No More Room in Hell will give you a lot of fun.The game uses a more realistical approach on the zombie survival genre while offering two game modes: survival and objective missions.While the survival missions are quite simple, they are very enjoyable and fun, holding the zombies while you wait for extraction at wave 10.The objective ones are more broad and offer variation within big maps, and while some are easier than others they are still a good adventure. Another fact is that such maps possess variation between rounds, so you will have another route of objectives to execute.Most of the maps also contain secrets and special features.You are not a superhero: you will bleed, you will be infected and you can also suicide yourself for the greater good of the group.Overall review:Pros:- Free game.- Extremely fun with friends (the more people you play, the better).- Realistic gun mechanics and decent melee combat while keeping a good gameplay.- Nice graphics (taking in account the fact that the game was made in 2011).- Extremely well made animations of itens and weapons in first person.- Very good optimization (very few bugs, and no performance issues at all).- Good gun and attack sounds.- Characters possess a varied soundbank of quick chat commands, giving you quick communication with your fellow survivors.- The VOIP inside the game simulates real conversation, the far you are from another player, the lower is your voice (you can use an in game walkie talkie to communicate from afar without issues).- Lots of maps with good level design.- Two map types with lot of variation.- Very good amount of guns and melee weapons (arround 20 firearms and a bow, and 20 melee weapons, there are also 3 throwable explosives).- People still play this game to this day (so you will find people to play with you without a problem).Cons:- Few zombie models (you will kill the same zombies all over again).- Some animations of ammo checking are wrong.- Playing alone is difficult in most cases (not recommended to play alone, this is a cooperative game after all).- Sometimes the zombie attack animation can be quite poor (depending on you position).- The music is quite boring (my personal opinion, maybe you will like it).While the game has minor flaws, it is a very enjoyable experience and will bring you and your friends lots of desperating moments and agony (the good kind of it).A good adventure.Overall score:91/100"
,Recommended,224260,29560529,Posted: 29 January,all,DashX19,"I used to play this a lot back in 2012 with my roommates when I was in college. Top gameplay, the atmosphere and zombies are very similar to the ones in ""Land of the Dead: Road to Fiddler's Green"". If you played any of the mentioned titles you know that feeling of being overwhelmed by the flesh eaters with only one hammer and a revolver in your hands.The only problem is that you need friends to play this (you won't have any after a few hours with this game), better if you are in the same room with them, as I was. My playtime is much higher but I used to play on Steam offline through VPN and LAN party because some ports were banned in the dorm."

,Recommended,224260,30158436,Posted: 24 February,all,Novibear,I prefer the modes where you clear a level as opposed to holding the points and getting overun. The game does feel dated but it's still fun once you get the hang of it and it's even better with friends. Kind of like an alternative clunky left 4 dead game. It's free so it's easy to recommend.

One of bests free games on Steam.You can play chain objectives maps or defensive maps (where you can make barricades).If bitten you become a zombie and attack your friends.It´s not just a random shotting like left 4 dead. Here you have few bullets, and must make a good use of them.Teamwork is the key here.I have found 1 or 2 bugs in some maps, where the player get stucks in the wall. But still a great game.-- Better than a lot of paid zombie games on Steam --"

Add water, oil, and salt. Mix.- Add 1 cup flour to the bowl. Use a fork to mix the flour with the eggs, water, oil, and salt. Repeat with the rest of the flour. Mix until a smooth dough is formed.- Clear and clean off a large work surface and dust it with flour. This is where you are going to roll out your dough.- Take the dough out of the mixing bowl, shape it into a ball, and place it on your work surface. Knead for at least 10 minutes or until it becomes elastic.- Dust a rolling pin with flour to prevent the dough from sticking. Roll out the dough until it is about 1/8 inch (1/3 cm) thick, or about the thickness of 2 stacked quarters.- With a cookie cutter or upside-down water glass, cut out circles in the dough (will make about 15-20 dough circles).- Ball up the unused dough and either roll it out and make a couple more raviolis, or wrap it and put in the freezer for another time. Dough can keep for weeks when frozen. Just make sure to wrap well so that it doesn’t suffer from freezer burn or absorb freezer odor.Fill the Ravioli shells.- Take the ravioli filling out of the refrigerator and place a tablespoon of it in middle of a dough.- Fill a small bowl with water, dip your fingers in, and moisten around the outer edge of the dough circle.- Fold the dough in half over the filling, making a half-moon shape. Be sure all the filling stays inside. Pinch the edges together and then seal the edges of the ravioli with a fork. Make sure to press firmly and go all the way around. This will add a “homemade” touch as well.- Repeat this process for all your dough circles.- Dust the finished ravioli with flour to keep them from sticking together.Form the Shells and Fill Using a Ravioli maker.- Roll the dough into two sheets- Place one sheet on the ravioli maker, and form the filling cups.- Fill with the ravioli mixture.- Lay the second sheet of dough on top, and roll it out. This will seal in the filling.- Remove and separate the finished raviolis.Cook the Ravioli.- Fill a large pot with water and bring to a boil.- Place the ravioli in boiling water for 5-6 minutes, or until they float. You can also test for doneness by nibbling on the edges to test.- If you don't want to make all the ravioli at one time, you can freeze the rest- Take ravioli out of boiling water with large slotted spoon and place on warmed platesServe it up.Top with your favorite sauce, grate some fresh cheese over it, and enjoy!"

I can't count how many times I bashed one of them in the head and somehow it was still alive, and why couldn't I use an axe to break the wooden pannel across the door? I don't understand, I was at that for ages, all different angles, it just refused to work.The one thing that slightly saved this was the soundtracks, and the at least up do date graphics, though that part of a video game isn't something that bothers me.

,Recommended,224260,29772090,Posted: 7 February,all,Malfunction,"No More Room  In Hell shoots for a very realistic idea of survivor(s) attempting to survive a zombie apocalypse.Such realism includes:1. Zombies that never stop spawning/coming (You can literally  look at an area, see no  zombies, turn around, and turn back, and there will suddenly be a herd out of nowhere.)2. Random zombies that take 7 stabs to the skull to die3. Random zombies that take several .45 cal bullets to the head before dying.4. Guns everywhere, just a lack of ammunition  (Imagine dead rising where instead of carrying a single gun with a lot of ammo, you'll want to carry a few pistols, throwing them away when out of rounds)5. Even if you use iron sights/scopes you still can't hit the broad side of a barn6. If a zombie so much as lightly brushes you, you are f*cked six ways from sundayA large chuck of the game's combat is seriously walking back and forth to and from a bunch of zombies, slowly killing them with melee attacks / gunshots, and then walking 2 feet before doing it again.Yet somehow, I still enjoy the game and find it addicting, so... I guess I'm giving it a positive review anyways."

You get bitten, You become zombie eventually.I would have recommended the game, but some factors took the fun away. I'm gonna specify those.* You can't join a ongoing match until a round or wave ends or full team dies* Even with stock maps game still downloads some files - which bothered me most* Maps are too small for running or shooting from great distance.* Inadequte weapons and very low ammount of ammo sures that you can't survive long.* Zombies are hard to kill and they're great in number - like pile of gerbage thrown at you.* Not fun at all."

You're welcome for an actual recipe, not a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ copy and paste pie recipe. Trust me nothing goes wrong with nutella.INGREDIENTS:1 c. unsalted butter2 c. sugar1/2 tsp. salt1 c. flour1 c. cocoa powder4 eggs1 (13-oz.) jar Nutella5 Ferrero Rocher candies, unwrapped and crumbledDIRECTIONS:1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.2. Melt butter in a medium-sized saucepan over medium heat. Add sugar, stirring until combined. 3. Remove from heat and add salt, flour, and cocoa powder, stirring to combine. Whisk in eggs, stirring just until the mixture is combined into a batter. Set aside.4. Spray an 8""-x-8"" pan with cooking spray. Pour half of the batter into the pan. Spoon or lightly drizzle most of the Nutella on top of the batter, forming an even layer over the brownie batter. 5. 5. Use a spoon or silicone spatula to cover the Nutella with the remaining brownie batter. (If you pour the batter straight on top of the Nutella, it will sink into the Nutella and combine into one marbled—yet delicious—mess.)6. Bake until the top layer of brownies has browned and set, 28 to 30 minutes. It shouldn’t jiggle when you remove it from the oven. (The toothpick test doesn’t work here, since the toothpick will hit the Nutella layer, making the brownies seem uncooked.)7. Let cool for 15 to 20 minutes, then top with a drizzle of Nutella and crumbled Ferrero Rocher chocolates. Cut into squares and serve.Credits: ★ Billy"

,Not Recommended,224260,30105916,Posted: 22 February,all,Canadian Bacon,"It's actually a pretty good game. However, your teammates are unreliable. There's a severe lack of communication in this game, which is unfortunate because teamwork is vital for survival. In one game I played I accidentally got separated from the group. I repeatedly kept asking them where they are and how I can get to them. Not once did they respond. I don't know why they couldn't just wait for me or at least acknowledge me in some way. Maybe they have brain damage and can't comprehend what the chat box is for. Maybe they have it turned off and can't see what I'm saying. Or maybe they're just selfish and arrogant jerks who think it's funny that I'm suffering. Whatever the case, they were completely useless. So far I am not having a good time in this game because of how unreliable the other players are. I think it's because the players believe - in their infinite wisdom - that you don't need to work together to survive. Because the truth is there really isn't anything in this game that FORCES you to stick together. If you're good enough, you absolutely can survive alone. But it's hard. And I don't think people understand that.The controls are also clunky."

We found it difficult to even escape the room in which we spawned. The very slow attack speed and substantial health of the zombies did not help matters.

Add water, oil, and salt. Mix.- Add 1 cup flour to the bowl. Use a fork to mix the flour with the eggs, water, oil, and salt. Repeat with the rest of the flour. Mix until a smooth dough is formed.- Clear and clean off a large work surface and dust it with flour. This is where you are going to roll out your dough.- Take the dough out of the mixing bowl, shape it into a ball, and place it on your work surface. Knead for at least 10 minutes or until it becomes elastic.- Dust a rolling pin with flour to prevent the dough from sticking. Roll out the dough until it is about 1/8 inch (1/3 cm) thick, or about the thickness of 2 stacked quarters.- With a cookie cutter or upside-down water glass, cut out circles in the dough (will make about 15-20 dough circles).- Ball up the unused dough and either roll it out and make a couple more raviolis, or wrap it and put in the freezer for another time. Dough can keep for weeks when frozen. Just make sure to wrap well so that it doesn’t suffer from freezer burn or absorb freezer odor.Fill the Ravioli shells.- Take the ravioli filling out of the refrigerator and place a tablespoon of it in middle of a dough.- Fill a small bowl with water, dip your fingers in, and moisten around the outer edge of the dough circle.- Fold the dough in half over the filling, making a half-moon shape. Be sure all the filling stays inside. Pinch the edges together and then seal the edges of the ravioli with a fork. Make sure to press firmly and go all the way around. This will add a “homemade” touch as well.- Repeat this process for all your dough circles.- Dust the finished ravioli with flour to keep them from sticking together.Form the Shells and Fill Using a Ravioli maker.- Roll the dough into two sheets- Place one sheet on the ravioli maker, and form the filling cups.- Fill with the ravioli mixture.- Lay the second sheet of dough on top, and roll it out. This will seal in the filling.- Remove and separate the finished raviolis.Cook the Ravioli.- Fill a large pot with water and bring to a boil.- Place the ravioli in boiling water for 5-6 minutes, or until they float. You can also test for doneness by nibbling on the edges to test.- If you don't want to make all the ravioli at one time, you can freeze the rest- Take ravioli out of boiling water with large slotted spoon and place on warmed platesServe it up.Top with your favorite sauce, grate some fresh cheese over it, and enjoy!"

76561198064029253,Recommended,224260,30035088,Posted: 19 February,all,SoulViper19,"I downloaded this game a few years back. I saw Cry and Pewds play it back int he day and I decided I'd get it when I could. I finally did. I mostly played with my brother but after that, after having put nine hours into the game , I dropped it because it became boring to me.The game felt very unfinished, as if it hadn't actually left greenlight. Setting up servers proved to be a hassle, and I found you could only really play with friends who weren't local, was to play on a pre-existing server. Either I was doing something wrong, or this game's Gui wasn't properly implimented. Again, very unfinished and rushed. I'm hoping the sequel will be done better, that is assuming they're hoping to improve upon what they did last time.That being said, the game was fun at the time. I fondly recall shooting myself without any rhyme or reason, leaving my brother to fend for himself, and, in cases I found most humorous, fight off a hord that has surrounded him with no hope of escape.It's a game of survival, and survivability is pretty low with a two man squad so bring mate's for a good time. You'll need to work together, it's very unforgiving. Limited weapons, limited ammo, mostly melee weapons, aim for the head, classic Romero zombies.To clarify, I haven't played enough of it to make a big enough review, this is just my initial impressions from the nine hours I gathered, I haven't even touched the game in over two years so if they've made improvements to the Gui, which I doubt, I wouldn't know.My hopes for the sequel, is that they focus more on developing the server setup, map selection, gameplay. The realistic approach they've taken is perfect, what I mean is, character customization, that seems to be very lacking in this game, if not implimented badly from my experience. Better maps would be nice too. And a Steam workshop if at all possible. I wouldn't mind downloading a Raccoon City based map and playing with some buds with that.I fully trust the Dev team and understand if they can't focus real big like that. We'll have to see but that's half my hopes for the sequel, which I pray will improve over this game.I stand on neutural ground with this game, but I do approve it, only to people looking for a good co-op Zombie game that is as realistic as it can be.I wish the developers goodluck with the sequel."

Miranda was infected, she didn't tell us, bit her own son. Gerald didn't have the guts to kill them, let alone a child. Put a bullet into their skulls, the kid begged not to die. Just me and Gerald left, three more in the chamber, gotta make em' count. Sea of bodies, coming straight at us, we need to get on that train fast. We ran, pushing them away, the train started up again, Gerald is slowing me down. I managed get on, but that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ grabbed my leg, I kicked him off, saw him get torn apart, his eyes filled with hatred. At least I'm alive.For a free game, this is a masterpiece. Soundtrack is spot-on, my personal favourite being To Freedom. The game is daunting and unforgiving with scarce ammo, infection and the hordes of zombies clawing at your soul. This game forces you to make hard decisions, such as either hiding the fact that you're infected, sharing precious loot or even killing your own teammate. Despite playing for 51 hour as of February 21 2017, I managed to master techniques and most weapons, I got 12 headshots in five seconds when being surrounded by Zekes in the church map, but still I'm a frightened duck when playing solo. All in all, this game is glorious, even topping most AAA zombie games out there.10/10"

VVVVRRMMMMM-you can mass murder zombies.-you play online.-has different playstyles, so you can be a melee person, explosives person or gun person.-free to play-runs quite smoothly for my (slow) laptop, even with the higher settings.-some guns have burst fire, single fire, and auto fire, and you can change between them.Cons:-there are few zombie models, particularly for the kid zombies, as there are only two for them.-there is a range of guns, but more guns would be, of course, better.-you can't change the attachments on a gun.Overall, i recommend NMRIH, but since the second one is coming out soon, i would play this until it comes out."

I suggest this game even though its a few years old coming from the Half-Life 2 engine.CONSThere  are some missing 'features' but I can tolerate it since this game was developed as a mod for HL2, Those that are lacking are like proning, broken animations, more missions, probably a capability for a player to become a zombie like in Contagion. Hmmm, also different categories of zombies like for example, runner, raging zombie or a aggressive ghoul which is very fast. Plus we need more variety of weapons.OVERALLThis game is very unique in a way that people will love and enjoy playing over and over again, The replayability is endless especially with more friends in tthe picture. This game deservers a remake although I heard that they (Developers of NMRIH) are making NMRIH 2 running in Unreal Engine instead of Source Engine, That'll be cool since Unreal has nice graphics and features. I hope when they release NMRIH 2 I suggest that it will be purchasable since the developers created a amazing game same as the old one but even better!No More Room In Hell 2 development (Click the text)WebsiteTeaser TrailerP.S.NMRIH 2 will be released soon in early2017!#Hype#HypeIsReal#HypeTrain#NMRIH2#NMRIH2Hype#Discussions_QuoteBlock_AuthorReviewed by Wahlols"
