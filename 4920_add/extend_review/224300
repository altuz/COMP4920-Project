,Recommended,224300,8107639,"Posted: 18 December, 2013",all,Ov3RT4K3R,"Legacy of Kain: Defiance is the fifth game in a series of highly story-focused games that technically fall under the category of action.In Defiance, control alternates between the series' two protagonists, Kain and Raziel in the world of Nosgoth.The story to Defiance is extremely well done. It picks up shortly after the events of LoK: Soul Reaver 2. Raziel has managed to pospone his fate, and Kain still lurks around in the shadows, trying to discover ways to restore balance to the world of Nosgoth.In a departure for the series, the game takes a more action-based approach to combat and gameplay. You no longer have to toss enemies into lakes or fire to kill them (though that’s still an option in many places), but instead what you get is more enemy variety and much tougher battles. Kain and Raziel’s skills are largely interchangeable, with both playing the same. Except Kain is stronger and Raziel is faster. Both, once fully experienced, can pull off insane combos.As the other games of the series, Defiance has puzzles as well, some more grueling than others. But all rather cleverly designed.The Legacy of Kain series has some of the highest quality voice acting around. The entire cast brings all of the characters to life, from the protagonists to the ever-embittered Vorador, melencholy Janos, devious Moebius, even the vampire hunters and undead.The graphics in this game are the best in the series so far. The characters are all well designed and the use of Gothic backgrounds suits the game well.Legacy of Kain: Defiance delivers what it promised, the continuation of the series that answers more questions then it proposes, a refined combat system and replay value. This game will be sure to twist and make that brain think through it's depth-full storyline.Sounds 10/10Graphics 9/10Gameplay 9/10Atmosphere 10/10If you liked my review, please feel free to follow me and/or my curator group:http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ov3RT4K3R/myworkshopfiles/?section=guideshttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/orcollective#curationAlso feel free to check out my YouTube Channel:https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC83DYCmrWfl9ttrhX54jmWA"

The camera will be the bane of your life.  Anyone who has played the past installments to this fantastic series will know that the camera worked fine, no need to change it.  However, some bright spark decided otherwise.  Also, having played this game on console in the past, I found the keyboard controls quite frustrating.However, bad stuff aside, I would still recommend this game for anyone who is a fan of the FANTASTIC story to this game series.

The places aren't as re-memorable since most of these places take place in a ""very"" dying Nosgoth. And it's either forest areas, ruins, etc.The controls are much bettter than the past two games. However, i still recommend getting a controller and using a Xpadder or whatever program suits you best. The only tiny frustration with this game is it's controlled camera. You can obviously spot this when playing as Kain. Everything however is pretty straight forward.I highly recommend playing the past games to fully understand what is going on in Defiance.

And once you get your controller set up the way you like it, the characters are responsive and it feels good to wreak havoc on whatever decided to cross your path. It's not all sunshine and daisies though. If you've played previous games in the series, you know the camera was decent. It wasn't great in previous installments, but good enough to get by with. In Defiance on the other hand, they seemed to think that cinematic camera angles would make for a more enjoyable experience. Anybody remember the cinematic camera angles of the early Resident Evil games? Well, they were alright compared to this. Your ability to navigate the world is destroyed by the fact that it is impossible to get your bearings when you're unable to actually look around. All in all, it's worth a playthrough if you can ignore the camera issues (you won't be able to, I assure you). At the very least, go to youtube and watch the story there."

,Recommended,224300,10423697,"Posted: 10 June, 2014",all,Arakanga.Ra,"As much as I love this game, I have to say that it's not for everyone. First of all, you should understand that this is the last part of Legacy of Kain pentalogy. Yes, pentalogy. Unfortunately, the very first part, Blood Omen, is not sold by Steam. Shame, because it's one of the best classical RPGs. But back to Defiance.Gameplay-wise, this game isn't really special. It's a specific hack-and-slash game with several action adventure elements. There are some very frustrating moments with cameras and it's best played on gamepad (though I had some problems with remapping the buttons). If you are a keyboard player, then no problem, but you'll need to change the controls to your liking. You can't really change the graphics and even though the characters or environment don't look very bad, it's evident that the game was released in 2003. And, since this is the pentalogy's conclusion, if you don't know the story, you'll miss the best part of this game.Now for the good parts. First of all, for the first time in the series, the game is not only about Kain (Blood Omen) or Raziel (Soul Reaver), but about both. In odd levels you play as Kain, in the even ones as Raziel. Though both are similar in their range of movements and controls, there are some significant differences (Reavers, realm-shifting). This changing of characters allows the game to run two separate, yet connected story lines. To continue, Legacy of Kain series have always been known for atmospherical, original music (by Kurt Harland). The soudtrack is flawless. The characters are memorable, they've come a long journey and I can honestly say that Legacy of Kain has the most developed and believable characters I've seen in the gaming world. The voice acters did an amazing job - my personal favorite is Michael Bell as Raziel, but there isn't a single poorly dubbed character. And the story. If you like complicated, dramatic and epic stories, Legacy of Kain is the best you can get. The story combines both personal tragedies and events that affect the whole world of Nosgoth. It's very strong, some scenes will just leave you breathless.To conclude - even though it's somewhat linear and the gameplay shifted from action adventure to more hack-and-slash type, the game is fun and I recommend it. I'd say that even a person who never played a Legacy of Kain game before can play it and enjoy it, but if you want a truly memorable experience, play the previous games and save this for the last. It's a great finale of an escalating story that no fan of epic stories should miss."

,Recommended,224300,33911254,Posted: 30 July,all,Mr. Matt,"I miss this series' storyline. Defiance has the best combat gameplay in my opinion, in terms of just 'how good it feels to swing a sword."" It also mixes things up by having you alternate in each level from playing as Kain to playing as Raziel, and so on and so forth, with each on his own journey in Nosgoth, taking care of business.""Forging the Soul Reaver"" is a bit overused, though. You'll repeatedly imbue your sword with a different element to get through a different lock. I think this is a bit lazy on the part of the developer, and would have preferred something less repetitive. That said, switching characters helps to get rid of that, along with a nice amount of cutscenes throughout the game (about 1 hour and 50 minutes, which you can actually watch on YouTube if you only care about storylines. The series has a good plot and if that's your plan, Google to figure out the order of the games and watch their cutscenes in the appropriate order.This is a pretty good PC port, featuring mouse and keyboard controls with button mapping that works (couldn't use a mouse in SR1, and button mapping wasn't working properly for me in SR2). Striking an enemy with Kain's sword sounds like striking a person with a blunt object, which is a little silly, but it's still pretty satisfying for a game that's approaching 15 years old now.I do recommend the game because the gameplay is pretty decent and the cutscenes/story are rather entertaining with exquisite voice acting."

The story is brilliant, as always, as is the voice acting. The gameplay is a bit of a mixed bag.To start with: the camera. The camera is no longer a chase-cam, like the last 3 games. Instead, it's a kind of Devil May Cry camera that shifts, rotates and generally gets on your nerves. It frequently changes when you are in the middle of performing a precise action, like jumping - which screws up what you were doing.Secondly: too much repetitive combat. Okay, to be fair, the other games have also suffered from this, but LoK seems to simply have more of it. It gets tiresome and I found myself avoiding combat wherever possible. Certain levels have you running backwards and forth with wave after wave of enemy re-spawning after every battle. It gets annoying very quickly.Those things aside, the rest of the game is pretty solid. It looks lovely, sounds great and the puzzles are a little more diverse than titles such as BO2. Story is great and it is good fun to be able to play both Kain and Raziel (although bar some animation differences, they play very similar to each other). The main difference between the two is that Raziel is blessed with more engrossing puzzles, while Kain is simply given more enemies to mash. Raziel also has the spectral realm to play around in, which of course, Kain does not have.LoK fans will like it (as I have), but it leaves you wondering just what they could have accomplished with the format - and such a shame that certain elements were not improved upon.Jimbo Rating: 6/10"

Unlike SR1 & SR2, I have encountered a bug that needed to be fixed before being able to play. Iconic combat and puzzles remained also in this part of LoK series although both have been altered a bit to fit the story line. The game remains challenging but I dislike that they removed the mechanic of shifting between physical and spectral realm, thus making death permanent for Raziel and it creates a need to reload. Story wise it does make sense however and they replaced it with swtiching between Raziel and Kain (not when you want though). Boss fights are great again and they learned their lesson from SR2. Story and narrative is REALLY why I love this series of games! The writers had to tackle the usual time-travel issues but I think they managed to pull it off in the end with the whole alternate timeline. Voice acting remained excellent and Defiance has a really cool soundtrack too. Finally, the game builds up for the finale and gives us awesome boss battles, including the final one. The story of Raziel the Soul Reaver ends in an epic way and is a must for fans of the series. Overall a good game that finishes off the LoK series and I recommend it if you can get past the bugs and older graphics.P.S.:in my case the issue was that the game DOES NOT SUPPORT MULTIPLE MONITORS.

The action segments often come to have a gruesomely satisfying feel to them, and are kept interesting by unlocking various combo attacks throughout the game.If you have played the Soul Reaver games, you will probably be absolutely horrified by the camera controls (or lack therof) in this game, at least I was. I went as far as trying to install a 3rd party application to make the camera more akin to the earlier games. When that didn't work out, I begrudgingly decided to give it a go anyway. Don't despair! It IS possible to get used to, and in the process you get a kind of increased cinematic feeling, which is very suitable for the epic scale of the story at this point.Throughout the game you will encounter both boss fights and puzzles, but honestly nothing as inventive as Soul Reaver 1 and 2 respectively.

On the other hand, throughout the older game, Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver does freeze on you if you have more than one driver operating the game at once. I do not know why exactly, but it chooses to freeze for that reason. Anyway, I highly recommend that all the other people out there get this video game, I rate it 9/10."

Too bad itll be one short since Legacy of Kain: Blood Omen can't make it a complete set.-A wonderful story, exposition, and ending that makes you feel like you're reading a fantasy novel. The characters are well thought out as well as most of the environments. I really want to take a field trip in the Sarafan Stronghold, The Pillars, and the Vampire Citadel. It feels like spots to just take a break with a book and some tea.- Playing as both Kain and Raziel were truly an experience as each character's story always seem to intertwine as you journey in the same spots that are spaced out between 500 years.-The combat mechanics are a little more dynamic than in the previous games, but still pretty meh as there weren't many moves to work with. You can gain EXP to gain a total of 5 combos. So yeah. Dodging a messload of enemies at once becomes a fight for life! You can't go in a beat em up like God of War, they'll ignore that♥♥♥♥♥♥and give you a hard time.-The puzzles this time around are a bit more watered down than Soul Reaver 1 and 2, but the game makes it up by using different elemental reavers to solve them. It was fun.- The Camera. OH MY GOD THE CAMERA. Back during the old days of fixed camera positions in games, this hurt me the most. Every room has it's own fixed point of view and you can only pan the camera's view away. When this happens, I spend 5- 10 seconds trying to find where the hell I am. It's even a pain because it makes the platforming a total illusion. You can't tell how far you are from gliding to another platform until you fall off and start over.  This goes especially wrong with Raziel as with his movement. When you stop, he kind of has some ice physics going on for a brief second.- Overall: Pretty damn good game. But it's terrible to play with a keyboard and mouse. Get a compatible gamepad."

The combat system is the best of all the series and very competent. The camera, on the other hand, is the worst: it's fixed and semi-panoramic, and it's annoyning most of the times. Despite this, it has a very competent history that solves many of the questions from the previous games (except that filler BO2, stay away from that thing), but, in my opinion, it's not a real closure for this franchise.

Well, Yes and No.The Story and Characters have a very satisfying conclusion which makes you think how long they have thought about it.It feels like they had everything planed since the first game. “Witch most game trilogys don’t” You find out everyone’s fate, everyone’s purpose, everything the wheel of fate wanted them to do.The voice acting is “and this goes for Soul Reaver 1 & 2 also” some of the best in any video game. Michael Bell as Raziel, Simon Templeman as Kain, Richard Doyle as Moebius And by far the best, Tony Jay as the Elder God.But what about the gameplay? Well I thought the gameplay in Soul Reaver 1 & 2 was just fine but defiance tries something a bit different.It’s now a lot more linier and the combat has been overhauled. The new combat system is fun with some unique moves.It feels very “Devil May Cry” like, but not as good.There is still puzzles but they’re so obviously brain dead, it’s like why did they bother? With the other 2 games there is a lot more freedom.Sure both games were linier “Well the first game doesn’t tell you where to go or what to do” But it felt natural how everything came together.Also in the other 2 games you can use multiple weapons. “although the soul reaver is still pretty ♥♥♥♥ing badass” Like Spears, Swords, Axes, Tortches,Etc. I’m not saying the new combat system is bad, it isn’t, it’s great. I guess I just like the older one better.Of course I highly recommend playing the first 2 before this, storywise if you just jump in to this you will have no clue what is going on.Legacy of Kain Defiance is a satisfying ending to the LoK series but personally, I would’ve wanted a perfected Soul Reaver 2. I only recommend it to fans of the LoK series. 7/10"

The combat is very flat and samey and the mechanically bland design of enemy types doesn't justify the hordes you have to wade through on every screen. Also if there isn't a law yet against fixed camera angles in 3D games, there needs to be one. But However troubled the gameplay may be, it's never a deal-breaker.Where this game shines is where all games of the series shine: storytelling, world-building and voice acting. Once you're invested in the story and you reach the second half of the game, you'll get to experience all the major plotpoints of the final Legacy of Kain entry as well as the conclusion of the whole story. It's worth playing for that alone.So I strongly suggest to find a way to play to play Blood Omen 1, Soul Reaver 1, Soul Reaver 2 and Blood Omen 2 in that order and then come back to Defiance."

This and Blood Omen 2 were the only games compatible with a xbox controller. The steam verison of Soul Reaver 1 was unplayable and not optimized at all for modern hardware. Soul Reaver 2 worked great, but was not compatible with my xbox controller. Regardless, I enjoyed this series and can see why it's labeled as one of the greatest gaming series. Players really need to play Blood Omen 1, Soul Reaver 1 , and Soul Reaver 2 before diving into Defiance, which concludes the series. Blood Omen 2 is really more of an afterthought and side story that doesn't really effect the overall series. LOK: Defiance feels more balanced compared to the previous entries with the best of Kain and Razial merged together in one. Once again, the presentation is really well done here. The combat system is a bit more developed than the Soul Reaver series, but still feels a little unpolished. The only complaint I had with this game is that the camera angles are truely terrible, which will cause frustration and headaches due to dizziness! They should have used the camera system from the Soul Reaver games. Anyway the puzzles and abilities are more than less pretty good. As linear as this game is compared to previous entries in the series I still managed to get stumped on puzzles. I got lost in the game mainly due to the annoying camera angles. Other than that the game serves as a good conclusion to a epic series.PROS:+ Superb presentation. Concludes the epic LOK storyline with amazing voice acting and music.+ Visuals still hold up well+ Boss Fights!+ Play as both Kain & Razial! Each with their own unique abilities+ Combat is deeper and more complex than Soul Reaver games/ Blood Omen games.CONS:- Terrible fixed camera angles will effect the experience, but will not hamper it overall.- Combat is not as polished as it should be and can get a little repetitive"

Ten years ago I've played it without one, and trust me, it's extremely frustrating, where as playing it with a game pad is a totally different feeling.I have two complaints about the whole game: requiring a controller to play it fluently was a very, very big mistake. It is by far the best game in the series, but it's ruined by this simple fact, and the camera makes matters worse. It becomes confusing when it's facing opposite angles all of a sudden, and at times it seems made especially to drive you insane, even if you are playing it with a controller.I'm a PC gamer and I don't own any consoles, so I don't see why I would have to own a joystick or a game pad to play a video game from a series that never really required one. Maybe I'm exaggerating...Well, if you are not bothered by the weird camera and (I emphasize this again) you do have a game controller to play this game with, then you'll be pleased with the story and atmosphere of the final and best game in the series.Unfortunately, I can only give it a 8 out of 10, because of the frustration brought to me by the camera and controls.

The Reaver puzzles were better done then in the Soul Reaver series, where quite frankly, all you did was push boxes around. Its a lot more action based then its predecessors and using your environment to secure kills is as pleasing as ever.For the asking price, its a great buy, an awesome stroll down memory lane and at the end of the day, if you want to know how to Nosgoth saga ends, you have to give this game a go.PS: Other then the world itself, there is no link between this and the new Nosgoth arena MP game. I do hope this series continues someday. I feel the world of Nosgoth deserves more then a simple storyless arena game. Plus **SPOILER**SPOILER**SPOILER** although Raziel sacrifices himself to the blade at the end, Kain is still well and alive. I could see him rebuilding the vampire empire whilst exchanging quirks with Raziel's soul in the reaver!"

I recommend playing it with a controller, it will make the gameplay a lot more enjoyable considering it's a port. The environment could've used a little more polishing up, you might find yourself running into invisible walls or standing on air, but never to the point where it because a problem. The story becomes more interesting the further you progress into the game and the puzzles/combat also increase with it. All-in-all, I'd say that it's a worhtwhile game to playthrough if you like a story that takes times to unfold and puzzles that'll sometimes keep you running around aimlessly for a while."

He had just picked up a game for his new PlayStation and I was there to pick up my girlfriend to go out that night. I watched the opening cut-scene of ""Soul Reaver"" and saw Raziel get his wings torn off. Epic. From then on, I had myself a vampire game rich in story and action.Defiance stepped up the game. All the truths of the prophecy were coming to realization. The wheel of Fate drawing Raziel and Kain to an encounter I never imagined. With a great story, plenty of the typical puzzles, and stunning graphics for its time, Defiance is the apex of the story series.Now if they would only do a reboot or find a way to cntinue the story."

,Recommended,224300,14356315,"Posted: 6 February, 2015",all,The Ramby,"The last of the released titles in this franchise.One of the best games to see the light of day. Glorious voice acting, superb writing, deep story, and probably the coolest vampire heroes there - Kain and Raziel (and some other, too). It's grim dark vampire fantasy without any of Twillight BS romances and vampire teenagers. The main protagonists are two badasses that handle stuff as real badasses do - with swords, ripping enemies apart.YOU CAN TAKE YOUR ENEMIES SOULS(Raziel does that)!! There also are some other cool characters, like Vorador (another vampire, actually, the first human-turned-vampire guy), Janos Audron (the true blue-skinned vamp) and other dudes.The game definitely aged, the gameplay feels clunky at times (yes, it can be very frustrating to play, especially if you're using a keyboard - strongly recommend having a gamepad to play it), the combat mechanics are a bit repetitive, but still manage to feel satisfying (slamming your enemies to the ground then stabbing them and harvesting their souls to power your sword - sounds pretty satisfying to me).The soundtrack is stunning! Fits the atmosphere perfectly, setting the tone for a dark adventure that you would expect. Sound desing is good, nice ambient sounds that, too, help set the needed atmosphere.Camera is one of the weakest points in game: you will get from time to time totally confused and will screw up some platforming if you rush because of it.Stay frosty!Level design is more linear (some levels make you do some backtracking, though still linear: it's point A to B then the point C opens near point A,  for example) compared to previous titles, though puzzles are still there and are fine.The game still holds up even with all the gameplay drawbacks, thanks to exceptional story and voice actingLooking for a good vampire game? -Then this is your game"

It felt like Legend of Zelda's grim, klunky younger brother, with vampires and blood, something like if Miamoto was really into Vampire: The Masquerade. It was clunky and had the perfect mix of b-movie charm and over-seriousness, helped immensely by the voice acting. Soul Reaver, basically LoK 2, did the same, albiet more of a Mario by way of Wraith: The Oblivion.The story started going crazy with Soul Reaver 2, which featured time travel paradoxes, shifting alegiences, and surprisingly good facial acting given one of the major characters has no jaw.Blood Omen 2, taking place in a time between Blood Omen 1 and Soul Reaver 1, has no real bearing on the either game, and is set up by the events in Defiance, which... well, gets complicated.Also Nosgoth seems to not count, although it could've taken place befor Soul Reaver 1.Graphically, it's a solid game. Everything looks like it fits, cinematics are rendered in engine and look dynamic and inspire characterization. Audiably, we have some gloriously hammy voice acting for a very well written game.Gameplay rewards fighters with special moves, and various magical techniques can make fights straightforward, combined with a brief wait time for dying to keep things from being punishing. At this point in the series, the characters are close superhero levels of power, and the game knows it.Also, the cardboard tube cheat is hysterical.All in all, it's a good capstone to a long quiet francise. If this is your entry, you're jumping into the middle of Vampire Soap Opera: the Action Platformer, so you may want to check TV tropes with the spoiler warning on.And since I bought this outside of steam originally, please disreguard the play time."
