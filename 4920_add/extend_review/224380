There are many more applications out there that offer so much more. Several are free. And offer hardware support for both MIDI and HID(though HID support tends to mainly be supported in ""pro"" versions)."

,Not Recommended,224380,8158943,"Posted: 20 December, 2013",all,WubblesFamily (twitching),"I would recommend this for anybody who wants to make tracks on their own. While it SAYS that this is the broadcaster version, it does NOT allow you to include your microphone while broadcasting. I have tried. It failed. It says that is only for Pro Basic and Pro Full versions and the mic will only work in your broadcast for the first 10 minutes. So… yea. While i love this program, i was VERY disappointed to find out that the mic wouldnt work.Overall, I am going to use this went wanting to have some fun or something… but since I cant stream music and talk on the microphone all at once… I am just going to have to record myself saying stuff during shows. I dont know."

Just kidding it is ****"

,Not Recommended,224380,28960223,Posted: 2 January,all,(-=Dr Ellis=-),"Absolutely USELESS.. you pay for what you think youre getting. and they want ANOTHER $300.00 (or a monthly subscription) usd to unlock the BASIC FEATURES LIKE SAVING SOUND SETTINGS... save your money, Download mixxx, its free and FULLY FUNCTIONAL. I own and operate Freethink Radio, and online shoutcast radio station, Ive been using Mixxx broadcaster for almost 6 years.. VDJ 7 Was an absolute waste of time and money. The other comments are correct. youre better off just getting the free version. This is a total ripoff........"
