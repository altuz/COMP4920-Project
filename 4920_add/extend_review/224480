Animation.  The protagonist looks like an octopus.  I think this is a glitch.2.  Voice acting.  Overall, pretty good, but the main guy's words are always garbled and unintelligble.  I thought at first this was intentional as some sort of weird joke, but the other characters understand him!3.  Controls.  I press buttons and my legs and arms kind of just wind and wiggle all over.  Game is still beatable, but much harder than if I could just walk and jump like if it was working.It's good enough that I would still buy it with this issues, but fix these and it's a no-brainer!"

Being an octopus isn't easy, because there is this person, a chef(Fujimoto) that wants to turn you into moderately priced sushies. You know like those 10 sushies stacked and sold for $2.99 per plate.Game is simple, you play as Octodad. Then you begin your adventure.Game is fun and the controls are great with cool story! A very fun destruction game with fun story and seriously good soundtracks and graphics.Very recommended for singleplayer or co-op, if you would like to play with your friends and pals, this game is very suitable. Really good game if you want some big laugh.You would never find any more foolish games in Steam.This game is the most unique game ever made...You SHOULD try it out, even for $14.99.Update: The developers updated the game with two mini-levels.

,Not Recommended,224480,8918478,"Posted: 30 January, 2014",all,PSOCecil,"This one is a hard ""No"" to give. At it's current price, for what it gives, Octodad: Dadliest Catch is NOT worth it. The game's about an hour and a half long, for $15? Now, if this price ever goes down to, say, $5 or so, this would be an absolute ""YES"". Octodad is a funny game, with chuckles throughout, the sheer obsurdity of what you can do is always worth a laugh, the silly theme song is great. However, the game feels like it's over before it even starts.The last 30 minutes or so of the game are some of the most annoying trial-and-error types of gameplay that I've ever seen. Yes, the controls are bad, I get it. Having to 'sneak' past people is annoying in this, having to walk across a narrow path as fast as you can is also annoying. Instant-death attacks that go through walls and physics objects are also not fun.But with that out of the way, everything else in Octodad is extremely fun! The writing is silly enough to work, the subtitled blubs that Octodad gives are rather funny at times. The objectives you're given are fun.But that's really all you can say about this. It's just so extremely short. Lower that price to $7.50 or even $10, and I'll change my review accordingly, but at $15 for a regular, non-launch purchase? Not worth it. Wait for a price drop, or sale.Edit: To people saying this review is not helpful, please let me know how it is not helpful, and I will work on adjusting it as such."

I somehow missed the first version of the game (perhaps due to my complete lack of knowledge on the series as is apparent at the start of my video), but going into this game I found myself pleasantly surprised.With all the mentions of humour in this game I was kind expecting some hyped up world full of modern pop culture references where I'd need Know Your Meme open up on the other monitor or something, but thankfully we got something a whole lot better than that. This game is funny because it's stupid. Stupid in a good way. The way you control the character, the way he moves, the way he looks, the way you get caught up in a kitchen table and flying around the room in an attempt to make yourself a cup of coffee is most enjoyable.The story is great because it is so simple. Who knew outside the world of menial task simulators would you find yourself having fun in a game where you go to the supermarket or mow the lawn? Despite having the ability to take full control of your character, as you learn the ropes of the controls you find a complete unpredictability with how you're going to find yourself next, and it's hilarious. In fact because of the strange and unique way you control the character, I found a sense of achievement when I managed to complete something, then had to laugh at myself for feeling that sense of achievement because I managed to get my character out of a door properly.The graphics are lovely and of a very nice quality, it's definitely a nice game to look at. It's simple but cartoony. It performs great and feels well optimized. The controls take some time to get used to but that's half the fun.It's a charming and unique game with a hilariously strange character and well worth checking out. Would recommend!"

What makes this game even more fantastic is the ability to play co-op with 2 to 4 people with each person controlling a limb or two! This makes for a great couch co-op experience, and greatly adds to the challenge of the game. Hidden ties help you to constantly search and explore, and the wonderful achievements give some extra challenges along the way. A thoroughly enjoyable experience, especially with a partner.Pros:+ Cute storyline+ Awesome dialogue (with pretty good voice acting too)+ Unique and goofy controls offer a fun and challenging gameplay experience+ Solo and co-op up to 4 people+ Controller support for a great couch co-op experience+ Challenging achievements+ Workshop support for player made levels and mods+ Well hidden ties to collect every level keep you exploringCons:- The achievement for dying 100 times in a playthrough can be a little tedious (pretty hard to die 100 times by accident)- Overall quite a short story (if you are good at the game), however co-op greatly extends the gameplay experience.My Score: 8/10"

That is why it's recomented to use ps3 or xbox controller, but sadly, I don't own one. So for the PC people, it's hard and frustrating sometimes to pick up coffe beans, pour some milk, or try to climb up slippery stairs. Some levels are easy, and some hard, but like every level in the game, has some difficulty spickes. And everytime when you just fail to do one simple thing more than 5 times, you just want to conteniue, and then you just randomly do it.The look is cartoonish, and it looks pretty. Also the humor is good. And the game has it's moments. So if you like fun cartoonish games with good story, I recomed to buy this. PLUS the DLCs are free, but a bit short.

Cute characters, funny situations, entertaining gameplay.However, it's short. Much too short. I personally finished in an hour, most people seem to be getting 90 minutes to two hours out of it. It has just four short and one kinda long level, and there's so many more situations they could have put our spineless protagonist in for more hilarity. How does he function at the office? What antics does the family get up to on holidays? How's his driving? What does other kids at school say when he comes to pick up his two lil' darlings? So many dadly situations they could've put him in, and they opt for just a wedding, a morning, grocery shopping and an aquarium trip.I'd wish I could recommend it, because I really did find it fun while it lasted.

There's a story behind it, and a pretty nice message too.I don't normally write reviews, but I felt like I had to for this game because I feel like I could personally relate to it in my own little way. Although this is purely subjective I believe that behind the story is possibly one of the most powerful messages about love and acceptance.If you want to hear my conclusion of the message behind the story then read the spoilers below.Throughout the entire story Octodad is trying to hide his identity as an Octopus in his attempt to fit in with the humans and keep his happy family together. All through the game he messes up, he's a walking disaster, he can't do anything without destroying half of the things in his path, you can hear people talking about his ""sliminess"" and general negative comments, along with the chef constantly trying to kill him.I think we've all felt like this at times, and maybe even wondered if we're worthy of love if this is all we do and so many people dislike us.  but his family still love him. They still love this ""Slimy"" ""disgusting"" octopus-man even though nobody else, and possibly himself understood why. They saw the good in this kind and caring being that he most likely didn't and loved him despite his octo-flaws. I guess you could say they also gave him a reason to believe in himself, to defy the odds and ultimately reveal his true self to his family, to love himself exactly the way he is and live that happy life we're all searching for. Ultimately I believe that although many negative comments and hurt may be thrown our way by other people, it doesn't make the good we and others see in ourselves any less real.I dedicate this review to my wonderful girlfriend, who saved me like Octodad's family saved Octodad.10/10"

The overall humor of the game takes away the frustration when you just can't quite get Octodad to control himself enough to perform a seemingly simple task without creating total chaos, sending objects flying while blubbering to himself or even getting his legs stuck through objects [and sending more objects flying because of it].It's a game that leaves you wanting to prevail and nail tasks given to you and is enjoyable to play solo or with a friend.

There are 3 ties in each level which you can collect and try get them all, and theres many achievements to earn! some may be challanging but still worth going for. alot of fun comes from this game and its well worth your money, but some sales bring the prices down sooo low!! to sum this up, octodad is unique, weird (in a good way) and loads of fun!!"

It earns its laughs with floppy physics and lots of broken props, but remains fun due to a control scheme that actually works. This isn't QWOP, though the comparison may seem apt. After 20 mins or so with Octodad (and a controller) you should be able to maneuver him pretty damn well.There's a decent length story (3 hours~ish if you move), but there's also a lot of side content and some pretty solid reasons to go back to levels. Add in Workshop support for levels and there's plenty of value here. I heartily recommend it."

It manages to be fun, fresh and didn’t stop me laughing from start to finish with the only downside been that I completed it within 2hours, however this doesn’t mean I’m finished with the game I’m still ready to get the achievements and it also supports Workshop that could add hours of fun to the game.You take control of an Octopus, if you had not gathered that by now, you walk on landing using the two back buttons (controller) or the mouse buttons, I found the controller and Mouse/Keyboard to work just as well as the other and you are tasked with numerous goals per level such as making coffee, stealing cereal, playing mini games and sneaking around stereotypical groups of people.The graphics in the game are well presented, nothing to over the top and I doubt it would win any awards however it fits in well with the game and the game ran at a perfect 120fps even with 16xAA showing that the game is fairly well optimized to run on PC’s.The gameplay is mostly physics based, controlling the character though levels, cant really say much more than that, most of the charm is the game is from this and the characters themselves, dim-witted adults and keen children with a mature sense of humour helps you chuckle though the entire game on top of laughing at Octodads poop sense of footing.I completed the game in 2 hours however I feel for the entertainment value and the price I paid I feel like I already have my money’s worth but still expect me to be jumping back into the game to get the achievements and ties.I’d happily give OctoDad a 8/10, a very solid Indie game, id love to see a full featured sequel that maybe has more complex puzzles, longer story and more levels, besides that this is one of those games that takes you by surprise at how enjoyable it is.- Dean"

It's a short game (longer than DLC Quest but shorter than Portal) and for $15 you might argue you're not getting a lot. This game is fueled by quirkiness, relies on it, really, and its replay value depends on how efficiently you can convert its brand of humor into your personal brand of fun.I got a few laughs out of it, but also a few frustrations. For the buildup to the final boss you're tossed into an irresponsibly designed level of precision platforming, bad camera, and a floor that falls under your feet with very little conveyance. This is a massive contrast to the rest of the game with its open environments and reliance of a more-or-less static world. I got stuck in the world geometry more than I'd care to admit there, but think of it less as a nitpick and more as indicative of the overall game - I feel the developers got a fun toy (constraint physics), decided to wrap a one-off around it, and ran out of ideas. I really do think this game was intended to be $15 worth of game-hours but they had to piece together what they had and sell it.Like I said, I'm hard pressed to find $15 of value here. I didn't try co-op nor go for some of ""advanced"" achievements but I don't think it would have rocketed this game to a glowing recommendation."

First impressions can make or break a game's selling potential and I know I can't be alone in this sort of off-the-shelf assessment. Such cynicism doesn't do this game justice.The control scheme makes it unique and is the true core of gameplay - the adventure game key puzzles would be the spokes on that particular wheel. Some people may allude to ""to walk forward you alternate between pressing L1 and R1"" (thank you Yahtzee) and... well, the trailer showcases exactly how chaotic this is. It works better than it sounds, a description which sums up this game quite well.It's a rare game that is actually funny in its own quirky way, and not by the usual use of 'ironic' references. The entire premise is preposterous but the characters are endearing and the developers included their message without having to shovel in hours of exposition. The length is just right for a game of its tyle in that it doesn't become tiresome or run out of steam halfway through. Overall it all blends together into a game is simultaneously one that I recommend but I can think of no good way to market to a developer. You could say it's an ideal example of how Steam is a great platform for the independent developer to put out quality material on the market."

In the game, you can't move around normally, like any other third or first person game. Since you have tentacles instead of limbs, you have to move your ""legs"" one at a time, as well as your ""arms"" seperately. The game tasks you with rather dull tasks, such as getting items in a supermarket, mowing the backgarden, or putting burgers onto a barbeque. However, because your limbs are just so hard to move, as you have a habit of your body flinging itself around the place, knocking over everything in your path in your vain attempts to control your Octopus.In essence, the game is a 3 hour long slapstick adventure. That's not to say however that it's the only humour involved. The voice acting is surprisingly well done, with the long running gag of everyone not seeing through your disguise, to your kid's often insane requests and dreams, such as your daughter wanting to become a unicorn when she is older, not to mention a Supermarket PA who often makes mistakes on the job, to the marine biologists who constantly pick apart the plot of the game.However, the game has this real kind of Disney-esque humour and heart towards itself, Octodad truly loves his family, and his family loves him back, to his wife and himself actually having a real relationship, even if it is often consciously satarical of suburban family life. Likewise, even the villian is the mad, pamtomine nutcase simply called ""The Chef"", who hunts Octodad because he is the only one who recognises him, and even then, his motivation isn't really that evil either.There are a couple of issues with the game, somethings you're forced to go through vents to proceed, which can be very cumbersome, trying to shove all your tentacles into a tight space. Also, the game features marine biologists later on in the game, where if they spot you, they'll recognise you immedietly, but then later on, suddenly they're fooled by your disguise. Also, the game can be completed in just 3 hours, maybe 2 if you're very efficient about it.However, with it being on sale, and hopefully will return in a flash sale, which is how I got my copy of it, I whole heartily this, due to it's hilarity, it's heart, and just the sheer happiness this game just emulates onto one's self."

Many times I would find myself at a difficult point of the game, but still be laughing my♥♥♥♥♥off and cracking jokes as I flailed about helplessly. What surprised me was the quality of the story and writing the game presented, creating a funny yet heartwarming story of a man who loves his family...who just so happens to be an octopus. I espically love when the game gets descriptive of Octodad's 'blurbs' or the often odd banter of background characters. While the game's story is 'short' by how much content it has, the game's difficulty, its replayability with speed runs and collectables, the Co-Op gameplay, and its custom levels with the Steam Workshop make sure that this game can entertain for a long time.Overall, this game is absolutely amazing for a simple indie title. The controls are as fun as they are frustrating, the story is impressive, creating well-written characters and a world that is both mundane and yet slightly off at the same time, and there are a lot of oppertunities for replayability. My only issue is with ONE section of the game which, while it progresses for the story's sake, is a change in the gameplay I wasn't too found of. But it's a minor thing at best and doesn't take anything away from this beautiful expierence in the life of a true family man (and not an octopus).

The game is really creative as how an octopus is trying to blend in and do basic tasks a human would do...But after the 3rd level of the game Octodad: Dadliest Catch starts demanding you to be stealthy and avoid this and that. Then the game loses itself under generic, bland, and unoriginal stealth missions. Yet is the game still good.

Yet after going shopping Scarlet (his wife) takes him and the kids (Tommy and stacy) to the aquarium. Of course this is when the game loses its charm. Of course since he's an octopus he has a fear of the aquarium. Then after being tricked by the chef in the first game by making a mannequin of Scarlet he is thrown into the aquarium where Octodad thinks about how he met Scarlet (For unknown reasons) The chef finds where his family is and begins to tell them his secret. Octodad comes to the cafeteria where they really know how Octodad really was an octopus. The Chef tries to kill the octopus yet fails in an attempt. Octodad forgives the chef for his wrong doing. Tommy and stacy then ask where they came from and it ends with them having a laugh. So do you notice my problem with this game yet? No? Well lets get to the gameplay.The GameplayThe gameplay is completely mouse based. The controls are simple use mouse1 to move your left leg and mouse 2 to use your right leg. The first couple of levels are fine because your an octopus trying to go shopping, making lunch, housecare, and attending your wedding. Yet once we get to the aquarium...the game forgets its purpose. Thats the big stain on this suit. The game becomes a stealth game...a bad stealth game. Levels 4-10 are basically Hide from this and all this complicated garbage that it makes you get sick of it. Also other flaws are how short the game is. I beat the game in a good 2 hours. There isn't even much replayability to this game though. I loved the original. So what happened with the sequel?The VerdictOctodad: Dadliest Catch is a small yet enjoyable game. But the stealth, the length ruins all of it. The game ends right when it picks up. The game is still fun and you will still enjoy it with fun and rage once your done.6.5/10PassablePros+ITS OCTODAD+Creativity+ExpirementingCons-Length-THE DANG STEALTH MISSIONS-Controls"

I thought this game would be similar to the likes of Goat Simulator - but it's actually very well made. The dialogue is hilarious throughout the game, and the relationship between Octodad and his family as well as his mortal enemy - the chef - are very well done.This game must be played with a controller, and once you get used to the controls - the game works very well and is short enough that you'll have fun the whole time playing it.Highly recommended for a quirky and fun platforming game - definitely one of the better games on Steam.

You must perform mundane tasks to take care of your family, while escaping from a sushi chef who can hold quite the grudge.The control scheme in Octodad is where the real meat of this game is. You can control one arm and both legs by utilizing all sticks and triggers on a gamepad. I'm not sure if mouse and keyboard is supported, but I think using that would take away from some of the fun. You will really have to utilize all your concentration and hand-eye coordination to move with Octodad. Even in the endgame I was still getting frustrated at times just trying to move around, but that's pretty much the whole point of the game. There's plenty of leeway for when you need to manipulate objects, thankfully. Each level has a checkpoint system, so if you fail, which will probably happen a few times, you go right back to the beginning of the latest objective and don't lose too much progress.Octodad: Dadliest Catch is pretty short, and can be beaten in maybe 90 minutes. Most of the levels are entertaining enough that you will want to try them again, either to beat your previous best time or to find collectables and unlock achievements. A lot of fun can be had by seeing how much of a jerk you can be with the physics in all the levels. This game has workshop support, which will add some replayability to the game as well. The graphics are very cartoonish, and work well with the story and whole idea of the game.Octodad: Dadliest Catch was very enjoyable for the time that it lasted on my runthrough. I wish it was a little longer, but Workshop support is there if I feel the need to play more levels. Still, the devs could have added a little more to make this a longer experience. I will definitely go back to it from time to time and see how I could have completed the levels differently. I would recommend this game, but keep in mind that it will take more than one playthrough to get your money's worth.Grade: B"

If you think you'll be just fine with the mouse and you have difficulties with your hands, be ready to take this game in bite sized sittings or not at all. This ""perfectly normal husband and father"" really moves just like an octopus and you have to patiently guide him with difficult controls. If you have any nerve pain, you're going to feel it. Get some compression gloves on, gamers.This aside, this has been one of the most delightful games I have ever played. It's a very delightful story. You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll want to order some sushi! You'll want to go protest at your local aquarium for the liberation of all fishes! It's really an enjoyable game that anyone can play (with patience and practice).The story is sweet. It's a little on the cutesy side, but very comical in only a way a suit-wearing octopus can. The graphics are bright and cheerful. Any catch? I think I've run into one glitch, which required me to restart the game and try a mini game again. Total waste of time? About five minutes. Nothing to cry over.Buy it. Unless you're not into light-hearted things and crazy controls, of course. Of course then I'd have to ask... what kind of man are you? Maybe you're not a man at all!

And somehow it manages to be touching.The base game is only about 3 hours long, but there's so much polish and passion and humor packed into this game that I just can't help but say I enjoyed my time. There are several dozen clever references to other indie games and geek culture, and if that's not your kind of humor, there is also a constant stream of genuinely witty dialogue from the characters.There are some tough parts in later levels, but there is always a way to cheese past them easily if you're observant. And there are lots of extras to find that will easily boost the playtime to 10 hours and beyond.In all, an excellent entry into the ""Slapstick Physics"" genre, and I recommend it to anyone who hasn't given this genre a try yet.

It is actually humorous. I mean the octopus has two human kids, not to even mention if he has trouble getting cereal from the store how in the world did he manage to produce two offspring?! Anyway, it would be perfectly good for children as there is nothing that strikes me as adult content other than the annoying gameplay. Yes, I realize the controls on Octodad's hands are supposed to be difficult, but it is downright annoying to me. I'm an avid gamer and I can't imagine a young child controlling this game well. If they are, you really need to get that kid back in school because they're spending too much time playing games. Ok, that may have been a little harsh because I was one of those kids.

Its wacky physics make the game enjoyable to play again and again. I would highly recommend the game to a friend, heck, even to a total stranger! The availability to play levels that others have created make up for the fact that the game is quite short."

,Recommended,224480,10961442,"Posted: 29 June, 2014",all,Jru247,"Octodad is a wonderful premise; an octopus disguised as a human trying to live a normal life, yet failing to do the most basic of things due to the fact that, well, he's an octopus. It sounds like the premise of a great Saturday Morning Cartoon. The result the game delivers however feels a bit more like the 2-hour series finale to an Octodad cartoon, rather than a pilot to kickstart a great new IP.The mechanic of flailing around, switching between controlling Octodad's arm and his legs works well enough, making the puzzles difficult but not impossible (although some of the arcade games are a real pain to finish). Some of the puzzles toward the end can feel really, for lack of a better word, gamey. Climbing difficult platforms and even a boss fight. The big selling point for the gameplay was that the difficulty came from doing things normal people can suceed without a lot of difficulty but are substantially harder without proper control of your body. This game is like Surgeon Simulator 2013 in the sense that the main mechanic is frustration and like said game it works to the game's benefit.The added co-op feature also adds a bit to the replayability, having one player with the keyboard and mouse control one part of octodad while another player with a controller controls another part. The included ""roulette mode"" randomly switches which parts are controlled by which player after completing every objective. Both result in a frustratingly fun experience for two players.The game's main suffering point is its length; a non-completionist playthrough averaging in around 2 hours. Which is a shame, because the plot is interesting enough to carry you through it and the characters (particularly the titular dad himself) are all very endearing and well written (this is some of the most realistic child dialogue I can think of in a game). The game's humor, besides from the main mechanic, works well throughout the game from start to finish. From various references to generally funny dialogue between characters. It is also nice to see a family friendly game around. I can easily see a child laughing at Octodad's goofy antics and blubbing, or perhaps playing co-op with a sibling or parent.Octodad could have easily been done in an episodic format; a new episode, some new mundane situation made more challenging by being an octopus (jury duty, career day at school, chaperoning a field trip, etc.). The announcement of free levels being added later this summer does give me hope for Octodad. I could easilly see myself paying money for a big pack of levels in this style.In the end, Octodad is a short but sweet title. Enjoyable for children and adults, a good sense of humor, memorable characters, and gameplay unlike any other. Hopefully upcoming updates from Young Horses and content from the Steam Workshop will help make Octodad: Dadliest Catch a classic."

This part did get pretty frustrating and I only got through it by winging it by throwing his legs everywhere till I could reach the next checkpoint.

However, there's a freeplay mode to allow you to go back to levels and be as ridiculous as you can be.I was not disappointed with Octodad. I was even surprised by how much fun I've had with it. The end does do something that will probably surprise you all. It is a short game but its length fits it. With Steam workshop there's certainly much more nonsense to come.

The game is plagued by a huge problem, however, and it's an issue that I actually have with a lot of indie titles: It's too short. In fact, taking the price tag into account it's criminally short. I finished the whole game in just under 3 hours and I wasn't rushing.

,Recommended,224480,8962908,"Posted: 3 February, 2014",all,HWECQI,"I originally played Octodad when it was a small, free game made by some college students. It was absolutely hilarious and it was a very unique concept. So, when I heard that they had a Kickstarter I was super excited! I was very glad to see them get the funding they needed.Octodad: Dadliest Catch is the fruit of the Young Horses team's efforts, and I was not disappointed. This is a game similar to QWOP and Surgeon Simulator in that the difficulty of the controls is part of the charm. You control Octodad by independently clicking and dragging each limb around to walk, and you can switch to your arm tentacles to grab things. It takes some getting used to for sure, but it is always a joy to see you flop around and decimate an entire room while people watch you, completely unaware that you are an octopus in a suit.This game conveys a lot through it's gameplay, which is something that is kind of rare to find nowadays. The gameplay augments everything that is there, and it really makes you feel like someone trying to fit in but having a really difficult time of doing so. When things get rough, you can really feel the tension in the situation as you try to scramble your way to safety.I recommend this game highly, however I had some gripes with it, which are mostly technical.I found myself sometimes getting caught on the physics, like I would try to climb something or move out of a bathroom stall and Octodad would get wedged in the floor or in the wall. Granted, this is something to be expected of a character that is constantly ragdolled and puppeteered, but it can definitely be aggrivating.I also found the game would hang frequently. This isn't an issue of my hardware being up to snuff either, as my machine is fairly powerful and I can play more graphically intensive games with no problem. This is probably due to some poor optimization and the constant physics simulation. It sometimes made it annoying to playthrough.The Story is also pretty short, I was able to complete it within 2 hours. The game isn't too expensive however so this is a bit more excusable, but you may want to wait for a sale, as this is probably better suited for the $5 price range. It is worth noting however that there is also Steam Workshop support and a full fledged tool to make your own Octodad levels. It's kind of awesome, though there hasn't been much content made for it yet. If you are interested in this kind of thing though you might find yourself occupied for quite some time.Despite these problems though, Octodad is a really charming, fun, and unforgettable experience."

You play as an octopus in a business suit who is married to a woman and has two kids. The controls are a QWOP style movement scheme where you move each appendage independently. This makes it really hard to do almost anthing, but the difficulty of tasks scales down to compensate. The awkwardness of the controls works, and is only fittingly frustrating within the context of the game. It becomes a goal of trying to accomplish mundane tasks without anyone catching on that you're actually an octopus, even your family.

But this, however surprisingly, isn't that deterring to the game's quality. Yes, it may be short, but in that short time, they were able to show an emotional story of fatherhood and fear of exposure that will probably get you in your soft spot. The game has so much replay value in it's Free Play mode (Fully unlocked after completing the story), even if it's simply flopping around and being silly. And while the collectables *could* have been expanded, the ties are still a great thing to hunt after.Where the game gets it true replay value, howeverm is in the Workshop. Young Horses has graciously given us access to the same level editor they used to make the story levels in Octodad. So now, in the future, you could potentially expect this game to be like Happy Wheels, the community banding together to make more great abnd original levels, and Young Horses giving new items and new physics to the game.All in all, Octodad isn't for everyone. But if you like a game that you can just relax and goof off with, I'd definetly reccomend this for you."

Instead, the game remains marshmallowy and jubilant with antics such as preparing your own coffee and going grocery shopping... with spaghetti as limbs. The gameplay itself is very entertaining, and believe it or not, the controls (for which I recommend the XBOX 360 controller) contribute a lot to the replayability of this game, even if you can't seem to get used to them.There's no way NOT to get into a giggle fit when you're slithering through the freezers of the frozen food section to get to the last frozen pizza in the supermarket. Few things are funnier than trying to climb UP a DOWN escalator when--let's face it-- you don't even have the ability to walk, nay, *stand* anywhere without falling.

However you must not arouse suspicion or you will begin to leak ink and people will start to realise that there is something not quite right with you.  so the base of the game is to acheive daily activites with your family and avoid the chef that keeps hunting you as he knows your secret.PROS:replayable - this game never gets old and is always fun to play.charm - is so charming you feel warm hearted when playing this game.nice graphics - its a cartoonish style graphics but its refreshing to see this nowadayshard controls - when people say this had hard controls dont assume its a bad game. the controls actually make this game incredibly enjoyable and challenging , its easy to pick up a gun and shoot somebody with it in most modern games but such a simple action like making coffee as octodad is so damn hard you start to giggle to your self.steam workshop - this always makes games better in my mind as it allows the gaming community to create new stuff including levels for the game.CONS:the only con for me is that the game wasnt long enough. i would have liked a longer story with more challenges to defeat, but hey maby there ganna make a new one soon who knows i honestly hope they do.FINAL THOUGHTS:this game is highly enjoyable and would recommend to anybody. its good for all ages, has humor and good challenges.if you want a game that always puts a smile on your face and cheers you up on the most hardist of days then pick up octodad: dadlist catch as you wont be disappointed.if you would like to see a lets play of this game i highley recommend markilpers series whitch can be found here -http://youtu.be/Yj4_A97DL9sor i have my own channel with a lets play series of octodad that continues every sunday at 12:00pm London time. this can be found here -http://youtu.be/vgQpgajrQbI"

Years later after its kickstarter, we now have Octodad: Dadliest Catch. But what is Dadliest Catch? Is a sequel to the previous game? Is it a brand-new game? Or just a remake of the original? Well, it's kind of a remake to the original game, but adds more story to Octodad, and brings new challenges and obstacles to our beloved father in disquise.(*** This Part Of The Review WILL Contain Spoilers - Skip Past This If You Plan On Purchasing This Game***)Let's start with the story: After your wedding, you begin your day like any other, doing chores around the house when you'll be brought to a surprise visit to the Aquirium, where you'll learn about the past life and constant procautions Octodad must overcome while being out in Public. Overall, the story and overall humor is very corny and cheesy, but is still cheary and will bring a smile to nearly anyone's face. It has its charm to it. The voice acting in this game is pretty good - all the characters fit for what their parts are, and it adds life to the game when you hear your family talking about practically anything while you're tossing your Lawn Mower around like a maniac, mowing smile patches of grass at a time.(***End of Spoilers***)Now for the gameplay: The gameplay, well, how can I put it? There is no real ""Genre"" for this title, so I'll put it like this: It's definitly a physics-based game that uses awkward, yet sometimes hilarious movement and action to achieve any objective. It's an adventure-puzzle-solving game with physics being the main gimmick of the game. After the first level, you'll have to perform different tasks to achieve your goals, using physics and Octodad's traditional ""walking"" to get from place to place. Overall, the game is fun to play. As for the puzzles, I will say this right now: The Game isn't TOO Hard, yet after the first and second levels, the game's difficulty definitly rises up. So for those questioning whether or not it's a kids game or not...I'm going to say it's safe to say that this game can be challenging for practically anyone who plays it, but at the same, it's not so easy that it holds your hand all the way through, but not so hard that you won't be yanking your hair out if you fall or misplace an action or two. As for the puzzles themselves, they're all different and original - there wasn't a time where I saw the same or similar puzzle being done more than once the entire game, so every puzzle is different and most of them require different ways to complete them.Okay, now I'm going to say this right now - while the overall game wasn't too hard, I think it's safe to say that the LAST LEVEL IS INSANLY HARD FOR NO GOOD REASON. I only have two major complaints with this game, and one of them being is the last level. For whatever reason, there is a section in the last level where you HAVE to be percise with your steps, otherwise you'll fall off, and will have to watch the same animation of Octodad climbing back up. Over. And Over. And Over. And Over Again. It's annoying as can be. Honestly, I can classify the game's difficulty as ""Challenging"", but I think the developers were just lazy with the last level and wanted to stretch out the game's length. It's needlessly hard, not clever, and was the only time throughout the whole game I started to get aggrivated. Eventually, though, I finished the challenge. And, honestly, I liked the Ending of the game. Funny and Adorable at the same time.Then, we get to my second major complaint with this game, and this is probably the biggest one:***THE GAME IS TOO SHORT!!!***I completed Octodad: Dadliest Catch within TWO HOURS. Two, count'em, TWO hours. For a 15 dollar game? Are you nuts? Only TWO hours. Granted, I bought this game on the First-Day release sale for 20% off, but still. 10-12 dollars for a two hour game? That's ridiculous. Well, the General Game is two hours along. Is there anything you can do to increase the replay-value of this game? Nope. All you can do to increase the replay-value is to either:A) Play the game againB) Play the game again, cooperativly or in singleplayer.C) Go Achievement Hunting.And not everyone is going to be attracted to go out and achieve, well, achievements! Now, me, personally, I love going after Achievements that doesn't damage your mental state, but again, not everyone will want to go after them, making this game have little to NO replay value! It saddens me that this is my ONLY True Gripe with the game. I had so much fun playing this gem, and I still think back to it and think it was definitly worth the time spent on it...but it's such a shame that the time that was spent on it, was TWO HOURS!!!I'll be quick with the graphics - the graphics are nice. I do have a couple graphic-design issues with the game, personally, such as The Mother's awkward model, but the overall graphics are nice, cartoony, and filled with color. My only true problem with the graphics is that there is practically three different models for the pedestrians. Everyone outside of Octodad's family looks THE SAME. Other than that, I have no major problems with the graphics and design choises with this game.So, we're down the final thoughts of the game. Is the game worth it's price? No, but hear my out on this one: The game is FUN, FUN, and more FUN. I had a smile on my face playing this game; solving puzzles in unique ways, walking like a maniac with Octodad, and smiling and laughing at the game's Family-Friendly sense of humor. But when it comes down to it, the game is great and all, but its length is its greatest downfall. Maybe if this game was 10 dollars *At the Most!* by retail, I wouldn't have much of a problem with it, but, honestly, I think it's only worth playing at a friend's house, or buying it when it's on sale. If this game would possibly one day include an expansion pack or SOMETHING to genuinely increase the Overall Gameplay, than this game would've been worth every penny. But where it stands, it's just not worth the 15 bucks.Though, don't get me wrong. The Folks who've made this game put a lot of time and effort into it, and I do hope more is made and brought to us. Until then, I'll be recommending this game to you all, just so long as you get it on sale, and appreciate all the game does have and bring to us."

I liked traveling the world as an undercover octopus. For those of you still deciding whether or not to purchase this game, I will say that this game is likely only as popular as it is because of the controls. While this might be obvious, without the strange controls, this game would be a cakewalk. The entire essence of the game involves mastering the movements of Octodad. After my first playthrough of the game, I decided to attempt to complete all the achievements. Although I did not realize it at the time, this was a mistake. This is not to say that the game isn't fun and doesn't deserve multiple playthroughs. I simply got every achievement in one sitting. By the time I had collected the final achievement, I absolutely loathed every second of playing this game. Nonetheless, the game is truly enjoyable and definitely worth the price. However, like most games, make sure you play with moderation."
,Recommended,224480,9495695,"Posted: 15 March, 2014",all,Zephyr,"So first thing I'm gonna say is that this game is just absolutely stupid. It's funny, it's great, but if you're not a fan of slapstick humour, you won't find half of the humour in this game funny.Octodad: Dadliest Catch is an... interesting game just to say the least. You play an octopus disguised as a human with a family. It's like, what? But, miraculously, it still makes a great game. The co-op feature in this game is absolutely hilarious. That's where most of my 4 hours of this game have went so far with friends. Characters are great, level design is great, and it's quite hard to hate. There are quite a few glitches too, but nothing that breaks the game.I finished the story with a very satisfied feeling, apart from the fact they don't explain at all where Tommy and Stacy come from...The only thing about this game is that it's very, very short. Unlike a huge title game, the campaign is very short. You can finish it in about an hour and a half, and, if you know what you're doing, probably under an hour.  Imagine all the other situations Octodad could get into! Imagine if he had to drive his kids to school? Imagine if he needed to go to a meeting? There are so many things that could have happened, but didn't.Really, my opinion is, if you're willing to pay $15 for a game that will provide with some humour, tortorus co-op and some Community Workshop items, buy this game. You won't regret, and there'll be at least one reference you didn't see in the first time playing. (e.g. In the shopping level, there's a type of pie that's called ""Pewdie Pie."" Genius.) But, if you're buying to get hours and hours out of the campaign, online multiplayer and other things from a big budget game, don't buy this game, because you'll be disappointed. I'm just a sort of person that likes creative games, and this is pretty creative, considering you have to do daily dad stuff as an octopus. Find me another game like that and you'll get $100.Workshop levels are also insane fun, like making zero gravity Octodad and 'Wrecking Blub.' Not sure if you wanna know but find out for yourself.In short, Octodad: Dadliest Catch is worth the money if it's your sort of game, but if you hate short campaigns and what not, but you still want to get the game, wait for a Steam sales to rob your wallet to buy this game.I'm going to give this game a 8/10"

Creating life, loving and caring for it, and helping it to grow into a real live person just like yourself. It often gets a bad reputation in most media, unfortunately. No one WANTS kids, kids just HAPPEN. And they're just hell spawn. It's much better to stay singe and childless forever... or so they say.Fatherhood, while many are often chosen for the job, it's the ones that choose it that are the real heroes. The ones unafraid to raise a child, to make someone else the main focus of their life besides themselves, and ultimately make as many dad jokes as humanly possible. It's the dad code, the unwritten laws passed through the fatherhood of the dads. Not all are fit to rise to the challenge. Some are unfit. Some are thrown into it unwillingly. And some... some are octopi.You have not experienced being a dad until you've been an octopus. Are you an octopus?Octodad: Dadliest Catch, currently on PS4 and PC and soon coming to Wii U and Xbox One, is the touching tale of a dad. It's full of action, drama, suspense, and the endless love of fatherhood. Also, tentacles. Those are great.You are a dad. That's right, just a perfectly normal, average dad. You must do everyday, normal dad things. Making coffee, mowing the lawn, grilling burgers, and taking the family to the supermarket to get groceries.However, later in the game, over the course of many twists and turns in the constantly thickening plot... it's revealed...SPOILER ALERT.FOR REAL, SPOILERS, THIS WILL RUIN THE GAME FOR YOUHE'S ACTUALLY AN OCTOPUS.It's something you would never see coming, the kind of plot twist that just seems nonsensical and wrong on so many levels. But it's there. They did it. They truly have no shame, stooping so low as to turn a game about fatherhood into some crazy, wacky game with a gimmicky twist. What is this, Game of Thrones?Dadliest Catch is a fantastic game, and yet only as appealing as how you feel about the game's premise. It's a wonky physics game. Like someone made QWOP into a full game. You'll control Octodad's tentacles, which are used as crude arms and legs. And that's pretty much the game. There's not all that much more to it than that.The controls are the challenge, essentially. Trying to QWOP your way through an average day in the life of a dad. Stumbling awkwardly through rooms, knocking things over and slipping on conveniently placed banana peels. It's not meant to be a serious game at all. As if the premise itself was not evident enough of that.The concept itself was what drew me to the game, and the masterful execution on such a ridiculous concept was what gave it a special place in my heart. If you can enjoy the sheer hilarity of dumping chocolate milk on a little girl's head as you struggle to pour her a drink, this is the game for you.The level design is perfectly done. Each level has little challenges to overcome, and they're all thought out so cleverly. There are no recycled bits that weigh down the action. And how funny each scenario is only makes each one better. As the levels go on, the underlying stealth elements begin to ramp up. If you goof around too much in public, people might start thinking you're an octopus.The stealth elements are really not the best part of the game. It's not a fun sneaking game, mostly because simply getting from Point A to Point B is difficult enough. But the stealth never really takes over the majority of the gameplay. There's one mainly stealth mission, and it's not particularly difficult. None of the stealth portions really are. The characters you need to sneak around pretty much face a single direction indefinitely for the most part.Unlike something like QWOP, Octodad is trying to be a real game. It definitely ramps up in difficulty, and the final level is as brutal as it is ridiculous and epic. And yet even its most dramatic of moments are goofy and light-hearted.Octodad is a joke. It's not hard to figure that much out. But it's a very in-depth joke. Its underlying sense of humor and the surprisingly wide range of emotions it can convey really make the game. You'll laugh, but you'll also feel something for Octodad. He's more than a wonky gimmick character. He IS a wonky gimmick character, but he's been fleshed out to be more. He's not even the only entertaining character. The writing seems to perfectly capture the feeling of a family sitcom. Octodad's loving wife and kids are cute and endearingly funny. You start to feel invested in them, and in Octodad's adventure. I'll tell you what, going into this, feeling empathy or sympathy for Octodad was not something I was expecting. The ludicrous amount of banana peels and QWOPing around the supermarket, I saw that coming. But the feels? Those were a nice surprise. Surprise feels are the best kind of feels. Especially when they include tentacles.Wait... No, yeah, I meant what I said.I must say, the PC version definitely seems to be the definitive one to play. While it's much better to play with a controller, the console versions are missing the level editor. Which adds quite a bit more meat to a fairly short game.Regardless, no matter what you're playing it on, it's definitely worth playing. It's not an edgy, serious game with post-apocalyptic zombie mech assassins or anything. It's not a rogue-like, there's no RPG mechanics, there's no heated PvP deathmatch. But it's a game about a mother♥♥♥♥ing octopus in a suit.How can you not find some shred of enjoyment in this? What are you, Satan after a do-it-yourself vasectomy? Did you just finish washing your bloody pair of safety scissors? Octodad is just fun, plain and simple. It just is. And not only is it fun, but it makes you feel good on the inside. Like playing in a ball pit full of puppies.I feel like maybe I've learned a lesson from Octodad. Maybe being a father isn't such a terrifying thing. It's a commitment, yeah. A big one. But if it means I get to throw raw meat at my kids and have tentacle sex with my wife, I'm sure it'd be worth it.Now if only there was a girl interested in being impregnated by tentacles...To the internet!"

You play an octupus who is pretending to be human,who also has a family somehow. The levels in the game sees you trying to do simple everyday tasks while trying to avoid drawing to much attention so you aren't outed as being an octupus. This sounds easy enough but the catch is that each of Octodads limbs is controlled seperately and you have to co-ordinate each limb to complete your tasks.This is actually quite fun and trying to do things like mow the lawn while your falling about swinging a lawnmower as you go is a memorable experience. This game is surprisingly structured with a story and levels with various goals which is something i hadn't expected,as i had anticipated a sandbox type game similar to Goat Simulator. What really lets the game down is how short it is. You could easily finish this in a couple of hours which is a shame as it feels like they could have maybe packed in a few more levels. There is a range of mods that give limited replay value but the ones i did try i didn't play for very long.The Good:- fun light hearted casual game- levels are enjoyable and so is trying co-ordinate Octodad through seemingly simple tasksThe Bad:- very shortOverall this is a decent game and though it seems a silly premise i enjoyed it more than i thought. It's let down by how short it is and i really can't recommend buying this game at full price for that reason. If you like casual silly games then pick this up when it's on sales. If you hated games like Goat Simulator or Surgeon Simulator give this a miss. 6.5/10"

At the start we open with controlling Octodad, as you will throughout the game. This was one of the easiest sections in the game. Finding bowties, opening doors, and throwing objects at glass panes. It was a great way to do a tutorial, but as you walked down the carpet towards your bride, it became difficult. ""Don't let people notice you're an Octopus."" And by doing so, you had to avoid breaking things. And after each level there was the small chase with Octodad and The Chef. While running you'd have to continuously switch between leg and arm control as you moved objects out of your path. After mastering the switch the game starts to flow easier.Later on the game became progressively harder with it's challenges, such as the obstacle course in the aquarium. Moving across unstable platforms with lag was quite a tricky challenge, so I had to experience the game with my graphics set low. Also some people might notice the game glitching now and then. Items would mysteriously tear apart when you tried to grab them, or they'd get stuck in walls.It's a good little game, sad to see it finish so soon. The script was funny. I purposely took long periods of time to hear what some of the people had to say. . ""This is scarier than an ocean full of spiders. . And Tommy!"" ""Dad, if you left me here, fish would adopt me!"" I also really enjoyed the story line, which it's always good to have a nice story line for your game. So when you look past the glitches, the challenges and the odd physics with the default settings, It's actually a rather good game. Just I recommend the game for people who have good patience."

Don't forget to flush yourself down a toilet when you're able, because you're a fish so obviously you deserve a flush every now and then.Very soon into the game you will realize that completing these mundane tasks which are simple for ordinary humans are by no means the same for your boneless octopus avatar.

Let's cover the good, first.-It's controls are a special kind of awful, but that's the point of the game. The controls are made to be bad, as you control a boneless cephalopod. It makes the gameplay hectic and fun, while still being managable and controllable if you understand the system.-The humor and writing are great. If you like surrealist humor and snappy quotes, this game's writing will appeal to you. Also, the titular character is very likeable, for what he is.-Similarly to Valve's Portal series, the supply of quotes for each stage is full. You'll only run out of clever commentary if you're stuck on a level for longer than you should be.-For a game with about four voice actors, this game's acting is impressive.-The references are very nice, ranging from nods to other games (""MintCraft""), to even YouTubers (""Total Biscuits"")Now, let's go over the less good.-The graphics, while being charming and pleasantly cartoony, are very unimpressive. The human characters' eyes very rarely seem to move, and the textures are very simple.-The game is very, very brief. It can be beaten in one sitting, if you know how to play it. Workshop makes up for that, though.-The soundtrack leaves some room to be desired.If the issues don't overpower the positives of this game for you, then it's worth a play.

The controls are very bizarre at first, but I found myself getting fairly comfortable with them after playing the game for a bit. While the main story and characters are funny and well done, some of the most amusing parts of the game are in the details; the game is peppered with witty references (seen in many of the products at the grocery store) and amusing details (the stained glass window in the church, and the identity of the ""Best Man"" at the wedding).For me, the game has two flaws to it. The first is that it's fairly short. I finished the main story the same day I bought the game. It does have some replay value through co-op and achievements, but it would have been nice if the game was a bit longer (or had bonus chapters, etc.). The second is that the camera angles get a little awkward. The camera adjusts itself based on where it is you are in a level, but I found it didn't always adjust accordingly if I tried to go back to an area (for example, I tried to go back into the kitchen in the second level once, but the camera refused to move past the doorway, so essentially couldn't go back inside without being completely blind). You can use the WASD keys to alter the camera slightly, but I didn't find this to be very helpful.Overall, I would recommend the game. Considering how short it is, however, I would recommend getting it while it's on sale instead of paying full price..Edit: I nominated this game for the Steam awards. Partially because I wanted to give it a shout-out, but mostly because I was too lazy to write a review for any of the other games I nominated."

The humor is great, the story is amazing and at times sad or funny. very well written, the ending was great some of the cons are it is quite short, with 3 hours logged I've completed the game, although I got my $12 worth there will also probably be workshop levels in the future and one of the bigger cons is it tries to be a stealth game and with the controls being as they are (you just use your mouse to control everything) it's quite hard to be stealthy. All that said I'd give it an 8.5/10, great game"

The controls are terrible, as they are meant to be, and there's really only 1 or 2 moments when they get in the way of gameplay and the game becomes too difficult to control. But even then, the game is still pretty easy. Other than that those few moments, the game is great. Funny, and oddly heart warming. Also crazy weird. 8/10."
,Recommended,224480,8916283,"Posted: 30 January, 2014",all,Death_Reaper,"I preface this by saying I was a huge fan of the original game and had loads of fun with its ridiculous gameplay and charm. After having completed the new Octodad, I feel like a few parts of the game design had missteps towards the end of it but it still maintained the fun and silly atmosphere it sprang from. The beginning and middle sections are fantastic. The charm of being a ridiculous octopus trying to pass himself as a human is fun to experience. The game really takes pride in the charm it exudes and rightfully so. The surreality of the entire situation is what makes it amazing. The premise is what sold me on the game originally and it stays fresh up until some bits in the aquarium.Somehow the aquarium changes the game from being a game about the ridiculous charm of being this octopus man into more of a challenge slog  here you find yourself having to master the intentionally awkward controls. I will say as a recommendation, play this game with a controller because, while the game started with only mouse controls, the controller makes it infinitely easier to play. I feel like the challenging bits of it make a little annoying when I don't think it needs to be but there's maybe 4 sections in the whole game where I feel that way so it's not really that detrimental.It's also nice to see this game explaining the backstory of Octodad, his family, and the chef; at least to an extent. The original just plopped you into this family's life and told you to roll with it while Dadliest Catch gives you a lot of context and I feel that's a nice change but it takes away from the charm somewhat.The game also has loads of extra stuff you can do after you complete the main game with collectibles and secondary challenges; I personally don't care that much seeing as I was in it specifically for the ridiculous charm but to each his own. There are also few bugs here and there which had me restarting a few checkpoints but they weren't terribly bad. The collision can be a pain for sure though. Ultimately, the game is still very fun and definitely worth a look but it's definitely not for everybody."

,Recommended,224480,9056328,"Posted: 11 February, 2014",all,Macabre,"Octodad looked like a very silly and unnecessary concept, and didn't seem like it'd be a game that you would get your money worth out of. I am here to say that I was surprisingly proven wrong when I decided to purchase Octodad. The original game was quirky and seemed to be just a joke...until they actually turned it into a full game. Octodad: Dadliest Catch is very much of a sleeper hit as was Papers, Please last year.Gameplay: Everything you do and interact with is physics based, which also includes walking around (or how others would call it, fumbling around.) It's a weird concept that turned out to be a fun-filled romp of slapping around into everything in the world plus stretching your appendages past the limits into other objects. All of what this game is rounded out to quite a bit of fun and laughs for others who watched me play it.Graphics: This game looks like something out of a Unity game that was made during Game Jam, with some other elements that would be in a AAA game. Some spots looked bland and boring, while others looked unique and dynamic. Don't pass the graphics up as a bad thing though, since it doesn't detract from the experience itself.Sound: Constant slapping around and sloshing of Octodad's tentacles reacting with objects as well as the world itself made for some laughs as it does sound rather inappropriate in nature. Nothing sounded out of place however, though there were rare times when sound clips did repeat a few times in succession.Story: Octodad starts out with him marrying the love of his life. As it progressed, the game introduced mystery elements that were left either empty or unanswered at the end. Lots of plot holes and never ended story parts made the story felt unfinished, but it did have its charming moments. If the story did have more of the questions I had answered, then it would have felt like more of a complete story after the last cutscene ended and the credits started rolling.Multiplayer: Local co-op consists of giving the other player(s) control of either the legs or arms of Octodad, depending of what is chosen in the menu. Up to four players can play, having one person use either one arm or one leg. If I ever do get to try out the co-op, then I will update my review with my thoughts on this gameplay option.Overall, Octodad will most likely be in my Top 10 for 2014 due to the charming nature of the story plus the fun and addicting nature of fumbling around trying to control the character. Pick it up if you want several hours of fun and laughs, or a time waster."
,Recommended,224480,15443229,"Posted: 18 April, 2015",all,Dravvad,"What an interesting little game. When I say ""little"" game, though, I do mean that. If you are relatively decent at the game, then you can probably beat it in 2 hours, or even less. The only thing that really extends the game time is collecting the Ties, which are hidden collectibles, and that becomes more annoying than fun in the later levels.Octodad is simply an extended mini-game. Technically, I've played it 3 times in order to collect all of the achievements. I actually was able to run through all of the levels on my 3rd playthrough in less than 40 minutes. Most of the levels in the game are short, though the first time playing the game will extend that time because of the amount of work that is needed to get used to the game's controls.Certainly, if you are someone to get mad over small things in video games, you might not find this game fun. The game is intentionally annoying and difficult with its controls. It will take you a while to get used to them, and even then, you're never really going to be perfect with them. Besides the controls themselves, the gameplay is nothing too special. Most of the ""puzzles"" are simply to run or climb somewhere, grabbing items along the way. Only a few places have unique puzzles, which are essentially the three sub-areas inside of the aquarium that you visit.But the game still holds onto its fun style of gameplay because it isn't too long. In fact, I think the shortness of the game is good. Otherwise, if the game was several hours of the same types of puzzles, it would lose its appeal.Besides the gameplay, the graphics are pretty colorful, and the humor of the game certainly is silly but funny. I enjoy Octodad's ""conversations"" and it is hilarious how people don't see him for what he is. In some senses, the hilarity of that is the entire game, but I also think there is validity to people's claims that there is a more serious undertone to the game. Octodad certainly feels out of place, as if his being an octopus is something that is ruining his life. And some people have brought up relevance to people with certain disorders or illnesses that alienate them in society, and it is definitely something similar in sadness. Whether the developers were thinking in an analagous manner or not, I don't know.I did not pay full price for Octodad, and I probably suggest not to, because it really annoys me when I buy games and finish them really quickly. There's nothing exactly groundbreaking about Octodad, but it is something fresh. At the same time, it is short-lived, and as I said, it would have lost its appeal if they made it much longer without adding something new."

You're a dad in a (mostly) normal American suburb, trying to live your life and help your family. Also you're an octopus, so that makes things a bit more complicated.I guess it's a third-person puzzle game? Maybe? But it's less figuring out what you need to do, and more figuring out how to use the abilities you have to do what you know you need to. It's difficult to explain. It requires the same sort of brain-rewriting and mechanics-unlearning that you went through when you started to get the hang of Surgeon Simulator.It's weird. It's funny. Most importantly, it'sdifferent. I really think anyone and everyone should try it out. It's worth it."

He finds that the world around him is not what it seems, it changed very much very. So. This. Is. His. Story. He then tries to find his friend Soap but ends up only finding his left leg limb infront of hitlers house. So he then devotes his life to killing people with his left limb. later that day he found a bullet in the ground from digging for gold to pay his rent. he takes that bullet to the CIA department of bullet tracing technology and finds taht it was hitlers bullet all along. this means... hitler killed himself. So he finds out johnny is actually allive. this stuns him and makes him go in acoma. he wakes up in a zombie apocolypse alone. he makes his way out of the bloody horrifying hospital to only find that his wife and son went to atlanta to survive. he makes it there after meeting tyrone jamalkins and his son donavinn. he then sees soap.. his old partner in war and soap took his wife, clarise. so he then kills soap on a farm and the zombies like die. he then goes back to his life but doesnt make any more money. so then he sees that his brother-in-law busts meth dealers that make fat stacks of cheese (implying $$$). so then he becomes a meth cook and changes his name to heisenpus. from then he goes on meeting drug lords and like having a really good story and all. from there he then kills like a ton of people with a gun and is sent to the shadow deef. he then is there for 12 years and has to live off of pooping in a bucket and some soup. a priest helps him escape but dies in the process so it kinda sucks. once he makes it out he gets his revenge on everyone who betrays him. He then leads the scottish army against the british to save his humanity but then is almost dead. Now from here he then gets invited to join the 'Thield' and be part of the 'Bavengers'. He then falls down into a nuclear reacted tank of lemonade that turns him into an octopus. This is very tragic in his life. very.very.trangic. from then he becomes an octopus taking on his old name as a meth cook heisenpus.

The game never really explains any of its crazier aspects, and that's just the way I want it.The controls are very sloppy, and that's totally fine for the first half of the game. The objectives are simple, and the purposefully difficult controls play into that nicely. Sadly, the later levels actually ask a lot of you in terms of precision, and it just leads to frustration.Even with its flaws, the premise and sharp writing carry this game. You should certainly play it, but know going in that it'll cause some frustration."

This technically gives you *more* control over Octodad's movement, but his loose and springy body consistently makes this cumbersome in a unique and hilarious way. Simply walking across a room is a joy.Of course, you'll be doing more than just walking. Octodad's double-life requires him to complete many seemingly mundane human tasks that are quite difficult for an octopus. But if you mess things up too much, people around you (including your own family) will begin to start to contemplate the notion that you might possibly, in fact, be an octopus and not a human. These situations are generally very well designed and fun, clumsy as Octodad may be.Physical/gameplay gags aside, the story is chock full of silly, family-friendly humor. Many dialog exchanges are comedy gold. The ridiculous fact that no one knows he's an octopus never got old, in my opinion. The game is not just funny, though. The main story has a strong and sometimes emotional plotline. There were some serious feels towards the end of the game.Some have complained that the main story is too short, clocking in at around two hours at most.This is short for a $15 game, but there is much more content to be had. Free Play allows you to... freely play around in the story levels without the normal restrictions. Steam Workshop support means that you can download all kinds of custom missions, from re-worked versions of existing story missions (zero-gravity? First-Person? check!) to hardcore parkour courses, etc. There's even a full-featured zombie horde survival map available for download, if that's your thing. And with free DLC planned to add more ""canon"" missions to the game, there will be even more polished and goofy fun to be had with Octodad: Dadliest Catch.9/10Would blub again"

It was amusing for about 5 minutes, then anger and frustration set in. 30 minutes later, I was finally past this, where I promptly quit the game.If you can handle a game whose main conceit is intentially making you rage with crap controls, and you like the style of humor they provide, then sure: recommended.To be honest though, I can't recommend this in general - it's too much of a one trick pony for my taste.

,Not Recommended,224480,9096264,"Posted: 13 February, 2014",all,Wolf Revo,"The premise is what makes the game stick out most: you play as an octopus who is disguised as your stereotypical suburban dad. Remaining unsuspected is the point of the whole game, but of course that goal is complicated by the control scheme. In some ways it is reminiscent ofSurgeon Simulator 2013, but with more ragdoll physics. When you are controlling one of Octodad's limbs you really only have control over the tip of that limb; the rest of the limb and the rest of his body will flop around wherever they feel like. The only exception is that his feet remain planted most of the time.Much of the game involves Octodad attempting to carry out everyday tasks, such as making breakfast, mowing the lawn, and shopping for groceries. There is a ""suspicion meter"" that goes up when people witness you do particularly clumsy things. It is extremely difficult to lose this way though, which makes the game even more absurd.The larger threat is a sushi chef who appears to be the only person around who realises that Octodad is not what he pretends to be. He appears from time to time to try to expose or kill Octodad. When you consider that every other character is white and the chef is a pretty terrible caricature of a Japanese chef, the game seems incredibly racist.Polygon had aninteresting articleabout howOctodadcan be considered a metaphor for those of us who live our lives concealing something from even those who are closest to us. Most people wouldn't think of this though, especially kids like my sister who would just be delighted by the slapstick comedy.There were some extremely frustrating segments, such as going up some down escalators and running away from the chef while trying to perform other tasks. If you are easily frustrated, I wouldn't recommendOctodad.The game was short, coming in at about two hours for my first playthrough. The only reason I can think of to replay it would be to try the coop mode, where up to four people control his various limbs. They also wisely included support for user-created maps. I've pretty much had my fill of the game though, so I probably won't try many of those.My recommendation would be that you go and play theoriginal student projectand if you really want moreOctodadthen you can go and getDadliest Catch. I still wouldn't pay more than $10 on it though."

This indie gem is a classic and everyone should play it. The game is fun and worth your money. There is not too much replayability except for trying to get achievments or getting the ties you forgot. This game does have a modding community with maps and stuff in the workshop and the modding tools are fairly easy to use. This is a great game and I reccomend everyone to buy it.

It's basically what if ""Surgeon Simulator 2013"" were an actual game where its utterly broken mechanics were featured in a way that makes sense in universe - you being an octopus and all. Of course the controls are the reason why you're here so complaining that they suck is missing the point. This does however not take away from the fact that certain sections are just needlessly annoying to traverse. And I really have to say that 2 hours for $15 is just too short. I get that this joke would've become old quite quickly, so instead of demanding more I demand a price reduction. I'm not even sure the $5 I spent during the last summer sale were justified for those 2 hours, but I would've felt ripped off at three times that.If you can find it on sale it's definitely worth checking out, insofar as you haven't watched any of the oh so funny youtube personalities play it for the lulz. If you have, don't bother, the humor is spoiled for you. You may find enjoyment out of the controls but honestly I'm not sure I can recommend it, it's just a bit too unsubstantial."

The controls are the most frustrating thing ever created, I understand this is the gimmick of the game but it's completely uncontrolable. The last mission was terrible, constantly falling into fire because the beam has no foot room, only to be brought back to the other side of the room. The final fight was terrible as well, the fish balloons that you need to use are half the time impossible to pick up. The character would pick up any object but the balloon, just because of this it took me fifteen tries too many.The game is cute and the music is good but it falls flat almost everywhere else. Not worth a fifteen dollar price tag, nor the summer sale price I got it for."

Cons: Awful controls, lack of inspiration and devotion in the workshop, difficult to play, not enjoyable in general due to the extremely repetitive nature of the game and lack of much additional content and very little likelihood to replay after the first playthrough, assuming you just don't uninstall the game.

The story itself feels like a movie or a book it's really just wonderful and sort of unique but extremely cliche at the same time without spoiling anything here's the jist of it: you play as octodad an octopus whose family and the rest of humankind (except for a single sushi chef) thinks he's a man just carrying out his daily life.Gameplay/Controls:The gameplay is great and by that i mean the physics are generally pretty good i haven't had anything get stuck in a wall or under a table or whatever. the controls on the other hand are different at first they are kind of hard but after some practice you'll be jiggling around like a pro. it really only took me about 10 minutes to get the controls down but after that it was smooth sailing.Maps:The maps are great they have plenty of props to play with but also AREN'T overflowing with props because that would make it hard to move. most maps have secret areas where you can collect ties which i will get to later.Collectibles:the one thing that annoys me the MOST in games is upgradable skill systems that you need to use to beat the game, octodad on the other hand doesn't have one which makes me VERY happy you can play through without having to spend EXP to get new skills because there are no skill points in-game anyway. the only collectible is ties which are just new ties to wear and look cool.graphics:I have a toaster and can run this at 100 FPS. 'nuff said.Workshop support/Replay value:IMMENSE REPLAY VALUE the game has SO MUCH to do in every level that you really need to replay it at least twice to get all the content in. not to mention this game has workshop support and my overall experience with it: walked into a supermarket naked and stole cereal from a lady.          10/10 for workshop.OVERALL GRADE: 9.5/10reason for not a perfect 10: workshop has skins for octodad but they have to be installed manually but it's not a big deal."

Although controls can be difficult at times, that is kind of the point.  It is not suppose to be easy to handle.  Your objective is to act like a human while having tentacles as legs and arms, thus making it difficult to navigate.  After about thirty minutes or so, you should have a grasp of your character and will be able to handle the more difficult objectives.Young Horses does a great job at making everyday situations into a comedy.

This game is very short (about an hour long) so you should probably wait for the price to go down to around $7.49. Other than that this game was loads of fun. It puts you in different areas with different tasks to complete with the Aquarium being the largest. It has lots of activities to do and almost all of them are challenging. The ending of the game is funny and the rest of the game is very enjoyable. 8/10"

The controls are wacky, but it adds to the enjoyment of going around as an octopus. However, when the game gets more challenging later on, the controls start to get annoying, especially in the boss battle. If you can master the controls (unlikely), this game is going to be short for you. However, the real gems here are the costum courses in the Steam Workshop. That feature is the games redeeming factor. There's enjoyment to be found here, but for the main price of $15, you're probably better off waiting for this to go on sale."

Let me lay out the pros and cons of this game for you first.Pros- Ragdoll effects are funny.- Not hard to run, even on a bad PC.- Easter eggs hidden all over the game.- Come on, you're an octopus!Cons- Some missions are frustrating.- Camera angles are sometimes bad.- Confusing storyline.- Controls are weird (You can't move with WASD).- If you pause, it only brings up the pause screen, it doesn't actually pause the game.- Places skip around a lot.- $15??? Are you serious??- Unrealistic AI.In all, I recommend this game to anybody who doesn't care about storylines, likes destruction, and likes comedy. But I do NOT recommend getting this game for its full price. It needs to be lowered to at most $5. Definitely wait until a sale.I almost recommended this game, but then I weighed the price, plus all of the cons, and I had to say no. If it's on sale, then yes, but do not waste $15 on this game. I am glad I only paid $3."

This game is extremely fun and is one of the funniest games i have played! i would highly recomend it. (only if its on sale it is worth 15 bucks if you have monny to spare but if you can pick it up for 8 go ahead jump on that deal) the only problem is the games is very short you can beat it in an afternoon. if you play an hour a night it might last you 3-4 days but chances are your going to love it so much you'll end up playing it till 2am. the game is coming out with a free dlc that contains 2 new areas with multiple puzzles wich will add a couple hours to the game. their is 3 neck ties on every level you can collect to add extra life to the game. if you enjoyed this game id really reccomend battle block theater really funny to esspecially if you and a few buds team up.

Unlike other games with purposefully difficult controls, this game pulls it off without the player feeling completely frustrated by turning the gimmick into half the fun.The animations are fluid and the overall design gels well with the story and characters to create the vibrant world Octodad struggles with so hard each day.Definitely worth the buy. Support creative games like these so we'll see more of them :)"

What I mean by this is that the game is too short. I only spent 4 hours going as slow as I possibly could around the levels and it was still too short. Besides the workshop that has a lack of levels at this moment in time and will have me very busy when more levels come out, there needs to be more stuff coming from the developers for the story or maybe something new entirely other than the story. I still think it was worth the $12 but being that the game is so short, I am starting to think otherwise."

After doing so, you have to plow through the gifts and walk down the aisle to meet your bride. But what is this? THE RING BARER IS MISSING. Being the true man you are, you go and dig out the ring yourself. Unfortunately, I wasn't ready for this level of commitment in a video game so I threw the ring at the bride, but it accidentally triggered the cutscene and I decided to quit there.10/10 Would play the tutorial again."

Try to grab the ring? Why don't you fling it at your dear Aunt Sally in the audience instead?-No one recognizes you're an octopus, not even your wife/mother of your two children. Hilarious.-The subtitles add emotion and humor to the blubs that make up Octodad's conversational points.-This game is just as fun for adults as it would be for kids.-You could easily play through a level in just ten minutes, making it easy to binge play or just to play casually.-The soundtrack and voices perfectly mesh with the gameplay and visuals.-I have yet to encounter a bug and I've completed every developer made level.Cons:-I wish there were more developer made levels to play through.-The mechanics can be hard to adjust to at first.-The tutorial is confusing and frustrating. Besides telling you how to lift your arms and legs, it's basically up to you to figure out the rest.-In certain situations you're not outted as an octopus when you most definitely should've, but you look at grandma in the corner wrong and you've failed the level.-The camera angles can be difficult to work with at times and make it hard to see."

I mean, you control an octopus throughout a human world, that is pretty weird.Unexpectedly this is actually a heartwarming story about an octopus’s love for his family while he tries to hide his real identity. The story and humor reminds me of something that could come from a Pixar or DreamWorks movie with witty dialog. Just hearing Octodad blrblrblr when he rides the slide is awesome.Trying not to spoil anything as the story of the game is quite short and only has about 2-3 hours of gameplay. Even so there is a whole lot of replay ability in the levels, things such as to discover new ways to do stuff, find easter eggs,  and achievements. There is also a four player coop mode for those daring enough to complete the game where each player is controlling each their limb of Octodad.The game also have Workshop that of new levels and challenges for those who did not get enough of Octodad in the first round.Now go buy the game and have some fun :D"

There's even an entire level dedicated to slowly pushing ""A"" repeatedly to escape a shark. Thrilling.The game is ultimately ruined by the three stealth-centric levels that follow which restrict the player's freedom to flop about and the final boss fight was less-than-enjoyable.To top it all off, the game is only about 2 hours long, most of which is rather forgettable.Octodad: Dadliest Catch was a hilarious game idea that unfortunately wasn't used to its full potential to create a completely enjoyable experience."

It's fun to watch Octodad flail around and fail, but it CAN get old for some people quiet quickly. I haven't played Co-op mode much, and I wish not to because I failed terribly at the original game, and co-op is about 300x harder.

The first thing to address here is the movement and controls. It's awkward, but calling it 'deliberately bad' is IMO not really true. It's responsive and precise, but the difficulty comes from the fact that you are an invertebrate rather than that the controls suck. The plot is nothing special, though it did carry more emotional weight than I thought it would. Graphics and voice acting is nothing special, but where the game really shines is it's sense of humour. Most of the reference based jokes are delivered via background objects so as not to confuse people who don't get them, and the chatter from passersby is something I genuinely want to listen to, as it always brings out a smile on my face. However, the gameplay is where this thing really shines. While it doesn't have that much replay value (the game's around 5 hours long assuming you don't rush through all the levels), there are decently hidden secrets to find and loads of little trinkets to grab and mess around with in your environment or just extra stuff to do, though there could potentially be more. Still, this game is just about having stupid fun and messing around, as the gameplay perfectly demonstrates. It composes of you doing ordinary mundane things at the start extremely awkwardly, and ends with you doing out of the ordinary things in ways you couldn't imagine. If you have low amounts of patience or are short on cash and therefore want a timesink, this isn't your game, but this is a nice diversion of a game. It also has Workshop support and a decent supply of nice quality user created levels (as well as some stuff done by the devs demonstrating what can be done in the engine). If you have your doubts you can always download the original Octodad for free and see if the control scheme agrees with you, and honestly, you probably know already if this is a game that you're going to enjoy.In conclusion, this is a game that is designed for people who just like doing stupid things in a game and laughing at it. It doesn't just rely on it's physics engine or controls as some reviews might imply, as it also has an fantastic sense of humour, good music and just an all-round good feel to it. Like I said, you should know if you will enjoy this or hate it. Also, they changed the stealth segments significantly and they now barely involve stealth at all, so you needn't worry about that. And if that isn't enough for you, the devs are planning to port the game to the PS4 with new levels and features and then update the PC version with said bonus goodies! My advice is get your tentacles on this game as soon as possible!"

,Recommended,224480,9014552,"Posted: 7 February, 2014",all,granderojo,"Octodad Dadliest Catch is an odd game: Octodad is about an octopus desperately trying to keep it together while he galumphs out the American Dream and be the best father that he can be. Every attempt to accomplish his role within the nuclear family drips with slapstick, pathos and even an unbearably affecting bravery in spots which smartly breaks up the comedy. In game terms, it’s little more than a tech demo fully realized. But on those same terms it’s a game which is feel-good throughout.The game’s controls has you controlling six cephalopod limbs of Octodad’s to walk and fill our your suit while the other two are used to interact with objects in the environment. As you seek to make yourself seem normal to your family and the outside world you do so typically by failing in comically abnormal ways. That’s the beauty of the game, even when you fail it’s more often than not more hilarious than when you succeed. The game also performs well as a cooperative game with children and adults alike. My niece particularly loved every moment she had with the game, and you can tell with how the game was structured that children were an aim more of the developers than most independent games currently on the market.That said the back third of the game is inconsistent with the gameplay of the rest of the game. While true, I much prefer the switch in difficulty and objectives. Through it’s rise in difficulty and reliance on mechanics, these previously trifle aspects of the game were now poignant to the story. The game gives you a reason to have skin in the game, which makes the inevitable compassionate ending that much more meaningful. I never stopped smiling throughout the four hours I played this game. I'll conclude by saying enjoy this game level by level, since there are definite pleasures along the way."

Because the controls are the silliest part of an intentionally silly game, its becomes obvious that the developers don't care about what they release and are just laughing all the way to the bank.

I finished the game in 2 hours, and since there is no multiplayer and the community levels suck (no offense to some of the makers) i just am done.In conclusion, this was not worth the money. The only price i would buy it at if i knew before hand would be 2.50$ or less.The only good things i can say about the game is that: It's pretty funny, the plot/game is decently fun, and the gaming style is very different then usual, so its interesting.Tips to make this a better game:1. A part 2 to the original campaign (maybe 5 hours long?)2. Multiplayer3. A level creator with pre-built stuff so you dont have to know how to make a workshop 3D community level.4. Make it cost 7.50$ if you add the stuff above ^5. Dont give away as much in the preview, it gives away all of it."

Octodad has it's own unique music and sounds, but sounds a bit feels uncomfortable to some not all! SOME.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74jlH_fR61IGameplayBasically is an adventure game with its grossly stupidity to pick a tool, to jump. to pick up thing feels more complicated than everything. the game itself is so dumb, easily the dumbest game i've ever played in years, dumbest than Surgery Simulator.reminds me with ""how to laugh"".Why is Octodad: Dadliest Catch one of the very humoristic games?Ok, it shows weather you're stupid or smart but mainly shows you as a stupid person, like what it did to me! I was trying to pick something CAN'T CAN'T, after 10 mins, I picked it up. It will 100% happen to everyone even the smartest person in the world.Is the controlers so annoying in Octodad: Dadliest Catch or not?Super annoying, I'll say it's the most annoying thing I've seen in a game! Do you love to be in an angry situation? so Octodad is the appropriate game.The VerdictOctodad is a poor experince of gameplay, but a perfect experience of humors.

The main game was super fun, and then all of a sudden it went way downhill. The stealth parts sucked, but were fine and doable and everthing. But where the game utterly fails is the final chase sequence. In a game that rejoices in its own terrible controls, having a timed accuracy section was completely unreasonable. The final chase of this game is more inappropriate than the forced boss fights in Deus Ex: Human Revolution. The story was awesome though, and I definitely recommend trying it, but I don't recommend spending money on it. Let's just say I had less than thirty ""deaths"" before the final sequence, and I ended at an even 330 after it. And I've played the original all the way through, including the challenge stuff, so I don't think I'm that bad at these controls."

It's available for free on their website, just Google Octodad.Octodad is one of those games that is fun because of how the controls make even the most simple task for a human, a recipe for disaster.The game is pretty damn short, but there's a fair little bit hidden around for those who want to extend gameplay, such as a secret level, hidden ties, and the steam achievements. And then there's the Easter Eggs, and little details that will make you smile. And then, there's the custom content to enjoy, so there should be a lot to come back to later.The story and writing is also charming and witty, and the ending is really rather heart warming. More games need to take a leaf out of Octodad's book, story wise."

Extra Dry"". It's chock full of charm and humour, but where the game really shines is the co-op. Two players control 2 limbs each and have to work together. For maximum entertainment, use ""Roulette Mode"", which randomly changes who controls which limbs everytime an objective is compeleted. Some of the best indie has to offer right now!"

And not just because, well, you know, the whole octopus masquerading as a human thing.If you're looking for something innovative that will blow your mind, Octodad isn't the game for you, but if you're just looking for something small and relaxing to play, you should try it out. The game plays like QWOP meets the SPORE Galactic Adventures expansion pack. The game feels kinda fetch quest-y, but that's not necessarily a bad thing as it didn't get tiring for me.The main gimmick of Octodad is your inability to use your limbs like a normal human being, therefore, the controls are kinda wonky. As someone who's played the original student project Octodad, I didn't have too much problems with the controls, but to new players, the rhythm of the controls might be hard to grasp.Octodad's biggest strength is its story. It's simple, quirky, and will warm your heart... or weird you out, take your pick. Because of this, the game feels more like an interactive movie than a full-blown video game, which, again, isn't a bad thing. Considering a movie ticket is about ten bucks or so for matinee, on sale, and the story mode will take about two to three hours to finish Octodad's not a terrible deal. It's a very light game with a lighthearted story that'll make you feel happy."

It make for some very hilarious scenes. You can also find hats and glasses you can put on which is very funny. Octodad's wife and kids are very well done too. they are interesting and voiced very well. also it kind of funny when they talk to you as octodad just makes burping noises. yet they understand you.Octodad is a great character and a loving father. who clearly care's for his kids and wife, who don't even know he is a octopus. which is touching yet sad that he has to hide who he really is from his very own family and has to survive attack from a mad chief who is the only on who know's who he is.the beginning levels are very fun and goofy. then later on in game it introduces some stealth mission's which are fun but can bit frustrating. I spend a good amount of time trying to get a box over me, so I can get past a person. Very annoy.but in the end the game felt a bit short granted it is only a $15 dolor game. but being around 2 to 3 hours long depending on how you play the game, if you want to get all the ties and stuff or play around on the levels. also I was getting very good at controlling octodad when the game just come's to a end so soon. and you end up wishing for more of the interesting and funny life octodad lives.Octodad dadliest catch while being short but a very fun and hilarious game. it is wroth your time and money.

Controling tenticles mixed with physics is what changes what would probably be an average game into a crazy, fun and frusterating experience.If Superman can disguise himself with a pair of glasses, surely an octopus can so the same with a suit and tie.The game will have you laughing as you accedentally perform ""Nothing to see HERE, just go on doing what you're doing"" situatons.You have to accept minor bugs and clipping with a game like this, it just comes with the format.  But the developers are working hard to fix what they can. (May I suggest better camera control)The game is WELL worth the price tag of $15. The worshop user created levels add extra value as well. BUY THIS GAME.It's a lot of fun and the developers deserve every cent they can make off it!"

I played a bit with it on a PS4 controler in store, but trying it again with a mouse, the movement was a lot harder. I ended up having to clear my desk off to complete part of the escalator section. Overall, however I thought the mechanic, although a bit agrivating at times, presented a nice challenge, and it was a fun quick game to play."

I don't care if you're living the game as a octopus masquerading as a human with a family in the suburbs, you need to figure this out STAT!Start with a waterproof keyboard and mouse. From there, kickstart a campaign to build waterproof controllers (you really want to experience all the control options available, don't you?).

The odd funny image of an octopus wearing a suit with a family caught my attention. What is this game about? You're just a normal octopus wanting to live the American dream. Having a lovely wife and kids, mowing the lawn, picking up groceries, taking your family to the aquarium, etc. The only problem is that these tasks are incredibly difficult for you to complete (you know, since you're an octopus) so much so that even walking is a challenge. You use your mouse to move the octopus as well as move his hands (press space bar to switch between hands and feet). At first I couldn't help but to laugh at the terrible controls, but that's exactly what makes the game fun. Do note that controlling octodad gets increasingly easier as you play. Reading the reviews from other people on here, the main two negative points I have noticed: *The game is difficult at parts and *There is not enough game for the price.The game is difficult at parts: Yes the game is difficult in the later missions (particularly the very last mission will have you frustrated). However this doesn't take away from the game at all in my opinion. The sneaking parts as some people had problems with were incredibly easy to get past with little to know thinking. Unless you're a 9 year old who has never before played a video game, you won't have a problem with this.There is not enough game for the price: The main game is pretty short yes. I beat the main story in roughly 2-1/2 hours. HOWEVER, each level has 3 hidden ties scattered throughout. You can change your tie once you find a new one. After you beat the game you also unlock freeplay mode which allows you to go back and do any level. Let me just say that this game is FUN and I will definitely come back and play it a few times a week. I bought the game for $11.99 on a steam sale. Would I pay $11.99 for it again? Absoultely I would. The game is plain funny. The kind of funny where you just laugh at how silly it is. An octopus struggling to pour a glass of chocolate milk for his (somehow strangely) 100% human daughter...that's just silly! I enjoyed every bit of this game, even the last (insanely difficult mission)."

I've never had to use each mouse button to move a corresponding leg before and it's a unique style of gameplay, but relatively easy to pick up.

The control of Octodad is an area that needs work in a potential sequel, as I found his leg spinning in circles (at extremely inoppurtune times nonetheless) when I was barely moving the mouse. That being said, don't make the controls easy. The difficult control setup adds to the fun, I'm just saying the calibration needs tuning.

,Recommended,224480,9404709,"Posted: 9 March, 2014",all,Neutron John,"Octodad!Octodad is a game that uses a lot of physics for it's gameplay. Usually if a game relies to heavily on physics and if the physics aren't good, it lacks. Octodad however makes something as mundane as mowing the lawn, absolutely hilarious as you watch yourself hilariously try to cut the grass. If your not careful the lawn mower can suck you up and even more hilarity. This game really is fun and well written too! At least I thought, not only was I laughing at the antics that Octodad was up to, it was increasingly funny listening to the dialogue of the family, especially the daughter who is the most comedic and smart of the bunch. Octodad's story is heartfelt and original, even if the story isn't one of the most important aspects, it makes for an entertaining game. The animation style fits right at home with some Pixar's earlier work in their 90's prime. Overall I would reccomend Octodad to anyone who want's to just have fun and play something different for a bit. Some of you might see the $14 price tag, but believe not only does this game have replay value, but with the steam workshop intergration, you are looking at limitless hours of fun for yourself."

76561197980107643,Recommended,224480,9087328,"Posted: 13 February, 2014",all,Flailsnail,"Octodad: Dadliest CatchOctodad: Dadliest Catch is something of a mouthful. It is also something of an absurdity. This is a game that places you in the shoes (literally) of an octopus. An octopus who is desperately trying to pass himself off as a normal human being against all odds. But does the insanity equate to fun, or is it just a temporary distraction? A lasting entertainment or something to be forgotten? Let’s take a look.As the Octodad, your job is to hide your true octopus identity from your wife, your kids, and the rest of the human race. See, they don’t take kindly to aquatic life pretending to be people in this world. They would much rather catch and eat your octopus butt. The way you go about this is to act as normal as possible and go about your everyday activities. Mow the lawn, weed the garden, do some shopping at the local grocery. All of the things a normal human father would do. The catch, of course, is that you have tentacles, and not hands or feet. Tentacles with powerful suction cups attached. As a result every action you take is an exercise in insanity. Chopping firewood ends with you wildly swinging an axe around in hopes of striking wood. Shopping involves taking big loping steps around the grocery store trying not to knock every shelf in the store down around you. It is equal parts entertainment and frustration.Blending in to human society is as easy as not acting suspicious when you can be seen. Every pedestrian, every police officer, even your own family observe your actions. So of course barreling through the grocery store knocking everything over results in suspicion and mistrust. You must manage that suspicion lest your true octopus identity be discovered. Never mind how you have children in the first place without your wife knowing the truth. That’s an issue I don’t intend to go into great detail about. We’ll also ignore, for the sake of suspension of disbelief, the fact that you very clearly have an octopus head and tentacles and there is no way to deny it! Those two things aside, blending in is a relatively simple task; don’t knock over everything in sight, try not to get ink everywhere, and don’t glob on to anyone’s face. Not so hard, right?The graphics and sound are suitably adorable. The humans are all fully voice acted while Octodad communicates via burbles and glug noises. They will likely make you smile despite yourself, and should be applauded for their comic value. Visually it’s simple, with its comic inspired appearance and pleasant suburban setting. Yet it fits incredibly well, somehow. It invokes a remarkable feeling of accomplishment for completing even the most simple of tasks. There is joy in successfully chopping firewood, pleasure in navigating a shopping mall without causing complete destruction, and happiness in making your family unit smile simply by the act of trying to be a human. If that’s not some kind of hidden message the developers intentionally meant for us to realize, then I don’t know what is. Maybe I’m just crazy. In fact, that is a distinct possibility.Whatever the case, the game has a certain kind of joyful appeal in its simplicity. Give it a shot. You might just find something you thoroughly enjoy."

Controls are frustrating... on purpose. Its hard to be a Dad who is an octopus in suit. And interacting and navigating the enviroment with these controls can make for some good slapstick. I was more laughing instead of getting irritated. A very good thing. Despite not being able to speak intelligible English, Octodad is a pretty endearing character who you can tell loves his family and does what he can for them. The game has alot of variety in things to do. Play a series of minigames at an arcade, shop for stuff your family (more fun than you'd think.), and navigating your daughter through a dark area while solving physics puzzles. Only issues I have with the game are some A.I issues, camera issues, and some glitches with its physics engine. Nothing major though. And I was a bit disappointed that there was no tentacle hentai joke (kidding).I highly recommend you to get this very fun, original, and endearing game."

Octodad: Dadliest Catch was created with that purpose in mind. You control an octopus... well, to be more accurate, his limbs. Simply walking around is hillarious by itself, and when you add the challenge of picking up, placing, and throwing items, Octodad becomes a game of puzzle-solving skill as well as just messing around. The game's story is about four hours long, which is the perfect length for this sort of game. Then you've still got ties (the main collectable of the game) and achievements to collect.

The game is funny and charming but the leg controls can and will drive you up the walls (if only they did the same for Octodad)! Tasks like climbing up a ladder or walking across thin ledges are almost impossibe because his legs have little traction. Unlike his arms which won't let go of a grabbed item, his legs WILL slide off of surfaces. If his legs simply didn't move once you let go of the button then it would make the game would be less hair-pullingly frustrating and much more enjoyable. Furthermore, you have little control of the camera which makes it hard to see where you are placing Octodads legs in certain camera angles, more control and a zoom fuction would be nice. IF that were the case i'd give it a 10/10 but as of right now I just can't. I would still recommend this game just be prepared to rage at certain times =/"
,Recommended,224480,9738425,"Posted: 5 April, 2014",all,VaultBoy,"Octodad is an a quirky, funny game. The control scheme for the game is unique where you control each leg separately and control one arm. Each leg is tied to a rocker button (LT, RT) and the arm is tied to the 2 analog sticks (to provide 3 dimensional movement). Most of the game has you fumbling around performing tasks like mowing the lawn, buying grocery, or other relatively mundane daily activities. It's the ridiculousness of these things combined with the destruction in Octodad's wake that makes it very fun. Some of the more story-driven elements that require much more precise movement can be a bit unforgiving and it detracts a little from the fun, but overall it's blast to play."

The silly humor never gets old and is fresh despite the fact a lot of the same gimmicks get throws around a lot,most of time with twists.

Little does your family (and the rest of mankind) know, you are secretly an octopus! Octodad: Dadliest Catch is a sequel to the original Octodad, but sadly i haven't played it. In order to keep his secret, Octodad must complete normal, everyday tasks, such as mowing the lawn, grocery shopping, and surviving a crazed chef determined to expose him and make him into moderately priced sushi rolls. Easy, right? Not really. you must switch between hands mode and legs mode. Legs mode lets you, well, walk! but that's easier said than done. See if you can get the mango soda on the top of the cardboard building at the store on the first try! Hands mode allows you to control Octodad's arms (tentacles really). You can grab something, switch to legs mode and the item will still be in your hand. However, Octodad must always be careful. If he does stuff out of the ordinary, such as knocking his son senseless with a carton of milk, people will become suspicious. if the suspicion levels become too high, Octodad is doomed. This game could possibly make you angry (believe me) you can't help but to come back and help Octodad keep his secret. I can't help but to add Octodad to my list of favorite video game characters. When you feel like it you can play some workshop levels (Windows only i believe). Octodad: Dadliest Catch is a fun, charming game and i don't regret adding it to my library."

If you have not played the first Octodad i recomend downloading it, it will give you a feel for the awkward and unique controls. Octodad was very fun to play and was a 2-3 hour story. There are many things to interact with in the enviroment like suglasses, hats, and everyday items. You could spend an hour on a level just playing with everything there is in that world. The Npcs say things that are ironic and humorous to give the player a good laugh. There are also collectable ties, which are very hard to find, they add more to the gameplay experiance. I spent a total of about 6 hours on the overall game, and another hour and a half or so doing some of the Dev.'s community levels and messing around with things outside the story. The game will feature community levels from what i understand, which will give people a chance to make more challenges for your Octodad experience.

The joke is that the controls are purposely terrible and it's honest to god hilarious, genuinely so, and even more so in multiplayer where 2 or more people try to control the same sprite.The multiplayer balance is a little off, one player controls both legs, a 2nd player only gets a single arm to control, without a 3rd player the other arm hangs uselessly. It's kind of a gyp for player 2 not to mention that the arms don't really have much to do in the game anyway. My experence as player 2 still involved lots of laughing and generally a good time but I found myself often wishing I could be useful instead of randomly throwing stuff around and making it harder for player 1 because I was board.Overall, a great game for couples looking for a good time. Way too short of a story for a single player to get much fun out of  but visually clean and diverse game play keep it good throughout. No real re-play value on it's own but I bet the workshop will add some fun that will get me back in later."

I've been waiting for this game for some months now, and I bought it the first day it came out.Is it perfect?...Nooooo?Oh, don't get me wrong, this game is awesome!Let's get onto the controls, anyone who has played the original student game knows that the controls are very awkward. And in this game they're awkward, too. But the major difference is that the first game was very buggy, and many issues could came up depending on your computer's performance (in my case Octodad would begin to climb towards the sky and then slowly come back to the ground). This is not the case in Dadliest Catch. The controls are still very awkward, but there are no real issues with them. They're smooth. Weird, but smooth.Now let's get to the graphics. They're really fun, too! I adore the cartoony feel the game has. It's no surprise Octodad could get into our society, everyone has bug eyes! They remind me a bit of Garfield cartoons. They're not the highest qualiy, but they're not terrible, either. They're not even close to being bad.And now, the story. Oh, man, I love the story. It has to be my favorite feature of the game. I won't spoil anything for those who haven't bought the game yet, but let's just say it balances humor with a dash of emotion. Throughout the whole game, everything is full of very funny jokes and missions that you have to complete.Then the game will get emotional. I was already expecting some sad moments, but nothing like this, actually! The characters are very well written. Even Octodad has many character-defining moments. And the relationships with him and his wife and children are adorable.The voice acting is also really good, too. And it helps to make the story even better.Well, now that we ran across the good, let's run over the bad.This game is too short.Plain and simple, I'm not going to blame the devs, though. This is their first comercial release, and overall it's really solid, so they get a pass. But still, the game feels too short. Most of the time the only reason the game will be longer for you is because you keep dying or because you try to make every single task longer on your own. Sometimes I also feel that the briefness of the game may affect the story a bit. Sure, I praised the story earlier, but the overall briefness of the game opened new questions about the universe this game takes place in.However, there are still somethings you can do. You can go back to the levels you have beaten and attempt to collect all the ties, or maybe even beat the devs records for finishing the levels. But after that, the game is pretty much done. I don't know if unlocking all the ties or beating the devs' records will unlock anything, though. I haven't done that.Thankfully though, the game is hilarious all the way through, even if the briefness makes it a teensy little bit dissapointing. Besides, the game supports Steam Workshop, so you can expect many crazy mods in the future made by fans (and maybe even Young Horses themselves) to fill up the space.Overall, I give this game a 9 out of 10! Do I recommend it? You bet your tentacles I do!Well, review over, now please excuse me while I go and fangirl all over my new OTP. ;w;"

It keeps the game-play very fresh and unique throughout its entirety. I found the story, although quite short, to be very sweet and lovable. Despite that you can finish this game in approximately 2-3 hours of casually playing, there are many hours worth of activities to be had with this game, through collectibles to find and timings to beat.However, through the humorous controls of the game it is worth noting that the game, like any other, has its flaws. I found using a mouse/keyboard to be particularly challenging to accurately move which caused some collision issues, making my character go through objects and ultimately becoming stuck inside objects. Furthermore, in few scripted scenes my character was caught in some unfortunate locations resulting in a game over. Now these situations are rare and far in-between, so don't expect to share my experiences immediately when you start playing.Additionally if you feel short-sided by the price and quick story, be patient as this game can be modded by other players. You'll be able to experience an endless amount of worlds providing a wide array of challenges.I highly recommend giving this game a try especially when it's on sale, as it provides a unique, fun, and heart-warming experience you won't find anywhere else.8.5/10"

After beating the game in a co-op session with three other friends, I'm looking forward to playing it again. The levels are inventive and full of areas to explore, collectible ties to find and little jokes to get. Characters are simple but well-written in a Saturday-morning kind of style, with some good voice acting well-written dialogue.Playing in co-op is a blast, and really well done too. You can assign different controls to different limbs (we played two PS3 controllers, a PS4 controller, and the keyboard/mouse), and keep them set the entire game or use 'roulette mode', where you switch limbs after every objective. Each player is assigned a color, so you can look at OctoDad, see that his left arm is green (for example), and know that you control his left arm. Lots of screaming at each other, pulling the titular dad in multiple directions, and in general just acting like a crazy drunkard.The game is short, only about 2 or 3 hours long, but there are collectibles to find in the levels and completion times to beat, as well as the option to play through levels that other people have made. Worth every penny for a game that is genuinely creative in many ways."

That said, for the most part I had a reasonably good time playing this game, although I would not recommend buying it at full price.I don't usually criticise games as being ""too short"" as I would rather something be short and sweet than to outstay its welcome. With that said, a lot of the fun aspects of this game were less prominent than I would like and I want more. There was also way too much in the way of stealth sections, by which I mean ""more than none"". These sections were not fun at all and they were all clumped together right at the end of the game, making the game leave an overall bad taste with me even though for the majority of the game I was enjoying myself.tl;dr I recommend this game I guess but only if its a large discount.

Awkward prop manipulation and casual/fun (did I mention awkward?) exploration. Any sort of challenge (outside the intentional flimsyness) is modest enough to not get in the way, but prevelent enough to give the game some welcomed tension (see: the sparse sets of marine biologists, who are simply more prone to suspicion than the average bystander).Then the game suddenly becomes much more about strict platforming/stealth challenges, completely missing the point of why this franchise is so interesting and fun. Outside the very final section, the game still retains plenty of charm, but it never again reaches the level of fun had in the the supermarket or the initial aquarium sections. If the game was solely about stuff like that, this would've been one of my new favorite games. However, it's briefness in it's truly fun and genius level design is what's ultimately it's biggest issue.There's a difference between a game like Journey, which was completely fleshed out and properly paced for as simple of an idea as it was... and a game like Octodad, which is just as long, but still holds a tremendous amount of potential (Hell, they wouldn't have implemented Steam Workshop if it wasn't true).I can't help but feel they have chosen to rely primarily on Steam Workshop to make this game anywhere near fully realized. Which is especially irking after an already very successful community-centric Kickstarter. WE CAN'T DO EVERYTHING GUYS! After 2 and a half years of development from a team well aware of the game's expectations to be a lot more than it's previous tech demo, it's a huge disappointment in at least one respect.But, despite the cynicism, the game is some of the most fun you'll ever have in video games for it's first hour... and all that Workshop content will be ""free"".

All of these things add onto the reason why this game is so pleasant and fun. The story itself isn't terribly great, but most of the dialogue is chuckle-worthy. The music is also charming, with the boss battle music being both epic and funny.However, the game is not without it's faults. The biggest thing is that the game can be beaten in a little over 2 hours at a leisurely pace. This includes some exploring and a few instances of having to restart from checkpoints. It would seem that the replayability of this game lies mostly in finding collectibles and earning the achievements, so if you like that, then the $15 price tag should be worth it. If not, this is would probably only be worth it if one were to pick it up during a Steam Sale.As I mentioned before, the controls are awkward. While they definitely add to the charm of the game, I've only played the game using a controller. I can't imagine the keyboard controls would be any sort of fun (though I'm sure others would disagree), so this might also be something to consider.All in all, I would give this a 4/5, with length being the biggest issue."

However the main story of the game is incredibly short to play through. I've played through it twice and the first time through it took me about 2 and a half hours, and at this point I honestly feel like I am done with it. Other than a few good mods in the Workshop, and maybe trying the co-op mode with a friend, there really isn't a whole lot left that Octodad offers.

There is a story that is both funny and makes sense (in the context of the game of course) and makes jokes beyond ""HAHA look that silly thing happened ona'counta the wacky controls"". Goat Simulator or I Am Bread this is not.You play as Octo-Dad. A regular, normal, everyday, run of the mill, white bread dad. DId I mention he's normal? The game really drives that joke home. You control a single limb at a time, each limb consisting of two tentacles stuck together. The joke of the game which is pretty much the central focus being clumsily moving around trying not to raise suspision while you do normal dad things like pouring milk in your daughters glass, mowing the lawn while avoiding flowers, or sneaking past ravenous sushi chefs hell bent on killing and cooking you.This would wear thin if they did the Goat Simulator thing of making a big map and calling it a sandbox while adding no actual gameplay. Thankfully this game is anything but a sandbox. It's actually quite linear, with clear and varried goals that move you along a fairly funny story about the previously mentioned chef trying to kill you, you getting lost in an aquarium, and trying to make it back to your family. It's no Shakespear but it has a clear story to tell and uses the medium effectivly to do so. The story is advanced by the gameplay, not the other way around. This works very well to keep what would otherwise be a 10 minute game, interesting.It even had a pretty fun multiplayer mode where each player controls a different limb or side of the body. It is actually a lot more fun than it sounds.It's one of those games you need to just play to get. Im sure its super fun to watch others play (it was desgined with this in mind afterall) but nothing compares to actually playing it.One last thing, this game supports touch screens and is a blast to play on windows tablet PCs like the surface pro, I actually feel like you have far better control than with the M&K or a controller. Not alot of games support touch, which is odd considering laptops outnumber desktop PCs like 10 to 1, and most new laptops come with touch screens. Neat little bonus."

Of course I'm talking about QWOP, a game I had a lot of fun practising but never mastering.You control Octodad, the protagonist of the game as he desperately attempts to stumble his way through several zany environments while avoiding suspition. Should his cover be blown it's game over and you get thrown back to the last checkpoint.The gameplay itself is very simple, however as I already said it really feels like it built from the concept of games like QWOP. Even going so far as to reference it at one point. However unlike QWOP the controls are fairly easy to grasp and in turn they give the game a unique charm that really enthralled me as the player. There are even some pretty clever puzzles thrown in there too, nothing too brain racking but clever nonetheless.Something about walking down the aisle whilst avoiding banana peels, pots on pedestals and the temptation to start breakdancing for everybody attending is just so lovely and gives the game a fantastic appeal that will at the very least drive you to beat it. Even if you only do so to experience more of the clever nautical humour.For you completionists out there, there are even hidden collectible ties hidden within each level that will take some real dedication and thinking outside the box to find. This is just a side thing and I personally didn't go for them intentionally, but the ones I did find and manage to reach felt pretty satisfying to collect.Octodad is a very lighthearted and silly game that is suitable for all the family. A must buy for your kids and a must play if you enjoy cartoonish settings reminiscent of shows like Tom & Jerry with a pinch of (kid friendly) James Bond movies added to the mix."

It may not be perfect due to some bugs and glitches and the game is on the shorter side (It would probably take you on your first playthrough about 2 to 3 hours), but the story and the humor are what shine in this game and there are plenty of easter eggs that reference other hit indie games. Be warned, though: The final showdown could be a pain in the you-know-where. Other than that, Octodad: Dadliest Catch is definitely worth the $15 purchase if you don't mind the waacky controls and short length."

A person could easily beat it in one sitting and if you're fast enough you could do it before your laundry is done drying. However, the game is incredibly amazing in many ways. Physics are the first thing that comes to mind because they are simply majestic. You throw a toy robot in a grocery store and it proceeds to knock all the cereal off of the shelf while the toy robot gets dismembered limb by freaking limb....and then you feel bad for breaking a toy robot that you didn't buy. Next comes the emotionally traumatizing storyline that could make the strongest of men break down into a river of tears. Imagine trying to live a normal middle class American life as an octopus while a jerk chef knows that you're an octopus and wants you gone. Not to mention that it is extraordinarily fun to play. BUY THIS GAME! I personally don't think it's worth the money because the game is short like I said.

Here's a list of some pros and cons.Pros: Humor that's light, not like Borderlands shoving memes down your throat. Like references to Surgeon Simulator. It's also very emotional at the end, and it just put a smile on my face. An all-around great game.Cons: Sadly, it's a very short game. It only took me about 4 hours to beat. Also, if you don't have a wireless mouse or controller,  it's extremely hard to work the controls. But, sometimes, the rage makes MYSELF laugh.Over all, it's a very fun game. If you have 15 spare bucks, I highly recommend this game."

,Recommended,224480,9022406,"Posted: 8 February, 2014",all,The_Manbat™,"A short but hilarious ride.The main idea of Octodad is that you're an octopus trying to blend in as a human while doing every day tasks like grilling burgers or mowing the lawn. Most of the humor comes from Octodad himself as you try to do tasks, nd dancing. The game is really funny. Controlling Octodad is fun (if a little annoying at times) and it's satisfying when you finally make your coffee in the morning. The story is OK, it's not a Mass Effect level of story telling but it gets the job done. Graphics are colorful and nice to look at but a little bit simple. The game is kind of easy except for the final level which is one of the most frustrating levels in video game history. The voice acting is excellent, especilly for Octodad. The game is quite short, it took me 2 hours to finish on normal, however I did not go for the collectibles. The game has good replay value with collectibles, achievements, and steam workshop support.Overall I do recommend this game.   7.5/10+Great Humor+Good Graphics+Good Puzzles and Gameplay+Good Voice Acting+Good Replayibility-Short-Frustrating End level-Octodad is sometimes annoying to control"

The idea of someone being a married father of two kids and an octopus sent alarm bells ringing in my literal mind.However I was soon pulled into the havoc I was able to wreak on the area, despite the high level of awkward which was the controls. I’ll take a guess and say the game was designed to have awkward controls, anyway and try to let it slide but it never really got any easier to control Octodad as time passed, and I wasn’t given nearly enough time to get used to it, anyway, as it took me around three hours to complete the whole thing.But, as I said before, it was a lot of fun to destroy everything in sight and attempt to complete the objectives with the handicap I was given.What I really wanted out of the game was the ability to use the co-op with two mice, struggling with Octodad’s various appendages was hilarious enough on my own, and could only have been funnier wrestling his limbs with another player. But, alas, I do not own the means to play that way.All in all, Octodad was fun while it lasted, but that wasn’t nearly long enough, despite the various maps and levels created by the community.The scores are as follows:Graphics: 6/10-	Graphics were okay but not amazing. Nothing really stood out to me.Music: 8/10-	The music fit the game’s atmosphere well and was enjoyable to listen to. There was nothing that made me want to look it up and listen on repeat, however.Cinematics: 6/10-	Again, nothing really noteworthy here. It was decent but not outstanding.Story: 7/10-	I really enjoyed the story except for the kids. I still can’t get my head wrapped around them but I’m going to take a guess and say that Scarlet wasn’t completely honest with her husband and they could’ve made the transition to the past more obvious. But I found it amusing and enjoyable all the same.Content: 5/10-	There wasn’t nearly enough here to satisfy me. I didn’t have the time to get used to the controls and managed to finish it in a couple of hours.Controls: 5/10-	The reason why this isn’t even lower is that I’m assuming the controls are meant to be awkward and difficult. If not, I have some serious concerns.Gameplay: 7/10-	While I wish I could play co-op with my limited technology, I will say again that causing mayhem and destruction made up for a little of the struggle with controls.Playability: 6/10-	Due to it being quick to complete, I’m sure I’ll find myself staggering though it again at some point however there still wasn’t enough content for me to be fully invested.Value: 5/10-	For a game this short, it seems wrong to charge it for £11.99, not counting community content. The price is a little too high for a game of its length.Personal Opinion: 7/10-	It’s still a well-made game with decent graphics and a fun story. I would play it again.Overall score: 6.2/10Would recommend?Not when it’s full price. Buy it when it’s on sale."

So even though the base game is really short, you still have a potentially infinite number of levels to play thanks to the modding community.P.S.

But that was just one of the games many charming quirks.Controlling Octodad is another matter entirely, Each one of his tentacles is controlled seperately which makes walking seem as though he were drunk, stumbling around and trying to grab items with a less than steady hand..er.. tentacle? But all of this leaves room for a lot of hilarity as well as frustration. It might leave you with the urge to flip a table, but eventually and with some patience octodad will flop his way right into your heart."

Major tasks are going to take you multiple, frustrating tries and you will get annoyed, but perseverence is key.The game tells of a dear octopus, just trying to live a normal life with his family while avoiding discovery and capture by the evil chef. The story is sweet and endearing. The tasks are everyday things which a human would find easy, but are monumentally difficult for the extra wobbly Octodad. On top of this is the ridiculous fact that despite his less-than-solid form, the NPCs don't know he's not human.The result is a charming game with great personality, challenging enough to keep you going and of course, ripe with hilarity.The only gripe I have is that the playing time of the main story is so short!

I played the previous demo iteration multiple times, and found myself often feeling a sense of deja vu. Much of this game and its predecesor mirrors my own life, and I instantly felt a deep blue connection with Octodad as I silently watched him go about his day. His pain was my pain; his trials were my trials.The controls using both Mouse and Keyboard, and with a controller were intuitive and natural. So much so I often forgot where my tentacles, err *blub* fingers ended and the controls began.Not only were the gameplay mechanics incredibly realistic, and a wonderful aspiration for any aspiring shrimp, but the story was a tumultuous sea of plot twists and harrowing escapes. I felt flashbacks to many instances in my own life, and I am sure you will feel the same after playing this game.I cannot recommend this game enough. If I had any criticism to make, it would be that the story could be perhaps 2000 leagues longer, and that I could never see the final reveal coming. At least my family could never see it coming.  *Nervous closing blub*"

You movement is crazy and makes even simple walking changeling, and picking up objects and throwing them around is just as difficult. Its insane and funny, you are given so much control over the finesse of your limbs and it just makes every task entertaining.

I think it is something you have to experience (much like its spiritual brothers QWOP, Surgeon Simulator, etc.), yet it goes a little further and I think this does work out as a benefit as much as a flaw.See, my problem with Octodad is that it can be unfair. Yes, it can be challenging and require you to think, but there are moments (particularly towards the end) where the game can sometimes fail to give you a chance or leaves you hanging. I remember on one of the levels I 'died' as soon as a scene changed because it didn't give me a chance to even really think about moving. The 'puzzle' before the final boss is also infuriating.But when Octodad is fun, it is FUN. It can be really, really funny to watch him flail and destroy the environment, but the game is littered with in-jokes, references and spoofs, as well as some collectables and other little things to find.Just... be prepared to throw your controller or tear your hair out."

76561197983662248,Recommended,224480,11233832,"Posted: 14 July, 2014",all,TechieRefugee,"To start: I used to add a header to these reviews, but since it made the reviews too long to submit sometimes, I decided to leave it on my Backloggery.Gameplay: Octodad's main gimmick is the controls, but not in a bad way. You can get used to it pretty quickly, and for those who have played the original freeware Octodad, nothing much has really changed. You control Octodad mainly with the mouse while controlling the camera with WASD. You don't have free range with respect to controlling the camera like you did in the freeware game, but there may be an option that allows you to have full control of the camera somewhere. Nevertheless, the camera angles chosen by the game were plenty good enough for me to do what I had to do.As you'd expect from the ""full version"" of the game, you get to do a lot more within the levels. Some of the jokes like banana peels being infernal hellspawn may be lost on those who haven't played the first game, but they're still a classic slapstick gag. Anyways, the areas within the game encourage some degree of exploration, with the main collectable of the game being ties being hidden throughout most every level. I didn't bother to get all the ties on my first playthrough, but I will do that in the future. There's also a lot more platforming within these levels, although not exactly like the final level from the first game. It's a lot of fun just trying to do simple things like climbing wrong-way escalators and ladders.That's a lot of the emphasis of the game's design: making simple things very difficult, yet still fun to do. It does succeed in that. Now, the game is rather short; I only spent about two hours just playing through the game at my pace. I'd imagine I could've spent another couple of hours hunting around for ties. Steam Workshop is available for this game, although there isn't too terribly large a swathe of levels available. Nevertheless, it is a very welcome addition. As far as the gameplay goes, if you liked the original Octodad, you'll like this game. If you didn't like the original, you won't like this. If you're not sure or haven't played either, get the original and see how you feel about it. I feel like it's the kind of game that can stay fresh with a yearly playthrough or something. 8/10.Story: As far as the actual plot goes, subtracting all the humor, it's not bad. It gives a neat little backstory as to how Octodad came to be and it gives a pretty satisfying ending. Add the humor in, and it sure becomes a story (deadpan). You'll definitely get a lot of laughs out of this game. I'm not gonna spoil any of it, but what I can say is that it's like taking a Hannah-Barbara cartoon and adding in liberal amounts of octopus. So if you like that kind of pacing and presentation, you'll get a kick out of this game. 8/10.Graphics: Yet another thing that fits in with that sorta Hannah-Barbara motif. It's very cartoonish and very nice to look at. All of the areas are very bright and vivid with a great bit of art direction. It's basically the style of the original Octodad kicked up a notch and brought into the current year. Even still, I'd say that this game will still look pretty rad, even in a decade or so. Even the original Octodad still looks pretty good today, and that was a school project. As far as the technical details, I was able to kick it up to 1080p at max settings without any hassle on my GTX 760. It stayed at a very consistent 60FPS, with a couple of lag spots here and there (I'm not really sure why the spots that lagged did so) and ran very cool, topping out with a temperature of 52degC. It looks great and it runs easy on your computer. What more could you want? 5/5.Sound: Octodad has the best voice actor of all time. Everybody else... well, it doesn't need to be too dramatic. We are talking about something along the lines of a Hannah-Barbara cartoon, after all. Anyways, the sound direction for this game is most certainly comedic and can often times be the main contributor to the humor of the situation. It's definitely a game where playing it without sound would take away a lot of the enjoyment. The music is pretty fun as well, with the main theme being a highlight. Again, the music is decidedly absurd, which is only apropos given the scenario. I'd play the game first, and if you end up digging the soundtrack, I'd pick it up. It's good enough to do that for. 5/5.Overall scores are: 8/8/5/5; cumulative score of 8.7/10. While it may have been pretty short, what was there was excellent stuff.

Well, by interesting, I mean if you're not good at them, you'll probably scream :D However, whether you get good at them or not, it's sure to be funny. OctoDad, obviously, is an octopus, and as such flips all over the place in a very amusing manner. Workshop support is fun, and works well, allowing you to play other people's levels. The humor (he writing, I mean) is top-notch, and well executed. Not very long, but still definitely worth the money, especially since you can work on achievements after you finish the game."

The living room television is blaring a violently fast cartoon, all primary colors and product placement, into the wide and waiting eyes of a hunched little boy. The children's bedroom is a mass of desk lamps and paper scraps as a thick-fingered young girl carefully cuts out paper dolls, each inch of clearance given with utmost care. In the kitchen, the mother sits over a newspaper crossword, the evening's final cup of coffee growing cool and thick in a hand-painted kindergarten mug. Talk radio is blaring, filling up the empty room with insipid local news, distant international tumults, arcane sports scores, quarter-hour traffic reports.All this light and sound and activity almost covers the gaping hole in the center of the household. The woman's mug has a partner, still sitting in the draining board, untouched for what feels like years. Two depressions in the living room couch, one steadily filling, marks where the heavier adults would sit, watching their children watch. The boy clutches an action figure in his hands - there is no one there to play the bad guys anymore. The girl squirts glue up the wallpaper, but leaves it, untouched - there is no one there to care about the mess. The woman reaches up to turn down a sudden piece of jazz, but remembers - there is no longer anyone in the household who minds that discordant tune.It may be years before the family acknowledges that crater in the center of their lives. Absurd machismo; a string of bad boyfriends; a slow habit grown one glass of wine a night - each may try, inexpertly, to fill that hole. When they finally speak of it, it may be years later - maybe at another graveside, maybe as some long-remembered birthday passes, maybe suddenly and with no provocation at all. Maybe they will speak of it, but they will never be rid of it. They will always remember the father who loved them, and now the father that  is gone.And several blocks away, your takoyaki arrives. It is cruchy and reasonably priced. You might consider a tip, or a good review online."

For some, the controls may be more difficult, as you are actually controlling an octopus, which is not the most simple task at times, and for that, it would can make the game last longer. The campaign is somewhat short, but there are several player-made maps in the workshop, as well as collectibles to get. I have not tried the multiplayer mode, but I would assume that it is much more difficult as you have to cooperate with someone to control the octopus."

Playing Octodad is kind of like playing QWOP on steroids. However, Octodad has a much better story, a much better soundtrack, and much better graphics than QWOP could ever hope for. Octodad is interesting since it seems to rely on slapstick humor, something you don't see a lot in video games. However, despite all of its silliness, it manages to tell a very heartwarming story. If these sort of things sound appealing to you, I would give Octodad a go.Unfortunately, the game does come with its downsides. First off, it is a very short game. If I were you, I would wait until a sale because I think that $15 for such a short game is not really worth it. However, the biggest problem I encountered was the fact that I originally bought this game so I could play it on my low-end laptop. To be frank, my laptop certainly wasn't meant for gaming, but it did meet all of the minimum requirements for Octodad. It ran smoothly with no lag, but once I reached the Arcade, the controls weren't responsive enough to beat the games there. I contacted the developer about my issues, but my problems remained a mystery. Thus, if you want to buy this game, I would personally recommend that you play this game on a computer that exceeds the minimum requirements (even if just by a little). Otherwise, you could end up stuck in the Arcade like I was. Also, keep in mind that I tried to struggle through the Arcade for about 3.5 hours. That means that in reality, it didn't really take me 8 hours to beat the game, but more like 4.5-5 hours. However, I didn't go and hunt for all of the hidden ties and achievements. If you want to do that, it would certainly add more play time onto this game.Overall, Octodad was a fun, albeit short adventure. Just be careful if you have a low-end computer."

There'll be some people who love the idea of being able to fly around an aquarium as an octopus, rebounding off wall and scenery left and right, and there'll be people who would rather be doing something else.It's a fairly nice game and it actually has a fair balance between this insanity and playing it like a ""normal"" game. The controls aren't exactly precise (well, what the hell did you expect?) to get to grips with, but they're easy to use and adapt to after a while. It also adapts fairly well to how you use it - someone who thrashes around a mouse like a baby does a plastic toy will end up playing the game through completely differently to someone who's more slow with their actions. The graphics are bright and colourful, and while the models aren't the greatest, they aren't really that terrible.The main storyline seems fairly short - you could complete it in a few hours or so if you tried and you could probably manage just shy of two if you don't spend half your time trying to destroy as much as you possibly could.

I finished the game in a little under 2 hours and checking the time trials posted by the devs it appears to be possible to finish in roughly half an hour. I liked the game while it lasted and it gave me a few laughs but I would recommend waiting for a bit of a price drop. It does have workshop content for extra levels and such as well as some collectibles which don't really do anything but it still feels a little pricey for what it was.In conclusion I do recommend giving it a try but I suggest waiting for a sale first unless you're super eager about it."

This game is well worth the cash.I do have to say however, this isn't a game for everyone, people might hate the controls or the sense of humor or both and well that is about the whole game, if you hate one or the other or even both, the game is kinda ruined for you. If you are unsure, look up a LP on youtube and see if it's your cup of tea, just try to minimze your watching as it'll ruin the story for you."

Once you get the controls down the game is pretty easy, although you may find some of the achievements/ collectibles may take a few tries to get.  Overall it is a good game, although somewhat short, and I have seen some creative map/game modes being created in the workshop that could add to the playability of the game after you beat it."

I've laughed harder with this game than any other I've played. There are some tough areas maneuvering though, even with the settings on easy..  There is a Chef who likes to go after Octodad. Trying to find ties will cause you to do some crazy things, like messing up a store, or other place of business. I find it humorous. There are two ""Shorts"" available also. Not sure you if you need to complete the game to access them but after I played the game I saw them.I recommend this to anyone who enjoys being clumsy or silly now and then, watching mishaps happen or trying out weird things to do (as well as a challenge). I don't want to say too much but I still want to give you an idea of what it's about.. The experience is rewarding and there are so many things you can do.. Wear sunglasses, wear a hat, open cabinets and throw things about.. But try not to get noticed or else.. back to last save point.. (never happened to me on easy though and I do not play timed so I can take my time).I, myself, try to climb in anything and everything there is. I frequently accidentally wrap my legs around objects, people and often get things stuck to me (like chairs, ropes, etc). I'm very clumsy with this game..  There are a lot of ties so if you are going for those, look everywhere and some are pretty hard to get to. There's a tie guide online, telling you where they are, but those guides won't get your clumsy legs up there.. That, you will have to do.. hahaI posted some screenshots if you want to have a peek. I hope you enjoy this game as much as I did. Octodad is blup blurbishly hilarious.."

However, there are a couple of things that should be noted before picking up this game-Mouse controls SUCK, and I do not recommend trying it without a 360 controller. The game is really casual, but the controls make it frustrating in some instances. Especially on a level which requires you to scale 2 escalators that are running in the wrong direction. There are mini games in the aquarium that are impossible to beat without cheating (and getting yelled at by the NPCs, and possibly causing you to have to restart). The final level, which takes place in the cafeteria is rage enducing and I really wish I would have waited until I purchased a new Xbox controller before trying this game.-It's extremely short, and there's not a lot of replayability and at it's default price it's not worth it.

The music in the game is wholesome, and does not get old at all.The game does have replay value to it. The 5 times I replayed the story, I was still finding things I never saw in previous play-throughs. New dialogue, new areas in levels, etc.The game did however experience a good share of bugs and glitches. Most of which were very frustrating. Very, very frustrating. You can get OctoDad easily stuck through walls and it is a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥to get him unstuck. Very rarely did I have to restart because of him being stuck. Other times, OctoDad would glitch through the map and fall into the blue abyss. Other times since you are playing with a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ wacky waveable tubeman, you can get tangled and soon find yourself in a mess.Overall, I won't be harsh on the game since it's more of a family-friendly cartoony game that isn't supposed to be taken seriously.

I find it to be a decent game but not something worth spending too much money on.So the basis of this game is that you are an octopus pretending to be human and you have a family of humans who have no idea you are an octopus except for on Chef who is out to kill you and eat you. So you spend the entire game basically doing chores. You dress yourself, make coffee, mow the lawn, pick weeds, cut firewood, go grocery shopping and explore and aquarium with your family. There are some puzzles involved with this game. The are mostly trivial to adults.Graphics: 6 - Graphics are nothing special. There is nothing wrong with the Graphics, there is just nothing that wows you. So they are above averageGameplay: 5 - Gameplay itself is pretty cool at first but after a while it kind of wears off. I mean all you do is move your arms and legs and collect things. You can mess around and destroy things but that wears off just as quickly as Goat Simulator does. The other problem I found with this game is that the Keyboard Controls suck. I plugged in my 360 controller 3/4 in and it was so much easier to control. Problem with the keyboard is that it forces you to switch between modes. You cant operate the arms and legs at the same time. The analogs on the controller are also more effencient than moving the mouse. You need a lot of room to move the mouse. The controls are average.Story: 6 - Story is pretty decent. It is obviously not something you should take realistically but it is kind of entertaining but it is extremely short. I mean you could probably beat the game in 1-2 hours. There are really only 5 levels and they are not too long.Replayability: 4 - There are some other modes you can do after you beat the game but I really do not have any interest in playing them. The game has achievements so you will likley play at least 2 playthroughs to collect them all if you are a collector like me but honestly after that I probably will never touch this game again.Summary: Octodad The Deadliest Catch is a average game. It is a short game and I do not feel it is worth the original price. If you can get this game for $5 or less go for it. It is a good game at that price but $10-$15 pass on it. The game is very limited and the novelty of it wears off quickly."

The biggest mechanic employed is the toughness of the controls. This is balanced by the silly story, characters, little quirks and backstories. The game knows how to have fun, but it doesn't feel like it's having fun at the expense of the player. It has fun with the player. A delightfully fun and frustrating experience. The overall jocularity is never over or underplayed. A good game."

I particularly had issues with the Kelp Exhibit, but I suspect that's my own incompetence (the occasional roundhouse kick was also my own fault, probably) that made it frustrating. If you like the concept of Octodad or have played the original, this is a short, but well-made addition to the universe."

NoIf not, at what price reduction? 50% or better.Why play this game?It's a silly game with funny physics and also to see the human world through the struggles of an octopus.Problems: None worth mentioning. An gamepad controller is recommended though.Story: You don't really play this game for the story. It was pretty cheesy but it drove the game forward.Mechanics: You control the octopus' body with the keyboard and mouse. Controls are a bit clunky but that's probably intentional. Solve puzzles and have fun with the octopus physics.Playtime/replayability: 2-3 hours. Play by yourself through the story or do missions together with a friend (localy co-op) two people both control different parts of the octopus.Why I recommend it: I would suggest you download  the first octodad game for free and decide if you think the octopus physics is funny. Buy this if you want more of octodad!"
