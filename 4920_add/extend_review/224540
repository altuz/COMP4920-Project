But with the launch of this new Ace of Spades came the closing of classic, now Ace fans where forced to either buy this, or never play again.The problem is, this game isn't the same as classic Ace, now you might be saying ""Oh of course it isn't! It's new and improved!"" the thing is, it's really not. The game is poorly optimized where as classic could run on a potatoe, this left out a large chunk of the original playerbase. The game also has a much diferen't weapon balance and it includes classes, it really doesn't feel like the glory that classic was.But now, the amazing Ace of Spades community has started a project, a free game on gamejolt called OpenSpades.Open spades is almost exactly like classic and honestly better! The sad thing is that this free game is what most classic players imagined Battle Builder would be like, where as this game is $15, OpenSpades is comepletely free!"

This game used to be the♥♥♥♥♥♥ I played it before it came to Steam, and it was a simple, yet addicting mix if Team Fortress and Minecraft, and had touches of Battlefield and Roblox. So when it came to Steam, I was understandibly excited. They had greatly improved the gameplay, and had added a plethera of maps, gamemodes, weapons, and 4 classes. The gameplay was tight, the graphics greatly improved, and each class was pretty balanced (Except for the Sniper).And then came the updates. First they added a new DLC, which was 1930's Chicago themed, (No idea why they chose that theme), and for me and many other people, the game would crash instantly when you played it for the next few months. That was the begiining of the end. People could only play the DLC maps if you owned the DLC, and the gamemodes were exclusive to those 2 maps. (People can probably agree with me that City of Chicago would  have been an awesome Zombie map.Then they changed the skin of the commando to look more ""Rambo-y"", which looked awful, then they nerfed the Rocketeer class, and turned it into the ""Engineer"". I actually stopped playing then, 'cause everything that was fun about the Rocketeer (verstile, hit-and-run tactics, great in zombies), and nerfed it. Instead, the Enginner had very low health, a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ jetpack that ran out of fuel almost instantly, weaker weapons, and weaker items. About half the community, said ""♥♥♥♥ this"" and walked away. This just left the new players, and the whiny 12 year olds who spammed sniper. This completly ruined the game. Then as if they hadn't done enough damage, they removed the ability to browse servers, and added a lazer module to the Sniper, so whenever you zoomed in, your position would be revealed to everyone on the map. Then they just went ahead and added the Chicago DLC to the game, so people had essentaily wasted 5 dollars on buying it before-hand. The final straw was when they added the ""Battle Builder"" element. Sounds pretty fun right? No. No it wasn't. The game would lag when ever you tried to put down a larger model, and often the maps were so big that the game would crash. Also nobody played the user-made content. People can't even host their own games.Right now I can unfortunetly not reccomend Ace of Spades to you.  If Jagex (who has a long history of runing games) decides to patch the game, and remove all of these mistakes, then play it again. But right now, the game is broken, the achivements are unattainable, the community is awful, and filled with griefers and hackers, and the gameplay has been completely ruined. So, with great sadness, I say that this game is unplayable currently, and I would not advise buying it."

Hahahahahahahahaha-*gasp*-hahahahhaahaha.Long read ahead, but worth it!As someone who has played Ace of Spades for way too long, let me introduce the history of it to you first:In April 2011, somebody called Ben Aksoy released a pretty decent and free FPS with voxel mechanics called Ace of Spades. This was a game that people mostly played on a randomly-generated map similar to Minecraft's randomly-generated maps (only without the trees, only grass, some rivers and more hills). The default and only gamemode at the time was Capture The Flag. All of these in combination allowed for some fun gameplay that required some strategy. Dig tunnels to capture the enemy's intel, or build a fort to defend your own intel. Every man only had a rifle, spade, grenades and some blocks (unlike most FPSes there were no newby spray-and-pray weapons).As this game rised in popularity, a certain company called Jagex was interested in purchasing Ace of Spades. As Ben needed some money to keep updating his game, he agreed. At first, Jagex kept this a secret as to not interfere with the growing progress of the game, and its community with all of the mods/maps/gamemodes/scripts that they were producing.And so the game kept updating, but since Jagex's buyout of the game the direction of Ace of Spades had taken a different turn from the old trench-warfare, stragetical FPS it was to a more typical, faster-paced, almost Call of Duty like FPS (SMGs and Shotguns were added, sprinting added, etc). Coupled with new maps such as Hallway and Pinpoint which abondoned some of Ace of Spades' most important features (Hallway doesn't allow you to build a tunnel underground, people usually battle in a very narrow hallway just a few blocks wide, and it's quite easy to just spawncamp if you're at the top, Pinpoint does not allow any tunnels at all, and the whole map is at the same height), and Ace of Spades became not much more than a free Call of Duty + Minecraft game.And then without much warning, development on Ace of Spades almost halted. Only 1 new version was made that was a beta and was not approved to be an update to the main version of Ace of Spades. And then Jagex had announced that Ace of Spades was to be scrapped to make way for their version of Ace of Spades, almost a completely new game, pretty much alienating almost all of the current Ace of Spades community at that time. At first Jagex's Ace of Spades had some popularity, but as people realised how much the game just sucked in general (lack of timely updates, bugs and glitches, game-balancing issues, etc), and the fact that the game was made by Jagex itself (Jagex do not really have the best reputation of a game company) led to the downfall of the game. Although there have been a few great updates (Classic CTF update, Map Editor update, KV6 modding update), it still doesn't excuse the lack of timely updates, especially if almost all if not all of them brought along some bad features or some bugs.The new Ace of Spades turned that CoD aspect all the way up to 11, and added some Team Fortress 2 into the mix (while Team Fortress 2 is a very good game by itself, the way it was implemented wasn't). Stuff like Rocket Launchers, Jetpacks, classes were introduced. While some fun could be had in this new game (especially the '30s Gangster game modes, and Classic CTF), it was mostly just a mess. In a typical Ace of Spades match it would not be suprising for you to be accused of ""hacking"" and getting votekicked for it, people griefing away every block that you build, a lot of spawncamping (but which since has been reduced with a new update that added and changed spawn positions) and just a lot of kids who play the game in general.If you really want to buy this game, buy it on a seasonal Steam Sale (Ace of Spades usually, if not always are one of the games that is affected by the sales). Classic CTF (basically what Ace of Spades was before the SMG and Shotgun were added and before the game approached a faster-paced gameplay but with better graphics) and the '30s Gangster game modes (VIP, Territory Control) are really the only modes worth playing, maybe with the occasional normal CTF and Diamond Mine too. You should stay away from playing TDM or Zombies (these are the 2 gamemodes which suck the most, and where most of the kids are at in Ace of Spades).Otherwise if you're not willing to pay, you can try the classic, free version of Ace of Spades atbuildandshoot.com, if you like the same, crappy overplayed maps (Hallway, Pinpoint), spray and pray SMGs, playing with a lot of Brazillians who don't speak a single letter of English and people who need to use aimbots/wallhacks to play well.TL;DR: Both the Jagex's Ace of Spades and the ""classic"", free version of Ace of Spades that can be found at Build & Shoot suck, but suprisingly it's the Jagex version that sucks less, because at least it has some kind of variety in gameplay."

But due to the nature of the engine and the fact that there's no such thing as a Cython developer (not a typo!) with 5 years' experience I seriously doubt they will ever get this game out of its constant state of disrepair.The official streams on Twitch don't happen anymore, the game keeps crashing, the balance needs fixing (I'm talking about how there's no good counter against a Miner, so stop crying about the ""noob snipers"" or ""noobtube"" or asking for an SMG buff), and to be blunt everyone's moved to Block 'n' Load so the forums are just filled with Lincent talking out of his shared speech and excretion orrifice saying the same thing over and over again and thinking that he is even remotely funny.This project has simply not been managed at all ever since Jagex started work on the original AoS (I'm talking around about 0.61, where the updates were starting to slow down horrendously), and it's a miracle they managed to bring some coherence out of what I hear was at release a huge griefing simulator with just about every sense of user content stripped away, user content that was creatable in the original AoS.And they have constantly farted around with the issue of dedicated servers, trying really hard to slightly misunderstand us every step of the way. Even when they released their ""dedicated servers"", it was via a Multiplay panel, which was never what we asked for anyway, and having actually used the admin tools I can tell you right now that they are absolutely pathetic - the only redeeming thing really was that they forgot to remove the IRC bot, which is absolutely vital when adminning AoS 0.x. It's just too damn impractical to ban someone properly - you have to download the log file, look up the Steam ID, add it to the banned Steam IDs list, and then RESTART THE SERVER.That's pretty much what's wrong with it. It's a sad tragedy of what happens when management just outright sucks, and what you end up with is a game that's broken and stays broken and doesn't get updated properly.There's actually some really good ideas in this, but due to the things I stated in the second paragraph, and the fact that if this ever gets any more updates at all it'll be months before that happens, I cannot recommend this game.And due to the fact that AoS 0.75 is generally terrible, I can't recommend that, either. Hell, even the AoS I'm writing this review for has a properly balanced SMG that's actually fun to use.Play Quake instead."

AoSC focused on pvp balancing as opposed to asymmetrical game design, which AoS:BB fails to implement well. Additionally, AoS:BB threw away fan-made maps for a while, and has now added them back in a terribly-done way. AoS:C did maps in a .vxl format, meaning things like .png files could become maps.

,Not Recommended,224540,23326037,"Posted: 1 June, 2016",all,"what are ya, wacky?","This game had a legacy before it was turned into kiddie crap by Jagex, who still list it as ""Indie"" for whatever reason. Ace Of Spades, in its infancy, was a rougher, uglier, and all-around funner game that ran on the already-old VoxLap engine (by Ken Silverman, the same mastermind behind Duke 3D's Build Engine), so simple and resource-light that even a crummy Pentium 4 could play any map at full speed. It was a cult-classic, and a smash hit with many internet communities of all sizes.It was developed mostly by a single hobbyist, one Ben Aksoy, who developed it as freeware and updated it, not to cash in on gimmicks or appeal to unfunny children, but because it was his passion to improve the game wherever possible. There were no classes, only a selection of two– later three– primary weapons, along with a shovel, grenade, and pickaxe to reshape or collapse the world.This isn't a review of that game from 2011, this is a synopsis of what a nightmare it became after it was picked up by a bad publisher. The game was acquired by the extremely reputable Jagex Ltd., a publisher and developer with absolutely no past reputation of taking any popular games and ruining them for fast cash. The result took the planned OpenGL engine for the original game, intended to provide sharper graphics and shading, made it sluggish (It initially didn't even work on most AMD graphics solutions) and added a slapdashed class system with grating, corny voice lines worse than a manchild cartoon reviewer doing impressions on YouTube. The ability to procedurally generate a map was also absent from the ""final"" payware release on Steam, in favor of some amateurish prefab maps.At this point, I purchased the game at full price at launch, naîvely expecting that it would be mostly a rehash of the original with some visuals and polish on top to attract new users. It was quite a while before Jagex finally ""added"" a [worse] version of the original game mode to the product, to compliment the diamond mine mode, and obligatory ""zombie"" mode. The game is not early-access, nor has it ever been, but it has always felt unfinished, even compared to its prerelease forerunner. Version 0.75 felt more like an old PC game from the heyday of CS 1.6 or Quake III. It never got stale between the little updates, maps could be edited, characters and weapons could be skinned, and you could play against new people again and again.This proprietary release has barely improved after more than three years, despite generating revenue, in contrast to the original freeware version by Ben Aksoy. Jagex's three improvements I can testify for are: Fixing the issue where the game was a blank screen on many GPUs, adding a dumbed-down ""Classic"" mode that's still a shell of the former game, and finally adding a way to make maps during the ""Battle Builder"" rebrand, a feature that the 2011 beta ALREADY HAD.The good news is, you, as a consumer, can just ignore this slaughter of intellectual property. Just go search for ""Build & Shoot"", or if GNU is your thing, try ""OpenSpades""."

And then I see what they did to the game, i just couldn't believe it.They ruined the fun tactical gameplay we used to have, and replaced it with this piece of crap. They put in jetpacks and miniguns and made it this generic over the top game, ruining the whole concept of the original. Don't even look at this game, or any game developed by Jagex.EDIT: I would also like to say there are not as many lag issues now as there were at launch, and votekick has been improved. It's sad how they took so long to fix these issues.EDIT 2: They added a 'classic' mode aswell. It is similar to the original beta, but still not as fun. No one plays it, and the amazing maps and large scale battles are not to be found here. It's a nice addition, but is still not worth buying if you were looking for something even remotely similar to what the original offered."

,Not Recommended,224540,22491218,"Posted: 17 April, 2016",all,Freyja,"Do not waste your money. Sometime ago, a game was created by Ben Aksoy (the original creator) based off of World War I that slowly evolved into what is now the old Ace of Spades. The game at the time was free to play, and although it had its quirks -- built on the voxel engine, occassional hackers, and so on -- it was routinely updated, simplistic, and took the FPS genre on a new, exciting, and unexplored path.For a game of its stature at the time, it was quite entertaining and many of these quirks could be forgiven. Players were able to build structures, destroy structures, and the game struck a unique balance that was perfectly calibrated between the two. Fortifications, trenches, castles and towers -- the original Ace of Spades had it all, and beautifully made landscapes slowly turned into grotesque warzones of battered walls, crumbling buildings, gunfire, and holes from grenades.Vast networks of tunnels made sure you were always on edge; never sure where the enemy would come up, yet constantly haunted by the sound of their digging beneath your feet. War in the old Ace of Spades was raged across towers and peaks, on the ground in trenches and fortifications, and the crowded blown-out tunnels that fed one's claustrophobia.There was much work to be done about this game, graphically it was very basic. Gameplay, it was painlessly simple, and it had a direction that it was going, but it didn't lie to you about what kind of game it was. Then Jagex, the makers of Rune Scape, had bought the game from Aksoy. At first, many people within the community watched to see if Jagex would take the game and continue developing it further, exploring this unique and unwandered path of the genre. Up until this point, Aksoy had worked on the game alone; the possibilities of what a team of developers could do with such a game had many excited, and some nervous.The result of what you have here, is the biggest joke a gaming company has ever committed alongside the likes of the E.T. fiasco that has long faded from memory. Rumours surfaced that Jagex had constricted Aksoy to NDAs, especially after he tried to get the game back. (Pay in mind, unconfirmed rumours) The company then went back on promises it made to the Ace of Spades community, migrated it to a new engine, and took the game away from its potential. They built it around classes, changed things, and made it feel more familiar (though they couldn't even do this right) to the arcade FPS genre styles we've seen in places like Team Fortress. The game quickly became sniper-haven, and the community who had enjoyed the old Aos was outraged.Jagex's Ace of Spades died out within a year, with the servers becoming vacant and the game no longer interesting. It became nothing more than a rotting, putrified carcass horribly butchered by Jagex's developers; and then left out in the open without so much as a courtesy to bury the poor thing. Ace of Spades died with Jagex, and what was an amazing potential for a game to explore was cut short by a parasitic company. Aksoy has subsequently disappeared, his social media accounts, website -- all of it has been taken down.I played the original Ace of Spades not long after it was first created. And I was one of the hopefuls that were excited when Jagex purchased the game, and I had to fight for a refund from Steam in a process that took about a month thereafter. Many did the same, and Jagex received tons of refunds. The game turned into such a cookie-cutter disappointment, that I've now eternally labelled Jagex as nothing more than a failed, parasitic company with no ounce of creativity. I've resigned myself to never purchasing a Jagex game in the future, and as we've seen with Rune Scape, and now the recent rumours of them being bought out, they're nothing more than a failed company.What Jagex has brought to light, however, is a growing problem among the gaming market over overbearing companies -- such as Jagex -- that have eyed indie-games like parasites. Companies that see these indev games as being quick money makers; who prey on these starting out or independent developers to fix their financial, marketing, or creative woes because of their poor management and inability to run a gaming company effectively. Jagex has gone down the road of other publishers such as Electronic Arts and Ubisoft, that have become nothing more than jokes to be laughed at, and companies to be gazed at with suspicion for their tendency to screw over the markets.And this isn't the only problem the gaming market is facing by these companies. People look at Early Access sales with more apprehension, because of developers that have been successful at wooing the community, raking in cash, and then abandoning the projects (Star Citizen has been pulling people's legs for years now). We've seen companies release games that are nothing more than hollow husks, and all of the actual content is in DLCs priced almost as much as the original game. (Elite Dangerous, Civilisation, Age of Mythology)We've seen parasitic companies, who have no other intention but to bleed consumers dry and destroy a game as much as possible. (Electronic Arts, Ubisoft, Microsoft, and Jagex) This has, unfortunately, made people more hesitant towards those developers that are actually trying to produce not only quality but original content, and are just trying to break into the market without having to worry about the market titans breathing down their neck. We've seen this now with both Electronic Arts and Ubisoft attempting to drag people away from Steam's platform with Uplay and Origin, because they want to monopolise on the market. So, if you want to ask what is killing the gaming market, and what murdered Ace of Spades -- you may settle your eyes on the grotesque vultures such as Jagex.What is left of the old Ace of Spades community has recreated the original game. You can play the original voxel-based version now called Build and Shoot, or you can search for the graphically upgraded version called OpenSpades. Both are free and access the same servers. It's unfortunate that what Ace of Spades was meant to be will never come to fruition, and these two community based versions will never be further developed, but they are still very fun to play and still have populated servers.I understand this review has come out more as a rant, especially against these companies, but it is especially frustrating to see this happen. The best thing that could ever happen to the gaming market is if some of these cancerous companies went bankrupt, that's about all they're worth. However, such a possibility doesn't seem likely, and instead we'll be forever graced by their disappointments."

I remember for a long time being in constant fear when ever I hopped on a server of randomly falling over dead because of stealthy marksman, or having the ground fall out from under my feet so that I can land on a bomb in case the fall wasn't enough to take me out. There was even a chance that if someone sat still too long, a Miner would sneak up on you and smite you where you stood. The rocketeer (engineer for the new players) was hated for his ability to quickly get ouf out of a slippery situation. There were some unique game modes that each provided a new experience every time you played. The game was balanced. The game was hard. The game was fun.But of course it didn't last.It all started back in late spring, with what I refer to as ""The Great NERF."" Jagex published the game, and when they took over development they did what they normally do: listen to the complaints of the people who die because they can't figure out how to play properly. The game lost its balance when the sniper had a beam attached to it. No more suspense about ""where are the Marksmen hiding?"" Then, miner's weapons were decreased in power so that someone sitting around doing nothing would have a chance to fight back when he's attacked. The rocketeer was changed to the engineer and had his jetpack and glide pack removed from the game entirely. No more escapes. now that class is useless with nothing but the weak SMG to fight with. Then, last but not least: They buffed the commando. The commando class was originally no better or worse than anyone else. He could either hold the rocket launcher or the minigun. The minigun, while a powerful and reliable weapon, formerly took forever to charge. Now, not only does the minigun charge faster, the commando can carry it and a rocket launcher at the same time!Everything that made the game fun and challenging was removed. The balanced characters all shifted in favor of the Commando.But it doesn't end there!After The Great Nerf, there was yet one more infuriating change: The St. Valentine's Day Massacre DLC. Back when I bought the game, it was listed as DLC. Several of my friends bought it and I felt like I was being left out on soemthing important based off of what they told me. Then, not too long ago, it was patched into everyone's game! There was nothing offered to the people who had already purchased the DLC. I was excited to play it, but it didn't matter because there weren't enough fans left who were brave enough to try out the more challenging game modes.Unless you are a 12-year-old, don't buy it"

I've never felt the need to write a review for a game before, but I'll make an exception here. When I bought this game it was SO fun. My favorite character had an awesome plane wing jetpack that you could use to fly horizontally, all over the map. It was amazing! I was more than a little irritated when my lovely plane wing jetpack was removed from the game. Really? I bought 3 copies of this so I could play with my family and then they REMOVED my favorite content. Normally I expect a game to add content that I love, not take it away.But wait, you see the awesome plane wing jetpack ALL OVER the trailer right? The only thing is that you can only use it in build mode, not in-game anymore. VERY MISLEADING. It borders on advertising fraud in my opinion. To add insult to injury the original trailer featured the rocketeer with plane wing jetpack in the trailer as well. The plane wing jetpack was revealed and the trailer started playing badass music, showing the rocketeer flying across the map. It was easily the most exciting part of the trailer.THEY ALSO REMOVED VOICE CHAT!!! You used to be able to talk to people in-game and it was great fun. Since effing up the plane wing jetpack they also removed the ability to talk with other people in-game using your mouth. Now you can only type in chat. What fun!!!!In summary, I feel that I bought what was a great game my sister and I loved, and was left with a poo version. Its almost as if Jagex took a hot steaming dump on my chest. The community used to have some people my age, but now it's just kids. Matches are less exciting and slower without the plane wing jetpack flying around and the only content it seems that was added is paid dlc. Really? I have to pay for more content but you can just take away content I paid for? Serious BS. This game isn't fun anymore in my opinion. If I had known the direction they would take this game in, I never would have bought it.AVOID THIS GAME AT ALL COSTS. JAGEX DOESN'T DESERVE ANY MORE MONEY FOR THIS PIECE OF POO."

Nope.There is a lot of good things about this game. There is a fine level editor, but you are limited to the default ""prebuilded models"". The color picker is also VERY limited, as you can paint with colors not on the color picker, but you can't pick the colors. You might be confused what i mean xD. I mean, there is a paint tool, which can paint with noise (random variations of a color). So that means, that you can paint colors, that isn't on the color picker.But if you see by that, the editor is actually pretty fine.Now to the game mechanics. You can start with different classes, like TF2. Each class has some weapons you need to chose for preference. The sniper is the only i really used, and he is very over powered, if he is in the other side of the map. The enemies can just pull down a castle of stuff, if they use a lot of bombs and breaks stuff. Well, gravity in this game is fine ;).So, when you have played a match in all the gamemodes, and tried all clases, you are pretty much bored... Your only chance of playing the rest of this game is making maps in the level editor. And since there is very few player hosted servers, your maps will be more or less useless.I also need to mention, that there are no tactics at all, you just run around and YOLO all the time. The only tactic could be to take down the enemies base and stuff, since players actually can build while the match is live. And therefor, there is no variation, it's like TF2, but without trades and stuff, so nothing to go for or do while bored. There is also no updates at all... Just the same game over and over, day after day...Now to the community: 8 years old kids... Basically. I have stopped playing this game for various reasons mentioned above, but the community is very boring. I got a friend because i joined one of the 3 online map editor servers hosted by players. He were 10 i think, from GB. So be prepared for a very VERY boring community.So, the conclusion of this game, is that it's a downvote. It's not a special game at all. It was ruined by Jagex, who bought the game from some people who actually managed to get the game on the charts."

These were the main things that were wrong with the game.Then they added the Battle Builder...The Battle Builder is a mode were you can build your own maps. When Battle Builder was realesed there were a bunch more problems. The missing text glitch happened a lot more, parts of the map wouldn't load in battle builder.Shortly after Battle Builder came out they renamed the game to ""Ace of Spades: Battle Builder"" Instead of Ace of Spades, and they increased the price from $10 to $15.An interesting idea gone wrong."

The servers are all but empty and the basic premise of the game is flawed in the fact that the game was advertised to be a build and shoot when in reality there is very little building done at all in any o the servers. he game used to have an additional class that had a jetpack that was atually useable.

Uncharacteristically, I picked it up without any real question and immediatley downloaded it.  The game looked fun, but when I launched it, I found that it could barely run on my laptop, which is surprising for a game that uses small blocks so frequently.  The game was slow and felt unbalanced.  I had a hard time taking the entire experience seriously.  The gameplay is sound (and by that, I mean you're able to walk around the map), but very unbalanced.  A simple minigun is by far more powerful than a sniper rifle at LONG RANGE.  Also, when I wanted to play some gamemodes, my pc literally laughed in my face and sat there frozen for a couple minutes to finally report that it couldn't find a server and had timed out.  Also, the idea of destructable terrain is a pretty big joke in my mind.  I'd find myself watching people getting spawncamped among other things, or trying to build their little fort with such a finite number of blocks.  By the mid point of their building, there would be a nice minigun straight through him.The ""style"" of this game seems to bug me.  As far as the blocks, I feel as though they wanted to do something similar to Minecraft (duh) and I'd guess COD simply because of how poorly everything is thrown together.  It frankly reminds me of a generic shooter at this point.  Anyway, the blocky characters and terrain feel like it was taken too seriously for this game.  They tried to pixelate literally EVERYTHING.  It'd be nice to look down, say, the crosshairs of a sniper rifle and not see small blocks guiding my shot.  Also while I mention snipers, I feel as though they're unbalanced because you can get a perfect headshot and the enemy barely notices.  Also he has almost no range, I mean maybe you can aim down a small bridge or from hill to hill, but this is nothing compared to other snipers.  Especially if you do such little damage after an aimed shot.I'm sure this game was expected to have great potential, but it was an utter dissapointment.  Looking at the concept, the game had a ton of potential, but was terribly executed almost to the point of me forgetting that potential and looking at the crap heap it is.EDIT: Also... why have destructable terrain when you have a class that can litterally fly?"

This is crap. If you want to buy this game, save the $15 dollars and go tobuildandshoot.comto play the original Ace of Spades. It's free, so your saving 15 bucks and you get to play a good game. Think of all the things you can buy with $15 dollars. Like, a different game that is actually good and won't make you want to kill yourself. This game takes the worst elements of multiplayer first person shooters and combines them into one. One of the biggest problems is no spawn pretection. The enemy can just walk up to your spawn and kill you over and over without giving you an chance to fight back. There aren't multiple spawn points or spawn protection so just don't even bother trying to win. The original Ace of Spades had you building giant walls to protect against enemies while they had to dig through it to get to you. This version, however, throws that♥♥♥♥♥♥out the window and gives you a class that has a jetpack to fly over the giant wall you built, making all that time and effort you put into it useless.Don't get this.

The game was known for its simple gameplay, building, mods, and, the most important thing, you could run it in a potato.But the project was sold to jagex. Shortly after they released the payed version of the game 1.0. This version removed all the glamour of the version before, by adding weird classes, premade buildings(that nobody uses by the way) and you could destroy the blocks really easyly...I could spend the rest of the day talking about it. And you couldn't run in your potato anymore!But the old community(just like myself) didn't like all these changes, and created a new website that hosts the old version of the game(0.75 and 0.76) calledbuildandshoot.com. At first it was great! But there was no more development of the game, and most game modes are not played anymore(mainly CTF, which was an hour round trying to protect and capture enemy flag. The tricky part here is that you could build tunnels, walk around the map, destroy enemy defenses, create traps, stealth to the enemy flag and come back in one piece, not to mention the maps were huge) and slowly the community started to die.Now there is no more of what it used to be.The best game I ever played now there is no more of it.How sad."

I only wish this was a better game.All these variables seemed like they were taped together, it seems like the developers put more money in the trailer than the game. The elements of this game are a fantastic match, but rather being wed in a wonderful flurry of passion they are merely going for coffee for the rest of their lives. So much potential, just no effort put into execution, similar to CoD all the developers cared about was money.A counter recommendation I have would be Brick Force, a game where these pieces are put together in a format that is much more streamline that this. It has many elements of pay-to-play, but as a free to play player I have successfully achieved very high ranks against people a much higher level than me"

It's one of thoes ""block shooters"" where you can build stuff from blocks and terrain is fully destructible. Ace of Spades tries to mix things up with class system. Class system is interesting and they all have creative weaponry. There are also lot of very nicely made maps on this game, but thats really all positive things i can say about this game.First of all, my worst problem with the game is the horrendeus spawns, teams usually spawn on certain location and without any spawn protection games tend to turn into full spawn camp mode.As said, the class system is interesting ,but over half of the maps are really huge ones, which means that it's 90% snipers only. Also while the game already feels overpriced, you cant even unlock all classes or weapons without paying for dlc. Ace of Spades gets boring really fast and to top it all off there aren't even that many people playing this game anymore.This game used to be free before jagex bought it, but you can still play the original (buildandshoot) one for free on your browser."

With friends you can mess about and still have an enjoyable experience but it just isnt like it used to be. I realy loved the older versions of the game before too many new weapons and such were added making it unballenced. My review below has not been changed and may be outdated so sorry, just thought it may give some more insite to the game and its history :D~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Ace of spades used to be a brilliant game but has gone a bit downhill. I used to hop on whenever I had some time to spare and play all different types of game modes. But then update after update it got ruined. They added to many weapons and tried to make classes balanced (but just made every gun do less damage) and then they saw it was a problem so they tried to get it back to how it was. It didn’t work, instead pistols one shot, miniguns take about 4 shots to kill(making them very op), machine guns take 2 shots and overall it’s a mess. So over all you should check it out but you may not like it. I would have rated it 9/10 when it was good but now a 3/10 as it is playable but sometimes not fun at all(such as when you get spawn camped by one guy with a pistol)but as i used to like it so much i will recommend this gameIf this review helps please give it a thumbs up"

Jagex shut down it's forums in January, which hints at the possibility that they might be closing the in-game servers forever in the not-too-distant future.And it's a shame. If every single server wasn't hosted by Jagex, and there were at least some free ways of hosting a dedicated server, I would still recommend Ace of Spades, because you could then keep playing without relying on every master server. However, that is not the case. Therefore, buying this game would be a waste of your money.This game has and will always be the most memorable one I have ever played.

I have all of the achievements, so that's enough for me.Problems:The game is already a bit on the shady side, games lag, Jagex is not even the producer, (I think, Jagex just uploaded it for Steam. And bought the game. I also think the original game was free.) there are constant griefers who are on your team, random jerks who votekick you for nothing, and much more. Also, the ping is terrible. I have had a server and EVERYONE had at least above 1999 ping.The Game Alone:This game is still very good, it has a commando class, or as I call him the heavy weapons guy. He has a mini gun, rpg, grenades, and two melee weapons to choose from. Next is the Marksman AKA sniper with a sniper rifle, pistol, and landmines that are OP but no one uses them. So sad. Next is the Engineer. He is a builder equiped with an SMG, turret, or blockgun, and pickaxe. He can choose to build more styles of blocks. Like sniper posts, or bridges. He can hold more blocks then the others, and starts with more blocks too. Lastly is the Miner, he has a shotgun, drillgun, and Tnt. He starts off with no blocks. Those last two classes are pretty cool right? But what happens when no one uses them?More Problems:The only class you see is the sniper who is, dare I say it, Over Powered. I mean, if people used those landmines, he could easily win EVERY GAME! People even use the sniper in the Zombie Mode, and they suck! KEYPOINT, EVERYONE IS A SNIPER! And it's hard to survive, just get a formentioned troll who takes down your spawn base, or destroys your bridges, then have an engineer setting up bases for snipers in the air. Once their job is done, they switch to a sniper. Full servers of nothing but snipers. And worst of all, the game is kind of dead. There are only 5 servers with people in them, only two are half-way full. The others have 2 people.Building: In the build mode, it's actually pretty fun. You have a paintbrush to paint blocks, you can place blocks like you can in battle, and they give you some pretty cool buildings, mountains, and other stuff to use. The only problem I have, is that it crashes every five minutes.The Sad Truth:The sad part is, I have to be a sniper. I'm better with heavy/commando, but it's the only way to survive. And then you have to become who you hate, you destroy bases, you build sniper towers, you spawn kill them all. Because... It's the only way to survive. You get better with the sniper just like these people, it's all you ever use. It's all anyone ever uses. And then you buy a new game. There aren't any engineers or miners... but there are snipers, Oh there are snipers.Conclusion:This game is fun to play with a friend, but you just get killed by the snipers any time you try to talk to each other or do anything. If you play this game, the urge to become a sniper or a jerk will be so bad, it will spread to you, your friends, and everyone you play with. So don't buy this game. Just... don't.EDIT:This is getting long but they recently updated the game, 12/11/2015. Jagex: Two new classes you have to buy with real money. But wait, look at the new weapons, don't look at the rip off classes, look at the new weapons. I haven't tested most of the new stuff, neither will I buy the extra classes. One is a healer with a... shotgun? And the other is some exlposion guy idk. We already have miners Jagex -_-. I hate to say it, but you can only imagine how ruined this game could get."

Jagex clearly noticed that Ace of Spades had been given more attention, and so they made the game Free-To-Play, but they also tried to use this attention to get as much money as possible by adding in a DLC. it was such a shame now that they have DLCs in the game, in order to get new weapons and classes you must pay REAL money, they did the same with Block 'N' Load. having to buy heros ruins the entire game, plus it dosn't add very much anyway! i believe that the DLC ruined the fun in playing Ace of Spades, they remade Ace of Spades, deleted the origonal and added a DLC.YOU HAVE TO PAY $15 FOR 5 GUNS AND TWO CLASSES!Sector 2 of the review: 1/15/2016somehow the new update has made the game even laggier than ever before! even turning the graphics to the lowest of the low settings dosn't do anything, in fact it can also make the game run even slower. before the update i never had lag spikes of any sort, but now i get them all the time that i have to quit and restart constantly. also you can't change the graphics during gameplay like you can in most other games! as well as the fact that you have to restart the game to see changes, which is just stupid. even Team Fortress 2 can change graphics during gameplay and that game was made in 2006!overall i think that this ""Remake"" started off ok since it had no micro-transactions- and then proceeded to be ruined by DLC! i mean, they did the same thing to Block n Load and look at how bad that was, a free to play game where you pay money for crates is ok-ish, but when you have to pay money for heroes in a game WHICH STILL COSTS MONEY is just the wrong thing. ESPECIALLY SINCE THEY SAID THE GAME WAS FREE TO PLAY WITH 1 DLC, BUT IT STILL COSTS MONEY! now that's just silly. i used to like the original and was looking forward to a remake but it runs even worse than the original and trys to grab more money. the only things i like about the game is the soundtrack and the map builder and that's about it.The game is now rendered an unstable piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥ it used to run just fine and i have had 0 instances of the game crashing in any way, only tiny lag spikes that last a second, but in the 1st week (This Week) after i reinstalled it i have had approx 13 crashes, and it isn't my laptop or internet. in fact i set my laptop's highest priority to keeping Ace of Spades in a extremely stable condition, yet it still crashes"

A HUGE factor was the usefulness of planning and base building. It was so worthwhile digging a tunnel to the front lines and trenches to cover your movements. This new version COMPLETELY disregards building incentives. There is NO REASON to build when every class can destroy your base in 5 seconds. Even the quick build options are worthless. The old game had elements of stealth and trench warefare, digging into your surroundings and slowly chipping away at the enemy across the valley. The fog of war really conveyed tension and uncertainty when crossing an open area, especially alone. All in all, the old version was extremely groundbreaking with it's suprisingly deep metagame and it's simple mechanics. Although the ""real"" game has smoother edges, it's fast paced gameplay completely did away with any strategic thinking and building for a run and gun voxel shooter. I'm truly disapointed with the direction the developers took."

This is not an objective review, but I will try to give as many details as possible.Whelp, this was a great game.I used to play that game during its beta and bought it on Steam. It used to be a really dynamic game with decent game modes, a decent balance and interesting features that allowed players to have a good time, until the developers strayed away from the original game. Now it is just a slow-paced, worthless mash up of Team Fortress 1 & Minecraft beta, except those were actually fun to play.The basics of the game: in most game-modes, there are 4 classes:•The Commando, who carries a rocket launcher or a minigun, the balanced guy•The Sniper•The Rocketeer/Engineer, who can use a jetpack and carries a SMG-like gun•The Miner, who carries a shotgun and works on modifying the environment to benefit his teamHere is a quick list of examples explaining how the gameplay changed for the worst over the past 8 months.•Dynamism is gone. The Rocketeer used to be able to fly across the map and actually do stuff. Now his job is to use a ""jetpack"", once every minute give or take, fly up for 2 seconds and wait for snipers to gun him down.•Digging tunnels or just using your ability to change the environment is not worth it anymore. For one, snipers have been given a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ beam that gives away their position when they aim down the sights, making sneaking around just useless. Some would say it's to avoid camping, but there are other solutions that don't imply making one of the 4 usual classes useless, unless they go for close combat.•The specific game modes that do not involve the 4 classes depicted a few lines ago have not evolved a bit and the Zombie one suffered from the nerfs on classes so much it isn't even nearly half as interesting as is used to be.•The community keeps being ignored and slowly decays (hence a series of awful changes to the game). Today, January 26th 2014, across the United States, Europe and Australia, less than 30% of servers overall had any players playing. It took Jagex a single year to destroy a community of 2 million players?To sum up, Ace of Spades is now a shadow of what it used to be, and a half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥map editor will not save this game from its terrible evolution"

But another company bought it so it was put on steam as a paid game rather than a free one. Okay, I can deal with that. Then things started to change. It seemed to constantly update, with each update making the game progressively less fun. But I kept playing anyway. FInally, they added a laser for when you are being aimed at by a sniper, not just a dot, a laser sometimes crossing half the map. Sure, that makes it easier to avoid snipers, but the whole purpose of sniping someon is to not be seen. At that point I gave up on the game. I checked on it a few times afterwards to see if it was fixed later. It wasn't. It amazes me that one company single-handedly turned a fun interesting game into a total piece of crap. The only gamemode that is still somewhat decent is capture the flag on the WWII settings and map.

I've played with some of the people who go competitively, and have maintained touch with a couple of them. That being said, this game, in its current state, is... sort of fun. But don't take it very seriously.This game used to be quite fun in its original version (which I played A LOT) because I liked the largely strategical aspect to it because of the sandboxy-minecraft element, which definitely cut down on the DIE DIE DIE DIE of traditional FPS games (like COD). The game forced you to think and be creative, as well as manage your surroundings in a manner that very few FPS's have been able to do because of their largely static maps. With completely dynamic maps, that changed everything. So for some time I enjoyed myself, sniping people with the regular rifle, cleaning out tunnels with the shotgun, mowing people down with the SMG in Hallway, etc. There were no seriously overpowered weapons at the time. Each one had its role, and gameplay was fairly simple yet very complex at the same time.And then Jagex announced a new version of the game.Originally, I was pretty excited. The new classes looked cool, the maps looked great, and the graphics were given a nice boost. I played and played and played, and generally had fun for the time being. I attached pretty quickly to Marksman, which was fairly overpowered from the start (no method of sights, which was fine). Jagex was very slow to do the updates. None of the original requests for balance were heeded, such as a laser dot (Not a ♥♥♥♥ing beam) like the one they have in tf2, which makes it obvious yet not completely in your face like it currently does. Minigun did a bit too much damage, and the rocket launcher was a little slow, simple little balancing tweaks to make the gameplay more even and smooth.That is not what we got.Instead we got a ♥♥♥♥ing beam for the sniper, which has made the class... well. Difficult to play. It requires a series finesse for quickness that most people simply do not have, and really it ruins the game because people just spam it all the time. The rocket jumper was taken directly from Tf2 and not executed properly at all. The commando was reskined to look like Rambo... Why??? The rocketeer was nerfed and replaced with a stupid class called engineer, which removed the amazingly effective snowblower and gave it to engineer exclusively... who then became a fairly worthless class at actually fighting. This did not balance the game at all!Then came the stupid battle builder. Useless!!! Whenever you tried to place one of the larger pre-made blocks the game just lagged incredibly. It was not even worth your time to create detailed maps. They got rid of (temporarily) the server browser, and replaced it with some stupid auto-join thing that nobody liked. Battle builder maps were not popular and were never really widespread (outside of games with friends).Don't buy this game. DON'T BUY BLOCK AND LOAD EITHER!!!"

Neither of these are true, with it being even easier to hack than the classic version (which you can still play atbuildandshoot.com), with the initial version still having a debug console that let you run arbitrary Python code (the language the game is written in).Also, while listed as an indie game, it is far from it.

Back then, the graphics weren't amazing, but the maps were great and the gamemods were fun to play and compelling. There weren't any classes, only three guns you could choose from: the rifle, the SMG, and the shotgun. Back then, it was a fun game that I would recommend to all of my friends, and I considered it to be as great as games of the same genre such as TF2.Now, I can't say that anymore. Instead of having a choice between three guns, which was simple and balanced, now there's four different classes you can choose from, and one class that is practically designer for griefers: the miner. The miner is equipped with dynamite, drill guns, shovels that dig out huge portions of blocks, and can destroy a spawn in a matter of minutes, ruining the match for everyone. Of course, the community and its players are the ones who do this, but it's Jagex that made the class practically designed for the destruction of a spawn.While the feature of being able to destroy and create blocks to turn the tide of battle is cool, when paired up with all the happenings of this game, it just becomes boring and rage-inducing. Honestly, Jagex should have just updated the graphics of the origianl AoS, and then the world would've been a happy place. When they ""renovated"" the game, they got rid of amazing game modes such as Arena and a free for all mode. And they even got rid of some of the best maps such as Hallway.Also, the classes are way too OP, and very unbalanced, unlike all nine classes in TF2. TF2 has nine classes, five more than AoS, and yet they were able to balance each and every class' weapons so that the game at least feels fair. In this case, that was never considered. The sniper can fire multiple shots without reloading, unlike the sniper in TF2 which can only take one shot then must duck for cover as he reloads. Also, sniping just feels easier in this game for some reason. I don't know why, but there isn't much challenge to it. Anyway, the Engineer has the ability to fly at the cost of fuel, but also has a SMG. So, he can easily come done from the sky and rain death upon many people quickly. And the miner, as I've already explained, is just a griefer that came from the depths of Hell.The commando I personally haven't had any trouble with. Anyway, this game would have been much better if it was just an update with better graphics. If they want to make money on the game, that's fine by me, I would pay for it. But it's not a good game. Do not give Jagex a single penny, as this game just sucks, as I give it a score of 2/10. Not even one dollar would be fair to pay for this game, and Jagex should rethink their entire AoS situation. Thank you for reading my review."

Sure, this game is a Minecraft, TF2-inspired FPS combat that feels relatively new in a genre that is completely overrated...it's fast-paced combat certainly sets it away from a crowded FPS genre, and its Zombie mode is surprisingly the best mode in terms of balance and fun.  Another positive is that it offers map editing and the ability to share custom maps.Sadly, each of Ace of Spades' four classes certainly have their pros and cons, which significantly imbalance the game depending on gamemode.  For example, the Rocketeer jetpacks across the map with an SMG in Capture the Flag which seems unforgivably lopsided.  Furthermore, the 'Minecraft' building aspect seems untouched and is hardly used which is also hampered by a bugged reticule..."

If they reverted back to the old days, this game would have sold about 10x as much.

I waited a bit till the thanksgiving sale, and bought it cuz why not?I tried playing a couple rounds, and honestly everything had the worst aesthetics I have ever used. All of the animations were broken and all of these ugly colors popping out from nowhere.The shooting is completely intangible, there's no blastback or even good sound effects. The animation is perhaps a 20 degree rotation and maybe a pixel hand popping out from somewhere.And BEING shooted? I have played many first person shooters, and in all of them, the developers actually wanted you to realize your organs are being teared out. Either the weapons are way to OP, (if you are complaining that I was just getting snipered, then that proves my point), or Jagex simply cannot create a good way to alert you that you're being shot at besides a few moments of red lines before you're dead. And spotting enemy characters are impossible when the hues of their overalls match the surrounding lighting and scenery.Jagex makes running speed slow as hell to allow people to ""innovate"" and make trenches. But if you're gonna call this excuse for a game a first person shooter, you've gotta have fast movement and a good gun experience if you're gonna decide you're gonna have classes and snipers with OP guns. The engineers are completely ignored, because where are you gonna find them if theres a staggered respawn rate, or any respawn at all. The video I watched shows each class working together as a team, instead of a bunch of snipers running around on a map that takes 15 minutes to walk across.There are tons of players whose overall goal is to shoot each other, instead of building cool things and strategize to win.Overall, this is a terribly designed game which needs lots and lots of work. The concepts they are enforcing is impossible when you have no boundaries, and then the boundaries you DO have is the experience of playing the game. To me, playing this game makes me feel like I'm doing work, not having fun. Screw you, Jagex."

The main features in a nutshell is that the terrain is destructable and you can build bunkers and bases or sniper towers and so forth. The game is very fun, especially when you get good at it and change a few of the controls but it does have some problems like that some maps have the issue of one side clearly having the upper hand and that there will almost always be a camper on a server. There are no classes that are over-powered or unbalanced and you have to train with them for them to be any good on the battlefield.It is practically a multiplayer-only game but servers are far from empty and there are a lot of game modes to try out and you can create your own maps. The Steam workshop for this is very basic but still good and fun to try out fans' maps. As every game has, the game suffers from bugs but the game-breaking ones have been removed. Graphics can be altered as well for better frame rates.Overall, this game is a must buy if you want a FPS with a interesting twist and I give it a 7.5/10."

I'll start with the bad stuff first:One of the big problems I find with game is ""Custom Game"", in which the player hosts a lobby and decides the game rules. It sounds great, but doesn't quite live up to expection. Not nearly enough people go on custom games, so unless you invite your friends, you'd be lucky to get 5 people in your lobby. Another problem is the instant kick for the starter of the lobby to use in-game. Basically, if the lobby starter says you are ""hacking"", instead of pressing the ""Kick"" button to initate a votekick, you are automatically kicked from the lobby. It can be helpful, but most of the time, if somebody is being annoying in-game, the other players will start a votekick before the lobby starter does.There are other cons too. Map making is interesting, but depending on what kind of pack you pick, it limits the building, terrain, and other things you can put in your map. Also, classes do not have nearly enough choices of guns. Actually, there are only 4 classes, and only 2 of them can choose between 2 guns for their main weapon.Now for the good things:The Steam Greenlight system for sharing maps has helped custom games immensly, since a custom game is the only place you can actually use these maps. Map making, while I previously said was limited, is still quite fun. The fact that you can open it up to the public or friends for them to help work on the maps usually results in fantastic maps, and adds more fun to map making.The regular servers are also quite fun. There are tons of different gamemodes, and the majority of them are a great deal of fun. My personal favorites are Team Deathmatch, Classic Capture The Flag, VIP, and Zombies. The maps made by the developers for these servers are quite good, and have incredible impact the way you play against your opponants. Also, the move to make the original ""St. Valentine's Massacre"" DLC part of the game and for free was very smart, as it added a new class, 2 new maps, and 2 new gamemodes (one of which is the awesome VIP).All in all, I'd say Jagex has improved the game since they first took control of it. I hope that future updates will fix all the cons and add more reasons to buy this game. 8.75/10."

The addition of classes was a terrible idea designed to draw people expecting this to be a Minecraft COD. The addition of rockets, and the bizarre choice to make killed players blow up their surroundings, trivializes what makes AoS AoS: the ability to construct your own structures. Why build a bridge, bunker, tower, or trench when it can be effortlessly blown up by someone across the map?Am I being blinded by nostalgia? Afraid of change? I don't think so.

Almost every server is laggy and unplayable. The hit detection barely works, so an enemy in the middle of your crosshairs will not get hit while you are killed with an SMG from across the map. The store page claims that there are seven different classes when there are only 4 in the game. The building is barely functional and very difficult to use. You won't be doing too much building, though, as the Rocketeer class can use his jetpack to bypass any defenses you have. Actually, all of the classes are terribly balanced. Very rarely are you killed and feel like your killer deserved it. The animations are laughable, and the fact that the game tries so hard to make everything blocky makes it look terrible. Minecraft's visuals have a charm to them. They are simple. The models in this game look awful and complicated, as if the developers couldn't decide between having the game look nice or looking blocky. When you join a game, it asks which team you want to join, although you will always be moved to the team with less players. What's the point of giving a choice if it is undone? Another weird part of the game is that the class selection screen includes multiple weapons and gadgets that you can use. There are at most two options in each category, although there are many empty boxes for each class, as if they were planning on adding weapon variety to the game.To sum up, Ace of Spades is a badly made game that is going through an identity crisis, not sure whether it is a sandbox building game or a terribly balanced class-based shooter. 3/10"

This leads to an interesting style of combat that rewards people for their skill and ingenuity in crafting the landscape and building structures to their tactical advantage.I have spent nearly 300 hours playing this game and the main thing that keeps me playing is the fun factor.  There are always people online obviously not as many as with some fps games but you can always get a match by using the server browser. The gameplay itself is also a main factor in its durability. As the environment is buildable you can create buildings and mould the landscape into something that allows you to outwit your opponents.With it being in the steam workshop you can download user –created maps for use which adds endless variety.While the graphics may not be for everyone, people that have played games such as Minecraft or more indie style games probably won’t mind.  I guess a bonus of this is that it runs smoothly . I only experience the odd, very occasional bit of lag.Pro’s:-	Great for lovers of first person shooters.-	 Multiple classes to use to your advantage.-	Tactical gameplay.-	Plenty of games available and a good range of maps that come as standard.-	Custom Maps.-	Range of game modes spanning from Team Deathmatch to Capture the Flag and ‘Zombie’.Con’s:-	Lots of trolls and people that try and kick you for hacking if you are much better than them.-	Small infrequent DLC.-	No skill tree/ weapon advancement.-	A few bugs which aren’t too big a deal.-	Not a large emphasis on teamwork.I don’t usually put this many hours into a game so with that in mind (and its low price tag) I’d definitely recommend Ace of Spades!    8.5/10"

I distinctly remember teams fighting for control, 3 evenly matched classes that could all kill each other. Trenches were built and cover was extremely important. Teamwork was needed.No longer is this true. When it was taken by Jagex, it was ruined. Large maps prevent anything other than running randomly around. A jetpack makes any attempt at building a fort useless. A snowball machine doesn't even have a correct name, just a line of code. Really? Did they release it too early on accident?Essentially, Jagex took this game and made it more similar to other first-person shooters, and leeched out the unique concept that it was. I wouldn't be upset with this game if it wasn't great before.Go toBuildandShoot.comif you want a better experience. It is the old version of the game.Edit: I only have 10 minutes in this game because when I bought the game, I only had access to my ""movie"" laptop, which was not designed for much beyond blu-ray movies. The game did not work on that computer, even at the lowest settings (Although strangely, the old free version worked perfectly.)The experience I have had with the ""full"" new game was on my friend's account, taking turns as we died, until I became frustrated enough to go back to my poor laptop to play the free, original, and true version of Ace of Spades."

The idea of these different classes may sound good on paper, but when executed, especially how jagex exectued it, the gameplay is completely unbalanced. This game advertises itself by saying it has ""customization on a new level,"" ""build and destroy your world,"" ""tons of exciting game modes,"" and such. Customization on a new level is incredibly vague so i dont even have to say anything in that. Build and destroy your world may sound fun, but why build a fort when you can just fly over it, why go straight into battle when you can dig under everything, why snipe when a miner is just going to go under everything, and much more. Most of the game modes aren't even that great either. Everyone knows what CTF is. The problem with this game mode is that if you can get 2 or 3 people to just jetpack over to their flag or dig under to their flag you can just easily bypass the whole enemy line. Demolition seems pretty interesting but all you're really going to see are miners and snipers along with griefers destroying your own base instead of the enemy's. Diamond mine seemed pretty intresting, racing to get the most loot but again all you're going to see are greifers and miners. Multi hill is basically mine under to every hill or jetpack there, and occupation is filled with miners and jetpacks on the attack and commandos with snipers on the defence. TDM is the only thing that really is balanced, save for the miner since that classes usefullness does not apply at all here. Zombie is filled with big tunnels or towers made by miners and jetpacks, territory is basically multi hill, and vip is just a sniper fest. So all in all:-Original-VERY unbalanced-Community made maps-Advertised points of the game is its downfall-DLC-MANY MANY griefers-Can get repetitiveWhich equate to 3/10 DO NOT BUYI highly suggest checking out this free game called Build and Shoot which was the original Ace of Spades before Jagex bought the name and made the game what you see now. I absolutely adore Build and Shoot because its so simple; theres not miner, no sniper, no jetpack, just a rifleman and SMG man with shovels. The only major problems are that this also has the dig under everything and capture the points problem, hackers, and griefers but really is a direct upgrade from Ace of Spades and is completely free. God damn it jagex all you really needed to do was slap a pricetag on Build and Shoot. 9/10 for Build and Shoot btw."

The 8-bit style graphics with a Call of Duty multiplayer base seemed exciting, and it is, for maybe the first few matches then it gets boring. Ace of Spades lacks modes and classes which would make this game much better. Hopefully more content is slated for the game, but as it stands it feels very bare bones.You can pick up to 4 classes which are heavy machine gunner, sniper, assault, and engineer. These are cliché FPS classes and the game really needs more or at least a way to make your own classes. There is no customization to speak of, which is really boring, but what is here is fun for a while. There are a few modes such as Team Deathmatch, Diamond Mine, and Zombies to name a few. I love Team Deathmatch so I went in here first. Playing with up to 24 other players was really fun, I dived in as a machine gunner and started fragging the other team. I soon realized that the spade comes in handy to dig your own fox holes or holes in walls for your sniper rifle. The environment is ever-changing and this is something that can make online fagging really unique and fun. You may run across a building then 5 minutes later it is completely destroyed forcing you to change tactics. I soon realized that you aren’t given a fair enough amount of ammo to start with and ammo drops are very scarce. The sniper rifle has 4 round clips and the reload time is really long, so there are some balancing issues.I started to see the issues during my first match of Zombies. Players can climb on top of the level (on the edges) and just kill everyone down below. You have to take your blocks and make a floating path up to stop them. I also found you can get lost forever if you start digging in a wall of a level. I spent 4 minutes trying to dig my way out. That isn’t fun at all. This game needs barriers and limits on things to make it a more balanced FPS game.Once you play around with the four classes and stick with one you will venture off into other modes like Multi-Hill or Demolition. These modes are fun for a while, but after maybe 6-8 hours online you will get pretty bored. The game just feels very stiff and uneventful. There are no rewards for killing anyone (not that they are necessary), but there is no incentive to even go back in after a while. I honestly felt the aiming was a bit off and floaty and you can jump way too high. The art style is nice, but seeing flat blocks everywhere will hurt your eyes after a while, not to mention a lot of people are tired of the Minecraft rip-offs and clones. If the developers spent more time on this game it could really stand out on its own.As of today the servers are pretty empty. They were really full when I first got the game, but now you’re lucky if you can find one or two full matches. This game has so much potential, but it feels half done. The hit detection doesn’t feel right, the guns don’t feel right, and the lack of classes, modes, and rewards will bore player early on. I recommend waiting for some major updates before purchasing, but if you really want a Minecraft type fragfest then go ahead.--Score: 7/10"

Of course, some classes might be better for certain maps and game modes, but I feel thats a given. For certain game modes its great to be strategic and dig up from beneath them or approach from the back. There are very little hackers in the game. I've only seen two. I have never experienced bad lag in the game. A lot of people say they do, but thats because they use the game finder instead of the server list. ALWAYS use the server list and sort the servers by ping. If you play on a server with high ping thats youre fault, not the games, so don't complain about lag. The game gets a ton of hate because its different from the original game before Jagex bought it. I honestly like this version better.

I swear 60% of players are marksmen. Why? Because the marksman is over powered. One shot kills with 100% accuracy scoped if you put the crosshair on the enemy.

I spent several hours mining, digging, exploding, and blasting my way into enemy bases.  Playing with friends is more rewarding in this game than in most FPS's because you could - say - quickly construct a fort / defense / offensive position with them.  Or mine your way to the enemy base unseen - working together to make the trek much faster.  This makes for a completely unique experience.The weapons are fun, and pretty much what you would expect in a first person shooter.  You get classes (Soldier, Tech., Ect) but these don't go beyond anything you would normally see (save for a jet-pack and being able to rocket jump).  They all perform as you would expect and they do not disappoint.Overall, I'd recommend this game if it is on sale.

I don't say this lightly. Its main innovation is that it allows heavy map modification in game. It's a delight to play. It is well balanced regarding classes, the graphics and art stle are not for ooh's and ahh's but appeal in a naive and amusing manner that doesn't require heavy graphics. There is a special kind of delight you get when you see a blockheaded man that looks like a Lego person with a gun teabagging his dead opponent. Oh, and the game awards points (although not many) to the teabagger. This adds to a light hearted, funny, yet violently competitive game experience. The user base is  immature to an extent, but within a very reasonable degree for an essentially online game suitable, regarding content, for children/young teens and anyone older. The community as about large enough to enjoy the most popular game types with large amounts of players within any regular western playing hours, but it's difficult to find the least popular game types, particularly at the odd hours. The game has no story/adventure mode or single player mode. There are no NPCs or bots in multiplayer games.** Rating / Score **I'd give it a solid 8.7/10. I highly recommend this game to anyone with an interest in First Person Shooters, even those who found the genre vaguely lacking in the past. Here's the breakdown.** Who this game is for **People who don't dislike first person shooters, players who have a knack for turn based or real time strategy, people who can enjoy a game with non high-end graphics and a retro art stle. People who don't mind a 100% online play game with no single player (besides the map editor), people who don't mind patches taking long to release, people who like lego, people who are constantly fighting and player killing in Minecraft and would like a faster pace.** Who this game is not for **People who don't like first person shooters, people who require realism and detail in graphics, people who want role playing game aspects in their first person shooters, people who want in-game levelling in their first person shooters, people who dislike children and teenagers to a large extent (i have found myself snapping and then apologizing to the most exasperating ones), people who require large communitites to play competitiviely regardless of daytime.** The good **Innovative, strategy-oriented, dynamic, fast paced, lots of creative and destructive chaos happening during gameplay, competitive, ruthless, funny, light in tone, decent user base, balanced, good for short bursts of fun with no story mode or single player. These aspects are accomplished masterfully in my opinion and justify the game completely, despite its sins.** The bad **Delightful as this game is, there is definitely room for improvement in the following aspects (i'm talking to you, Jagex). No single player practice against bots. This can make the game difficult to pick up for newbies. No story mode. No ability to create crude story mode quests through events and triggers in the map editor. Some gameplay aspects could use progress (such as inclusion of of more responsive/offensive infrastructure in the buildable set e.g. vehicles, traps) and the long time the community has taken to start playing custom maps in any widespread and meaningful way has seemed rather long. This is an indication of a small community that still needs growth. Maps are also, in most cases, torwards the large side, making  2 vs 2 player battles rather uneventful, yet recommendable for not so experienced players as they can be slower paced. During regular play hours finding 18 and less player games is usually possible within deathmatch mode, but not necessarily other game types. At least 8 are needed in a map for good fun in my opinion. Jagex has been slow in the past to release key patches. There was a large delay in a particular patch which basically made regular online play feasable. There was an issue where finding populated servers was very difficult.** The Boil down **The game is relatively cheap. At the time of writing this review it's around USD $15. If after reading this, you think you may be interested, i'd say give it a shot. Also, if you buy this game, all of your wildest dreams will come true. ;)** Anything Else? **Yes, if you would like to check a game that attempts something similar, look up Guncraft.** The part where i stop writing **Thank you very much for reading all the way down to here. If you're a skimmer you get partial credit. I hope you found my review useful! Happy gaming."

In this game, you can chose between up to 4 (I don't understand why the description says 7) classes and battle it out in a customisable game world. In other words, this game works like Guncraft, (though the original version came before.)Pros: Fun class based gameplay. Construction and hilarious demolition. Multiple modes, each with their own gimic. A constantly changeable environment.Cons: Game is quite arcadey, and some classes are overpowered. A small number of weapons leaving little variety. Tends to get old after a little while of playing.The thing that this game lacks is a sense of longevity. The older version of this was much more tactical. Structures actuallly meant something, as cover, since there were no drill cannons or RPGs to blow them up. The weapons are either overpowered or underpowered. Matches end very quickly, as some classes can fly across the map. And, unlike the Classic, there isn't an all-around good class. In Classic, there was only ONE class, and it could chose between three different guns. That, for me, makes it much better than this. It's just not solid.I would buy this on sale, if you were too.

In the games that I have played, it's ideal, but not necesssary to build during a game. However, most gamers rely on this for traps, obstacles, and blocking easy entrances to their base, and I applaud them for that. As for building your own arena, most people go on the public maps, so it's not likely anyone besides other friends will see your map.I stopped playing this a while ago, but while I did I loved it. Think of it as Minecraft combined with a version of TF2 that only has 4 classes...maybe...I found it very addicting, but however, it's a really simple game, and you might not be addicted for long. That was my case. The game is pretty simple:This is a map. There is one team's spawnpoint, and the other team's spawnpoint. You can use your weapons and tools to alter the map in any way you can (so long as a marksman doesn't shoot you in the face while doing so). Shoot the other team 'till they die and steal their flag.That's basically it.You have 4 classes, Commander (who has a missile launcher and a minigun), Marksman (who has a sniper rifle), Engineer (who uses an assault rifle and can place turrets), and Miner (who basically is the guy you rely on to dig secret tunnels to the other base). There's also the ""classic"" and the ""gangster"" classes, but they never appear on public servers, and therefore you will never use them. And I've never found a way to get any new weapons besides the few you start out with, which is a major disappointment.

My main annoyance at thsi game is that the original tests were centered around a rifleman class, with (you guessed it) a rifle. Yet, that class (or any basic sime-auto that isnt a sniper rifle for that matter) is no where to be found in this ""final"" release of the game. That is, unless you play ""Classic Mode"" which is thankfully the same as the original Beta, but hardly anyone ever hosts those servers, and when they do, they're almost always full.TL;DR it's a good shooter, but it's hit or miss if you'll like it or not."

In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, and nutmeg.2. In another bowl, beat the eggs and then whisk in the milk and vanilla.3. Melt the butter in a large cast iron skillet or griddle over medium heat.4. Whisk the butter into the milk mixture. Add the wet ingredients to the flour mixture, and whisk until a thick batter is just formed5. Keeping the skillet at medium heat, ladle about 1/4 cup of the batter onto the skillet, to make a pancake. Make 1 or 2 more pancakes, taking care to keep them evenly spaced apart. Cook, until bubbles break the surface of the pancakes, and the undersides are golden brown, about 2 minutes. Flip with a spatula and cook about 1 minute more on the second side. Serve immediately or transfer to a platter and cover loosely with foil to keep warm. Repeat with the remaining batter, adding more butter to the skillet as needed.6. Procedure for adding fruit to pancakes: Once the bubbles break the surface of the pancakes, scatter the surface with sliced or diced fruit, or chocolate chips, nuts, etc. Flip with a spatula and cook for 1 minute more, being careful not to burn toppings."

I was 13 years old and kind of stupid. Also I didn't play many shooters then so by my standards this game seemed pretty good.Of course a year later, I started noticing some cracks. I would only play Team Death Match, Capture the Flag, Classic CTF and Zombie because all the other modes were dull. Soon afterwoods I noticed that even then, zombie mode was the only mode I found consistently fun. I hung on for a while but once I started playing better shooters Ace of Spades looked less appealing. The breaking point occured one day when I was killed in a Team Death Match game. I reaspawned in a pit, looked up and to my horror, saw the entire enemy team on top of the pit picking us off like fish in a barrel. I died, reaspawned and died again at which point I thought ""♥♥♥♥ this"" and closed the game down.After nearly two years, I returned to see if anything had changed. Well it is still pretty much the same. Only difference is now you get to pay £5.59 for the privilege of having two extra classes.Don't bother wasting time and money on this when you can get CSGO for £11.99. Granted you might still have anoying kids yelling at you but at least the actual shooting as half decent. Alternitavely, buy TF2 and save your money entirely. Practically anything is better than this."

The buying point for me was hearing it was ""If Minecraft and Team Fortress 2 had a baby, it would be this game"". There are blocks, yes, but building blocks has no purpose as a defensive use, and destroying them is simple. The guns are also competent, but I would have liked more adversity to them, like Team Fortress 2.

Not a bad thing, but if you're in North America, I haven't come across many north american players. Too many people choose commando as a class, and will camp at your spawn with rockets, destroying your base so you have no way to get out, which means you'll die tons of times before you get a chance to kill them. If they can't see you, they'll throw grenades in the pit they've made which is now where you spawn. I tend to get frustrated with the way this game has turned into something like an LoL community.Players are rude to each other, and there's virtually no moderation/discipline. If I have friends online, I'll play with them on custom maps, locked with a password.

There are some things that aren't quite amazing about it, however. No game is perfect, but when you find your niche in AoS, it can be really fun.I had first played Ace of Spades after watching a YouTuber do an indie test drive of the game. It was simple, unique, and loads of fun. I played for hours in the early stage of the game. Fast forward a year or so (I can't recall the exact time period), and I had begun my Steam adventures. It was pretty excited to find AoS on the front page, becuase I remembered how much fun it was before. I opened it up only to find a completely different game from what I had previously played. It was entertaining, but it wasn't something that was played very often by me.The newer version of the game just wasn't enjoyable. The Marksman were too common which resulted in barely being able to do anything in the open. The Miner allowed you to dig across the map which almost no effort or risk. The Commando involved a rocket launcher, which if used correctly results in an instant death. I found it difficult to do much of anything on the Engineer class. There just wasn't the strategic aspect that I had come to love about the previous game. It can still be fun to play, especially on Zombie Mode, but I wouldn't recommend getting AoS purely for the new Deathmatch versions.It wasn't until I discovered there was still a Classic Capture the Flag gamemode that I fell in love with the game. Classic CTF is a simple, yet complex gamemode that really made the game fun. It was one class (in custom matches there is an SMG and Shotgun) which keeps things fair. It was a challenge to divide your team for each task at hand. One would need enough players to defend, yet enough to try and get the opposing team's flag. It really comes down to skill; how well you can shoot, how well you can build, and how well you can plan attacks. I played for hours and even ended up joining a clan. That made it even better because I had a close group of people that I could work together with. It's a nice community when you find the right people.All in all, it's a good game. I would reccomend it to anyone who wants a unique FPS game. It's just fun. There's no other way to put it. The newer version really isn't all that great, but Classic is simply amazing. Well worth the money."

Even with all the complaints about the game being ruined, Jagex has managed to do nothing but shove a few weapons and tiny overpriced DLCs in our faces along with tiny balance changes hoping to satisfy us. The game is initially good, but gets dry quickly. Definetly not worth fifteen dollars."

,Recommended,224540,8209692,"Posted: 22 December, 2013",all,Werewolfen,"At first glance Ace of Spades looks like the lovechild of Team Fortress 2 and Minecraft, and this belief is confirmed as soon as you hunker down in your first game.  Environments are fully customizable and destructible as you build and break everything in your path while fighting the enemy team in the process.  The range of game modes vary from team oriented modes like CTF and Team Deathmatch, to environment oriented like Demolition and Diamond Mine, although the latter doesn't stop certain individuals from killing everyone in their path instead of focusing on the objective.  You aren't limited to these parameters at all, and can make your own game mode for you and your friends.Despite the game's claim of seven available classes, you'll only see four of them most of the time.  The Commando and Marksman classes are fitted toward killing the enemy team, while the Engineer and Miner are suited toward environment construction and demolition respectively.  Each class comes with a different array of tools, weapons, and block formations that you can build from blocks you start with or collect from the environment.  Different tools and weapons have different effectiveness against player and environment: The Miner's Super Spade can mow through blocks at a time, while the Commando's Antipersonnel grenade greatly damages players with minimal impact to nearby blocks.  Choosing the right class and loadout can make the difference between a win and a loss.The only major flaw is that the game uses more resources than I anticipated.  I was forced to set all graphics settings to minimum and still suffered a moderate amount of lag.  I would strongly suggest this game, but make sure that your computer can handle it before you consider purchasing."

I think that Ace of Spades WAS an awesome game. It had everything I liked: it was different, interesting, creative, wierd and a quite a cool community. The problem that I have with this game is that it is TOO DIFFERENT to the original. It gave itself a different vibe and became less about keeping it simple and cool and more about what could we do to make a game with the same ideas and concept but entirely different. And then they thought let's make it cost money and change the art style. Let's add new gamemodes but still keep a classic mode in. Also we could add jetpacks and prebuilt structures.What I think is that to improve this make the game more about your buildings and strategic play. Keep it simple but keep it true to it's original. I would like there to be that little supportive community that was really fun to play with and I want it more about the tunneling and building. Helping out your team by creating forts and even little ditches to hide in. I want  the need for some features and I don't want prebuilt structures I don't mind them there but I think it takes away from the creativity of building your own fort.I think it's a good game but in my OPINION I think that it wasn't like it was and for that I give it a 5/10NOTE (READ BEFORE COMMENTING ON THIS REVIEW) :This is my OPINION if you think I'm wrong that's your opinion just don't commment saying I'm an idiot."

Then came the updates. The big ones that nerfed everything, ruined the gameplay's shining qualities, and just lost its luster in my book.They never fixed the Commando reskin after a halloween update about a year back, along with its horrible attempt at a rocket jumping launcher.The Rocketeer, known as Engineer now, used to be a good class before they started playing around with the jetpacks, completely removing the balanced one replacing it with either a glide jetpack or a jump jetpack. Then even worse, they removed the glide jetpack altogether! It's probably the worst class now.The marksman used to be a WAY overused class, and it still is today, even after they nerfed one of the rifles by giving it a laser sight. Too many CoD and Minecraft imports wanna be pr0 1337 with it, and it just is too... i don't know... bad.Lastly, the miner is the only real usable class for me personally, with a shotgun and mining shovel going to the bare essentials the game tries to convey.

If you enjoy a fast paced game, will plenty of content and a good (most of the time) community look here!Classes; The 4 classes of the game, miner, sniper, engineer, and commando, all have their own advantages. The commando is the mid ranged destroyer, the sniper being the long-ranged dominator, the engineer being the tactical strategist,a dn the miner being the close-ranged troll. Whetever your strategy is, you'll probably find it in this game!Modes; There are plenty of modes to choose from, from the classic TDM, destructive Multi Hill, and the awesome VIP. IN addition; if you want a slower game, there is classic CTF (Capture the Flag) which is a 90 minute game where teamwork matters.Zombie; This mode, is possibly the most fun. You can either run around as a miner, blowing out zombie brains with a shotgun, or heaping up points as a sniper far away. In addition; who doesn't want to be a zombie, tearing the human's constructs down and feasting on their flesh?Maps; The official maps, well some could use some work. Arctic base, the green team has a direct line of sight into the blue's at all times, and London is very open. However, most of the maps are decent, and there's the ability to make your own maps and share them with the community, so the world can know of your ingeniuty!Community; The community in Ace of Spades is big (in my opinon) There are plenty of clans, some commpettitve, and some for just having fun. There are your friendly people, and there are the un-friendly people, but you can just ignore them. When people say ""this game is dead"" don't listen, they're just hating.

Bots/Offline Mode - For people who have bad internet or have no internet or for those who just want to practice this would be a great thing to have and to test maps you have made, this would be difficult but sales would improve!3.

Characters are pretty adorable, and classes are varied quite a bit. Maps could be a bit better, but players often destroy/build so much that few really play out the same way. A previous update also unlocked the DLC maps and modes for all players, which was nice. They also added a new map editor to the game for those who really want to build up their own maps, which is pretty cool in my opinion. The modes are also pretty diverse with Classic (WW2 mode), TDM, Capture the Flag, VIP, Zombie, Diamond Mine, and a few more that I can't recall atm.As of writing this (November 25, 2013), the population seems active enough, and luckily issues of lag are minimal. There are usually at least 5/6 games filled with people to play with across a few modes. So as a multiplayer only game, I'd say this game is still alive and very much not a ghost town.My score: 8/10"

When you buy this game, 95% of the time, you will not find a server at all. Single player would've helped. But even if it did have single player, it would still be bad.

It was really fun and at first was worth my money and I had a lot of fun with it.But picking the game back up again I'm amazed on how much it has changed in just a few updates. They completely destroyed the engineer class by getting rid of his jet pack which allowed him to glide across the map, it was the best counter for sniper classes. I think the reason why they nerfed him was because of the ability to spawn camp really easily but all you needed to do was maybe not be able to go into enemy spawning points...or not being able to place turrets where enemy spawns.This game has turned into a complete sniper game. You can't go into a server anymore without there being 5 or more people being a sniper, just because that class is now most over-powered. Miners make it easier to spawn camp also getting to enemy spawning points really easily and using the shot gun to one shot most classes. I try not to stay one class the entire game but I'm finding myself playing a heavy class or a sniper class just to get the enemy's from killing me the first few seconds of me spawning.This game had a huge potential to be a great Minecraft like game just with guns, but they completely ruined it with just a few updates.Jagex is turning into a complete JOKE of a game company and are now becoming known for ruining game likes Runescape and now Ace of Spades. After their recent update they released an entire DLC for free.. they completely ripped off the people who bought the DLC and acting like the DLC was some kind of contribution is what pisses people off the most, I wouldn't dare to buy a DLC from Jagex ever because of what they did.I wouldn't recommend this game to ANYONE really. The only reason WHY it should even be bought is when it's on a big sale or something. Otherwise please don't play this game or else you will feel like you just got ripped off."

This is what all of those knockoffs tried to be as successful as but failed to do. Despite the overwhelming majority of negative reviews, most of which being inflated, all i need is for you guys toHEAR ME OUT.Some of the pros that come with the game is how it's easy for newcomers and casuals of the genre to play, with classes having a slight variation of weapons to chose from. Although there are not many weapons, they are simple key attributes to certain classes to suit to different play styles.Another pro about this game that i would like to point out is how although it plays like your traditional FPS, one person won't always guarantee victory, but having a team isn't neccessary to win. There are an indefinant amount of ways to go about a game, and no two games will play out the same way, as the combination of all of these different people with their own thought process adds to the originality of a typical game.One MAJOR con to the game, and one that haters tend to exaggerate from the moon and back is how Jagex ""ruined the game"" with the updates and left it to die. Unfortunantly, they have long since stopped work on the game to move forwards to work on different projects. I, for one, have played Ace of Spades before the ""Battle Builder"" aspect was implemented, and I can see what approach Jagex was attempting to make, which was to make the map of the game more interactive and and plenty of more levolution into the game. However, many have gone on to claim that they greatly preferred how the game was before the creative attribute was added and since then, have gone on to raid the Ace of Spades game review sections with miniscule and unexplained reasons to why they dislike the game, which is why it is in what people tend to call, the ""Steam Trash Bin"", despite the massive community change that has happened in the past few years.Another major downside to AOS is how small the community is nowadays, after being completely riddled with negativity years ago. The player count at its highest daily, as of when this post was made, is about 50-ish people playing at the same time. This, in turn, also led Jagex to stray away from AOS development, as they have since stopped working on the game when the community for the game dropped below 10,000. Remember, this was back in late 2014. Two years later, and the many that were left have turned into the measley few that we are today.I was fortunate enough to have bought this game on sale with the ""Hurt+Heal"" pack for around 10 USD. To my surprise, it was a relatively great game with a humble community, especially taking into account the fact that I hardly looked into the reviews. The game looked fun, the concept looked crafty, and I bought it. Even to this day, I still find myself playing it from time to time.TL;DR: Good game, haters made community shrink, still good game"

It's not what it used to be, therefore I must see it as a different game with the same name.So what can I say about Ace of Spades? It most certainly is fun. You can build and destroy in real time while your team is fighting against the enemy. It's a first person shooter where you can choose between multiple classes and use them with your team and work together to defeat the enemy.There are loads of game modes to play, my favourite being the zombie mode. The aim is to survive as long as you can until you are the last player alive, the funny thing is, once you die, you become a zombie to infect others. It's very fun.The first person shooter mechanics are okay, nothing spectacular mostly because of the terrible damage differences (for balance I assume). Most players just use sniper because it's the only weapon worth using, I hate snipers but found myself being forced to use it if I had any hope in killing other plays.So if you like a sniping fest of a game, this is for you I guess.I recommend it soley because it is fun, I can't deny that. I really enjoyed playing it and for the cheap price it's at during sales you can't really go wrong.So get it, play it, kill folk and have a fun time!"

The classes are very unbalanced. There are 4 classes in the game but only 2 are of any use in regular gamemodes. The sniper and the heavy are the 2 classes people play as the most. The sniper class is equiped with a sniper rifle that takes people out in one headshot, and the heads are very big in this game. And the Heavy carries a minigun and a rocket launcher, this loadout makes it a beast at close quarters combat.The strong parts of this game are the completely destructable terrain that falls when you take out the suports. The game also allows you to make your own maps. But since nobody plays the game the custom servers usually have 1-5 players on them.In all it is a bad game that has potential to be great."

It's not a bad game.The gameplay is alright if a bit fast.  There are only four classes and they're somewhat generic (commando, sniper, engineer, miner).  The biggest draw has to be the destroyable terrain but it honestly doesn't come up so much.  The problem is that digging under your enemy to catch them from behind might work once or twice -- or all map, maybe -- but the maps are so large that it takes a very long time to do so, effectively nullifying any benefit you would gain from it.  Additionally, because the maps are so large the game favors the sniper class a bit heavily.Of course there is a map maker so if you don't want huge maps then by all means make or play on smaller ones.  The trouble there is that structures cease looking like structures due to limited size, but whatever.Zombie mode is fun.For an indie game I think the servers are quite lively (as of a few minutes ago there were about 20/30 fairly full servers).The main problem is I don't know how it compares to other minecraft-esque shooters at the moment.  Right now I think I would prefer to find a group of people and play a minecraft mod that adds guns rather than this.Still, not a bad game, if you think it'll interest you then check it out.  Just prepare to be disappointed by the building-related aspects.  Still, you can pull off some cool things if you're interested in doing that and not getting the best kills per time ratio (or whatever)."

Classic mode, unlike most FPS's, will greatly encourage you to think with battlefield strategy. Diversion tactics, building defensible positions, creating secret passages, and much more are standard. Much more than any twitch-shooter could ever hope to supply in an FPS; you will plan, strategize, assult, and make wise (mis)use of terrain to acheive victory."

It has a lot of fast-paced action and the map destruction is something that makes the game better. With the integration of the steam workshop it is possible to download maps from other games such as Counter-Strike: Global Offensive and play them in a way in which they have never been played for example the ability to jump on the roofs, blow up the doors and floors of the map which makes it great fun.I recommend this game if you want a quick laugh but if you're playing this solo then i wouldn't.WARNING: after the last update (BATTLE BUILDER) for me the game have destroyed first they nerf most of the characters.secondly after the most community start to leave. and thirdly the servers are all most dead, they take 1 kill 1 shot ( ist not bad or hack but for me i am getting a little mad) and the game ist not funny any more.

Admittedly i hadn't given it much time when i bought it in classic, but i have had countless (okay they track my hours played, but still ....) hours of fun, and gotten 25 other friends playing so far, we all enjoy it.Yes there were changes made. Some things were fixed, some may not have been, others were left to be played in an available classic mode. Overall though, for the number of people that have purchased and played this title it seems like a strong choice, and especially since most probably bought it on sale like myself and my friends.People mention the lack of strategy as compared to the previous version but with the tunneling and mix of classes and defensive build choices, i have to say i am still amazed each day at how many strategies people come up with in all the different modes. Its great!And all of the achievements are attainable (although some will having you gritting your teeth) unlike some of the games out there. Put your time in and i am pretty positive that you can all knock them off your list.I would have to say my only complaint is the abuse of the voting system, noone even bothers to ask why someone is being banned or kicked, yet they will cast a vote against that person, so often you will get the trolls or griefers causing problems and either nothing can be done or the wrong individual will get banned."

This is a review of the game 'Ace of Spades'TL;DR, score of 7.5/10Quick Overview:Well, This game is awesome.I like FPS games, I like minecraft, and I got this.You have many options and a bit of fantasy (like you can fly).Switching between guns or weapons is pretty important in FPS games (let's have M16 for all time- meh) so you can change rockets vs players or that destroys more blocks...Snipers are still a bit imbalanced but at least you can see a laser from their scope so you know where to shoot.Something really funny is you can in some clicks build your own fortress, slowing your enemy and flying away (if engineer) or leaving some mines there.There's also a map creator where you can build maps and upload to the steam workshop.The most played mode is Deathmatch but still, the others as well (not sayin' that Deathmatch isn't fun).And the original PROS and CONS:Let's start with the PROS, shall we?:+Enjoyable FPS, comfortable+Building function+Map editor + workshop+Not huge community, but has a lot of players+Classes, and guns to choose from+Statics (Kills, deaths, maps played etc.)+Achievements+Cards+Half voice actedAnd now- the cons:-Building big things at one time (those who are already made) make the game lag-Almost and only deathmatch is played-Snipers are imbalanced"

,Recommended,224540,8476218,"Posted: 1 January, 2014",all,NimrodX,"This is a very good simple FPS game with elements of building and sapping thrown in. It's basically a stripped-down version of the system in ""Factions"" survival servers in Minecraft, but don't expect it to replace MC or anything because like I say it's rather stripped down to the essence. This is good because you can pick it up immediately. The class system is well balanced, and you can pick a class that focuses on frontal assault, sniping, or building defensive structures or sapping the enemy structures. (All classes have weapons and build/destroy capabilities, but some are much better at different things than others.)This is a great game for when you want some FPS shoot-em-up fun where weapons destroy voxels and the strategy isn't super complex or super involved. And to make things better, if you feel more like building or tearing stuff down to help out your more heavily armed yet no so structurally inclined team members you can pick a support class that gets major bonuses to those things at the cost of some direct offensive power.So it's not a Minecraft replacement, but it's also not just a crunchy pixel shooter with editable voxel-based arenas. If you were expecting the latter then the game will probably exceed your expectations."

,Not Recommended,224540,19951448,"Posted: 25 December, 2015",all,Gwathdring,"Playing this game prior to its commercial release was quite interesting. It had a unique feeling; it captured a sensation of dread and desolation, of lonliness on the battlefield. You could make brave forays into enemy territory, you could dig sneaky tunnels, you could build silly structures, you could dig a horrendous mess near your team's objective to kinda screw up the game ... but the core mechanics had a grimly satisfying feel to them. It was play war, it was very silly play war, but it managed to feel like a game that understood the tactical and personal discomfort of trench warfare in a way many more serious and thematic games do not.This was an artifact of a few of it's mechanics (in particular the specifics of how digging tunnels worked) crossed with its stark visuals and its minimalism. By prettying the game up, complicating the core game loop, and loosening up combat to a more familiar online multiplayer feeling ... the game lost track of what made it more interesting than other multiplayer games in my collection. Sure, you can still build and dig, but it doesn't quite feel right. I'm not normally one for nostalgia and minimalism--typically the march of time and increased visual/mechanical variety improves a game. Here, it feels like the developer vision was not in sync with what made the game most interesting and most worth playing.A shame. It's not terrible, and if you like the idea of digging and building with cubes in a hectic multiplayer arena shooter go for it. For my time, it doesn't have anything really special to offer though it certainly did much earlier in development. :("

,Recommended,224540,1764218,"Posted: 13 May, 2013",all,Mr.Epic,"With the 1980 release of Ace of Spades, Motörhead had their anthem of anthems -- that is, the title track -- the one trademark song that would summarize everything that made this early incarnation of the band so legendary, a song that would be blasted by legions of metalheads for generations on end. It's a legendary song, for sure, all two minutes and 49 bracing seconds of it. And the album of the same name is legendary as well, among Motörhead's all-time best, often considered their single best, in fact, along with Overkill. Ace of Spades was Motörhead's third great album in a row, following the 1979 releases of Overkill and Bomber, respectively. Those two albums have a lot in common with Ace of Spaces. The classic lineup -- Lemmy (bass and vocals), ""Fast"" Eddie Clarke (guitar), and ""Philthy Animal"" Taylor (drums) -- is still in place and sounding as alive and crazed as ever. The album is still rock-solid, boasting several superlative standouts. Actually, besides the especially high number of standouts on Ace of Spades -- at least relative to Bomber, which wasn't quite as strong overall as Overkill had been -- the only key difference between this 1980 album and its two 1979 predecessors is the producer, in this case Vic Maile. The result of his work isn't all that different from that of Jimmy Miller, the longtime Rolling Stones producer who had worked on Overkill and Bomber, but it's enough to give Ace of Spades a feeling distinct from its two very similar-sounding predecessors. This singular sound (still loud and in your face, rest assured), along with the exceptionally strong songwriting and the legendary stature of the title track, makes Ace of Spades the ideal Motörhead album if one were to choose one and only one studio album. It's highly debatable whether Ace of Spades is tops over the breakthrough Overkill, as the latter is more landmark because of its earlier release, and is somewhat rougher around the edges, too. Either way, Ace of Spades rightly deserves its legacy as a classic. There's no debating that."

If you do, you'll be missing out on a fun title that takes pieces of multiple genres and snaps them together like children's building blocks.At it's core, Ace of Spades is a competent shooter with most of the staples you'd expect today:  classes, weapon selection (albeit limited) and large, open maps.  What differentiates it is the fact that everything on the map can be destroyed.  I mean it - everything.  I'm not talking pre-designed collapse in a building from a tank shell or artillery strike, but rather block-by-block devastation.  Add to this the fact that all classes are able to place blocks (or pre-fab structures) down on the map at will, and you'll see the landscape of a round change completely in only ten or so minutes.  Forts are built and destroyed.  Snipers erect networks of towers that fall to crafty engineers.  Vast, sky-bridging platforms extend from one base to another, only to be eliminated by a stray rocket that plunges six men to their doom.  Opposition too stiff on the front lines?  Mine out a tunnel into their base like a medieval sapper and hit those pesky snipers from behind.Ace of Spades offers several game types, although only two of them are consistently played on populated servers.  Team Deathmatch needs no explanation.  The second is Zombie mode.  In this, the start of the round sees one or two random players become the zombie.  They must hunt down the other players using blips on their minimap and claw them to death, thus creating a new zombie.  Non-zombified players will erect vast defenses in the vain hope of staying alive for a few extra minutes.  Overall, quite a lot of fun.  I wish more of the modes were played because some of them are really good, but it's still a lot of fun and worth the $15.Server load is low at this point, and was even when I first got the game in 2013.  You might find 2-3 full or semi-full servers in your region depending on time of day, but it's usually enough.To sum up,Pros:-  First Person Shooter goodness on maps that can be completely destroyed by the players.  Watch as landscapes rise and fall all through human effort.  Dig secret passages into enemy bases, destroy their carefully-built structures and be a general nuisance.-  A mild building element allows players to construct temporary defenses to aid in their skirmishes, leading to interesting scenarios as players deal with what are essentially castle sieges.-  Fun, fast-paced action combined with sneaky digging and relaxed building.  The game rewards you for doing basically anything that you'd like to do.  It is, after all, a LEGO set with guns.-  Pretty much bug-free.  I've had one or two lock-ups in nearly 40 hours of play.-  Casual-friendly.  Great for short-period time-killing or for longer stretches.Cons:- Snipers.  Every single round sees 75% of the players taking the role of sniper.  More variety would be nice, especially given the fact that other classes can manipulate the map in far more interesting ways.-  Autobalance issues.  Good luck joining a round with a friend and getting on the same team.  Autobalance kicks in even during the opening moments when players are loading between maps, and it isn't possible to change teams (in spite of a change teams button) unless you quit and re-join.  On the other hand, if half a team drops during a match the game won't autobalance to adjust for that, so you can sometimes see 10 v 5 scenarios.-  Liberal kick-votes.  It seems in most rounds that half a dozen players or more will be the target of an unexplained, undefended kick vote.  Usually for ""Hacking,"" even though I have yet to see a hacker in many dozens of rounds.  In spite of the map being easily destructible (and rebuildable, like a LEGO set), many players will take offense if someone so much as damages a block they've placed down with a stray bullet.  Erroneous ""Griefing"" kickvotes pop up all the time - usually because a sniper gets mad when someone blows up their tower.  Never mind that they can just build a new one in half a second.  If you get irrationally angry when people damage something you've made, even if you can rebuild it quickly and with minimal effort, you might not like this game very much.Overall, Ace of Spades is well worth $15.  If you consider the price of a movie in theatres and the amount of enjoyment you could get out of this game, the price is a steal.  If you wait for a sale you'll be even better off.DISCLAIMER:  The video on Steam shows players flying around with brown jetpacks, painting things and building complex structures.  I think that was the developer's attempt to show an artistic representation of their own map-building process.  If you buy this game thinking you can join unlimited-time servers and tool around like in Minecraft, you'll be disappointed.  Rounds are about 15 minutes apiece and anything you build can and *will* be destroyed.Additionally, many of the reviews for this game are quite negative.  Ignore the old-timers comparing it with the free version from ages past and just take it for what it is - a shooter with maps you can blow up at will.  I have to wonder if some of these people even know what fun is that they consider Ace of Spades a bad game.  After a quarter century of gaming and playing the same experiences in new boxes dozens of times, I am genuinely delighted to have a game that is so different from the rest."

Frountier spawns you in a feild with no cover, Great Wall spawns you behind a temple, Block Ness spawns you either behind a hill or in the crater where the snipers can pick you off easily, Spooky Mansion spawns you among headstones (enough said), and Arctic Base spawns you at the base of a steap hill (or cliff depending on how much you hate climbing.)Too bad all custom made levels are made in a server that can crash at any time.You can place blocks and structures but I can't figure out how it determines where I want them to go.The teams are blue and green but the level fog makes players look blue at a distance.Get use to the words ""is dominating you"" your going to get that a lot.I regret buying this game please don't buy it."

And this game lets you do just that. But why would you want to? You can just pick up a jetpack and ignore every single barrier that the enemy builds. The matches are too short anyway, you can't exactly build a base in the time you're given in every single match. And even if you had time and a purpose to build them, you'd still struggle to build anything since building is extremely clumsy. Don't expect to build as easily as you can in Minecraft.The gunplay is absolutely awful. The animations are laughable! Even Minecraft's animations are better most of the time. Some animations that should exist don't even exist. For example; recoil animations. They're simply non-existant. When you fire your gun, the weapon just changes its position (recoil) without any animation at all, which is ridiculous. When you aim down sights, same thing; no animation. The animations that do exist are awful, as I said before. The digging animation, for example, is almost as bad as Minecraft's.The graphics are pretty bad. The blocks could at least have some textures, but they don't. Their ""textures"" are just solid colors. I gotta say, however, that maps do look good if you're not actually close to them...The optimization is awful. The game just doesn't run well. Sure, my PC isn't really a gaming PC, but it should easily run this game considering how it looks.The guns also look bad. They have the same quality as the blocks, which is just unforgivable, since you'll be actually looking at them.Overall, a cool concept (building and shooting does seem fun), but it's just not well executed."

Gotta love having your view blocked.The choice between the only 2 snipers is still very obvious, sick, patchnotes say increased aim down sights, start the game, try it out, OpieOp still the same OP♥♥♥♥♥♥Like really, if you take the green and big sniper you will regret it, if you nerfed to ammo to 0 on the other one too it maybe would be viable?Sick a new update for the commando class! Oh wait its a ♥♥♥♥ing parachute, nice one, just wonderful, isnt it OP just gliding through the air slow as ♥♥♥♥ and getting sniped, blown up or simply just getting shot awesome and rewarding gameplay?Take a look at the BASE jumper in tf2, not a really good weapon, what makes it good is the fact that you can combo it with a special rocketlauncer witch makes it an okay choice. Here you have a red hotdog that hits for 3 dmg per hit and tickles the blocks near the explosion.The radar actually is pretty fun, seems balanced to me about 90% of the time I forget I have mines and I just dont use them. You plonk that thing down and you have a little bit more of map awearness for like 45 sec, overall its okay, nohting too good.The disguise thing is just for ♥♥♥♥ing with new players, honestly if you have played the game a little bit, you shouldnt have problems with noticing 3 blocks with a false rotation moving around the map.The new miner explosive seems pretty OP compeared to the the other bomb, in the weapon select screen it says it doesnt do as a big explosion as the other one, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t I say! Its better then the other one, you can time your explosions, you can get about 1 kill with it but then again that would require camping, camping = not fun, timing your explosions is pretty much useless.Now to the price, you get 2 classes a few weapons and thats bassicly it!?How is a poor ♥♥♥♥♥♥ like me gonna buy that?I cant judge the new classes or weapons because I cant buy the dlc right now.But as it seems the medic is gonna be pretty much useless, look at any kind of a support charecther almost in any other game, nobody wants to play them. Heal seems pretty okay because most of the time you kill someone and then loose a little bit of health.The shield is probably gonna suck♥♥♥♥♥♥ protecting yourself in a small arc in a fps isnt that useful, the part I love in this game is that you can almost always flank people, come in from the side, underground or even the sky. Light machien gun seems pretty bad, sniper beats it long range, sniper beats it medium range, and any other primary can beat it in short range.Medic seems uselessNow Im reeally exited for the specialist class, the grenade launcher has a possiblity of becoming the weapon that recks every other wep in short to medium range, maybe even long. Auto shotgun also the same thing, they both seem above avarage. Also the poison granade seems very interesting. The sticky grenade might also produce funny moments where you die but the granade you threw stuck to the enemy and you still kill him.Also Im waiting for the mine launcher, might be the same deal with the auto shotgun.Very very exited for the new commando primary might do the same thing as the auto shotgun.In short, the game is still playable and very fun, ecpecialy with friends!Sorry for my bad english, not my primary language.I dunno, I worte this in a sudden rage when I saw that you fixed some minor bugs and not the fact that there are only 2 vip maps and only 1 of them is playable. Like Jesus Crist, is it that hard to make a new tower for the blue on alcatrac? Is it that hard to make a few deathmatch maps into vip maps? Like, they dont even have to be balanced, but It would just make the VIP expiriance a lot less dull.Btw a major issue with pros playing zombimode, they pick miner and shotgun you to death if you get close to them, Its nearly impossible to kill them, Ive seen 3 guys beat 20 zombies.Btw there is a major issue with class balanceing, sniper beats any class long range, the only thing that counters him there is more snipers, If you are good with sniper you can still do 1v3-s and win long range.Medium range, engineer and commando beat you, if you are good at the game you can headshot them before they reach you, if you are even better you can headshot them while in midrange combat.Shortrange, every class beats you, ecpecially miner. But then again you can run away, take cover and headshot them before they get close, even in close range if a miner misses his first shotgun round, you can still 30% kill them.Btw engineer is ♥♥♥♥ing useless, turret sucks, melee is same as other classes, primary wep is below avarage, literally a good sniper with a pistol kills them. Jetpack makes a hell a lot of noise so doesnt really give you an advantage in battle.I dont even know what Im even rambeling about anymoreIf you read this thank you for your time and have a good day!:steamhappy:"

This game used to have some people who wern't actually 10 year olds who rage at you if you do anything, but now people will kick you off a server if you so much as destroy a block. Something else that ruined the game was all the unnecessarly nerfs that just made the game less fun, one of the worst when they made the sniper rifle into a lazer pointer, which pretty much defeated the point of sniping. The only slightly entertaining game mode is classic, as it is somewhat balanced. As for the dlc maps, no one plays them so you basiclly wasted $5 if you bought them.

I didn't experience any derpy jumping or hlagging through blocks or any kind of annoying movement issues. It may sound like a trivial thing, but its important that the movement is good and with Ace of Spades this is definitly the case.The game modes are nice too. There's ofcourse the typical ones such as Zombies, which is basicly last man standing with a bit of a twist. The regular deathmatch works great too. And the mode where you have to secure a diamond is super fun!What I especially love about this game is that allthough you play games similar to a FPS, the maps are completely destroyable and buildable.This game is a very nice balance between Shooting and Building, as the name suggests.The gameplay mechanics are very well made.

You have to manage your money, and make sure that, when you get out a loan from the bank, you have enough money to pay it back, or are at least making enough daily profit to pay it back.You also manage a business. You can hire drivers to work for you, and they will complete jobs for you, but you have to pay them a wage, plus some for every journey they complete. You level up they skills, that make them be better at certian things, like you can make them earn more money for going over a set distance, or you can make them carry high value or fragile cargo. They can also carry ADR materials, so things that could be dangourous. But you get paid more for that.You can always do 'Quick Jobs', and these are when the employer provides the truck, and you just go where they tell you. This is fun, but it starts to get boring, only doing short deliverys, so you can buy a truck, so that you can go further distances, and get more money.To conclude, I feel that anybody who likes games like Farm Simulator, or any simulator game should give this game a try, because it is a great way to unwind after a long day, and I have found it to be so much fun and very calming. Some people say that this is a boring game, I happen to disagree."

Kick is broken, server crashes between level changes %50 of the time, people can glitch you and make you stuck in place, Commando's parachute is OP, and has ruined the zombie mode, and no one is playing anymore because Jagex does not care, has not fixed anything, is ignoring this game completely, and stopped posting to their AoS Facebook, and Twitter, and has blocked people from posting anything to the AoS Facebook. The final straw for me today was being glitched stuck in two different servers, at first I thought it was lag till I saw everyone else around me still playing. And to top it off, Jagex even hired a community manager, for BLOCK N LOAD. The community manager has the balls to come on our forum and tell us the kick bug is really complicated and they are trying to work on it. Excuse me? The kick feature was working just FINE, until you released obviously severely UNTESTED DLC to ROB everyone of their money and RUIN the game. Don't make excuses for your SPAGHETTI CODE, and lack of testing. Before this stupid DLC, the only bug I can remember was a glitched out glow block every now and then by an annoying Engineer. So please, save yourself, save your children, they be rapeng everyone out here in STEAM AOS LAND of their money, they be climbing in your wallet, snatching your money out! Hide the steam wallet, hide the kids, they be taking all that money out here.

I think I speak for everyone who played the original ace of spades when I say this game took the very concept that the original was built around and sha on it. Fortunately the original is still up onwww.buildandshoot.combut, Jagex took an incredible game and destroyed it. originally the game was slow paced and demanded teamwork. Riflemen covered submachine gunners who in turn covered shotgunners. Tunneling (the spade in 'ace of spades') was an effective way to out manuever enemies and fortifications were built one brick at a time. However, this new iteration destroys this balance, the matches are short CODesque affairs (avg. round is about 5mins), engineer's jetpacks negate the use of tunneling (even if they didnt, 5 minutes aren't enough time to effectively use tunnels anyway) and forts can be spawned in a snap. But the biggest insult comes through the sniper.

Even the original free-to-play was good, although they've ruined it in my opinion.The unbalanced classes and mechanics of a potentially good game ruin one of the main factors, building. Yes, I do realise that it's an FPS as well, but a major portion of the game is either ignored or abused because of classes that irradicate the need for these particular elements.I have put a decent amount of time into the game to make a fair-ish judgement I feel. There was a time whenever I really enjoyed Ace Of Spades. This was followed by a patch that caused every attempt to find a game void, or if successfully you would find yourself in a server with two people - which essentially led to me not playing anymore.The length of time that this was a problem was far too long, and in my opinion damaging to the community of the game."

I would recommend Block N Load over this game and it's 100% free unlike Ace of Spades which doesn't warrant it's price. In Block N Load you have character class types, a build phase, bases to defend and building defences is just as important as shooting other players, this is not the case in Ace of Spades you don't need to build here and people rarely do plus the classes and weapons are mundane. I honesty feel like they've tried to use the whole Minecraft hype to sell this game to younger players.My main problem with this game is it's sold with the title ""Battle Builder"" which is a false title.Occasionally people build a sniper tower but that's as far as placing blocks ever goes. The maps in this game are nice enough and you can see some thought as been put into maps like London/Big Ben and the voxel engine makes destruction nice but after an hour or so of game play it's just dull and repetitive as the shooter aspect is basic. There's no real skill to the weapons, no recoil it's just point and hold the mouse button down.The community is generally full of teenagers and younger gamers so lots of people mic spam and there seems to be many players who have slept with female members of your family. The community is small I feel they'd be better off making this free2play with micro transactions.Please don't pay for this game.Younger gamers who like voxel stuff may find this more entertaining than I do as its simple to learn and would run on a laptop or low spec PC."

So I saw Ace of Spades, and I took the plunge. Bought the game. Screwed the pooch. I took that dark, dismal plunge into an abyss of screechers, bad textures and poor game design. And I loved it. My juvenile and gullible self loved every second I could get my grimy mitts on to that mouse and play some good ol' Ace of Spades. Then I just forgot about it after seven hours playtime. I am lucky that I did not fall into an addiction. I am lucky that I did as I had done with Minecraft and dropped it soon before transforming into the stereotypical screecher. Every month or so after I have looked back and thought of this game more negatively. I now consider it an abomination of mankind that corrupts and mutates the youth into headphone-wearing, anthropomorphic animal-drawing social outcast memelords that watch too many vlogs and scripted Minecraft videos. I can only finish beating the dead horse once the horse's rotting and dessicated corpse becomes a primordial ooze that has been soaking into my baseball bat for a decade.Then I can put that smelly bludgeon down and call it a job well done. I can sleep knowing that I have reduced a being that Cthulhu himself can scarcely fathom into a dirty liquid that is made up of the most devolved and dead single-cell life forms. I hope Jagex sees this review so they know that their money-press is slowly forging a generation of overweight outcasts and weeaboos so that they can put an end to it. I knew a kid that fell victim. He couldn't stop talking about how good he was. He never stopped interrupting the history class to share pointless facts and show off. He always made 8-year-old level jokes and puns, or talked about ""crazy"" and ""wacky"" things.

Heres why: I see lots of potential for this game. Right now there is no class editor, but there is a thing where you can choose from 2 different guns per class but thats it. Also there are no custom prefabs, and barely any prefabs at all. And then in the workshop you can only make maps. No custom guns or prefabs. And this will probably lag you alot. If you really want this game go for it. But I suggest Guncraft, which has all the things AoS doesn't have.

You can build and destroy blocks which is cool as you try to blast away your enemies.  You can build your own maps.  It has a few different characters that have their own specific weapon load out but you can't modify them.  Game play is fun.Seems to be still a decent amount of players on-line.  Some people think this game isn't very good but I don't see any major problems with it.  I think it's way better than Guncraft and Mindcraft.

Would not buy this game unless under $5.00. I can't review Ace of Spades unbiased as I played the game when it was free god knows how long ago. Since then the classes have been ruined, the guns have been ruined and they've gotten rid of the old maps (the good ones) and given it new maps which are awful. Ace of spades also is falsely advertising when they say ' Up to 32 players choose from seven unique classes...' There are four classes, not seven. Commando, Engineer, Marksman and Miner are the classes. The classes are all ok but the Marksman got ruined by giving him a laser when he zooms in that everyone can see. This means you want to stealthily snipe someone, oh, too bad, we gave you a massive laser so everyone knows where you are, and you can't no scope cus this gun has awful accuracy from the hip. The only game mode which is most like the old version is classic ctf but even that is not as good as it used to be. Overall, I wish the old Ace of Spades would come back, but it won't, so goodbye Ace of Spades."

I, and many didn't like the news that the previously free to play multiplayer had been taken over and ""redefined"" by Jagex, the developer behind Runescape.AOS is a first-person shooter game with classes similary to the game Team Fortress 2. The classes have diffrent weapons and equipment that you can use to your advantage. The game main selling point is that the maps is entirely destructable and buildable and while it's certainly fun, I feel like it's hasn't been though out properly.Let me explain: The class Rocketeer is a character that have a jetpack attached to him. It tries to balanced itself with that you can shoot and explode the jetpack or it can overheat and explode if used to much. The problem is that building for example a defensive fort for your intel in a capture the flag gamemode, a rocketeer can just fly in with no problem.The community isn't all that great either, being that it has seen episodes of hackers, griefers and overall people cursing eachother out.The thing what saves it though, you may ask?The classic capture the flag. It is like the free game you played before. Just the rifle and grenades and your shovel. This encourage teamplay. Building and maintaining a fort to defend your intel and try to breach your enemies ones. Having a few friends and trying to strategize and plot a plan for victory.However that's just my 2 cents. A decent shooter with watered down with features that hasn't been well planned out.I wish they could add the 2 other WWII weapons and a few other Classic gamemodes for the old school AOS players. Still get a recommendation, but only on deep sales."

The game was just fine before and I loved all the original maps but now that people are using player made maps it makes it almost impossible to get into a battle. Before the iser-generated content update, matches were normally about 20 versus 20, however, now your lucky to get into a 2v2 match! I loved classic capture the flag, but now they have 3 different weapons instead of being limited to one, this seriously unbalances gameplay when you're only playing with 3 other people! I DO like the fact that players can create there own lobbys to play with their friends without having to set up a server, but still letting you customize gamerules like making players faster, allowing them to carry more base building blocks and toggling certain weapon options on and off. I don't like that they made the Valentine DLC come with all copies of the game 15 days after I bought it for extra though! This is a dump of thoughts about my greivences with the game. In my opinion this game is best when played in a LAN-party or close friends setting. I wouldn't purchase it otherwise at this point."

The game is split into three worlds, known as ""Impetus"", ""Tenacity"" and ""Triumph"" respectively, each containing 11 stages and a boss encounter. In each level, Commander Video runs automatically from left to right. To complete a level, the player must input certain commands on the controller, including jumping, sliding and kicking, to avoid or destroy obstacles and enemies. If Commander Video is hit by any object, he is immediately warped back to the beginning of the level and starts running again.During levels, the player obtains power-ups that upgrade the score multiplier, starting at 'Hyper' and progressing through 'Mega', 'Super', 'Ultra', and finally 'Extra'. As these multipliers are gained, the background music becomes more advanced accordingly, with new melodies being added and modern instrumentation layered on top. Commander Video is also able to collect gold bars distributed through the course of the levels - if all the gold bars in a level are acquired, the player is given access to a short bonus stage based on Pitfall, the famous Atari 2600 game programmed by David Crane."

If i were to sum up this game into one sentence i would say, A fun game for you to play for about twenty minutes at a time. This game is one of those few games that is a great idea and could have been a great game if it was done right. Im not saying this is not a good game, Its actually great for its type, The problem here is that its repetitive and there is no real objective.By repetitive, I mean it in the aspect of not only gameplay, but the game modes themselves. In a game like (dare I say it) Call of Duty multiplayer, You have different game modes, just like this game. The problem is that this game and Call of Duty do the same thing, Different game mode, Same gameplay feel. Of course, This is something many games can not do yet.What did i mean by ""No real objective""? Well in a game you want to have a reason to keep playing it. TF2, People play for upgrades and new items, CS:GO People play for new skins and going pro in the game, COD people play to get the highest rank. In a game like this, Its not very good at keeping you wanting more because there is no real goal. Nothing special to want you to try your best.Overall, Ive decided not to talk about how the game looks because im someone who believes that the look of the game is not what makes it good, Its the content. That being said, On a personal opinion I give the game a 6/10. I do recommend this game if you have some friends to play with but you really need to like these sort of games to be happy with your purchase.At $14.99, You most likely wont feel like you got your moneys worth until you have a good twenty hours in the game. As you can see, I only having five hours in game, Do not feel it was worth my money, Even though I got it during a sale. Even though this game came out two years ago, It still has great potential."

I'm also glad they are having it on a free weekend otherwsie I may not have tried it. Being on sale also it is definitely worth the $2.99usd I paid for it.Graphics wise, for the boxy voxel worlds of this style of game it does look nice, and definitely does the job.At my monitors max resolution of 1600x900 on a 1 gig Galaxy GTX 650 GC everything was sharp and clear with all the settings maxed and frame rate was excellent. If you like voxel type visuals then you'll definitely like how the game looks.Draw distance is good, with the ability to see opponents at great distances the game handles both short and long range distance combat well.I played on an Aussie server and the lag wasn't bad. The only lag I experienced was caused by people with marjorly high pings joining the game. So some local rate capped servers, even just one,  would be good, because when you are playing with locals all under 100 ping the game hardly lags at all. But that comes from other players not understanding how connection and distance works and how it causes rubber banding.Over all though plenty of server choice and it might just be the free weekend but it looks like a lot of people are playing it at the moment. Finding a match was easy and quick just a couple of clicks and you're in, no messing around.Any way, shooting people felt good over all. When I shot someone it felt like I shot them and being killed I never felt ripped off. Only time I had an issue was when shooting someone with a high ping and even then it didn't stop the game being fun.Classes don't seem too unbalanced and it was easy to switch between each one and no one class seemed to over power another. The game does have a few game mode types but Combat is the typical my team with guns against your team of guns action FPS similar to CoD and BF but with some minecraft style building options available.The building side is nice and adds a level of fun to the game but the problem is the building side isn't essential to game play.As players seem to be more focused on combat in public servers the building part seems superficial. I think to make the most of it you'd need to play with a group of like minded friends and make games of your own for long drawn out battles.Over all for the price it's a good shooter and you could easily spend more on the same with a different skin.If you like Halo, BF, CoD and minecraft like shenanigans then it's definitely worth picking up if you can get it cheap."

,Not Recommended,224540,11076078,"Posted: 4 July, 2014",all,🌺🌸Futome🌸🌺,"This is a title where if I could have it ripped off of my account, I would.I absolutely despise this game.Ace of Spades: Battle Builder is a first-person shooter game with a mechanic that allows for adapting to constantly changing environments. The entire map can be destroyed and the player can also build upon the map with individual cube blocks and pre-made designs that vary from class to class.Ignoring that this game is basically a first-person-shooter type game mixed together with minecraft building elements in a fairly poor fashion. It's not too bad, but the design could be improved upon other than seemingly relying on the hype of minecraft ideas and poorly tossing guns and god-awful mechanics into a game and then marketing it.AoS:BB (originally just Ace of Spades before being bought by Jagex) I find to be a broken, unbalanced mess. I speak for a general public game and not actual private, team-based combat. General public games are a complete disaster. They have absolutely no spawn-protection to speak of, or at least so little of one I couldn't tell there was one even there. Where your team can get camped worse than people staking outside of a videogame store for a console or game release. This is heavily built upon a huge issue of snipers in this game. Snipers can dig themselves deep inside mountains, hide well in the environment, and quickly change locations to be particularly hard to kill. Also an added fact that they can snipe you still outside the max FoV (field of View). So you literally can actually not even be able to see them, unless they have a nice little laser reticle aimed at your head. Which by the way, this games hitbox on each persons head is absolutely ridiculous. I made a video critizing this product and pointing out during my video for my watcher to observe the kill-feed and see that almost every kill in this game tends to be a headshot. Which of course, anyone familiar with the FPS-scene knows that bullets that hit the head generally do critical amounts of damage. Which makes someone who may need a handful of bullets to kill, only need 1 to 4 at most.The game has four classes, Marksman (Sniper), Commando (Heavy Weapons Guy), Rocketeer, and the Mechanic.Starting with the Commando, the commando has a minigun, grenades, a rocket launcher, and I believe a pickaxe. The commando isn't really that bad of a choice, though that being said, it's either him or the marksman if you're trying to play seriously. The other two classes in my opinion are a joke.The Minigun is slow to start and once it gets going it does a slew of damage and it takes out targets fairly quickly and in a reasonable matter. Because the games ever-shifting environment allows you to dodge that damage and figure ways to get out of that mess, it's pretty fair. His grenades are a joke and you'll only be using them to destroy the environment as players can easily avoid the grenades small radius. The rocket launcher is a great weapon but isn't really fair. Since one of the important aspects of this game is to take your enemies by-surprise to take them out since dying is pretty easy. That said, you cannot dodge the Rocket Launcher at point-blank. Therefore you will die and you couldn't do anything to avoid it. Unless your enemy is shooting those things from a distance, then you have an ample amount of time to dodge. Since dodging them is fairly easy and they move at a fair steady pace.As a note. It's because the battlefield is constantly changing, it's very easy to surprise-attack enemies since there's nooks and crannies everywhere.The Marksman uses a Sniper Rifle which one hit kills anyone if shot by the head. Which as I said. With the gigantic head hitboxes, is so easy that someone learning how to use the mouse will get rewarding shots like that consistently. The sniper also has the pistol which is generally a very balanced simple weapon only he can use I think, that it takes roughly 4-6 shots to the head with it and your enemy is toast (if they have 75%-100% health). The sniper uses a pickaxe.The Rocketeer is a joke of a class and is in alpha-stage of it's design for how poorly it operates compared to other classes.The Rocketeer uses a machinegun that does poor damage and has absolutely ridiculous recoil and is very innaccurate.His rocketpack has little fuel and takes a considerably long amount of time to refuel. His rocketpack also shaves off roughly 15% of all fuel on-startup each hold. It goes up almost entirely vertically and covers relatively no distance horizontally which is illogical. There's no point to using this function unless you just want to get over a mountain quickly. He also has a gun that shoots blocks out to help make staircases and pathes for teammates. However, it's so badly designed and inaccurate even in close quarters to its target, there's no sense in using it. His only helpful tool is his sentry gun.Though of course the sentry gun only does damage to those in proximity and doesn't deal punishing damage. So it's easy for others to immediately see it and dodge it while having relatively no hp loss. Also snipers will take them out in 1-2 bullets. And there's usually 3-5 players playing sniper a team generally.Then we have the Miner, who has a shotgun, a drill, a shovel, and some dynamite.The shotgun is not very effective at all as it has very high spread and the time between shots is so long that your opponent can quickly kill you while you're loading the next shot. The drill is an incredibly fun tool which digs GIGANTIC holes wherever you shoot it and it blows up at the end of it's course. This tool is insanely fun and incredibly satisfying to use, also particularly helpful too.His dynamite is boring and it isn't nearly as helpful in destructive damage like the drill. Destroys very little and it's really just a lame equipment slot gimmick.His shovel digs giant holes at a slower rate than the pickaxe. Also the shovel outdoes anything dynamite can do in just a few relatively moderate-speed swings.That's all the classes. I forgot to mention that they all have a few more equipment choices outside the preset ones. But they're literally all so awful that the only choices you'll ever take is the other sniper rifle for marksman and the other shotgun for Miner.The games maps are inspirative and fun and interesting to play on. That is, without the other players blowing them apart. You'll usually have people who's only goal each game is to destroy everything and so boring and dull that the color grey seems like it's as vibrant as the rainbow.Then there's just simply you not having fun, because you can't do anything or enjoy the map because there's nothing but snipers everywhere causing you to be constantly in scaves and narrow passages and nooks an crannies. Or simply just out getting your head scoped-off on the battfield constantly. And I hate that. I've seen amazingly built maps that do nothing but pique my interest to play on and explore, to be ruined by snipers consistenly killing me and other players decimating the entire map.Anywho, this review is getting rather lengthy. So lemme just quickly wrap it up with my quick summary of the game modes.Team Deathmatch: Campers everywhere, complete map destruction, not very fun.Zombies: Boring. You wander around somewhat aimlessly looking for humans and then you get quickly put out of your misery for a result.Capture the Flag: Whichever team spawn camps the best to win, wins.Base Destruction: I find this mode kind of fun, but ultimately no one every really bothers to really protect the main base (or play this gamemode for that matter.), so ultimately it gets destroyed quickly by a miner.Excavation: Snipers camp the drop-off zone and kill you and have an ally pick up the diamond you were carrying and easily just toss it into the drop-off zone and have an easy point.This game is terrible. Do not buy this game."

There are interesting and fun modes that utilize the brick building and destruction part of the game. There are different classes depending on your play style and it gives you alternate way to play.All in all, a nice time pass if you want some fun game mode and like to get side tracked for no reason by building a fort or maybe blow up someone elses fort."

Given the tag line ""Battle Builder"" this could do with being addressed.There are a lot of complaints on reviews about the classes, but mostly the classes are quite well balanced, even though their strengths and weeknesses are quite different from one another.There are also complaints about spawn points etc, the problem is that some of the maps are pretty bad, my advice there is use better maps. Also use more of the game modes - don't just stick to Team Deathmatch.****"

Much like minecraft this is a sandbox interactive Game however with teams and weapons. Sadly there was no singleplayer setting. but its understandable considering how Sandbox brings into that subject. its a Okay game i guess and they could have put more effort into it cause as soon as i started playing. within seconds i was dying over and over by Snipers. Ace of spades this game is called and it truly catches the games abouts. In conclusion its a okay game not bad not great Just okay.

Worth it.Just to clear this up to many people:This is not the original Ace of Spades. The original is called Build and Shoot. This Ace of Spades: Battle Builder is made by Jagex, not the original creators of Ace of Spades (AOS).This new AOS: Battle Builder is still fun, and although the classic they've added to AOS: Battle Builder is not like the original AOS, it's still very fun. So do not buy this expecting some huge Build and Shoot upgrade (An upgrade from the original AOS). It still is better than Build and Shoot in my opinion, but if you want the original AOS, look up ""Build and Shoot"" and you'll find it!Note: I'm not paid, if you think so, then good for you, I don't care, personally!"

Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes.

Enemy spawns are easily reached in the small, poorly designed maps. Spawn camping is very common, just wait for the spawn protection to wear off and then take them out before they find you which with the ability to build a fort around yourself makes things all the more easy to camp.Due to the block-y Minecraft style character design it is very easy to hit your enemies and headshots are a dime a dozen. On my first (and last) time of playing I was accused of hacking because of how many headshots I was getting, maybe I'm just used to games that don't punish the player with poor character and level design.Minecraft with guns just doesn't work.

Unfortunately, that first impression is correct.  The game takes an excellent concept piece, one still fully playable as 'Build and Shoot' online, and makes it meaningless by attempting to radically increase the pace.  Instead of a functional if slightly featureless WWI game with building blocks (leading to exciting dynamics emphasising patience, careful basebuilding, and long-distance accuracy along with the occasional high-stress trench assault), the new developers attempted to create a game with the speed of Team Fortress 2 with building blocks.  Inevitably, this makes it too fast for the blocks to be any use (the addition of a jetpack and variety of explosives don't help) and too clunky for patience to be important.That, combined with my multiple connection issues and latency problems on a pc with adequate hardware and excellent internet leads me to think you should avoid it."

They forgot that rocketeers can be, sniped out of the sky, land on a land mine, be taken down with rockets, nearly instantly killed by a miner's shotgun, etc. For some reason Jagex listened to these people. Now, instead of a rocketeer, one of the few classes who could sneak up on snipers and take them out, was replaced with the ""engineer"". Some might say that the engineer still has a jetpack but it is severely nerfed and doesn't allow the engineer to make from side to side, only upwards. The engineer is a pointless class and every server is filled with snipers and simply stepping outside of spawn will get you sniped. Do not buy this game. I made that mistake and wasted $15."

It's like Battlefeild, Call of Duty, or as I often compare it with, Team Fortress 2. Think of it as the building ideas from Minecraft. The map is made out of blocks, and it's an online multiplayer FPS game. It has four classes as I know. Them being the Commando, the Marksman, the Engineer and the Miner. The Commando is often equiped with a RPG and a Mini Gun, usefull for raiding a base or defending yourself in Zombie mode. The Marksman is my favourite though, equiped with (Of Course!) a Sniper Rifle, and a pistol. This is great for stealth, especially with you create a base at the top of a large building (Such as Big Ben), and owning everyone before they can even make it to your team mates. It isn't the most usefull in zombie mode though, unless your on a large tower, in that case it's very usefull, but you'll have to act fast or a load of Zombies will tear it down. The Engineer has an assult rifel. But he often would use a jetpack for getting around. But he is not to usefull and will often be found useless due to only really having is weak Assult Rifle. Thought in Zombie mode it shines as getting up tall buildings and protecting it self from Zombies. There have only been about 5 times i've been able to kill a Engineer as a Zombie due to it turning around noticing I'm charging at with full speed, and all he does is shoot at me for 1 second, and he owned me! And last, but not least, the Miner. This is the Zombie survival beast! He'll often be shooting you with his shotgun, and killing you in two or one hits. Or he'll just shoot you with deadly mining gun which is used to dig holes. He'll often be one of the last survivers in the Zombie round, only because he was hiding underground, often with some other person to protect him and wait for everyone two realise he was underground. There are also many different sort of rounds you can play in. Like Team Fortress 2 you got pleanty of different rounds to choose from. Only in Ace of Spades, there different. In Team Fortress 2, the fun in that was killing the others with the different classes. You know, blasting peoples guts out with the Heavy, blowing people up with the Demoman, burning people to crisp with the Pyro, sniping enemies as the Sniper and even backstabbing others as a Spy. As fun as that sounds (depending on your personallity), it doesn't mach up to Ace of Spades, you see in Ace of Spades you'll often be ACCTUALLY be doing your mission. And yes in Team Deathmach your goal is to kill as many players as you can on the other team, which is my favourite type of match. But in other missions such as Diamond Mine, you acctually try to get that diamond and get it back to your base. There are other missions such as Capture The Flag, Occupation, VIP, but the two rounds that stand out the most to me are Team Deathmatch and Zombie Mode. In Team Deathmatch your goal is simple as the title, kill as many as the other players on the enemy team, and the team with the most kills wins. And course the consept of making a structure such as a bridge, a sniping tower or simpily block by block is super usefull. And at the end of a match you get to see a picture of the acctual map, and a picture of what it is when you finnished, and it's fun to see the destruction and objects you placed on the map. On Zombie mode you must build your self protection in only a minute from the zombie, but you may be randomly picked to be a zombie and try and kill all the others, one a human has been killed it turns into a Zombie too, and there is no reversing it. The only way you will survive to the end is get in a group of people and defend yourselves. Zombies also have the power of running fast, very fast. Zombies can destroy up to 10 blocks at a time. The idea of a zombie is that it is a rufless killer who will do anything to get to you. It will smash walls to get to you, so kill Zombies who may be getting close to you fast. In the first 5 minutes of the round you won't often get attacked by a Zombie if your base was cleverly built in a safe place, but then there's more! The more zombies there are the more your going to get noticed, and when you and your team mates are all in the same place, all the other players (as Zombies) with demolish your base until the get there claws on you and you become one as well! That's something you need to think about too. Try and make your base on a large building other than a very thin one all they will thear it down from the bottom, like a chainsaw cutting a tree. In terms of Graphics and gameplay it's in median condition. The gameplay is fun and interesting, but will often be disruped by lagging (at the first 2 minutes of the game), bugs such as randomly not being able to move from a block for about 30 seconds, and just crashing because it lost connection from Steam for some reason. Other than that it's still incredibly fun. In terms of graphics, you get what you see! But the retro style graphics are similar to Minecraft's graphics, and it wouldn't have the same experiance with realistic grapincs.So overall, I reccomend this to FPS fans, and if your new to MMOs, the this is a good game to start with. This is a game for those people that were playing Call of Duty and thinking 'Man! I could really use a structure here'. Or someone who's playing Minecraft and thinking 'Dude! I wish there were guns in this game and it didn't have such a dull feel to it'.So I give this game a 7/10Your more than likely to enjoy it and not getting annoyed by bugs, you'll love it!"

I didn't play much of it at the time, as I wanted to use the Marksman to help my team from a distance, but he was a terrible character. I then did not play it at all for three or four years. I have started to get back in to it, but a lot has changed.First of all, there was a DLC called ""Valentine's Day Massacre"" released for five dollars. There were two game modes specific to the DLC, and two maps specific to those gamemodes, and a character, the Gangster, that you were forced to play as for the modes. The only problem with this is that it was later assimilated into the main game as a content patch, with the buyers of the DLC getting no reimbursal or reward, meaning they wasted five dollars.The controls actually work great, though I suffer from lag problems at times, making it hard to survive.Now the worst part, and I will try to be brief. The balancing and community. Apparently, over those years I was away, the community devolved into whiny children who try to kick you for beating them, and hackers, two of which I have reported, and they pointed me towww.[REDACTED].net. Not good. Very few people actually play the game for the game any more.Remember how I said the Marksman was bad? Not any more. Apparently everyone has started using them and finding the most cheap strategies to win. It has devolved into a contest of getting the most Marksmen, and getting them the most sniper sits in the shortest time. The team that does that, essentially, figuratively, and literally, wins. It has ruined the game, leading the way for hackers and whiners to take over the community.As much as I liked the game, I cannot recommend it with these problems. It hurts me to do this, but I would give it a final score of:2/10"

If you make a game that is about two things, namely, shooting people in the face and building, you cannot add a mechanic that completly removes one of those things from the equasion.Ace of Spades had brilliant building and destruction mechanics. But no-one cares, because ther is no point to build anything. One class gets a jet-pack, and can fly over your beautifuly crafted fortress walls. All the primary modes have unique classes that are completly over-the-top and fun to play, but so does Team Fortress. You can blow holes in things, but its a waste of ammo and time when you can just jet over it.However, ther is ONE MODE that gets it right: Classic CTF. Every player gets the same class, with either a scopeless sniper rifle, a assualt-style SMG, or a ungodly powerful close-quarters shotgun. They also get two grenades, a shovel, and the ability to build. No drill-rocket launchers, no autoturrets, and no jetpacks.It is the most amazing and unique experience I have ever played in a shooter. There is a kind of authesticity to rushing over an open killing ground and despratly trying to dig a foxhole to escape the next wave of rifle-fire, and assualting into a base by diving into trenches. Or as you sneak around to the fortress thy built around their flag, poke a hole in the wall, toss a grenade in and breaching through the resulting hole. The vanilla rifle is extremly satisfying to use and promotes careful, strtegic positioning, while the shotgun is the most fun shock-and-awe weapon I have ever encountered, able to blow a man-sized hole in a thin wall with a single shot. With a good team, you will build a massive fortress with logical defenses and killzones, all while driving to breach the enemy who does the same.The problem, is that nobody plays Classic. The mirad of other modes with their fun-and-silly classes distract from the real meat of the game: digging, building and shooting people in the face.Now it's just shooting people in the face. Like every other FPS out there.Only with really terrible graphics and lots of crashes."

It's been a while since I've played, so I don't know how much has changed, but I've had a lot of fun with it.  There are time when the game can make you mad.  Mostly this is due to other players either griefing or all around not playing the game correctly.  But that is the chance you take when you play with other people.  The Kick system is both good and bad.  I've been kicked for no reason before as I'm sure you will be too, eventually.  If you like a quick FPS game with little thought required than you'll like this game.  It's fun being able to destroy everything and build anything.  If you can get in a game with cool people who are all interested in playing the game it can be a blast.  I do remember having some issues logging onto their servers at times.  I don't know if that is fixed or not.  Overall if you can get the game on the Cheap and you’re not looking for a deep experience, just some good old shooting, environment destroying fun, than give this game a try."

I cant emphasize how bad it is.  All people do is snipe.  even close range,  they will close range snipe you in the face, it is completely ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.  The Mayan Jungle is one of the coolest maps, but one of the frickin worst maps, because the two times I played on that map people just got up on the edge and sniped down into the jungle, that is no fun at all.  Another time someone literall built a bridge out over the jungle and just sat on the bridge sniping.  That sucks the fun out of the game when thats all people do."

This game had potential but after playing it after its ""beta"" stages it really has turned into a drag. This astonishes me because of how fun and to be honest well designed the classic version was. When this game was in its beta stages it was surprisingly fun but now I don't know what to say it's as if someone destroyed what was almost perfect. Well I might as well begin with the games shortcommings. First off this game has the absolute most stale movement and shooting I have ever seen! I don't know what Jagex was on when they thought that shooting should be a still motion with absolutley no power behind it. This game does not emulate good shooting period it's stiff, unnatural, and all around not very interesting. Now on to the next subject, The gamemodes. None of them seem to be very interesting to me some like Classic CTF seemed good on paper but are just a gimped version of the classic versoin where everyone cheats and you only have one gun the rifle. The zombie mode is not much better again it sounds good on paper but in the game it turns into a game of one man on a tower and zombies piled below them not very interesting. And lastly there is the servers and stability. This game has some of the absolute worst online experience I've ever used in any game! This might just be an issue on my end but more times than I can count I've been on official servers where everyone has a 200+ ping and people are lagging around killing people with what feels like hacking. There are servers where you can't even move it's so bad and thats not even getting into the enourmous amounts of rubber banding that goes on with latency. All and all it's like I said a painfully average shooter with a building element strapped on to sell copies I would highly request you save your money and play the much better free BuildAndShoot version of the game it's alot more interesting."

So here's my view/opinion on the game.It's simple, it's fun, but it's nothing special.Some of the gamemodes can be quite fun, and the destructible maps are pretty entertaining, though they sometimes end up leveled halfway through the match.The block building is also quite neat, and can be useful during battles.As for updates and new content, there's practly nothing other than one 'expansion' and workshop support for custom map sharing.The game is not worth the listed price in my opinion, as I said, if you want it, wait for a sale.If anything in this is wrong, please let me know."

Snipers have lasers that everyone can see now, which is stupid. There is little balance, which is stupid. The game (in comparision with the original), is stupid.LENGTH AND REPLAY VALUE = 2You'll find that more people play Build&Shoot (the old version) than the current version. This game has little value even to the fans of the original. At least it has workshop integration to make map-making a breeze (instead if the old method). They removed the scripting capabilities though. Why!? People could make whole game modes with scripts! New modes is what is keeping Build&Shoot (the original) alive! Again, this game has less weekly players than the original.GRAPHICS = 5The game has graphics that are similar to, but are more advanced and slightly pretty than the original.  But, you can find graphics that are a bit better in the OpenSpades client for the original.FRAME RATE = 5Unless you have a dedicated gaming rig, you will NEED to turn on the ""compatibility shader"" to get a decent frame rate. I didn't even notice the option. If it's so ""compatible"", why wasn't it turned on in the first place?CONTROLS = 6The controls are mostly the same as the original. Which means that it is flawed, but it's not awful. There is room for improvement.VALUE FOR MONEY = 1I'm sure someone could find value in this game, but I couldn't. Especially when the older version, which is more fun and has a better community (i.e. mostly not 12 year old Call of Duty no scopers), is FREE. There is no reason to pay US$15 when there's a superior game and superior community waiting for you for free.MUSIC AND SOUND = 2What happened, Jagex? The original had much better sound. For one thing there wasn't horrible, loud music in the title screen of the original.DLC / FREEMIUM / PAY2WIN = N/AThis game doesn't have a paid element (other than the $15 entry fee)ASSET FLIPPING = N/AThis game was made by Jagex. Jagex made Runescape. You can't possibly tell me that Jagex couldn't afford to make their own assets.OVERALL = 3.6I'd recommend the OpenSpades client for Build&Shoot instead. This is just bad. It doesn't even have the Babel game mode that's keeping the original alive."

From there, I dove in to the game itself.Knowing little about what to expect, and with a very fuzzy memory of the game-play from a few years ago, I decided to go ahead and join a random server. This turned out to be a very fast paced and fun zombie mode, where players begin as human, and attempt to survive against a growing horde of undead. This has been done plenty of times before, but I enjoyed the added lunacy of mutable environments. I spent a good deal of time trying to build a massive tower to protect myself from the dead, and was surprised when it came collapsing on itself, leading to brief violence and a quick transformation into a zombie.Playing as a zombie was a delight, and had a completely different feel and basic strategy, which I appreciated. All in all, the zombie mode provided solid, engaging and bizarre mindless fun. I could choose to strategically defend myself, run around like an idiot, or just dig a hole and cover myself with dirt, hoping that the undead didn't find me.I spent a lot of time digging holes in this game. Even in the engaging classic capture the flag mode. When I started playing capture the flag, I was a bit worried, as the server was more quiet, and clearly less chaotic. However, after finding my bearings, learning to follow the map, and getting into it, it felt a lot like playing capture the flag as a kid, only with bolt action rifles.The levels are huge, and the ability to dig and build allows a lot of opportunity for creative strategy and silly low cunning.The bottom line: This is the first game in my steam backlog that I'm happy to have purchased. It's the first that I will keep installed, and occasionally go back to as a silly time-waster. The low learning curve helped quite a bit, and I enjoyed the cutesy, retro-inspired graphical touches."

76561198043971033,Not Recommended,224540,16854906,"Posted: 2 July, 2015",all,Upsetti And No Spaghetti,"Ace of Spades is an online only voxel-built FPS with building and destruction of almost the entirety of all maps. It started as a slow paced, thoughtful, and well-mapped free webgame before it was picked up by Jagex and reworked. The original webgame was largely unfinished and somewhat lacking, but full of promise, so I was really excited for the full release by Jagex (a company I didn't know already had a bad rap before this game). I would wind up dissapointed. Ace of Spades: Battlebuilder (a subtitle they somehow added months after release) adds about as many new features as it breaks simple things.Ace of Spades: Battlebuilder has a handful of different gamemodes, both FPS staples and interesting new modes like a modified Oddball where you have to dig up and hold diamonds, and demolition where the goal is to destroy the enemy team's base while preserving your own. The different modes are welcome, but most go unplayed. Chances are that if you get in a non-TDM/CTF/zombie game, you'll only have 2 to 5 other people in your VIP/territory control/KOTH game.Beyond that, all the base game maps are either too small for large numbers of players to reasonably have fun and not die every 15 seconds, or they're so big that everyone gives up playing in frustation at being crossmapped by snipers and not finding anything much to do on the map. It's strange that so many maps get the pacing wrong and that the game doesn't have a matchmaking system to get good amounts of people together. Even the map editor doesn't help much because only custom servers run them, and they are often private or also near empty. So finding good maps and servers in this game is really difficult.So let's say you were to get in a game and start playing. You're presented with 4 classes unless you're in a special game mode such as zombie, VIP, or the half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥classic. Honestly, the classes were never balanced, and every once in a while when I checked in they'd be offbalanced in some other way. The miner is poor at everything except creating holes, tunnels, and collapsing enemy structures. They have no fighting chance except to drop a platform out from somebody high up or shoot 2 blocks in front of them with the shotgun. The commando is an 80's action movie hero who packs a minigun and an RPG, and you are useless for anything except spamming shots everywhere. There is no way to carefully play a commando-you hope for the best as you rush into the fight to probably be picked off. Then there's the engineer. The engineer has a jump pack which allows him to soar all over the map, an SMG which is surprisingly accurate and damaging, a block cannon to build bridges and things from a range, and deployable sentries. The engineer is a popular class because they are fast, manueverable, and surprisingly lethal. I believe they also have a super damaging melee. Then there's the marksman who is also crazy fast, low profile, and lethal. Marksmen can kill in a couple bodyshots, fire rapidly with one rifle, and have no recoil. In addition they are hard to touch because of their good building prefabs and mines. So, most games devolve into COD-like matches where everyone either zooms around on crack with an OP SMG or they hide in corners just racking up kills and freaking out when they're finally successfully found and killed. Team work is so rare in this game, and there usually isn't a good way to help a teammate out besides helping shoot enemies.If you manage to find a good server and start having fun with a class you're still at risk of the game failing you. There are a lot of bugs and crashes. I remember teams incorrectly balancing, falling through the sky box, being unable to heal at spawn (there's a tent which is supposed to heal you), and fatal crashes to desktop to name a few. I really wish I could recommend this game, but I cannot. Jagex made too many mistakes, and everyone with the game suffers for it. 5/10 because it can be a couple hours of simple fun when the stars align. I suggest finding another FPS."

It is now obviously geared torwards little kids, whereas it used to be fun for all ages. In every way this game has been made to take away the advantage of experience, essentially making it impossible to get ""good"" at it. The building aspect looks novel, but you will rarely use it in actual gameplay. They have taken away several features that once made this game good, either removing them or completely nerfing them in failed attempts to make the game less frustrating to those who are new to it. For example, they added a visible laser beam extending from sniper rifles, so that all other players can locate the sniper. Also, an extremely annoying swear filter has been added to chat, and weapons have been given ridiculous range (although not accuracy). Basically, you can just pick up a minigun and spray torwards any snipers on the map (that you can easily see), most likely getting a headshot, and all you will see in chat is ""**** you ************."" In addition, this game has a ridicuously small draw distance, so that the kids on their cheap laptops are not disadvantaged. Also, most of the servers are extremely slow, like the developers wrote bad code or aren't paying for decent machines. Don't anticipate a fast connection. There are many more ways this game is horrible, but the bottom line is not to buy it if you are over the age of 5 and expect decent gameplay."

Whereas with a normal FPS the map you play on is the map you play on and get to know. With ace of spades it is different. by the end of a match in whatever gamemode the map the game finishes on is radicallyh different to the map you began on. No two games are the same. One player can really make a huge difference to the way everyone else has to play as they alter the terrain to give advantages to aliies and disadvantages to enemies.I won't list here all the different game modes but i can tell you now that there are many- and most of them are pretty good in my opinion.  I start a game of classic capture the flag and when i look at my watch 3 hours has passed and i just sit there. wondering where the time went.There are only two criticisms i have towards this game. The first is that if you're ping goes above 100 the game becomes very hard to play; above 150 and it's practically unplayable due to horrendous lag ( not a problem if you have decent internet). My second criticism is that the devs have pretty much abandoned this game. The company is Jagex which is also the company that made runescape, a very popular MMO. the devs have invested all their time into runescaoe and left all their other games to slowly die.I picked this game up for £2 but this game is still definately worth the money at full price.

This is not a recommendation, this is a warning to stay away from this atrocious butchered dross at all costs. A pitiful attempt at trying to appeal to a number of core FPS demographis its style, tone and gameplay, simply can't hope to overlap. While at the same time both looking and running terribly on the very low-end PCs of the original userbase it appealed to, (how you can make blocky voxel graphics look even *worse* than the beta is a remarkable feat in itself)This is of course not the Ace of Spades people heard of and discussed wildly in indie-circles, no sir, this is a man's Ace of Spades, made by Jaqex, (your friendly neighborhood developer/publicher of RuneScape Browser MMO fame) and it shows! By which I mean it's so utterly bland and generic, desperately hacking together pieces of other and better games and popcultural references in order to appeal to as many demographics at once. While failing to satisfy anyone (besides maybe falling-sand game enthusiasts) A game designed by committee... Of marketers and executives.The potential for fun is in there somewhere, but it's hampered by its schizophrenic tone and often completely contradictionary game mechanics. Compounded by a uncaring to downright malicious development team, (Though I say that loosely, more likely that the developers hands are thouroughly tied in the matter and whatever the bossman says goes.)This isn't saying much of course, - I've always held that Ace of Spades was to modern FPSs what a cardboard cigar is to a terminal nicotine addict, but it was accessible, simple and would run on my intermittedly spotty connection without a care in the world and if you got nothing else, it was worth wasting a few hours on. - This ""fast paced reimagining"" at least lives up to its new ideals, after 17 minutes I was so thouroughly sick of it I think I'll never boot it up again.Thankfully the community picked up the pieces... Not that Jaqex would ever admit it. Cowards.2 out of 10,  ""Please keep your executives out of the development and community management processes next time."""

I played it before it had the 'battle builder' tag on it, when it was on a free weekend. And let me tell you, that was fun. I'm not a fps fan but AoS was really really... fun.The dev teamed also released a dlc? I'm not sure what they wanted to do with it but the dlc just introduced a small amount of new maps and servers that was only available to people who owned the dlc. Which is all well and good, if you have a playerbase. In AoS's case, they had no one. And the consumers who bought the dlc had no one to play with.But after the weekend, the population died down massively. There was only about one or two full servers and the only mode played was zombie mode. Which, imo, was boring as hell. Then, they decided to release the game as a 'sandbox' game, where you could build your own maps. Trying to save a dying game, I suspect.So, I do not recommend this game at all until the playerbase has grown. Which requires people to play the game, which requires people to buy the game.

While humans recieve many nutrients from outside sources, such as light from our nearest star, the vast majority of the energy that powers bodily functions required for life is provided by food. Food is a general word for anything consumed via the mouth for energy, which is measured in Calories, a unit consisting of 1000 calories with a lowercase c. When foods are consumed, the body breaks them down into a number of base substances which are melted down via stomach acid and absorbed via the stomach and upper intestinal tract. Over the course of digestion, which is the breaking down and total absorption of all these substances, a bacterially enriched waste is left behind primarily consisting of fiber that we refer to as Ace of Spades. There is no exact indication of when food is rendered as Ace of Spades, however, and this phrase primarily refers to the waste once it has reached the large intestine. The large intestine continues to absorb water from Ace of Spades, leaving a semi-solid brown lump of undigested fiber and other waste moving through the colon. Finally, Ace of Spades passes through a door known to biologists as the sphincter, which signals its exit from the body. There are many ways to dispose of Ace of Spades after it is removed from the body, and different methods with associated health benefits and detriments are also associated with specific global cultures. While I can't comment on the best method for relieving oneself of Ace of Spades: Battle Builder, I can at least reply with my own method of disposal, a simple and quick uninstallation of Ace of Spades from my body whilst seated."

Instead, however the game degenerated to a glorified COD remake filled with trolls looking to destroy any attempts at creating a base for your team, and maps that pretty much had a base built for you anyway. Even the maps with no basic foundations just end up as an open field with little opportunity to build as the enemy just rushes you with rifles. It's hard to justify a game where some of it's main selling points are pointless in the main game, the community is just full of people with insane superiority complexes, and where no one is willing to actually work together. When the game works it can be fantastic, but there really  wasn't much that the devs did to make sure that building was useful, and not just something you did just to create a premade building."

First: Almost no one is ever online anymore. That kind of thing really kills a online shooter really fast. Second: The classes are unbalanced. Games like these require all of the different classes to have their own ups and downs. But none of these classes have that balance. Basically the only class you want to play as in most of the game modes is the Marksman, so whenever you're not playing as him, you get shot down in literally seconds, especially on maps with an easy-to-get-to campsite (which is all of them). Third: Some of the gamemodes don't work all that well. These gamemodes have an objective, and a time limit. The frequent frustration of the gamemodes, then, is being losing to the timelimit. Right before you get the objective in time to win, the timer goes off, and you lose. This generally discourages returning to these gamemodes."

This is a huge step from its free version a year back, before Jagex got their hands on it. I remember the hax and being able to shoot rockets and throw hundreds of grenades from the sky. I wouldn't have bought the game given the known quality of it. Some of its game modes are interesting, such zombies and demoliton. The team deathmatches, I don't like. Point capture can be fun at times though. You only get 4 people to play, the ones showed on the trailer. The miner is my favorite.

Eveyone just goes sniper and when I say everyone, i mean EVERYONE. If you have this game and play it right now, you will immedeately notice that there are nothing but empty servers. When you do join one, everyones a sniper and there might be like 1 miner or commando. I recommend it, but don't expect to have large chaotic battles with explosions and all hell breaking loose very often like when the game first came out. You'll probably see nothing but sniper nests and headshots galore from snipers, along with lasers from snipers and dying every 5 seconds from snipers. Did I mention theres snipers?"

Mainly because it wasn't really balanced and was just a game where most people played Commando and Rocketeer (which basically made this game a walking nade spam), the maps weren't really that suited for the gamemodes they were played on and the only thing that was at least half fun was the zombie mode, which was basically dominated by rocketeers which used the long range jetpack. Also, which kind of♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥made the classic mode in this game? Even though it was basically a crippled version of the ""old game"" it was still better than playing anything other than zombies, and even zombies was better in the old game.So do yourself a favor and don't buy this, because I can't forgive myself having wasted money on this.Also the alpha is still playable with updated graphics and under a new namehttp://buildandshoot.com"

I loved the simplicity, and everything seemed pretty balanced. The digging and building aspect was extremely useful. In fear of getting gunned down by a SMG wielding maniac? Build a small fortification. Got a short ranged weapon? Tunnel behind them. Want to protect your base? Build some fortifications to slow the enemy down. Lots of good stuff that kept everyone guessing and generally having a good time.Then jetpacks happened.So now, building defences is practically usless when some guy can just use a class with a in-built fly hack. As much as I love some of the new features, and gamemodes like classic CTF, which brings back all that was good about the original, and more, this game just lacks the smoothness of generic shooters and the quirkyness of lesser known titles such as the old voxel shooter this game emerged from. It makes me feel like it has no idea what it wants to be.TL;DR: I'm afraid I can't reccomend this product at full price, seeing as the old version still exists under a different name and still has a fairly active community. However, I wouldn't totally rule it out if it's on sale and you have a few spare bucks. It can be fun, but it's got quite a few problems.I hope this review is helpful to any looking at buying this title."

If you can get it on sale 50-75% off, that's a much more realistic price range for what you're getting.The original Ace of Spades was very much focused on team base building but everything in this AOS is pretty much already built for you and all you can realistically create are minimal pre-fab structures.  Jagex has also tacked on a bunch of DLC to this game, which to be honest isn't worth it and at the same time limits your options in-game as well.The building in the original game was really the main selling point.  In a deathmatch or CTF game, both sides would rapidly build up forts and towers to defend their base, while holding back the enemy.  Meanwhile, other players might take a jog around the map to try and flank enemy positions and others would attempt to tunnel underneath or past the enemy base or straight to their intel case (the flag).  The maps were massively larger as well.  None of that charm is in this game.I would instead highly recommend playing the original game...first at least.

Any Sniper built a sniping outpost just get your minigun and destroy it all!Enemy flag too held up in fire? Build a tonel under it mine up and you have the flag the destruction in this game is too good!The Zombie mode is epic where its last man alive but jetpakc guys do rule the gamemode.But The Servers can be sometimes not full depending on where you are in the world  and i would say the best time to play game is mid day because thats when most playes  are on (atleast is uk) and like 5 maps are sniper dominated and no create a class *ATM*Summary? a good game where you can blow the sh*t out of the enemies and there bases with strategy thinking (even though blow the sh*t out of everything is high in game) if its ever on sale you need to get."

,Recommended,224540,13823793,"Posted: 3 January, 2015",all,Wiggycat314,"I found this game back in 2011 when it was still in beta.  At first, I thought it was a rip off of minecraft, but after hours of playing it, I found that I was playing it more than minecraft.  Eventually I stopped playing AoS and forgot about the game.  However, last year I found it again here on steam and I immediately bought the game.  I was surprised to see that the game had gotten a big haul in new content.  New gamemodes, new maps, new weapons, and new playable characters.  I had no outside opinions of it other than my own, due to the fact that I'm really the only one of my friends that has ever had an interest in this game, so I liked the new changes.  I tried all the gamemodes and I liked almost all of them.  However, I usually spent most of my time on team deathmatch or classic ctf.  Had I written this review a few months ago, I would say that the game is a bit unbalanced, but with the update in October, it's much better.  I find that massive spawn camping to the point where your entire spawn area is 20 blocks below the map has not happened anymore.  Also, with the marksman class having much lower ammo, they aren't as op anymore.  It's still an overused class though.Bottom line is, for those who like the new content, they can play the new content.  For those who don't like the new content and hate what this game has become, they can play classic ctf.  Add a few more maps to the game and I'd give it an 8.5/10"

For those who dont know this game used to be a Free to Play game that was modeled after World War 1 trench warfare with players bringing a trench gun, M1 Garand  or a bolt action sniper (hard to tell which one due to the voxel nature). These games could last like real life trench warfare engagements, as both teams bunkered down and prepared for the next assult. Now we have Ace of Spades: Battle Builder and i have to be honest, it took the guidelines of the origanal free to play version and added new mechanics to scrap them. Examples of this are the mass construction and mass destruction blue prints. While it made building faster, the risk to building in the orignal is that you would almost expose yourself to make your hold better, just asking for the sniper to shoot you in the head. Next is the time limit for the matches, why have long standoff engagements in attempt to flank your opposition when there is a 10 or 15 minute timer for the match, this not only killed the building aspect but ruined what made the orignal so good. lastly the classes, while they are intresting an unique they contadict what the game was based around. why build a wall if a miner can shoot a drill rocket at it or someone jetpacking over? Overall Jagex should have not shut down the orignal version of this game in place of this, the should of and at the time of writing this, make a new IP (Block N Load)  that gives and takes from what AoS had instead of steam rolling the old players out of the way."

Not to mention for the while it was up on the steam it was being sold for 19.99$, and they also sold dlc with that. Unfortuantlly I bought the DLC and the next day they unbelievablly made it free of charge for everyone who owns the game (Seeing as how very few people had bought it during the month it was up). The reviews on it were from two review sights i've never heard of and IGN. All of them are praising, the much bigger sights such as rock, paper, shotgun , though seems to dislike as much as myself.The game was a waste for everyone to buy ever since Jagex took a free-to-play title, slapped his logo on it and  figurativlly ♥♥♥♥♥ed on it. I'm quite peeved I ever paid more money on this than Bad Rats. I payed 25.00$ on this game just for everything to be notched down to a 15.00 $ for everything that used to be free. Everything they say in the game review is mostlly a lie, such as you can build things to change the battle field such as cover and use it to your advantage. Seeing as how every class is largelly underpowered except for the sniper, they made it were almost any weapon can blow through your cover with ease (Not to mention, A certain sniper rifle can pierce through blocks). Anyone who wishes to buy this, I plead for you not to. It is nothing more than a scam of a game using it's predecessors past glory to make an easy buck."

There are many modes to play in and my favourite is team deathmatch mode you have to get the most kills as a team before the timer runs out and whoever has the most kills on their team you win.It is very easy to play and you can change the lag in the settings by setting the graphics much lower to stop the lag.

The concept is a nice spin on Team Fortress + Minecraft with a decent selection of game modes available to keep things fresh, the only real downside is if you're playing certain modes with a team that isn't coordinating versus a team that is, the match can be over before it even has a chance to get going.  The building mechanics are probably the weakest link when it comes to actual gameplay (aside from the slighthly iffy weapon aiming) but I don't really think there would be a more elegant way to try to pull off what they're trying to do.

The gameplay is really quite well balenced. This isnt ""minecraft with guns"". It really is its own game with its own feel.There is class based combat(not including classic mode), where different classes have different levels of ability in 3 main areas. Combat, rate of digg/destroying blocks, and building things.Every class can do all those things but each has its specialty. Conventional fps modes like CTF and Deathmatch take on a whole new strategic and fun quality when these things are added into the mix."

Me being one of the many people that enjoyed playing countless hours of the beta (which wasn't on Steam) a few years ago, I decided to buy the new Steam version. Let me be straight forward when I say this. It is NOTHING like the beta. Pretty much everything has changed to the point that it's hard to believe that the beta was even for this game. To be completely honest, I think that the beta was better. Jagex being the company that has taken over the production of this game (with their not particularly good reputation) has turned this game around for what in my opinion is for the worse. Every update besides its level creator ends up being horrible and constantly makes the game even worse than what it already is. Then again.....from another persons stand point.....Jagex's production of this game could have been a good thing. Let's see, about everything that many people as well as me would complain about is a good thing according to other people. There are two kinds of players on this game. The type that are starting discussions saying that they want their money back (psh that's never going to happen haha), and the type starting discussions that are asking if they are the only people out there that actually like the game. I think that this game is a hit or miss that depends only on the player. Either you'll enjoy this game or hate it, both options of which have reasons that are completely understandable. I don't think that this game should be hated on nor should it be praised. Even though it could be alot worse, it could be alot better too. There are many areas for improvements. Don't get me wrong, this game is not bad. It's just not the best. I prefer the beta version, but hey. If you agree with me on that, at least someone released a free game of the beta that is polished and improved. It's called Open Spades(https://sites.google.com/a/yvt.jp/openspades/home). If you think about it, you could own Ace of Spades on Steam and the old beta version off of the internet if you wanted to. Then you'd be able to try out both. I think that Ace of Spades is a good game. Yes it has flaws, but I don't agree with the people that are saying that Jagex ruined it. It's completely different, yes, at the same time though it's a fresh new experience that leaves the player wanting to play once again. I still recommend this game even though I have some problems with it.Pros: New features, enjoyable, and updates that help keep things in balance.Cons: Gets old fairly quickly, Classic mode fails to give out an idea of what the beta was like, and some things in-game end up making gameplay less enjoyable. Those updates.....SOILED IT.Could be alot better. 6/10"

The game is a cliche'd mix of ""Minecraft meets Call of Duty hurr durr"" but it has some unique points that make it fun and interesting. First off, there's about 8 - 10 maps developed, each gigantic and with massive amounts of detail. Theres about 5 various gamemodes, the ones I mostly enjoy are CTF and Zombie-mode. No PvE. You kill people, mine blocks and then use said blocks to build your own blocks and structures. The building aspect isn't very useful as everything gets blown up in one shot, hell if you die you explode and destroy whatever you were standing on anyway. The destruction aspect is mostly emphasized. The game is still undergoing heavy development and balancing, but I would say this game is a definate buy at $10 and a possibile buy at $15.

,Not Recommended,224540,13109966,"Posted: 27 November, 2014",all,Omen267901,"This game is absolutely terrible. It's as simple as that. This game is a remake of the original Ace of Spades made by indie dev Ben Aksoy. The original game before Jagex bought it was a tactical trench-warfare Voxel based FPS. However, early in development, Jagex bought the license from him in secret and told him to continue development. However, they forced him to add things no one in the community wanted like an SMG (Which completely broke game balance), a shotgun, infinite sprint, auto-climbing, and 1 extra grenade (sounds minor, but made bunkers almost worthless)Eventually, they forced him to cancel development so that they could make their own version of the game, which is what this review is for.Pros of the remake+Better graphics~Had a larger community, but doesn't anymore.Cons-Horrible optimization (Tried this game on 4-5 different computers, all capable of running Skyrim on at least medium at 80 FPS, and it still ran lke♥♥♥♥♥♥on all of them, staying consistently below 30.)-Badly balanced classes (At first Sniper was OP and wrecked everything, and now it is literally a death sentance and the Miner and Commando destroy everything (literally for miner)-Building is pointless (Anything you build can be destroyed in seconds by the miner. It's as simple as that)-Hackers, trolls, and griefers everywhere. (almost no Anti-cheat exists, and it's almost impossible to play sometimes because there are so many hackers. Trolls run around teamkilling everyone and building phallic structures, and griefers destroy anything you build making it even more pointless.-Lack of updates (Took almost 2 years for an update that was supposed to take a week. Enough said)-Bugs everywhere (floating blocks, shooting through walls [not by hacking, there is a glitch where you can shoot people, and hit them with melee through walls very easily], diamonds in the Diamond Mine gamemode spawning outside the map and making it unwinnable, and infinite flying through block abuse, just to name a few.)-Horrendous lag and server optimizations. ( Even on a server only a 1 hour drive from my house I had 136 ping. Most people had 200+. This happens on almost every server.)Overall, It's a VERY bad remake of a previously good game. I honestly can't suggest the original either because nowadays it's full of people who don't speak a word of english, hackers EVERYWHERE, horrible lag due to people connecting to servers from outside countries running around with 300+ ping, and 6 yr old kids griefing and trolling. If you still want to see it, it is now called Build And Shoot.Rating: 1/101 from decent graphics."

Keeping the skillet at medium heat, ladle about 1/4 cup of the batter onto the skillet, to make a pancake. Make 1 or 2 more pancakes, taking care to keep them evenly spaced apart.

Ace of Spades is not even worth the sale price, hell, its barely even worth the bandwitdh it takes to download it. Do yourself a favor, buy minecraft, and look for a server with the same kind of mods you are interested in and play there."

It went from being a slow paced, tactical, block building shooter to... well... just the opposite. Now AOS is face paced (and not in the good way), it is non-tactical, the building is pointless, and is just overall unbalanced and clunky. With small maps to jetpack around the idea of creating a wall/ fort to stop the enemy from pushing forward has died. Also the plethra of explosives allow for building to be chopped down in seconds. Pre-made building schematics were also added which takes away from spending time creating the best fort defense. Tunneling and slowly advancing forward on the battlefield have been replaced with running and jumping over gaps, up walls, and through the fury of bullets to reach the objective. Everthing that was great about the original is gone! And the game isn't even good after pushing aside the fact of the superior original. When Jagex aquired the rights to this game they were given the chance to bring it to the next level with their larger development team and greater capital to spend refining it. They unfortunately only saw it as a money maker and cried out a big F you to the community. They also said screw you to the original developer in the in game credits. I highly advise not buying this game though I highly advise trying the original (link below). While the new version definitely has a graphical advancement over the original the fact of which has better gameplay cannot be denied. Plus the original's low res look allows for any rig to run the game and being free all of your friends can afford it allowing for endless hours of fun. So stop reading and go to the link below! And thank Ben Aksoy for creating such an awesome game.Original Ace of Spades:http://buildandshoot.com/"

It's so bad that it halves the value of the game in my opinion.-Game is Buggy:(A) Vote Menus that never disappear.(B) Team switching at the end of a Zombie match causes unlimited round life / unlimited respawns.(C) Nade Exploit in Specialist class can cause players to get stuck until they die, or worse can crash the server.Between the rediculously OP Parachute and these bugs, this game is all but destroyed in all game modes, and needs a serious rebalancing in the Zombie mode.It's more popular on European Servers as of late so expect bad ping if you're in North America.

The maps of the game are all blocks, and you can place & destroy blocks to reach the enemy’s base, fortify your base etc. When the game first cameout, many users were fascinated by the unique gmaeplay, and the developers made a lot of money. However, after the popularity returned to normal, developers deserted the game, and the unbalanced system and the lack of updates destroyed the huge potential behind Ace of Spades.The first problem of ace of spades is that balance between the 4 classes(Engineer, Sniper, Commando, Miner) is unfair, as the sniper is too overpowered. Snipers are more agile than other players, and sniping is very easy in this game. There is no air resistance and speed when shooting bullets, as bullets go in a straight line and as soona s you click the trigger, your target, no matter how far they are, get hit instantly. For this reason you can kill other players even when a tiny bit of their body sticks out from where they are hiding. Headshots give an instant kill, but heads on character models are too big, and you can become an easy target. Nearly everybody picks the sniper, and the game quickly becomes boring.Block physics in ace of spades are a core element, but can also be very frustrating as well. One of the physics is if you break the bottom blocks on a structure, the whole structure collapses. on one map, our team’s spawnpoint was on the rooftop of a tall and wide building. The other team broke the ground blocks at the bottom of the building, and our building was destroyed. However, the game still spawned us on the location of the rooftop, and every time we respawned, we fell and died because of the fall damage. As team members are also allowed to do this, I got griefed many times because of one of my team members. Breaking blocks are very easy, as there are many explosive items. This causes many problems. For instance, the enemy kept blowing up our spawnpoint, and it became a huge pit after some time. Everytime I spawned, I either died because of fall damage after falling into the pit, of died because of enemies who ambushed me. No matter how many blocks you stack in your base, the enemy will break through anyway. Spawn kills are inevitable, as there isn’t any territory prohibition.The game is very poorly managed, as it frequently lags and I often get kicked out of a server for no reason. These days almost no users are on servers. There isn’t enough players to even make one match, and since the game is all about multiplayer, you won’t even be able to play the game.Ace of Spades in it’s current state is a complete mess, but has plenty of room for improvement. However, the developers have already left it after making their money, and players eventually gave up as well. Ace of Spades has become an empty game which definitely isn’t worth your 15$."

Objective based games and Zombies is where the fun is to be had in this game, and the large scale maps with a high level of construct/destruct-ability are a nice touch for maneuvering around chokepoints by user created stuff.All things considered, its the customization and rigid class structure that keep AoS for being anything more than a fun game for a couple of hours. Grab the DLC and the game during a sale, and it'll be good fun for at least 2 hours."

Ma analizziamolo nel dettaglio:- Giocabilità (5/10): Molto lineare, le varie modalità di gioco non influsicono molto sul gameplay in sè.- Grafica (3/10): Pur essendo fatta apposta per assomigliare a Minecraft, manca di texture e cura.- Sonoro (5/10): Neanche gli effetti audio si salvano: dai passi agli spari.- Frame rate (?/10): Molti lamentano dei cali di frame rate; personalmente non ne ho visti ma credo sia una cosa da prendere in considerazione.- Multiplayer (2/10): Pur essendo incentrato sul Multiplayer, è la parte che pecca di più: se si decide di partecipare a partite casuali, 2 volte su 3 ci si ritrova in server vuoti. Ultimamente vi è anche un ingente numero di hacker che si divertono a modo loro.VOTO COMPLESSIVO: 3.75/10Sconsiglio l'acquisto del gioco al suo prezzo di base (12€).

There's a ton of balance issues in the game currently, and Jagex has abandoned it in favor of it's newer project, Block'n'Load, where they don't have to cater to those of us who loved the old Ace of Spades in her glory days.My playtime is more from getting the achievements than just playing for fun. I've had some decent fun in classic mode, but it's definitely not worth the price nowadays considering how dead the game is. There's only a couple active servers at any given time, with most game modes being abandoned.If you played Ace of Spades previously and you're wanting to give it a try, you're better off looking for communities that run the original game, such as build n shoot."

I was quite dissapointed that the game was not as cool as the trailer.Even with all of these factored in, I would still play this game, but what really pushed me into not recomending this game is the new DLC. This just shows how much the developers neglect the other players, and favor those who buy stuff from them, even though all of the players bought this game for 20$ (...unless you bought it while it was on sale like I have). The game was BEGGING for an update with other cool classes, maps and other stuff, but what did the devs give their players? A DLC THAT RUINS THE GAME FOR THE PLAYERS THAT DID NOT PURCHASE SUCH PRODUCT.I would rate this a 5/10.

I don't even mean that to be an♥♥♥♥♥to CoD players, this game plays like disney's version of the game Toy Soldiers.There are other game modes, like classic, but you will get bored of those somewhat quickly. Classic is played like ww1, with trench warfare and bold action rifles, but if you want that, then go play Verdun. The 30s gangster gamemode is fun, but gets boring because nobody ever plays it. At this point, the developers have screwed over the playerbase so much that nobody seems to play anything but a single server of zombies.Count this game as dead. The developers have decided it."

It's got you covered.★ Like blowing $hit up? Boy have I got a....★ Numerous game modes.★ Customisable maps.★ Plug and play attitude.★ Zombie mode!Cons:✖ Deeply competitive gamers won't stay long.✖ Like any FPS... pro snipers suck.✖ Sets unrealistic expectations about digging your way to China.Ace of Spades is your game that you pull out after a real bad day of school or work. It entertains you for hours with the silliness involved and doesn't require a huge amount of skill to play. If you're thinking of running a LAN? No problem! This game will have even the most awful FPSer enjoy and have a laugh within the game.This game introduces a few types of objective based games to the mix making it able to tickle everyone's fantasy. A personal favourite of mine was zombie mode which involved a large amount of paranoid and over zealous team mates to try and barricade themselves into a fort of over-confidence. Yes the game lets you create structures but it also lets the other team destroy and take advantage of it too! All I can say is don't get attached to anything in any game mode as even your team mate might be wanting your pixelated beard at any given time.Run, create, destroy and eat your way through many different levels and landscapes that offer many different entertaining ideals. This is a game that you will enjoy and will serve you well whether you wish to play just folks over the internet or your mates over a LAN party."

They've abandoned it and thus the community did too. So if you want to play a game with no people and dev.s that don't update feel free to spend your money on it. Otherwise just go get Blockade 3D, which is free and has far more users.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------(NOTE: I've left this part of the review up for the sake of additional information on the game. At the time of writing everything below, I recommended the game. This has changed.)--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------REVIEW FROM 2013Now this game is fun. Don't get me wrong. But, I will mostly mention the issues with it as every positive review you will find will have all the nice crap, and I think Jagex still needs to be slapped in the face for taking a nice conept and butchering it several times over.Ace of Spades (Which recently got the subtitle ""Battle Builder"") is a nice concept. Minecraft with a shotgun and objective sounds pretty damn cool to me. Unfortunately, the execution was a total flop. They took the simplicity and appeal of the original game away.One, the first generation was free, but that isn't necesseraly bad if the game is good (spoiler: the original one is still better). Jagex tried to add more TF2-style influence in the game with different classes. They did well, up to Rocketteer. The Rocketteer made anything to do with building useless. They can fly right over your building and shoot the hell out of you. So its become more of a digging game. In the even sense, the Classic mode is (surprise, surprise) the most even and generally best mode (the rest sort of suck as the objectives encourage digging, and all have the Rocketteer).In Classic, everyone gets a rifle, couple grenades, a shovel, and a tool to build with. Its actually quite fun. But, Jagex screwed up their graphic interface for a while (there was no server browser, as they thought their computer algorithms choice of server was better than your choice). So, of course, no one plays. Its impressive to find a server with 6 people on it (thats a LARGE server. Yah, its pretty depressing).So, they had a nice concept and a half decent game. They just made blunders along the way here so that about a total of 50 people across the globe still play this. And they still did not fix the Rocketteer issue. Or the other game mode issues. But it still is a half decent kinda fun game. So, if you find people willing to play, get them to play. And try to encourage them to make user run servers. This could pull in so many people."

I was naive at the time, and didn't even bother to search up reviews for the game. Boy, was I wrong in doing this (although it in no way made me be turned off by steam).Bottom line; this game is terrible, and do not expect more from it. Let me start off by saying that this game is horrid when it comes to anything, actually. The only people willing to play it anymore are those foolish enough to enjoy the lackluster gameplay, which, while may seem inviting and great at first, will soon turn into a bore and, quite honestly, a chore. The game has no depth in it and the maps are too linear. I recommend the free version online.More than that, there is DLC in this game, as if the fact it was already broken with various glitches was not enough. This already adds to the worst part of the game;You see, when somebody says they want to play a multiplayer fps, I think it means with various people. It's a network that *can* hold various people, after all. But with this game, you could never be so wrong. The one time I got on a server with people - 5 people, that is - the lag and latency was so high, I had to quit.All in all, do yourself a favor and *don't* buy this game.

It went from a really fun and balanced free to play game to a weird tf2/minecraft hybrid. It may sound good, but the execution was terrible. The old game was kind of a part of my childhood back in 2011 then Jagex picked it up and ruined it. If they would've kept the good and balanced gameplay and just added some maps here and there and some other modes and kept it f2p, it would've been great, but they added the classes and they even went so far as to make it $15. They do have the classic gamemode but that still doesn't make up for the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game they turned the wonderful beta into. Go get the free version of this that kept the good gameplay called openspades if you want something fun and balanced to play."

I'd actually be interested in playing this if there were people online playing it, but no, all the servers are empty.Like I said, making this F2P would boost the player count so people didn't have to risk $15 dollars and a week of waiting for a refund  just to try out this really dead game.Edit: if you're looking for a nice blocky game like this, I'd try Trove.

,Not Recommended,224540,34381719,Posted: 20 August,all,mcbean,"What do you get when you mix a terrible community, with cocky players, an unstable security system, and unbalanced gameplay? Ace of Spades by Jagex. I'm serious, 78% of the players who still actually play just do it to hack the game and troll players by insulting and belittling them based on how they play. Some hackers have even managed to disable the option to kick players by rigging the vote system to make it impossible for players to vote yes. Honestly this ""game"" if you'd even call it that any more, is worth less than the dirt we walk on every day. Nearly every player I have met was condescending and insolent. The gameplay is abysmal, apalling, and unequal. You will end up tearing hair out of your scalp because of how frustratingly terrible the game plays and how easily you get slaughtered. The only problem is, you can't take out your foes as easily as they can. You may find yourself hitting an enemy upwards of about 8 times, however the player you have been hitting has only been taking 1 damage from your bullets. The only way to instantly kill opponents is to get a head shot. Even then it's not guaranteed that it will do anything. Save yourselves from hours of torment by simply playing the original game atwww.buildandshoot.com. I honestly have not even the slightest idea why I  gave this game a second chance. The only redeeming factor of the game is the map editor."

It used to be a real hit and it was the first steam game i ever played, and also one of the first games I ever played (following Super Mario Bros. Wii). I used to have a lot of fun with it. You could create your own maps, play a bunch of different game modes, and generally do whatever you wanted, within reason. But it was passed on to another company, and there came the Hurt + Heal DLC Pack. This made the game pay to win. Now it's horrible and badly reviewed.
