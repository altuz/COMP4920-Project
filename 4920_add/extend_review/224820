If you have skipped previous sales, by all means add this one to your wishlist so you can get it for a cheap price once it gets a big discount (or gets bundled) in the future.Super House of Dead Ninjas is an Arcade title that puts your reflexes to the test. You have to drop all the way to the bottom of an evil tower filled with deadly traps, mobs and boss fights. Each tower you run through is randomly generated. There are new weapons and items that can be unlocked by meeting certain requirements. A timer keeps the tension present all the time; if you let it drop to 0, you'll lose a live, however there are items that will let you either freeze or reset the counter.I have played this game for over 20 hours and I still haven't gotten tired of it. It is so good! If only it allowed multiplayer runs or challenges. Oh well, maybe for the sequel.Get this hidden gem. You will definitely enjoy it."
,Recommended,224820,10330367,"Posted: 2 June, 2014",all,Squire Grooktook,"Super House of Dead Ninjas is another very solid entry into the recent list of randomly generated action games on the pc market.Throughout the game, you're constantly descending a randomly generated tower at breakneck speed. There's a timer, as well as score bonuses for chain killing enemies encouraging you to go as fast as possible and kill as many enemies as possible without slowing down. It's very offense oriented, with not much dodging and a very strong emphasis on just blazing through everything without making any mistakes (a bit of a minus for me personally, since I prefer complex dodging, but it's definitely an interesting play style).There are not many flaws that I can think of, as it overall feels well thought out. My biggest complaint is that the various traps and levels the rng gives you often feel a bit same-y, and lack strategic variety. Things do get harder as you progress, but once you've seen one set of hazards, you've pretty much seen them all, and that's all you really do throughout the course of the game. The ultra fast move speed also feels a bit unwieldy during some of the boss fights as well, though that could just be me.It's a good game for sure, just not one of my favorites (play style is interesting but not really my style, and the slight lack of variety hurts it a bit too in my opinion). If you're on the fence, I'd recommend watching a gameplay video, because it plays exactly the way it looks. If it looks like something that'll scratch your speed running arcade ninja itch, than pick it up because you'll probably enjoy it a lot."

The lightning fast combat and sensitive controls can seem a bit unwieldy at first, but they ultimately lead to a uniquely adrenaline-charged ""ninja"" feel that only hurtling through the levels at a breakneck speed can create. There is a wealth of unlocks as well, the only problem being that after showering the player with new weapons and upgrades during the first few hours of gameplay they slow to a mere trickle. Add to that the unusual order in which upgrades unlock, and you have a recipe for potentially unsatisfying progression.Still, the meat of the gameplay is, like a fine steak, rare and delicious. Although the game suffers from ""roguelike repetition"" the randomly generated levels and enemies each present unique obstacles which push a player's reflexes to the maximum as they adjust on-the-fly. Gamers who love this genre will find Super House of Dead Ninjas to be a superb entry with many hours of replayability as they race to survive long enough for that elusive high score."

Most normal foes take one hit to kill, and the rest only 2.... so you can make quick work of your opponents while blazing through the levels. Unfortunately you can only take one hit before death as well, so it can be tricky at times. You respawn instantly if you have any reserve lives though, which is nice- no 'start from X point and do it all over again cuz you died' type of mechanics.  Its a lot of fun in short bursts-- that is, this is a game that you can pick up and put 10-30 minutes into easily, but probably wont feel like playing much more than that. Simple to pick up, difficult to master... Id say its worth the normal asking price, but Im spoiled on Steam sales so Id recommend to get it cheap.

,Recommended,224820,24252385,"Posted: 11 July, 2016",all,Oke'd,"Few games epitomise the cultural style of 1980s American film and television as well asSuper House of Dead Ninjas, the fast-paced, blood-soaked action platformer from Megadev. Based on the 2011 flash gameHouse of Dead Ninjas, the game challenges players to enter a tower known as the Ziggurat of Infinium through the roof and descend down its hundreds of floors, battling the tower’s demonic occupants in a frenetic quest to discover what lurks on the ground floor.You can tell from the game’s title what kind of toneSuper House of Dead Ninjasis trying to invoke. The deliberately cheesy, over-the-top style of action is reminiscent of things like the oldTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, with a healthy dosage of wall-to-wall ultra-violence seemingly pinched from a Quentin Tarantino film. The game is packed with testosterone-filled voice-overs to mock you when you fail and commend you when you do something particularly “Hellacious”. Combined with an early '90s platformer aesthetic,Super House of Dead Ninjashas a nice little retro-style vibe about it, making the whole joint seem all the more outrageous and light-hearted.Behind the cartoony visuals, however, are modes with some pretty vicious difficulty. While the Ziggurat is gory cakewalk on normal difficulty, the challenge is amped up pretty quickly once you get to extra dungeons, particularly the endgame ‘Abarghus’ Domain’. The unlockable weapons are a lot of fun to use, mostly because they’re deliberately more difficult to use than the defaults, but reward skill with bonuses like the ability to destroy traps. Some of the combinations you can use are insane, particularly those which allow you to skip multiple floors at a time.The problem with the difficulty is that a lot of the parts that are hard are just a select few especially brutal rooms that may or may not be inserted into your run through random generation. It isn’t a massive issue, but it can get a little frustrating when the game generates several difficult rooms in quick succession.Another thing I love aboutSuper House of Dead Ninjasis the support for speedrunning. TheTrue Ninja PackDLC unlocks a dedicated speedrun mode that times your descent and recording your respective times for the three areas (the Roof, Abyss of Nature and Royal Sanctum) as well as your overall run time. It’s a nice, surprising touch that really adds to the game’s replayability and introduces an element of competition through Steam leaderboards that let you directly compare yourself to your friends.In conclusion,Super House of Dead Ninjasis worth not only its own price, but also the price of its DLC pack, as the replayability and overall polish of the game is just astounding."

Controls can make or break a platformer and these are just great. You move and attack so quickly, but you feel in total control of your ninja the entire time.You need very good reflexes for this game and the ability to watch a lot of things at the same time. Enemies can react VERY quickly to your character. Good thing the game has a great built in mechanic. When you kill a lot of enemies in a row, in quick succession, you will activate your Rage ability. You become invincible during this and kill everything in 1 hit, not counting bosses.The game also has an awesome unlock system. I don't know the exact number, but somewhere around 75 different unlockable equipment, abilities and powerups are in the game. I really like this unlock system, because the better you do in the game, the better unlocks you will get access to for your next run. Expect to die a ton when first starting out, then when you start getting access to the upgraded equipment and things, you will get a lot further and eventually complete your first run through the tower.This game can be beaten in around 4 minutes (go watch the speedrun on Youtube, it looks amazing)! The replay value is extremely high though. Lots of different modes to play, including a boss rush and speedrun mode. The unlockables will keep you busy for a long time. Leaderboards to try and improve your best times and scores. Not to mention the game is just extremely fun to play.

,Recommended,224820,24500522,"Posted: 24 July, 2016",all,Celery,"Super House of Dead Ninjas is a game I must admit to being skeptical about at first. It's based on a flash game and from Adult Swim. Those aren't exactly the things I hope to see when looking at a potential game.  To be fair there are plenty of great flash games out there. Unbeknownst to me, apparently Adult Swim has published some good games.  As a result of my doubts, I held off on buying it for a while.Super House of Dead Ninjas is a fast paced action platformer.  You play as a ninja trying to make her way down to the bottom of a tower filled with all sorts of traps and monsters.  The tower is semi-randomly generated so each run will be somewhat different from the last.  At the start of each run the player can select  a melee weapon, a ranged weapon, a bomb, and a magical attack.  There is also a chaos mode which provides a random selection of items.  In order to unlock new items you must accomplish specified challenges.  I found that trying to unlock the different items and upgrades was as fun as using them.Sadly, there is one flaw with the way they handled the unlocks.  On the item selection screen there are items that the game says you must buy the DLC to unlock.  I've never been a fan of this sort of practice and would prefer base games to have no or minimal references to DLC.  It is a form of in game advertising and it makes games feel incomplete and cheap.  I suppose you could consider the fact that the DLC is inexpensive to be a saving grace, but I still don't like how this was handled.While the game doesn't have much of a storyline, the way it's told is creative.  There is a short comic book integrated into the game that tells the story and provides the basics of playing the game.  The comic is well drawn, but I wish there were actually additional issues as hinted towards the end.  The presentation of the rest of the game is solid as well.  It's very clear MegaDev was going for a 16-bit era feel.  Right when the game is booted up and while it's loading, a Super Nintendo styled box for Super House of Dead Ninjas is displayed.  One thing caught my eye about this though.  The loading text mentions blast processing which was a marketing gimmick from Sega and not Nintendo.  It's unimportant, but it feels like a small detail that shouldn't have been hard to get right.I'm happy my initial doubts for this game weren't confirmed.  It feels great to rush to the bottom of the tower as fast as possible.  The variety of useful items and high mobility of the main character make the game reminiscent to the Ninja Gaiden series.  The gameplay is addictive, and it's easy to play a quick run in 10 minutes or less.  That said, the game is short.  It took me about four hours to go from never having played the game to beating it on hard mode.  I've found myself return to it several times already due to the high level of replayability.  It isn't hard to see that someone could spent a lot of time getting all of the unlocks.  I recommend this to game fans of action platformers, and to people that wonder what it would be like if Sonic the Hedgehog and Ninja Gaiden's Ryu Hyabusa had a child together.Like the review?

,Recommended,224820,22804280,"Posted: 4 May, 2016",all,Dravvad,"I got this game on sale, somewhat randomly. Turns out that I loved playing it. The game is simple - you must get down through a tower as fast as possible (you have a timer which you can find item pickups to extend) and fight bosses and, well, reach the bottom.But, the tower is randomly generated each time that you play. The height of the tower remains the same, and you encounter the same number of bosses (though they have a small chance to change too, except for the final boss). But the rooms themselves and the enemies that you come across will shift a ton. Some of the rooms you get are super easy to get through quickly; some are just terrible pains. For a while it's just up to luck.However, you get to build yourself up the more you play. There are a ton of weapons and power-ups you can obtain by meeting certain goals, some of which are actually negative goals - for instance, you gain more lives after you die certain numbers of times, or you gain extra time on the timer after you reach certain points in the tower. Some of the upgrades are permanent like the ones just mentioned, or the weapons you unlock, while others get unlocked but are randomly found by killing enemies or destroying objects.While it certainly takes some getting used to, the game is a lot of fun and can be played for a good amount of time for some challenge. However, once you unlock most things and have successfully completed the game numerous times, I don't think it has that much of a long life. I still have the DLC to get and try out with some new content, and I tried the side-world that requires collected tickets to play in... And while it all is still fun to varying extents, I don't think I'll play the game in big time periods much - there isn't enough longevity to it. But others may find that to be different! (Especially people who love extensively speedrunning.)Either way, the game isn't that expensive, so you should be willing to give it a try if it looks like it'll be some fun for you."

I have only seen the first 2 bosses and about half of the third area, so I dont have much knowledge past that point.Super House of Dead Ninjas is a fast paced platformer with rogue like elements. I don't feel like it's the most random rogue like out there, the levels feel generally the same each run. the thing is, the speed of the game makes up for that. you are going too fast that level generation doesn't really seem that important.why is the game so fast paced? first off, there is a timer in the bottom right that counts down from 35 seconds. if that timer hits 0, prepare to get chased by a demonic figure until you get another timer pickup. this function makes you rush as fast as possible through each level. another thing that makes it fast is that your character moves at a speedy rate. also the reason I play ridiculously fast is because honestly, the only gameplay I've seen is speedruns ( which SHODN is perfect for ).items are not a big part in this game; the items on the floors are only pickups that increase amount of magic, projectiles, and time. there are starting weapons you can unlock, but so far they don't really seem that different? they are fairly balanced as well. the unlock system is nice, like some unlocks you just get from simply doing runs normally, but some require different challenges to do. no weapon seems necessarily OP, they just have a longer range or some other small bonus.enemies aren't very varied, which is one of the only cons to SHODN. they add 2 or 3 new enemy types for each ""zone"" and that's it. the thing is, enemy variation isn't needed! you tear through each enemy so fast that it really doesn't matter!bosses are challenging, but aren't grinding bosses with loads of health. they are just simple bosses with a couple patterns to master, so honestly, they are more of a miniboss than a full fledged boss. again, I haven't fought the final boss myself so I don't know if he's any more interesting than the other bosses.overall, I give this game a 9/10!"
,Recommended,224820,811595,"Posted: 2 March, 2013",all,mark | dj.,"Great game with tight controls and beautiful retro graphics. Imagine one (three total), big, random Super Meat Boy level. This level will have you go down instead of up. There's also a timer that will force you to keep going. You can extend the timer by killing enemies and collecting their power-ups, or by unlocking certain achievements. The levels become harder the further down you get, and there are some cool boss fights that will remind anyone of the earlier Mega Man games. There are also in-game achievements that will unlock new weapons, abilities and outfits, making the game supposedly easier later on.The screenshots had me worried this would be 'one of those' games (you know, simple graphics and gameplay, zero heart and fun), but I'm so glad I gave this a try.

,Recommended,224820,1942257,"Posted: 14 July, 2013",all,Eddard Stark,"Seems I am a sucker for good rogue-like titles. Still, this one is yet again entirely different from the others - here, not careful planning (DoD), not smart resource management (FTL) not even pure luck (Binding of Isaac) will help you in this game.Here, the only clearly visible rogue-like element is the random generated floors. And the fact that you will die and die a lot. Still, this is much, much more fast paced than any rogue titles I have played, going in similar with Super Meat Boy if you couldn't stop moving.In this game, you controll a ninja, going downwards a huge tower. All the equipment you need is chosen from the lodge, the screen before the start of the game. Any other items you get inside the tower are ammo refills or boosts. So, every piece of equipment you get is permanent. And although you do need to choose which weapon/piece of equipment to use before the game, the items are usually better versions of older pieces; some of them are even direct powerups of previous weapons. This and the fact that almost everything you do (yes, even dying) counts towards an achievement which awards you with new and better equipment will lead to a ""power transfer"", where you will go farther and farther down the floors not only because of your own skill (which is one of the main reasons of a rogue title) but also because you will have much better equipment.Still, it is really satisfying to clear a floor with ease and defeat the floor boss without losing a single life when you used to take up all your lives just to get to the darn bugger.Although it slightly lacks the witt the developers Adult Swim are known for, the gameplay is way too satisfying to pass up. Honing your ninja skills and defeating baddies that killed you countless times with a single overhead strike feels absolute.The action is amazing, the items are different and spaced out enough to keep you interested, the fact that every single achievement gives a new item adds replayability and the awesome price makes this little indie title a bargain of the decade.Oh, and get yourself a controller. Bothering with a keyboard will make your ninja fingers commit seppuku."

One of the best games I’ve ever played, and I recommend it to anyone looking for the feel of classic 1980s action games.This a 16-bit style 1980s style action game.  This game basically is reminiscent of NES games such as Castlevania (1986) and Ninja Gaiden (1989).  The level design is interesting in that you begin at the top of a tower and you are trying to make your way to the bottom.  During playthroughs you can earn different weapons (i.e., whips, flame throwers, baseball bats, etc.) and power ups (i.e., slow downs).  You equip these different weapons before starting the game.  You have a host of offensive weapons, including your main weapon, throwing weapons, and bombs.  There are also spells.  The games play is similar to the classic games already mentioned.  However, these is a timer, and you have to keep a pretty speedy pace as you through the game.  There are time extension pickups, but you never get to just slow down.  This makes the game unbelievably fast paced.  The game has a lot of replay value because of custom maps, randomly generated content, and the speed of the game. Pick this game up, especially during a sale.  Pro-tip, avoid watching any speedruns before you’ve played a bit."

There's a short timer that encourages the player to move faster through the level. Killing enough enemies with melee attacks, in short amount of time, will send the player into Rage Mode, giving the ability to kill all enemies with one hit.Defeating a mini-boss will set up a checkpoint for the player to start from in subsequent games.I enjoy the retro graphics, and fast gameplay most. The enemies crack me up, my favorite being the monkeys. Another fun feature is that the game will randomly create a special baddie named after someone in your friends list.The game has a bit of a learning curve and it takes some time to figure out how to take on the enemies, traps, and mini-bosses.  For example, the Butt-Face Horse Pigs take a bunch of hits to kill, there are numerous traps that will catch you off guard, etc.Continuous play rewards you with buffs like cosmetic colors, extra lives, ammo, weapons, and buffs. This helps soften the learning curve.I highly recommend this game :)"

The pacing is super fast as you work your way down the hundreds of floors that make up this enemy- and trap-infested tower. The mechanics are simple to get a hang of yet can be difficult to master and will test your reflexes constantly. Thankfully the game controls nicely with a 360 pad because I couldn't imagine executing some of these precise maneuvers on a keyboard. A strong variety of weapons/explosives/powerups at your disposal will aid you on your trek downward. Floors are randomly-generated, but for the most part each section feels mostly the same from one playthrough to the next. This could result in some repetitiveness over time. In spite of that, SHODN has a very addictive feel to it thanks to the overall pacing and arcade-style gameplay. Strikes me as a great ""Pick up and play"" type game for short 30-minute bursts in the same vein as The Binding Of Isaac.In all, this is a highly enjoyable rogue-like that features some frantic action, crisp controls, and fun/satisfying combat. A nice throwback to the old-school hack-and-slash days that's well worth the bargain basement price."
76561198053660745,Recommended,224820,9651202,"Posted: 28 March, 2014",all,Packrat,"Imagine if Spelunky was as fast-paced as Super Meat Boy, with a dash of Rogue Legacy thrown in for good measure. Super House Of Dead Ninjas is kind of like that. It's not a perfect comparison, but it provides a general idea of what you can expect.SHODN is a platformer without levels in the traditional sense. The game is one long level, which is semi-procedurally generated as you descend ever lower. It is not fully procedural because the game creates this super-level by drawing from an inventory of handmade ""rooms"". The enemies that populate the rooms are fixed in some cases, but for most are also selected randomly, as are the majority of the pickups to be found within. The types of rooms to be found range from simple corridors with an enemy or two, to labyrinthine beasts that will have you scratching your head trying to figure out how you're expected to make it through without dying.The fact that the rooms are premade, but populated and thrown at you randomly, makes every run unique, and allows you to get better with practice through sheer muscle memory like a traditional platformer while still keeping you on your toes regarding what's coming next. No game provides player feedback quite like SHODN, with the voice of the final boss insulting you for making mistakes and praising you for impressive feats throughout the game, providing the game with a unique kind of personality.While you're practicing the game (mainly by dying a whole bunch), you can also unlock new weapons to start your runs with, as well as new pickups that will spawn in future runs. You unlock these by accomplishing goals listed in the loadoat screen while playing, very similar to achievements, only better because they provide new content to play with. (There are also standard achievements for those who like them.) Most of these unlockables are designed to make future runs easier, but certain weapon unlocks can provide entirely new approaches to the game. There's a nice variety of weapons to unlock, and even an option to start with a random loadout, providing a large number of ways to play the game. Be aware that some of the goals required to unlock things actively revel in their extreme difficulty, just like the game as a whole.The fast-paced nature of the game is enforced by a timer. When the timer hits zero, Death himself will start chasing you through the level with a scythe. It's possible to outrun him for a little while, but you cannot outmaneuver him. Whereas Spelunky gives you 2 minutes before its ghost appears, SHODN only gives you 30 seconds to find a timer refill pickup to avoid this fate. If that sounds unforgiving, note that you start with multiple lives, which is good because you'll probably need every single one of them.Being an indie game, it has some bugs and is unoptimized in a few areas, but I strongly encourage you to not let that put you off. With the near-infinite replayability provided by its random generation and addictively-difficult gameplay complemented by silky-smooth controls, I highly recommend SHODN, particularly to any fan of platformers."

It was only a week or so later that I got my hands on a proper Razer controller. When I played with the ocntroller instead, I felt the change in my game performance; the difference was astronomical! I enjoyed it better and I had also finally beat the boss (normal).Let's get one thing straight, though. Even with the controller at my disposal, the game was still rather difficult. It was indeed hard but it was at the same time fun! It wasn't that kind of challenge where I got frustrated. It was the kind of challenge that pushed me to be more careful and efficient with every single button I pressed. It really made me feel like a true ninja; a ninja that makes the most out of their items and resources in completing tasks.

While a death doesn't mean game over if playing  normal mode. Just to save you time play hard mode from the start, so you can get the most amount of unlocks as quickly as possible.

The controls for the platformer are extremely tight and responsive. If you died it's your fault. Game is a perfect balance of fairness and challange.

When time goes down you don't die, the grim reaper shows up to kill you. You can evade him, if you are quick and skilled enough.Franky there doesn't need much to be said about this game. If you watch a trailer of 30 seconds you can get the gist of it. I'm just writting here to asure you that it's superb. A simple addictive rouge-like platformer that is jam packed with skill paced action humor and satisfaction. Get this."

Almost endless replayability, the tower you try to descend from top floor, except for the first short tutorial level, changes every playthrough and so do the bosses you encounter (except the final one). You unlock new gear and power-ups by doing achievements in-game, some power-ups are permanent, while others unlock the possibility to find them in game, while the gear, you unlock melee weapons, bombs, magic and throwing weapons. You can customize your gear before going to try to beat the tower and choose one for every category stated above, you may change your costume too and off you go. The gameplay itself is very frenetic,  but satisfying, I personally don't like platformers very much because I tend to get angry with them after a while, but not this one, most of the time you're like ""ehh, that was my fault, I can regain that heart if I play carefully.""

The game is meticulously developed with intense care. Although it lacks immersion, it's an arcade game; who the f**k cares? There is also a comic, which I encourage you to read, or even glance at, to accumulate some insight into the game.The degree of scrupulousness in this game is eminent. The developers have taken high precision into the construction of this game. If there is a conspicuous glitch, please notify me, because I am impressed with how smooth-running this game is. I am fastidious myself, or in other words: show symptoms related to OCD, and I commend the developers for being conscientious.Augmenting on that note, for a 2D game, the graphics will prevail over most art-style games that I have played. The particle systems are astounding; as I mentioned above, the developer is very diligent and takes care of his work. SHoDN also incorporates blood into the game, albeit, if you dislike it, then there is an option to disable it.Now, let's discuss the game itself. What makes Super House of Dead Ninjas miraculous; what is so significant about its gameplay? Well... there is the adrenaline of escaping a mansion, and if you take too long, a demon emerges to eviscerate you. I am unsure whether it is conjured, or if it just simply catches up to you. Anyway, there is the exuberance of racing through each level, and fighting the boss which concludes it. SHoDN will make you feel zealous; full of energy, with the incentive of completing each level.The plethora of achievements also motivate players to continue playing; if you want to unlock a new weapon or item, you must perform a strenuous, but rudimentary task (e.g. kill 100 enemies using an inaccurate bomb). Obviously, more powerful items require a more onerous task.The world itself is randomised, eerie and ominous. However, some would argue that it lacks immersion. My following argument is contentious, but I believe that an arcade game, especially a 2D one, does not require immersion. Arcade games derive from the style of ""arcade machines"", and if you have ever played on an arcade machine, then presumably, you would understand. If you disagree, please enlighten me; conceptualise this game as an arcade machine, and tell me that it requires immersion.To conclude, Super House of Dead Ninjas is an action-packed platformer with a myriad of amusement. The game is well-developed, and I will personally punch anyone in the face who disagrees. This game is truly memorable, and I encourage you not to be prejudice based on the concept. ~ Rating: 9.4/10"

When I first bought SHoDN during the summer sale, I played it about three times and I didn't get it.  There wasn't a lot of explanation to the game and with the over stimulation that the summer sale brings, I didn't have the attention span to sit down and give it a chance.  I wound up shutting the game down, vaguely wondering if I wasted $3 and proceeded to waste my time in other things.Cut to three weeks later, I see people talking about SHoDN on the forums a lot and I figure I paid $3 for it; I might as well give it a shot.  The first time through, I thought the keyboard controls were a little cumbersome but I was starting to understand the game concept; score points, extend your time, get us far down the tower as you can. Seemed solid, it was starting to sink its claws in.Later that morning, I was messaged by someone on my friends list, urging me to submit my scores so they had somebody to compete against on the leader boards.  I hadn't even realized there were leaderboards, so I played through again and submitted.  That's when the claws sunk in even deeper; competing against your friend’s high scores is super addictive.  I figured I was in there, so I started clicking around in the menus and that's when I discovered that there's controller support in SHoDN!  Around this time, a game I thought I might have wasted my money on turned into a full on addiction.SHoDN is dead simple in concept, but with challenging maps and tight controls it turns into a great little time attack platformer.  It's difficult in all the right ways and its design of getting ever farther down the tower, combined with trying to outscore your friends list makes it a game you'll return to.  It’s simple nature makes it a perfect fit for those times when you want 10 minutes of distraction instead of 3 hours of character development, but there's a strong chance it's going to suck you into that dreaded, ""just one more try"" state of mind.I've yet to try the new DLC that was added this week, but it's officially on the wish list!"

The ninja's controls take a bit getting used to, but once you do, you'll find s/he controls very well.In short if you like old school action games, then you'll love this and for the sale price on the 18th, it's worth buying it and the DLC ASAP."
,Recommended,224820,13133806,"Posted: 28 November, 2014",all,Fargin Noob,"What a fantastic platformer. It's fairly easy to learn and especially difficult to master. Even when you think you've gotten to a point where you can just plow through the floors as quickly as possible, the game says, ""No,"" and hits you in the face with a hidden saw blade, or a flying enemy, or the challenge of the bosses each of the way through.If I'm rating the game on a number scale, I'm probably going to give it in the range of 8-9 out of 10. But the game is not without its flaws. First, there's the hit box: it's inconsistent. Most of the time it's exactly as you'd expect. You swing your sword (or 'chuks, or whip) and you hit your target. But there are times where I see the weapon sprite contact with the enemy sprite and it does no damage. This happens enough for it to be an issue, but not so much that it's a game stopper.The other big issue has to do with telegraphing. The enemies don't really do a good job of it, and you'll very easily find yourself dying or getting hit by the enemies and bosses because there's little to no indication of a telegraphed attack. Compound this with a double jump that's a little low and you'll find sometimes that you have to be perfect more often then you should need in some cases to proceed. (Edit: I just found the super jump after writing the review, so that makes some boss fights potentially a bit easier.)Now these aren't really ""big"" issues in the normal sense; but in the context of the game, they can add up to some pretty frustrating moments.All in all though, the game is a fantastic platformer with a super progression path and you should definitely check it out."

It’s an arcade game, the gameplay is the most essential. You're Crimson Ninja, a deadly assassin who wants to descend a 250-Floor Tower filled with all sorts of hostile monster in order to prove her honour. That's preety much it. There is a nice and very well drawn comic book in the game, but it won't explain anymore than what I just wrote in the previous sentence.  Super House of Dead Ninjas combat system gives you a couple of options to fight with. You can use your main weapon, perform a dive attack, use a throwable consumable, use an explosive consumable (careful not to blow yourself up with it though) and use an ultimate powerful magic trick.  You will feel like a fast and skilled ninja. Don’t get attacked too much, you only have a handful of health points.Enemy variation is good but it could always use more. Killing the same enemies isn't boring and some will require a special trick. The feedback is good, enemies get dismembered in a psychotically beautiful way and the blood splatters like paint into a canvas. You even have a narrator similar to that of Quake who compliments you if you’re awesome and tells you off if you suck.The bosses are a big meat of the game, get ready to rage a bit. They’re all very unique and require some strategy and skill to finish them off. Even though they’re hard, they’re fair but I do believe that Colossus is too hard. In order to dodge him, you have to jump over him while he charges at you. But even if a pixel of your character touches the Colossus then try not to throw your monitor or laptop out of the window. This boss is ridiculously hard!The upgrades are where I have a couple of problems with the game. I like that you have to unlock the items in a specific challenging way instead of simply grinding for the items like in RPGs. When you upgrade your health, for example, you can't turn off the upgrade and we encounter another issue. The leaderboards are therefore unfair because it doesn't take into account the upgrades you used. In Serious Sam games, the score will be influenced by the difficulty you choose. For example, if you chose easy, your score won't have a multiplier counter as high as of that of a player that chose a harder difficulty. Also, during the levels you can't check the requirements of unlocking certain; you have to remember them by heart. Now, you think that using new and different items helps the gameplay be more dynamic than it is, but that isn't the case. I find myself using the boomerang and the nunchucks more than other equipment. Furthermore, the game doesn't have preset equipment choice.On the technical level, the game looks like it was made in the 1990’s. The graphical style is pixilated and has so much charm for it. It even has effects to it to show your character’s momentum and speed. It runs preety well but it can tank when there is a lot of effects on the screen. Still though, this version of House of Dead Ninjas, is better coded and has more configuration options. The game has an in-built Steam Workshop, but honestly, the custom made levels are too short.Regarding the expansion, if you think that the base game of Super House of Dead Ninjas wasn't enough for you then I recommend the True Ninja Pack. It’s worth it really for the price. You even get to play it with a new ninja with different stats.In conclusion, the game is great! I think it would be better if it would be played on a mobile device. It’s a small game that should be played more than once and on the go. Still though, the game is worth it for sure and the price is fair! I recommend it!"

The art design gels well with the mechanics of the game. Enemies are colourful and stand out against the backgrounds, which is very important in such a fast paced game.The game sits somewhere between a speed runner and an ultra hard platformer. While the enemies aren't overly difficult, the looming threat of the timer hitting zero (reset each life or with pickups) keeps things interesting. Defeating enemies (and doing so extremely fast) is very satisfying.Highly polished, and very enjoyable. Gotta-go-fast."

The gameplay is tight, the graphics are intresting and it's easy to quickly determine what's quickly coming towards you. Every single element that is in this game pushes forward a single theme for being an awesome extremely fast-paced action arcade game.Basically the gyst is you endlessly drop down and down through randomly generated enviromnents. The goal is to get as deep into the game as you can get. But to do that you have to slice the blood out of everything that moves. It even has freaking boss battles! Love it.It's got a really good sense of action. First of all the controls are tight, and that's the most important thing really. And then they also have really cool combo systems where you can become invincible and just wreck everything all day. There's lots of differnet weapons too add to replayablility. and just slicing enemies feels really good. It's just the way the game feels, the particles, the sound, and the animations. The way that all meshes makes slicing dudes feel slick. Really slick.And personally I like that the game is really forgiving. In a lot of these types of games you get 1 life and then have to restart, but in this game you can die multiple times. You get like 15 lives right off the bat or something crazy like that. I really like that, it helps keep the action going.It's one of those games that you'll lose, and then be like.... ok just 1 last run... i mean this time is the last time for sure.... oh but that run was crappy so it doesn't count... I get to keep playing until I get at least 1 good run....that sort of game.Also this game feels pulled out of time almost. It feels like and old classic arcade game from another universe that everybody knows and loves, like pacman... only for some reason our universe didnt get that game... it's perfectly retro.I wouldnt reccomend this game to people who won't be able to keep up with all the action. It's a hard game and it move FAST, and it can be really overwhelming really quickly. So I reccomend checking out some gameplay vids first to see if the pace is too fast for your taste.However, if you can handle the difficulty and speed of this game please go buy it. I'm not sure if Its gonna be like my personal favorite game ever or anything like that, but it's definitly a perfect game by all standards.OH, and you'll probably want to use a controller for this. If you don't have one I think that not having a controller WOULD stop me from ever wanting to play this. So keep that in mind if you don't have one."

Randomization of floors don't matter that much because most floors look and play the same, there is not enough variation. There is a decent amount of weapons available but sadly enough there is only a handfull that you will use because of its effectiveness compared to the rest. Behaviour of enemies is linear, predictable an not dynamic enough to keep my interest.The controls are a bit slippery which caused many unnecessary deaths. I have finished the game on normal, hard and played some post game content. Gameplay itself is pretty limited, every playthrough plays out the same.

,Not Recommended,224820,32781131,Posted: 25 June,all,Nae Nae Man™,"Even though the reviews for this game are Overwhelmingly Positive, I personally did not like this game.  While controls are responsive and everything works as intended, the game is simply repetitive.  The game plays really fast as well, meaning that your reaction times and movement/jumping has to always be precise, which can become hard due to the insane speed at which you move (not necessarily a bad thing, just a warning for buyers).  The difficulty in this game seems alright (not too hard if you're used to these type of games), but the lack of content seems to be the bigger issue.  If you do want to try this game out then get it on sale, as I can't recommend it at its full price.Everything becomes stale and feels way too repetitive before you're able to finish the game, as every level turns into ""let me just run to the bottom as fast as I can and avoid 99 floors of the same enemies,"" unlockables didn't feel like they changed much in the game either.

I still beat the game on normal in about 2 hours (it is very short), but never felt like I was having a good time, just pure frustration. The problem that blocked me from enjoying this game are the loose controls. I mean VERY loose. You slide around constantly and careen into enemies, environmental hazards, and bosses which are eventually beatable without taking any dmg because they are based purely on memorization. Because of the extremely slippery controls it is very tough, but it is do-able. I was taking about 1-3 hits per boss. The bosses take a long while to get to so the only real way you can get any practice on them is to get a user-made map that lets you boss run.I love platformer games and the reason I was able to beat the game so quickly without too much trouble was because I have always played platformers since I was a kid so I have some skill built up. Even so, I just did not enjoy the experience because of the incredibly loose slippery controls. If you look around, there are platformers out there that have much tighter controls without sacrificing the difficulty. Personally I hope we see less and less of these platformer games like this one and also “They Bleed Pixels” that are only difficult for one single reason: loose slippery sliding controls. Example of a game with tight controls: Megaman games, or Super Time Force Ultra. If Megaman's controls felt like this, it would to this day be debated whether it was a good game or not, rather than unanimously be hailed as a good game like it is now. It would have been inexcusable and would not have been tolerable by most people and there wouldn't be as many Megaman's as there are now. Period."

You play as a ninja warrior who wants to kill things. I'm totally 300% sure that's the story. You can read the story in comic book form in-game. I couldn't pull myself away from the actual gameplay for long enough to see that option in the main menu, though.This game moves so fast (or, at least, you can move so fast). You just run through the tower killing anything that gets in your way and go for the boss. Simple, but very addictive.I should mention it's really easy to die in the game. Well, more accurately, it's really easy for me to get too complacent and reckless in the game. I died. A lot. I got the bonus lives perks really quickly (you can unlock them for dying a certain number of times in excess of 100) because I just died so much. I died because the game is incredibly fun to try and move through as fast as possible.The game has a good way of knowing where you're going to do something silly too. The game really discourages you from moving quickly without knowing what certain enemies do. Man, what do those fast spiney things do? Oh, they kill you and kill you and kill you. There's good news. Since you lose a life in one hit, it becomes of paramount importance to avoid as many enemies as you can... while still trying to build rage.Rage builds up by killing a certain amount of enemies while not dying. When the rage meter is fully charged, you are invulnerable until the meter depleats. This gives the player the ability to make a decision about moving quickly vs killing things to build up rage.After all the stuff I said about dying, I should mention that the game does deaths in a perfect way for this type of game: you regenerate where you are. While it might seem pretty obvious that that would be the case, it's important to distinguish this game from Mario type games. There are no checkpoints, but instead you can insantly revive where you died and even if you spend all your lives and get a game over, you can still rejoin the game where you are.The soundtrack is nice too. It's certainly no Bit.Trip Runner, but it's still pretty thematic and well done.The visuals are done in a retro-esque style which is a good design choice; it allows the whole game to be loaded all at once taking nothing away from gametime and player tempo.Overall, this game was an extremely fun expense of time. I cannot get over how well it was designed and just how fun it is."

76561198128034078,Recommended,224820,19188977,"Posted: 21 November, 2015",all,shino1,"I have to say, this game definitely deserves to be more popular than it is right now. It's one of the early examples of roguelite platformers inspired by Spelunky, but it is however definitely very unique and stands out in its own right.First, it's extremely fast paced. Games like Spelunky or Rogue Legacy usually expect you to be slow and cautious - here, you also need to be observant, but you've got short time limit to find a timer pickup or you die- so you need to think on your feet, judging what is the fastest way to scale dangers ahead of you without getting hit. In fact, it's very arcade styled - winning the entire game shouldn't take longer than 15 minutes if you know what you're doing, but the game is extremely hard so you will spend hours practicing and learning your enemies to reach that point.Second, it's very focused on action. Combat is meat of the gameplay, with a lot of depth to it - you are always equipped with three kinds of weapons and two special abilites (Zelda 2-like downstab and a jump spin attack) that let you approach any enemy encounter tactically. Platforming isn't too shabby either, since the game will require you to jump over spikes or swim through water, and you can wallslide, walljump, double jump (or even triple jump with the right item), super jump by crouching for a long time, crawl and glide.Third interesting feature are unlockables. Unlike most roguelite games winning the game on Normal difficulty isn't that hard of a task and can be accomplished in 6-10 hours - but this isn't what the game is truly about. See, unlike most of these games there IS a pernament progression to this game - unlocking new stuff. You unlock bonuses that extend your timer or give your new lives, but most unlockables are new weapons. This is also where most depth of the game comes in - you have plenty of melee weapons to replace your standard katana, including a baseball bat, whip or lightsaber; instead of throwing shurken like most ninjas you can simply get a gun, a boomerang or even do a Hadouken from Street Fighter; and replace your bombs with molotov coctails or dynamite that allows you to blow up the terrain! All these weapons have unique properties that make them interesting choices in some situations. And of course you can mix things up with Chaos Mode that allows you to pick random weapons every session, requiring you to adapt to new situations.Fourth unique things is level design - unlike most Roguelike games levels of the tower aren't completely randomly generated but tower is instead built from premade ""blocks"", combining best of both worlds - each playhtrough will still be unique and unpredictable, while game allows finely crafted and polished challenges and moments that only a human designer can create.Of course, by its very nature this isn't a game you can sit down and play for hours, it's more suited to short sessions. But I assure you, the bite-sized frantic hard-as-nails (but never unfair) addictive action will keep you coming back everytime you need a coffee break. I should know, as of writing this I clocked over 30 hours just from these short sessions.Is it worth its price? Being honest, I gotten more enjoyment out of this game than from Spelunky or Rogue Legacy, much more popular games, and it is over two times cheaper than them. It's not perfect - there are couple weird design decisions like Parachute bonus that slows you down when falling (a bane of speedrunners) - but you can literally count them on fingers of one hand.If you like fast-paced arcade platformers, you will definitely fall in love with this game.Oh! And if you want a glimpse of what you're getting yourself into, you can try the games predeccesor, House of Dead Ninjas, which is a fully free online flash game.http://games.adultswim.com/house-of-dead-ninjas-action-online-game.html"

Just defeating a different boss usually unlocks a new weapon or ability for you to use the next time you play.The music and visuals are decidedly 8 bit styled, but they are not without their own charm. Your ninja character beautifully slices and dices and shurikens all of her enemies into explosions of pixelated carnage (which you can turn down/off in the options if you'd like).Don't expect anything incredibly deep here, but there is plenty of quick satisfaction to be had, and the customization options grow the more you play and unlock new features.

Additionally, because you are DEscending a tower, there is always a strong sense of momentum, so the 30 second time limit doesn't feel punitive, but rather acts as a mechanical reinforcement of the play style most people will gravitate towards anyway.

,Recommended,224820,9329059,"Posted: 3 March, 2014",all,Chicken Dinner,"Super House of Dead Ninjas (SHODN) is a platformer where you descend down multiple floors of a massive building. You are a ninja with a primary weapon, a secondary throwable weapon, one bomb variant as well as another form of magic. The game has only one difficulty, which is pretty hard all on its own. The only difference between the difficulty levels is the number of continues that you are able to use.SHODN plays like other rogue-likes in the manner of games like Spelunky or Risk of Rain, where you gain new weapons, abilities and other modifiers by playing more and more of the game. As you reach the end of a section, you will fight a boss (some stages have up to two randomized bosses) who have a particular gimmick to their attack patterns. Once complete, you proceed to the next area until you complete the game.The game is a lot of fun, as it gives you the feel of a badass ninja through the game mechanics, level design, and the responsive nature of the game. The game runs at a cool 60 FPS due to its relatively low graphics requirements, and the controller input is also much more responsive as well. With this in mind, remember that your enemies also react at the same speed, so rushing down into the next room without checking the area is usually a really bad idea.Overall, the game has a lot of replay value as you are only allowed a single weapon, projectile and gadget per session. This will inevitably lead to a lot of experimentation as you find the weapons that best suit your playstyle or your speedrun attempt. Definitely enjoyed this game thoroughly."

I've played too many PC platformers as of late with slippery movement (I'm looking at you Spelunky) but it's very satisfying here. It really focuses on your reaction and skill which strives to make you improve. Very few deaths aren't your fault and the game rewards you for building upon your developing ability.The pixel graphics aren't perfect but they aren't bad either. I do appreciate that while it has the retro angle going for it, it doesn't fall into the retro traps of being overly difficult or intentionally confusing. That said, later areas of the game can get *hard* depending on which mode you are on, but the learning curve is never unfair.There are also a fair number of bonus features beyond the story mode. There are tons of unlockables, different weapons and spells, even costumes if you have the patience. I've also had a good bit of fun messing around in the level editor. While not terribly robust it shows how far you can truly push the game engine and your own abilities.The game isn't perfect, there do tend to be glitchy parts (more than once I fell out of the side of the tower) but overall it is a well put together and fun package. You will probably get more playtime for your money here than many other games out there."

A great settup for me that ive told to some friends is using L1/L-bumper 4 jumping, R1/R-bumper for melee (square 4 throwables since that is used the most besides melee but the rest are comfortable wherever u program them if u decide to try this) and the dpad is my favorite by far, so when u get this game or if u already have it try using both joystick & d-pad enough so that u find ur fav n same goes for mouse n key/controller trying to find which u prefer cuz honestlly MnKey can be extremely good when mapped best towards what suits u cuz u dont need many controls n u have that whole ♥♥♥♥ing keyboard to use, u can use WASD & right side of keyboard like N, K, L or something like that whatever is most comfortable, but ive talked way too much already, if u dont wanna pay go play it free n if u still dont wanna pay keep playing it free n if the difficulty seems to hard jsut keep playin trust me it really isnt n im a newb wit a  long way to go haha, step 1. buy the game step 2. get good step 3. become a ninja step 4. become a ninja in real life..."

Nonetheless, a wide variety of unlockables to keep you going at it.Some boss levels can be quite annoying, since you don't know how to face them as you haven't learnt their movement/attack patterns yet. Once you die, you will definitely be frustrated at the fact that you have to traverse the entire level again to get to the boss, and hopefully memorized the boss by then. If you didn't, be prepared to traverse the stage again.I'd give this a 8/10, for the nice retro graphics and storyline behind it. Gameplay wise, nothing game breaking.

While some situation require some contemplating, its the fast run through a bunch of obstacles and enemies that makes your heart pound, and succesfully running through a difficult area feels incredibly satisfying.The levels are generated randomly, but there are many preset rooms.

When you come back after a hard day at work/school and just want to wind down and cut some dudes. SHODN is a perfect example of how a pixelated indie game can become one of the most addictive games out there.This game has everything to appeal to everyone: whether you're a casual or hardcore gamer, you'll find yourself addicted to this game. If you like pixel art, then fear not, this game's art style is very pleasing. Couple that with its music and you've got yourself a pretty amazing scenario. The game in itself isn't too terribly hard to learn; a couple of hours at worst to learn how to navigate efficiently, and a couple more to recognize boss patterns aswell as enemies'. However, this is more than compensated for by the pace of the game. The ""Rage"" mechanic provides a good way for players to descend the tower faster, as do the wide array of weapons to choose from. Which brings me to my second point: Weapon balance. Surprisingly, no weapon in this game feels overpowered when compared to the others. Sure, some are more useful in most situations than others, but overall, you can pick the weapon that best suits your playstyle and make it work. The tower's randomly generated floors also go very well with each other. There are no floors who disrupt the flow of the game or feel out of place. The slower floors actually feel like a breath of fresh air instead of just something to ruin your run. However the randomness has its limits: very early on, you'll start recognizing floor patterns and know how to breeze through them in a matter of seconds. While some might argue this is a good thing for a fast-paced game, I can't help but want more out of this title. I love the game, but after playing a bunch I found myself knowing the entirety of the games' floors, and I just lost the amazement that was discovering something you've never encoutered before standing in your way. But maybe that's just me being too picky.TL;DR : Is this a good game? Yeah it's a good game. Should you buy it? That all depends on whether you enjoy the fast pace of these types of games. If you do, this is a must buy."

The game is hard and fast paced, so in order to master SHODN the player will get through a tough and unforgiving road.You start at the top of a mysterious and evil tower, full of traps and demons ready to stab the sh♥️t out of you. From there, you have to descend leaving a trace of murder and destruction, and always paying attention to the time. On you way to the bottom of the tower, you'll find lots of different upgrades, items and secrets which will help you progress through the game, as you die again and again. Let me make this clear: You will die A LOT, over and over. If you're not into hard games that force you to go through the game all over again when you die, then think well before getting SHODN.The game features over 10 different melee, ranged and explosive weapons, 4 different magic spells, 16 upgrades, 24 unlockable item drops, 20 different unlockable costumes, and also a level designing tool. It has three difficulties: Normal and Hard(Vanilla), and Ninja(DLC). The DLC includes 3 new weapons mainly focused on speedrunning, the Ninja difficulty, the One-Armed Ninja character and two new gamemodes.SHODN plays really good and smooth, and makes me feel like a real ninja as i press the keys on my laptop to descend through the tower. The game is really fast, and intended to be played fast. You're rewarded for killing enemies consecutively, and have a limited amount of time until an invincible monster spawns to kill you, unless you get a time bonus or get hit before that. The weapons are all fun to use, the enemies are satisfying to kill, and the bosses very balanced. The soundtrack can start to be a bit annoying as you play the game and, eventually, I started playing it with the sound turned off.Generally speaking, despite some rare random crashes, I'm having lots of fun with this game. Got the DLC after playing 20 hours of it, and now I'm completely addicted to the speedrun mode. For a cheap game, Super House of Dead Ninjas exceeds in its quality. If you love difficult and retro games, just go for it.Dankness Score:9,0out of 10"

Pity me and my poor time management skills, then praise me for my foresight.  That being said, now onto the randomizer!Today's review was one that I have quite a bit of familiarity with, though not necessarily through Steam.  Super House of Dead Ninjas was originally a flash game Megadev released via the Adult Swim website.  In that game, you play a female master of the ninja arts, utilizing various bladed methods of slaughter to plow your way downwards from the top of the tower, never stopping to wonder why you didn’t simply try to knock on the front door, or whether or not any of the various tower denizens would rather just let you waltz on by instead of offending you enough to cause you to split their skulls open with a melee weapon.  The Steam version is not that different, that is to say that it is still an excellent example of platformer madness, that it still has wonderfully easy controls, and that it still whups lots of butt.  The game is very reminiscent of the games released during the 16 bit era (hence the Super prefix in the title) and has definitely got the 'Nintendo Hard' difficulty thing down, especially in the lower levels.  The game does an excellent job of ramping up the difficulty level as the floors progress, making the randomly generated floors more infuriating as the levels go on, and with the scaling limited lives and continues, the game does place an emphasis on precision over brute force without making things inaccessibly difficult.  All in all, the game is one that you should definitely put time into, whether it be here or with the flash version.  A buy from me.Game’s Fate: Kept.  This is a platformer I can get behind, addictive, fun and infuriating.Buy/No Buy: I would support this one with a buy anytime.  That being said, it does have a flash version that is similar.  If you have games you want more, keep this on your wishlist till it goes on sale and play the flash version till it does."

This game makes me feel like a l33t h4x0r and I just know that isn't true, I can only beat the first two levels of super hexagon for crying out loud."
,Recommended,224820,29210918,Posted: 12 January,all,Wakisashi,"One challenging arcade game. Progression is slow, items and upgrades were key for me to be able to make it further. I eventually got most everything unlocked--except: no deaths during final boss (what?), and DLC options, which seem to give you some great benefits. Most speedruns seem to use DLC unlockables.It's fast, you gameover a lot. Eventually you get some things that help you get further, and you get better running through the random levels.I was actually very surprises to have beaten game on hard mode--even the second time--as continuing is not an option."

,Recommended,224820,3704360,"Posted: 27 February, 2013",all,BBQ Chocobo,"Really good fast-paced metroidvania style game with a really genuine 16 bit feel (doesn't just feel like all these devs these days who just suck at graphic design). All the levels minus the bosses are procedurally generated, so speedrunners will actually have to be good. Everybody who plays it is encouraged to play like a speedrunner with the rage bar and timer making such a frantic pace. Precision is important though, with some weapons more than others. Announcer is a huge♥♥♥♥♥♥ but occasionally says encouraging lines like ""that's my ninja!"" when you show em your sweet moves. Worth the 5 bucks easily."

It's a Ninjastic game where you will get stabbed by cultists in your first minutes of the game. a lot.But as you keep unlocking weapons and pickups (most importantly the ninja wardrobe. very important) it becomes so great to try new stuff and keep trying to get to the bottom of the Ziggurat, and try it without many deaths, and then try it speedrun. So they say: easy(?) to start, hard to master, hard(er) to stopI wish i could have bought the true ninja pack too."

The game climbs down a very tall tower, and unlocks come at a decent pace.  There is not much of a story or characters, but the gameplay is very tight.  I fully recomend this one if you like ninja flipping all over and kicking♥♥♥♥♥"

,Recommended,224820,34811032,Posted: 8 September,all,CountGrishnackhh,"The game's incredibly fast-paced gameplay is what really gets me to rate it a perfect 10. There's a timer in the game and when it reaches zero you'll be chased by an instant-killing wall-ignoring ghost that's faster than you. This feature effectively forces you to constantly move and look for time-resetting pickups.SHoDN's developers have certainly not succumbed to the horrors of most modern games' difficulty mechanics. Every single attack and projectile kills you instantly. All that differs from the three available difficulty levels is how many lives you have at your disposal.The controls are smooth and unusually responsive. Unlike the large majority of modern games it actually feels like you're in control of your character. There are no gimmicks that get in the way of your control.The awesome pace and the great difficulty combined with the perfect animations, art style and responsive controls make for an overall fantastic and unforgettable experience."
