,Not Recommended,224860,32674936,Posted: 23 June,all,Glengoolie for the best of times,"Bought it in the sale as I enjoyed XCOM and wanted a ""real world"" equivalent. £1.19 and it was still a waste of money: bugs that were noticed back in 2013 were still here and I was naive enough to think theyd been fixed. Voice acting is abysmal, almost paradying itself. At times its unplayable, as the game forgets to put soldiers in ""downed"" mode and out right kills them automatically failing the tutorial. I've been shot through walls, the AI stands in the open and then snipe your soldier in the best cover with a Makrov.  Utter disappointment, even 4 years ago this game would have been terrible and a waste of money.  As a fan of the Arma series, this game tarnishes its reputation and makes me ashamed to have even admit I spent real money."

,Not Recommended,224860,18859521,"Posted: 3 November, 2015",all,Whiteswart,"Turn-based tactical game about squad of 4 shooters, engaging in some minor conflicts across the world. It wears an ""Arma"" name, for it was made by the same Bohemia studio, which shipped the whole ""Arma"" games series. As it turns out, in the end it become something like unwanted child, which is not deserving to be left behind, but appears as burden to its creators and developers...I was very surprised when found that game already in my library while I was searching through Steam for something like ""Jagged Alliance"". I can swear I neither heard about that game before, nor that I planned to buy it. I guess it was one of those bundles, where I was totally distracted by one desired game, and others were bought ""just because"". Anyway, the Steam search machine finally highlighted me that addition in my collection, and I decided to investigate.So I've read the info about the game. Majority of the reviews up to this date are negative, but named reasons wasn't enough for me. I decided to give it a shot... Well, now I can say I wasn't enjoyed playing this game myself.What is good about it? First, it looks like modern XCOM Enemy Unknown for many aspects of gameplay, which makes a process of understanding game’s basics a really brief job. In other words, you’ll get by very quickly after the start. Second, it is a very fine usage of Unity engine. Game really looks great, especially when compared to the representatives of the same class, turn-based squad tactical games. And when we are talking about mobile platforms with Tegra technology. But that praise concerns ONLY visual decals part, not the thorough in-game mechanics. For that people of Bohemia really should take some classes before selling to PC players something with that lack of deepness.I feel I’m spending too much time for this project, so, let’s be brief from now on:-	Easy to adopt – considering how little content there are, once you complete one or two missions, you’ll basically see everything that game has. Even if you want a complete, with all achievements in your pocket, it could be done in less than 10 hours, depending from your skill.-	It is 3d game, with quite good visuals – and the fact that almost all of the best squad tactics games are from previous isometric era… well, as previous, it is not a “Pro” point, as those visuals are good only for mobile standards for modern games. At PC they are just tolerable.-	As we are remembering old games of this genre, like Jagged Alliance or Silent Storm, they are so much cooler in every aspect, so much deeper in every given pixel, and so much more capable to capture your time, that I really don’t want to go further with comparisons.-	As of tactical component of Arma Tactics, well, it is quite dim – and all because of non-competing AI. And if we are speaking of realism there… there are very little types (and models) of weapons in the game, and all of them are so short-sighted, that even sentry fellas armed only with sniper rifles – or they will be missing every shot in more than 10 meters! Yeah, guards patrolling with SVD, so natural as life will never be.-	Finally, bugs section. Community full of complaints about something not working properly, but I’ve played the game after two years after its PC release, and was able to make through all game missions without major problems. Well, before the very last one, Damned Dam. There I killed everybody, lined my toy soldiers after the truck, into the exit zone… and nothing! And then I discovered that there are two builds in the game, and I was able to finally finish the game only with “beta” build, because on the major build final cutscene was lost somewhere… Epic fail for Bohemia, though not the first and not the last one, obviously. From other, not so significant issues, I can call unfitted control, where I need to click many times to finally make something happen – like walking close to some object, would that be an enemy or just a crate with pocket money. Irritating, but manageable.Conclusion: while game is not a total mess, it is worth any interest only on the mobile devices. PC port appeared buggy and totally not on the level with the PC games of the same genre. Gold with achievements is attainable, yet I would not be proud with that badge. My mark is 5.56/10."

If you liked XCOM and are wanting more squad focused, turn-based strategy then do yourself a favor and go somewhere else.  The game does not flow well at all, no thanks to the poorly designed maps and an interface that leaves much to be desired.  Your men get 2 'action points' per turn.  However each AP is only worth about 5 feet of actual movement, combined with the narrow maps and you are left with your squad inches from each other at all times.  The game has clearly been designed with close combat in mind, but when your ""highly trained"" soldier constantly misses enemies literally 5 feet from him it just comes off as rushed and poorly put together.  Combine that with the terrible voice acting/storyline and the cutscenes where characters talk without moving anything, let alone their mouth, and you are left with a game that is not only unplayable, but not worth playing in the first place."

,Not Recommended,224860,11171362,"Posted: 10 July, 2014",all,linuxpunk,"A big disappointment. I was a fan of both the first ARMA games (played original operation flashpoint and ARMA 1 and 2), and a fan of tactical turn based strategy games, like Jagged Alliance, 7.62 high caliber and Silent Storm. This game will not appeal to fans of either genre, as is not as near as “realistic” as the ARMA series, nor a heavy tactical game. It’s more like casual tactics for the casual gamer. In games like Jagged Alliance you could shoot from different positions (standing, kneeling, prone) and spend AP to aim (a “snapshot” or a “aimed shot”). In this game you don’t have any of that, and can only choose form spending 2 AP or 1 on a shot, but no further aiming gameplay.The story is non existent. It’s just a straight forward army game (maybe the only aspect similar to the original ARMA series) against your random “terrorist”. You cant’ “build” your team, since you can’t choose your solders, and both the experience system (to improve skills) and the weapon system are very limited. Another drawback for me was that you can’t really build “random missions” like in the ARMA series, you can just replay the maps with different goals, but not really design a mission.It might be a good cellphone game, but it’s totally out of league for a PC game.I payed less than 2 dollars for it, since I bought it on sale, and still feel I payed to much.

Now I haven't played for very long, so take that in mind; I basically completed the tutorial and watched the first cutscene. Right off the bat the gameplay feels clunky, with an interface not designed with a gamer in mind; having to click on my character to reload seems a bit silly, but not the end of the world I suppose. However the graphics are lacking a bit, though I've reccently come to learn that this was apparently a port, and some terrible voice acting to boot. While not bad things in a mobile game, it does nothing to propell this game into anything successful; instead its relying on its name to get what I would assume was most people who played this game to buy it. I wouldn't mind having played this first on a tablet, where something this game would truly shine, however with XCOM, another turn based squad tactics game, you would be better of playing that, or perhaps something like Breach and Clear. So for a first impression of the game, I would steer clear, and do some more in depth research to see if perhaps this game would be for you. For fans of the genre, you likely won't find anything new, and I would only suggest buying this if you can pick it up for relatively cheap, or you've exhausted all other options, and you've modded XCom 2 to the point of crashing and corrupting all your files."

(I spent 11 hours playing it, after all - enough to complete one of the two available story campaigns.)  That said, it feels a bit incomplete...  only one weapon of each type to unlock, only a very basic selection of non-weapon gear, no advancement aside from raising scores on a few basic skills which boil down to ""walking"", ""shooting"", etc.  If there was a bit more depth here, I'd definitely recommend, but as things stand, the poor AI and shaky gameplay make this a thumbs-down.  A few examples:With 2 AP per character per turn, a lot of the tactical decisions involve guesswork.  A few examples of the sort of tactical frustration you'll encounter:""I guess moving here will give me line of sight to that exposed enemy...  hm, nope, invisible wall blocks my shot.  Guess I'll wait til next turn""""I guess I'll wait here in overwatch so the enemy will come to me, since none of my guys have good LOS...  hm, nope, they shuffled a half step and hit everyone - I guess that low wall wasn't really giving me cover in that direction""It's a shame, because this game is very close to being a great high-value squad tactics game.  A few quick fixes to gameplay, and/or some added content (more campaign levels, advancement options, gear, etc) would make this a definite winner."

I think it's in alpha or something because it says ""press Y"" and ""press X"" and displays buttons on an Xbox controller at times, crashes a few times and is kinda buggy so I'm not sure if they're fixing that but I can live with it.This is a tactical turnbased shooter. You can customize your 4 soldiers with one of four weapons; either an assault rifle, a shotgun, a sniper or an LMG, and they all work like you'd expect them to. You get credits after each mission to spend on upgrading the weapons or buying medpacks and grenades and stuff like that for your soldiers.I love this game because it's so tactical, it feels just like playing ArmA except everything is turn-based. You place your marksman on a remote roof overlooking everything, the LMG guy gets into a position with clear view while your assault guys move up and advance on the enemy, and then you just let it rip.Like I said, it's kinda buggy at times, like sometimes it's almost impossible to avoid pressing the melee button even though you're not actually pressing it (the button for melee is at an enemy's feet while you're close to him) and you end up meleeing an enemy even though you didn't want to and you don't have time to get to cover and you get downed. Stuff like that but they may have fixed it, haven't played this in forever.This game is like an 8/10 or a 9/10. Only reason that I haven't played more is because there's a campaign and not a set of randomly generated missions so it's kind of boring to play over and over again, unless you wait a few months before doing it."

The turn system, action points, and interrupt systems are all pretty standard but well implemented.  The level designs are OK and the graphics aren't bad either.  Unfortunately, all of this is rendered moot by an avalanche of bugs that make the game nearly unplayable.  Little things like:1)  The ""Continue"" button (which should continue your game from the last mission you were on) on the Main Menu doesn't work and typically just hangs the program.2)  Building a custom mission and selecting ""Random"" for the map type always results in the first map (African Town I) being chosen.3)  Custom mission type ""Terrorist Hunt"" results in the terrorist you are hunting LITERALLY DISAPPEARING OFF THE MAP, making it impossible to complete the mission.4)  Multiple bugs in campaign missions making them impossible to complete without replaying repeatedly and hoping not to encounter the bug.5)  Weapon modeling is nearly non-existent.  While the sniper rifle has a longer range and appears to crit more often, M-4s and SAWs do about the same damage at about the same range... with no suppress function for the SAW.Bottom line:  at $9 it is OK, but extremely frustrating.

Your AP at first missions are very limited, so your full range movements are to be thought carefully, since you won't be able to act if you move your full range (and that means heal or defend yourself). Not good for a first experience.3. Those controls! The heck!! The icons show over the characters and you can easily miss the command. That means, if you intend to shoot or heal, and miss, you're done.4. First mission, 3 guys, very limited inventory (your items are counted as individuals, not per type), against up to 7 that clearly can move farther AND still shoot at you! Pretty unbalanced and aggresive, to be the first mission.5. You can't see your enemies at first glance (which enforces you to explore the map), and that's good...

Detractions for weak graphics, and a few bugs/glitches (player is out of sight but can still be shot by the enemy and vice versa)."

Cant really say anything good, based on my 1 hour of annoying gameplay. Graphics: Cant touch this! No seriously there arent any Craphics options, and the game looks like it came from a tablet. Sounds: Counted about 3-4 different weapon sounds + 1 explosion. Think thats about it. Gameplay: Sluggish, dull, takes forever, dont know what counts as cover, camera angles? O_O Basic Arma ai, they dont know of your existence if you are on theyre backside, and sometimes they can see the grain of sand in your eyesocket. I really hope they arent wasting time on this one anymore."

I think it is worth it at full price but if you can get it on sale and if you like these sorts of games (top-down / isometric squad turn-based strategy games) there certainly aren't enough bugs or gameplay issues that they should keep you from adding it to your library. Just don't expect anything on the same level as the full FPS ARMA games.Also in it's favor is the fact that Bohemia still seems to be supporting it with occasional engine updates and bug fixes.I only wish that the saves between the mobile and PC versions would sync. (If your listening Bohemia: Please!? That would be so incredible! Or at least info on a way to do it manually!)

Tactically, I'd call it a poor man's XCOM. However, that would be a tremendous insult to XCOM. (And the poor.)Skip this one."
