However, it has a simple and slow gameplay with really boring missions.Iron Sky: Invasion isn't a bad game. There is a chance, that some fans of space flights and fights will enjoy it. But you need to remember, that it's a simple game that looks more like a complex indie game and if not for the movie tie-in, no one would have heard about it. The politics plays no part in the gameplay, the fights are slow and have a bad difficulty balance. A good idea is not enough to make an interesting game.I'm sure there are Iron Sky fans who will enjoy this game but if you like complex, tactical space battles, Iron Sky Invasion is not the right game for you. Overall 6/10."

The whole of the game took a fair portion of the latter half of the film - basically the entire space fight and Earth fleet reinforcement segment - and stretched it out without making it boring. The tone of black comedy and ""just run with it"" silliness from the movie is preserved, from the mission briefings with Madame President Totally-Not-Sarah-Palin, to the political shenanigans of the various national representatives, to the over-the-top voice acting from the various pilots in the fleet.The controls are keyboard-and-mouse, primarily mouse oriented. On screen contextual tips do show up from time to time, which can help if you go a long time between having to use a specific feature of the ship. The learning curve for controlling the ships is very short. There are some technical problems - while I haven't noticed any crashes or freezes, it doesn't like my graphics card and the mission briefing videos lag the entire game as often as not. They can be skipped with no penalty and watched later, it's just distracting.Unfortunately, once the tutorial is over, the difficulty curve spikes pretty hard; it's all but impossible for a new player to know what to do and how to do it. There's a certain amount of flexibility - if a squadron of Nazi ships makes it to earth it just applies a penalty to reputation, which is a score by any other name - but there's no option to turn down or postpone side missions, they get added to your to-do list automatically when you head to a friendly station for resupply and repairs. When you're running all over near earth orbit trying to play space tag with the Fourth Reich, something's gotta give. That said, you can buy yourself time to fight the smaller fighters and do side missions by taking out the engines in the big ships, leaving them adrift - but the only mention of this strategy comes up once during the tutorial on sub-system targets. It's very easy to miss.Having said all that, if you liked the movie, you'll probably like the game. And even if you didn't like the movie, you might still like the game. After all, it's a game that lets you fight Space Nazis. I'll repeat that: You get to fight Nazis. In Space. And who can honestly say they never wanted to do that?"

More on that later.If all of the following conditions are true, you will have a great time with this game:1. You have enjoyed Space Combat Sims such as X-Wing, Tachyon or Wing Commander2. You have an X-Box controller3. You do NOT have a flight stick (Caveot: See end of review)4. You grab it while the price is discounted5. You do not mind that it uses 3rd party DRM ""Reality Pump""If you have a flight stick you will face-palm at the missed opportunity and this will probably erode your fun factor of the game.The game's control set up is optimized for a 360 controller, or any controller that is XInput-compatible such as the Logitech F310.  Many features are logically crammed into the little controller.  No keyboard use required.  It feels like this game was designed from the ground up to give some arcadey space-combat fun to gamers who do not have a flight stick.  Marksman-like accuracy is not required.  If the target is ""close enough"" to your crosshairs, you will hit it.  No sweat.  The emphasis leans more towards management of your shields, weapon energy and missiles.  -as well as making sure you are at the right place at the right time.  When you are up against larger capital ships and targeting their various sub-systems, feel free to wail on them with your missiles.  Don't worry, when you run dry one of your allies will thoughtfully drop a box of missiles for you to pick up.  Did I mention arcadey fun?The game has a 2D map of the zone of space you will play in.  Pick a location then warp to it.  This reminded me of Star Raiders on the Atari 8-bit computers.  Whoops.. Just dated myself.The game is based on the movie ""Iron Sky.""  It is about Nazis from the moon who invade Earth.  I did not see it, but I would like to.  And yes, it is as tongue-in-cheek as it sounds.  The game has ""FMV cutscenes"" (remember them?).  The production values are small and the quality of acting varies.  Fortunately, the voice of the main character you control is well-acted and likeable.  The quips he makes when taking out a baddie will never make you cringe.  The graphics are quite good for a lower-budget title.  The outer-space skybox is very pretty.  I don't expect to see much variety in the environment as this is about nazis from the MOON who invade EARTH.. Not too much variety of scenery between these two locations.  I wouldn't expect the game to venture too far from this area either.I don't know if I will continue the game any time soon.  Why did I stop playing it?  Two reasons:1. At the very end of the 2nd chapter I hit a game-breaking bug.  Reading in the forums I found that other people have experienced this same glitch.  Sometimes playing the entire 2nd chapter again from the start resolves the issue.2. I got myself a new flight stick and this game doesn't support it.  Makes it difficult to muster the will to play this right now when I could be bringing hot plasma death to my digital enemies in other space combat games that rightfully DO support flight sticks.Having said that, I still recommend the game for everyone who meets all of the conditions stated at the start of this review.  You'll have a great time and if the game glitches out remember; you only spent a couple of bucks on it! :)EDIT: X360ce Vibmod will let you map your flight stick axis to the XBox 360 control axis.  I just tried it and it works!  So there is hope for games like these where the developer wants to force you to use one type of controller.  Check out a YouTube video on it here:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUAhkrZKsVsMake sure you get the latest version.  The one linked in that video is older and did not work so well for me."

The player should chose if he want to continue fighing nazi or he will join them to stay with Renate. So half of the game could be totaly different. The game could have big potential but developers failed.Two DLCs add some things that original game missing like ability to give orders to earth fleet or to fly nazi craft, but it can't save it.I would not recomend this game unless it sold with discount (like when i bought it).5/10"

I can't even point my finger on what makes the combat in this game enjoyable, I should hate this game given how primitive it is but I enjoy it.Another thing to note is the cutscenes, the closest thing they remind me of are the cutscenes in Red Alert series, they are corny, full of stereotypes and display a ""pornstar"" tier of acting ability but dammit I love them.

And even then the control scheme is bad. No, you can't reassign keys, so you're stuck with them. And no joystick support by the way, in this space sim.But once you get over the bad controls, this is actually pretty fun little space shooter. Especially when considering that it is a licenced game and the movie it is based was a huge disappointment. I think it was James Rolfe who said something like: ""A good movie makes a bad video game, and a bad movie makes a not so bad game."" Luckily you can skip all those live-action cutscenes.I especially like how the ships you get to fly look pretty realistic. Like that's how they would be when they start manufacturing spaceships in real life. And I think one of them is Normandy from Mass Effect -series.Just wait for sales."

,Recommended,224900,11173597,"Posted: 10 July, 2014",all,Crache,"Based on the movie Iron Sky, which is like Spaceballs + Mars Attacks + Team America + Moon Nazi UFOs + Julia Dietze, the game is pretty much only interesting if you have seen the movie and are kind of craving that little bit more.Keeping in mind that I basically got this for $2 during a sale and the $2 was free from steam market stuff, it's not bad.  However, nothing about it is worth full price.It's a fairly casual shooter with auto-aim and generic mission types.  It was designed to be a fully cross platform iOS/Android/PC release and it shows though it's quite acceptable graphically, being pulled up by the usage of assets from the movie such as the soundtrack, ship models, cinematics and live actors.It has live action mission briefings which are acceptably corny in that Westwood Studios way.Despite it having auto-aim, they manage to make the combat intense at times due to the number of enemies and incoming missiles you need to accelerate away from or dodge.It lets you redistribute energy to your shields, engines or weapons, which adds a nice layer to the combat.Collecting salvage in order to buy upgrades is a central aspect of the game and becomes more interesting as salvage only remains in space for a short time, so you often want to use your booster to get there faster.  This can make you give up shield or weapon energy to redistribute it to engines to collect salvage, increasing the risks in combat for a time.  A catchy mechanic.The keyboard/mouse controls are supposedly pretty bad, but I never tried them.  It plays ok with a 360 controller, though aiming is a little sensitive.The Second Fleet DLC doesn't really add anything of value to the game, so there's no reason to get it.  Meteorblitzkrieg is 20 minutes long and not bad for the 74 cents it cost, so if you still want 20 minutes more then there it is."
76561197998753817,Recommended,224900,9813239,"Posted: 13 April, 2014",all,wroot,"Worth buying with 90% discount coupon. Other than that the price is too big for this simple shoot em up in space game. It has nice graphics, but nothing spectacular. The humour and actors from the movie, but maybe too much humour (Madam President is annoying as hell :)). Nice acting, though all storyline is presented in a small video chat window at the top of the screen. It's ok though for a game costing a few bucks, not 20. One bad thing about dialogs is that they often run during the combat, so you can't really concentrate on them. And nazi general speaks German and there are only subtitles translating it. So you have to shoot enemies and read the text at the same time. Bad, bad design. Dialogs should be out of battles or battles should pause or something. Gameplay becomes repetitive fairly quickly, though sometimes you have to defend or capture something, but most of the time you have to blast enemies. There are several types of enemies, some are tougher. Some require to shoot at the right moment (like Zeppelins, you should shoot into opened docks, but they stay open for such a short time..). There is some strategy to the game, as you should first destroy all the smaller annoying ships, before going for the big ones. You should watch your shields and energy and transfer energy to shields, weapons or engine according to the situation. But if playing carefully you probably will never die. Even if you do, you will go back to the latest save (every major space jump creates auto save). You are also allowed to change ships sometimes and buy upgrades. Other ships are interesting and have different purposes, like Canadian bomber carrying nukes to destroy asteroids, but most of the time you will fly Dundee australian bomber. Another annoying part is that you have to gather salvages of the blasted enemies to sell them to buy upgrades. You blow the ship, you fly to collect the salvage and you do these hundreds of times.. Well, at least there is an achievement to collect 500 scraps and buy all the upgrades for a few ships. All achievements are rather easy (just don't forget to visit all the stations to get all the side missions), but one should try to get them on the first run collecting as many money, kills and salvages as possible, because trying to replay chapters after completing the game will make achievements glitch and not register.All in all, i was pleased with the recreation of the atmosphere of the movie (music, characters, space combats). Last mission was too simple, short and a bit awkward (to fly inside the big ship). The ending was shallow. But it was fun, short game, which doesn't require much skill. For the price i got it i'm satisfyed, and maybe even try some of the DLCs. One of them let you fight for the Moon nazis, and another one even introduces RTS elements of commaning the fleet.P.S. one can always try a demo to get an impression.Update: don't buy DLCs, they are total ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.."

First I am a fan of the film so the fact they got several of the actors to come back and do their rolls again for the fmv portions just brigns back all the sillyness of the movie. Second the space combat feels very much like it was inspired by freespace...though very watered down. If anythign I have to say this game only has two real flaws 1. many of the side missions given will appear randomly and are timed with no way to re attempt them with out replaying hte chapter. and 2, this game is insanely easy. As long as you are in range and kinda sorta pointed in the right direction you will hit your target. Other then that, See the movie first, expect horible silly story, embrace its intentionaly awful nature.

The acting is good and the characters stay true to the film, only bad bit is it can become repetative. All the ships from the film are included (I love the British Spitfire) and the Nazi forces are reinforced with new ship types. I would advise getting the Meteorblitzkrieg DLC with the game and get the Second Fleet DLC after playing through the game once, as it realy changes the pace of the game."

It even works on Windows 10. Music is great too, and weapon upgrades for each ship are pretty decent. Whats great about that is docking in order to upgrade. Docking is pretty fun, as well as the ship to ship battles which for game-play requirements you do not see a lot of. I recommend purchasing all of the DLCs with rest of game.

It's a simple space shooter, similar to the old Tie Fighter and Wing Commander series, narrated in the same style as the movie. What sets it apart from the basic cheap space shooters is the fact that there is persistence between the missions and the AI keeps fighting among themselves even when you're not around. It can be played in first person view but there is no cockpit. It supports the Xbox 360 controller but not a proper HOTAS setup.Definitely worth the price of admission."

Recommended on salesLonger version:what I liked- over the top,  almost nonsensical story- cheesy live action cinematics. (beware lots of Satirical use of ethnic stereotypes)- decent number of ships ( paying about 2 dollars I had very low expectations)- different enemy ships have different week spots on their hauls adding a bit of variety to the fighting- the overmap gives the game a bit of sandboxy field- I liked the designs of the ships very muchWhat I did not like:- enemy variety. I remember about 6 enemy types which is not too bad for a budget title but still repetitive for 7 hours- lack of veriety in weapons- upgrade system is linear and is mostly stat increase rather than adding new unique abilities- game play is repetitive- game does not explain itself well.

The game is somewhat entertaining to play, and it works suprisingly well. I do have some issues with the bullets and where they hit or not, but that isn't really something of a problem until you are some meters away from something.The game started off refusing to start cause it was sure that Steam was not running, that I tried to launch the game from inside of Steam, was apparently not proof enough that Steam was running, so after restarting Steam, it launched nicely.As I play this game, I just keep wishing more and more that I could get an option to join the natzis and rather help them invade earth and kill off these blasted incompetent leaders that send me around on monday errands in space while treating me worse than dogsh-it, the natzis does at least acknowledge me and actually want me to join them, but for some reason, my character seems to enjoy being pushed around on petty errands and treated worse than sh-it.... this, combined with the fact that I learned that Steam had stoped giving me my achievements after the 5 first..... gave me a pretty bad taste in my mouth.In light of me spending extra time in the game, doing everything to get the game 100% completed.... have made me change my mind about those 4€ it's not worth itand you shouldn't even consider buying it, if you do however, don't expect the world... it is what you would likely expect of a game about spaceships and moon natzis.Remember to skip every video there is in the game, watching them may get you into a loop where you have no choice but to go back to the start of a chapter to not lose the objective ( which is tedious at best ).If you still want to buy this game, buy it when steam is having a -90% off sale, if not, you will get legally robbed. Personally if given the offer to buy the game for the first time again ( with the knowledge I currently have about the game ) I'd rather light up a fireplace if i was cold, or donate the money to charity I were warm.( to set it into perspective how bad this game is, X Rebirth is giving me less issues than Iron Sky Invasion have, and X Rebirth is the abomination that killed off the entire community for the X Series, and I'd rather buy X Rebirth again if I had to choose between the two )( and if anyone wonders, I kinda liked the movie, in a way that it was so horribly bad that it was entertaining to watch )"

An armada of Fourth Reich ships, built in secret at a hidden base on the moon, descends upon the Earth to rain terror and destruction.But this is not done without resistance. A cadre of crack space pilots have stepped forth to defend Mother Earth from becoming the new Fatherland of this twisted regime. A lone pilot, entering the hangar to see three state-of-the-art, prototypes ships awaiting him, knows he is the only one who can save Planet Earth. It is up to him and his brothers in arms to ensure that humanity stays free of the yolk of Nazism for good and all...Set during the main conflict of the movie, “Iron Sky: Invasion” puts players in the cockpit of an advanced new starfighter, to test his or her might, flight and dogfighting skills against the forthcoming Blitzkrieg-on-high. The main objectives are to defend Earth and its space installations from enemy attacks, blast as many Nazi ships into oblivion as humanly possible, collect and skillfully manage necessary resources, and make it alive to the final confrontation… where the ultimate secret weapon of the Fourth Reich awaits those foolishly brave enough to take up the hammer and chisel of heroism and attempt to carve their names onto the tablets of history."

You get to fly several spacecraft that look like they could have existed today in an epic battle against the return of the Nazi threat in a game that has stunning graphics (though those get old real fast), includes subsystem targetting (a must that seem to appear more and more these days), multiple weapons and upgradable systems, and with the expansions allow you to play on your own with no story line and control allied fleets as well as play as Nazi in saucer that seems to fall apart at the first sign of trouble.The biggest problems include crashes while trying to quit, leaderboard options that don't stop looking for a non-existant leaderboard and seemingly crash the game THAT way and buggy achievements (to say the least. Played out the game, which requires you to fly the canadian bomber: Canadian handshake achievement not ticked...).

What kind of dimwit skips joystick support in a space shooter??Now, it does have support for the Xbox controller for those of you that has one of those.What else is wrong with the game?Well, the acting is the worst I have ever seen in a game of movie ever, bar none. It is painful to watch.I was kind of hoping one actor would do something right, but alas.The only thing that really shines in the game is the two cutscenes from the movie. Almost gave me goose bumps.The only part of the game ""worth"" playing is the invasion, the orignial story. It is the only one that has some kind of narrative.The two DLC:s I got with the game was not what I consider DLC at all. They are just minigames based on the game.The first one lets you fight all crooks in a map and suddenly without any warning it just says ""Victory"" when you have killed them all.The second DLC was the only one I did not finish so far and that is because the only ""mission"" is to survive for 20 minutes in a huge battle, well, technically it is protecting zeppelins.I got this game at a 80% sale and I still do not recommed it.

This is, there is a big map where you can in real time choose where to warpthis is fundamental, as you are expected to protect earth while completing your main objectivesthere are side quests too, but they require you to stop by a space station (warp close to it is enough) to start the dialogue with each nation, so if you don't stop by them you'll miss out thoseEDIT:after reading many negative reviews, let me make some points staright- upgrades are ""expensive"": well, they are at mission 1, but trust me, once you get doing missions and collecting salvage (they sell at a fairly low price, but their drop rate increases sharply in o time, and big vessels drop from 3 toup to 15, so well, there's that), there is no problem. After long battles which happen to be a mission objective you'll end up with more than enough to buy a few (maybe 4 or 5) upgrades. Considering that you have 2 ""full time"" ships (the rest being temporary for certain chapters), i think that's pretty fair- combat is difficult: as i said, the game is not easy enough taht you can just stay stationary and shoot enemies. It requires you to keep a good micro on your energy, and transfer energy from engines to weapons or shield or from weapons to shields, or whatever you need, all the time. If you think you got blown up ""for no reason"", let me iluminate you (let this be word of advice): capital ships, frigates, and some fighters shoot missiles. Some are guided, which you can dismiss with flares(kepp an eye on the count, they are limited and you need to recharge them at a station or with an ammo box). But some are not guided, and these are the most dangerous, because there is no warning that they are coming. Most of the time they will blown up most of your shield and hull, and if you happen to be in a fight with already low shields and/or hull, well, bad news my friend. Remember, always keep an eye out on capital ships BIG cannons, they do very high damage too, so you should prioritize them before attempting to destroy the rest of the subsystems"

It's not that detailed, the missions are the typical, shoot this and that. But that is where it captured me actually. I like the simplicity of it and I guess  anything that involves space ships and shooting asteroids is always fun. The graphics is pretty decent and the soundtrack is pretty intriguing. Intriguing in the sense that they incorporated a ""space-like"" theme on it, throw in a couple of beats and dub step mixes. It's actually pretty decent in the ears. The missions are pretty absurd sometimes but overall it's ok, I like the simplicity. The cutscenes, well, not full cutscenes but you'll get like a comm interface where you'll get your missions from live actors are pretty well acted. Actors looks like they know the characters they are portraying and they look like they enjoyed it. The game overall is more aimed to fun and not of a space sim not saying that space sims ain't fun.

Me neither, but I was pleasantly surprised by this game. First, I'd like to say that I got a copy for only $1.99 using a coupon I received in the Steam Market. Second, upon getting a copy I learned that the game coincides with the movie ""Iron Sky"". I watched the movie before beginning the game in order to get a better understanding of the plot. The first few minutes were kind of bad, but once I realized it was a comedy more than anything, I was sold. So I went into the game understanding that the plot was meant to be a joke. That aside, the flight mechanics are really good (I played using a Dual Shock 4) other than my ship got stuck on the hulls of much larger ships from time to time, but only if I actually impacted the ship, and it wasn't hard to break out of. The music gets a little repetitive as there aren't that many tracks, but I tended not to notice that too much. The game's weakest point is by far the sub-par acting of the foreign diplomats during the live-action cut-scenes (again watching the movie helps). On the other hand, the game's strongest point is assaulting the space Zeppelins and other capital ships. All-in-all if you like flight simulators, killing Nazis, and can get a copy of this on sale, then it's probably worth your time."

For these game for 6 reasons I am giving a big NO recommendation.Firstof all: NO SAVE GAME. Only on some occassions the game saves it self but nothing more. If for any reason you want to urguntly leave  the game you will lose any progressSecond: About the achievement now. The game some times seems to become corrupted and won't give achievemnts (medals). The first time I ve played the campaign I ve earned 27/30 achievemnts, and when I ve replayed (many times) the campaign to earn the rest 3, the game is not giving them.Third: Campaign is fun just at the first time. After the second time it's boring. No different parametrs. Even enemy fleets are the same with exactly the same type of ships and exactly the same numbers. I ended having 35+ hours gameplay just because of the achievemnts bug (see above). Otherwise the game length is 5 hours for an average player.Fourth: Some times the Dundee bomber becomes unavailable in the latter chapters.Fifth: ALWAYS crashes on exit after a long session (usually if I have played 30+ minutes)Sixth: DEAD support. And I mean it. Those guys obviusly wanted some money fast. They seem they abandoned the game.

First or Third person (default is third. First is HUD only, no cockpit) with nice enough graphics - somewhat reminiscent of the gameplay in games like Wing Commander.Essentially, you fly around, kill bad guys of various types, and hit waypoints to unlock full motion video story segments.The space combat is fun, but pretty basic. There's not a lot to write home about here - which is a shame. A bit more depth would have absolutely MADE this.  The video scenes are...Well. The 'actors' shouldn't give up their day jobs. It's like the game devs went out of their way to find terrible actors, and then built a really cringe-worthy script around them. It's horrible in a ""I really can't stop watching this"" kind of way.If you've seen the Iron Sky movie, then you'll know what to expect.In short, I'd have to say that this is a fun game. I'll recommend it while it's on special. I don't know about full price... I'd say wait for it to be on special. It's definitely bad, but in a Sharknado kind of way."
