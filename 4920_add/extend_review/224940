This is where all of Nosgoth is betrayed."" ~KainThis game is the third entry of the Legacy of Kain series. Second, if you don't include Blood Omen 1 as that was made by other people technically, but the rest of the Legacy of Kain series was built right off of that game.  Also, I feel this is quite obvious but will post a warning all the same,this review will most likely spoil the first Soul Reaver game.After all, Soul Reaver 2 picks up literally right where Soul Reaver 1 left off, converting the final dialogue between Raziel and Kain of 1 into 2's CGI prologue scene. Kain escapes Raziel's reach by using the time streaming chamber to escape to a much less desolated version of Nosgoth in the past. But Raziel, still the faithful servant of the being only known as the Elder God who ordered him to assassinate Kain at the very beginning of Soul Reaver 1, follows him into the portal fearlessly armed with the Wraith Blade. And then, he meets Moebius. Moebius is a more than dubious character, one which Raziel is rightly suspicious of. Moebius, similar to Raziel's master, the Elder God, pushes him towards executing Kain.It doesn't take long for Raziel to gain the ire of both of them. As Raziel encounters the Kain that fled from him not too long after meeting Moebius at the Pillars of Nosgoth and does not kill him. Instead, Kain asks him to witness this pivotal moment of Nosgoth's history: the Corruption of the Pillars. After all, they walk in the first Blood Omen's era, about 30 years before Kain is presented with the choice he is given at the end of the first Blood Omen. Either die as the last vampire and thus bring about the extinction of his race, or allow the pillars to begin to collapse entirely, bringing about the apocalyptic version of Nosgoth you travel through in the first Soul Reaver. Kains tell Raziel to unearth his destiny, and then leaves. And thus, in Soul Reaver 2, you are no longer chasing Kain to assassinate him as Moebius and the Elder God seem so determined, but instead, travel through Nosgoth in several different eras, learning more about your past as a human, the Soul Reaver, and your destiny. There's quite a bit of time traveling in store for you, keep in mind this advice: ""History abhors a paradox.""Following in Soul Reaver 1's foosteps, Soul Reaver 2 is another action adventure game. The combat and graphics have obviously been improved quite a bit. However, as I said in my Soul Reaver 1 review, it's important to have reasonable expectations. I had less issues with Soul Reaver 2 than I did with Soul Reaver 1, less flickering textures, I could use a 360 controller without installing a program such as Xpadder or something. Still, even Soul Reaver 2 is still almost like fourteen years old. I did have a few crashes, lessso than Soul Reaver 1, but unlike in Soul Reaver 1, you cannot just save anywhere. So if it does crash before you can save, you probably will have to repeat things you've already done. Also, I cannot verify if it'll work on Windows 8 or anything like that. Personally, I played on Windows 7 and it was fine.The combat has been updated from Soul Reaver 1 and is in general different. In Soul Reaver 1, often, you found yourself doing your damndest to avoid getting hit because that mean you would lose the Wraith Blade, and if that happened, you would have to either throw your enemy into a fire, pool of water, or into the sunlight to kill them because after all, the majority of enemies in the game were vampiric. In Soul Reaver 2, the most common enemy you'll be fighting will be the Sarafan (humans), these weird creatures made of darkness that appear in parts, and hellish demons that will actually follow you into the Spirit Realm if they knock you into that (that's right, they added enemies actually capable of removing the ""no stakes"" element of the Spirit Realm). Additionally, while the Wraith Blade still works the way it did in Soul Reaver 1 for a bit in the beginning of Soul Reaver 2 (you keep the wraith blade until you get hit), not long into the prologue, the rules are changed when the Wraith Blade actually meets the past version of itself, the Soul Reaver. The Wraith Blade actually gains a will of its own. The Wraith Blade had always been a soul consuming spirit bound to Raziel and before then, trapped in the Soul Reaver itself, but now it was fully awake. Basically, what this means is, you won't lose the Wraith Blade anymore if you get hurt, but the more you use it, the more a little a ring will fill around your health. If it becomes full, I believe your health will actually begin to drop, although, I'm not too sure. To be honest, I was always mindful of how much I used the Wraith Blade because of this. Plus, I also just used the other weapons you could get from Sarafan and the sort.The Spirit Realm remains in Soul Reaver 2, and to be honest, while it's still cool in Soul Reaver 2, I preferred the way it looked in Soul Reaver 1. You maintain most of the abilities you gained from killing your vampiric brothers in Soul Reaver 1, such as phasing through barred barriers and certain doors in the Spirit Realm, climbing certain walls in the Material Realm, actually being able to swim without being immediately sent to the Spirit Realm/basically falling apart (you're essentially a walking corpse after all)... and etc. Where as in Soul Reaver 1 your goal was to kill off your vampiric brothers and then kill Kain, in Soul Reaver 2, you'll find your goal is more along the lines of finding elemental forges to imbue the Reaver with various different elements, along the lines of fire, darkness, light, air, and etc. As there are numerous doors that are locked unless you possess a certain element, and most of these places contain knowledge about things you want to know more about. Plus, you're already there, why not explore a less ruined Nosgoth that isn't infested with vampire spiders? Admittedly, I preferred the boss battles to the forges but... the one final ""boss battle"" this game does have is awesome for story reasons.There's less of this in Soul Reaver 2, but as in the first, if you're stuck and it seems there's no way to progress, enter the Spirit Realm. And also, if you find the enemies that will pursue you into the Spirit Realm if they beat you annoying when they start showing up, it seemed to me that they were actually easier to kill in the Spirit Realm. So keep that in mind. Also, another improvement in the transition to Soul Reaver 2. There's still puzzles, but almost zero block puzzles. Hoorah! Although... there is one thing I was sort of bummed out by. Soul Reaver 1 was linear sure, but it didn't feel that way. There were side areas you could explore, you could save anywhere... but SR2, BO2, and Defiance are all on a checkpoint system. They're still good, but the Nosgoth you explore in SR1's probably my personal favorite.As it was with Soul Reaver 1, I definitely recommend this game. The gameplay's certainly improved from Soul Reaver 1, and everything else (the story, the atmosphere, the voice acting, and the music) continue to be excellent. As long as you appreciate old games, yes, absolutely play this game/series. After SR2, only Blood Omen 2 and Defiance remain... and also Nosgoth, I guess. I'd recommend playing Blood Omen 2 between this game and Defiance. Defiance should be the final note you finish playing LoK on, not BO2 for... reasons I'll go into in my inevitable BO2 review.tl;dr: Absolutely. Legacy of Kain, in the words of the Elder God, ""you are worthy.""7.8/10."

Raziel has plunged through the Chronoplast time portal in his relentless pursuit of Kain and must unearth the mysteries of Nosgoth's ancient races as he travels unabashedly through eras of both the past and the future. Soul Reaver 2 has more in-depth puzzles and improved weapon enhancements, it also introduces a number of elemental mechanics, as well as an increased number of enemies.As with the original Soul Reaver the bigger focus of this game is the puzzles and these have been much improved and far more challenging. You travel to these various dungeons and you will find far fewer block puzzles and instead a large variety of puzzles that use the differences in landscape between spectral and real realms, reflections, wind, light and elemental reaver attributes. As you progress the game you will receive temporary imbuements to the soul reaver for various elements. These give the reaver various abilities and these are used for the majority of puzzles in the game.The Story is where the game really shines. The story is so complicated and well written that it spans five games. It is hard to explain the story, you just have to play the games to understand it.The voice acting is awesome. It is one of the best you will find in any game out there. The music as well is very good, you will find yourself hearing it in your head long after you played this game.The graphics are great for the time. The graphics now are quite decent, less glitches and more enjoyable lightning sprites. They made Nosgoth's appearance more lively and a better transition effect from Spectral Realm to Material Realm than the first one. Raziel and the other characters were well designed.The unique play mechanics of Soul Reaver 2, as well as its impressive graphics and excellent story, make it easy to recommend to fans of action or adventure games.Sounds 9/10Graphics 8/10Gameplay 9/10Atmosphere 10/10If you liked my review, please feel free to follow me and/or my curator group:http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ov3RT4K3R/myworkshopfiles/?section=guideshttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/orcollective#curationAlso feel free to check out my YouTube Channel:https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC83DYCmrWfl9ttrhX54jmWA"

That is, depending on your system, terribly.Lots of people have problems with random freezes during cutscenes, which is a pain since save points are often an hour or so apart and you can't even skip cutscenes you've already seen.The localized versions of this game, while they exist and are generally considered good quality, are simply not available on Steam. This is English only, and worst of all, this game comes from a time when not having any kind of subtitles was acceptable (way to do accessibiility, by the way).I don't care how old this game is. If you are republishing it, you have to do basic support. Why are we still paying for it if not this?Update on this : So it appears the frequent freezes are related to processor affinity in multiple core systems (most modern PCs). There are workarounds, none of which are very convenient for end-users. This could be fixed somewhat easily for everyone if Square Enix had any care. For this reason, and for the non-inclusion of versions other than English, I still don't recommend it."

You cannot comprehend the magnitude, the rapture or the tragedy of this moment. And yet you must; if Nosgoth is to be dragged from the wreckage of it's damnation.""As stated elsewhere in these reviews, Soul Reaver 2 has the quality of story and voice acting that is God-tier.  It's epicness has been unrivavled, in my estimation, since it's inception several years ago. No story in video-games holds such weight that that of the Legacy of Kain series. This, imo, is the pinnacle of the story-telling in this series, from beginning to end. The twists and turns along with revelatory epiphonies that follow Raziel in his quest for the Truth are in no way, in any sense of the imagination, trivial.History and time-travel also make their appearance here in a way that you've likely not fathomed possible, given the ""Back to the Future"" esque sense of time-travel most of modern media is inundated with. History, in particular, is a character in the story that can and will take action in the need to preserve continuity, a stunning inclusion and narrative-defining element. I'll not spoil the details here but the rules this universe are bound by are unique and very concievable, lending credence to the overal arc of this tale.The voice acting is a remarkable feat in this game. Most games have solitary actors being cued up for their lines, leaving much to be desired in the natural ebb and flow of a genuine conversation; often stilted and jarring given that actors simply have to pretend they are talking with someone else when giving their lines. Not here. Every scene of dialogue has actors standing side-by-side in a sound booth, bouncing line after line off one another in such a way you would beleive these characters to be rea not only in their solidity but also in their convictions. Truly an example of a byegone era of voice acting. Unparralleled. A treat to be savored, for sure.If you've never experienced the joy of Soul Reaver, I would implore you to either buy the game and play it (though the combat and platforming are a little dated by todays standards, the puzzles are fun though) or watch the movies of them online, starting with either the first soul reaver or the first legacy of Kain entry. It's hard to wrap your head around at first because there is much context to the story but once you get to this entry you are simply hooked.There's nothing like this entry in all of the video games that I've ever played. Do yourself a favor and sink your teeth into it. You won't be disappointed"

This version of the game is a direct-to-PC port, and comes with the wide variety of accompanying bugs. The Ethereal Plane and water physics are completely broken, for one, rendering the game very nearly unplayable before you even leave the Cathedral you start the game in. If you want to 100% the game, forget about it. I honestly got frustrated trying to explore the first underwater area you come across at the first save point. I recently reloaded the game after several months, and remembered why I hadn't played for so long. That said, if this game is anything like the first, there will be a point that the game becomes completely unpassable due to some puzzle or another not working the way it should. I personally never got that far. I vaguely remember playing the game start to finish when it was first released back on PS2, and I wasn't nearly as clever as I am now, what with being far younger at the time, so I doubt I had the issues I'm seeing now.TL;DR Get the game for PS2 if you're going to buy it, because console devs have once more dicked the PC port."

For a game that was originally released on console, this is unacceptable.Second, and most importantly, the game crashes quite frequently, and considering save points are scarce and the (quite long) cut scenes cannot be skipped, this is *incredibly* frustrating. Also, you have to enable vsync on your graphic card because the screen tearing is monstrous. Audio bugs are also occasionally present, though not to the level of the first game.I would only recommend the game if you truly cannot get a hold of the PlayStation 2 version at all. PS2 owners, don't bother with double-dipping for the convenience of Steam or the high res or whatnot, and especially not to support the publishers, because they don't deserve your money for this lame cashgrab.The game itself is quite good, however. Its graphics aged really well and look very good under modern resolutions, the story and voice acting and atmosphere are as compelling as ever, and the level design is spectacular. The camera isn't perfect, it's rather dated, but it helps to bind it on the right analog stick if you can. Combat, similarly to the camera, is both a bit dated yet serviceable enough, and impaling and beheading enemies still feel satisfying.It's too bad this PC port is so shoddy; no effort whatsoever has been made to make it stable and controller-friendly. This game deserves better than a less-than-mediocre port. I bought this in the LoK bundle during a sale at quite a good price, and I still feel ripped off.

And overall this is a good game that combines combat and puzzles in the various time periods of Nosgoth. This time around the game is less difficult but still keeps it's challenge. The game keeps the mechanic of shifting between physical and spectral realm. Although the return to the physical realm is a bit changed. So if you die in the physical world you shift to the spectral one. There is a rather visible lack of good/epic boss fights in this sequel and while it does make sense story-wise I have to say it takes away from the gameplay a bit. The story and narrative, reasons why I love this series, remain superb. The story telling is enhanced by (slightly) better graphics, the writing and voice acting are great as always. I like the soundtrack too. The downsides are that the game is old so graphics and compatibility are really lacking (though it is a lot better than SR1), however it runs fine on my Win7 laptop.

Your Soul Reaver blade can be used from the start of the game and is a bit OP, that however is countered by a bar which fills the more you use the blade and kill with it, and once filled takes away some of your health, thus forcing you to mix its use with regular weapons, which at least brings some depth to an otherwise humdrum combat system. Speaking of the blade, it can be infused throughout the story with different elements (light, dark, wind & fire) but disappointingly only come into play in puzzles; yet another sign that the combat is undercooked at best.-The overall pacing - This took a big nosedive since it opts for a completely linear style, in stark contrast to the exploration-based, open world the previous game had, sacrificing all exploration and collecting of spells / health runes & magic artifacts. Streamlined, yes, but ends up with a dull, empty-feeling world as a result.-The music - The songs are bland and unmemorable. Again, another point in which Soul Reaver 1 outshines this entry.Verdict: 6/10Mediocre, yet recommendable, however if you're a Legacy of Kain fan, you'll probably enjoy it if only to continue with the damn good storyline of the series, which is, in my opinion, the biggest draw point of this saga."

While the story in this game continues to be very engaging, the enemy variety is sadly quite small, and there's rarely a reason to fight unless you are barred in by invisible forcewalls.The eponymous wraith blade has in this game been re-imagined to be more of a kind of ""skeleton-key"" than an actual weapon. Although the blade can still be used to f*** people's s*** up, there's a certain game mechanic that makes this less desirable than using other weapons. I find the evolution of the wraith blade to be quite interesting between the three games featuring Raziel.While I consider this to be the weaker entry in the series (especially due to the complete lack of true boss-fights), it's still highly enjoyable, and sets a perfect jumping point for the climactic finish in LoK: Defiance."

It seamlessly continues the previous game and fills the gaps of the Blood Omen storyline.- The cinematics and the cutscenes are well directed and spectacular.- The voice acting is awesome.- The character design is brilliant.However, this game is awfully broken in many aspects:- It has good cutscenes, but it also has too much unskippable cutscenes that will interrupt you every 20-30 minutes of the gameplay.- Platforming and 3rd person camera are as bad as they were in Soul Reaver 1. This, and a ton of swimming sections can be infuriating.- Battles are frustrating: the challenge is achieved by making enemies enormous damage sponges. Moreover, they are simply annoying: most of the time enemies will flee from you / block you / charge-stun you. There are a lot of battles but you will feel the urge to avoid them. Oh, and the enemies are tend to re-spawn just behind your back.- Environments are dull, long and boring corridors. No exploration and no secrets. Not being such a big deal story-wise, they were the things that made the first Soul Reaver and the original Blood Omen one of the most exciting games.- The backtracking in this game has no meaning at all, but its amount is just brutal.- Yay, block-pushing puzzles from the first game are gone! Nay, mirror-rotating-and-pushing puzzles took their place...tl;dr: Will recommend only to die-hard fans of Legacy of Kain franchise.For others: just read the plot in some wiki and move on to the next game in the series."

Story begins right where it ended in SR1, in the time streaming device with Kain...Raziel emerges in another century, and begins his journey to uncover his destiny, again. Now, not on a vengeful quest against his former battle-brothers, but on a quest for knowledge, he will face many obstacles. You will open some ancient mysteries, and gain historical insight about the ancient blue-skinned noble vampire race and it's enemies. You will meet some of the guys that you probably already know (if you played the previous installments), like Moebius, Kain, Vorador... and some new.Some discoveries during Raziel's inquiry into his own destiny will be quiet suprising.This game is an amazing experience, from many perspectives. As you can imagine from reading my review, the story is outstanding.What about the rest of the game?Well, it's excellent, tooThe graphics are old and all, but you can ignore it, the desing and art in game is top-level, has a nice gothic feel too it. Overall looks good even today.Kurt Harland did a great job making soundtrack for the sequel, it's admirably written. Sound desing imbues the atmosphere with a gothicness and darkness.The gameplay is similar to the first game, it's a 3rd action adventure with enough of platforming and some nice puzzles. Overall, there's an impovment in most of the areas. Combat mechanics are much more fluid, same goes with probably everything.Recommend playing this game with a gamepad, it's clearly was ment for consoles, so if you have one, don't bother with keyboard (though, it's still playable, but not as enjoyable in my point of view)For all fans of the first game this is a mustFor those who want to get in to the story of this franchise, this might be yourbest choice. It's a bit easier than it's predecessor, more fluid and more pleasing to the eye, so yeah, could get you interested easier.Do strongly recommend this gem!"

Thankfully though my eyes only witnessed one single random crash during the first playthrough (yes I am going to go over it again XD) and it never occured later. The game itself is pretty well done.

The bottom line for veteran gamers is that you likely know what you're getting into for round 2: a freeze bug coupled with a horrible checkpoint saving system coupled with no gamepad support.  I mean, the first time I played this it was on PC with keyboard/mouse but this time around I'm really noticing how the autoface and combat system would be better served with a gamepad.I love this series.  I love it.  That's out of the way.  Unfortunately, this is the weakest link in said series.  Blood Omen 2 beats this game in enjoyability.  This game drove me insane.  Imagine spending 35 minutes doing platformer puzzles only for a freeze bug to stop you from saving TEN FEET FROM THE SAVE CHECKPOINT SPOT.  THEN YOU DO THE WHOLE PUZZLE THING ALL OVER AGAIN.  A lot of that.  A lot of jumping over and running past enemies because it just got old and repetitive.  The only driving force was progressing the story, even when it involved walking through the exact same map (oooh but it's in a different time, so it's okay!?) and dealing with the spirit plane and poorly placed planar portals (forgive the alliteration) and running down the same lonnnnnnng hallways because you didn't do something correctly.The problem is that a veteran gamer doesn't give up.  This game should be rated extremely difficult on the basis of computer glitches and frustration, despite how relatively simple it is as a game itself.  If you manage to finish this whole game whilst suffering through compatability issues, I salute you.  This was not easy for me.  By all means continue the legacy of kain, whether you're familiar or a newcomer, but if you are not looking for reminiscence or gamer cred, I recommend looking up a youtube compilation of all the story cutscenes, and moving straight on to either Blood Omen 2 or preferrably Defiance.I didn't recommend the first Soul Reaver on Steam because of a sound error that was easily corrected thanks to the save anywhere feature.  Praying that the game didn't freeze before I reached a save point had me ripping my hair out in Soul Reaver 2.  Play if you have spare time or if you just have to, because we've all been there.  We've all played the worst most frustrating games just out of the completist OCD'ness that accompanies our weird generation.Otherwise, please do not do this to yourself."

You progress through the same overworld continuously, only changing when you switch between time periods.

I'll give some credit to it, as the game was released almost 14 years ago but if you don't like playing with a keyboard and mouse, you will not like this. I tried playing with the playstation 1 controller, and a dualshock 2, but the support for them both are ridiculous. I also tried the 360 controller as a last hope, but nope, not working well. Despite all these controller issues, swithcing between the physical and spiritual realms may take up to 5 minutes, which leads me to alt+F4 the game, and play around with the compatility stuff on windows.. I spent like 3 hours playing the game, and another 4-5 hours to try to make it work..."

I have read on multiple discussion boards that it is probably due to the CPU cores or something like that. Either way this is unacceptable, I have seen many users with the same problems that I am having. When shifting realms the game gets stuck (It did start working again but it took around Five minutes!) Also the combat is just broken, for some reason when you try to attack the enemy you dash around them instead of hitting them. So save yourself the trouble and get something else."

More than anything though, I remember the cutscenes. Interaction between characters who would jawjack each other for so long, you could make a grilled cheese and a pot of chicken noodle from scratch (start it boiling anyway) and still get to see the end of the cutscene. Seriously. The shortest cutscene I can remember is near the end of the game and involves a short interaction with a large demon. It's about the length of a standard cutscene in a regular game. The long as hell cutscenes serve to explain a bit of the worlds backstory a bit and can give you the general idea of what the world is about. Sort of. You still need to play the older legacy of kain games to really understand, but they aren't required to understand this particular games story or enjoy the gameplay.A word of warning when it comes to the combat btw, you can lock onto an enemy while fighting, it's a bit janky but without it you're basically relegated to swinging wildly and hoping to hit enemies, even if you use a controller. In the late game with those demons I mentioned, that wild swinging crap does not work out. You must lock onto them or you are going to have a hard time. I beat this game several times, and most of the combat I did in ALL my playthroughs consisted of running in circles, ""jousting"" with enemies using the light attack and then running away only to come back and land another, single, hit and run away again."

Besides widescreen problems, the game runs fine at 60 frames a second.+The story continues and, like the first game in the series, it is masterfully written.+The puzzles are pretty good.+You can use the wraith blade whenever you please, which is very, very good--see below.CONS:+/- The game repeats itself a little too much. You run through the same areas at least three times. It reminds me of the hub-style gameplay of the first game, but it's done much worse. But it pales in comparison to the other issues.CONS:-This is the worse game in the series when it comes to the combat. It a phrase: It's broken. You have a heavy attack and can block now, nice; but the heavy attack is too slow to hit and the enemies' block does not reduce their health, nor does it ever break. You almost HAVE to use the reaver to kill enemies. The AI is horrible, too, since it will keep striking you without pause, not even letting a single hit in. It gets annoying when the enemies can both block everything you have and instantly 7hit combo you to death.-There are too many enemies. This game obviously has enemy placement that feels copy-paste, almost to the point that I wanted to stop playing.All in all, this is the worst game of the series, lagging behind Soul Reaver one, and bounds worse than much better Blood Omen 2. I'd only recommend this game if you want to see how the story plays out, but even then, you can easily read a synpopsis on this one (or just the script) and be fine."

The controls are absolutely stupid even when you rebind the keys, they still do whatever the hell they want.  Phasing between worlds still has the EXACT SAME BUG when it was on Playstation 2; being locked into place until you jump/glide, but you can't phase back out of the spirit world.  save your money period."

The voice acting is superb.The combat certainly feels dated but it's still pretty cool to attack using the Soul Reaver.

Most of the camera issues that plagued the first game are now gone (see, most of them, not all). Highly reccomended as one of the most well written and convoluted plots in history of gaming.

Really interesting storyline in the legacy of kain series, fights are ok, it has a really nice gothic theme to it, however please note that the game has compatibility issues. The only way to test it is to download it and try it out - do it at your own risk. For me on my desktop pc, the screen stays blue in-game. On my laptop, the character makes a 10 meter leap whenever he tries to fight an npc -> makes it impossible to play, unfortunately."

,Recommended,224940,33491627,Posted: 12 July,all,Crash,"This runs much better on newer pcs than SR1. I still got crashes from time to time, but they were very few and manageable.As for the game itself, this is a nice sequel, considering the story of the Soul Reaver branch of the Legacy of Kain series was dramatically changed just months before the game's release. It follows the new story that was made by the author and makes a connection to both BO2 and Defiance.Sadly, it's a really linear game in comparison to other games of this franchise. But an improvement in gameplay from it's predecessor nonetheless."

This is a textbook ""Linear"" game that is all about it's story and a damn good one.Soul Reaver 2 picks back up on the journey of Raziel, Kain's former top vampire lieutenant who had been condemned to a painful demise and reborn as a soul devouring phantasm. Unbound by the will of his master, Raziel had embarked on a quest of redemption and vengeance throughout Nosgoth, now rendered into an inhospitable wasteland due to Kain's selfish and parasitic ambitions. Hunting down his vampire brethren and claiming their corrupted souls, Raziel confronts Kain within the Chronoplast, a chamber built by Moebius The Timestreamer.Armed with nothing left but rage and his Wraith Blade, Raziel chases after Kain through one of The Chronoplast's portals, hurled through time into one of Nosgoth's earlier centuries of history and greeted by the TimeStreamer himself, Moebius.-However, While the game and it's story are incredible to play, this PC/Steam port version of the game is anything but stable unless you have a good card or program to run it.-Opening FMV will run black and voices sped up- Game will freeze within minutes and not respond-Raziel's Shift between the Spectral and Material realms won't function properly, which can be bad with certain puzzles needed for progression.-Swimming is very buggy as you constantly bounce up and downThere are discussions to get pass this, and if you do, then I recommend this game for anyone looking for a great story and a simple good game worth finishing."

,Recommended,224940,34377926,Posted: 20 August,all,AkiSmash,"I see reviews saying this is unplayable on Windows 10. Have no fear, because it actually does. For me at least, with no issues.This is a game I grew up with, with superb storytelling and voice acting despite its combat. Sadly none of my Xbox controllers worked for this, but apparently will work wonders with a PS4 controller. Only thing of course it that it will still name your buttons numbers rather than the symbol. It's common, and takes a bit to get used to. You also may have to mess around with the button mappings, cause jump was L1 at first- this game is picking favorites. There is also no widescreen option, but it's not a big issue for me. If it bothers you, there is a mod for it.I heavily recommend this game, and the Legacy of Kain series as a whole. Don't miss out on an amazingly long and interesting story.and ""how do i solve this puzzle"" will be repeated over and over"
