I Completely forgot how long and hard this old school advanture game is like.To HYPE up my self prepare for the new tomb raider that's coming out.. I decided to replay this.What an advanture! I did complete this game about 20 years ago and this time I did it in 1 go....When I solving those puzzle so many unexpect childhood memory that I have long forgotten flow back to me and that's a wondful experience.A Master piece and all time classic.However I can only recommend this to old school fan.since:1. Control is hard and less responsive and hard to manage then newer Tomb raider game.2. Music is good but lack variety of new generation of games.3. Graphics has aged quite a bit and younger kids now days won't like it any more.4. Have to save and load way too offen cause this game is really really hard and sometime there are multiple hard jumps. if you don't want to lose your progress.. Save Offen!Anyhow for rating...For old time classic 10/10. For modern day enjoyment 7.5/10

Each level feels like an entirely new challenge, both in terms of gameplay and in terms of fiction, it feels awesome. The fact that the game is beautiful, has such a gripping environment and protagonist is simply a fantastic coincidence that adds to it’s quality. I’d recommend this to just about anyone, once you get past the Minecraft-like graphics it feels just as modern as any game today, this game and its first few sequels are indeed timeless classics.9/10"

And all those 90's kids who played Tomb Raider back in the days just can't forget how they felt being this badass curvy version of Indiana Jones, roaming the caves, jungles and deserts by themselves, desecrating temples and tombs with two guns as best friends. Of course, the game seems way too easy now, the graphics are terrible and Lara has never been less attractive but to live once again these sensations, the thrilling chills when the t-rex appears, the little screams every time you fall into one of these traps you could have sworn you knew by heart, a good old merciless cold-hearted heroin who doesn't give a damn, now that's freakin' priceless!"

Once you do, there's a great adventure waiting for you under the clunky gameplay and the blocky aesthetics. The puzzles are occasionally quite clever, and some of the areas are pretty well designed.What the PC version does better than, say, the PlayStation version, is that you can save anywhere you like. However, this version has no music in it at all. Only ambient background sounds.If you like the Tomb Raider series, a nostalgic trip back to the first game might not be such a bad idea. Be sure to get it when it's cheap, though, because I have a hard time recommending it full-price unless you're a die-hard fan."

If you're reading this then you've definitely already heard about the series, so there's not much of a point to recommend. It's a must play category title with great level design and soundtrack. The game takes place in 4 differently themed locations (so it doesn't get boring), each location has at least 3 levels. There's also a free expansion pack called ""Unfinished Business"" that has 4 extra levels (PC exclusive).While TR is certainly not a realistic game (finding medipacks and ammo in tombs) I couldn't imagine it being different. You have to sacrifice a bit of realism to keep the game fun and entertaining. For the most hard working / curious explorers each level has at least one secret. Depending on the secret you may get ammo, medipacks or even a new weapon (early access in a way).The PC version isn't as good as the PlayStation version, considering that the PC version was released for DOS it lacks some features. It runs through DosBox, resolution can be increased but it's not the best experience. Everything is fixable as long as you're using 3rd party software such as Glidos. It enhances the game visually and also restores it's original audio quality. You can play it at pillarboxed 1080p without any problems at all."

However, there are a few of great mods available for the game which make it very playable on a Windows 10 PC. These files can be found here:http://www.tombraiderforums.com/showthread.php?t=214779http://www.tombraiderforums.com/showthread.php?t=217552Basically, with these mods installed, Tomb Raider 1 will run nativly on windows 10 with real widescreen, patched music and FMV's, high resolutions and increased draw distance and better water FX. HD FMVs which are higher quality than the ones in the link above can be found here:http://www.tombraiderforums.com/showthread.php?t=216973]An optional braid mod for lara can also be found here:http://www.tombraiderforums.com/showthread.php?t=209369.Gameplay: The gameplay hold up fairly well by modern standards if you take the time to adjust to the tank controls. During the game you will be left to your own devices to explore large open levels finding keys, ammo, health packs and secrets. exploration is this games strongpoint if you hadn't guessed by the title. the action side of the game holds up pretty well to. there is no manual aiming, just auto aim which works fine for a game of this time. there are many types of weapons to choose from such as the shotgun, uzi's, magnums and of course, Lara's trademark pistols. you will be fighting mainly wild animals such as bears and wolfs but you will also face human enemies sent to kill you and even some mutants which are still creepy even today.Overall, the gameplay is fun challenging and great for people who like games mainly focused on puzzles and exploration with some gunplay thrown in.Graphics: they are terrible, obviously. this is a 1996 game what did you expect? they were great for their time but now its just a mash up of blocky low poly enviroments and blurry textures. thankfully, the textures can be replaced with some HD textures and the draw distance can be extended with the mods above however, the blocky low poly enviroments remain. Also, the the FMV's look pretty bad too even compared to it's sequel Tomb Raider 2 but atleast the HD FMV mod helps a lot to make them clearer and sharper. look to Tomb Raider Anniversary if you want better graphics.Sound: Once again, thanks to the mod above we can fully enjoy Nathan Mccree's amazing soundtrack which previously wasn't possible due to the original PC port of this game not including most of the soundtrack. The music in Tomb Raider is very nice and fits the game perfectly.Overall, Tomb Raider 1 is a fun retro game with good gameplay and a great soundtrack that you can pick for a few pennies on a Steam sale. Recommended IMO. And also I promise this is not an ad for the mod I posted. I just happen to think it's really awesome and without it I wouldn't bother buying the steam port becuase what steam gives you is just a crappy Dosbox port."

You would just spend days exploring, getting scared when an enemy pops out of nowhere and accasually need to use a guide to figure out what the hell you are doing.

76561198142086942,Recommended,224960,16630015,"Posted: 22 June, 2015",all,TheArcadeKid,"What most people remember from this ancient relic of a title - fast approaching its twentieth anniversary at the time of writing - is an unassuming level called the Lost Valley. Ms Croft, far from the first female video game protagonist but arguably the most influential, runs through a short cave system not dissimilar to that of the opening levels, and gracefully swan dives into a pool from the very top of a waterfall. As Lara, you indiscriminately kill a few wolves, and then you find yourself in this expansive, jungle-like environment. The pitch black darkness above - the result of hardware limitations at the time - was intended to imply an outdoor, night time environment. It doesn’t quite pull it off, and you might feel like you’re still in a cave, miles underground, shrubs and trees inexplicably growing all around you. One thing’s for sure, though - you’re entirely alone.But not for long. Two creatures attack, on top of you so quickly you hardly have time to register it. You push on, hoping there’s not more of them - the earlier Tomb Raider games had a genuine fear factor to them, a genuine sense of vulnerability - and just as you’re about to pass under a broken bridge, wondering what might have caused such destruction, the screen starts to shake. The tense musical cue kicks in*, and then it appears. A huge polygon monstrosity roars at you with not-quite CD quality sound, and then it’s up to you - fight or flight.What makes this so notable a moment in the present day is that the Lost Valley was the third level of a fifteen level game. The Tyrannosaurus Rex does not act as a bookend for the game, or even for the level itself. It is not part of some grand set piece, or even an epic boss fight - provided you can avoid the damn thing’s jaws, a gunfight will last about twenty seconds, and yes, you can even beat the level without killing it at all.What we have here is game design from an era where things weren’t focus-tested into banality, when developers implemented outstandingly memorable moments without basing an entire game around it. A T-Rex in Level Three suggests a time when developers could, in short, do close to whatever they wanted. Dinosaurs wandering around Peru? Well, sure, why the hell not? Jurassic Park had come out three years prior, and dinosaurs were the next big thing in entertainment. It didn’t necessarily make a lot of sense for Tomb Raider, from a contextual standpoint or a gameplay standpoint, but somehow, it worked. And Tomb Raider’s full of moments like that - our heroine’s making her way through a mutant-infested Atlantis, complete with fleshy, pulsating walls, and then she enters what appears to be… an underground skateboard park? And sure enough, someone’s riding towards her, skateboard under his feet, twin Uzis in his hands, spitting out a remark that seem to be an almost-quote from Taxi Driver (“You firing at me? You firing at me?!”).These days are long gone. If you’re going to put dinosaurs in a game, dinosaurs have to *make* the game. You certainly can’t go putting a T-Rex in the third level. And forget murderous skaters altogether. You’d have half your audience scratching their heads. For better or for worse, consistency and logic are cornerstones of modern gaming - triple A and indie alike, I’d argue - and the times when developers could truly put an idea in their game “just because” are over. For those who can handle the archaic controls and dated visuals**, Tomb Raider remains well worth playing today. More recent Tomb Raider titles provide the same exotic locations and eclectic blend of platforming, exploration and combat as the original, but they often feel like you’re strapped into the seat of a rollercoaster - it's frequently breathtaking, but you're very much on a set path. For that reason, it’s the original 1996 release that has me coming back whenever I want a fix of the exotic, the surreal, and the often downright bizarre.Tomb Raider. Come for the dinosaurs. Stay for the gun-totting skateboarder.*Strangely, this Steam version of Tomb Raider seems to lack musical cues such as the one signalling the appearance of the Tyrannosaurus Rex. I’m not sure if this is my setup, but other cues, such as Lara’s voiceovers during the tutorial in her mansion home, play fine.**The Steam version of Tomb Raider provides the smoothest graphical setup I’ve seen for the game, providing texture qualities not far removed from late-generation PS1 games, or even early Dreamcast titles. Unfortunately, it also introduces occasional screen tearing, clipping and pop-up/draw distance issues."

,Not Recommended,224960,23776575,"Posted: 24 June, 2016",all,Sir Anoobis,"Legendary game, terrible port. Lacks part of the original soundtrack, the Unfinished Business expansion and proper controller support. Can become decent if you are willing to heavily tweak it by yourself. If you never played this game before I definitely recommend it, but I suggest not buying this version unless you get it in the Tomb Raider collection package or are prepared to take your time and fix it. Look elsewhere for a proper one.http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=118984427The ""port"" (if it can even be defined a port) is, to put it simply, inexcusably bad. Whoever worked on this has been extremely lazy and should be slapped in the face once for every diseased copy spread into the gaming community. Basically it's just the original game untouched and bundled with an outdated DosBox emulator. And that's all. No custom settings interface, no tweaks for modern hardware and OS, no proper controller support, nothing. So much for putting effort in your work.The software defaults to a 640x480 resolution, so low that it actually manages to make the Steam interface an hindrance, other than barely usable. It will instantly crash if you tab out of the game or use the Windows key or in any way take the focus away from the software's window. To change those settings you have to go out of your way, dig into your Steam games folder and tweak DosBox's configuration files manually, they just couldn't bother to spend 10 minutes and make a dedicated configuration launcher like many other games. Cheap-skates.The original PC version used to lack some of the wonderful musical tracks that instead came with the console version, and guess what: they didn't bother to bundle in the missing tracks either. They are available freely on the internet and you just need to copy them in the game's folder, but apparently this was too much for them. A plus of the PC version instead were the extra levels added by the Unfinished Business expansion, later included in a ""Gold"" edition of the game. Needless to say, they couldn't care less to include those extra levels either. Fortunately they are available for free like the missing soundtracks but you have to thinker a little to add them to this copy. You can find guides to do so (together with extra tweaks) within the Steam community guides section.Lastly, there is no proper controller support. Not only that, if you actually try to use your good old Xbox 360 controller using one of the many remappers available to mimic the original experience you used to have when you were a kid, prepare for the worst: the original game does not support analog controllers, the port does not fix that, and the Xbox 360 controller's directional buttons are, let's say, not very good for precise 4-direction movement. These factors combine together to create terrible movement controls. It is literally impossible to even walk straight for more than 3 seconds without mashing the poor directional buttons. This is actually a combination of issues and not solely the port's, but still, it couldn't get any worse and they couldn't care less to at least fix that.All said and done, this port is dogsh*t.EDIT: Got my hands on a Xbox One controller which has an excellent D-pad, enough to make this game finally playable with a controller. Port is still inexcusably bad though, and still can't recommend it."

The only thing letting the game down at the moment is...Controls - Not the worst I've ever used but I certainly remember it being easier on a PS1 controller a very long time ago.

It might be offputting to some, but I personally think it doesn't look that bad. In terms of sound, well there's no music.

The complexity of every single level and the abscence of a map drives you to think for yourself, and challenges your sense of direction. Puzzles are neatly put, containing subtle references to mythological elements of the setting. Combats are present only to add to the atmosphere rather than presenting actual action so far, but action element has always been optional in Puzzle Platforms for me.

But sadly however, the Steam PC version isn't anywhere near as good as it should be.Here's why...- It doesn't (by default) include the OST found in the PS1 version, and thus the game lacks atmosphere.- Game runs under DOSbox, which I find to cause some nasty game-breaking lag in the controls (especially noticable with jumping/platforming).- Doesn't support modern resolutions.- Cut-scene video quality is terrible.- Doesn't include the 4 bonus levels.- Didn't recognise my generic direct-input joypad OR my Xinput joypad (I had to use a joypad mapper).- Far too bright, and required me to use a third party tool (powerstrip) to lower the gamma, since there is no in-game setting for this.Conclusion : As much as I love the classic TR games on PSX, this Steam version is HORRIBLE. Sure there are community patches and mods, but frankly this game should be  much better 'out of the box'.This is a classic piece of videogame history and deserves much better treatment.

It truly is a Tomb Raider game, and the first of its kind. However it can be frustrating, mainly because of how difficult it can be controlling Lara and the camera not lining up.Graphics/Sound+ Beautiful, nostalgiclooking+ Nice audioI won't go too much into the graphics, seeing as it is an older game and obviously could not live up to today's games standards. It still makes you feel like you're on an adventure, and tombs still look daunting. It is an old game, so don't expect to be blown away by the audio or visual aspects of the game, however they are still pleasing.Controls+ Controls can be remapped- Difficult, and frustrating- Terrible cameraThe problem with Tomb Raider I is the controls. They are very confusing, and I suggest you remap them to the WASD, space bar, E controls that are common today. Traversal can be irritating, and the camera often isn't facing the right way, making some jumps unnecessarily hard.Despite this, it can still be fun to play. Yes some of the jumps are difficult and can take you multiple tries to simply get up a ledge, but despite this, it is still an enjoyable game.Overall/Quick ReviewTomb Raider I is a fun, nostalgic leap into the past where you can experience the game that started one of the best series in gaming history. Fun gameplay and interesting story, but sometimes the controls and camera can make the game more frustrating and irritating than fun and enjoyable.If you want to play this game, but worry about the controls and camera issues, being how it is older, pick up Tomb Raider Anniversary. It is an almost exact remake of this game, with better gameplay, easier controls, and roughly the same level design.Recommended for any Tomb Raider fans, old or new.Fun game that takes you back to your childhood.Buy it.MANDATORYSUGGESTIONS BEFORE YOU PLAYI highly recommend you follow this link, and do as it says. It makes the game less buggy, crash less, look better, and simply just improve the game overall.http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=127637434Remap the controls to the usual WASD to move, E to interact, space to jump, and so on before you play, as the default controls will feel clunky and difficult.Don't jump and then hit E (interact) to climb up! Simply hold E and W, and Lara will jump up and grab, and climb up by herself. It makes the game much less frustrating and easier to control. It took me a long time to learn this.SAVE AS OFTEN AS POSSIBLERight before a hard jump, save. After you make that jump,SAVEIf you fall you can simply reload and try again without having to start back from the very beginning. It makes the game far less infuriating and much more enjoyable.Note: If you do not save before you die in the beginning of the game, you will be sent back to the main menu and have to restart all over, including remapping the controls. Save as soon as possible."

Some levels were so big that I got lost a few times, made worse by the fact that there is no in-game map! Many secret areas are available as well.The weapon arsenal isn't really that huge (pistols with unlimited ammo, shotgun, magnums and Uzis), but it's fine for this type of game, which focuses on exploration more than shooting. Not having a weapon reload function also helps concentrate more on that.There are many enemies as well, from wolves and evil henchmen to raptors (and a lone T-Rex! Felt really good fighting it!) and supernatural monsters.As for the graphics, which also brings me to recommending or not this game, I have to say that they are good enough for a 1996 game, but, having said that, modern gamers accustomed to today's graphics will probably not like this (the gameplay also feels obsolete for today's standards).An expansion pack was also made available for PC (called Unfinished Business, which features 4 additional levels), but is not present in the Steam version, as well as the original Playstation game's music (which is a letdown, since the Steam version's in-game music is almost non-existent, while the Playstation one added a lot to the atmosphere), but thankfully I foundthis guidewhich fixes both those issues.

,Recommended,224960,24513627,"Posted: 25 July, 2016",all,TiffanyAK,"First of all, yes, this game does desperately need an update for new systems. I didn't finish it for just that reason. That is to say, the game runs alright on modern systems, but uses a downright bad DosBox emulator which crashes whenever the Windows key (or a few others) is pressed, which is especially annoying given the fact that particular key falls squarely in-between two of the most commonly used buttons in the game. One slightly wrong move and you've blown it. Also factor in the 1996-era computer graphics and controls (which are particularly notably bad here, as you not only have the all-too-common directional issues of the era that always make me wonder how we didn't pull our hair out, but also a character that sometimes downright refuses to jump and move in a given direction at the same time), and this game is particularly dated and as such is at times frustrating. These are definitely cons which, depending how you feel about playing classic games from the period, could be a deal-breaker.Yet, I do still recommend it for those who want the original experience of playing one of the best games of the Lara Croft series, and have the patience and ability to do so. Unfortunately, the graphics of the period are particularly hard on the eyes, so if you have vision issues like I do, be prepared for the possibility of extra strain. But, while it is old, it is still very much the game that you might remember, frustrations and all. The game is immersive, the puzzles and encounters engaging, and it simply feels like a genuinely death-defying Lara Croft adventure (though, admittedly, some of the challenge of defying death comes strictly from the poor controls) where one truly is free and forced to jump, climb, shoot (though there is auto-targeting as long as you're facing the right direction, or it'd be downright impossible with these controls), and dangle with the unforgiving precision necessary to survive. If there's one thing games of the era tended to get right compared to today, it is definitely the lack of hand-holding despite the inferior controls. This is a true adventure game.Overall, though highly dated, it is a truly great game, and one that would serve the series very well as a future remaster rather than the modern inferior sequels they keep releasing."

76561198087786691,Recommended,224960,30056971,Posted: 20 February,all,Tirah,"Tomb Raider is a franchise that influenced my adolescent years, and Tomb Raider 1 specifically is the very first fully 3D game I've ever played in my life. As such, it will always hold a special place in my heart. If you never played any of the classic 90's Tomb Raiders, you may be inclined to dismiss this game as a trainwreck with horrible controls and even worse graphics, but please - DO give this game a chance!First of all, do not even attempt to play the game as is. Download nGlide and adjust the settings. There's a helpful guide on Steam that describes the whole process ('Visual Improvements' by Xazuki). Tomb Raider is 20 years old and looks the part, but you can make it look a little bit better with nGlide. You may think that it's not worth the effort and you'd rather play the PS1 version, but don't do it. The PS1 graphics are horrendous and cannot be improved in any way. You can also only save at Save Crystals which makes the game rather frustrating. In the PC version you can save anytime, anywhere. The whole nGlide thing doesn't even take 5 minutes and makes the game look infinitely better. Keep in mind that the pre-rendered CGI cutscenes will still be interlaced and look pretty bad. They looked like this back then as well so don't worry about it too much.Tank controls: back in the 90's these controls were absolutely fantastic and for me they hold up even today. I still vividly remember how much I hated it when Tomb Raider Legend switched to more modern mouse+keyboard controls. If you're playing this game for the first time, you may need some time to get used to the controls but please don't give up and give this game a chance. Once you learn the ropes, it's a LOT of fun. The keyboard controls are really, really good and you'll play like a pro in no time.Keep in mind that:- Pressing the left/right arrows will only turn Lara in that direction, NOT make her run like it would in modern games.- There are no camera controls; instead, the camera automatically follows you and when you hit a dead end, it moves in front of you which may initially be rather confusing.- If you press both up and down arrows at once, Lara will do a little roll and turn 180 degrees instantly, saving you time.- You holster/draw your guns by pressing space bar. Once your guns are out, Lara will automatically target any enemy nearby. All you have to do then is to press and hold Ctrl until the enemy is dead. Release Ctrl and press and hold it again to target a new enemy or else Lara will keep shooting the dead corpse. The combat is simplistic and usually involves running/rolling around or jumping back away from an enemy and shooting until they're dead.- Until you memorize the level layout, it's useful to run around with your guns out. Lara often targets enemies before you can even see them which is useful. However, you cannot do anything other than shoot while your weapons are out. You need to holster them to do stuff like picking up items/unlocking doors/pulling levers/etc.- The levels are grid based which is very useful when you're trying to figure out if you can make a jump or not! When jumping, Lara can cross 2 squares and will grab onto the edge of the third one. The running jump gets you across 3 squares and you will grab onto the edge of the fourth one. The little back jump (Down Arrow key) is exactly 1 square long. You need exactly 1 square to do a running jump.- Pressing and holding down Shift will make Lara walk. While she's walking, she can't fall off a ledge. Walking also allows you to walk through spikes safely. To execute a running jump, walk up to an edge of a platform, let go of Shift, press arrow down to jump back once, then press and hold Alt (jump key) and start running forward.-There's no annoying automatic grabbing of ledges like in moderm games, everything is 100% manual. Press and hold Control just as you're about to reach a ledge you want to hold onto.- Shift + Alt is a secret swan dive move that gives you some extra momentum when swimming.- Jumping may seem a bit unresponsive to you but that's how it's supposed to be. Lara needs to run a bit inbetween jumps, you can't chain-jump like you would in modern games. If you're not sure when she's ready to jump, just hold Alt instead of pressing it.Tomb Raider is quite old and has its quirks, but if you stick with it you'll have loads of fun. The level design is still great even today, as is the music and ambient sound. The atmosphere can be genuinely creepy and oppressive. the voice acting is pretty weak compared to the later entries in the series, but it's not a deal breaker. Bottom line: Tomb Raider is an absolute classic that defined 3rd person action platformers. It's a game everyone should play at least once in their life. Don't let the outdated controls and visuals deter you. This game is still very much worth your time."

Starring one of the first mainstream female characters in video gaming history, and featuring gameplay designed around a Indiana-Jones style of adventuring. This is the original classic of one of my most cherished franchises in gaming history.Every level is cleverly designed to make you explore and the emphasis is on puzzles more then combat. The atmosphere in this game is perhaps it's most unique feature. There isn't much music, but a lot of ambient background noise that will keep you unsettled as you explore the tombs of ancient civilizations.One disappointment with this PC release is that much of the music from the Playstation release has been removed, which is a bit of a let down. This game is also hit or miss how well it will perform on modern PC's. The game is emulated using Dosbox and it may not always run correctly on modern graphics cards/sound cards without graphical glitches or sound glitches.If you can look past it's dated graphics, old-school grid-based controls, and it's clunky (but creative) puzzle logic then Tomb Raider is a classic game that I highly recommend to any fan of Action/Adventure games."

It's not really a contentious observation to say that the controls are completely awful, as Lara handles about as gracefully as a cow on a forklift, courtesy of her tank controls, but the actual gameplay once you get the hang of it is actually quite fun.One thing I quite liked about this game's story compared to the general perception of Lara Croft these days, is that for all intents and purposes Lara is NOT a hero. Protagonist, sure, but she's depicted here as a callous adrenaline junkie who is roped into the plot strictly through the promise of thrills, and sticks it through to the end basically just to spite the people who tried to kill her.I actually found this characterization fairly interesting, and was glad to see that in truth Lara does in fact have a personality outside of her bust size (which never much mattered to me, personally I think her most attractive physical asset would be her toned abs, which soften out after the third game in favor of a more generic swimsuit physique). Shame it meant so little to the developers and the public consciousness that each reboot of Lara might as well be an entirely different person.The game actually shows quite a bit of restraint throughout, and while you do gun down dozens of endangered animals throughout the adventure, the body count is much, much lower than an equivalent game made today would ever be. Your final human kill count by the end is SIX (or even five depending on how you classify the final boss), and even the animals you kill are largely brief encounters with one or two at a time to keep you on your toes - for the most part the game is content to let you solve the platforming puzzles in peace.The game's biggest flaw, as is a sad recurrance, is its final level. Tomb Raider's interpretation of Atlantis is certainly a new one - gilded Ry'leh isn't something I expected - but let's set some new standards, alright? Developers: you're not allowed to set your final level inside a colon anymore. I know you're trying to go for an offputting atmosphere, but it looked like crap in Halo 3, it looked like crap in Tomb Raider, it looked like crap in Half-Life, and it looked like crap every time it was done in Dead Space.But that's not the issue I have with the final level. The issue is quite simply that it's not very well designed. From the start I picked up on the feeling that the developers were starting to run out of ideas, with nonsensical puzzles that couldn't be passed off as ancient puzzle-based security systems, but it was around the penultimate boss fight and afterwards that cinched the deal: medpacks basically stop being a thing. I managed to get a pretty good distance without needing to heal through skill and perseverance, but in the end I had to give up and watch the ending cutscene on YouTube (since I couldn't get the level skip cheat to work).Being down to essentially my last sliver of health, the game had suddenly turned into I Wanna Be The Guy as every trap would kill me instantly, and certain drops became literally impossible as I couldn't even handle the minute damage from falling that far. I suspect this is a typical side effect of the developers running out of time or money or energy for proper playtesting and rushing the product to shelves. In the end though I had a lot of fun with this, even if I couldn't experience the last 20-odd minutes of gameplay myself."

What's more, having the Windows button between the Ctrl and Alt keys, which are both used for the keyboard controls, makes it more difficult to avoid pressing by accident. I use an Xbox controller to play through JoyToKey (shout out to the guy in the community guides for posting info and help with this), which eliminates the problem with pressing Windows, however holding the action button and then pressing the Inventory crashes the program, as I believe this is the equivalent to Alt + Tab on a keyboard, which has happened to me a few times for example while shooting and then quickly accessing the inventory to use a Med Pack.Compared to the console and disk versions, this game feels almost lifeless. This is because textures and lighting are plain and less efficient, anti-aliasing is terrible (for an old game you shouldn't expect much, but the other versions are still much more smooth than on this) and the soundtrack is almost non-existent - stepping into a room or area will not trigger music to play like it should, though boss taunts at the beginning of battles still some how functions. I've seen videos on the internet of people playing on the console versions (like I myself once did) and even people playing on PC with compatibility on a disc/disk, which has me to believe all of the above issues are because of DOSBox emulation.Despite these issues, I give it a thumbs up/recommended as it is by all means a playable game and if you're wanting to discover or re-discover the original franchise, this should bring back the memories, also garaunteed to bring at least a few hours of enjoyment."

No really, there is no music throughout the entire game other than on the title screen and cutscsenes. Apparently this harkens back to the original PC release back in the 90's which also didn't have music as opposed to the Playstation version.I understand it was hard to do this back then, probably because of the game engine or something, but nowadays this could have been fixed easily. That's my only real complaint really but sadly it's a big one. Because without music things got a bit boring at times, especially in the beginning.But it's still a good game, the puzzles are not particularly difficult but time consuming and the controls are devastatingly dated but I enjoyed it.

Sometimes the game can be quite unforgiving when you get to certain points but the PC advantage here is that you can save the game just about anywhere.  Just make sure to have backup saves so that you can go back when you need to.  I got all the way to the end and needed to go back a couple saves because I ran out of supplies and couldn't finish the last fight.  It is difficult, the jumping mechanics in particular are difficult to master and when moves have to be performed quickly to survive I often had to reload the game many times.As for this steam version of the game there are a few annoyances (that perhaps I could have fixed by modding, but I didn't bother looking):1) No controller support2) You can customize buttons, but the game forgets to turn to ""User Keys"" each time you start it, so you have to select ""User Keys"" instead of ""Default Keys"" every time.3) Fullscreen on a 16:9 monitor means that you have a black bar on the right side the whole time so that the game preserves it's aspect ratio.4) If you Alt+Tab out of the game you cannot get back into it, you have to close dosbox and restart it.5) Cutscenes look awful, sort of like giant scanlines through everything, ironically those scale to the full 16:9 format but just look bad.However, that said this was an enjoyable experience that was frustrating at times, it's amazing what such a small team managed to do back in 1996.I would recommend this game to those who don't mind the issues associated with how old it is and want to start where it all began.7/10"

I do this every few years with various things I liked as a tween, Linkin Park, being another prime example, before remembering that my 12 year old self wasn't actually that bright.That's not to say Tomb Raider is bad. It's just aged pretty badly, early 90's 3D makes Lara look like she's been carved out of wood and she always tends to be trying to merge with the scenery. Environments aren't much better, in the back of your head, you're always vaguely aware that the whole game seems to be built on a grid, (every block the same size, etc). So aesthetically it's crap, but how does it play?Moderately badly now you mention it. To be fair Lara does control extremely well for running around, making huge leaps, somersaulting and shooting. It's when the game gets into the second act and the fiddly jumps come in that the controls become a problem. If you, like me, played Tomb Raider back before the iPod was invented then you probably remember with fondness the screaming masogynistic curses you would yell at Lara as she dived into a spike pit instead of the desired ledge. It is not actually that fun reliving said experience.My final gripe is actually hard to describe. (some background) I got all the old Tomb Raiders in a steam sale and binged on them over a weekend off, (this is the best of the lot) and I started to get this nagging feeling. The same feeling I got while playing too much Diablo 2: 'it's all the same.' you are doing the same thing over and over. Theres not much game here really, just a series of levers you have to pull in the correct order. That combined with the ugliness and the frustration drove the final nail into the nostalgia coffin.Having said all that, it's still a great game and definately worth £4.99. The reason for this is similar to the reason I like similarly hideous game 'Deus Ex'. Because it's ugly as sh*t the designers could make pretty much whatever they wanted. The game is loooooooong, the variety is fantastic and the different locales are great. the game is packed with highlight set pieces, like the T-rex attack, the colosseum fight, the Sphinx, a statue turning Lara into gold, Atlantis city and a certain (very vertical) level in which you must pass the challenges of the gods. That's the reason I kept coming back to the shoddier sequels. For that sense of adventure I shared with a woman with an extremely impractical set of mammary glands."

But if you take it for what it is and compare it to games at the time it is one of the best games ever made.At the time of its release we has seen nothing like this, the graphics on both pc and console where fantastic and the game play and level design where fluid and expansive. It really did blow allot of people away. I won’t go into too much detail regarding Lara's history or legacy as we all know the impact she had on the video game industry as well as pop culture its self. So let’s begin.Tomb Raider puts you in the boots of arceologist Lara Croft who is approached by a rich and powerful business woman known as Natla to recover an artefact in Peru, and that is all that is know when Lara sets off on this adventure. The story on the whole is decent but It can be hard at times to piece together exactly what’s going on, I guess in modern gaming we are so used to incredible cinematic experiences that a handful of short FMV's and in game cut sense don’t quite cut it. The clues are there however and its a decent story that keeps the game moving on nicely. The game itself see's Lara tackle 4 areas that are broken up into 3 to 4 levels each, these are Peru, Greece, Egypt and finally Atlantis. The level design for the time is incredible and really second to none, its the classic Tomb Raider design of platforming, key/switch finding and occasional animal or boss battles but for the time is was fresh and exciting. My Only gripe with the levels is that each areas levels can feel repetitive from a graphical point of view, even though the layout of these levels are vastly different they use allot of the same styles and textures.From a graphics and sound stand point, for a 1996 game it looks and sounds great. 3D environments bring the world together and Lara’s character model looks good if not a little.....pointy. Only issues are a poor draw distance which can be quite jarring in 2016 and sounds sometimes don’t play when they are supposed too however this is an issue in both PC and console versions of the game. The levels don’t have a soundtrack as such, but more occasional sound bites as you adventure, or sounds play to symbolise and secret being discovered or door opening. Sounds of Lara's movements, gun fire and other NPC's are all good for 1996. Some character models of other humans could be improved however as the difference between them and Lara in quality is quite obvious.The game play is what we have all come to know, love and find frustrating. It’s the usual fair of run, jump, roll, dodge and shoot. There is allot more emphasis on platforming in Tomb Raider as opposed to the other games in the series and only a few enemies appear in levels. To be honest in 2016 Lara did not feel as ""tank"" like as I thought she might but it can be a challenge to move her around. More often than not I died because she did not jump when I wanted her too or due to the dated graphics a ledge was not as close as I thought. This was frustraiting in 1996 and is frustraiting in 2016 so be warned before you play. It did however not stop my overall enjoyment of the game and replaying it 20 years after it first came out was a complete joy. The PC version also bennifits from its ability to save wherever you like mid level, PlayStation and Saturn versions of the game had to make use of save cristals scattared thoughout the levels and this became more than a slight annoyance on the consoles.Over all Tomb Raider is a fantastic game, it blew us away in 1996 and in 2016 it’s not as hard to play as I thought it would be. The story is solid and helps move things forward nicely and the overall presentation for the time of release is top notch. This is all complemented with fantastic level design if not slightly aesthetically repetitive. On a modern PC with windows 10 the games runs well, only issues I had is FMV's stretch to fit the screen which can make them harder to watch and there is also a slight delay between them starting and playing on screen only a second or two but this really does not detract too much.Overall Tomb Raider is an all time great that will go down as a classic. - 9.2/10 - PC     9.0/10 - PS1/Saturn"

Tesselated breasts don't make up for the lack of challenge, particularly in the game's puzzles (though they are appreciated! :D )I still proudly keep the save games from my second run through all those years back where I managed to complete the game with only one save per level!If you've never played this original classic, then you simply must!

I recommend the game for it's originality and storyline, not what it looks like. DosBox isn't bad at all and was the standard back then (1996) when certain games were being re-coded for compatibility reasons. So......It's nice to see a 19 year old game still capable of playing on a XP or Vista system.

,Recommended,224960,21625465,"Posted: 4 March, 2016",all,Zer0,"Tomb Raider is an action platformer made and released by Core Design in the year 1996. This game was originally released for the Playstation 1, and Sega Saturn. It was also released for PC through the usage of DOSBox. For those who are wanting to get into the Lara Croft : Tomb Raider series, this game is somewhat hard to recommend, despite being the first of the franchise.Please not that I have played and beaten both, the PS1 and PC edition. This review, however, is based upon my experience with the Steam version of Lara Croft : Tomb Raider 1StoryThe story is decent. The cutscenes just tell you enough to get you started, then leaves the rest to your imagination. It reveals itself the further  it goes in, followed by a lame plot twist at the end which left me dumb founded. Overall, its not bad.7.5GraphicsFor an old school game, it looks alright. The game was made back when polygonal 3D graphics started going big, so there was much work to be done before they could perfect making any round objects. Back in it's time, it was no doubt some of the top of the line graphics. Compared to today's technology in graphical development, it's hard to get into this type of game unless you're a fan of the classics. If you are are into the ""shiny"" and new games, then look away, this game is not for you.7.0SoundI'm usually very picky when it comes to in- game music, sound effects, etc... but TR had nothing I could really complain about. The music and effects seemed pretty immersive, which left little to be desired in this specific type of game. The battle music is intense and frightening, giving the game more of the survival feel in intense situations. Also, the music for the theme, finding secrets, and walking into a mysterious place has always suited the moment well. As for the effects, they are alright for an old school DOS game. Every creature, environment, and protagonist has the appropriate sounds for the given situations, which yet again increases immersion. The only aspect I disliked was that of the main protagonist, Lara. Every time she climbs a ledge, runs into a wall, jumps... it sounds far  too artificial... like she's having an... errr.... nevermind. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)7.5GameplayThe gameplay is my favorite part about this game. The puzzles are somewhat challenging, and the parkour is fun and feels dangerous. The gun fights feel stiff due to the controls, but is still enjoyable. And the thing that makes this so great is the dangerous traps that lurk in each tomb. Avoiding and trying to expect what trap is next is what TR is all about. Feeling that you know something is wrong down the hallway, there probably is. There could be a boulder coming from both directions, or some poison darts coming from the walls, or maybe even a dinosaur will break through the ceiling? That's what makes these kind of games so fun. You don't really know what to expect (At least on your first playthrough). Most of the traps are somewhat unpredictable, so this definitely deserves some big pointers.8.5ControlsThe controls are a tad bit funky. Why? Because I said so (Kidding).For reals, the controls aren't as bad as what people think. The controls are very stiff, so manueverability is somewhat an issue.  I personally used my number pad to link my actions to, then used my wasd as movement. It too some getting used to, but in the end you'll manage.However....If you are more of a console enthusiast, or just cant stand using the keyboard for this game... then check out this controller support guide by Darth Sidious ~http://store.steampowered.comSince this is an old school game I'll give it some slack on the controls.7.0CinematicsThe cimematics for Tomb Raider were great in terms of quality. That is, I wish I could say that for the PC version. Compared to the Playstation version, the cutscenes are astrocious. Even with all the DosBox tweaking guides I dug up, nothing would seem to fix it. However, this game is not plagued with too many cinematics, so this can be forgiven easily.4.5ReplayabilityThis game has very little replayability to it. After my first playthrough, I never really felt the need to collect all the secrets collectibles since they never did anything special. For those of you who played it before purchasing the game on steam would most likely replay it due to nostalgic reasons. But besides that, I wouldn't really see much of a point.4.5==============================================================================Overall Score7.0A good game for you classic gamers who enjoy platformers and puzzles.

Apparently since this is an older game it uses something called DOSBox and if you want to configure a controller you will be fighting a losing battle. If you are okay with playing with the keyboard then  this game is for you. With controllers you may get about half of it configured and then it won't save your configuration. There might be a way to fix it but I haven't really found anything except that others are experiencing the same problem. The game will randomly freeze sometimes and will freeze if you try mapping the controller by hitting F1. The game is a great game and I am disappointed that I can't enjoy it. I mean I didn't expect a game that I paid for to be freezing up especially with settings being normal and full internet connection. It would be really nice for an update by either Dosbox or Steam to fix the problem.  So I'm really nuetral about the game, because if you don't mess with the controller and work off the keyboard then it tends to run okay, but if you try to configure the controller then its downhill from there."

Also, no controller support, unless you plan on playing the whole game using just one joystick, because no other controller functions work.After all this, you'll be thinking, ""Man, I really like this game, but I think it's time for me to turn it off."" Well buckle up, buddy boy, because when you hit that Exit Game button, Windows will stop working entirely. Control, Alt, Delete won't save you, that sucker is frozen.

The platforming is not as difficult as it seems after you learn how to move Lara. Shooting, on the other hand, is truly terrible for the whole gameI think the graphics are fine. If you follow the guides on the forums, you can play this in a decent resolution, and the block-made characters bring some nostalgia - it's like playing Doom/Shadow Warrior/Duke Nukem, the old graphics are charmingSo why am I giving this a negative review? Because of the level design. Don't get me wrong, I wonder when was the last time I played a game with stages this big and full of secrets. But character movement is slow, there's an insane amount of annoying platforming that requires pinpoint precision, and some levels have this bad design where you can mess up and have to backtrack to undo somethingPlease don't take this negative review as a ""avoid this game completely"".

After frustration of trying to figure out simple maneuvers, I found the menu that shows controls, only to have camera angle (defined in game as ""look"") just say PADO. It has to run through emulation software called dos box which may or may not crash on you occasionally. It's hard to believe Soul Reaver and Mario 64 came out around the same time as this.What I did happen to think was pretty neat was that in the Steam menu you can access the original manual, which starts with an introduction to Laura's beginnings.

That wouldn't be fair. No, this game is bad even for the time it came out.The biggest problem for me are the controls. First, as far as I can tell, there is no native support for gamepads or even the mouse. The former is somewhat understandable (even relatively recent games often lack this, even when they're console ports), but the latter is totally inexcusable for a game made in 1996. There are ways to map the keys to a modern controller, but that's of limited use because the controls are AWFUL.Basic movement is okay; the game uses tank controls, which work okay... unless you have to move quickly, in which case you're pretty screwed. Jumping is finicky, and the positions you have to be in for certain jumps (or to pick up items or flip switches) are super precise. Lara runs by default, and you'll almost always have to stop, turn in place, and walk slowly to get to the exact spatial point the game wants you to be in to pick something up or flip a switch.There is also NO camera control. Oh, you can look around while you're standing still; but you can't move the camera while Lara is in motion, and it springs right back to the default fixed camera angle as soon as you let go on the look button. This often means making jumps onto ledges or whatnot that you can't actually see.A game with controls like this should also not have an emphasis on combat, or if it does the enemies should be slow. Instead, there's tons of combat and EVERY SINGLE ENEMY IN THE GAME is faster than you, and will often stun-lock you to death. Thankfully, you don't really have to aim - Lara will do that herself - but sometimes the autoaim just plain doesn't work, or it won't point at the enemy you want.There are also a number of timed precision platforming puzzles in the game that are nearly impossible with the game's terrible control scheme. In fact, one of them in one of the last levels I literally couldn't get through except by glitching the game physics out and forcing Lara through a hole she wasn't supposed to be able to get through.There are also a few bugs I encountered, though I'm not sure if these are the game's fault or DOSBox's. Certain areas will be dark the first time you come through, but then if you reload the save it will be well-lit (or vice versa). There's also several points in the second to last level where Lara will sometimes just burst into flame for no reason (apparently a problem with the hitbox detection on the lava). Unfortunately, Core Design's been dead for seven years, so I don't know who to send a bug report to.I honestly don't know how anybody beat this game on a console or in the original PC version, which only had save points. The only way I was able to complete it with my sanity intact was to save every couple minutes - more or less every time I completed a difficult jump or killed a few enemies. Even so, the game is infuriating. It took me 21 hours to complete; without the ability to save anywhere, it probably would have been double or triple that. (Or more likely, I just would've given up.)"

The directonial keys only take Lara's angle into account, rather than the current viewing angle like most modern games. Should Lara be facing the camera, then pressing the 'Forward button' will move her towards the camera, rather than turning around and actually walking 'forward' from the camera's perspective.Bought this game when it was 75% off.

It's mostly becasue of how poorly it's put together. When you look at a cinematic cutscene, it's poorly colored and heavily pixelated. I understand it's most likely a port from console, but it seems like no one put forth any effort to clean it up for a PC monitor. Further problems I've noticed are the selected control bindings. I was so happy that I would finally be playing a childhood favorite of mine, and I expected that I would get to customize my key bindings; this was not the case obviously. I did, however, have two choices for binding sets. Neither of them are very intuitive. It was actually quite painful to try and learn them.I tried fiddling with the resolution becasue it was bugging me a bit and it crashed the game. I tried multiple times at different menus and parts of the game, but I was unsuccessful. It might be better for someone who is more skilled with their fingers and is savvy with changing gameplay visuals than I.Gameplay graphics are a bit buggy, but so were the originals so... _                _\_(o.o)_/Audio is also a bit weird too, sort of like they recorded it from a TV.Hope this helped (More importantly I hope the people who ported this sees this and takes action)"

I saw this game on steam for sale for $1.74 and was like, you know what, I've never played any Tomb Raider game before, let’s try this out. I downloaded the game and then launched it. The cut scenes in the game are horrible, I think they used a video compressor to compress the videos so that they wouldn't take up a lot of space or something. I played the first part of the first mission, it took me 25 minutes to beat it because I needed to learn the controls and how they worked and I needed to learn how the game worked. Like the cut scenes, the combat is also horrible in this game (mostly because the controls are bad.) Thank god it auto-aims for you. I also don't like the camera angles, most of the time the camera angle is fine but sometimes it goes into a weird and awkward position. I also didn’t like that you can't run left or right, like you must turn to the direction you wanted and then you pressed forward to go that way. Honestly, the game has a very good concept to it, you run in a tomb and explore it with not knowing what lies ahead, I like that, but since the controls are wonky and some mechanics are weird, I can't recommend the game to someone who is new to the Tomb Raider series. I will try to play the game more and try to learn the controls better. The only people I can recommend this game to is classic gamer, fans of the tomb raider series or PS1 game fans. In conclusion, the game has a very good concept of exploring caves, but the controls ruin the combat, jumping, and movement."

At Natla's request, Lara sets out on an expedition to recover a mysterious artifact in the mountains of Peru. Thus begins TOMB RAIDER the greatest adventure game of all time!Developed by Core Design it was originally released in1996 for MS-DOS, Sony Playsation, and the SEGA Saturn.Toby Gard (Galleon) is credited with the creation of Lara Croft.The character went through several changes before Core settled on the version she became famous for. In its earliest conception, Lara Croft was a male placeholder for an as yet undefined character, but as Core decided that puzzles and stealth should be more important to the game than action, they found that these requirements better suited a female character than a classic male action hero.During some interviews, Toby Gard famously claimed that he changed the character from male to female because he decided that if he had to stare at the character's backside for hours on end while designing and playtesting the game, it might as well be an attractive female backside - although this is assumed to be a joke on the part of Gard, poking fun at the attention Lara was receiving for her sex appeal and had little if any actual sway into the final decision to make Lara a woman.The game is presented in a third person perspective where Lara is always visible with the camera following the action from behind or over her shoulder. The world Lara inhabits is characterised by its cubic nature. The object of Tomb Raider is to guide Lara through a series of tombs and other locations in search of treasures and artefacts. On the way, she must kill dangerous animals and other creatures, while collecting objects and solving puzzles. Unlike the 2013 reboot, the emphasis lies on solving puzzles and performing trick jumps to complete each level rather than gunplay.The music for Tomb Raider was composed by Nathan McCree. Unlike most other games of the time, there was not a musical track playing constantly throughout the game; instead, limited musical cues would play only during specially-selected moments in order to produce a dramatic effect, such as enhancing tension during an action sequence or accompanying the discovery of a hidden secret. For the majority of the game, the only audio heard is action-based effects (e.g. footsteps or explosions), atmospheric sounds (like the roar of a nearby waterfall), and Lara's own grunts and sighs, all of which were enhanced because they did not have to compete with music.The game was critically and commercially successful, selling millions of copies worldwide and earning a 91 aggregate score according to Metacritic and is considered widely influential, serving as a template for the many 3D action-adventure games that would follow.I give this game 10/10"

Still, Steam has rendered a tremendous service to Tomb Raider fans by making the game playable on modern PCs via their platform. True, there is the PSN version, but it really looks terrible on high definition tvs. If Steam really wants to make my day, they will also release the original Tomb Raider's gold levels for their platform.

Once a cutting edge invitation to a brand new era of 3D video games, today it offers a trip back in time to the rather primitive beginnings of modern gaming. But that sure doesn't make it any less fascinating.The controls, of course, stand out right away for their inaccessibility compared to modern standards. The famous ""tank"" movement scheme, though, is easier to acclimate to than you might expect. Thanks to the game being in full 3D with a proper behind-the-back camera, you'll be moving forward most of the time anyway, using left and right to subtly ""steer"" Lara as you go. It isn't perfect (and in combat situations much less so), but it's never the mess that similar controls can create in 2D environments, like in the early Resident Evils.More surprising is how finicky the jumping mechanics are. When standing still, the jump button must be pushed justbeforethe direction to jump in, while running jumps over gaps have a specific logic to their timing that makes Lara jump automatically the moment she reaches a platform's edge. Points like these mean it's important to get acquainted with the game's eccentricities before you begin, but doing so is quick and easy thanks to a concise and effective tutorial that's selectable at any time from the main menu.So once you've done that, and gotten into the mindset of a late '90s gamer, what lies before you? Why, one of the major milestones of video game history, of course. Considered in context, it's easy to see why Tomb Raider was such a big deal for its time. Releasing in the same six-month window as the original Quake and Super Mario 64, it gave its players an early taste of the sort of freedom of exploration that we take for granted today. And explore you will, as you make your way from room to room, throwing switches, finding keys, and stumbling across cleverly hidden item pickups, with little to guide you but your own skills of observation. At its core, this is a puzzle game about navigating 3D spaces, figuring out where you need to go next, and how to get there. These design principles are some that still form the basics of many modern games, so its only natural that they remain entertaining all these years later.There's no denying that Tomb Raider is showing its age, and from start to finish you're not likely to forget that it was originally built for the Sega Saturn. But if you're willing to learn to play by its rules, you'll find that Lara Croft's debut outing is still a satisfying adventure, and her quest to uncover an ancient treasure has become something of an ancient treasure all its own."

It's all all-time classic, considered a milestone in graphics and inventive gameplay, and helped shape the beloved tradition of starring eye-pleasing females in video games.Is it worth revisiting? Yes and no. The levels are incredibly repetitive; cave walls and temples are all you will see. You will spend hours dragging blocks and running back and forth between switches, ever finding little if any resistance from enemies. Also, are 4 different weapons really enough in our homicidal gaming world? You don't even get the uzis until the 12th level! The challenge lies in the unforgivable controls, where delayed jumping mechanics and treacherous distances make a two-headed monster you will come to respect, love and hate.I feel that rating this game above the sequel, Tomb Raider 2, would be based on sentiment rather than content, but that remains one guy's opinion. Even if it is a good one. In conclusion: the game is definitely worth replaying for those of us who had the chance to experience the golden era of PS1, but I would not recommend this game to a new player, even if they are into the franchise.Groke out!"

,Recommended,224960,7987597,"Posted: 9 December, 2013",all,DAMIENX88,"Few years ago when I watched the trailer for Tomb Raider reboot I was so amazed that decided to play it right away. But search results on Steam returned many more and so I decided to play those first. Winter sale was just around the corner so I waited a little bit and bought all of them. This is because I'm kind of man who likes to have a good look at the origin story because thinks that almost 20 years from game's release there may be something I could miss if I skipped all the previous ones.Obviously when we're talking about a game that is this old we're not looking for pretty graphics but rather an atmosphere, story and even feelings that it may bring. Talking about graphics characters are blocky and Lara's breasts could poke your eye out but that's fine by me. What I remember from the game after 2 years since playing it? I remember when I sat in a dark room for better immersion and rushing to the couch to make myself comfortable before any intros begin. It started with a nuclear blast somewhere in a desert and a conversation in some hotel in New Mexico. I was listening very carefully to consume all those story details that I wanted so badly. And that scene wasn't the most exciting thing in the game. But when I stepped into the caves I was hooked that very moment. It felt a bit scary even. It seemed like it was snowing inside my room and I could feel the cold. Thankfully I was able to put myself together and start playing.And so the game began. I had those famous double pistols I saw in Lara Croft movies. I tried moving around, shooting, figured out controls. But little did I know what was waiting for me in those caves. I liked a lot how the game was actually teaching me to paly. Even though I skipped the training course in the mansion (which I regret by the way). I was so immersed that my first encounter with the wolver scared the hell out of me. And probably it wasn't the wolf but the music that played when it appeared in from of me. But it wasn’t just the music that was adding to the atmosphere the sound effects in general. Howling winds, Lara's jogging, shooting sounds it was all great. But let's get to the gameplay, shall we? At firs it is no problem to progress. But farther I went the harder some puzzles became. I will try as spoiler-free as possible so I'll just focus on how it felt for me rather that what it was. And I think those puzzles actually shaped the game quite a bit. It felt so satisfying to solve some of them and they were quite logical and some of them even required knowledge of Greek mythology. Quite nice if you ask me. And sometimes there were hidden puzzles which would reward you with ammo and/or guns. And you need to be very attentive when you're looking for them. But it was totally worth it because even though you can complete the game with just your pistols having those cool guns makes the game much more interesting and shooting your foes more satisfying and badass. And you'll probably need those guns when you encounter the first boss in the caves.Bosses to Tomb Raider are awesome. They are not too easy or too hard to beat. All you need to do is some tinkering to find their weak spot or pattern of their attack and movement. So I would describe them as 'fun'. And this what games supposed to be - fun. And I had a lot of fun in general. They are not repetitive and diverse and that's what made me waiting to get to one. And what's great is that you don't always know when you find one. But be prepared anyway. And there's one thing that is keeping you from them are the levels and it's not something to sneeze at because you can get lost in some of them, some levels took me quite a white to find a way out of. Luckily you can save in any place at any time. And I found myself overusing it and sometimes I was saving a lot while being afraid of loosing my progress and instead I was loosing sense of immersion. Checkpoints is something I would totally appreciate but I don't think the concept was even there in 1996. There's wasn't quick save either. There was a button but you still had to select a save slot. Other than that I don't really have any complaints.Final level was very creepy and I wished I could complete it fast but it wasn't to be because it was quite large too. But I soldiered on and reached the final boss. And boy was it epic. I had big guns and was able to kick♥♥♥♥♥ If I said anything else I would spoil it all for you. Also remember to use your guns on your way to the boss because I found myself having to many unused ammo in some cases and sacrificed some fun while going through the levels before the boss.So there you have it. I totally recommend playing it especially now when you have it not only on PC but on mobile phones and tablets too. But beware that I recommend it to people who care about solid gameplay more than about graphics.More reviews from Gameaways Curator"

The game is weak on graphics sure but once you put it to 1080p resolution it's fine.  The puzzles and the frustration before an enormous satisfaction when finally completed is worth the trouble to put the time into the very fun but dated game. It's very surprising how long this game takes to beat, something like a little over an hour per level for myself (18.2hrs for 15 levels).  I played with a Xbox 360 controller (You can find a really simple way to set it up online with a downloaded file and a text file edit).  The only visual kind of alteration I did was tweak some text files again to change resolution and cutscenes to play at 1920x1080.  Expect to save many, many,many times, by the end of the game you will become a master at quicksaving at almost every important jump or discovery as you will find out the controls can be a bit frustrating to deal with at times.  Honestly I would say stick it out and complete it if you enjoy it, I played a little bit at a time, often quiting halfway through a level, but you will make it eventually and won't regret it.  Had a few times where I thought the game was broken and there was no way of progressing, and everytime I checked on a guide online I smacked my forehead as I discovered sometimes the smallest, and sometimes the most obvious thing ever.  In short go play it, even if it's only an hour or a level at a time, the graphics can be ignored and the controls can be adapted to."

I played my first Tomb Raider, which was Legend, when I was 15. However, I developed such a love for the series that I went back and purchased all of the original titles on the Playstation as well (actually, I have Chronicles on Dreamcast, but that's neither here nor there), and I must say that they are excellent even today. Thankfully, the PC version of TR1 allows you to save anywhere, unlike the PS1 version which utilizes save crystals. UGH, what a nightmare those were. They returned for the PS1 version of TR3 as well, which made playing it completely impossible for people like me. I have Windows 10, and the game runs perfectly on my computer, although I should mention that the emulation software DOSbox is what makes the game play. The FMV cutscenes look awful in this port, there's flickering all over, and it changes screen resolution every time it opens a new cutscene, causing my computer to pull up an ugly red box every time saying ""This resolution is not optimal, blah blah blah."" Thankfully I was able to find a way around this. The game runs smoothly, and looks miles better than the PS1 version on it's own, although it could look better. I got this game with every other TR game in the TR Collection, currently on sale for only $16!

My issue with the game is more technical though.First: This is a PSX to DOS port. The game literally starts it's own DOS prompt (using DOSbox) and launches. It does not run natively within windows. It's not a deal breaker, just annoying. In order to get the game into full screen or change any settings concerning graphics, input mapping, ect.... you have to alt+tab out of the game and get into DOSbox, change the settings you like, and then continue.Second: DOSbox does not correctly recognize joysticks or controllers. I've been using my PS3 Sixaxis controller for playing many games. Almost all PC games I've played work just fine with the controller. Not so much with this game. In fact, only 4 buttons on my controller work.Lastly: (And this is very important) There is no clear way that I have found to change the keyboard mapping. ""WASD"" can be set to move your character around, but you have to use buttons for the camera too! There is no mouse support for this game. (It runs in DOS) Which leaves you fumbling around just to make simple jumps. I never made it as far as any combat, though I'm sure that would have been a real pain in the rear.To conclude: Skip this one. I got it as part of a bundle, so I don't feel too bad for grabbing it. But seriously, skip it. Find it elsewhere. Find a better port. Pull out that old grey PlayStation sitting in your closet and scrounge EBay for an origional disc.

As with many 3D games of its time, the graphics look awful by today's standards. Thankfully there are mods to at least be able to run it at a higher resolution, but it's not going to make Lara Croft look any less blocky. The early Tomb Raider games developed by Core all have weird controls that will probably take some getting used to, but once you do, they're not too bad. Despite these flaws, it's still fun to solve puzzles and pump wild animals full of lead, which is why I still enjoy coming back to this game now and then. I've played through the first two levels so many times that I could probably write a book on them.If you're a long-time Tomb Raider fan, you don't need me to tell you to buy this. If you're a newer fan coming from the Crystal Dynamics games (such as the 2013 reboot), I'd say the original is at least worth trying to see how far the series has come in the last 20 years."

This is basicly what the whole game is about:At a hotel in present day Calcutta, Lara Croft is approached by an American named Larson Conway, who works for the wealthy businesswoman Jacqueline Natla, owner of Natla Technologies. At Natla's request, Lara sets out on an expedition to recover a mysterious artefact called the Scion from the lost tomb of Qualopec, in the mountains of Peru. After successfully retrieving the object, she is attacked by Larson who attempts to claim it. She beats him then questions him, learning that the artefact she has is only a fragment and that a man named Pierre Dupont has been hired by Natla to collect the rest.Lara breaks into Natla Technologies to find out Pierre's whereabouts. She discovers a medieval monk's journal, which reveals the depths of an ancient monastery of St. Francis in Greece to house the tomb of Tihocan, a ruler of Atlantis, along with a second piece of the Scion. Traveling to the monastery, Lara descends through an expansive underground complex, pursued and attacked throughout by Pierre Dupont. At the tomb of Tihocan, Lara recovers the second piece of the Scion and finally kills Pierre. An inscription inside the tomb states that Tihocan was ""one of the two just rulers"" of Atlantis.When Lara joins the two pieces of the Scion, she receives a vision of the three Atlantean rulers and their respective pieces of the Scion. One of them utilises it to create a mutant breed, but the other two confront her, and take her piece of the Scion. Then Atlantis is struck by a fireball from the skies, and the three pieces of the Scion become scattered as the civilisation is destroyed. One of them goes to Egypt, Lara's next destination.Lara travels to the City of Khamoon, a temple complex in Egypt that houses the final fragment. Here she battles the fierce mutants seen in her vision, and is once again confronted by Larson, this time in a battle to the death. She then takes the final piece of the Scion from the underground sanctuary. Upon leaving the tomb, she is ambushed by Natla and her henchmen, who steal the three artefacts and nearly kill her.Having escaped, Lara stows away on their boat, which takes her to a remote island where mining operations of Natla Technologies have partially exposed the Great Pyramid of Atlantis. After making her way through the mines dispatching Natla's goons and the mutant-infested interior of Atlantis, Lara reaches the heart of the pyramid chamber, where the complete Scion has been fused together as a source of power. Touching it, Lara receives another vision, where Natla is revealed as the previously seen third ruler of Atlantis. She betrays her co-rulers by abusing the power of the Scion for genetic experimentation, and as punishment is locked in a stasis cell by Qualopec and Tihocan, her resting place until the prologue of the game.Natla enters the chamber and confronts Lara; having reclaimed the artifacts, she attempts to restore her former power with an army of mutants. Lara attempts to shoot the scion, Natla tackles her through the observation window. Natla falls into a crevasse, but Lara manages to land on the breeding platform, confronting Natla's largest mutant abomination. After defeating the monstrosity, she destroys the scion and attempts to escape the collapsing pyramid. As she makes her way out she meets Natla a final time, now mutated and winged. After beating her, Lara flees the island just as the place is destroyed."

For that, Tomb Raider is a different kind of game than most others that has it's niche. The best points for a recommendation are the games enjoyable atmosphere and lack of direction. The environments are open with no true goal, which for many can kill the experience, however traveling around dangerous and precarious tombs in the search for the unknown can be very satifying to many. The controls are cumbersome and might cause for the game to be needless precise, but it could be rewarding once you really get a grasp on your environments and positioning.The story sort of difficult to comprehend, not to mention awkwardly presented. Some of the characters are enjoyable (Particularly Lara) but they're mostly cartoonish in goofy ways. Combat is very basic and monotonous, I'd argue it's the least involving part of the game. This is not a direct port of the PS1 version, so you may want to look into mods if you want more music cues and the expansion pack that was released. If you're into quieter, slow-paced games, I'd recommend this, but if clunky-controls, dated graphics, (expected for the time) no direction, and subpar combat all sound like too many bad things to justify the time put in, then stay away."

There's a guide on Steam that shows how to do both.ControlsControls are, quite frankly, atrocious. I've been playing the Tomb Raider series for over 15 years, and I still find them frustrating! Later games in the series have improved the controls a bit, but not much. Playing on PC with a keyboard might be easier/more accurate than on the PS1.GraphicsThey are quite dated. There's a mod that imports the HD textures from the iOS/Android port, and it improves it immensely. (There's a guide that shows how to do it on Steam.)Even with the graphics improvements, there is still screen tearing and glitches like seeing other parts of the level while against a wall and some textures popping in and out. Those don't really detract too much from the gameplay. Keep in mind that the game was released in 1996, so graphics tech wasn't great at the time (Razor sharp boobies).FMV cutscenes on PC are garbage. They are interlaced, compressed, and low-res. There's a mod that can download high-res FMV files that are remastered.Gameplay3D platforming at it's CORE (haha get it?) with some gunplay, but not as much as the others in the series (especially 2 and 3). Sometimes the crate pushing/pulling feels like Sokoban.Sometimes the gameplay gets a little repetitive, I mean, how many permutations of swinging blades and spike pits are there? The enemies add some variation and challenge to the platforming aspect and helps to keep it fresh, especially theraptors and T-Rex in Lost Valley.Level designGood God! The levels can be long and tedious (thank goodness for unlimited saves on PC). Some levels/areas are difficult to get through without a guide/walkthrough.Even though the levels can be quite large and take some time to get through, I still found the levels enjoyable, well designed, and satisfying to complete.ConclusionAll in all, I rate Tomb Raider 8/10. I highly recommend getting this piece of gaming history, even if its just for nostalgia or to play for the first time.Especially nab this game on sale (as of writing 7/4/17: it's $1.39)."
,Recommended,224960,33349093,Posted: 7 July,all,Fluttershy,"I've been playing these games my entire life, but this is the first time I've played the original... And I got to say, the original is the least functional, but it gets the job done for what it is. I'm not dissing the game in any way though. It's actually one of my favorite games in the series. So let's get onto the pros and cons of the game.Pros:-Lara Croft. Let's move on because everyone in the world knows what I'm going to say about her... She's a soulless murderer who seems to be able to survive ridiculous falls in cutscenes, but if she drops an inch off the ground in-game, she's dead.-Puzzles. Actual puzzles. None of that, ""We'll give you the answer and you decypher it,"" crap, nope! This game has you running around until you figure out the answer or give up. And most of the puzzles actually pertain to optional stuff required for 100% completion, and aren't required to complete the story.-Infinite ammo pistols. Let's be honest, any game with infinite ammo anything is more fun and MUCH easier since well, you're able to fire wildly into a wall with an endless magazine of ammo and never run out.-Glitchy pistol firing. Like classic Resident Evil games (specifically Resident Evil 2), you can quick fire in this game if you mash the buttons the right way. It's not easy, and most of the time it won't work, but when you do get the right rhythm for it, you can fire up to 2.5 times faster than normal (in my experience).Cons:-Really, REALLY, REALLY! Bad controls... Controversial opinion but I DESPISE the controls of older Tomb Raider games. The controls in this game in particular though are sticky. Yes, it was probably easier to code, but it was also harder to play with. And yes, at times, the controls are really good and helpful, but most of the time, the controls are garbage...-""Retro"" graphics. Look, before I continue, let me say that I like old style graphics. But I'm not naive, I know other people don't always like that look for games. In this case, the graphics are bad, even for my standards. Lara Croft, the mesh you'll see running the entire game is really low poly, objects show through walls, walls show through other walls, and even Lara Croft can be lost through a wall. The collisions of course are normal, but rendering priorities are a bit, odd...Neutral:-The game runs in DosBox. If anyone doesn't know what that is, it is an emulator for Dos. So basically, you could get a PSX emulator and actually have an easier time playing this (given you have the game), and have a less chance of having to reset the game when changing graphics settings, or you could get the PC version to edit it. It's not exactly open source, but it's definitely not closed source like games of nowadays... Then again, no one using Dos really wanted to put in the effort to develop mods for it since well, everything was done through text.All in all, the game isn't bad. But if you're new to Tomb Raider, I'd recommend getting Tomb Raider Anniversary instead. It has much better controls, graphics, and framerate..."

It was the first 3D game that I'd ever played, and it's still one of my favorites to this day! The tone of the game keeps you tense while feeling both ominous and splendid when encountering new areas. Like others have said, few games capture the charm and solitary immersion that this game achieves! Made before a time when playing online with others and achievments were a thing, you can really lose yourself in this adventure with nothing in the game to interrupt, instruct, remind, or otherwise nag you. I really wish more games were like this nowadays. :(The biggest downsides to owning this game on steam are the lack of xinput support for this game and the fact that there is none of the iconic music in the game! However, at least the music part can be extracted from the pc version and put into your Steamapps Tomb Raider files, which works flawlessly after that. I haven't figured out if there's a way to enable Xbox/Steam controller support (joytokey?) but I find this game casual enough to use a keyboard with it just fine, especially since you can set your own keys and save in-game unlimitedly."

The controls are very hard to get used to. Even at the end, you'll still do something wrong every now and then. The camera frequently is in a bad angle too. The gameplay can sometimes be harder than the puzzle to solve.The game was much better in my memories. Yet, I enjoyed revisiting it after all these years despite some frustration.As for if I recommend the game, Steam only offer Yes/No while my answer would probably be : ""maybe"".1- I cannot recommend such a game for someone who's simply looking fo a new game to play. The game aged too badly. There are better and more enjoyable games out there at the same price or even lower. By today's standard, it's a very bad game.2- However, if you want to re/visit the game out of nostalgia or just out of curiosity to see the game that started the serie and which was a pearl at its time, then go for it.Since I can only choose Yes or No, I choosed ""Yes"" because I belong to the second category. The game also run pretty well. No issues to report except that alt+tab causes the game to crash. Yet, I would probably wait for it to be in sale."

It has the perfect balance of difficulty while keeping you interested in continuing. I finished this on my console (hence the 7 minutes played on PC) and you'll be surprised how well this competes with modern games in terms of raw game design.Yes, the tank controls take awhile to get used to - but once you do,  you may actually find yourself liking it. It gives a good focus on platforming over action. Action isn't what Tomb Raider is supposed to be. Instead, you'll be challenged with all sorts of clever puzzles and tricky platforming with the action parts being a side dish.As a fan of the original franchise, I really despised the modern Tomb Raider games. I'm sticking with my guns when I say that these oldie originals beat the new ones right out of the water.If you give this game a fair piece of mind, it'll deliver for sure."
,Recommended,224960,29976577,Posted: 16 February,all,P to the OpTiXs,"Ok, as you can notice I've only played 3.2 hours. This is half true, since I spent 2 or more hours getting the damn thing to work as well as my controller but honestly it was because of my dual monitor setup so I had to go into the config files (dosbox conf) and change the res to 1024x768 This is because the max res is 4:3 so no 1680x1050 for me D:. Anyways at first I thought this game was garbage after. I tried using joytokey but since it didn't work for me I had to copy and paste someones xbox controller settings. The game at first seemed to control like a slippery wet beach ball until I learned that walking and adjusting yourself with the strafe are KEY ELEMENTS to this game. When I learned how to actually control the thing I finally realized that the controls are another part of the difficulty. If it were easier, then the game would be so much easier. No sarcasm, the controls remind me of dark souls where buttons must be pressed very fast and in order in order to do things like jump attack and jump in general. Speaking of jumping you're going to be doing a lot of it and it is almost always better to jump then move than the opposite because lara jumps when her foot hits the ground. This again adds more difficulty. All in all I think I'm going to enjoy the rest of lara, it seems to be filled with good puzzles and enemies."

There was no fixed path to follow, instead there were different ways you could approach a problem, secrets to seek out and dynamic puzzles to solve like no one had seen in a video game before, and all this in complete third person 3D. For what Tomb Raider lost in graphic fidelity and some control issues it more than made up for in it gave to the history of gaming. Not to mention the fact that Tomb Raider was revolutionary for having a strong female character in an Indiana Jonesesc role. For all its perceived bad points and the fact it has aged about as well milk on a hot day, Tomb Raider remains a classic that can be cited as the beginning of the third person action adventure genre as it exists today and I don’t care what anyone says it is magnitudes better than it’s 2007 remake.Full review below if you want to check it out:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtjtzK4ZJ1Y"

76561198033719770,Recommended,224960,30003659,Posted: 18 February,all,Neo-Rio,"What is there left to say? The original Tomb Raider is a classic game.Just as 3D games were coming of age, and as other game developers were focused mainly on developing the FPS genre, Tomb Raider made a 3D statement about puzzles, platforms, imaginative maps, and ancient booby traps! There's even a story with cutscenes! Yes there is a bit of shooting involved (and some tense moments!), but the game is all about exploration, discovery, and plenty of parkour. Need I mention that Lara Croft broke barriers by being the best female game protagonist since Ms. Pacman?The graphics have of course dated (jn fact they're so blocky that they're almost on par with Minecraft!), and the controls are a bit clunky and take some getting used to.... but ignore all of that. Once in a while, the environment will open up to reveal an amazing temple or work of art, complete with suitable ambient sound and you'll be taken aback.The level design is spot on - which is one thing that the developers CORE were experts at. Indeed there's a lot of imagination that goes into the level design as well. As with any adventure game, you might get a little bit stuck trying to solve the puzzles, but they're none too hard that you end up in frustration. At certain moments you'll have an epiphany on how to solve your problem, or perhaps you'll spy a secret tunnel that leads to a secret area!Tomb Raider was a tour-de-force in level design and anyone who calls themself a gamer, or a game level designer, needs to play this.Just mind Lara Croft's booby traps."

I haven't played this game since it first came out in 1996 and it is still BRILLIANT!The levels are huge, the puzzles make you think, you really have to be observant to spot all the secrets and sometimes even just to progress through the levels. The graphics aren't half as bad as I expected them to be after all this time.More interestingly, I actually think this is still better in many ways than the remake Anniversary. Sure, Anniversary added some real dizzying heights, and greater variety in movement, as well as the graphics update, but somehow this still feels better. Perhaps it's still having to hold Ctrl so that Lara doesn't fall off ledges, and her restricted moves mean that you really have to time some of those jumps correctly.  Perhaps it's just some old time nostalgia for the first game. But I'm still finding it thoroughly enjoyable and also head scratching as I try to recall some of the solutions from over 20 years ago!Cons are, of course, that you start hankering after some of the movements introduced in later games. Oh, how much I miss being able to go around corners while hanging! Even starting to miss the grappling hook (although, definitely not the ropes in Revelation). Cut scenes are laughable in places, but then they always were!Haven't yet got to completing the game, and I'm sure the final boss won't look as pretty as Anniversary, but so far I'm falling in love with the series all over again!Definitely play this if you want to find out where it all began."
