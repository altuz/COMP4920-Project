That one last good title they made before releasing the godawful Chronicles and Angel of Darkness.Tomb Raider the Last Revelation takes place in one singular location rather than different parts of the world. While that might seem like a downside, the design team actually implemented it very well. The game gradually branches out and becomes heavily non-linear. With the player returning to prior maps to solve newly found puzzles. They also added a map editor, and since the 90s hundreds of maps have been published onlineAdd to that a great story that keeps your attention and genuinely challenging puzzles. Delight yourself to the Last Revelation, ultimately the last great Tomb Raider game."

TRIV (when compared to TRIII) has advanced lighting effects (volumetric FX, bump mapping), better texture filtration and a new UI. The game is slightly less linear, since at some points you can travel between the levels (almost like open world, eh?) back and forth, the game has 70 secrets (there's no reward for getting all of them, but you get good rewards for each one of them). This time the story focuses on Egypt, where Lara unwillingly sets god Set free. Will you help her to save the world?

,Recommended,224980,8973291,"Posted: 4 February, 2014",all,LucasSM20,"Tomb Raider 4: The Last Revelation was the best TR game in my opinion. Why? Because it was a Tomb Raider game since the first one that was actuall about exploring tombs and fighting monsters (With a little appearence of bad guys). That said, let's go to the topics:Graphics: Pretty good for a 1999 game, actually. Texture variation is not so present because ambient is also not. That's because you will be put in on closed spaces more than open ones. Pyramids, temples and hidden tombs will be more seen than anything else. But the presentation of these places are actually nice, it doesn't get repetitive and you always know when a place is new or not.Gameplay: Picking up the style from the other TR games, it remained the same with a few additions. Lara can now jump into ropes, walk in them and best of all: DRIVE VEHICLES! That was a nice little adition, tough i din't find the vehicles gameplay so pleasurable for me. At least at a long time ago. For me, now isn't that bad. It's pretty ok.Gunplay feels the same from other games and doging from enemies still feels impossible, tough, as in other games, exploring is the key too fill up with medkits and ammo. Not much problem here.Puzzles are back and were the main focus of the game. You will waste more time on puzzles than killing enemies. They are complex, but not hard to do.Remember when i said i couldn't remember if the secrets followed the same pattern as TR 5? Yeah, it follows. Global statistics for secrets, no statistics per stage. And this game is HUGE, it is a big flaw to make harder to find the secrets in this game. At least, you don't win anything by finding it all, besides new weapons/items on your gameplay. Exploration is the key, once again.Soundtrack: More or less. Most of the time you will only hear ambient sounds. But when music plays, it always match with what's happening and feels like an epic adventure. Voice acting is quite decent and Lara's voice is sweet.Story: Here was the big point of this game. The plot tried to explore a bit of Lara's past at the beggining and tried to connect to the actual story that was happening. It went pretty well and many things have been done. A lot of effort was put in the Seth and Horus backstory and as more as you explore, more content is revealed. The game goes roughly for a lot of time because of this. It all went you...Until the ending. The boss battle felt so empty for me and the ending itself was quite sad and a cliffhanger.TR 4 was the best game of the franchishe for me and it was pleasurable to play. The focus on the adventure more than action served this game well for me and it made an unique experience.If devs that are doing the new Tomb Raider were to see a game where they could see what they SHOULD do with the series style of play, it should be this one."

When they finally made it the focus, I was crazy for it.  It's so amazing to see the whole Tomb Raider series on Steam.This specific one maintains the ""measured 3D geometric acrobatic movements"" gameplay style of the old games along with the puzzles and exploration.  If you can handle plenty of arbitrary insta-death trial-and-error but you LOVE the sense of exploration and discovery then this may be one of  your favorite game series like it is one of mine.  Vehicle sections, different weapons, welcome changes in aesthetics add to the variety.  All the while the whole level design feels like every piece was used for something.  A very unique game in a very unique series.A note on the NEWER Tomb Raiders.... they feel slightly more like Gears of War to me.  If you play the OLDER Tomb Raiders, expect more of an adventure game experience that focuses on analysis, making the correct jump/switch flip, and discovering the unique parts of the map."

You get everything you'd expect from Tomb Raider game (unless you're looking for next-gen graphics).I loved some of the new mechanics and new puzzles.By the way puzzles are even more complex sometimes (at least for me) and I could not figure out how to solve some of them so I resorted to some walkthroughs. And what makes it even more time consuming is that the game lets you to 2-3 levels and you can go back. And sometimes you will need to go back because you didn't find some item. Which can be frustrating sometimes. And some puzzle elements are not as apparent as in previous games.Other than that I really enjoyed the game but I would have liked it more if there was more shooting in the game.So if you are a fan of Tomb Raider pick this one up and have a good time.

But after a while you kinda get the hang of it, especially if you change the controls a little bit (Just press P and enter the ""config controls"", press Enter to reset the action you want, then press the new key to that command). It won't be perfect, but will be good enough. Sure, there will be times when you'll want to pull your hair out of rage, but since those also happened when I played on the Playstation, then perhaps it's just my inability to be a good gamer after all these years. Oh, also, the graphics are not as good as in the platform. So why do I still recommend this game? Because is f*ing Tomb Raider and since I don't plan on buying a Playstation anytime soon, this is will do. Especially since I payed really cheap for them, don't pay full price, you'll feel cheated.

,Recommended,224980,26084233,"Posted: 17 October, 2016",all,xTzharkz,"Tomb Raider IV had the best story comparin to the previous I, II, III ones. It had improvements, more items added to the puzzles such as corner climbing, doors, boxes, smaller size moving objects, trapdoors, scope aiming and so on and on. It does sound good but in a way it ruined the gameplay for me a little. I had to run over and over  and over again the same places (maps were bigger than in previous games), which left me so lost on what am I supposed to do. I had to use the walkthrough so many times and after finding out that I did try doing that and it did not work out for me (little wrong aiming or standing did not trigger it) I just lost the mood to play it. Sometimes where were some small unnoticiable target you had to aim and shoot, that was pretty much blendining in with the surroundings or had no glue where I have to go do get more progress, which stole so much time and ruined the gameplay. So I played the game on and off for a month while other ones I played through within few days.Graphics did improve, I guess... but not so impressively.But yeah, the story was really really good, it was well built up. It kept me intrested in what was going to happen next. So they nailed that. Plus ended with a scene that left me with questions and it seems the next game is going to continue from it. At least I hope so.Cutscenes were great. There was no house, which was sad. Item menu, or just the menu got worse... In my opinion. The idea of putting everything together made it so time consuming looking for med kit and then save, load or what ever I was looking for. Had to spin through the whole circle to get to the item I was looking for. I prefered the previous one more with up and down options.Tomb Raider IV did not have steam overlay either, no screenshots option to share in Steam. *sadface*I mostly recommend it to old school gamers and to the newest Tomb Raiders fans(to experience where it all got started from).My total gameplay took 37 hours! Like I said had to run back and forward. Because I had no idea what I had to do. At least  8 hours went for just running around like a headless chicken. :DOtherwize game was good, worth the buy.xTzharkz [Eric]"

,Recommended,224980,33259942,Posted: 4 July,all,Revenge,"I have to say that TR4 is my favorite Tomb Raider game and one of my favorite games overall. I may have few hours on steam, but I've played many hours in my ps1 ages ago, and I've played it before on PC too. Actually, it was one of the first games I played in a PC back in 99.I don't know about the technical issues everyone is complaining about. I still have a ten year old computer with win XP and I run the game there, as I do with every other game with more than a decade. And the game runs flawlessly, the loadings are very short (I remember them being rather long between saves), and the textures and graphics are better than I remember them. Naturally the game wasn't made with the newer OS's and hardware in mind so take that in account when you're complaing. This was released in 99 so don't expect miracles.The story is pretty decent, not only because they tried to put a interesting story to follow in a TR game, but also because the story is connected with the next games, Chronicles and Angel of Darkness as they are direct sequels to TR4. I know not many people play TR for the story, but you have to praise the devs for allowing a bit more of plot. I mean, you know the story isn't the main focus here, but you know it's there. The setting is nice too.The gameplay aged somewhat bad. The controls are bad and dated. People like me enjoy them because we grew with those dull controls and we got used to them. Not much more to say about it. You have a few improvements over the previous games, like the ability of combining items and a handful of new moves. It's not too much. The big difference in TR4 is that is way bigger than the previous games.Besides that, this game IS hard. Particulary because It isn't like the games nowadays when they treat you like an idiot by putting everything in your face. Don't expect that this game is going to help you solving the riddles or telling you where you have to go next. You have to think and search a lot. Many of the riddles don't provide you with the clear and direct way to solve them. You have to find a way around them with more than what the game gives you. You can stay on a level searching for a key and you don't get where it's located because it's well hiden or it's part of a puzzle you don't understand how to solve. The lack of a map was a major difficult back in the time, personally I drew a map in a paper and checked the rooms I aready visited and searched, because you can feel lost in later levels or having the feeling you missed something like a pathway or a key element.But that is TR4 charm. Every step you achieve through your goal, solving the riddle and progressing withing the game, feels extremely good and rewarding. And when you can solve the riddle, you still have the traps. I forgot to tell that every corner of the pyramid and tomb levels are full with deadly traps, one wrong step, yes, you are dead. It's very challenging. The feeling of discovering a new room with a chain of obstacles waiting for Lara, a hidden tomb, opening a temple, are very nice if you're into exploration. And that is where TR really shines. And that's why I like this game so much.I can't recommend TR4 enough. And by 1,39€ it's unmissable. Looking aside the dull controls, grab it. If you liked the new TR from 2013 and you're buying this one on its behalf, don't do it! They are very different!"
,Recommended,224980,15727379,"Posted: 7 May, 2015",all,Hero One,"When it comes to the exciting outings of Lara, Core Design's 'The Last Revelation' is, for me, the pinnacle of the Tomb Raider series.As a fresh return to the series' roots, the fourth game focuses more on high adventure and exciting exploration, sending the player on an epic journey across ancient locations in Egypt to resolve a prophecy that spans millennia.Gone are gloomy London skylines and secret military installations of the previous two games. Instead of diving into underwater bases, Lara will delve into ancient tombs and mysterious ruins. You'll search for archaic artifacts instead of keycards, dodging devious traps and whirling blades, instead of laser wires and auto-turrets. The game still has plenty of frenetic gunplay, with new weapons, ammo choices and smarter enemies. But exploration and puzzles take centre stage here.The atmosphere is fantastic. You'll feel isolated as you tiptoe through dark corridors, treading where no foot as stepped for centuries. The graphics are a step up, but the sound makes the most impact. Musical cues still feature, but for the most part you'll hear nothing but your own footsteps, the wind rolling through passageways, and the occasional crumble of stones somewhere in the distance. Exploration has never been so exciting or tense!The game is well balanced. Tomb Raider 3 often had me wandering aimlessly around, not  sure where to go; Levels were completed almost by accident. Here, everything makes sense: You'll always know the item you need to proceed - even if you don't know where it is. The puzzles are challenging, but never tedious trial and error. A great feat, considering puzzles can span multiple levels and require multiple items. You'll rarely find yourself backtracking simply to see if you missed a hidden switch or obscure item.Overall, the game provides the series' best adventure. It gets the important parts right, and brings enough fresh features to keep the series interesting. Highly recommended."

,Recommended,224980,25486232,"Posted: 12 September, 2016",all,Bl4deMast3r,"20 years ago, Core Design presented us with Tomb Raider for the PC, Playstation and SEGA Saturn, featuring Lara Croft who become a very iconic character in the gaming community. In the following two years, Tomb Raider II: Starring Lara Croft and Tomb Raider III: Adventures of Lara Croft for the PC and Playstation. The PC also had expansions for these three games, which were released the same time each game was released. Tomb Raider: Unfinished Business, Tomb Raider II: The Golden Mask and Tomb Raider III: The Lost Artifact. Which unfortunately aren't on Steam.sad face :'cAnyway. In 1999, Core Design presented us this time with Tomb Raider: The Last Revelation, the 4th installment in the series. Which for many, felt like a whole new adventure back to what Tomb Raider is all about.Now for starters with this game, the first thing we can see is that even the menus were changed. Instead of that sort of item wheel we had in the first trilogy, we have something more simple. Which actually, I don't think it's really something that should be talked about like with too much detail. Except that probably for some, it makes the navigation simpler. But anyway, let's talk about the actual game.Now Tomb Raider: The Last Revelation is set before and at the same time, after Tomb Raider III. The game starts with a young Lara tagging along with Werner Von Croy, an archeologist she admired a lot when she was young and requested to tag along with him in an expedition to Cambodia. And this is pretty much the tutorial for the game. Unfortunately here, you don't get to visit Lara's huge mansion and stuff. And I have no idea if Core Design ever planned on including her home as a tutorial level or not. But anyway. Unfortunately, this expedition doesn't end well and Lara's the only one to make it out of the Angkor Wat ruins.A few years later, she decides to locate and enter the tomb of the egyptian god Set, to recover an artifact from there. However, she ends up releasing the evil god accidentally the moment she takes the artifact from Set's tomb. And it's up to Lara to undo this mistake in a race against time, in order to prevent Set from returning and spreading chaos and destruction through the world.Tomb Raider: The Last Revelation returned with new and smoother graphics, which can be noticed if you have played the previous three games. The objects and evironments now look less blocky.As for the gameplay, it hasn't changed much. You are now able to shimmy around corners, which you couldn't do in Tomb Raider III. The sprinting ability is back and this time you don't need to wait until the sprint gauge is fully refilled to use it. Something that is new to the game for example is that you can now do rope swinging, in order to reach a few areas in some levels.Some levels in the game also require backtracking in order to complete particular parts of the game. Which sort of gives some areas of the game the feeling that you're exploring one huge place with all sorts of tombs and other areas connected to each other. The game introduces new weapons and brings back a few old ones. Aside from the good old pistols, shotgun and uzis, the game brings back the grenade gun and introduces two new guns. The revolver and the crossbow. And these two weapons have something new to them, which is an attachable/detachable lasersight. Some weapons in the game this time like the shotgun, the grenade launcher and the crossbow have different types of ammunition, too. And the inventory also has a new system which allows you to combine items to make new ones, which is very important for a few puzzles in the game.The game of course, has its down sides. Although I've never encountered anything major, there are glitches that can be exploited for shortcuts. The game, like previous titles, also has secrets but this time, they don't really reward you with anything. They are useful pickups but you don't really unlock a bonus level nor you'll start the game with all weapons and infinite ammo, like how it used to be with previous games. So going after the game's 70 secrets is completely up to you. I personally think it's not worth it. I only find those I come across. And as for Windows 10 users, you'll probably have a little issue with the game's window. As it won't start in fullscreen, no matter what screen resolution you choose. But luckily there's a post on the Steam forums about a patch to fix that. I don't have the link at the moment, but you can find it easily. And it definitely fixes the issue, running the game in fullscreen.But even so, it's time for the final score. And honestly... I personally give this game a 9/10. I think it's well deserved. It's a great return to the series's roots and it's some darn good 30 hours, cuz the game REALLY IS that long. This is so far one of the longest games in the franchise. At least the classic franchise.Like how I did with Tomb Raider III, I highly recommend you getting this game. It's worth your money and worth your time! Whether you're new to the series or have been around since the classic titles were released. If you're looking for a good old game with good puzzles and some good action, this is a game you'll want to try. :D"

There's no big reason for that really, just a lot of little ones. If I had to pick the main thing I didn't like about The Last Revelation it would have to be that the puzzles are extremely difficult because of the backtracking you have to do through multiple levels. Since they're all connected now and not sectioned off it makes the levels incredibly huge. If you miss something and you don't know what it is you could be stuck for hours going through the level trying to figure out what it is.I just wasn't having fun when I was playing and it made me frustrated. And not in a ""This puzzle sure is hard, I'm gonna have fun trying to figure it out""-kind of way. But in the ""How was I supposed to know to do that?""-way. I had to use a walkthrough more times than I'd care to mention in this game in order to complete it.Other than that the lack of Lara's Home, unskippable (and sometimes unnecessary, like the ones showing you the level when you walk into it) cutscenes and an unusually gloomy mood in the final half of the game all came together to create an experience I didn't quite enjoy.You also can't press the view button when the camera shows you a cinematic angle in order to get the normal view back and that bothered me more than I thought it would. And who exactly had the bright idea to get rid of the item wheels and pool them all together into one large one with the health items and save icons as far away from each other as possible?But as a whole I think the game deserves a recommendation and the first half was quite enjoyable."

In addition the game puzzles require much more thought to complete than the previous games find key to lock approach to puzzle solving.In addition to solving the puzzle on of the large puzzle rooms, the game will also require the player to explore the game world to find parts in order to complete the puzzle giving the player a break from trying to solve a puzzle section of the game. Tomb raider 4 manages all its gameplay well as the mix between exploration, puzzle solving and combat.CombatCombat in this game is good with vastly different enemies types kitted with different weapons and with different weaknesses which makes the combat fresh and exciting throughout the game, unlike previous games the game does not have as much of a focus on combat as the previous games with exploration not being constantly interrupted with combat.The games difficulty is very balanced by providing a slow and steady difficulty curve throughout the game.Core design perfected their formula for the tomb raider series for this instalment making this my favourite game in one of my favourite gaming franchises. Tomb raider IV Is without a shadow of a doubt the best video game I have ever played, after returning to it many years later the game still holds up."

Ok, other than Lara having a Makeover and some swanky new lighting affects, the graphics haven't changed much at all over the last four games, the Gameplay is still more or less the same use of awkward controls, but there is still a diamond in the rough here. I was having fun!And then came levels like Alexandria.Whoever says Tomb Raider has good level design is lying or mad... or likely both. It consists of the most random level plans, unexplained puzzles (that even after reading Tutorials make absolutely no sense whatsoever in the context of the time, the language, the culture).Sorting out the random hieroglyphics into the English alphabet, and then putting it into alphabetical order. But Why? Why in alphabetical order to start with? There is no hint given as to why, it just is... but even worse... our Alphabet came into being a couple of thousand years after this tomb was built!So these great people of Egypt, with their time travel machines, glimpsed into the future, saw our Alphabet, then amazingly decided to change all of their language and hieroglyphics to be matching one of our letters (which essentially means that the Egyptians wrote in English, but used pictures as representation for each letter... no Core, that is not how it is. That is truly terrible puzzle design.Ah hell, why bother trying to even explain it.This game feels like something a 11 year old would make today in his lunch break at school. It feels like one persons over exited child was in charge of building levels, while the entire rest of the staff worked on the CGI films, that for it's time were pretty steller, to tie in some nonsensical plot that is very much from a time where games were not story tellers... ah hell, but they tried.So the levels are random, convoluted, blocky horribleness that have actually gotten worse with every single iteration of the series. I can hear the games director's demands:""New engine? NAH! new gameplay ideas? NAH! what we need is, LONGER, MORE COMPLICATED BUG RIDDEN LEVELS THAT NO ONE WILL BE ABLE TO COMPLETE WITHOUT A WALKTHROUGH."" ... Genius.Talking of which, to all the fans who will  undoubtedly vote me down, how many of you completed this game without a walk-through?Yeah, I can hear the tumble weeds bouncing down the street too.The only person who ever completed this without help, was the person who wrote the official walkthrough... but even that's not true, as he had help from Core. If the standard user can not finish your game without a walkthrough, no matter how smart you are (as these puzzles have absolutely NOTHING to do with intelligence) then you game is broken. There is no arguing around that.There is a reason that the beloved Tomb Raider, PSX's best original series died (as it was) along with Core. Good riddance!2/10 (and it only get's above a 1 because, well you know, Tomb Raider!)"

We never finished it back then, not until last year when I completed the Steam version - which is by far the best looking one. The atmosphere, the Egypt story and the old school platformer gameplay makes this arguably the best TR ever made. In some ways it's a scary game, you're alone and the focus is on exploring the environment, avoiding deadly traps while solving puzzles. If you thought the new TR was easy and too action oriented, I recommend playing this game. To put it another way; TR4 demonstrates an era of gaming when game developers made their games very challenging, a level of challenge that would trouble today's casual gamers, but definitely a very fun experience especially if you're a gamer from that era. 9/10"

Pretty much all of the levels are connected, now, and with the addition of the need to backtrack, this game is structured quite differently, almost a bit like a metroidvania, albeit without the vertical elements. Add to that several good additions like shattering pots with your gun, or aiming down a gun's sights, and this game's probably, nostalgia aside, the best entry in the first 6 Tomb Raider games."

Cause this game is exacly as it was for PS1, truste me i spend a lot of time trying to reach the end until i gave up, because i was only like 6 or 8 and couldnt understand the complexity of the puzzles nor could i control lara very well (still can't), and the game was so long with so many levels (yeah im from the time when u complained about the game beeing so damm long, now u hv 8 to 20h of gameplay, thats what seems to be the average).So if u love lara, like i doif u played all of her games, expecialy the older onesyeah buy this one, its the best, i repeat the BEST tomb raider yet, (and i didnt finished it, unlike all others) and is totaly worth it expecialy on sale"

It took me  over around 20 hours to complete the game, and that was without counting in the many times I died. So a big game is a plus, but it is not a very easy game to complete.The graphics of Lara Croft / Tomb Raider is now starting to look much better than in the previous game. She got the right curves, and she actually looks more sexy than the previosu game. Dat♥♥♥♥♥ If you have played through the 3 previous games you have seen Lara having a kinda square body.Graphically the game is alot better looking than the previous ones. It doesn't look ugly anymore, and the sound/music is as good as you can get it aswell!The progression in the game is something I felt was really slow at some point. You sit there thinking how in the hell are you gonna get past that place, even if you know where you are going. At some point in the game it was just pure dumb luck that got me past one of the REALLY weird ways to get further. I was like ""WTF! How are people gonna guess that?""Some things were also really hard, when I ran out of med kits, and I had to load multiple times to getting past a point with like 1-2% hp left! Also I realized later some weird bugs, where the small medkits didn't go into my bags, so I had to use the big ones in emergencies!Anyway! Game was pretty good, but really long and sometimes really hard! Graphically looks better than the 3 first, and the developers have created really interesting and variated levels.Go play it! You will like it...if you got the patience :P!I tried my best to not use a walkthrough, and I did that all through the game until I realised I missed an item. This was around one of the very last levels, and I realised that to get that item was too hard to guess.

Play any of the games before this one (though 3 can be just as annoying at times) and save yourself the time that you will need to complete this game ( a lot, I'd say 30 hours).The main difference between this and Chronicles is that the latter is shorter and thus more bearable but is even more infuriating than this. Nothing is telegraphed correctly, you will be stuck in places and just look desperatly for something you will wonder entire levels behind just to realize you missed a tiny little thing that is so random you probably just mashed the action button until you picked something up or an action was available with said object.
