,Recommended,225000,11707635,"Posted: 14 August, 2014",all,nerdfury,"If you're reading this, you have probably already tried at least one of the other Tomb Raider games, and are wondering, ""How will I react to Tomb Raider 5: Chronicles compared to the other Tomb Raider game(s) I have played?"". I will try to review Chronicles based on its quality relative to the other classic games in the series (i.e. the ones developed by Core).Compared to the first four classic games, Chronicles is fairly short and (for me) probably the easiest out of the five ""Core classics"". I enjoyed the varied settings in the game's 13 levels, and I think the developers did a great job in creating a suspenseful atmosphere despite a dated graphics engine relative to that time period of PC gaming. To support this atmosphere, there are plenty of varied puzzles (although they are nowhere near as difficult as Tomb Raider 3's puzzles), good use of ambient sound effects to set the mood, an emphasis on exploration and, for a number of levels, a fun avoidance/stealth-based mechanic where the clunky combat is non-existent.Chronicles is split into four locations and unfortunately I feel that only the first location (Rome) has that traditional tomb-raiding feel which I so dearly love. I don’t mind the occasional “modern-day” level; however I felt that Chronicles was a bit too heavy on modern-day exploration (more than half of the levels are in modern-day settings). This is a matter of taste, but one of the things I really appreciated about some of the older Tomb Raider games was getting immersed in the lore of Ancient or lost civilizations. So, while the atmosphere of Chronicles is overall still suspenseful and well-crafted, I felt that the game lacked that “epic feeling” that certain levels of previous Tomb Raider games provided (I’m looking at you, Temple Ruins of Tomb Raider 3 and St. Francis’ Folly of Tomb Raider 1).TLDR: Chronicles is a decent “classic” Tomb Raider game, despite it being relatively short and easy, and lacking a certain epic atmosphere that all 4 previous games possessed. I would only recommend it if you have played some of the other classics (i.e. 1-4) and are just looking to add to your collection for a very cheap cost ($6.99 for approximately 10 hours of gameplay). If you’re completely new to the series and are looking to start your Tomb Raider experience, start with Tomb Raider 1, or, if you can’t tolerate the outdated graphics of the Core classics, start with Tomb Raider: Legend developed by Crystal Dynamics.Just for reference, here’s how I would rate Tomb Raider 5: Chronicles relative to the other classic Tomb Raider games I have played, from best to worst:Tomb Raider 1Tomb Raider 3 (Read my review)Tomb Raider: AnniversaryTomb Raider: LegendTomb Raider 2 (Read my review)Tomb Raider 5Tomb Raider: UnderworldTomb Raider 4(I haven’t played Angel of Darkness)"
,Recommended,225000,8017302,"Posted: 12 December, 2013",all,Cpt.Ziltoid,"In this game you play 4 different Lara's adventures: her search for the Philosopher's Stone in Rome, her hunt for the Spear of Destiny (imo, this is the best level of Chronicles), her adventure on the Black Isle (only puzzles on this one, 'cause you play with a younger Lara who doesn't use guns yet) and the final level is her infiltration on Werney Von Croy's high-tech complex to retrieve the Iris Artefact (the one you see at the beginning of The Last Revelation).Even though TR: Chronicles isn't as good as its predecessors, it still is a great game. Chronicles uses the same engine from The Last Revelation, which improved Lara's movements, making it much easier to play, but the graphics are still the same (not a bad thing, it's really good for a PS1-era game). The variety of the scenarios got my attention here: you go from the Coloseum to the deep of the ocean to the island of Lost, among others. I highly recommend this if you're a fan of the series, but if you're just starting to play the old TR games, check out TR 2 and The Last Revelation first (I know some people don't like TLR, but it was my first TR game so it has a special place in my heart). The only really bad thing is the save bug on the last minutes of the game, so make sure you don't save only on one slot and search on the internet where the bug starts to cause problems and you'll be good to go."
,Recommended,225000,8035256,"Posted: 13 December, 2013",all,SanctionBless,"Tomb Raider Chronicles received mixed reviews and was criticized for the fact that ""it started becoming more of the same"" and I agree; both this and TR4 utilize the same game engine and TR2 and 3 utilized a similar engine, this is very easy to notice in game. Although I agree with this, I will be reviewing Chronicles as a game in its own respective right and disregard its predecessors.The game on the whole acts as a memorial tribute to Lara Croft who is presumed dead (after the events of TR4). The game is comprised of 13 levels which are split into 4 ""acts"". Each act tells a story of one of Lara's many past adventures, reminisced by her butler and past friends. Her adventures vary from her quest in search of the Philosopher's stone in Rome to infilrating a high-security tower block in New York to steal the Iris. There is a fair amount of variety in the game that stops it from getting bland and boring.The vital, important aspect that's always held up well in the Tomb Raider games are the puzzles in them; whilst the puzzles in Chronicles aren't as complex and mind-boggling as the puzzles in the previous games (especially TR4) there are still there and keeps you constantly thinking and questioning in the game.In terms of the graphics in the game, there isn't much to say, as mentioned it utilizes the same engine as TR4 and therefore looks exactly the same in terms of graphic detail. For a 2000 game, it really doesn't look that bad.Sound was another aspect of Chronicles that was criticized, with it being viewed as mediocre; I personally slightly agree with this, the sound in Chronicles doesn't exactly stand out, it is very ambient and takes the ""back seat"" for the majority of the game, only in particular flybys or boss fights that there is distinctive music. A lot of music has also been reused from The Last Revelation, which is slightly disappointing.The game itself is very short compared to the previous games, it took me only 5 hours to beat however I have played the game countless times in the past (I grew up around this game) so it may take a new player slightly longer. Is there a lot of replay value in the game? Not really, there are secrets in each level which are quite hard to find/gain access to and finding all of them will unlock some special features from the menu. However, finding all secrets would require you to play through the entire game again if you miss one as there is no level select and finding them all only unlocks concept and cinematic art, so is it really worth it?Despite the mediocre sound and shortness of the game, I would recommend this game. Is it my nostalgia recommending it? Yes and no; I believe new players will find the game engaging and puzzling from start to finish there's quite a bit of variety and challenge in the game, don't be expected to just gun the bosses down, there is some challenge involved and skill needed and I feel that makes it worthy of the £4.99 that it costs."

Well, my opinion is mixed. I liked the first levels (Rome) and Ireland the most. Nice scenery and story. Russian base and submarine was interesting. But the final levels in the complex were really not my style + buggy as hell. Last level (red alert!) especially. Overall i would give the game grade 7/10."

,Recommended,225000,9758322,"Posted: 7 April, 2014",all,Dfactor,"TR5 is the last oldschool Tomb Raider game. It features the same visuals as Tomb Raider 4 and also includes some new moves.Chronicles tells us four stories about Lara's previous adventures (the events before The Last Revelation). The Rome is set before Tomb Raider 1 (1996), Russia is somewhere in the middle, Ireland when Lara was 16 (same age as in TR4's Cambodia levels), New York (when she decided to steal Cambodia's Iris from Von Croy).The game is somewhat notably shorter than the previous parts, but it features some variety. Rome was similar to TR2's Venice style adventures. Russian submarine was similar to TR3's modern vibe. Ireland is quite a unique experience, you could even tag it as survival horror. VCI headquarters is more similar to The Angel of Darkness concept of modern Tomb Raiding.Unlike TR4 the TR5 is completely linear, you can't go back between the levels and on top of that each time you finish a chapter (on of four) all your items are gone. On the bright side that prevents item hoarding. The game has 36 secrets. Collecting all unlocks game's concept art.TR5 has native widescreen support. There's no need to patch it.In a perfect world this should be played after finishing:- Tomb Raider (I)- Tomb Raider: Unfinished Business- Tomb Raider II- Tomb Raider II: The Golden Mask- Tomb Raider III: Adventures of Lara Croft- Tomb Raider III: The Lost Artifact- Tomb Raider IV: The Last Revelation- Tomb Raider IV: Exclusive Times Level"
,Recommended,225000,8958301,"Posted: 2 February, 2014",all,LucasSM20,"Tomb Raider: Chronicles, as it name said, was a Tomb Raider game launch for PC and PS1 with a try to explore many different Lara's adventures. But did he made it? Well, we will discover it on this review.First, i need to say: When i firstly played this game, i found it pretty good. But by the time i've played it i was way younger. Today, my opinion as changed a bit. Let's go to the topics.Graphics: This game uses the same engine from Tomb Raider 4: The Last Revelation, with a little improvement over the textures. Overall, they're pretty good to look at and does it job for a Tomb Raider game.Soundtrack: Overall, pretty forgetable. The only music i could remember was the menu music. And that's it. And i really mean it. Music is almost not present on gameplay, most of time you will only hear ambient sounds, like in the previous game. But at least i felt that in the previous title, it felt more present. The only times i heard music were during the cutscenes, but most of them were ""suspense music"" and not really catchy. Witch let me down since Tomb Raider is a game known for it's orchestred music track.Gameplay: It pretty much remained the same from the fourth title, it only added a few new moves. Lara could run, jump, climb almost everywhere, and fall down through vents while crouched and looking forward (In the old game, you could only do that if you rotated 360).Gunplay is the same from the fourth title, featuring the manual aim from the combination of Revolver + Laser Sight. But not only it. As the game tried to bring new weps, guess what...DESERT EAGLE IS BACK! Yeah! After a whole game without it, i can't express how i missed it so much. It kills enemies with one shoot, holy mackina. Finally.Also, many other new guns were introtuced, especially at the VCI levels. And in these levels, were present a stealth mode. For the very first time in a Tomb Raider game, you could only kill enemies without being detected (Because you lost you weapons at these levels). Different from other levels were you got no weps, you could at least make your way to kill all the enemies.New enemies were introduteced, as well a new level of teen Lara. Everything works fine and it's well constructed. This game is more puzzle-like than the fourth one. But if i can say something from this game is that its SHORT.It could be bigger and i will tell you why at the end of the review.Also: Secrets are back. But finding them is a pain. Because your statistcs are not per stage, but global. You can't know witch stage has a secret neither how many one level has. If this game wasn't that short, it would be a pain getting it all.I can't remember if TR 4 was like that, so i can't say anything about it.Cheats in this game are a little different from the fourth one and harder to do. But they still exist.A stage consists of getting to point A to B or completing certain tasks to do so, not many problems. There are mini bosses throught some stages and they aren't that challenging. No real boss at the end tough (Trapping him feels the same as trapping Seth), witch felt a bit empty.There are a few unlockables at this game as you find the secrets, they all had screenshoots of the next gen of Tomb Raider witch was...TRAOD. Damn, it just ain't worth when you already know the finished product.Story: Here was the weakest point of this game. At least, for me. The CANON MAIN TIMELINE of Tomb Raider pretty much remains UNTOUCHED. The only thing revealed at the end of the game, surprise, surprise, Lara is still alive. In the CANON NOT MAIN TIMELINE, pretty much nothing is explored from Lara's past, except for the young stage. But even there, not much is explored. It just feels that they put Lara's on random adventures with an excuse. And this game also has a big hole conection between him and TRAOD. Vernom was the one who discovered Lara was alive, searching for her all the days of many months. But when you start TRAOD, Lara says: ""You left me on Egypt"". HOW?! Damn. Another thing that's never explained is how Lara survived from the TR4 ending. At least in the game. In the book series, there's one book that explain how. I never read it, so i can't say anything, but it's there.Focusing on the adventures on Lara's ""chronicles"", it divided in four acts.The first one, Lara is looking for the phylosophy stone, with a little ""help"" of Pierre and Larson. The only strange thing on this chapter is the Pierre fall. How the hell did he survived it? We already knew in Tomb Raider 1 that Lara knew Larson and Pierre from a long time before, that matches. But Pierre falling to his death...What the hell?!The second one, Lara is in a russian ship looking for the spear of destiny. See what they are doing? Random stories. The only good thing at this chapter was the ship's captain. I felt bad for him at the end. Damn.The third one, is the young stage. Lara sneaks into a Winston's friend boat to uncover a secret from a cursed island. Even if the premises looks idiot, this one has the most well constructed atmosphere, mostly because of you being without your weapons, like a true adventurer.The fourth and last one was about how Lara stealed Iris from Van Croy. It was the mostly overrated stage and it was all worth it. It was so shorth tough that i felt bad when i was about to end it. Damn. Really.The Level Editor: This is where this game could've been a lot more revolutionary. You see, random stories for random levels with random enemies. Sounds like a thing you do while doing mods or maps for some game, doesn't it?The PC version got a exclusive Level Editor that allowed the players to make their own levels and even full games. If you acess a site called ""Lara's Level Base"" you will see there's a lot of levels made by players. And they are still being made until today. Why is it bad? Read again: PLAYERS.Players made the community, players made their site for their levels/new items for the engine (Witch you could add) and players made this whole ""Let's make a Tomb Raider game ourselfs"" worth.The devs couldn't see how much the community could have used this more. There was no real support for the Level Editor and after its launch, there were no patchs whatsoever. If the player base din't kept it alive, nobody would be using. But if the devs gave the right attention to it, it could've been something BIG and NEW. Nobody ever tough of making his own Tomb Raider adventures, and that would bring something new. Mostly because the engine is not hard like Unreal or Source (And not easy as Portal 2 PTI i might say) and, for its time, it was still a good engine. They missed a big oportunity here. The game was rather sort and they din't even bothered giving a extended lifetime, at least on PC. When they launched the Level Editor for free, they pretty much gave up. Because you CAN use the engine to PLAY ALL THE LEVELS made by players WITHOUT NEEDING TO OWN THE GAME!I guess for today, this is fine. But, the engine was released for free in the same day that the game came out. Jesus.I remember the purple ""Level Editor"" disk that came with my original TR 5 CD, i felt so special by having something like that at my hand and was sad to see it was free on the new. Legaly. With a manual too. Jesus, why?Overall, TR: Chronicles is the mostly forgetable Tomb Raider and the shortest of all, but it was a fun game to play...While it lasted.Getting all the secrets and playing with the Level Editor will keep youself busy more than the game itself, sadly. But it's not bad, it could've been better. They just missed a good oportunity here. Only if they gave more support to the level editor...If you want to play this game, be preapared for fun and disapointment, at the same time.PS: Why did these ""Next Gen Screens"" looked so promising back there? Damn."

The game itself is not as good as previous titles and shorter in comparison, but to me that doesn’t make it bad. It took me about seven hours to play.By today’s standards the game play is extremely outdated, the controls are wonky, and the graphics are basically junk. However back in the day, it wasn’t too bad. I remember playing this as a little kid on Windows 98 and loving it. In fact the control scheme came back to me rather quickly.I would highly recommend this game for nostalgia, or if you’ve played the classic Tomb Raider series and know what to expect. Other than that, you would have to have a good appreciation for old computer games to enjoy playing this."

Not only is the level design uninspired, very basic and just plain boring at times, the four little episodic stories are absolutely horrendous. This game feels more like something a single hobby developer put together in a week than an actually official Tomb Raider title.It does have its moments and some levels and designs aren't quite as bad and lackluster as others but overall it's a very dull, short and often times downright annoying and buggy experience that you can skip if you're not a completionist or fan of the series.On a scale of 1 to 10 I give Chronicles a 3 for trying to implement at least a few unique ideas and new gameplay mechanics that haven't been seen before in a Tomb Raider game."

I've encountered incredible amounts of bugs, making me unable to finish.In the last areas:- Lara does not aim at enemies with her weapon (she has only one in these levels by the way), needless to say this bug makes it annoying to shoot at enemy with rafle mode selected, ending up wasting ammo;- Lara got stuck in a cinematic, making her unable to get her weapon back;- Lara got stuck in the elevator area, leading to death up or down;- The first cyborg got immortal, revealing his electric arm and releasing water didn't kill him;- Basically, saving and loading in the last area is VERY bad idea, most of spots are bugged.Other than that, I really do love this game, especially the Rome area, because we get to kill giant statues. We love moving statues. And when we get to play Lara as a teenager. A terrifying set of levels, with no guns and creepy creatures.There are few ways to go past these bugs if you look around on the internet (check out Stella's website for example). But I still haven't figure out how to solve the problem with the gun automatic aim.I do recommend it though! Even if it's not as good as the other series.(The screenshots shown in the preview are wrong though, Lara is not going in Egypt in this game!)"

It's set after Tomb Raider IV, when Lara's supposed to have died (I won't ruin the surprise, but there's a Tomb Raider VI after this one ;-)   It's chopped up into small stories, which break up the game into nice little episodes set at different times and in different locations.   The original Tomb Raiders can really drag sometimes, but this one has good pacing, an interesting story, and there's just enough variety to keep you interested.   It does have a few bugs, though, which can be a pain, but they're easily avoided if you keep a walkthrough handy.   As with all the original series TR's, level design and low poly models are really starting to show their age now, which is a shame, but it's a good member of the series, and a great trip down memory lane.

I played all of the games, up to The Last Revelation, before life got in the way and I haven't played any other game since, until now :) Purchasing a new PS4 game console for my 6 YO son and becoming a fan of a lowbrow/pop surreal artist who has done some videogame fanart has inspired me to come back to the world of gaming and happily immerse myself again.Of course, I'm wanting to play many games (and have already purchased over 100 of them on sale - being an adult DOES have it's perks), but I really wanted to start where I left off, which leads me to Chronicles. I have only played for a few hours today, so I'm sure I'll want to update this review at some later date but I just wanted to give a slight review of the game from the perpective of someone with children and responsibilities and as someone who has forgotten many of the talents I garnered in the past...First of all 2 things....If you are person who hasn't played a game in over a decade, like me and you are attempting to turn your computer into a console by purchasing an XBox360 controller, so that you can really pick up where you left off... please understand that  controller support has it's limits. Chronicles purports to offer full controller support, but when I go into options and select ""joystick"" and go back into the game... All Lara does is run around in circles (can't seem to get her to stop) and pull flares! It's okay, I wanted to learn how to game with a keyboard/mouse anyway, but I really didn't want to do that on an adventure game. I just wanted to sit back, relax and enjoy the story without being so clumsy and having to try failed maneuvers over and over again. I've read that controller support is way better in some of the newer version of TR, so I can't wait to try and see.Second, incase you've forgotten! Don't wait until the end of the level for your game to be saved! I made it all the way through level 1 and was about to walk through the Bell Temple door, when I was sent off on another side mission, via a walkthrough, when I missed a jump and lost my life. 15 years ago, this would have been just frustrating, but it would have slid off of my back... but as an adult, with children to feed, a house to keep clean and a business to run... I wanted to cry and vow to never throw away another 4 hrs of my life like that again.The game is just as I remember it (so far) but I just wish I didn't have the ""you could be doing something else"" angel whispering in my ear, because that makes it so much harder to enjoy the game now. But, that's a personal fault(?) and has nothing to do with the game. I would imagine the game makers assumed that users had the time to spare. I still think the graphics are very cool and they do help me to escape a bit, but I've got to be honest, I've seen the graphics on many of the newer games I've purchased, including the newer Tomb Raider titles and I really can't wait to play them."

The puzzles and levels are the easiest and most linear in the series so far and that was fun for a while but it got old in the second part of the game and along with a couple of irritating bugs it made for an underwhelming experience.Especially the bug at the end of the game that damn near stopped me from finishing the level. I was only able to complete the game because I rotated my saves.I won't spoil the ending cutscene but it was quite disappointing and that was the final nail in the coffin for me in regards to this feeling more like an expansion pack rather than a full game.I know I complained about the insane difficulty in the fourth game but this one was so easy and short it felt like a step backwards to be honest.

,Recommended,225000,35360647,Posted: 30 September,all,PookPunk,"Tomb Raider: Chronicles is linear and quite short. It took me roughly 5-6hrs. The level environments are small in scale compared to Tomb Raider 1-4 and feel more compact. Honestly, this made it harder to maneuver Lara through tight corridors, or perhaps the game responded awkwardly to my Xbox controller. However, my Xbox controller works fine with Tomb Raider 2-4 (the original game requires Xpadder).The game is presented decently, but there is no story in Chronicles. Instead, the game is divided into four sections that recount some of Lara’s past adventures.The first section are the Rome levels that provide throwbacks to the original Tomb Raider and some Tomb Raider 2 Venice vibes (without the speed boat). These levels focus on exploration and puzzles mostly.The second section is Russia and these levels pronounce all the action elements from the series. The Russia portion reminded me of the offshore rig and diving levels from Tomb Raider 2.The fourth section takes a younger Lara introduced at the beginning of Tomb Raider: The Last Revelation and strands her on a haunted Irish isle without weapons. These sections are very survival horror based with lots of puzzle solving. This portion of the game was my favorite as the levels were atmospheric and did something different for the series.The last section takes place in a high-tech skyscraper in New York City. These levels resembled the Area-51 levels from Tomb Raider 3 and focus more on stealth sequences. These levels are the most challenging in the game. Also, the last level “Red Alert” is very buggy. Certain bugs can prevent the player from finishing the level, so it’s a good idea to have multiple saves. And save frequently!While the Russia and VCI skyscraper sections are slight improvements from the contemporary levels from Tomb Raider 2 and 3, neither live up to the franchise name. Still, these levels are straight forward enough and presented better via the in-game cutscenes and Hollywood inspired approach. The game design in Chronicles is never intelligent like it was in The Last Revelation, nor does it ever feel as challenging like Tomb Raider 3.Overall, Tomb Raider Chronicles is rather average. The first section is too linear and easy. It’s a far cry to what Tomb Raider 1-4 are. The environments are dense and lack the scale as big of previous installments. For that reason alone, makes Chronicles a tad lackluster, but there are still a slew of entertaining gimmicks and challenges in Chronicles.PROS:+The Ireland levels remain the best section in the game+Decent presentationCONS:-Last level (Red Alert) very buggy-Rome levels are too linear and easy-Environments lack the scale of the previous games"

And some of them are a bit confusing even after completing first 4 games in the series.I can see that developers started experimenting with things with some hits and misses. Horror for example, on the spooky island scared the hell out of me. I prefer adventure over horror but it was still OK. Mechanics like sniping was a blast because for the first time I could do headshots.The game is quite a bit shorter than previous ones and the reason it took me a while to complete it was some of those puzzles that made much less sense then before.If you are a fan of Tomb Raider series like me the by all means go ahead and buy it."

It's easy to see how, at the time, a fifth Tomb Raider game in five years, which added few changes could be seen as downright insulting - almost as antiquated as any of the tombs within.Replaying it now, over 15 years later, it's easy to look back with rose-tinted glasses and talk about how it follows the classic formula. Unfortunately, it follows that formula too closely, in fact, it's the most generic Tomb Raider in the franchise, and frankly, the only one I didn't look forward to replaying.4/10."

However, we all just couldn't get enough of Lara Croft and thus we got Chronicles which was blatantly thrown together and boy does it really show.In terms of gameplay, it's more or less the same as the previous games but admittedly, I really liked that they gave you the ability to roll out forwards through a crawlspace instead of having to turn around just to get down and that's literally the one good thing I can say about this game. There are many badly designed levels such as Russia where half of the time you are going through corridors in a submarine and then there's two minutes of exploring in the open water. The last level of the game is heavily bugged which the only way to counter them is to not save at all in certain parts because it will screw you over if you load up the game there.Story-wise. we are given four different adventures of Lara Croft through her years but the first part they bring back Larson and Pierre from the first game which doesn't make any sense at all. This even takes place before TR1 so they made a massive plothole just from that. According to the trailer, Lara infiltrates the Russian base in 1984 which is where she would be only 16. Yeah, not buying that. Her trip to Ireland takes place in 1979 with her backpack yet she doesn't actually get that until she went to Cambodia with Von Croy in 1984 so... yeah, continuity errors everywhere. That shows how badly thought out they were for the story.Would only recommend this game if you intend to play through all the Tomb Raider games. Otherwise, not really worth the time."

In another mission, you're in some hi-tech facility with mission impossible type gear trying to steal back the ""Iris"" artifact from one of your old rivals.

It's not structured like a single complete game, instead it's more of a collection of smaller almost expansion set worthy adventures. While these adventures were short, I thought they were at least interesting and most importantly fun. The Ireland levels were particularly memorable because they were spookier than any others in the TR franchise. Each story is quick and fun, and each reveals a bit more about Lara's past and character. So I welcome this game as a worthy addition to the franchise, even if its structure isn't ideal.Unfortunately, like TR2 & 4, this game is forced into a window in Windows 8...so I won't recommend it... otherwise I would."

The worst part is:THE SAVE STATE BUGSThese developers seem to need a crash course in state transition development. I won't go into details, but if you play this game you must continually save in staggered save slots because when you save a game and then load it again, it doesn't always load in the same state you saved it in. Neccesary enemies may not spawn, switches may not be activated any more, water may not be drained...the last level is the worst for this.Just DO NOT overwrite saves unless they are old. Cycle through every time you save so you can always go back to before a trigger problem occurs.You have been warned."

The first thing I noticed is the appearent lack of graphical improvement. However this is not critical as it is an old game. However, the background story is absolutely horrible, illogical and barely understandable. The last level was so difficult that I ran out of medics and could not complete it. A large part of the game relies on the player's ability to master the long jump to the cm, and after breaking Lara's legs for the hundredth time I had enough of it. I found the puzzles sometimes interesting, but many puzzles do not rely enough on logics but rather on ""try and fail"" until you exhaust every possible interaction with the game environment.What would you say about a game that you abandon at the last level with the bitter sensation to have wasted time?"

However there are interesting things in this game which makes it appears on the list of my favorite Tomb Raider games.In Rome, we can see a little bit of story that fills the background story to the characters  Larson and Pierre.In Ireland, there is a feeling of nostalgia by playing Lara in her 16 years old again, like in TR4. However there are the creepiest small beings ever (in my opinion) in certain parts.In New York, we have an urban level. I really like urban levels on Tomb Raider, but in this game is even more iconic than the urban levels in TR3. Lara's black catsuit + glasses in a high tech building of Von Croy's industries it's... more than epic <3Plus we can see the Iris artifact again, even though Core Design didn't gave a good and long background story to it.I really like this game, especially the last levels."

The fate of Lara in the last game was unclear, as in this game her friends believe that she is dead and end up recounting stories of her previous adventures. All of the game play focuses on a series of four different flashbacks, while the present day events are only shown in the FMVs. The game show cases slightly more improvements on the gameplay while the graphics are about the same. Levels are hard at times, but anyone who's played these games will know what to expect. I am a fan of origin stories so I do enjoy the concept of a game that delves into other adventures Lara had besides the adventures we already seen her in the previous games."

The storyline is not really that interesting as its just about Lara's past adventures. But of course its not like they simply added levels from previous games. No no, they added levels in which we dont remember playing. Characters we might be familar with in some storylines (as they are told from Lara's past adventures, so which means during some people you might be familar with that is still alive). I cant remember, but i believe theres some people you are familar with in some past games. Pretty sure there is.Anyways, with that said i would as well recommend it because even though the levels seems rather shorter than the rest, it still gives off interesting puzzles opposing to having puzzles you already solved in the past.Oh also, a fair warning to all of you on the final level as it contains MANY glitches. I suggest preparing lots of saves in case if you encounter a glitch to prevent starting ALL over from beginning."

THAT happened after TR VI (Angel of Darkness) due to the developer switch (gladly, Tomb Raider: Legend fixed that...).So TR V gets a lot of hate for some whatever reason. I never really quite understood why it got the hate. I've never encountered any bugs and the story line is just amazing imo. The soundtrack is just phonomonal and it will never cease to surprise me. Tomb Raider V had such a heavy and sad tone to it- but I LOVED that about it.Tomb Raider V starts off where Tomb Raider IV left off, so IURGUE YOU TO PLAY TOMB RAIDER IV: THE LAST REVELATION BEFORE PLAYING THIS GAME.Otherwise, the story will make NO SENCE to you.So I'm going to tell you how it starts off, but if you have not played Tomb Raider IV: The Last Revelations- don't worry- I will make this part unviewable unless you hover your mouse over it.Here goes-So, after Vernen leaves you in the temple, Lara is presumed dead and a memorial service is held for her- even though she is not officially dead. Winston quotes,""Let us hope she may return to us"" in the intro scene. So Lara is going incognito for most of the game (not sure if she actually shows herself or not, never finished the game) if you haven't caught on yet.Gameplay: It's almost exactly like Tomb Raider IV: The Last Revelation, so if you didn't like TR IV, then don't play Chronicles unless you want to follow the storyline. It's not BAD by any means, it's just quite different if you're used to the original Tomb Raider I, II, and III games because it's based off a new game engine.Graphics: It looks amazing- the new engine for TR IV and TR V looks goregous, but it can look pretty bad mixed in with low-res textures as present in some levels. The good part about TR V is that the graphics, resolution, and many more options are changable unlike TR I, and II.Conclusion: 2nd most favorite Tomb Raider game to date. Definintely has more harder puzzles to solve, but are solvable without walkthroughs. 9/10"
