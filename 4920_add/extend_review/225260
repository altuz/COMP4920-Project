,Recommended,225260,14193941,"Posted: 27 January, 2015",all,F4rseeR,"What do you do when you are on the game’s store page? You buy it, install it and play it. Once you initiate the third process, you won’t need convincing on keeping on doing it.  The game is entertaining, detailed even where you don’t expect it, the npc’s are loveable, the open world big enough to lose yourself in it. What was a surprise that made me skeptic at first but turned out to be another enjoyable feature was the “casual” RTS, where from the protagonists third person that turns into a flying demon you command your various troops to take out towers and ultimately, the stage, by implementing your tactics. I wasn’t a fan of metal when I started playing this game, but because of it, I have all the metal songs from this game in my playlist.http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=382331717You are Eddie Riggs, the best roadie in the world, which means you are the one responsible for the stage glamour, but no one will know it. As things get out of control, you find your way into the past, into the age of metal, where people are used against their will by a tyrant which servers Doviculus, the demon responsible for the taint that corrupts all what metal stands for. Since Eddie is good at making things work and gives people purpose, a revolution is started. There will be many great characters that you’ll meet along the way, many of which are based on real life metal stars.  There is always a romantic sub plot where you might find some clichés, but they are the best kind. Since the story takes place in an open world, you can expect a lot of variation in locations and types of allies and enemies.There are a lot of sidequests and neither are the fetch types, more like ambushing, hunting, racing, keeping the bikers away while a headbanger charms a girl, shooting from a ramped car, placing markers for the guy with no aim to shoot rockets, that sort of stuff. Once I had to clear a cave so that a family of bats could go back in, which earned me kisses and an apology from a bat for ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ on my head. There are solos to find, serpents to free and legends to learn. It’s the kind of open world that never fills empty.http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=382331029In the RTS missions, you’ll use your solos and your cunning, for doing things like melting your enemies faces and send the invisible forces to attack the stage while the shooters and the pyromans defend your stage.  The Deuce(your car) is fun to drive, but the controls may prove to be difficult at first, which makes it even more fun.  You can raise relics, which include Motorfoges, where you will  upgrade your attack, the Deuce, change outfits, enhance your weapons and buy stones to place on a mountain.If you’re a fan of the RTS system in the game, you can expect a good time in the multiplayer.http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=382329151I found many of my favorite gaming moments here. While people find some faults in this game, everyone finds the way to play this game and others don’t recognize those faults at all. The end was emotional satisfying, sneaking away, yet finding yourself surrounded by friends that simply ask you to never forget them at which point you’d likely say that you won’t, then driving into the sunset while your girlfriend watches smiling and dropping a tear.  You can free roam afterwards to see what more this game has to offer. I’m not done with it and I don’t want to, not until I hear of a sequel at least. In the end, I find Brütal Legend to do everything right."
,Recommended,225260,16964593,"Posted: 9 July, 2015",all,Toxic League,"I grew up listening to hard rock and metal. So when I started playing Brütal Legend, I wondered how the hell this game fell under my radar for so long. Thankfully Double Fine decided to port this game to the PC otherwise I likely would have never had the pleasure to experience this treasure.There's so much great music to listen to while driving ""The Deuce."" Songs from Black Sabbath, Mötley Crüe, Testament, Megadeth, Slayer, Skid Row, and so many more artists are in the mix. The music is great enough to overlook even a bad game. But this is not a bad game. Brütal Legend is a fantastically fun game. The story is epic taking the role as a roadie to save the world from the forces of evil. The open world action/adventure gameplay works amazingly well with guitar solos and cooperative special moves.The only thing I had a hard time with was the stage battles. They combine 3rd person hack 'n slash action with RTS elements and require some serious multitasking. I struggled to command my troops and purchase stage upgrades in real time, all while simultaneously trying to fight off hordes of enemies. I eventually got through them, although sometimes painfully. Despite being difficult, the stage battles were still fun and blended well with the metal based story and themes.Ozzy Osbourne, Lemmy Kilmister, Rob Halford, and Lita Ford are in this! Did I mention Ozzy? YES OZZY!If you are a metal head, this game is a must. Even if you aren't, the game is a must."
,Recommended,225260,18453942,"Posted: 13 October, 2015",all,talgaby,"Short version: 72%Brütal Legend is awesome and metal. Brütal Legend is also a mediocre and forgettable open world/hack & slash/strategy game. A prime example why Steam needs a “meh” button for the reviews.Long version:Brütal Legend is a tribute to metal. Not cash-in whiny pop metal, but real, classic, early seventies, head-banging, engine-worshipping, leather-winged heavy metal. It is a temple for bands like Black Sabbath, Judas Priest, or Motörhead– just to name a few from the in-game soundtrack.This game is so metal that its cast has such names as Jack Black as the protagonist, Rob Halford as the first main boss, and Ozzy Osbourne as the shopkeeper. This game is so metal that the entire landscape is never-ending scenery of heavy metal album covers. This game is probably as metal as metal you can get without dipping your computer in molten steel.Brütal Legend is also incredibly mediocre. It wants to combine three genres: GTA style open world exploration/driving, hack & slash brawling, and real-time strategy. The problem is that it isn’t remotely good in any of those.The brawling is dumb, although fun: you mindlessly mash two buttons and hope that the enemy runs out of health faster than you do.The RTS part consists of spawning an endless stream of units until one army reaches the end of the battlefield to wreck the opponent’s production stage. To be frank, it is downright boring.Still, the driving takes the cake. The controls are worse than you can imagine (worse than Borderlands could ever be), and when you have to race on narrow platforms over bottomless pits… get yourself a pack of Xanax.I wouldn’t call Brütal Legend bad… the soundtrack and most of the plot about leading a metal-fuelled revolution against the demon-like oppressors can easily entertain you from start to finish, but you will always have the feeling that the game mechanics could have been a lot better."

,Recommended,225260,15891003,"Posted: 18 May, 2015",all,Tom,"Brutal Legend is a mash up of a couple different genres, Action Adventure Open World RTS...yes, that many...I'll start out with the graphics, it is a nice art style however the graphics really show the three years difference, even on higher resolutions the game doesn't look as crisp as others. There is hardly any customization in the options menu to try get a bit more beef out the graphics which is almost a must for PC ports.The actual game play is nicely done though, as I said to begin with, there are four different genres mashed up here, Action Adventure is done very well, the hack and slash mechanics are basic, but the addition of guitar solos brings a whole new way of playing, allowing you to buff up your characters or deal damage to your foes.  The open world aspect is also done very well, the world seems huge, there are plenty of side quests to keep you busy throughout the story, however these aren't crucial for story or game progress elements, and they are purely there as additional things to do.  Finally, the RTS element, throughout the course of the game, you will take part in a number of grand scale battles, in which you have to manage your resources (fans in this case) and build an army in which you command using basic squad game controls, so follow, defend and attack. To me this seemed like the worst of the four though, it seemed a little clunky and out of place, I would much rather have played it without the strategy side.The sound track and music in Brutal Legend is obviously going to be amazing. The game features 107 metal tracks from 75 different bands, ranging from Motörhead, Ozzy Osbourne, Kiss to Tenacious D as well as many more.  The main character is also voiced and based on Jack Black which also adds the comical side of things in too.There isn't much difficulty in playing Brutal Legends, as long as you get to grips with the basics of the RTS elements, you won't find yourself having too many issues. The hack and slash parts are too easy at times, so the only challenge comes from the RTS, which is a shame, because I would of liked to have got a little more stuck into the combat and maybe the addition of extra combos.The game length is very respectable, I normally try to complete as many of the side missions I can in these types of games, so it took me almost thirty five hours to complete it fully, so it is a pretty chunky game, time wise.I had a few minor technical issues, even though the game was running at a smooth 60 fps most of the time, it almost felt as if I was still playing at 30, not sure whether that was an issue with my rig or not though, I turned on v-sync and that seemed to make a little better, but not by much. I also wanted to play in windowed mode for a while because I had the wiki page open on my second screen, and this gave me numerous issues with the cursor in game, I would all of a sudden just get my desktop background because my mouse had wandered off screen into my task bar, or I would start to get hover-over tooltips for other shortcuts on my windows task bar randomly, all small issues that could of quite easily of been fixed.My final recommendation for Brutal Legend is definitely give it a try, it might not be everyone's cup of tea, but I did have a lot of fun playing it, I mean, I did plunge thirty five hours of my life playing it...there is plenty of content and even just the sound track is worth some of your time, you can get the game at regular price for £10,99, but expect this to drop to as low as £2 in sales, and then you have yourself a real bargain.If you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

It’s safe to say that I was ecstatic over its well deserved release onto PCs in 2013. It is a game unique in both its hybrid genre and storyline. But that is to be expected from this developer, which gave us many other cult classics. From a graphical point of view, the game has aged very well and it’s still rocking (pun intended) a stellar musical score and general sound effects. It features a vast, beautifully crafted open world in which you may cause mayhem on your own, or in the multiplayer mode included. Having both Trading Cards and Achievements as well as great price tag (even outside seasonal Sales), I really had to focus hard on finding even a single con. The control scheme has been ported well enough to the PC, but a controller would still be preferred to a mouse and keyboard layout. All in all, Brütal Legend is a worthy addition to any gamer’s collection!Strong Points+ Excellent story and setting.+ Pleasant graphics and superb soundtrack.+ Steam Trading Cards & Achievements.Weak Points- Control scheme takes some time getting used to.Rating 10/10This review was submitted forImperial ReviewsandCubbes."

Modern cards cause elements of the game to act quite buggy and no matter what you do you can't seem to make the game perform better, couple that with the game not being terribly clear on what your goal is sometimes and you can get rather frustrated really quick.Id still recommend it but only if you happen to be a big fan of metal."

I bought it on a sale, just because I love metal, and always wanted to try the game. I wish I could have bought it full price. I am really thinking about going somewhere where Tim Schafer is, and handing him 60 dollars. This game was incredible! It is overflowing with charm, it is hilarious, and the work, effort, and vision of the games creators can be tuned into throughout the game. Like playing an Ocarina in Zelda, you play a guitar to summon your ride, fight enemies, and all sorts of great tricks. The soundtrack is hands down the best I've ever heard in a game to a point where you have to admit that it isn't even fair. If you have Motorhead, and Megadeth in your game, you have already won. The playlist feature was also great so I could turn off all the numetal, and anything else that didn't tickle my fancy. The cameos alone are worth the purchase. The combat is fun, although you do feel a bit overpowered through the first part of the game. The reason becomes evident once you pass a couple of chapters, and realize that you are a metal god general. The doubleteam moves are creative, brutal, and funny. I don't think this would play well on a console, or with a controller, but the keyboard and mouse are perfect. I adjusted the controls to make caps lock lock-on, but everything else felt great. Buy this game. It is amazing, and this is the only review I have ever written because I found it so amazing."

,Recommended,225260,7780951,"Posted: 26 November, 2013",all,Emily,"An underrated game when it released on consoles back then - it stars Eddie Rigs (played by Jack Black) , a roadie feeling out of place in the future where modern rock has overtaken classic, after an accident on set, Eddie Rigs is then sent back into the ""Rock Ages"" as a savior of Mankind.The game starts you out in a Cathedral, after Eddie awakens - a robed creature starts chasing you around until you pick up the legendary axe (the weapon you will be using throughout the entire game as your melee/close range) and the game introduces you to what are basic Brawler/Beat-em-Up style controls and also introduces you to your now beefed up Super-Guitar (which servers as your primary projectile weapon). You meet another of the main characters that go by the name of Ophelia, and from there on your fight your way down what appears to be a tower made of skulls until you're able to build a vehicle and escape from that area.Visually, the game looks okay, it has an unique art style to it that I enjoyed seeing and it has really cool looking sights all around the overworld, but ultimately it's a bit repetitive. Some areas just look a little bit too ""samey"" for me, this is somewhat alleviated thanks to the fact that these areas are pretty much modeled after their Area Boss' style of Rock - for example, Lyonwhite (the first major boss) has a more ""glam"" type rock, while the later boss, and major antagonist, Doviculous has a more ""satanic"" design that's modeled after him, which I appreciate. The game also has a pretty colorful cast that's also pretty fun to see as you met them along. The story itself though, is fairly cliche'd, but in a good way I believe, a lot of the things that occur in the game you can pretty much see coming miles away, which is what disappointed me the most about it.The world is pretty expansive, as far as open world games are and there's a multitude of things to do outside the game's story. You can go around destroying Stone Idols (around 100+) that serve as the main collectibles, there are songs around that give you additional buffs after you play them (your guitar can play these songs in a style very similar to that of Zelda OoT's Ocarina) and finding these Garage Doors that serve as your upgrades store (where you meet ""The Rock God"" Ozzy Osbourne there no doubt.). On that store, you can purchase things like upgrades for your moveset, upgrades for your vehicle, skins for your weapons and a bunch more stuff.Outside of the overworld and the basic combat, the game also features a more RTS-like gameplay element to it. On certain major conflicts in the story, the game shifts to an RTS style of game that often serves as the conclusions to the 3 major bosses in the game aswell as the main Multiplayer component to the game - the only difference being that you yourself can drop down in your vehicle or from flight (yes your character gains wings during these events too!) and help out your troops. Sadly though, I felt this was the game's weakest parts personally, mostly because just rushing down your opponents are often the best way to break through the enemy defenses and constantly down their troops close to where they spawn and you yourself taking care of the few that make it through. You spawn more troops as you ""appeal"" to fans (or fan geysers) and gain more points, similar to resources in other RTS games, and are able to build and fix, or summon higher classes of troops to do a variety of things - like healers, heavy hitters, grunts, etc - so the RTS elements here are very bare bones.Ultimately, this felt more like an afterthought to add padding to an already short game. As it stands, this is still one of my favourite games this generation for a good number of reasons, mainly for the music and Jack Black's stellar performance, even though the gameplay is very basic brawler, with added RTS elements to add padding to an already short game.Solid B+"

,Recommended,225260,11630095,"Posted: 10 August, 2014",all,Espresso,"In Sum: Awesome soundtrack and voice performances, mostly fun gameplay with some odd controls and a poorly-realized RTS system tacked on.  The coolness overcomes the flaws mostly. 4.2/5-----Jack Black.  Ozzy Osbourne.  Lemmy.  Rob Halford.  If those names mean anything to you, then you know why you have to play this game.  You'll know what you're in for when you see the opening scene.Brutal Legend is a Heavy Metal fantasy game made by Tim Schafer, creator of classics like Full Throttle and Psychonauts.The game takes place in a fantasy world inspired by metal albums, with many references to metal bands and of course, one of the best soundtracks ever put in a game.  The music alone is like a primer on heavy metal.The story follows a roadie named Eddie Riggs, who is frustrated by the state of modern music.  The band he's touring with sucks and sounds more like a boy band than rockers.  When their stupid antics result in an accident that kills the roadie, he wakes up in a horrific-but-awesome other world, a world where rock and roll has actual power.There is an interesting plot with some fascinating characters along the way.  The game is worth it for the performances.  Jack Black plays Eddie, while his Tenacious D partner Kyle Gass has a small role.  Ozzy, Lita Ford, and Lemmy have important roles, as well, but the biggest performances are provided by Judas Priest's Rob Halford and Tim Curry.  Veteran gaming actress Jennifer Hale also does a great role here.The world never becomes fully realistic due to its fantastical nature, but it never stops being awesome.  This is a game where you can go to a Stonehenge made out of swords, play a guitar riff to summon a Deuce, then drive over to a clone of Mt Rushmore with Ozzy's head while listening to awesome music.The gameplay itself has some issue, and part of the issue is that the game merges several genres, and not all that well.  The camera is unreliable, for one thing.  But the biggest issue is that the game starts out as an action game, then turns into a odd perspective on an RTS.That's right, the game is a real-time strategy except instead of being top down, it's viewed from behind a character.  The game also borrows a bit from Guitar Hero and to a smaller extent, RPGs.  At times, it plays like a GTA-style game.  It is a fusion of many different gaming styles, but they don't really fit together.  The RTS system is especially frustrating.It really is a case of a game's world and immersion compensating for flawed design.  But the greatness of the game in the end makes up for the problems, and it's a great game to play through."

It is classic metal.  Plenty of awesome original stuff, but the landscape is also littered with elements of iconic heavy metal album art.

The story is awesome, the jokes are right on spot. Apart from the regular ""hack'n'slash"" in a quasi-open-world scenario, you'll find yourself busy with guitar-hero-like mechanics, racing, side quests and some other minigames (which unfortunately get old after a short while).The main point of the game seem to be the Stage Battles, which acts like some sort of RTS: you train units (metäääääl), give them orders, send them to destroy the enemy's stage, and of course, you lead the charge. Or you sit there playing your guitar, buffing your units. There are just so many funny things to do in a single Stage Battle, you can hardly get bored, seriously.The achievements are fun and relatively easy (except the Cönquerer).

,Recommended,225260,11979740,"Posted: 4 September, 2014",all,Kralor,"I thought this game looked interesting when it first came out on consoles but, I didn't end up buying it. Then I saw it on sale on steam and I figured I would give it a try. I am not a huge metal fan. Before I played this game I was into some metal but, I never really heard of a lot of these classic metal bands. This game changed all of that, as soon as I began playing I got into the metal theme and music. The game is about a roadie named  Eddie Riggs (Jack Black) who is transported to a metal themed world after a terrible accident at a concert. This game features a Stellar sound track and cast, as well as a unique concept. The game play is a mix between some basic hack n slash, drive/shoot mechanics and some RTS elements. I am one of the people that didn't enjoy the RTS elements of the game, wich require you to play guitar solos to build fan booths on predetermined points used to spawn allies. You also get demon wings during these sections that allow you to move across the battlefield and command your army. The first time was fun but, after that it became tedious and somewhat frustrating. Though I do appreciate the unique use of RTS elements. However, this didn't stop me from enjoying the rest of the game because I liked the other elements of the game enough to force myself to get through the RTS sections. All in all I enjoyed the game and I couldn't be happier with my purchase if only to introduce me to some kick a$$ metal that I had missed out on for the first 21 years of my life. If you appreciate unique ideas, good music, good humor, and a strong cast, then I would recommend this game. If you have doubts then wait until it's on sell, at that point you can't go wrong.  \m/ Rock on!"

You can use your axe to slash and smash and behead and rip your enemies apart, or you can use your guitar to burn and electrify them by playing music, or cast some spells by playing specific ""musical spells"" and summon buffs for you allies, curses for the enemy, special attacks (inclusing a huge falling zeppelin on fire - hard to miss the point if you are into this kind of music) and also used to summon animals to aid you or ride later on and a very cool hot rod car that you can modify.Defo recommended.This game is dope."

And we all know that that means...There are three qualities to this game that make it worthy of the hype it has gotten. For Simplicity's sake, I'll label them.It's true to the source material.This is suprising since the source material is just Metal. Metal songs, and metal cover art, and that's it. Now drive around the land that the game takes place in, and tell me that you can't take a screenshot of ANY LANDMARK, slap a random cover title on it, and tell someone that it's a real CD cover. This is quite spectacular, but it's nothing for Double Fine. They seem to specialize in surreal locations that others couldn't imagine existing. They made Psychonauts, after all. They also use metal instruments for all background songs. ALL OF THEM. (Sadly, you won't hear it that often because you're too busy listening to the 107+ metal songs on the radio in your car) If you are a hardcore Metal fan, you won't be disappointed.Characters applenty.As a Double Fine game, it makes sense that every character has lines for any situation that they can get into in game. Your allies sees Eddie play a song? Compliments come in. They see Eddie take off? They can say that your wings look cool, or tell you not to leave them, depending on the circumstances. Also, the commentary is hilarious. The guy that takes the case though, is Eddie Riggs, the main character, who is voiced by Jack Black (the voice behind Po in Kung Fu Panda, among others). He takes the cake by staying true to the character of a Metal Roadie thrusted into the world of Brutal Legends, all the while showing off his incredible comedy skills.Real Time Strategy goes fast paced.Now, when have you heard strategy and intense being used together. At all? It's incredibly rare, and hard to pull off, but Brutal Legends did it. They made a Strategy game that's more than amassing troops and sending them at the enemy base before they reach yours (Although that still works). With nuke solos, powerful double teams, and various other nasty tricks to pull, the RTS element of the game, the Multiplayer Stage Battles, is incredible, capable of turning the tables with the right move, and mixing hack and slash into there so you can join the fun of killing your enemy's troops over and over again! And with three different factions, each with their own playstyle and strategies to pull off, you can enjoy it again and again.If you kile RTS games, Metal, or the works of Double Fine, this is a game that won't disapoint. If you have an aversion to any of these, then run now, and never come back."

You play as Eddie Riggs, a Roadie who gets killed in an accident on stage, but is transported to a magical world of Heavy Metal. It is a blast to play and the characters and humor are excellent. So is the soundtrack. You unlock over 100 songs and while I’m not a metalhead, I thought the music was one of the best things about the game. I’m thinking of picking up a few CD from the best bands included here, especially Angel Witch.Apparently Double Fine is thinking about a sequel to this game. I will have to crowdfund that one."

That's right... it even has RTS game-play that was modeled after the amazing Sega Genesis classic Herzog Zwei.  There is quite a bit of depth to the RTS with lots of different unit types and the ability to control where each group of units go on the battlefield.  Some of the RTS battles were very difficult and I had to replay them a couple of times, and each time could be a half hour or more.  I changed the difficulty level to “gentle” so I could get past some of them.  In addition to the RTS battles, there are missions to rescue people, escort the tour bus, and racing sequences.  There are also lots of side missions.  The story is fairly complex and interesting and is told with a lot of humor.  If you like Heavy Metal music it has a great soundtrack and cameo appearances from several famous band members.  Overall it is a fun and unique experience that should not be missed."

As a fan of heavy metal, I'm gonna say it's almost a masterpiece. I got it on sale during the Steam Winter Sales 2016, and I probably wouldn't have bought it for the full price. I thought, wait, is that Jack Black, Lemmy and Ozzy I hear, while watching a trailer, and thought ""f**k it, I'm gonna buy it. I'll just write a short resumé that doesn't really spoil anything:ResuméYou start off as a Roadie named Eddie (voiced by Tenacious D lead singer Jack Black), at a gig. A member of the band has climbed up high on the stage, and is now falling down. Eddie manages to save the bandmember, but is crushed by some falling scenery. His blood lands on his belt buckle, in reality an amulet for Ormagöden. The monster Ormagöden then comes to life, and kills the band, and then takes Eddie to a magical world, in which a guitar not only makes sounds, but also blows things up. Eddie wakes up at what looks like a satanic summoning ritual (no surprise, it's a heavy metal game), and will soon have to fight the monsters dressed as monks. He meets a woman named Ophelia (voiced by Jennifer Hale, known for multiple hit video games and TV series, such as WoW, Mass Effect 3, and multiple Star Wars series and games). Together they go and meet a guy named Lars (voiced by Zach Hanks, also vid game voice actor), and together they decide to free the magical world from the tyranny of the evil Lionwhyte (voiced by Rob Halford). Eddie starts off by freeing a bunch the ""Headbangers"" (get the reference??) from a mine. During the adventures, Eddie meets many different characters voiced by famous heavy metal starts, including:Notable VoiceactorsLemmy Killmister (legendary heavy metal star, founder of Motörhead), voicing the Killmaster.Ozzy Ousbourne (also a legend, from Black Sabbath), voicing The Guardian of Metal.Kyle Gass (deserves to be a legend, from Tenacious D), voicing Kage the Kannonier.Jack Black (just ONE step closer to being a legend than Kage, from Tenacious D), voicing Eddie Riggs.Buy it on sale, unless you are a really hardcore metal fan, then just get it as fast as possible, you're missing out on something golden"

For the RTS part you do stage battles where you build towers that make energy for your troop production, there are about 4 factions and each have their own unique play style with their own cool units. You also can use solos to summon more troops, build towers, move troops, use special powers and even buff or debuff others.

For starters, Brutal Legend is a game that has to be experienced. It's an open world action adventure with a few RTS elements added to it (more on that in a bit).Think of any open world game, add a heavy metal flavour to this world, throw some heavy metal music in there as well and voila, you pretty much have Brutal Legend.It's charming, looks great and above all, it's fun. Except for one thing... Which brings me back to the RTS part. There are a few missions where you have to build an army and engage your enemies in combat, RTS style. And even though it works - it's perfectly playable - it just... It just isn't any fun. It's more of a chore when I think about it. This part is the only negative thing I can think of.But, don't let that keep you from buying it. Brutal Legend, like most of the Double Fine games, is one brilliant game.

,Recommended,225260,33041161,Posted: 30 June,all,EazyCheeze1978,"(Originally written 10/13/2009)Jack Black is one of the most entertaining and unique actors on the Hollywood scene today; he started work in the comedic band he founded alongside Kyle Gass known as Tenacious D, and his career only went up from there. This is his first videogame, and if it's any indication, he will be in high demand in the field of voice acting for many years to come.The story of this game is a rather unique one: Eddie Riggs (voiced by Black) is the world's best roadie, best at not being seen doing what needs to be done behind the scenes. One day while preparing the stage for an extremely weak hair metal band to which he is attached, something... interesting happens, and his blood somehow gets on to an enchanted belt buckle; what follows is an extremely surrealistic experience, in which Eddie is transported to a sort of alternate universe based largely around heavy metal and the battle between it and hair metal.Through a combination of his axe which he finds early on, the Separator, and his ""axe,"" his guitar named Clementine, Eddie cuts a swath through his enemies, and electrocutes or immolates them due to the added magical power this new realm gives his guitar. He'll need these abilities, as well as help from several supporting characters, such as the Forge Master (played by Ozzie Osbourne), to upgrade his attacks, his weapons and his hot rod, the Deuce, and the Kill Master (played by Lemmy from Motorhead, whose last name is Kilmister), to heal his allies in combat.Along with the action, there is a real-time-strategy element, in which you can command your units to attack or defend various targets in the completion of your missions. You may also go down into combat during these sequences, as well as take them on in multiplayer with or against several other people at once.With the good must come the bad; but thankfully, Brutal Legend doesn't have much of that. Sometimes it's difficult to micromanage various tasks as is often the case in Real-time-strategy games, but it's not too big a deal. Also, poor Eddie can't jump! This is pretty much a glaring omission, but it's not game-breaking in the least.The visual style of the game is based on classic heavy metal album covers, complete with grand, metallic monsters and epic, wide landscapes. The modeling of Eddie Riggs to look like Jack Black is accurate if slightly caricatured, as is that of most other characters I've seen. The soundtrack is filled with classic metal tunes, and the voice acting is some of the best I've heard in games recently.I strongly urge you to go pick this up if you haven't already; if you're a big fan of heavy metal music, or of games in general, you will not regret it! A solid five stars!"

So many celebrities can be named in the game, Ozzie Osbourne or Kyle Gus are just a few of them, but the list can go on, I highly doubt I will be able to enumerate even half of the good aspects the game has in one quick review.The OST is flawless, with over 100 tracks, the soundtrack is one of the strongest points of the game.The second best point can only be the graphics, which offer divine views, panoramas and ambiances (combined with the soundtrack is just heaven, you could just randomly roam around listening and vieweing for hours), not to mention that the characters are quite well done as well.A good storyline, with lots of twists and teachings, humor and drama, mainly focusing on the rock culture, great concepts, filled with ideas, mainly parodies you could say, of combinations between mytical creatures/objects and rock related elements.The gameplay is quite nice, combining Hack and Slash with RTS in an interesting way, quite unique in my opinion, but it can become difficult on the hardest settings if you haven't mastered the RTS spirit, not to mention against real players.The limitation of the world are one of the negative aspects, it's true you can roam free as much as you want, but you can easily get stuck on hills or branches, because most of the world is stuck itself, not dynamic. Anyways, climbing certain hills or going through certain (original) shortcuts can be impossible and result with you hovering in mid-air without any other way out than restarting from a checkpoint, so in conclusion you do not have freedom of going too sandboxish in the game, due to the many invisible walls.Multiplayer...*sigh*...I can't really say much about it, I am probably not dedicated to it, either not skilled or maybe the matchmaking is faulty, but the few games I played, every time I was finished in a matter of minutes...but I can oversee that, since I played it only for the singleplayer, can't foresee too much fun in a multiplayer game, but in a co-op (if they would have implement such a thing) would have been warmly welcomed.In conclusion, I highly recommend the game because it simply rocks!"

Yes, it is a proper game with a intricate gameplay of many interwoven genres, with switch changes from third person slasher through arcade race to tactical battle for tower dominance. Still, the main part of the game is kitsсh and forgotten childish dream about coolness. It visualise glory and vivid brutality of the golden age of hard rock, binding together all archetypal memes of the time. And it is glazed with nostalgy about  good old times, with a bit of self-irony - for forty year old boys, who just remembered the youth.Story is bloody, setting is epic, heroes are brutal and girls are hot. To make it more spicy for oldies, it glimmering with few noir-ish strokes of bitterness of burn-out mid-age man, who sees time passing and new generation replacing his achievements with own new ideas he rejects.Nevertheless, the main theme is a fun and child dreams about something cool to rapture.You want to see mountains made of giant blades piercing clouds? You have it! You want to see how sound of burning electric guitar trembling the earth and knocking out the foes? You got it! How about Big Metallic Spiders spewing web of hand-thick steel wires? Or giant dam maid of subwoofers capable to scatter rocks? Or hellish creatures raised by your guitar solo? Enemy crowd turning to your side by crazy cool rock music you play to lead them? Yes, yes, and you can ask for extra.Brutal Legend keeps high standards of Double Fine games - rich and expressive grotesque heroes, original and amusing  visual metaphors, perfectly suited voice actors together with a tiny bit of social satire, sufficient to cause snicker but not enough to become gloomy serious."

Black's dialogue and delivery is priceless as is the fantastic writing by Mr. Schafer himself. The PC version is more than 'just a port', looking and moving far superior to the console editions. The controls are fantastic, specifically with a gamepad. The only issue I have with the game, really, is that combat can be far too simplistic and frantic to be as fun as one might imagine it would be. Also, once the game introduces RTS elements in the form of squads and minions, it goes from 'true metal' to 'nu-metal' in terms enjoyment. That being said, there is a great story here with an enjoyable cast of characters and satirical achetypes. The game overall is great fun, and exploration and a joy.

To say my expectations were low isn't an understatement.  However, I found an incredibly fun action game, with a well told story.  The voice acting was exceptional all the way around, and the music is a solid sample from all over the genre.  The game took all of the outrageous sillyness in the basic concept is stride and embraced it in a way that had me smiling at the jokes rather than groaning.I lost a weekend to this game and enjoyed every minute of it.  It's a bit easy compared to other action titles, but the story is good enough that it doesn't matter.  This game is one of those that I wouldn't have been upset to pay full price for, so the current price is completely worth it.  If you have even the slightest interest, don't pass this up!"

76561198053557027,Recommended,225260,9902071,"Posted: 22 April, 2014",all,pillowpride,"Very underrated game imho.The story is very fun and entertaining in my opinion, even if you are not a Heavy Metal Fan (but it helps being one). I think the writers did a good job of combining a great string of original ideas with classic heavy metal lore. Only downside is that the main story is a bit short for my taste (i must confess, i could not get enough of it), linear and the climax was a bit disappointing. They clearly tried too hard to set the story up for a sequel, which probably will never be developed.The gameplay itself is fun, although a slightly repetitive. You basically have 3 kinds of missions: Hack'n'Slay-style main missions, exciting driving missions and the battlefield missions which were a great new idea, but didn't fulfill their potential despite being fun aswell. The optional side missions lack variety and proper incentive (besides some points to buy power-ups and clothes / car kits your really get nothing from them)... they could have done a better job including side missions into the story, like getting 4-5 minor storylines into the game. As I said, it's very linear. Some people may consider it a weak spot, but i think it's cool that you can choose to simply beat the bejeezus out of everyone with the standard moves or get and use all special moves to maximize your efficiency. I personally found the specials generally useless and there was no tactical aspect to the game... it's more of an arcade-style gameplay. Controls are ok on PC, but you clearly notice this game was made primarily for consoles and ""dumbed down"" for a broader audience. Too bad they failed at promoting it accordingly.Graphics are appropriate for their time and serve their purpose. Don't expect any fireworks... this game is about fun and originality, not cutting edge technology. The Soundtrack is absolutely fantastic and really helps you immerse into the game world. Voice acting is also tremendous with tons of cool guest appearances (i.e. Kyle Gass of Tenacious D and Lemmy from Motörhead). Level design is absolutely off the hook although you can beat the game by essentially giving your enemies the Diablo 2-barbarian-treatment  all the time (charge head-on - kill everything in sight with brute force - move on).Bottom line: This game is a one-trick-pony, but that one trick is really really awesome. It's not worth a release-date pricetag, but a solid and fun game. If you want about 20-30 hours of straightforward fun and a short, yet entertaining story to fill some ""time off"" from the games you usually play, you'll have a good time with BL. If you are someone that prefers showing off his/her skills, looting/practicing for multiplayer games or spend hours getting every achievement, i recommend sticking to some MMORPG or FPS."

I heard a lot of things before this came out, and I heard even more after it was released. As a metal fan, I had to own this game someday.Unfortunately it was only till a couple of weeks ago that I was first able to play it. I knew this was a game to enjoy because of the cameo's and references, and because I didn't expect any news-breaking gameplay I wasn't in a rush to get it.I must tell you: I was NOT dissapointed.First of all, when you buy this as an appreciator of either old classic rock (Menowar, Judast Priest, Black Sabbath, etc.) or just plain metal (Megadeth, 3 Inches of Blood, Children of Bodom and almost too many more) you will enjoy it. When I saw Ozzy Osbourne almost my whole life flashed by because of his pure awesomeness. And of course Rob Halford as Lionwhite, Lemmy as The Kill Master and more. But even smaller cameo's like Tim Curry (Rocky Horror Show), Metalocalypse-writer and actor Brian Posehn and Jack Black's sidekick Kile Gas.And last but not least; Jack Black... In real life almost such a hero as in Brutal Legend (except saving the earth as a Roady by preforming awesome solo's and creating whole stages and merchandise booths by pure awesomeness).Second comes gameplay. Yes, un purpose. Because if you are more interested in the works of Tim schafer and Double Fine you will find this game probably dissapointing (unless you are actually interested in the 'fun themes' of Double Fine). Yes, the humor does return in this game, even in a large amount! But gameplay wise this is certainly not news-breaking (as my suspicion already indicated).However, even though the game failed to be a good sandbox/rpg game, it did succeed in being unique and diverse. There are a lot of minor quests that are fun, unique and awesome to play when you lost interest in the main quest (which is nothing special, I should mension. Just fun, nothing special..).A last, third thing I should mention is the driving mechanism. I liked this game a lot, mainly because it was good in being mediocore and awesome, but driving in this game is almost impossible. You quickly lose control of your vehicle, it will change direction after the slightest bump in the road, and it can bring you on surfaces you can't walk away from (which makes you restart the game from last checkpoint).I recommend this game, once again, for being an Awesome, Fun and Brutal piece of mediocore game; ups and downs when it comes to gameplay, but the best when it comes to humor and appearances!"

The soundtrack is absolutely superb and so is the voice-acting. The graphics are not state-of-the-art anymore, but this hardly matters since this game is all about chrome and metal anyway. So as long as the bump-mapping is okay: you are cool. Also I truly believe hair-animation was originally invented by some dude that played Brütal and it's only purpose was to allow more realistic head-banging.The game itself hardly sticks with any genre. It takes whatever floats the boat and is the most fun. Meaning it is a road-racing, story-driven, strategic, exploration, adventure, 3rd-person fighting game with RPG elements and Ozzy Osbourne. Also you cast magic spells using an interface that basically looks like Guitar hero.Personally I'm not a big Metal fan. So I may be missing a few puns, but since the focus is on more classic material (even though Metal never gets ""classic"" it simply becomes more ""epic"") even an ""outsider"" like me can enjoy it very much and will recognize many of the characters.The game may be less fun for kids that have not been around in the 19XXies, folks that are dead-serious about their Metal, and people having a favorite activity in bird-watching.

,Recommended,225260,23969867,"Posted: 30 June, 2016",all,FunkBlaster,"TL;DR – Great world and soundtrack, average gameplay and story. It's easy to look past the game’s issues and still have a good time.Like most Tim Schaefer games, Brutal Legend is unique. It is completely focused on heavy metal and the subculture that accompanies the game. What amazes me is that the team at Double Fine created this game as a love letter to a genre that is rather obscure (to some), while also allowing outsiders to easily be drawn in and understand what is happening.I’m not a metalhead. My taste in music leans more towards punk and hardcore. All I knew about metal before going in was the generic stuff that pretty much everyone else knows already. As somewhat of an outsider, I was immediately drawn in to the world and was able to understand with relative ease what the game was doing and referring to. The game brings you in to this world where the heavy metal subculture reigns supreme, and the player is able to instantly feel at home, even if he is familiar with it.Another facet of the game that I loved was the game’s treatment of the game’s protagonist, Eddie (voiced by the amazing Jack Black, who is a perfect fit for this role), and how he is a roadie. Eddie is able to shred balls on a guitar and build a stage out of anything, but knows that his job is not out on the frontlines. He is always willing to stand back in the shadows and work as someone else gets the glory. It shows an understanding on Double Fine’s part of how bands work. All of the references Double Fine makes to the band culture and heavy metal never feel forced. They get all of these little bits just right. The player is able to tell that the developers understand heavy metal, but do not try to force it. This is the game’s greatest strength, in my opinion, and something that is extremely difficult to pull off effectively. The game is enjoyable from start to finish because the player never rolls his eyes and thinks “you’re trying too hard.”With all of this in mind, it better have a soundtrack that is able to back everything else up. Thankfully, it does. Double Fine has amassed a collection of songs from well-known metal bands such as Judas Priest, Motorhead, and Black Sabbath mixed with songs from smaller, independent metal bands. The soundtrack always has something awesome pumping into your ears as you slay demons. Have you ever fought a final boss as Judas Priest blasts through your speakers? It just feels… right. As I mentioned before, I am not a metalhead by any stretch of the word, but this game got me to check out some of the bands on the soundtrack and I actually really like them (Brocas Helm, Iced Earth and In Flames being a few of my favorites). Now I wish more games had metal soundtracks because of how well the music compliments everything that happens in-game. My only complaint (and this is fairly minor) is that the song changes every time you do something in the game world (find certain collectables, die, get too far away from your car etc). I almost never heard a song all the way through.***It is important to note, however, that if you are one of those people who recoil at the sound of metal and have some kind of argument along the lines of “it’s screamo!” or “it’s just a bunch of noise with some guy yelling” then this game is clearly NOT for you. Before you go into this game, you must at least have an open mind about metal.Ok, all of that is well and good, but how does is play? Well, the answer is…average. The combat works, but it’s not super entertaining. It doesn’t flow very well. There are different moves you can do by inputting different button combinations, but they don’t lead into each other. I would have preferred a system similar to the Batman Arkham series. At least in those titles, the combat flows seamlessly and you can bounce between multiple enemies with ease. Brutal Legend requires you to focus on one enemy at a time, but oftentimes throws 4 or 5 at you at once. This can be frustrating, as you cannot do anything to attack any of the other enemies if they swarm you.Another huge part of this game is the driving, which I felt was a bit clunky. It felt like a minigame that was added in as a fun thing to do on the side, not a key part of the gameplay. The control was not as tight as it should have been, and it can be difficult to line your car up for a jump if you are not given a small runway leading up to it.The game’s story is also nothing special. It does make an effort to draw you in and invest you emotionally in the story with the death and/or betrayal of a few key characters, but it never quite worked for me. I never got super attached to those characters to begin with. When the game begins, Eddie is transported to this new world and immediately the “good guys” take a liking to him. There is no development of his friendship with these characters, and I did not feel any connection with them as a result.When reading other critics reviews of this game, you will almost inevitably see mention of the real time strategy elements in this game. At first, I didn’t mind them because they were kind of fun. This all changed once I reached the final 2 missions, however. There is a sudden difficulty spike at the end that blindsided me. To my eternal shame, I had to look up a guide online on how to beat the penultimate mission. The battles until that point are relatively easy, but those final two missions completely changed how I felt about it. The game probably would have been better off without it, anyway. It doesn’t really fit in with the theme. The RTS elements aren’t introduced until midway through the game, and the sudden shift makes no sense when the game has been a brawler the whole time. Furthermore, you have this badass axe and guitar on your back that deal damage to enemies. I wanted to be in the fight slaying my enemies with the powers of rock, not directing the battle and ordering units around.Overall, this game has tons of charm and can win you over fairly easily. It’s dedicated to something that very few other games have touched on, and none in a manner so focused like this. With all of that in mind, it becomes very easy to look past some of the game’s more minor flaws and still have a great time with this game.4/5"

The first of the games two major draws is the amazing world Tim Schafer and co. created. You can screenshot the game at almost any moment and there will be something amazing on screen. The art design for the game is breathtaking esspecially for fans of heavy metal like myself. It's a world made from the stuff of album covers and it's well worth visiting.The other major draw is the soundtrack. I remember when the game was being promoted they had a video of Tim Schafer solving a rubix cube before they could list all the names of the bands represented. To make things even sweet some of the members of those bands are in the voice cast for this game. Ozzy is particular has a wonderful role here. The songs are used throughout the game both while exploring the overworld through your car radio and to set the mood for missions in the game. I cant think of a single instance where a song felt out of place. In fact sometimes the music felt so right I couldnt help but grin from ear to ear.

What were they thinking?Brutal Legend looks like a cartoonish God of War game set in a land designed to look like a metal album cover, and it plays like a poor man's God of War for a few minutes before adding in a car for you to drive, giving you the impression that the driving might be the core mechanic to the game. While both of these aspects are important, it is not until a few hours into the game (if you're exploring things thoroughly and taking your time), that you realize that one of the biggest gameplay elements is real time strategy...you know, like Starcraft of Command & Conquer Red Alert. You go up into the sky, look down, command and spawn new troops, using very rudimentary commands to send them to certain points on the battlefield.Needless to say, the beast was stunned. I found myself blinking in confusion when the moment hit that I realized that this was largely an RTS game, and my shock led to me getting my rear end handed to me time and again when I played on the PS3. Years later, I got it super cheap on PC and decided to brave it again, knowing what I was getting into. Thsi time, I didn't let shock get the better of me, and I paid more attention to the rock-paper-scissors sort of system that was going on with the different units (some units were better against others, etc. (duh)), and got through the game.It's a silly story set in a fun world that makes a huge deal about music, and Jack Black enthusiastically (of course) voices the lead character who is basically a more-muscled Jack Black. Although my first time playing the game I quit after the sudden shock and dissatisfaction with the RTS elements I never expected or wanted in the game, my second attempt was far more fruitful, and I did have a good time, completing the game and remembering it pretty fondly looking back on it."

Made by talented and imaginative people from Double Fine, Brutal Legend tells two stories: A story about the adventures of a roadie called Riggs in the wild, dangerous and breathtaking land of Ormagöden. It is also a tribute to the glory of Metal as well as being alone on the unknown road, heading to the unperceivable fate.The story is near perfect, with varied main missions that don’t get boring, as you drive, hack and command your troops to victory with many music legends that have voiced the memorable characters that you meet on this unforgettable ride. There’s chase, fury, standoff against insurmountable odds, there’s laughter, sadness, love, betrayal and payback time. The graphics are still standing well, with the land of Ormagöden that remains one of the very best fantasy settings ever created; its landmarks and the trip through it will take your breath away on a regular basis.And then there’s the Deuce, the most important character in the game, the one that you’ll spend most of the time hanging out with, a hell-bent and timid car that you’ll drive and try to subdue all the time with its touchy and sensitive response. It can be and will have to be upgraded and molded into the death dealing machine if you intend to survive. You also have a trusty axe and a set of flashy moves that you’ll learn to implement on the skulls of your enemies, God of War-like style. If that’s not enough, there is a full-on, fast and furious RTS as well, where you’ll control your troops and resources as you try to take down the enemy stage. Loyal headbangers are your army, fans are your resources, and your music stage is the center of power. There’s even some meta-jab at the necessity and the power of merchandising that did not go unnoticed. There’s multiplayer that is still active with frenetic and quick battles, if you want more Brutal Legend after you are done with the single player experience.It all sounds well and majestic, and for the most part Brutal Legend truly delivers. But there are some problems under the hood: vehicle and fighting controls are very touchy and best suited for an analogue controller, side-missions do become a busy chore after a while, and the real time strategy bit is good but not great due to overall complexity and a mix of game genres. I have to mention that Giants: Citizen Kabuto did strategy-action-drive mix much better. You’ll do just fine with a mouse and a keyboard, but there will always be that nagging feel at the back of your skull that you’re somehow being tied down.Brutal Legend is not perfect; it has an attitude and a greater that life character. But man, what a ride this game is… It’ll slap a wide smile over your face that won’t come off until you are done playing. Get it, feel it, love it :D"

I was wrong.In many ways this game is a combination of the standard open world games of today, mixed with rediculous awesomeness that games of the past once had. Theres rarely ever punishment and the player reward/ new power moments seem to happen every couple minutes. Whether your leaning a new solo, or hitting a sweet ramp with your customizable kill car, or unlocking a new song to play on your radio; theres almost always something awesome happening. Oh and its arguable if not likely that this game has the greatest soundtrack in the history of video games.I bought this game in 2017 and played it with an i5 and gtx 1050. It ran smooth and easy on 1080p. Not as pretty as modern games, but still manages to pull off some scenery moments that really suck you into the world. Really the only down side is now I think Jack Black is cool.Many times, the gaming developing teams will let us down for one reason or another. But in the case of Brutal Legend I feel the gaming consumer market dropped the ball. Maybe it was marketing, who knows? What matters is that this is the hack n slash, drive around in your car, gunning down hell horses, while blasting ANVIL, game we always wanted.This is the best game you never played."

The audio is a bit strange, where the awesome music in the background will be nearly muted when characters are speaking but it comes back between lines of dialogue, creating a wavy volume control.In conclusion, they could have done  better job mixing the audio, but the fun is still there, with a lot of recognizable faces and voices."

From Jack Black being the main character, to Ozzy Osbourne as the shopkeeper and god of metal. This game uses as many iconic things that makes up metal and its culture. The game has 3 main gameplay mechanics, its a beat em up with heavily used driving mechanics and strategy game mechanics mashed together. If strategy games like Comand and Conqure isn't your thing then don't worry, its not filled with it and its more action oriented than those counterparts. The only main complaint is the game's length, it shouldn't take much time at all if you really wanna try a speed run of it, so if you're looking for a long and joyful distraction, Burtal Legend is FUN and a great time, but it won't be able to go for long especially if you care for only the main story. Other than that this is a great hack and slash, open world game with a huge love for metal, with a soundtrack of artists like Ozzy, Black Sabbath, Motorhead, Megadeth, Diamond Head, and so forth; this game is even better when you're a metal head!8/10 - If longer I would whole heartedly give it a 10/10!

Shout orders at your troops, inspire, and personally deliver a beating onto your enemies. Brutal Legend's core gameplay is this combination of RTS and 3rd person action, an innovative approach on its own, and yet it offers so much more on top.Let's talk about the good. Tim Shaffer is like the Tim Burton of gaming. His game worlds are utterly unique and stylish. The world is based on Heavy Metal. For someone who's never been into metal, I was dumbfounded by the world building. I can only image the exultation this game would bring to Metal fans. Whatever it is you're doing, you're never far off from the music. In this world, music is your weapon. I felt at times like the guitarist in Mad Max: Fury Road, who uses rock as the armies' battlecry, that alone is worth the price of admission. This is a game that must be experienced.There are two types of must-play games, games that are so creative it is unlike anything else, and games that perfect a genre. Brutal Legend is the former of the two. One issue holds it back: the unlock requirement does not fit its length. You can easily beat the game (~8 hours) without unlocking half of your abilities. It would be better to give the player everything from the start, so that we can try out all the gears and master the fighting system before the game ends. As a result, combat is stunted. If you want the best 3rd person action gameplay, look to God of War or Bayonetta. Play Brutal Legend for every other reason.9.5/10"

Brutal Legend is the very reason why I'm into the music I'm into today; which is of course, Metal! All kinds, but I'm a big fan of Black/Death metal. This game has a heavy emphasis on metal music, with the entire game basically being one big metal album, with a collection of metal songs as well as clever references to other metal bands/songs.One thing that may surprise you is that this is *kind of* an RTS game. About 35%-40% of the way through, you have your first stage battle of the game (of which there are only 5 in single player). The RTS elements were never included in a demo before release because the release of this game got rushed, which is why I think people are a little harsh with this game. People just weren't prepared for RTS :PAbsolutely worth the $15 if you like RTS games, hack 'n' slash games, or if you want to get into metal music! Especially the last one :P9/10"

For real. I love this game.Brutal Legend is a fun, metal, gore ridden game. It's a mix between slasher combat and RTS style gameplay. The story missions, are worth the price alone. It is about Eddie Riggs, a roadie for the worst metal band of all time, who supposedly dies and reawakens in a world created by the gods of F**KING METAL. You are thrown straight in to the to world upon a hill of bones. You explore and build a car, and then explore more but only with F**CKING METAL tunes. You slay demons, and fight for humanity as they have been overthrown by an evil demon empire who you must overcome using the power of F**KING METAL. Honestly, Jack Black is the best he's ever been in this game in terms of any sort of acting, and I love it. His humor, and character fits Eddie Riggs like how butter flows on bread. The RTS style gameplay is fun, too. Not cvery tactical, but fun. In the multiplay you can pick between three factions and then raise an army, creating them using the currency of 'fans' which yo earn by creating towers from gysers spread across the map. Some you'll find yourself fighting for a lot. Then you must upgrade to stronger units and order them into battle to destory the enemy stage (BASE). I'm so glad this game HAS a multiplayer, but like I said, you should buy this for the campaign alone. You will not regret it. ESPECIALLY if you're a metal fan. THIS GAME HAS OZZY F**CKING OZBOURNE, MAN!"
76561198070445242,Recommended,225260,32867424,Posted: 27 June,all,Neverdusk,"I played this when it first came out, and it reinvisioned my music playlist.So I decided to get it again on sale, because why not, and realized how great and how much this game actually is. It's certainly not for everybody, but you definitely do not need to be into hard metal to like it, as long as you don't dislike it. It does have it's flaws (samey side quests, a simple story, basic combat), but it is above all else fun.The game offers two types of combat - normal hack-and-slash and tower defence battles. The first is action-packed, the second adds a layer of strategy. But they go well surprisingly well, and the second mode is never boring so long as you know what you're doing. You'll find yourself ripping out gutiar solos on the battlefield one moment and organizing waves of headbangers the next moment.As for sound and music, this game has one of the best soundtracks I've ever heard in a video game. Dozens upon dozens of songs ranging from soft rock, hard metal, and even hair bands. And it nods to all of them, with characters that humorously reflect the different genreslike a man who flies with his hair and an army of goths. The variety is surprising, and I've fallen in love with a lot of songs and styles I would have never discovered otherwise. Speaking of sound - Jack Black's voice acting is hilarious and adds tremendously to the game's great dialogue.Honestly, it hasn't aged too badly either. I was wary about playing it again 8 years after it came out, but I found myself having an absolute ball. Double Fine's style never ceases to amaze me. If you enjoy Double Fine games or have even the slightest interest in rock, I'd highly recommend this game."

It got much better 25% in when you got use to the controls and the feel of the game. It is open world so expect to go to run here and have to run back so forth and so on. But in the end it was very good game and I'm glad I played it.

From one moment you are driving around an open world fantasy map going from quest hub to quest hub (or trying to get that one collectable), to playing a standard solo action game, to playing some weird RTS game where you command an army while also playing a unit yourself. Its kind of confused on what it wants to do and this both helps and hurts the overall quality of the game. Because it trys to keep everything in the same control structure (you controlling the Eddy Riggs) and simply giving you a few more commands (which fit into a game controller nicely, you never feel truely overwhelmed by the options.The soundtrack and universe are where this game really shines though. Seriously they brought in Rock & Metal Legends to do voice acting on main characters, and you can tell they are enjoying their parts. Combine that with the fact the whole universe is designed to be the cover art of a Heavy Metal Album you always feel awesome just doing more mundane things.The story is simple and is mostly there to keep the player active. Nothing fancy but it doesn't need to be, as I said you feel awesome doing things that other games might make you feel bored doing. And as they trickle in new mechanics through out the game you don't get tired of doing the same thing over and over.Overall a solid buy, though I would recommend a controller as it was obviously ported to PC and built with one in mind."
,Recommended,225260,33853982,Posted: 28 July,all,Chrionz,"Picked up this game on sale for under $10. I remember playing it on Xbox 360, but could never get past thefight in the dry ice mines with Ophilia where Cradle Of Filth plays.What I did remember was how insanely fun and funny this game is. Jack Black's style of humor is front and center in this game. You have cameos fromOzzy Osbourne, Lemmy Kilmister, Lita Ford, Rob Halford, and even Tim Curry!The soundtrack is amazing. While the original soundtrack is brutal as hell, the actual metal songs included in the in-game radio are great and actually well diversed. Motley Crue, Megadeth, Judas Priest, Cradle of Filth, King Diamond, and many more are all in the in-game radio and played on missions.The gameplay is hack and slash as well as some driving sections. It does experiment by including ""stage battles"" which are sort of RTS games where you build up your troops and use fans for resources. It excutes this amazingly in my opinion. You're not just this guy in the sky controlling things, you can fight along-side them. I have not tried the multiplayer, however they are just the stage battles against other people.Technical wise, the game is sound. I had not had one crash while playing through it. The v-sync does stutter a bit, and I would have liked some other AA options other than SSMA. Even so, with an i7 6700k and a gtx 1070, I ran above 60fps at all times, while maxed out with SSMA x4. The graphics are dated, however I enjoy the style of it.Overall, if you love heavy metal and hack and slash games, I strongly suggest this game. Everything it tries, it succeeds at, and not many games can say that. Well worth the $20 at normal price, and even more worth it to catch it on sale."

If you like tough combat and challenges, I would recommend with caution, as I found the game to be quite easy on the hardest difficulty. I played and completed the game on my Xbox, but liked it so much I bought it here on Steam again.I am not really a fan of metal, though this game surely did expose me to some awesome songs I never new it existed. The ""lore of metal"" is actually quite well conceived and feels like creatures, fortresses and environment came strait from a metal disc cover.  The world is very different to the usual, I dare say unique. There is nothing quite like it.I did not find the game to be hard, but it sure is relaxing causing all that mayhem while exploring the world of metal, especially listening to those songs (wow, again, I knew nothing of them). Combat is pretty much hack and slash with driving around while running over stuff for good measure. There are occasional ""strategic"" battles which you have to command an army while in 3rd person, I guess this is where the game becomes a love it or hate it point.While the game does provide enough closure, I do wish a sequel could be made one day. I kinda wanted more out of this place by the end, its really cool."

It is an old game but it wasn't shy to be its own beast and be in your face throughout the whole game. If you enjoy old school metal and rock, even Tenacious D, you'll enjoy the tiny details within the game that make it that much more special. You'll get sucked in with the atmosphere even if the controls are a little clunky. The story is amazing and I loved every second of it and it has a huge amount of replayability even if you know the story from beginning to end. There's so much to find and do, so many sidequests and a metal world to explore and have fun in whether you're driving around listening to music, making up challenges or focusing on the story, it's an unforgettable experience with a very charming plot.In my experience, I played the whole game a year ago on the 360. I did as much as I can but binge played through the game doing everything so quickly that it felt it went by too quickly. It took me two to three days to complete it and towards the end, it's a little bit predictable. But that doesn't take away from the game itself. I bought this again on steam because of my fond memories and how much I loved it the first time through. I wanted to give the developers more support because this is one of my favorite games of all time. The characters feel real, the story is heart tugging and charming, and the world of Brutal Legend is unlike anything anyone else has created and I believe it deserves more credit than it is given.In short, This game is full of references to old bands and a love note to metal and rock itself. If you love RTS games as well as open world games, this game is perfect for you. It has a brilliant selection of music and you'll find yourself rocking out as you play and have fun. I'd say buy it no matter what, on sale or not, it's worth it. If you don't like RTS, and don't have a controller to make it easier to play, that might mess with your enjoyability of the game but if it's on sale, I say buy it even if you don't like that type of game. The story is enough to have you keep playing even with the multiple times you'll get frustrated (as I have) and it is just a brilliant game. I can't say enough good things about it."

It was a weird hybrid of action adventure infused with RPG elements and RTS stage battles, tributing to metal music (actual metal music...) It was a mix-up of game genres that typically wouldn't work very well together. In Brutal Legend's case, the team at Double Fine pulled off a masterpiece. This game doesn't really have a place in any game genre, but it doesn't need to because it belongs into it's own category of weird quirky games what work exceptionally well. The first hour or so of the game, it seems like a typical action adventure open world game, until you get to doing your first stage battle... The game then becomes a hyperactive RTS for the battle sequences. Overall, this game is well worth the price, and it will be hard to put down once you step into the metal gods twisted and sickly awesome world."

Що здивувало мене найбільше це каст гри. Легенди року як Озі, Роб Хальфорд та Леммі Кілмайстер озвучили своїх же персонажів в цій грі мене заставило трішко просльозитися.

,Recommended,225260,10009763,"Posted: 3 May, 2014",all,Gecinyuszi [HUN],"Brütal Legend is a fun action/adventure game with a lot of comedy in the World of Metal which is now been enslaved by a demon, and you Eddie Riggs, need to free it.The game has a great atmosphere with excellent music and responsive combat system. Also the game manages to mix open world action with some strategic grand scale battles with bosses. Graphics and art design are also Brütal and appealing to look at.Probably the only problem is that the AI sometimes plays it easy, while other times make it really hard for you, mostly on these strategic stage sessions. These battles therefore can be a little stiff sometimes and hard to beat. Issuing orders and keeping the battlefield together is also really hard in this view.The side missions are fun, but after a while you will see that most of them are repeating quests and they are the same except for some.The game is fairly long (around 12 hours) with (a my opinion) kinda lame ending. There is a multiplayer also, but without matchmaking, so you can pretty much just play with your friends.Brütal Legend is a rare gem in the action genre and a very fun game to play. I would definitely recommend to metal/rock fans, or even those who are just looking for some fine action.8/10 Awesome !"

76561197992229015,Recommended,225260,26589237,"Posted: 13 November, 2016",all,Dire,"This is the most Metal game you have ever played, and probably will ever play. If you play it. I'll be honest here, this is a pretty unique game, not just in music and art direction, but also in gameplay. If you hate Metal I doubt you're going to enjoy the game and its story very much, which is filled with nods to those elements. It practically lives of it. So, this review is based on the fact that you ♥♥♥♥ing love Metal.The story is pretty decent, it's got great voice acting, still enjoyable graphics, good cutscenes, interesting characters and villains (at least some of them), though you'll never going to get to dig too deep, so the characters remain somewhat shallow mostly. Still, a fun ride.Bonus points for some rock and metal legends being represented in the game: Lemmy, Ozzy, Jack Black himself of course...From a technical view point, the game still holds up about 7 years later on Windows 10 and works pretty flawlessly. Just make sure to set FOV and camera distance to max. There are some hitches in the vehicles sections, but that's about it. Sound is obviously fantastic.Now let's get on to the gameplay: BEWARE, this game ""looks"" like a 3rd person brawler, but it's really not. Not at all. While you can and will engage in typical brawls with your weapons, the system is rather basic and you will mostly do so during certain missions and the early stages of the game. Slight spoiler alert: The latter stages of the game (about 2/3s or so) will be more of a RTS, in which you will also fight yourself. This means that you are going to have a base (the stage) and you'll need to capture resource nodes (fans) to train your different units. As the game progresses you get more and more units to choose from. Each of them do something different: There are basic melee and ranged units, a healer, advanced melee and ranged units, siege units, ultimate units, aoe units, etc.These can be ordered around via the D-Pad on your controller to attack, defend, follow, whatever. Many of the later missions revolve around your ""tour"", i.e. you need to get your tour bus to a certain location at which a stage battle or stage defense will take place. Later on you'll not just have to crush your enemy, but also accomplish certain goals to be able to. You can personally take part in those battles or view them from different angles and just direct your troops, though that won't get you far probably. Better than just hacking away at enemies, however, is the use of your special abilities, called ""solos"". With these you can buff your allies or ""melt the faces"" off your enemies for example. Beware that you need to FIND those solos first in the open game world. Without face melter for example the game becomes much more difficult. Same as with solos you can also get upgrades for your character and his car, but you need points for that. You can do side missions to get more of those, but they are not really necessary and they are kinda boring.The stage battles can get a bit tedious after a while, especially if you would rather brawl around, but well, that's just the way the game was designed. If you're really not into that, better not buy and watch a bit on YouTube first or watch the whole story and gameplay.I didn't play the MP portion of the game, but I imagine it's a) pretty much dead and b) probably more stage battles. Since there are 4 factions in the game, each with different units (2 are pretty similar), I assume you can just play as any one of them.Bottom line: If you like Metal, give it a try, on easy it's not too difficult, only the last 2 battles are a bit annoying."

Obviously the theme of the game is Heavy Metal and there is a lot of that in there. Some of the cameos are painful, but having a wide library of music to play while you drive around is pretty cool.During the game, there are these really out of place RTS battles. It is a welcoming change of pace to the game, but gets really old really quick and seems shoehorned in. There is even a multiplayer version of it no one will play.RTS shoehorns aside, this game is pretty good.

He's not an awful person, I just find his persona to be a bit annoying.At the same time I like Metal music, I'm not an uber fan, and I feel like at times this game expects you to be an uber fan of Metal music to really love this game.  Since I'm not at that level, I still enjoyed the music, but banking so much on one style of music is a pretty gutsy move.The story feels like it almost lags in the second half of the game, what began as a really interesting and funny premise seems to be monotonous in the second half.   You go from a gorgeous landscape to well three rather dull locations.  The game switches from the action adventure feel to more RTS battles which each feel quite dull especially after you had a Zeldaesque experience.And finally there's the gameplay.  I like Zelda, and I mostly like RTSes, Brutal Legend though found a way to make me kind of hate it's gameplay as a mix of the two.  The RTS sections aren't exactly thrilling, and the adventure parts of the game are dull.So clearly I dislike it right?Well the first half of the game has a lot of great moments.  While the second half really isn't as good, the first half is pretty sweet, the second half just is ok.  The gameplay as an RTS isn't annoying like many RTSes and it allows you to fight instead of just being an RTS, so it's not fully committed to RTSes, where some games are all or nothing, and the final battle is kind of cool and different.  It's not a battle you can just win, but you have to just barely survive, if you know how (and if you don't, you'll have to figure it out)The metal in the game is awesome.  Having Ozzy Osbourne have a cameo is brilliant, so much of the music is awesome, and the story is quite metal.  In fact the entire sound and music in the game is AMAZING.  Definitely worth playing.And as I said I'm not a huge Jack Black fan, but I liked him in this.  So that worked.  Even his over the top antics works great for when you're doing a stage slide past an enemy and grinding on a guitar.This is a game where I recommend it with some big caveats.  If you don't like heavy metal (or just metal/rock in general)  you're going to have a bad time.  If you don't want to play an RTS (because make no question about it, this is an RTS even if it starts off as an adventure game) you're going to have a bad time.  If you want a really strong story, you're ... you get it, right?But at the same time I'm not a huge Tim Schaeffer/Double Fine fan, and most of his games leave me a little flat.  This game really made me happy, even if it's not perfect, so I recommend it, but you really have to understand that even the demo doesn't give a good representation of the final product, and that does kind of annoy me(the bait and switch).  But if you want to see a new take on an RTS, or hear some awesome Metal music while playing a game, this is really your only option."

This game basically makes him the badass we all know he is, and lets you play that awesome character. The game is visually stunning, always picking the best view when you are idle. The soundtrack is BOSS, but, being Jack Black he made sure it would be.The story, while a little bit cliche it would seem at times, is very entertaining and enjoyable. The combat however, is kind of repetetive at times to me, but still enjoyable with the mix of the guitar and the solos you can play. Jack Black playing the voice of the main character makes this game golden to me, and the suprise appearance of several other famous people makes it even better.Overall I give this a 9/10 and would recommend this game to anyone looking for a good time. The derpy multiplayer is the only thing I really don't like about the game.*EDIT*change  ""the badass we all know he can be if he wanted to""to ""the badass we know he is"""

Some of the collectibles in the game reveal the world history in a cool way.+ Great voice talent and cameos.+ THE BEST SOUNDTRACK FOR ANY GAME EVAR.- Ok... the ending... it's one of those, ""Thats it?"" endings.  Big let down.  I would have preferred them going with some old videogame trope like ""No, I am the actual big bad guy behind it all, and now you have to fight me"" then you turn into Ormagodden (the god in that world) and fight.  I would have been all for that.  This ending just kind of tainted the game for me.- Its an open world game, and it suffers from open world game tropes like repetive missions, fetch quests, and hunting for collectibles- Repetitive voice-overs, ""We're just marching around kicking♥♥♥♥♥quot;- Like I said, the first 30 minutes are awesome, the rest of the game, the humor and pacing kind of fall flat.  I really feel like they could have done so much more with what they had here.- Some of the characters are under developed.- The vehicle controls are very brick-ish.  That being your primary mode of transportation for the entire game makes brick-ish handling unacceptable.- The pop-in.  I know this is a console port, but even with the draw distance maxed out, I still had things materializing right in front of me.  Its just kind of annoying.So, with all this said, I am still recommending this game... only if you are a fan of the music genre.  Otherwise, stay away."

Guess which side won.Initially, I'm somewhat glad that side was victorious. Brutal Legend is from what I've seen so far (little over half and hour) a third person hack-n-slash adventure game. The controls are simple and easy to pick up on but at the same time leave room to enhance one's skill with combos and strategy.  Graphics wise it leaves a tad to be admired, and the game has a fussy camera system which is especially prominent in the vehicle segments.I don't have any right to make a comment on the story yet, but I can say that the writing has a charming, casual approach to the brutal nature of the games world.The game also features Jack Black (School of Rock, Kung-Fu Panda) as Eddie Riggs, while I'm not the biggest fan of Jack Black I honestly can't see anyone else filling in the role except for him.So far, it's a pretty fun experience, it's rather obvious that it's been ported from the Playstation but that hardly gets in the way of the gameplay.FYI, these are my initial thoughts on the game, further into the game they may change."

When the game first gave me control of the character and you grab an axe stuck in the ground children of the grave by black sabbath starts playing as you fight some demons, at that point I knew this game was most definately for me. It has a pretty cool story (you have to unlock some of it by finding statues scattered across the world, oh yeah its open world did I not mention that?). There is a fair bit of comedy. And ofcourse there is the music, lots and lots of music. Basicly if you aren't too worried about having the best combat and are more into just having a silly fun game with a lot of hard rock and metal then this game is for you. It gets  a 9/10 from me (not a 10/10 due to some of the combat not being as good as I would have liked)."

You get sucked into a world full of trees made of car mufflers, spiders that spin steel bass strings instead of web, and a ""Wailing Wall"" made up of giant guitar amps instead of bricks and mortar.The story is incredibly tongue-in-cheek and had me chuckling on several occasions. They poke fun of heavy metal throughout the game, but at the same time you can tell they have a deep love for it. It has great voice acting (Jack Black normally gets on my nerves but he's fine here), and an excellent soundtrack (assuming you can tolerate heavy metal).The gameplay is your standard open-world character action game, but what sets it apart is the RTS element which is pretty divisive. Personally, I love it, and am surprised more people didn't get into it. They've spun it out into a full-fledged multiplayer mode with matchmaking, and I'm looking forward to digging into it even more. It does have a steep learning curve, but once you get the basics down there is a lot of fun to be had.Definitely a game worth checking out if you haven't already."

Well while Jack Black's performance was good, I don't think his voice the character design very well, but that's very nitpicky. In the game, you brawl, battle, and drive as Eddy and uncover his story along the way. In the game, you have RTS segments, hack&slash segments, driving, and side missions. Going through each one, the RTS segments can seem daunting at first as you get new units and find out how the system works, but once you get then hang of it, its a decent amount of fun if not a little frustrating. The hack and slash segments are ok, but get very monotonous very quickly since you basically have a melee attack and a ranged attack with a strong and weak one for each. Overall it's not bad just not great despite the combos you can buy later. The driving is less than good, the car is hard to control in tight spots and it's basically the only means of transport. You can deck out your car with weapons, armor, etc. but nothing fixes the lousy control and it is an absolute essential part so that weighs it down. The side missions for me, are the almost as bad as the driving. Some are fun, some are not, but in doing them all, there are so many repeats and they are tedious and infuriating.  As for the music, it is all bout the metal. If you are a fan of metal in any capacity you will enjoy the metal songs they picked from various artists, these play while you're driving which makes the driving a little more redeemable. As for the story while not bad it's not amazing which seems to be the theme of this game overall. Putting everything together, gameplay, story, music, and the like. This game gets a 6.7/10."

Sure it doesnt do anything brilliant mechanically (although generally well executed) and the radial menu is finicky at best with a mouse but the rest of the game is pure gold. The enviroments are utterly gorgeous (very ""metalized"" e.g. everything is infused with stylized iconic heavy metal imagery)  The writing is mostly very well written and often hilarious. The stylized character models lend to expressive facial animations which add immense value to cutscenes. The RTS mechanic for major battles throughout the story is well executed albeit very basic for veterans of the RTS genre, but accessible for people who've never touched an RTS. And the soundtrack. The original game soundtrack is fantastic, add to that 100+ of the best metal songs ever made and you'll often find your head bobbing while you hack through demons."

Anyone who worships at the altar of metal will be smiling all the way through - it's worth going back to the forges just because it's Ozzy in there - and the combination of the stylised artwork and impressive soundtrack mean that sometimes you want to drive around just for the sheer hell of it. And because EA (yes, that does say EA, and this may well be the last original game they've produced) went for art over photorealism it's aged well, very well indeed.However it's not without it's downsides, which are all gameplay related and could easily ruin it were it not for everything else being so much fun. The hand to hand combat is fairly basic, the controls are cluncky, and the longer base capturing missions in the campaign can get very frustrating - although the last one does a bit to make up for this with the usual RTS trick of giving you all your toys and toning down the difficulty a little. The side missions are fairly standard open-world fare, but come in only four flavours, and the upgrade progression could be better balanced - in the later game I frequently went to the forge only to decide I was happy with what I had whilst waiting for some killer new upgrade that never came.So to be honest, if this was a generic open-worlder, and bear in mind this is open-world 2009-style, it would be mediocre at best, but it's not. It's a heartfelt tribute to the gods of metal. In most open-worlder's the plot is subservient to the game, but in Brutal Legend the plot rules and however frustrating some of the missions get you'll keep going because you'll want to see the next cut sequence - and these are beautiful things.You will smile, you will laugh, and you may well shed a tear, you will hear some of the greatest music ever made - and you will rock on."

,Not Recommended,225260,30241188,Posted: 28 February,all,UtharQ,"I consider myself a metal fan but I've grown to hate this game.Let me say why. The gameplay is simply f*cking atrocious. I was very excited to finally get to play this game and the beggining delivers a lot of ""that's awesome"" moments. The soundtrack, creative and awesome open world, the general climate of the game and the story are very decent and are the best aspects of this game(thats what kept me playing even though the rest was abbysmal).However the moment I was introduced to the games main feature and worst part at the same time: ""the stage battles"", my opinion about this game shattered. This feature is simply chaos. The battles are so unorganised and rely mostly on spamming all your spells and units, hoping you kill all enemies and manage to secure tower. Theres absolutely no fineness about it, it's just mindless hack'n'slash. However in hack'n'slash at least your main weapon might do some damage and the camera angle isn't r*tarded. The command system is useless, units barely respond to you. On later stages of the game it might take around 10-15 hits (even with upgraded axe) to kill an enemy. It is so anti-fun, trust me. And the biggest problem with this is that you have to play like 7-10 of these ""stage battles"" in order to finish the game. It is so boring and annoying as they get harder with tougher enemies. There's absolutely no difference between any of those battles too(apart from scenery, they all play almost exactly the same), only final one is a bit fresh as it contains a boss(waow). Not only you have to play all of these battles but there are barely any other main mission types other than that. Sometimes you play like 3 stage battles one after another with only cut scenes in between. I hoestly had to stop playing after each one since those were annoying me so much.As I said the problem with those battles is that there's so many of them in short succession, they don't differ at all and really there's not that many other quests types in the game. It would've been fine if that was side mission activity but It's a main g*ddamn feature. There's really no variety of gameplay in main story line mission and that's what's so bad about this game.If your core gameplay is so terrible and infuriating, even the best world and sound design will not save it I'm afraid.I'm very sorry to say this but I wouldn't bother with this game. Listen to the soundtrack on youtube, close your eyes and you will get better experience than playing this crap. It's a huge shame as the first 2-3 hours are very enjoyable. It all goes downhill from there.Avoid it :/"

There are too many things wrong with this game that make it unenjoyable.The car controls are absolutely terrible with bad camera angle, you can hardly see where you're going most of the time. Same with combat, that feels clunky and terrible also.Because of this I had to do the bridge section several times and then listen to the same dialogue repeated again each time you fail.I tried to give the game a chance and keep playing, but I don't like it, Iam not a fan of metal, but thought the game looked like fun,  it's not though, the gameplay is half arsed and just feels strange. The game is repetitive, slow paced and boring overall.I only like the crazy characters and dialogue, but without good gameplay the game isn't worth it and it's hard to keep playing just for the characters.I'd say this game is for heavy metal fans only, most things about the game just seems stupid.I got this game on special for $2.49 USD and this game is not even worth getting on special, I wont bother wasting my time playing it anymore even if it was free.Don't recommend this game 4/10 bad.

The end result is a cluster♥♥♥♥ that lacks both the mindless brütality of butchering your way through hordes of enemies, as well as any real strategic depth. I ♥♥♥♥ing love metal, and the game's aesthetics and humor, character design, soundtrack - it's amazing. Everything about this game is amazing, except the gameplay. I really enjoyed the start of the game, where it plays solely like a hack-and-slash. Cranked up the difficulty to max and comboed my way through hordes of enemies, and fun bosses. But then the game shoves its weird psuedo-strategy thing in your face, and from that point on most of the game consists almost solely of these so-called ""stage battles"".The strategy ultimately boils down to rushing down your opponent all day every day, with one huge blob of units. Even if there was room for more elaborate strategies than ""send all the dudes forwards"", your overview of the battlefield, combined with the hectic hack-and-slash pace of it all makes it impossible to stop and focus for any given moment. You'll find yourself in a situation, then, where you're just trying to charge at enemies and at least enjoy the hack-and-slash - only to realize that everything the game has taught you so far about combos, timing your blocks, and so on, is ultimately pointless. Your only way to make any sizeable difference in a fight is to use ""Double Team"" - ie. taking control of one or several of your units and spamming their one or two attacks. At least solos are still fun.Bottom line, this game, on paper, might just be the best video game ever made. Though in practice it turns out that hack-and-slash and real time strategy simply do not blend. If we ever get a Brütal Legend which focuses solely on one type of gameplay at a time - preferrably the hack-and-slash - then I might just give the team my entire wallet and call it a day. Until then, might wanna dodge this one."

,Not Recommended,225260,24411912,"Posted: 19 July, 2016",all,TheGreatPiggy,"Brutal Legend seems to have a lot of unique things about it. It's obvious heavy metal world, the blending of RTS and normal third person RPG combat, and lots of different troops to command. However, despite the potential, it fails to execute these elements properly.Open World- The open world system common to rpgs does have some good aspects about it. There are things to find that give you rewards, and the environments, while generic, do vary quite a bit (you have grasslands to desert to snowy areas and so on). There are many probles however. First of all, it doesn't incorporate the heavy metal theme quite as well as one would imagine. Sure, there are momuments and such relating to music, but most of the areas just seem bland.Why Open World?- The bigger problem, however, is that there's not much point in having the open world. Unlike other rpgs, this game only has an open world to store a few, repetitive side quests, and some collectables that give Fire Tributes (the game's currency) and more songs to play (abilities per say), all of which could have easily been contained within something like a mission system.Compared to Other Open Worlds- In a worthwhile rpg, there would be a variety of secrets and such to reward exploring, while in Brutal Legend, you'll only find a few abilities that can sometimes be pretty useless and small amounts of fire tribute. The only interesting thing are the bits of lore you can discover, but this isn't nearly enough content to justify the usage of an open world. In other rpgs, you'll find many unique and interesting wildlife/enemies/npcs that spice up the gameplay. In Brutal Legend, there will be only a small handfull of wildlife in a large part of the map, without even as much as pockets of specific types being spread out to add to the environment. You will find npcs around, but they only serve to give you sidequests or give a line of dialogue. There are enemies, but it's pointless to kill them, and they are of no threat as you will be in your car most of the time.""Driving""- Ah, the car, the Deuce, or the piece of trash (whatever you want to call it). The problems listed above could have been passable if it were not for the fact you have to use your car most of the time. The controls on it are finicky and seemingly random. Turning is, by far the main problem. Most of the time, holding down A and D won't turn much at all, but sometimes if you do as much as press on of them once you'll go 90 degrees in that direction. This problem only adds on to the next problem in that your car feels completely weightless. Say, if you graze a rock, instead of holding its ground and only wavering for a bit, the Deuce will turn 90 degrees and go completely off course. Fantastic. And this only adds to the next problem in that the camera doesn't move with your car. Now, I know some games with vehicles allow you to move your camera freely all the time, but here, well, let's just go back to the original situation. Due to bad turning mechanics, you hit the edge of a hill or something. Due to the weightlessness of the car, instead of keeping on track, it starts turning towards the mountain. Due to the non-fixed camera, you keep on holding W to make your car go foward, only for it to turn to the hill within a matter of seconds, and at top speed, your car drives (or attempts to drive) up the hill. If there was a fixed angle, as soon as the car wavers towards the mountain, you would notice and press A or D respectively to combat the turn. These problems make it a pain the traverse the world, and you HAVE to use the Deuce as there's no fast travel system.Combat- Definently not as bad as driving, but it could use some work. So you have two main attacks: a melee attack and an auto-target long ranged one...and that's about it. There are combos that you get and unlock and songs that you can play, but it all amounts to the same result (songs are okay, but combos aren't worth remembering). Enemies attack differently, but there's no real strategy to beat them with. Unlike other rpgs, there's no weakpoints or vulnerability to attacks or really anything. It's just hack 'n slash. Okay, but what about those rts elements? Surely those will make up for it! Well, again, it's okay. Better, but still just okay. During battles you can summon troops and all, but you're limited on commands on what to do with them. And you can't really split up your army easily, nor do you have to as the enemies and terrain are just as bland. So battles will just be:Summon troops--> Attack--> Summon more troops--> Attack--> RepeatAll it comes down to is ""Who has the bigger pile of troops?"". Okay, but maybe the troops are so complex that having advanced control of your army isn't needed! Again, not really. They are different, and there's even specific missions dedicated to most of the troops, but it just comes down to spamming as much troops as possible. As long as you have enough melee and ranged and maybe a healer, then you're fine. You can't really summon troops to counter your specific enemies or anything complex like that.Sidequests- As said before, there are sidequests. Every once in a while you'll find a unique quest, but most are just bland repeats of a simple objective. So in my gameplay, I've really only played at most 6 different sidequests. And these sidequests, while different, are just as bland as combat battles. Also, there's a questline for racing. It's not fun. At all. (I could talk about racing but this review would probably be 50% longer)Fire Tributes- You get these by exploring and doing sidequests, and you can only spend them at Motor Forges for upgrades to things like the Deuce or your attacks (and for some reason Motor Forges aren't even introduced in a tutorial or main storyline). I wouldn't say these upgrades are minor, but again, they're bland and don't change up gameplay much, only help you progress by giving more DPS or something. Also, you get a crap load of fire tributes over time, so doing all the sidequests or exploring isn't neccesary or rewarded much (going along with the problem with the open world).Story- The story is really what's making me finish the game. It's not groundbreaking or overly good or anything, but like any story it's nice to know how it progresses. One redeemable thing I like is how it shows the journey of the player and the npcs moving around rather than there just being one main base you always return to. Unlike sidequests, the main missions also give much different objectives, but they're just as bland.Music- Adds to the environment, of course. I mean, it's a game based on metal. There's not much to say other than that the music exists. Personally, I like the selections, but if you can't tolerate the genre, then you shouldn't even bother getting the game.Main Probems- All of what I'm saying boils down to this: skilless combat and crappy driving. The two main elements of the game are not executed too well. The combat does some unique things, but feels so bland and skilless, ultimately taking away from the other aspects like the sidequests. If this were the only problem, then the game would still be commendable (for it's price, anyways), but the driving just ruins it. It destroys a whole line of racing quests, isn't fun, and makes the open world system feel more unneccesary than it already is. The driving is what truly makes the game not worth it."

,Recommended,225260,10054786,"Posted: 8 May, 2014",all,ThrillLizard,"Developer Tim Schafer has been delivering funny games for the past two decades, but none of them have enjoyed the marketing push of Brutal Legend. Gaming's best kept secret has been given the limelight. Has Schafer and his studio Double Fine created something worthy of all this attention?Oh, hell yeah. This is one of the best games I've played all year and it provides something we don't find often enough in this industry: a unique experience. I'm pretty sure you've never played a game quite like this before. True, a game needs to be more than ""different"" to work -- it has to be fun. And Brutal Legend is a lot of fun.It all kicks off with a hilarious intro poking fun at the softer, more mainstream direction heavy metal has taken in the past couple decades. Brutal Legend is front heavy with the humor stuff, though. While the first half hour will have you shooting milk through your nose, the laughs eventually taper off leaving you with a story that is rich and bizarre but lacking in the bite of the opening scenes. Brutal Legend is a celebration of classic heavy metal and takes every cheap shot it can at hair metal, nu metal, and other diluted variations on the genre. While the ultimate evil and its minions are truly terrible monsters, the lesser bad guys are made up to resemble glam rockers or emo kids. It will appeal most to those that spent at least some of their formative years as angsty headbangers although it isn't exclusionary.Brutal Legend lives up to its name: there is plenty of delightful gore to be found here, although the cartoon art style softens the effect. Heads are chopped off, blood is splattered, and faces melted, but it's all in good fun. The game is rated M for Mature, so theoretically if you're playing you're old enough to appreciate that sort of thing, but regardless you can choose to turn the gore on or off at any time. That might be a handy feature if you have kids that wander into the room from time to time while you're playing. The same can be done with the game's harsh language -- you'll even get the classic Parental Advisory sticker over any middle fingers that are flipped. Not to mention free  DLC for the steam port"

Half of the HUD goes missing when using the telescopes until you quit & restart the game being an annoying one. Some sound effects missing on cutscenes (Spider Queen shouting I think was one example), Tutorial HUD button presses missing for troops when you go to mining pits (I went to ""reassign controls"" to figure out what buttons do what to pass that part so not game-breaking bug) and same goes for when you do your first stage battle in campaign, it's missing the ""TAB"" Button display and had to check ""Reassign Controls"" to find it... so no game-breaking bugs just a few annoying ones. The graphics are impressive and the controls for everything work well minus maybe the Radial menus are a bit pickey with the mouse but that might come easier in time. 9 / 10 I'd give this game only the bugs hold it back."

In addition, you will be able to upgrade your car in the motor forges, unearth statues which will unlock new songs to listen to while driving, learn guitar solos that comes with various effects and so on.Pros :-Story and dialogue is top notch-The world is filled with lore and great ideas. The attention given to the details isexceptionnal-Fans of metal will feel right at home, others might be put off-Songlist is long and covers all the main metal subgenresCons :-Gameplay is underwhelming in every aspects, combat feels tame and upgrades don't seemto deepened it at all-Anyone who has played at least one mediocre RTS will rage over the RTS elements presentin the gameplay. They are clunky and some basics are not even present-Tad too long-Achievements are mostly grindyFinal :Clearly a labor of love, this game is for fans of Schafer/Double Fine and Metal music (or both such as myself), a shining example of ""better than the sum of it's part"". Nevertheless if you are not a fan stay clear8.5/10"

Surprisingly because you would think that Jack Black would do a better job.  But unsurprisingly because a large group of the voice actors are not actually actors at all.  The graphics are a bit sub par on this game to be completely honest.  BUT that being said, it's one of the best features of the game.  The glitchy graphics make even the most serious cutscenes hilarious when girls' hair flies everywhere or their breasts jerk upward for no reason.  Other than that, this is one of my favorite games.

It was an awesome concept that was poorly done.Based off of the trailers I expected a Legend of Zelda meets metal.  Instead I found myself playing a Legend of Zelda meets metal meets Dawn of War meets GTA meets.... well you get the point.  That was of course after I spent hours trying to get it to run properly.This game just lacked direction in what it wanted to be and game play suffers for it.  The combat is meh, the battles have no real strategy, and the car... that piece of s*** CAR!  Driving controls are awful with a bad camera and the majority of the game requires you to drive.  Blasting metal tunes doesn't make it any better (which I do on my way to work in the real world).  If you're in a race and slightly bump into something (which you will cause controls suck) you might as well start over.Some positives is that the world itself is well done.  I think that's the only reason I'm still playing it.  I want to see the sights and learn the lore of world. Its clear the developers put a lot of thought and passion into it.  I get a kick every time I see Ozzy Osbourne as the Guardian of Metal and the cut scenes are also fun to watch.  I can see that they thought it was epic enough to support different genres in one game.

An example region, Mashlands covered in a dense fog that's the home of emo-nightmare before Christmas creatures and people.Another example, imagine Amazon jungles with panthers that shoot lazers out of their eyes while being road by warrior women from KISS' album 'Love Gun'.Gameplay:The game starts out as a 3rd person hack and slash with driving and overall RPG- Action/Adventure where the hero explore this amazing world I talked about above. You soon assemble an army, from this point you become a commander and a warrior...the game then becomes a RTS. It's a very interesting shift in gameplay.Story:The story honestly reminds of something from a Black Sabbath or RUSH album. I can't put it into words without spoiling it.I think the best way to play this is jump in head first.Soundtrack:One of the greatest soundtracks out there. If you want to cut your teeth on metal, rock, or just something new for those of you who don't normally listen to heavy stuff, look no further. The soundtrack that comes with the game for $19.99 is the OST written for the game (Not the one with Ozzy, Iron Maiden, and so on) .

76561198032077057,Recommended,225260,35138304,Posted: 22 September,all,Knux897,"I'm a little late to the party with Brütal Legend, as I had seen the game release about 8 years ago and now I've finally played through it. At the time of release, I was interested in the product but had seen it sink under mixed reviews and so was delayed playing it until now, when I could get it on Steam for a cheap price.So what do I think? The game is... fine. There's a lot to like. The setting is a satire of metal as a genre and its imagery. The game starts off explosively and gets you engaged with the world and its music. The music itself is an excellent and extensive collection of metal, focusing mostly on Traditional Heavy Metal, Thrash Metal and Black Metal.Within the actual metal scene of the 80s, Hair Metal rose as an abomination meant to be commercially marketed to teenage girls and brought MTV to life, and the game certainly acknowledges this as a parody. One of the main villains is named General Lionwhyte, who takes the stereotypes of Hair Metal bands like Mötley Crüe and Warrant and blows them up to disgusting levels. This isn't to say that I don't like Hair Metal, but I appreciate that the game acknowledges the history of the genre and parodies the attitudes of the people of the time. It makes for quite an interesting character and faction that follows him.The game also has a few cameos from stars like Ozzy Osbourne (The Guardian of Metal as it were) and incorporates stage and album imagery into the world (for example, the Screaming Wall, which is a giant cliff of amps). In addition to this, imagery from the metal culture (occult symbols, fire, demons, black clothing with spikes) creates an excellent atmosphere.Your guitar can be used as a weapon to play solos (which have a number of both combat and non-combat functions) as well as strike enemies with lightning from afar as a ranged weapon. The in game menus are designed to complement the atmosphere and they do it well (they were designed by Joe Kowalski who worked on some of the Guitar Hero and Rock Band games). Last, the main menu is designed to look like Jack Black is looking through the packaging of a vinyl disk and is easily the most unique menu aesthetic that I've ever seen. Jack Black too also voices the main character Eddie and does an excellent job with it.Where the game fails is in its gameplay itself. It's essentially a shallow hack and slash, with some clunky driving portions. Where the game really suffers though, is the RTS gameplay. There are a number of campaign missions where you're required to build a stage and use groups of units to take down the enemy. You must also hold checkpoints, which are essentially geysers that spout of fans (of your band) and allow you to summon more units. I like the audacity of attempting to combine a hack and slash with an RTS, but the RTS moments are just so poorly implemented. They end up feeling like a chore and heavily detract from the game. And while the game world is interesting at first, the farther you delve into it, the more you realize that is has no depth and becomes quite boring. You can do side missions, but the more I got into the game, the more tired the gameplay got and so I didn't bother.So is the game worth a recommendation? I'd say yes. I think if you're a fan of metal as a genre, you'll appreciate what this game was trying to do and the love that went into it. I believe that a single play-through is worth your time, but because of the subpar hack and slash gameplay, as well as the poor RTS implementation, there's not much replay value. As a fan of metal, the game is worth the price to me (as of now 9/22/2017 it is $15)."

And that's a shame because - based on heavy metal or not - this as an imaginative and fun game with amazing graphic style and impressive soundwork (both in voice-acting and music).Unfortunately, the actual game portion of this title suffers in comparison, with unimpressive minigames, unfocused gameplay and unwieldy controls. I loved /exploring/ the spectacular world that the developers had created and interacting with its colorful characters, but found the combat, the driving and the platforming to be tedious at best. Sadly, this seems to be par for the course for Doublefine; I loved the settings of both Stacking and Psychonauts but couldn't stand the gameplay of those titles either. Ultimately, I gave up on Brutal Legend long before I reached the end, albeit not without remorse, as the world is that interesting. But I just couldn't take the gameplay anymore."

Satisfyingly ludicrous story. Boring to play.Boring boring boring.Quite a few different types of attacks are provided early on in an attempt to spice things up, but that's offset by the poorly designed levels, super low variety in enemies, and generally unsatisfying combat.I shared my discouragement with a friend, who said it was too soon to judge as I'd not even progressed to the first ""stage battle"". Fair enough.The first stage battle consisted of defending a location against multiple waves of 3 types of enemy set against a pretty, non-interactive backdrop. The 3 enemy types were duplicates of the 3 friendly until types I was employing, making the battle both more bland and more confusing. Bleh. At least static defense sidesteps the poor level design issue.Recommend searching YouTube for ""Brutal Legend Movie"" and mailing Tim Schafer $5 as an alternative.According to Steam, I played Brutal Legend for a total of 2.6 hours.

Controls are awful.- To move camera angle, you have to move your mouse, but the sensitivity doesn't go high without using external software.- Radial command things are weird and it actually behaves like a thumbstick. With a mouse, you'd think moving the mouse in a circular motion will pick the option you want, but it's actually all about moving in a direction. Let's say you want to pick the upper left option. You have to move the mouse into the upper left position. It sounds obvious when I explain it, but it's just really weird.- The second mission or so has you drive over a collapsing bridge. This is early in the game so I don't consider it a spoiler. It's actually just the tutorial part for the car controls. The car handles so horribly that you can be pressing left to try and avoid a gap and the car either goes left and drives up a wall or it goes left very slowly, driving into the giant hole in the floor.This game could be so freaking heavy metal badass but the controls are just all wrong and slow.

,Recommended,225260,11994627,"Posted: 5 September, 2014",all,DRUNK_CANADIAN,"I'm going to be brutally honest with you, brutal legend is an amazing with a unique design, fusing music (specifically metal/rock), real time strategy and action-rpg.  The balance is just right, and the world you explore is amazing and detailed, giving you lots of opportunities when you are not progressing the main storyline to explore and take on side tasks if you desire. The game's hero is voiced by Jack Black and he brings his signature humor to the game, coupled with other celebrity appearances lending to the atmosphere of the game. Returning to the gameplay, the combat is almost single hero based with squad control, and basic single base RTS elements which it executes well (very intuitive with controller). The story is something I'd rather not spoil, but it is characteristic of Metal, and Metal themed media, that being said, even if you as the gamer are not a fan of the genre there is still a rich world and character interactions/story elements that are applicable to all aspects of music and a solid gameplay experience which should definitely keep you involved. The only place where this game falls short, and I'm not alone in this sentiment, is near the end (spoiler free review of course), it seems like the game was going to have a decisive third act but instead it was concluded on the second act. Nobody really knows the reasoning behind this aside from probably the development team, but it left gamers wanting more even though it did still basically wrap up all the loose ends of the story. Regardless this game is a full recommendation to fans of metal/rock no all music, and those who enjoy a good action rpg. It is an accessible, quality experience which will leave you with many fond memories of it. Embrace your inner metal-head and get this game."

Don't get me wrong, I love the idea behind this and the game as some really cool mechanics, wicked humor, and is the right mix of RPG and FPS.  However, the camera in this game is annoying as hell.  Basic functions of walking or driving a vehicle will have you believing that you are drunk.  For random reasons, I have yet to figure out, the camera  changes angles indiscrimately and at critical times while trying to do something.  I mean what is the purpose (ever!) to move a camera angle to anything but behind a vehicle when you are driving it?  I don't want to see what I look like in the car, I want to see where I'm going.  Targeting enemies or getting around obstacles is more difficult than it needs to be.  After decades of FPS games on the market, how is it that a developer can screw this basic thing up so badly.  It's sad that one simple thing ruins this game so easily and that it can be easily fixed.  Not going to be playing much of this one unless the camera is patched."

You play as Jack Black who is sucked into a world of heavy metal and demons. World awesome and full of cool characters and cameos from heavy metal legends. The problem comes with the gameplay. It has elements of hack and slash, real time strategy, free roaming exploration and driving. It manages to do all of these elements quite badly. The hack and slash parts are okay, the RTS parts are terrible, the side missions are uninspired and repetitive, the mapping system is poor, The inability to jump and the sketchy driving make getting around annoying, the upgrades seem to make no appreciable difference and the story is for the most part uninteresting. I guess if you like heavy metal you'd like the sound track but once I had turned off all the songs I didn't like I was basically left listening to Mr Crowley on repeat.

The dialoge is one of the funniest I have seen in a while aswell.CONCLUSIONI havent played the whole game but for what i have played is not worth the the full price, sure the writting and characters are spot on, but they alone dont sell the game for me, if you are getting it try to get it on a sale since it is still worth a whirl, how ever it isnt a must buy."

You are left with more questions at the end than actual answers to this vast new society that you are chucked into. Character backgrounds are a big let down as there is ZERO mentioning about them so really you learn nothing apart from HEAVY METALLL!!!!!!!!Characters will drive you insane after a few hours that you will want to tear your own ears off so you don't have to listen to the same sentence when doing a side mission, over and over and over and over and over and over.... (Eddie: 'Who are we hunting today?' ""Special"" head bangers: 'BAD GUYZ!!!! Wanna help?') and that is all they say for about 10hrs gameplay in that series of missions really! I found my IQ drop for every time I talked to these NPC's that I was happy when I finally completed this abomination.Control's are awkward when trying to play stratergist on the battlefield and it gets old really quickly. Eventually you will be forced to reduce the difficulty level as the enemy side are (one hitting) your troops that it becomes more of a torture than any sort of enjoyment.Maybe they should of paid Jack Black less and actually hired a decent developer + producer and a wider range of voice actors the game probably would actually be pretty good unlike this rubbish before us! How they ever won an award is nothing short of laughable stupidity! IGN gave it a 9.0/10 seems to me they never actually played it...  it's a 3/10 at best in my opinion, so instead spend £1 on getting super Hexagon or something with a beer, as that is much more fun.I laugh at anybody who ever paid full price for this garbage, I got this at a deal price and felt they should have paid me in the end... worst purchase on steam BY FAR!"

It's one of the worst in gaming history!- Bad collider implementing for objects and environment- Very poor physics engine (after an accident no one can guess which direction your car will go!)- Car Control is a true headache (it's very hard to control your car and driving will cause motion sickness in this game)- Side missions are boring and repeatative- The strategy part of the game isn't fun at all (I wish it had gameplay like Darksiders or GoW or Devil May Cry)The Ugly:- The worst part of the game is driving (like I said in the bad part it's really really bad). And the ugly part is that this is an open world game, which means you have to use the car a lot, and experience lots of accidents with objects and animals, falling into oceans and abysses and headache from motion sickness (and I used a Xbox360 controller, god help who uses mouse and keyboard!!!). Actually when I think about it I'm so relieved that I will never play the game again.With all that I just said I'm sure that I probably can't stop you from spending 1.5$ (in 90% off) over this game, like I couldn't stop myself from buying it. But please for god's sake DO NOT spend too much time on side missions and finding collectibles and make the game 100% complete like I did.

It's a company I would love to support, but this is the end.  As usual, they're amazing at building a world, characters are good, funny etc, but gameplay is perplexingly bad.  It's like they come up with the story and plot, then outsource the gameplay to some chimps who've only played about three games before and mash them all together.  I can't explain how such a mess of a game could get released otherwise.The game is part strategy, part RPG, part Adventure.  The strategy is overly simplistic, just hurl your units at the others and give them a hand... yet you have a big ♥♥♥♥ off axe that still takes 6 hits to take out the weakest enemy.  So when there's 30 enemy, that's a lot of chopping... using your area attacks are just as weak, but they might hit three enemy at once, still takes 6 hits minimum though.The adventure part takes place in the worst sandbox I have ever encountered.  It's what I would call 'over designed'  everything looks so dense that it looks the same, so navigating is tiresome, difficult at times, and worst of all, boring.What's worse, when you spend 20 minutes. 20 sodding ♥♥♥♥ing minutes driving around, not even doing missions, simply going from one place to the next mission, getting stuck, fighting random hordes of enemies, only to make it all the way to your next mission, just nick a bit of black ground that looks the same as the rest of all the other black ground, but apparantly it was black water, which is instant death, only to get respawned WAY on the other side of the map and have to do it all again... you're♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off... When I made it back once more, I Saved it as I didn't want to start the next mission as it was now time to go and do something else as all of my time was wasted, when returning, it loaded me WAY on the other side of the ♥♥♥♥ing map again, and I had to drive all the way back.. again....Oh, and many parts of the map are identical, they just changed the colour filter, clever in its use, but lazy is lazy... OHx2, bugged up the♥♥♥♥♥♥at times, game breakingly so, only twice, but still.Lastly, and fatally.  In a game you drive a great deal, the driving mechanics are the worst I've seen in a Sandbox, and I've seen some BAD driving mechanics.So in summary, ONLY buy this if you are VERY forgiving of bad gameplay because you enjoy fun characters and settings etc, and if you are a big big fan of Double fine games...

I would be willing to forgive it it's boring fighting mechanic and pretty empty strategy mechanic (which doesn't have any real strategy to it). If this game only required you to complete one of these two chores (or a less bad ""guitar solo"" mini game) every now and then to move on to the next funny scene, I would give it 3 stars because that would be an overall fun experience. Jack Black and all his guest stars are just that fun, story is funny and the graphics are very pretty.Sadly, there is also driving. Terrible, TERRIBLE driving.Don't trust the other reviews when they describe driving as ""not great"". Driving a Yugo is ""not great"". Driving in this game leaves the impression that it has been designed by a race of ethereal beings from a non-physical plane of existence who tried and failed to imagine the experience of driving based on reading comics and studying photographs. Your car has no inertia and steering...I honestly never had a RL or virtual experience that is comparable to this steering. The closest thing that I can imagine would be driving a tank with super-traction tires on Jupiter. There are few missions that try to spice up the driving with shooting, but the aiming and shooting is, out of necessity, made very easy because keeping the car on course is challenge enough, unless that course is a straight line.I finally quit the game when a mission (won't spoil the story with background) required me to use the to escape a pursuer. There was couple of U turns on the track and...I just don't know. Maybe one of those genius kids who figure out surgery on their own at the age of 6, without ever going to school, maybe one of them could figure out how to complete a semi-challenging driving course in this game without their hearts overflowing with hate and despair.

This is just a tribute.Take the best parts of Grand Theft Auto, Saint’s Row III, The Elder Scrolls, Mount & Blade and 1980’s heavy metal music; now use what’s left over and you have Brutal Legend.  The game offers an open world, but there’s really now where interesting to go.  The challengers are repetitive (do I go to the left side of the world and ambush Nelson, or do I go to the right side and ambush Nelson.)  All that so I can by some underwhelming power up or skin from Ozzy Osborn.The game controls feel clunky.  It’s enough of a pain try to control yourself, but on top of that some missions require to boss around followers who are pretty dumb (they head bangers and rocker chicks.) Once you reach the missions where you have to command an army, having to point each unit to a specific spot on the battle field becomes painful.  The hot rod handles like a drift modified bus, and some of the car missions are unavoidable, like the very first one.The atmosphere is what Brutal Legend sells itself on, but it comes up short here too.  With the exception of Ozzy Osborne, the sound track reads like the second string of the 80’s metal all star team (no Iron Maiden or Metallica.)  The whole time I felt like I was driving to a Poison reunion show, with Great White opening (stay close to the fire exit.)In conclusion Brutal Legend tries to do too much, and does none of it well.  If you want the real 80's experience get a 2600 emulator and rock out to some Bobby Brown on cassette.  Oh yeah, almost forgot, Jack Black sucks."

I feel like it could have been better.Some of the dialog was repetitive... like every time you started a challenge/ambush-thingee.

I was getting tired of it.It's a fairly small map too. Which was nice.Played with keyboard/mouse. Didn't experience much glitching, although I got my car stuck in a bad place (*snickers*) and when I got out I bugged into a dirt mound and couldn't move.Nausea Factor: yes. at times the driving was a little too bouncy.

The sound effects and music are OK, but the story is poor, it's just a simple concept to get the game going and the gameplay is a very badly executed GTA/ action style kind of game. You'll be facing the same enemy models over and over again, the AI is terrible and raising the difficult level will only make you weaker to die with fewer blows as the foes remain dumb. The attempt of getting bot controlled allies was a failure, the metalheads dudes are even dumber than they look and they won't help you at all even if you're issuing the commands properly. The map exploration doesn't feel rewarding because it's so bland and monotonous.If you're really curious about the game, just get it on a sale for the nostalgia and/ or the collection value.

The thing that interested me in buying it was the idea: A heavy metal themed open world hack-n-slash game with RTS thrown in.I was thinking ""i must be crazy to buy something like this, the idea of making a game based on music was implemented already and it was atrocious"". I didn't play the game until about 1 year and a half of buying it. So one day i decided to give it a shot. And i ended up LOVING IT.The story has some rich lore on it with colorful and memorable characters in it. The overworld looks really cool, some landmarks look amazing.The voices are really fitting for most of these characters, Jack Black as Eddie Riggs fits like a glove. Tim Curry as Doviculus was amazing. And i like that Lemmy Kilmister and Ozzy Osborne are into the game as well. Shame that Dio wasn't on this.The units have different personalities reflected on their appearance.The battle mechanics are simplistic and fun. It feels really satisfying to chop someone's head off with the axe.And the soundtrack is ♥♥♥♥ING amazing. I ended up discovering some really amazing bands thanks to this game. Although, not everything is perfect.For instance, sometimes the enemy AI ends up being dumb and i had to cheese out some of the side missions (One of the car-lift missions i had to guide my troops to run around the area so they can find that one enemy that didn't want to go after the lift).The driving mechanic, even if it's fun sometimes, it ends up being really frustrating in the Fletus' Races, i end up hugging more walls/trees/rocks than beating races.Some of the units/elements of the game end up spoiling the plot way early than when they are supposed to happen. Like the Legend statue covered in snow, after beating the Metal Beasts mission it's already available to unlock and watch, i think that one had to be covered until the plot revealed itself. And some of the units also say stuff that spoils the plot way before the events happen. Thankfully, my first playthrough was without discovering anything at first.Even if the game has some flaws, i HIGHLY recommend this game to anyone looking for a fun hack-n-slash game, or if you are looking for a good Heavy Metal themed game.And no, i didn't ignore the fact that this game was made by Double Fine who provided us with Psychonauts, i don't want this review to be biased by this fact."

Also, being a heavy metal fan, I loved the idea of a metal-based game, but I was afraid it would be used as a gimmick (especially the celebrities) to get people to buy an otherwise average game.I bought it on sale a while back solely because it was recently ported to Linux, and I like supporting Linux game developers.After 3 nearly sleepless nights, I've reached 100% completion, only stopping to nap, work, and occasionally eat. That's how much I enjoyed this game.I should have done more research into the development team before I judged the game by its cover. They're actually a really capable team, and the game was started with a lot of vision and no plans for a celbrity cast. Instead, the celebrities joined the project after word got around, starting with Jack Black. If you're thinking about getting this game, don't let the celebrity involvement cloud your judgment: this game was meant to be long before that ever happened.I don't want to go into a huge amount of detail about gameplay and atmosphere because all of that is available in other reviews online, but I just want to emphasize that if you like heavy metal, this game is a blast. If you don't like heavy metal, the game is still fun and has unique gameplay, but I wouldn't say it's revolutionary in any way. There are similarly played games out there with better game mechanics, but none of them blend together the way Brutal Legend does. The game really feels like a cohesive experience rather than a series of actions. The character personalities are exaggerated but convincing.Despite its flaws, Brutal Legend is so original and so well-made, I would give it a 10/10 even without it having the best graphics, the best gameplay, or the most consistent storyline. The thing is, those flaws don't get to the heart of the experience the way the good parts of this game do, and they do it so perfectly, I had more fun playing this game than some other games I found more perfect from a technical standpoint. If you like heavy metal and want to have fun, play this game."

Although it looks like just a simplistic open world game with melee combat and RPG elements (upgrades and stuff), it is in fact filled with creativity and humor. The story is a bit cheesy but good nonetheless (with plot twist!), the missions are very (VERY!) short, side missions take like 2 minutes and main missions take 5-10, so it can be played quite casually and they do not get tiresome. There is a small problem that side quests are very repetitive, there are just like 4 variations, and you need to complete them in order to earn points to spend on upgrades, but like I said, they take like 2 minutes each.One very interesting aspect is that in certain parts of the game (and the multiplayer mode) it becomes a RTS game. You have your main base, you gather resources and train your army to crush your enemy base. Your main character issues orders to the army and can help during combat.The soundtrack is simply amazing, more than 100 rock/metal songs to listen to (you can choose from the playlist) while you drive your car in the open world environment, exploring things to do (there are plenty of unlockables) or navigating between missions. Too bad every time you leave your car or perform an NPC action it stops the song you are listening to.Overall this is a very fun ""change of pace"" game, specially for rock/metal fans."

I love all the small details in the game e.g. the 80's rock chicks using hairspray in the background while you're talking to another character; It's so alive! And so many references to all genres of heavy metal.The gameplay in itself has a very nice feeling to it i.e. the character moves easily around and in a nice fluid way. One downside is that you notice that it isn't a PC original by how sometimes the actions on the keyboard can become too much or just choppy to use. It doesn't ruin the game at all but it can become frustrating while playing.All in all this game is charming and wins my heart over with all the rock and metal characters presented in it. I love the Bowie inspired Lionwhyte flying away with the help of his magnificent hair and the Sea of Black Tears inspired by black and goth metal. I can go on and on and I'm smiling as I'm writing this because Brütal Legend becomes so close to the heart when you're a metalhead. I'd definitely recommend playing it even if you're not though!

Otherwise, it might not be for you.The game story is pretty much a bunch of nonsense, filled with rock and metal songs. The good points are: the main character has the voice of Jack Black, and he is definitely the highest point of the game. His sentences and his behaviour are funny, and it's almost like a game from Tenancious D. You also have some rock stars as special guests, like Rob Halford, Ozzy Osbourne and Lemmy. The combat has some flaws, but it's pretty straight forward and it's fun to play.But then we have to face the problems. Unfortunately, the game feels like it was made in a hurry or something like that. The lip-sync, when the characters talk, has some serious issues. Driving (either the car or the motorbike) is painful sometimes. It's hard to control, especially to turn. And you play in a ""free world"", where you can go wherever you want to and some side missions to choose, but they are pretty lame and the world itself is not appealing at all. You drive around, but you don't enjoy the time you spend doing so.I bought the game for 2 dollars during the winter sale, so even with all these problems, was still worth it.

No. The command system is incredibly simplistic, making it incredibly difficult to do more than send ""this clump of troops over there.""

,Recommended,225260,9213365,"Posted: 21 February, 2014",all,Lynx,"The most Metal game that ever has been or ever will be made, Brutal Legend is a tribute to all things Heavy Metal. Set in a world that can only be described as Metal Fantasy it pays homage to the fantastic (and I mean that in the traditional sense) Heavy Metal album covers that we all know and love. Ruins made from giant swords, creatures with literal steel quills for fur, demons, and giant spiders that spin guitar strings for their webs. It embodies every high concept that comes across in Heavy Metal music, and of course the soundtrack itself is staggering with over 108 licensed Heavy Metal songs hand-picked by Tim Schaefer as what he describes as ""the songs that helped define heavy metal."" Ozzy Osbourne (including his Black Sabbath and solo days), ManOwaR, DragonForce, Motorhead, KISS, and many others can be heard in this epic playlist accessable through your ingame car.Featuring the voice talents of Jack Black, Jennifer Hale, Ozzy Osbourne, Tim Curry and more!And that's just the basic premise.Once you get past that, the gameplay is pretty solid. The car controls are slick and handle quite well, the combat is varied and fun, but it starts to show where it's trying to do too much when it gets into the RTS elements of the game.  NOTE TO DEVELOPERS: Third Person is not a good way to go about RTS. If you're going to make a Real Time Strategy game, make it a Real Time Strategy game, don't fuse it with another genre. In my honest opinion this game would have been considerably better without the RTS elements, though I admit when I first played I smirked as I made a Pikmin reference in my head. In spite of my thoughts that the game starts to lose its shine here, that's all it really does: It starts to lose its shine, but it's far from being a dealbreaker. The RTS aspects are weak but there's enough of everything else to make up for it and then some.All in all if you're a fan of Heavy Metal and/or Heavy Metal album art I strongly recommend Brutal Legend as a must-have part of your collection. If you're not, I still suggest taking a look at this game just as a fun game with a unique aesthetic, I've bought this game twice now, once on PS3 and once on Steam for Linux, I'll be picking it up and playing it again down the road for years to come.

I couldn't find it funny even though Jack Black is a funny guy, he just didn't have too much humor in this game, which is why I'm wondering why the game has been tagged ""comedy"", I just didn't find the comedy very....funny. I consider Giants citizen kabuto or Armed and dangerous as funny games, which strangely enough this game reminded me of also to a certain extent.The action and combat didn't feel overly fluid to me, it worked but it just felt like all I needed to do was mash buttons. After a while the ""RTS"" sequences got a little tedious and I figured all I needed to do was rush the enemy fast to win. The upgrades to the vehicle and your character were nice, as a personal fan of black metal I'm so greatfull they didn't leave out the black metal threads.The story kinda felt like it had holes in. Like one character would be talking about something that had not really been covered and you were expected to know what they were on about, all of the sudden the main char knows about something they've never heard of. By the end though, you kinda figure it out in a rough way.For some stupid reason I had and urge to hit a button and JUMP....you can't do that..is it just me or is it annoying when you find a game you can't jump in?!?As much as I could find flaws with it, there was a lot more good and at the standard price it's well worth it if you have a good 20-30 hours to put in."

I got it on sale, and I suggest everyone does the same--not because it isn't worth it, but because I am frugal lol(https://xkcd.com/606/). Well my original expectation once I realized this was a Jack Black game was honeslt not high. His antics are sometimes amuzing, bit Pick of Destiny didn't have enough of that Greatest Song in the World vibe. But alas, I had sold this game short. It was, and is, a pleasant game I would totally recommend.It has at its core an action adventure game with an open world-esqe play area. It has elements of an RTS during battle scenerios especially where you can not only control the battle form on-high (with limitation as you are still an individual giving the commands) but also take part in the carnage yourself. It has just enough side-missions to help boost ""fire tributes"" (the currency to purchase upgrades) without being overwhelmed by pointless fetching. It also includes a few driving quests which are just challenging enough (on normal) that you (me) can breeze through it (with mouse/keyboard) without paying attention.The story is amuzing with Jack Black (Eddie Riggs) as a Roadie summoned to a mystical land straight out of Ronnie James Dio's greatest hits in order to help a resistence movement overthrown the oppresive regime of the evil Deviculous and his general Lion White. You are added on your quest by summoning units such as Headbangers, Razor Chics and Roadies to fight along side your Battle with the Bands. The source of your power? The fans! Whom you harness via Merch Booths.All of this along with an excellent metal soundtrack that make head bang and puntastic world where metal is god (literally, pay attention to the lore) make this an underrated treasure."

""What would happen in it?"" ""METAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAL!""And for that, it's awesome.Brutal Legend puts you in the hands of the world's greatest roadie, Eddie Riggs, who, by an unfortunate mishap, is sent back in time to the time where Heavy Metal ruled the land, and rock was god. Now, Eddie has to try and stop the evil fetish demons that are trying to destroy humanity. Armed with his twin axes - the double bladed Seperator and his guitar, Clementine - Eddie will destroy the swath of demons! The music is phenomenal, the combat is fun, and there's so many little easter eggs for metal fans out there. It's an excellent journey into what musicians see when they play.Also, you can bust out a Facemelter that actually melts faces. If for nothing else, buy the game just because of that."

The actual gameplay surprisingly has RTS elements with minion commanding and minor base building in the middle of the 3rd person action, but it's eased into and never approaches anything remotely as intricate as Starcraft. I was surprised by how much driving is available and how open the world was from the beginning mission compared to a GTA game; it ends up being less intricate, but more artsy in a good way. The game does an excellent job of grabbing you from the first minute with a unique setting and style, so anything shallow in gameplay is forgivable for how fun it all ends up being, with a ton of collectables.

I'll be honest with you though I'm only thinking about this after the fact, I was so emmersed in to the music and artwork that, in the moment, nothing else seemed to matter.

For that reason alone, it's hard not to give BRUTAL LEGEND an enthusiastic thumbs up for its refreshing originality (a Double Fine signature) and the sheer coolness of what it's aiming for here. I am reminded of FULL THROTTLE and this is a worthy successor to that classic.However, in practice the gameplay is more exhausting than fun. The hacking, slashing and electrifying all work great, but most of the other controls are kind of funky -- I am having particular difficulty with the damn car, and when I think of how beautifully the vehicles work in the BORDERLANDS series, for example, I know that Double Fine could have done a better job with this crucial element. The map is another example -- it took me ten minutes to figure out how to get from the map back into the game... which you DON'T do by pressing the same button that got you into the map in the first place. Frequently, the game plunks you down into an action setpiece with no guidance and no clues as to what you're supposed to be doing.It just seems that there are unnecessary awkwardnesses that could have been ironed out with just a little more time in development. And all these little things conspire to suck a lot of the fun out of what's otherwise a really unique and original game. It looks great, it sounds great, it's got style and spirit, but the controls and (so far) the lack of a really fully realized Open World keep BRUTAL LEGEND just shy of greatness."

Now for the real part.Do you like Metal and/or Rock?Do you like silly humour?Do you like Jack Black?Do you like decapitating people with an axe and electrocute their friends with a guitar?Would you like to go back in time to when the musicwas...good?""Like, how far back? The 70's?""""No, even earlier than that. Like the early 70's.""If you answered ""yes"" to at least one of those questions, then this game has something for you.You play as Eddie Riggs, a roadie who doesn't like the way music is going. Someone, somewhere may have heard him, because he somehow gets sent to a heavy metal-esque world to fight demons andother...scum?Yeah, let's go with scum. Whatever. It works. It has all kinds of Metal musicians to aid you, like Ozzy Ozbourne, ""The Guardian of Metal"". What this game lacks in polish, it more than makes up for with gameplay.So then, what's the Pros and Cons of the game?Pros:-Heavy soundtrack-Fun gameplay-Witty humor-Fun references-Neat story-Looks great-You can equip you car with rocket launchers. ROCKETS!Cons:-No health bar-Combat is a bit clunky-Most sidequests become too repetetive after a while-Kinda slow story.

Guitar solo's are interesting but tedious and slow.- The open world feels very open but with little to look at.- Instances\zones feel very linear.Can't jump. Getting blocked by simple objects is possible.I feel the game was lacking in finances and feels unfinished. They had great story and design to work with but doesn't feel like enough. Unfortunately due to forced cut-scenes I never got to see all the content.I'd love to see more games take on a similar art style (especially with metal music) and it brought back memories listening to the NIN soundtrack while playing Quake back in the 90's.

Every moment of this game is straight out of a heavy metal album cover, and it's always great to look at. While the graphical fidelity isn't the best, the aesthetic more than makes up for that, along with the good sound design and AMAZING soundtrack. The gameplay, on the other hand, is not always the best. The most fun I had with this game was at the beginning, before the RTS elements get introduced. The simple brawling mechanics and the fun driving missions and free-roaming are where the game really shines, but trying to implement an RTS with stage battles just didn't work.The stage battles are clumsy and awkward to control and direct, since you also are in direct control of Eddie the entire time while trying to direct mobs of your own forces with an incredibly unintuitive interface based around very simple ""follow, defend, attack"" commands rather than a traditional overhead point and click interface. (yes this game was originally on consoles, but still) In my opinion, the stage battle RTS sections should have either been converted to a more traditional working RTS format, or removed entirely.Aside from the Stage Battles, which comprise maybe a third of the game (and definitely aren't AWFUL, just clunky), this game is very, very good. It features tons of heavy metal icons as voice actors, a blistering soundtrack, amazing aesthetic, and good zelda-esque fighting mechanics and visceral driving segments tied together with a large open map and many side objectives.Plus, there's Manowar-inspired scantily clad amazonian ladies riding massive fire-breathing beasts of destruction that you can recruit for your cause.

What completely blew me away was that apart from creating an immersive world with an excellent score and addictive collectibles, Double Fine delivered a solid script with excellent performances by both the celebs Jack Black, Ozzy, Lemmy, Halford  and other voice actors alike. The multiplayer is also not too bad - it may play second fiddle to the action/RPG elements of single player, but the stage battles are original and all the different units are creative and fun to play.

The only downside with the side quests in my opinion is that they are repetetive and were a bit boring after doing 3 of the same. The story features Jack Black as the lead character known as Eddie Riggs trying to fight his way in the demon ages. This game focuses alot on the story music brutal scenes and humor. I got to say this game is one of the funniest games i have played for a while so thats a good thing in my book. The combat system was a bit hard at sometimes but after a while of playing it got very easy and quick to use. Eddie will not just use his car called the duece which you will be able to upgrade more when playing through the story and use to travel around the world. I only wish that they would have shown more motor forges in the game as it was very annoying knowing i had to travel far just to upgrade my vehicle. As Eddie goes through his journey he will meet allys and enemies these allys will join his crew and will be used in battle when versing bosses. These boss battles are not just any boss battles these will introduce your stage and the strategy combat system they brought into the game. You will have fans that will be used to summon your allys onto the field to help you fight the evil villians. This game also makes the strategy fights unique as you do not need to just sit up and command your troops but also fight with them to help even the odds if your crew is out numbered. The only downfall i have with this game is that they made the story too short, side missions are boring quickly and not alot of places to upgrade your vehicle. overall this game is worth the money at £3.50 and will please anyone that loves humor stragies and killing demons to save the world. i give this 8.5/10"

If you don't have a controller don't even try this game - keyboard and mouse controls can be okay untill the end of the game. Then it starts to get really hard just by its controls. Secondly - the gameplay. Mainly  it consist of 3 parts - driving in open world, typical slasher gameplay and RTS-like moments. It's fun, but rets really boring by the end of the game. However, there are side missions like gettind from point A to point B with limited time. Also this game is based mostly on 80th-90th metal, so if you don't know much about this, you are going to miss a lotGood parts about this game are great soundtrack, amazing Jack Black, lots of references to metal icons (with themselves as VA) such as Ozzy Osbourne and Lemmy Killmister and good character and location designs and more. Overall, it is a good game, but not great, and only its target audience - 80th metal fans can fully enjoy it"

After I finished the game, I found myself not able to unistall it. I was just returning in game from time to time just to drive around in the metal-looking car listening to the music!!! One of the most fullfiling game experiences I had for years. My wife still can not undestand why I suddently rise up the fist and go on headbanging while I am wearing the computer headphones... Of course, I am preocupied because i like this kind of music, so this review is definetelly not a fair one :-)I believe this game will be considered a 'cult' 'unique' experience for many years to come.Some of the Goods:- Very satisfying soundrack (101+ original metal songs included in the game, not the 'soundrack' created for the game itself, even if it is also very good to my taste), especially if you like Metal and Hard-Rock- Innovative humor and characters, full of self-sarcasm about metal and relevant 'stereotypes'- Graphics and gameworld looking like metal-album front pages- Free driving around in a metal-car with rocking driving feeling and fantastic collection of music on the cd-player, driving over wandering nusty-looking demons.- Innovation, Unique gameworld feeling, full of metal aura.Bads:- The RTS mass-combats gameplay part. At least for my taste... Checkout gameplay videos and reviews of the game if you are not-so-sure about purchasing it, or try it on easy dificulty and play the few RTS battles using your hero as a typical arcade killing-blade-maschine, since the game allows the player to select during gameplay how much he likes to be involved in other-than-main-character units commanding.- At the time I purchased the game, there was a confusion on the description of the complete edition that lead to the missunderstanding that more than a 100 original metal mp3 would be included in the download. This was not the case at the time, and I don't believe that this will change, since it sounds to be a hell of money to music-industry companies for sales-rights.- Gameplay gets a bit 'repating' after a couple of chapters."

The atmosphere, characters, and world are wonderfully done; with that said, playing this game is brutal.  Poor optimization makes for laggy performance, leading to cluttery, disconnected combat.  The disconnect between my input and receiving visual feedback also makes for a brutally difficult time driving; which is a shame since this game really wants you to drive in vehicles a lot (though frustration from trying to drive could also be attributed to the bizzare driving camera or just bad driving controls).  In short; I love this game, I just hate playing it."

There are many famous rockstars and characters you know from the real world. There are a lot of jokes you just understand as a musician. And generally, the entire game design, the game world, the characters and story are just stunning, I just love to spend time in this world.I bought this game 2 days ago and already spent 13 hours playing it, whereas I'm usually not a fan of such games. Usually I play Counter Strike and all that ego shooter stuff. However, after trying Brütal Legend I'm really SAD, that I'm done with the story already. I could just wish that there will be an add-on or  Brütal Legend 2, where you can continue slashing through this beautiful world and missions with Ophelia and the others again.The story and the beautiful world totally got me, I fear I fell in love with this game. 100% recommendation for Metalheads/Musicians and 70% recommendation for people, who just like this kind of game.Please Double Fine, go and develop Brütal Legend 2."

Here's the deal.Don't get me wrong, the story is really amazing, I mean who doesn't love a heavy metal-infested adventure with a lively, breathing world to accompany it? Oh, and don't get me started on the awesome soundtrack. Real classics in there.BUT, not everything is so nice. And, by ""not everything,"" I mean, of course, the gameplay. NEVER seen such repetitive gameplay in my whole life, I'm telling you guys. Some exceptions aside, every other battle is going to feel like a chore. The limited options gameplay-wise don't help the situation, either. Basically, it's your typical God Of War-style gameplay with strategic elements added, like you have your stage and you need to destroy your opponent's, by correctly managing your units. Every battle's like that. Now, can you see why I find it a bit tiring?On top of that, there's the tour bus ""on the road"" missions, which are all the same thing; protect your bus from the bad guy's vehicles. Boring.To make matters worse, there were times where I experienced frame rate drops for no apparent reason (still could be just my PC in this case but hey) and times where the controls were a little bit too clunky for my liking namely didn't get the job done just right.Honestly, sometimes I think the only thing that helped me get through this game is the captivating story and world (add to that the amazing characters and enemies).Final verdict, if you're a fan of heavy metal and/or games that have amazing world detail and stories, then by all means get this one. For those that look into the gameplay only, you'll get bored quickly, but will still have a somewhat wonderful experience."

Anyone who can't stand the music genre should stay away,If you're expecting a pure hack and slash adventure you'll likely be disapointed about a quarter into it. Most setpieces play out in a sort of third person strategy game that requires controling resource nodes and commanding units to attack the opposing force.Aside from the main story, side missions are scattered around the map. These are somewhat bland, mostly small wave battles and races, but they  aren't that tedious since they're over quickly. Completing them earns you points to upgrade Eddie's abilities and arsenal.Overall, Brutal Legend kept me far more entertained than most games nowadays. It manages to weave an interesting mythos  along with genuinly funny moments. I didn't mind the odd gameplay choices, and actually found them refreshing.P.s, This game was designed for consoles, and is best played with a controller."

The genre mash-up between action and strategy can be a bit jarring, especially when what you really want to do is shred, hack, and maim your enemies but it's not entirely unpleasant.  Personally, I wish those aspects of the game had been done differently but the whole concert aspect of the strategy battles fits the game.  Jack Black manages to not overshadow the rest of the game by being Jack Black.  The rest of the voice cast works well.  It's cheesy but honestly, if you can't handle a little cheese in your metal, you're probably taking things too seriously.The music.  Oh the music.  The music is why you're gonna wanna just beat the game.  The story's fun but being able to cruise such a wonderful, METAL world while cranking some killer tunes is where it's at.  The Deuce is an awesome car and the world is beautiful and fun.  So if you can just get through the story, you'll have a free world to cruise in.If someone could just combine this with Skyrim, I'd probably never want for another game."
,Recommended,225260,10696031,"Posted: 22 June, 2014",all,MrYanu,"While this game may be difficult to explain to anyone who's never played it, let me start off by saying that this has got to be one of the most underated games of the generation. With cameo appearances by some of Metal music's most iconic band members and an awesome action/driving/RTS game, it's hard not to find something to love.Most of the game takes place between open world roaming missions and battles where you are required to use your units to control resources against an apposing faction/band. While RTS may sound odd to include in an Action game, Tim Schaefer manages to do it in a unique way which (to date) has only caused me frusteration on 1 occurance.GameplayRather than giving players a simple overhead view during the RTS battles, you remain in control of Eddie Riggs who is able to fly above the battlefield or drop down to particpate in battles and inspire troops. This mechanic allows you to pop up overhead and make quick decisions and then drop down to actually particpate in the capturing of resources and objectives.StoryAlong with the great gameplay already mentioned, I (As a fan of wonderful RPG storylines) was actually shocked at such a great story and world Double Fine managed to create. While the story starts off rather slow in the first 1/3 of the game, it quickly picks up like ripping the training wheels off a kids bike while they decide to enjoy the nice weather.SoundtrackEven better, Double Fine has managed to create one of (In my opinion) the BEST soundtracks to date of any game I have played that does not compose its own music. Despite the music not being original, Double Fine has taken some of Metal's most iconic songs and integrated them into the game so well that it is impossible not to take notice of it. From the moment you take control of Eddie Riggs and Children of the Grave by Black Sabbath starts in the background only to start the main riff as Eddie pulls his battleaxe out of the ground and into the air.OverviewAll in all, this game may not be perfect for all players and that's okay. Tim Schaefer and Double Fine have always had a knack for making games tailored to a specific audience BUT if you happen to be a fan of Metal music or are looking for a game with an amazing world to explore and story to be told, this is your gig.ScoreApphazards's Score:8.8/10Price/Play Ratio:~2.4($15/~35hours)(Price/Play Ratio includes time invested in x360/ps3 versions)"

The story and characterization is decent, though nothing to write home about.The gameplay though is different. The main element is the RTS: and you can imagine an RTS built for consoles, even as someone who doesn't play many.Building comes down to one solitary command center where you build all your units, and ""fan booths"" that you destroy and build at specific points for resources.There are a total of maybe 8 units, which boil down to ""strong against infantry, strong against vehicles, strong against buildings"" along with their own type. Oh yeah I guess there's a stealth and a healing unit too.You play a ""hero"" who can fight, but also fly over the battlefield. Commands are done by placing a beacon with mouse3, then flying over to the general units you want to command and choosing attack, defend, go to or follow me. Special events like boosting troops, setting a rally marker or an area attack takes a 3-5 second guitar solo by one of three buttons in the order shown onscreen ala a very easy guitar hero.Overall not very deep or engaging gameplay wise, and the rest is alright. Even then the campaign is a measly 8 hours, with the few lost skirmishes and couple of side quests I did. It really does feel more like Jack Black's thing than Tim Schaefers. Maybe the multiplayer is different: seems DoubleFine are really interested in improving it. I mean I don't regret the $15 spent, but still it's just not that good.Final verdict: at least I got a hat out of it."

While the strategy and rpg aspects of the game are interesting neither aspect is done really well and end up feeling more box standard then innovative. However, the plot, setting, soundtrack, and character are the exact opposite as they perfectly play into the games metal theme. Creating the most enjoyable/funniest story based game I have played in a while.

For someone can be negative the graphics, but what the hell, art and style fits this game perfectly!Whole game looks like metalhead's wet dream with awesome cameos (you'll know them in moment you see them).

On one hand it is an open world action game similar to GTA (cruising around, finding missions, doing missions), just a lot more empty, which is kind of disappointing (But the landscape is full of references to metal bands and album covers which is pretty awesome). But the fighting and driving around is pretty cool. There are collectibles and some repeating mini games like fighting off a horde of enemies or racing, which give currency which you can spend at the Guardian of Metal to upgrade your weapons, your hot rod and customize Eddie. And of course there are the story missions.Later in the game, a strategy game part is added. You fight an enemy team and the goal is to destroy the enemy's stage (base). You have to collect Fans (resources) to build your troups which you can lead against enemy troops and ultimately to the stage. While the game unfolds you get a larger variety of troops and the battles get more difficult, but I never found them that much fun. Something was just lacking, probably the lack of strategic depth, since just spamming troops will usually lead to a victory. There is also a multiplayer part consisting of that mode, however I haven't played that.The graphics are not the best ever, but the comic-y style works and the goofy character looks just match the style of the game.Over all, as I said in the beginning, I 100% recommend this game to any Heavy Metal fan, for gameplay fans I can't really recommend it to anyone, since it's not a great specimen for any genres it tries to fit in. I still recommend it for the story and the characters."

The fact that there are elements of RTS, racing and 3rd person action all blended together left a lot of people scratching their heads when this was first released on consoles and wondering why it couldn't just be one of them. And that spoiled the game for a lot of people.However, setting aside all the seeming conflicts with all the different gameplay styles that have been melded together here, the game itself is simply brilliant. From the sometimes campy heavy metal stereotypes & cliches, to the designs for the demon enemies and even the choice of voice actors (some of which are true heavy metal legends and all-time rock icons like Ozzy Osborne and Lita Ford) everything comes together as an unabased tribute to a genre of music that, as one song found in the game says, can't be killed."

With metalhead main characters. With glam and emo style enemies. With guitar solos as abilities. And a hilarious story on top.Gameplay is ok. It is a combination of gamepad-oriented action (Darksiders) and minion-control strategy (Overlord). Not my favourites, but the game manages to deliver the variety and doesn't cause frustration. Collectibles unlock songs, as do missions.A pity, but Soundtrack Edition doesn't include any of the licensed stuff. It's only 20 original tracks recorded for the game.

At full price, it's worth every penny.  I'm not much of a heavy metal fan, but nothing has ever brought me so close to being one!  Just imagine being INSIDE a 1970's Ozzy Osborne or a 1980's Dio album cover.  Its a weird mesh, but the epic story they weave transports you convincingly into a world of lush ecosystems laced with ancient stone guitar and sword monuments, chrome car part forests, liquid metal volcanoes, towering fortresses with chains that extend into the sky, metalic spider webs, wandering demons and cyborg, fire-breathing beasts, enormous skeleton remains and a kick-a$$ soundtrack thats a who's who of the history of heavy metal.  The open world is seemless and feels expansive in your nitro boosted hot rod and they give you plenty of reasons to explore the countryside and actually WANT to pursue side quests.  Perhaps best of all, everything the game seems to lead up to from the beginning only turns out to be the first part of the story and twist upon twist unfolds to deliver a full gaming experience that does not disappoint.  I've never made this comparison before, but it felt like The Ocarina of Time formula in a bloody, head-banging package with less puzzles and more group combat that even gives a feel of real-time strategy during the more epic battles.  This is the game that Jack Black was born to give us.  Flawless!"

Jack Black for me is always entertaining no matter what he seems to do. Along with the fact that this game has a lot of Heavy Metal ""GODS"", and if you enjoy metal you'll definitely enjoy this game. Might be just myself but the whole campaign is roughly 8-10 depending on the speed at which you play the game. Easily though you can rack up 20 hours on this game doing all the achievements and side missions so many things to do in this game. The story is strange but fun don't take it too serious  and just let it do its' thing. There are a lot of power ups during the campaign but I found myself not really using any of them I guess just because there is relatively no need for them, but fun to play with. A lot of this game sadly is repetition doing the same missions over and over again gets dull but the story does keep the momentum flowing. Now for some of the bigger battles you have a tower defense sort of game these can be fun but tactile. Some problems was at times I found myself a little confused and not really sure what to do to keep progressing through the game. Overall this game is underrated for me it's a 8/10 jack blacks"

In no particular order it has elements of: hack and slash, driving/racing, and RTS, all set in a large open world.If Brutal Legend isn't quite sure what type of game it wants to be it is absolutely clear about what it is thematically, which is a glorious, unabashed tribute to heavy metal.  To really drive this home it is helpful to just present a list.Player-protagonist - Eddie Riggs - voiced by and modelled on Jack BlackAlly (field medic) - The Kill Master - voiced by and modelled on Lemmy KilmisterAlly - The Fire Baron - voiced by and modelled on Rob HalfordAlly - Rima - voiced by Lita Ford, modelled on KISSSide character (tunes up your car) - The Guardian of Metal - voiced by and modelled on Ozzy OsbourneEnemy - General Lionwhyte - voiced by Rob Halford, modelled on David BowieIn addition the guitar solos Eddie plays were recorded by Glenn Tipton and K.K. Downing, and the soundtrack consists 107 excellent and hugely varied heavy metal tracks (see wikipedia for the full list).If that list sounds like a dream come true, then this game is probably for you.  If you don't know who the people on that list are, then you might want to look elsewhere.Presuming that you fall into the former category, then if you find this game on sale I would suggest it is worth getting just to drive around in the car and listen to the songs on the radio.  The songlist includes several quite obscure older bands and is immensely broad so you might well discover some 'new' bands through this game - certainly I did.  Though be warned that in some cases getting hold of their music can be quite difficult.  I've had the game for several years and I'm still slowly reconstructing the song list.The gameplay is generally decent, certainly the lack of loading screens anywhere is pretty impressive, though the shifts between styles can seem a little odd at times.  The camera can be a bit finicky at times, which can be annoying if you are trying to enjoy the heavy metal scenery!  If you ignore the metal aspects then Brutal Legend is honestly pretty mediocre, it isn't bad certainly, but is also not exceptional.  It is however the most metal game you will ever play, and that is, if you are a metalhead, more than enough to make up for any deficits."

Tim Curry is effectively playing Satan again, so that's pretty awesome and the main protagonist is a Roadie played by Jack Black. The game nods to Metal in so many ways.From what I can remember, the controls were not the greatest and no Iron Maiden.

,Recommended,225260,19747887,"Posted: 17 December, 2015",all,db0ssman,"Negative:1. The game does a poor job of establishing information before the big reveals. This means that characters' behaviors can feel disconnected from what we actually know about the world and the game will make references to events the player only learns about later. Often character motivations, feelings, backstories or intentions aren't mentioned until right before or after major plot points are revealed which greatly diminishes any possible emotional impact of the discovery and makes the plot feel contrived and arbitrary.2. The game uses a lot of mechanics from different genres which makes it feel very unfocused. One moment you are playing a driving game, then it is a hack and slash and then its main story mechanic is some kind of MOBA/RTS. Nothing is done very poorly but nothing is perfect either.  Mechanically the driving is functional, but there is no map or quick travel and most of sections of the world are intersecting circular paths which means if you are trying to drive between worlds it is easy to miss that one random offshoot that moves to the next section of the world and you can spend a long time hunting for it. The RTS elements are still introduced even as you fight the final bosses which makes it so that you never really get that feeling of having mastered the system, which is usually the payoff you feel at the end of a game.Positive:1. The world is absolutely beautiful. The aesthetics of each section are unique, interesting and compelling. The music in the game is fantastic and there are over 100 songs to unlock and listen to. I spent a long time just driving around looking at all the scenery and listening to some great music.Overall ImpressionI'd recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of metal and anyone who likes to explore games with interesting art styles. If you are looking for a game with a gripping narrative and solid mechanics, I'd look for a different game.  In my opinion most gamers will probably not play more than 15 to 20 hours, as the side quests and object hunting is not really that compelling, let alone worth redoing multiple times. If you are on the fence, purchase the game at the next steam sale, but otherwise this game is easily worth the $10 to $20 it normally sells for.TLDR: Contrived feeling story. Unfulfilling gameplay. Beautiful world. Amazing music. Good 15 to 20 hour experience for fans of artistic worlds or metal music."

Now it's on Steam so I can play it again!Ok, one question:  are you a fan of heavy metal music?  If not, don't play this or it will make your ears bleed.The good:scenery, story, combat when you fight using your axe and guitar, big air ramps you ""accidentally"" jump with your hotrod.The great:music, voice acting, creative character designs, world design & variety of hidden stuff.The almost - but not quite - good:army combat where you give orders to your troops and capture/defend a fortress based on a concert stage.  Thankfully there are only a few of these that are necessary to advance the story.  Also, driving physics for your hotrod.Big talent went into the soundtrack and voice cast for this game.  Yes that is Jack Black as the Roadie from Another World, aka Eddie Riggs.  And the Prince of Darkness himself - Ozzy - as the shopkeeper.  The scenery is also pretty nice, sort of an epic metal fantasy world setting.  Demons and humans living side by side, struggling for dominance.  Just keep in mind this game was released very early during the Xbox 360's lifetime so don't expect it to look as good as Skyrim.It is an open-world (ish) RPG.  You can explore most of the world right after your tutorial mission.  More of it will open as you progress the main story.  You also will unlock more abilities and attacks by progressing the story, and some can be found buried around the world.  Plus there are some fun challenges for you to complete for achievements, like freeing all the chained serpents, looking through all the telescopes, and carving your own metal version of Mt Rushmore.For much of the game, you will be running or driving around a fairly expansive world, seeing what sort of hidden goodies you can find (there are tons of hidden things here) and trying to earn enough points to buy new upgrades for your weapons and your hot rod.  There are also points where your army will battle an enemy army with you in command as a general.  You have the option to run in and fight alongside your troops, but the main point of these is to use various battle commands to let your soldiers do the work for you.  You have to manage resources because each battlefield has a limited number of fountains that produce a sort of currency for you to build more soldiers and a couple of structures for your army.  Controlling and defending these fountains is the key to victory.  Once you have troops available, they will sometimes be found out on patrol in the wilderness.  If you find a group of troops, you can take command and they will follow you and fend off any enemies for a while.  In addition to various humans and demons, there are some wild animals running around.  Some of these are big enough to ride on.  Some are small but you can stun them and then pick them up and toss them like a grenade.  Try riding the warthog/motorcycle things.  Fast and fun!This game is longer than most other games by DoubleFine; it's sort of their flagship title.  There is enough here to keep you busy for a few days, maybe two weeks if you only play a couple of hours per day.  It also supposedly has a multiplayer feature to pit your armies against the armies of your friends (or the computer AI) but I have not tried it on this version of the game and on the 360 I only played a few rounds against the computer so I won't comment on that aspect."

,Recommended,225260,6550989,"Posted: 12 May, 2013",all,RCMetalhead101,"Brutal Legend offers a unique mix of a Hack & Slash Action/Adventure game with elements of RTS (Real Time Strategy) being introduced constantly throughout the game. The biggest appeal (and possibly turn-off for certain people) will be its strong metalhead culture in the world of Brutal Legend. The game offers so many jokes based on Metal music and takes many of the cliches and stereotypes of metal and embraces them with pride throughout the game.Music: The game offers many different genres of Metal throughout the entire game, from Heavy Metal (such as Judas Priest, Black Sabbath, and Motorhead), Power Metal (Manowar, Dragonforce), Thrash Metal (Slayer, Coroner, Megadeth, Anthrax), Black Metal (Dimmu Borgir, Emperor , Rotting Christ, Dark Fortress), Melodic Death Metal (Children of Bodom, Dark Tranquillity, In Flames, Carcass), and many other different sub genres of Metal. The game embraces the strong metalhead culture during the 70's and 80's. This is honestly the game's strongest aspect. 10/10Gameplay (Action & RTS): Unfortunately, the gameplay felt pretty limited in both Hack & Slash Action and in the RTS aspect. Thought not bad at all, many elements in both could have been much better. For the Hack & Slash Action, there were very few combos, even if you unlocked all of the combos. This wouldn't have been much of a problem if there were different weapons to choose from, but you only have the axe and the guitar from the very beginning throughout the entire game. Though you can choose upgrades for the Axe and Guitar, you'll catch yourself using the same combos over and over again throughout the game. The RTS felt the most limited, as it felt more like a Tower Defense. Defend your stage while summoning troops to attack the gate, other stage, or whatever base the other commander has. A decent amount of troops to choose from, but aside from that, there's not much except telling them to attack, defend, stay put, or advance. 7/10Adventure/Open-World: A good sized map overall with many different areas to explore and see, but unfortunately, there isn't much to do in these areas except completing the few different side quests and searching the area for secret collectables. 6/10Story: What started off as a sarcastic, light-hearted story, turns into a more darker, more serious story while still containing its humor. The story is pretty interesting at first but then starts to really grab you in once you defeat General Lyonwhite and meet the Drowning Doom (both are factions that you come across in the game), and it also contains many twists and turns once you reach this section of the game. 9/10Overall, a good game that I would recommend to anyone that loves Metal music, likes a good story with a few twists, and likes a decently good action and decently good RTS game.8/10 - A good game."

That's not asking for much, right?The enemies were really cool to fight because, like the characters, they weren't all the same, there were many different versions and iterations of the normal enemies as well as very different enemies in the last half of the game. They all reacted differently to your attacks and had different effects on you.When I made that salad reference in the bullet list, you'll probably get like, wait, what, it was good but it wasn't? (SPOILERS START HERE)Think Orpheus from Greek Mythology. No, really, think about him and then think about the game's story. I'm not saying it was the same, but it was a creative twist to his story. Eddie realized that Ophelia had betrayed them (but really, she didn't) and left her behind. Now, wasn't it like, I don't know, less than a half an hour ago that Eddie ""trusted her"" with his mother's necklace? That's really kind of slapdash when you think about it. It's like Tim just sat down and said ""Hey, we want to make them feel at this dramatic moment here, what do we do here, right before that moment?"" It wasn't a bad way to do it, more like too soon, so it didn't leave much of an impact on me. It's like this: which lego tower is going to have more broken pieces, the tall stack you've been building for the past ten hours or the small stack you threw together ten minutes ago? The ending felt a lot like this too. You've just fought and nearly killed Ophelia, but let her live because you still have feelings for her. (Really? I'd think you'd be shooting for Lita by now, Ed.) So now let's go and kill this evil Emperor- wait, he's not the Emperor? That's right, YOU'RE the Emperor. Technically. By birthright. Now that Doviculus is dead by thine Emperor birthright might and DECAPITATIOOOOOOOON, let's go drive the uglies out of town while Children of the Grave plays. Or... let's not?(SPOILERS END HERE)That being said, the story's still pretty cool if you can get past that, or maybe that's just because I grew up rereading Orpheus's story in a greek mythology book when I was younger. If the ending and feels-building were stretched a little longer, the story would be a lot better.And also sexy nun things. When I get a better computer, I'm gonna replay the game and see those sexy nuns in HD and not a mess of pixels.So do I recommend this?Yes and no.The metal in this game isn't like death metal or screaming or what-not, it's legit Ozzy Osbourne and Three Inches of Blood-grade metal. In other words, amazing-grade metal. The story, as I said before, is a perfectly dressed salad, complete with onions, hidden valley ranch, grape spritzer, all of that, but it was put into a plastic container and tossed quickly. The characters and enemies are diverse and rich, and there's also Jack Black. Yuri Lowenthal voices one of the second half game enemies too, so that's cool too.Get this game? Hell yes, support Double-Fine and let's coerce a sequel out of them, which approximately costs $30mil. So get to spending, folks. Tim Schafer can do much better, and he will."

The music suits the settings.  Watch and observe the people you meet, the creatures you see.It's a very well crafted game with a lot of thought put into so many of the gameplay aspects, even down to the intro and start menu itself.  It's in all the minor details you'll observe and in little nuts and bolts and larger elements too.Personally I'm not a fan of the 'fan system' of some battles but I got through it, that didn't take away from the enjoyment.Definitely try this if you want something different - it's nice and easy with humor.

It delivers you a unique story line which is based around music -really good type- and between melting facec with your high powered metal you can still slash enemies with your axe. The story is nice but after a point it feels repetitive. The game is mostly going around you shrecking people or you commanding your army to shreck people. I didn't get a defeat in quests more than 3-4 times which is actually a bad number. I played this game for about 10 hours and if you're not going to try to get 100% achi. I don't think you'll not play for more than 11-12 hours.In the end my opinion is, if you like metal music and comedy based strategy-hack'n slash games -while in discount- you should get this game.

Enter a world based on the mythology of metal - demons, beasts, flowing hair, and music that reshapes reality. The most notable thing about BL is its world design. Few games have this level of creativity on display in every inch of every piece of their world. It's in the characters and the archetypes they play with, the use of guitar solos and chord progressions to cast magic, the monsters that are half-vehicle/half nightmare beast, and the landscape itself, with its ancient statues of fists and guitars, chrome-tipped trees, Beerhenge, and cracked freeways. The way the Double Fine team has taken all the most fun and fist-pumping elements of classic metal and rock music and infused them into every square inch of this game made it feel unique and refreshing. I left the game wishing I could keep playing more in this world, seeing the characters continue to grow and keep on rocking.The gameplay is simple but engaging; a light action/adventure style with a lot of axe-swinging and guitar playing. You'll spend as much time in your hot-rod ""The Deuce"" as you will on foot, and that's a mixed bag. Controlling the car can be pretty squirrely, and it'll be a while before you're doing more than careening uncontrollably from one rock outcropping to the next. Once you get the hang of it, driving can be pretty fun - the landscape is designed for your car, and filled with ramps to jump, twisting roads to navigate, and critters to splat.It's an adventure game through-and-through, but occasionally BL tries its hand at RTS gameplay. You're a roadie trying to turn ragtag freedom fighters into a genuine rebellion army, and at certain points you will get to lead that army into battle. It's... another mixed bag, honestly. There's a lot that's good about it; giving orders works pretty well and easily, and watching all these troops you've freed and brought to your cause charge into the fray lends a weight to the story and your actions throughout. But years of games like Starcraft and the like have conditioned me to expect a top-down view that allows me a wide survey of the battlefield. BL sticks with its third-person view during the big battles, and it can sometimes be hard to tell where the enemy is and whay they're doing beyond a vague directional guide. I kept wanting more fine control than I had, and to be able to see more than I could.Further complicating the RTS sections, I rarely knew just what my objectives were. Eventually, tips would start popping up, but they're easy to miss if you aren't looking for them. More than a couple times I spent a long time waiting around in the big battles waiting for something to happen, not realizing I had to do some specific thing. Several of these times, the battle would suddenly end in victory and I had no idea how I'd won. These segments add gravitas to the game, but they never quite stand up to the level I wanted, and I'm left unsure how I felt about them.What sold BL to me and really brought out the fun were the cast of characters and the performance of their actors. Jack Black is an endlessly entertaining guy, and in BL he's paired with Jennifer Hale as the female lead. It's worth the pricetag on this game just to watch JB and FemShep lead a metal army against demons and hair-rockers. Guest appearances from Ozzy Ozbourne, Lemmy Killmeister, and Rob Halford buoy the rock cred, and are really entertaining. Lita Ford isn't quite as adept in her small part, but the performance of Tim Curry as the demonic Emperor Doviculus is as operatically theatrical as you could possibly want.I loved almost every moment of playing this game. I enjoyed the story, I enjoyed exploring the world, and once I could get my head and hands wrapped around controlling the Deuce, I even enjoyed driving across the countryside like a bat out of hell. Brutal Legend comes highly recommended from me, an overlooked gem that will leave you wishing for more."

You can tell what the entirety of the game is going to be like in the first minutes... or can you? Well, you can definitely guess the ending, which was kind of underwhelming, but it did start to feel like the game's dragging on. I really enjoyed the main character (Jack Black) and some quips others have said here and there (not really fond of the characters themselves though, except for that one sound guy and of course the Killmaster and the guardian of metal). I have two issues with the game: 1. The ""moba"" kind of gameplay wasn't really my thing, and fighting with your character doesn't seem complex - it's simple, just to carry the story and the world along. 2. The story started to take itself more seriously as time went on, or/and the main character did. It's not a major thing, but the story felt really simple for the majority of the game only to drop some weak ""twist"" at the end which flew completely over my head. There was a bit of name dropping of characters you never actually interacted with but are just there to provide some background to the story, so I didn't really get it. I guess I'm stupid, or I wasn't paying attention. But to be honest it doesn't matter, since the game FEELS simple and enjoyable at it's own expense, so your own level of involvement in the story shouldn't impact the experience much.Also it's open world though it doesn't feel like it has to be. It doesn't stand in the way or deter the experience, on the contrary it might add to it - I however just focused on the main story line and finished it in about 5+ hours.So overall a really fun game if you enjoy metal, though being a ""metalhead"" is definitely not mandatory to it. If you're at all familiar with metal music and don't dislike it or hate it, then you'll like it.(Similarly if you've watched the anime ""Detroit Metal City"" and enjoyed it, then you will definitely enjoy this game's world and characters or at least 3 of them.)"

The humour thoughout is brilliant (speaking as a heavy metal fan- because many of the jokes could go unnoticed by non-metalheads)...I love the tongue in cheek metal references and the overall light hearted tone- even though it can be a little gruesome at times. (The introductory cutscenes were fantastic in how they allowed you to choose whether you wanted to hear coarse language and then see gore as well)! The voices are great and cameos are very well done (Just met the Rob Halford inspired character).The fighting mechanics can be a little repetitive and I am really not a fan of real time strategy directing a battlefield (sending troops here and there), but the game is still fun and good value. Give it a go!* Update *I've had a break from the game for a while, partially due to getting frustrated by the strategy elements of the game, but having had another go, I totally remember why I wrote such a glowing review. It's awesome!!!If you're patient with the real time strategy battles, just getting involved and doing team-up attacks can be heaps of fun. Once again I recommend Brutal Legend.

Big open world.  Starring role for Jack Black.  Cameos from Ozzy Osbourne and Lemmy amongst others.My music allegiance is more hair metal (Guns N' Roses, Aerosmith, Bon Jovi) who are actually the bad guys in the game (the genre, not the bands) than heavy metal so the soundtrack isn't my core music taste.  Good to have your boundaries expanded though.I found the controls workable albeit the boss battles can be exhaustingly long - the game does give you tips if you're at stalemate for too long.There's a not entirely obvious (okay it's on the map) place to do upgrades which are fairly essential - I just upgraded my car to machine guns at a time just before a mission that needed them.  There's a set of extra missions just below the area on your map that becomes your base that seem to be screened off by as yet uncrossable terrain.Difficulty on ""Normal"" seemed okay - I'm having difficulty with an escort mission ATM however.But there are BIG problems.1)  The Devs have given the bad guys identical troops to your troops - just the clothes are different.  So in a battle it's really difficult to tell who are your side and who are the attackers.2) Four years (at least) after a problem with the save game feature was noted it STILL isn't working.  There is a solution but it involves accessing the game folders and copying over a file.  I've recopied the solution into the game forum so you can find it there if you need it.There are more minor problems too.  There's a relatively big open world but not a lot in it.  Combat is acceptable rather than inspiring.  Most of the main good guys smoke (a lot) including the main protagonist Eddie.  Smoking may look cool but being broke, smelling awful, and dying of emphysema at a young age are not.It's one of those games where price point plays a huge part in the review.  At £30 - £40 or even higher I'd have been VERY disappointed in the game.  At £15 - £20 the games problems would have seriously irked me.  But for a couple of quid it's an awful lot of game for your money, some serious star power, an offbeat if not exactly subtle sense of humour (what do you expect from heavy metal ?) and a worthy addition to your Steam library.S.x."

The soundtrack is pure metal, the theme and environment is all metal and gothic inspired. The story and dialogue is pretty funny with the main character voiced by and based off of Jack Black. It is an open world game of which you will spend a good amount of time in your car to get around. Side missions are a bit repetitive asking for either defend a group and kill the enemy, signal a mortar, go kill certain beasts, or race this irish fishman. The main mission incorporates multiple missions that are interesting in that it plays out as a tug of war style game where you have to convert spirit piles to your side to build up your fan count which you in turn spend on units and try to take out the enemy stage while protecting your own. I found this concept entertaining, but those who don't may not like the game all that much.The combat is basically hack and slash, pressing different combinations of your mouse buttons or utilizing guitar solo's for power ups and abilities. There are a decent amount of upgrades and and purchases so you can customize your weapons to some extent and your looks.Overall it is a very fun playthrough, very little issues past how annoying it can be to do the races and your car gets knocked off course by the racer or because of a tiny bump. The cutscenes are a bit derpy on visuals and voice sync but nothing bad. When the gothic scenary and enemies come in, that for me was the most enjoyable. Would love to see another version of this game, perhaps using techno or any electronic music.Personal experience score: 9.5/10Story: 9/10 - It was actually interesting and different considering everything revolves around the heavy metal environment. It wasn't epic but had a good amount of humor.Sound: 11/10 - Amazing soundtrack from top artists in the heavy metal industry. Cutscenes have some strange sound though that shouldn't be thereGraphics: 7/10 - A bit outdated and basic even for 2013. The cutscenes have some derpy animation and voice out of sync.Controls: 9/10 - Great overall, driving the car in the races is probably the only fault with the controls as it feels hard to maneuverGame Length: 5/10 - Short unfortunately, around 20 hours if you really get into the exploration. Otherwise it will be more around 13."

Very, odd, the headbanger npc starts to get very stupid but if you like rock and roll youll at least have a few hours of good entertainment before it gets to you."

I literally facepalm for several reasons.Anyway,9/10 would play again to complete some achievements."
