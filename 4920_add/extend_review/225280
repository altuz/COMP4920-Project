,Recommended,225280,9809017,"Posted: 13 April, 2014",all,SickBoy,"*Review edited for release... still nothing but good things to say about it!*There is tons more I could say about this game and how much I enjoy it than what is in this review, so free to message me on Steam if you have any questions. I highly recommend this game if you're looking for something new in your roguelike/dungeon-crawling experiences... it was *the* most polished Early Access Alpha I had ever played, and is even better now that it is released.GraphicsVery nice and consistently styled, even in the character screen. The choice in what a friend of mine put as ""playful yet macabre"" is spot-on, and a very nice change of pace from other roguelikes (not that those are bad, but FMR is a unique breath of fresh air).SoundEverything from the music to the effects is lovely and fitting to the visual theme. Moody, atmospheric, ethereal, magical, mysterious, spooky... that is what comes to mind while playing and it's a joy to listen to! Some of the tracks really remind me of the greatness that was the soundtrack for Psychonauts (my favorite game of all-time).ControlsSmooth and intuitive when using the keyboard+mouse (controls are customizeable as well, so you can play however you want). I don't play games this twitch-reliant with a controller, but feedback about it in general has been very positive.GameplayThe randomization, pin/item/relic/Loa/leveling ""build"" system works really well but isn't so random that you're screwed if you get bad drops. Since your core setup is however you want to do it (and very easy to experiment with), there is enough consistency to do theorycraft and gameplay mastery... a *very* nice change from the *completely* random roguelikes. I love randomization, but it's nice to have something to play that is a good mix of random and static.The variety in gameplay is great, giving a pleasurable dose of strategic fighting and completely chaotic shmup-style play. Because FMR has this kind of variety, you never really get sick of it. Just when you're tired of one style, you roll a level that's totally different. I'm over 125 hours into it as of this writing, and I'm still not even close to be tired of any of it.Progression is incredibly satisfying, but I'll speak more to that below.GenreWhile the game is most commonly categorized as a roguelike (or rogue-lite), I see it as a mix of roguelike, bullet-hell/shmup, and dungeon-crawler. It's a fantastic mix, and adds a ton to the scale and variety of traditional roguelikes.DifficultySome may find their intital play sessions to be too easy, but the difficulty curve is not even remotely a cakewalk later on. If you feel it's too easy, just keep playing...  later difficulties/quests are *much* harder and varied. You'll soon find yourself cursing (joyfully) at failed runs. Because of this, I do *not* consider this game a rogue-lite... if anything, it's just one that isn't ultra hardcore in the start and eases you into the insanity. A perfect game to introduce someone to the genre, but has enough hardcore craziness to keep even the most experienced of players happy.Difficulty in this game is where the real progression and satisfaction resides. Leveling/etc. is a nice way to ease the player into the various mechanics of the game, but the meat of it all is in the variety of difficulties you unlock. Don't expect to be carrot-and-sticked the entire time with pointless leveling and unlocks... instead, expect to get your satisfaction from mastering incredibly difficult situations that (in the later difficulties especially) require perfected playing skills.ContentLevel modifiers, difficulties, level palletes, mission objectives, mobs (and their variations), bosses, items, Loas, etc. all have a great amount of variety already, and further post-release patches are planned which is just icing on the already delicious cake. I was already very happy with the content amount in the early alpha, and that has far more than doubled between then and release. Because of the amount there is, and because of how it's sectioned out between the different quests, you always have a ton of choice depending on your mood and a helluva lot to experience, master, and be surprised by.A quick note: I am in the credits for the game for the QA work I was voluntarily doing (a nice surprise, so thank you devs!). I am not a developer or paid contractor for this game and have no bias in that regards... I just love testing, and the community was silent during a time when they really needed feedback so I stepped up. My review would be exactly the same even if I hadn't done testing for it."

,Recommended,225280,10690507,"Posted: 22 June, 2014",all,James,"FMR is a must grab on Steams summer sale, and here is my review on why.Over the Top Games is the independent game development studio( w/5 game developers) behind the multi-award winning NyxQuest. Founded in 2008 and based in Madrid - Spain. FMR was released on May 8th, 2014. It has a Voodoo theme that works & characters are ""cute"". The game mechanics are solid and fluid. ( I used the 360 controller so can't give opinion on K & M ) I haven't had any crashes or lag issues at all. The development team is planning to release free content updates as well.The music is a nice horror/fun mix from the talented composer Alistair Lindsay, for thosse that don't know the name he has done games such as ~ Prison Architect, LostWinds, Roller Coaster Tycoon 3, and even helped with the Rare classic Jet Force Gemini.The game itself doesn't really hold a story ~ but buying this game I wasnt really looking for one. It's tagged as a rogue-like game but I find it a lot more forgiving than most true rogue-likes, as others have called it and I agree it's more rogue-lite. Don't let that discourage you if like games such as Binding of Issac ~ Rogue Legacy ~ Risk of Rain you'll find easy to understand gameplay with a fair amount of depth to it. Character progression & customization that you keep even after death. Boss encounters provide a fun challenge. Loads of items to find while running around. FMR has solid 3D graphic style, lighting & shadow effects all seemed solid.My rating for Full Mojo Rampage ~Graphics 5 of 5Music & sounds 4.5 of 5Multiplayer N/A ( but have heard good things.)Gameplay 4.7 of 5Overall score 4.7 and worth the buy!Thanks for taking the time to read my review, cheers!"

Each chapter takes your saved character (attack rate, health, speed and damage points) through each challenge with an empty backpack.  You have to see what magic tools you can find and if you can adapt to use them.  Each chapter has around 5 or 6 levels to pass.  You unlock pins and masks and stuff for your saved character.  The challenges are fun and a little silly, while the monsters are creative.  Just fun."

(It sort of reminds me of ""Medieval"" with ""SIR DANIEL FORTESQUE""! ahhh memories...)One thing that is interesting about Full Mojo Rampage in comparison to its close relative ""Binding of Isaac"", is that it allows you to level up outside of the dungeons and rooms, allowing you to increase HP, Atk Rate, Dmg, etc. In-Lobby between dying and starting over.I haven't even been able to play Multiplayer at this time, and look forward to it quite a bit.One thing I would LOVE to see in this game, is more character customizations such as asthetic armours, robes, feathers, mantles more masks etc. this would give me more reasons to replay, and search, ohhh which brings me to another point maybe more secret rooms or rare events.I think in general the game as is, is great and could easily be added to (maybe some DLC in the future?).It's definetly a great game!"
,Recommended,225280,10135037,"Posted: 15 May, 2014",all,[CZ]Skyblade799,"This game pleasantly suprised me.It plays similarly to games like binding of issac or nuclear throne, being a top down shooter with a large inclusion of roguelike elements.The gameplay involves doing a variety of differing quests in order to complete levels, while collecting items to make yourself more powerful. Some examples inclide destroying the summon pillars, collect x amount of items, and destroying waves of enemies quickly to weaken a boss. Combat is that of a twinstick shooter, focusing on movement while attacking surrounding enemies. Each level is procedually generated, and the player progresses over a world map aiming to reach the end through beating each stage. Death in the game without special items requires the player to start over in the chapter. In online co-op the players have a shared pool of 3 lives, but if that pool runs out, then they lose.There are various classes in game which each have their own unique abilities and rampage effects. The beginning class has dodging, a sort of fire mortar, and the rampage involves summoning an ally to your aid. Later examples include the ability to summon stationary totems to deal damage, or sacrificing ones own health to deal damage. The inclusion of the class abilities gives a reliable way to deal with challenges without having to worry about your luck being down, and gives the player a fairer chance to survive without item drop luck being a trouble(compared to other games of the type)The game includes more customization then just class though, also including various unlockable and upgradable pins which modify starting stats, many unlockable masks (for visual difference only), and a levelling system which gives minor stats through leveling. (Though this same leveling also is required to unlock use of the pins). The leveling so far hasn't seemed to imbalance the game, as it has remained difficult throughout. As well, it includes a variety of difficulty levels which unlock as you beat each chapter. Each difficulty level seems to add more hazards, as the one right after the normal difficulty makes enemies harder, whlist adding a chance for enemies to drop bombs after death (and there are about 3-5 more difficulties after that).There are many items in FMR, with a variety of upgrades, weapons, and consumables. There are about 12 weapons, each weapon with a unique projectile. Each weapon not only has the base projectile type such as a beam or a boomerang style poison cloud, but also includes randomly chosen bonuses, including extra projectiles, bonue damage, and extra charges. Though each weapon has a certain amount of ammo before it runs out, each weapon can be stored in the inventory for later use. All relics and inventory items can be swapped out for others at any time for other ones, though as well the player is limited to a max of 5 relics and 5 inventory items after obtaining upgrades (the player starts with base 2 relics and base 3 inventory).Relics (also known as mojo's) are the primary items for upgrading your character. Their effects vary from the base mojo giving base stat upgrades such as health, damage, crit chance, or a percent chance of a homing missle, to the unique mojo's which give larger bonuses as well as unique effects, such as heal on critical hit, or enemies summoning a black hole on death. The inventory can hold weapons, relics (for later use) and usable/consumable items. Usable items are more often one use only, but others have a timed recharge. The inventory items have a large variety, with such items as a temporary spread shot potion, a disco ball that distracts enemies, a pipe which summons an allied cannon or kamakazee pack, and a passive knife which permanently buffs you once you land the killing blow on four elite enemies.There are also coins for shop items and pin upgrades, and tokens for unlocking classes and masks. A feature which does bother me a little is the fact that coins are continuous between games, meaning that players can purchase all of the items they want after upgrading all of their pins, and don't have to worry about money like in games such as issac. I'd rather prefer that coins be added up into an upgrade bank after each run, but have each run start off with no money.Enemy variety is fairly big. Though each stage only has a certain amount of differing enemies, there are many stages to choose from, such as swamps, lava pits, caves, dungeons, and pipe ridden distilleries, each with different enemies. Each stage also features background secrets which grant items, and each stage has their own different looking secret (though a little more variety in the secrets for each stage would be appreciated). Not only is there a variety of base levels, but as you go through each chapter, a larger variety of quests and areas are given, and though the first chapter may lack in some variety in quests at first, progressing certainly causes the game to open up. The game also features boss encounters which do seem to change in some encounters, but since I've played some chapters more then otherss, I don't know which have changing encounters. Nonetheless, the bosses were challenging and fun, and each one functioned differently.Aside from the main levels, there are also side areas accesible from the map, such as shops, mojo mixers, shrines, and challenges, all with very different ways of functioning. The shops are what you would expect, allowing one to buy and sell items. The mojo mixer is a unique area of incredible value, which allows the player to combine two mojos (upgrade relics) into one upgrade, saving precious upgrade slots, and allowing one to equip more relics. The shrines have a variety of effects, some being purely positive, while others end up being more risk/reward. The possible effects of the shrine depend on the class the player chooses, and in online co-op, all of the different players classes are chosen from for the possible shrine effects. As well, in online co-op, shrine reward items are distributed depending on how many players there are, so that other players don't get left out. The challenges are varied as well, ranging from destroying a mini boss in someones nightmare, to fighting off enemy skeletons to defend friendly zombies.Right now there are only base 4 chapters, a survival mode, unlimited survival, and a generated daily quest (similar to spelunky). Each chapter is procedually generated in both the selected map layout, and the individual stages, and though I haven't yet tried it, I would assume the survival would include some sort of random elements as well. Though 4 chapters doesn't seem like a lot, they have taken quite a bit of time to get through, plus  I haven't yet tried variety of other difficulties, or the survival mode. As well, if you enjoy the leaderboard focused daily challenges in something like spelunky, then the daily challenge will likely interest you.I haven't tried the local co-op, so I cannot speak for whether or not it is very different from the online co-op, but the online co-op is a blast, though some of the mechanics may put some off. Players have a shared 3 life pool, and once a single player dies after they are all lost, the the run is lost. As well, players must revive eachother when they fall. A player can obtain other ways of revival, but there is no way to regain shared lives to my knowledge. Players must share items they come across, including weapons, upgrades, items, and coins. I personally like this fact, as it ecourages a team sharing of items to help with other players builds, but there are a few downsides. The inventory and relic upgrade slots at the time of typing cannot be dropped, and players can accidentally pick them up, even if they have reached the maximum for that slot type. As well, coins are not shared, and cannot be dropped.Overall, it's a wonderful game in my opinion. I absolutely reccomend it."

It reminds of Alien swarm.

(rogue legacy, ftl, magicite, etc(its easier than those games))You have only a few buttons to press but in no way do you feel lacking or without options. Its actually really well made. Characters are unique and eventhough upgrades and levels seem small (in fractions) they add up really fast, taking into account the style of play.Its original, lore wise (pretty cool and well researched voodoo background (though turned into something cheerful and funny lol))Its well made, responsive and intense. Levels are interesting and fit accordingly with whats expected from the player.its a 8/10 for sure. Definetly a game worth its price and garanteed action.

You have 4-5 slots to carry all these lovely things around at the begining, but there's even drops that increase your item slots allowing you to carry more power. not to mention a mojo mixer altar where you can combine 2 Mojo Badges into 1 while keeping all the stats in a purple epic glowThe game has perma death (eek!) but the xp, gold and medals collected during the game last through your demise, allowing you to purchase more skill points - you also level up and get stronger the more you play, there is an afterlife for stats so its a rogue-liteThe developers have added veriety everywhere. Chapter are differant from each other each containing its own unique level bioms and missions (some are straight up kill everything, some involve finding items, theres a death labrynth maze level + more. the level layout is randomly generated), There's no ordinary class selection. In the voodoo world your 'class' is determined by which diety you choose to follow. Each of these dieties called 'Loa's' have ugly faces and award you with two unique active spells and one special passive skill. each deity also randomly spawns a unqiue consumable drop for you during play (some heal u, some do damage etc), and instead of skill trees you have upgradable voodoo pins; of which there are a lot, but you can only carry 2 at the begining, but you're able to carry more as you level up (i think i have 4 pin slots at lvl 11). you can mix and match your Loa skills with either healer pins or dps pins or cc pins to see which works for which play styleThere's also a good variety of enemies to kill, and loads of stuff to find, upgrade and loot! The controls are tight (I use a xbox pad, its excellent for this), the soundtrack is fitting and the gameplay is difficult enough so that youll need to level up and replay each chapter few times before being able to beat it. The game is also very polished - running smooth since alpha, so smooth i forgot it wasnt released yet.A multiplayer mode was also added close to release - which i still havent tried, was determined to finish the single player first.all-in-all a charming indie shooter that oozes its own fresh voodoo character.

With a beam wand equipped, I pretty much vaporized a boss). On other occasions, you will only find garbage mojos(the standard equips in the game). This also goes with the boss fights because so far theyve been the similar spam-bouncy-attacks-in-a-small-room-and-jump/spin-all-over-the-place where a few rogue hits will finish you off if you didnt luck out and find potions on the way since not even the random shops can be relied on to get them because they often only sell wands and mojos.The monsters often spawn very close to you. In a game where a death means restarting at the beginning of the level and losing your accumulated mojos/buffs, having a suicide bomber appear and blow up in your face is simply silly.The multiplayer is a ghost town."

76561198045242590,Recommended,225280,8714497,"Posted: 15 January, 2014",all,Shatov,"Highly recommended. Overall great for an early access game.I haven't tried pvp game modes yet, so this review doesn't pertain to that at all.The main gameplay in FMR is probably best described as a bullet hell style top down shooter, with random rogue-like and rpg elements. The solo and coop game modes are quest based, of which there are currently (as of Alpha 5) 3 quests and 1 survival quest. The quests themselves are randomly generated sequences of random dungeon-like levels and bosses, with other random surprises mixed in. When starting a quest, one starts on a fresh character, so all items and equipment (called relics in FMR) are only kept during this quest. If one dies in the quest, they cannot continue onward and lose all items / relics found during that run. However, players get experience towards level-ups which remain throughout all quest runs, and there are certain stat increasing items called pins that also remain. In this way, many have described it in terms of similar games as a mixture of The Binding of Isaac gameplay with Rogue Legacy style leveling. In my experience so far, I would say the items found during a run are far more important than stat collections from pins and leveling up, so it leans a bit towards the rogue-like side. I'd say it has a nice balance.As for game performance, I have had zero issues in single player; the graphics look great and I have had no frame drops. There was slight lag in online multiplayer coop gameplay, but I think dedicated multiplayer servers are likely in store for a future FMR build, so that may improve. That being the only negative aspect I've yet to encounter, I give this game a thumbs up.Finally I should note the game development team is very active in the game forums, which is a plus.Overall, it is quite a lot of fun in its current state and will probably continue seeing great improvements during its development."

It's a rogue-lite, so it's forgiving when you die, since you unlock new power ups and stuff, as well as occasionally getting a level which will let you increase health, damage, move speed, or attack speed, with the option to respec using gold that you find while playing.There are items called Pins which you unlock by finding them in the game. You can then level them up using gold on the character select screen, which will add various bonuses and buffs  (Chance to slow enemies on hit, extra damage, etc.). Once you unlock a pin, it is permanent, but you can only have a few equipped at a time.You also unlock new Parent Moas, which act as a ""class"", using Medals, again found as you play the game. Each Parent Moa will give you 3 different abilities. One of them is based on a meter, which for some characters will give you an item once it fills, give you various bonuses as it fills, or can be consumed to make an attack stronger. The other 2 abitilities are Active ones, which have various purposes. Some are defensive, some are offensive, and some are supportive (Basically, only for co-op play, or else you're gonna have a bad time.)Along with those, there are one-time buffs which consume a combination of gold and medals. They will last for the entirety of a single quest line. So, basically until you die, quit the game, or beat the final boss of that mission.There are even different fetish masks which you can unlock. Some of them look dumb, some of them look awesome, all about personal preference. They don't give any special bonuses, all just for show.This game is very fun, and only $13. What kind of excuse do you have not to get it?There is just one thing I would love to see, but highly doubt it would be added, and that is some sort melee option, since every attack in the game is ranged."

76561197980107643,Recommended,225280,9011060,"Posted: 7 February, 2014",all,Flailsnail,"Full Mojo RampageFull Mojo Rampage is an odd little game. I say “little” but it is in fact quite vast. It’s still an in-development title, but what is present already would make for a full game in its own right very easily. Early access games usually give me a little bit of pause, but I took a chance on this one based on the art and gameplay style and thus far I have certainly not come away disappointed. Let’s jump right in shall we?To begin with, I’ll cover the art style. It’s dark, it’s adorable, and quite frankly it fits with the overall game exceedingly well. It has an eerie way of feeling cheerful yet depressing at the same time. It’s quite a feat to have pulled off. There’s not much else to be said other than that it is beautiful and makes the game that much more enjoyable to play.Now to the meats of the game! The delicious Voodoo filled meats. Full Mojo Rampage is a loot-filled monster crushing extravaganza. It’s a roguelike at heart and doesn’t apologize for that very often. It does make a few concessions here and there but it does little to detract from the overall difficulty level in the grand scheme of things. You play as a little Voodoo avatar with one of several Gods chosen that determines your power set. Differences between them are fairly substantial with some focusing on a support role while others bring out the damage dealing mage archetype in you. The game is designed to be played cooperatively with up to four people, so the variety and tactical options are very intriguing.At its heart, Full Mojo Rampage is an isometric dungeon runner. You accept a quest, the game randomly generates the world it takes place in, and you go about your merry way, Voodooing anything and everything standing in your path. Along the way you will collect one-shot items as well a gold that may be used for permanent items to boost your statistics. It’s a tried and true formula that holds up very well in the setting, with a couple of tweaks along the way. The first is that death is permanent. When you die, you are tossed back to the main menu and required to start anew. However, you do not have to start from scratch. Instead you retain your gold and experience and can use those to upgrade yourself or unlock a new God to attempt the quest with. It adds a considerable amount of replay value to the game. It may still be in early access, but the amount of content is still substantial and it will only get better as development continues.So is it worth your time and money? That’s a decision that’s on you, as always. If you have friends to play with or don’t mind random games on the internet, and you happen to enjoy the action-oriented gameplay, it’s easily worth the current asking price. However, if you intend to play it alone or you’re not into Diablo-like games, this one may be something to pass up. It’s possible single player, but not designed to be played in that fashion and may discourage you. Take a look, do some research on top of this review, and decide for yourself! Just keep the difficulty in mind and don’t be disappointed."

The gameplay is great, too -- many different elements (different locations, pins, mojos and consumables for loot, different rooms with various functionalities to visit, etc).  At first glance I loved the look and the music, and all the goofy/awesome looking masks, but the more I played with a friend, the more I appreciated the flow and the fun of the co-op play.  It's a very relaxing game, but not without a challenge, and it can get very hard on the higher difficulty.There's not much I don't like about this game, but if I were to change something, I'd change the cards (gods) -- they're a bit random, and there's too few of them (8 or so).  If there were like twenty more cards, that'd be so nice and would open up tons of new playstyles.  I think the idea of them is really good, just need more options since some of them are a bit lackluster.  Seeing how random some of them are, I don't see how you couldn't just add some more random ones, just for the choice of it (see if it suits some).To me, the replay value is pleasantly high, but I can see why people would think it can get a bit repetitive.  For the price though, it's more than worth it: the design, the unlockables, the gameplay -- it's all great for me.  I'm really happy this game was made, and is in my library for when I want to play with my friend."

I know it is part of what a roguelike is made of, but, again, only PART. For example: the only two skills you have at the beginning have such a long cooldown that most of my ingame time was spent wandering away form monsters, completely helpless, 'til I could try to hit them again.Maybe this is your thing and if all I'm saying sounds to you like ""diablo + dark souls...

It's not a terrible game, but the core gameplay suffers from some problems.Firstly, you get a fairly limited view of what's going on around you. Particularly when moving south I felt blind as to what I was walking into. Enemies with missile/charge attacks generally have a range of around half a screen, which sometimes means you are being attacked from offscreen, or you don't get to see the enemy telegraphing their charge so when it comes at you there's no time left to dodge.The levels are initially empty - you trigger enemy spawns as you explore. Most of them will run straight at you after their spawn animation, and except for the kamikaze types you can outrun them (by default; presumably if you put enough points in speed you can outrun kamikazes too).You can choose from a bunch of characters which have a variety of spells, but all have the same peashooter basic attack. You can't take many hits either, and all of this combines to encourage a conservative strategy:1. Tiptoe around level until enemies spawn2. Run away from enemies while shooting at them3. Remain in the already explored area of the level until they're all dead (to avoid spawning more enemies)4. Rinse and repeatUnfortunately none of this is very hard, or engaging. Nor could I find any other viable strategy; the limited dps means you need to progress through the level fairly slowly to manage enemies as they spawn, and your limited health pool means you need to keep your distance as you can't afford to take risks.It's a shame, because if it wasn't for these core issues it would be a lot of fun."

The game has both single player and multiplayer, and I only played the single player content so far. If you're a fan of roguelikes, then you would enjoy this game.The combat is relatively easy to learn. Mouse, WASD, E, and Space are all the controls this game uses. Left click is your attacks, right click and space are abilites (more on that later), E is to open chests, and WASD is to move. As you play, you gain experience, which allows you to level up, gaining extra power.You start with the following stats:200 Health (If this is zero, game over)15 Damage (Damage per shot fired)7 Movement speed (How fast you move)4 Fire Rate (The amount of shots fired per second)When you level up, you gain 40 health and choose one of the following:HEALTH: +20 Health, +3 DamageDAMAGE: +5 DamageMOVEMENT SPEED: +0.5 Movement Speed, +3 DamageFIRE RATE: +0.5 Fire Rate, +3 DamageAdditionally, there are pins and Moas. Pins are unlocked through coins, and you can equip them as soon as you reach level 2. You gain a pin slot every 2nd level (From what I gathered so far), and each one gives different bonuses. Pins can increase your base stats, give other benefits (Extra experience gain or an Extra Life), or chance to cause on hit effects such as fear and poison. Moas, however, are essentially the class system in the game. Though you start with one, other ones can be unlocked through Medals (Rare drop in the game, not real money), and each Moa has a different playstyle. For example, one has your health bar be your mojo bar (special bar), so you essentially start at hardly any health whatsoever. As you kill enemies, however, you gain mojo, thus increasing your health, and you also gain a higher chance to critically hit with your attacks, causing more damage. The abilities said Moa gives you are a teleport that places a dummy to taunt enemies and a Drain-all-your-health-for-allways-critical-hit-for-a-short-duration skill. There are others, but that's the only one I'm going to spoil.To top it all off, I've done a video showing off the game for anyone still debating about getting it.

It is composed of very gloomy blues, greens, dark reds, and purples for it's backgrounds, but pops with bright and electric colors on it's foreground. It feels very mystical, and is reminiscint of the environment in the Secret of Monkey Island. It plays almost like a twin-stick shoother, but with the core gameplay feeling like an ARPG, such as Diablo, or Torchlight. It also has an ALMOST perma-death, with levels and certain stats carrying over, but nothing else.You will die time and time again, but be excited to start over.

Essentially, it is a ""tongue-in-cheek"" Voodoo adventure RPG.  The graphics are well done and the gameplay can be very exciting, albeit a bit repetitive.  Price-wise, I am certainly pleased with my purchase and look forward to future updates.  My only suggestion would be a ""casual mode"" for those of us who aren't so coordinated.  After a while, the grind does become frustrating.  Neverthless I am pleased with this game and recommend it to others."
,Recommended,225280,14019631,"Posted: 16 January, 2015",all,THE KRAKEN,"I wasn’t sure quite what to expect with this one, but, I must say, I was quite pleased. It was easy to pick-up, fun to play, and an all around good time. Let’s get started.I – Story [8/10]Full Mojo Rampage is a top-down, roguelike dungeon crawler from Over the Top Games. While there is no set story per say, the game consists of a series of quests which you (a Voodoo priest) undertake to please various Loas. In the first quest, you’re helping Baron Samedi to close a number of portals he opened by accident while drunk. In the next, you are helping Maman Brigitte collect certain items to fix a shrine. And so on and so forth. It kept things interesting to have several story lines to play through instead of just one. That being said, the stories themselves were fairly basic and somewhat short.II – UI [8/10]The user interface was decent, though, at times, the inventory bar could cause some problems. For example, accidentally selling an item to a vendor that you had intended to keep. Apart from that, the UI was just fine. There was nothing else I could see that was problematic in the least.III – Gameplay [10/10]Full Mojo Rampage has a very interesting form of gameplay. The game does have perma-death and you have to die (or fully complete the quest all at once) in order to level up your character and increase their stats. Items and stat buffs do not carry over from quest to quest (but they do from mission to mission within quests) nor do they come with you in death. Each time you die, you’re starting over fresh and, hopefully, with better skills then you had in your previous life.As I stated above, your items and stat buffs do not come with you between quests or deaths. Each run presents you with an array of new possibilities as far as your inventory is concerned. While, at lower levels, this can be somewhat annoying if you die repeatedly, it gradually gets easier as you come to understand FMR’s mechanics better.FMR has a “class-based” character system. I use this term loosely because your character’s “class” depends entirely on which Parent Loa you choose for your current life. This will dictate what special abilities you have to use on your current run. And, naturally, some Loas are more useful than others.All in all, the gameplay makes for an enjoyable game experience and will keep you coming back for more.IV – Content [10/10]I was very satisfied with the amount of content that FMR gave me to play with in-game. There are a plethora of wands to pick up, each with their own attack power. There is also a smattering of Mojo items that buff your stats and make you more powerful. On top of this, there are also a great many usable items to help you in your quests as well. I also particularly enjoyed the amount of different enemies I was presented with for slaying/banishing purposes.As for character customization, the most you get are special pins that boost your stats and you can select your Voodoo mask. The masks offer no extra buffs, it’s purely for aesthetics, so whatever floats your boat goes.V – Visual [10/10]The graphics and artwork of FMR are some of the best I’ve seen lately. Everything was smooth and well done. The art was phenomenal. It reminded me strongly of art from Rare Ltd games (both past and present) with a darker twist on it.VI – Audio [8/10]The music throughout the game is fantastic. It was a solid soundtrack and really added to the whole atmosphere of the game.The sound effects were, for the most part, great as well. In death, all enemies sounded the same, and the lack of unique boss sounds was a little disappointing, but it didn’t do much to take away from anything else game-wise.VII – Overall [9/10]Overall, Full Mojo Rampage is a wonderful game. If I remember correctly, I got this one on a Steam Sale, but I would not have hesitated to pay full price. It’s good fun and and even more fun if you’re playing co-op with buddies."

The enemies are somewhat clearly advantaged and classed. It's hard to tell if any of the items you pick up really help. Nice way to burn twenty minutes on something brainless.

I'm still playing around with it so I haven't gotten to far.  I'd certainly recommend this game for RPG fans.

That's honestly the best way to experience this in my opinion, play it with a few friends and just get a laugh out of it.Updates have taken a breake at the moment but in the forums it was explained why and i think as soon as they get back to it the game will only get better.You shouldn't ignore this game though, get it, get it for a few friends if you have to, party in voodoo-style!"

You die a lot but get coins and medals to spend on pins (increase your skills) and different attacks and stuff. Not saving is a big part of the game. Kind of like Binding of Isaac with bigger levels. Unfortunately, after some Windows updates maybe, the game crashed on my computer and my 20+ hours of play was completely lost. Oh well. Still a really fun game. I play with a controller. The soundtrack is really good too. Even though I lost my progress, I still love the game.Ok so I wrote the above review about 15 minutes ago and now the game is so laggy and crashy that I can't play it anymore. The game doesn't always crash. It just slows down and makes like, broken computer noises. I still like the game but maybe my computer can't handle it anymore...."

This one kind of flew under the radar even though it came out at a time when theses kinds of games felt new and were receiving a lot of attention.Solid twin stick gameplay with permadeath,  random levels,  and persistent class unlocks and perk upgrades.  The persistent upgrades and unlocks help make death less frustrating but you don't feel like you're grinding for these upgrades or that the game can't be won without them.   Easy to learn controls plus enough special abilities to keep things interesting.  One unique touch not often seen in this kind of game is the map screen similar to super mario 3 where you choose the level you want to go to and avoid certain types of levels if you want.Excellent audio visual presentation with a unique voodoo theme.   A lot of indie games go for a retro pixel look or if they try for 3d end up looking cheap and stiff.   Everything looks very fluid in this and has a lot of personality.Like many roguelikes of any kind this is very difficult and so is something you can play for a long time.  It rarely gets overly frustrating though.  Because of the well done presentation and fun gameplay you won't mind replaying levels.   It even has multiplayer though I haven't tried it.Highly recommended and well worth the price."

I definitely think some enemies seemed to hit for a lot of damage, but it never seemed unfair, I just felt really bad at the game, which is probably true. I have only tried it briefly, but I enjoyed the time I spent playing and after my campaign to at least try every steam game in my library I will come back and try to experience everything this game has to offer. Easily one of the best games I picked up this steam sale."
