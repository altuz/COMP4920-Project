Story is alright but don't expect it to be in-your-face drama 24/7.  This is a game about fantastic atmosphere and you exploring the level.  Figuring out that one specific solution or finding that one specific item bring such a fantastic epiphany feeling when it happens.  This game is full of that.If you want stat grinding, a soap opera story, or a heavy combat focus, this isn't it.  If you want amazing level and puzzle design with matching quality atmosphere then you need to play this.The only possible downside is the usual adventure game trope of not knowing where to go occasionally.  Just go over the known areas you've been and keep searching, it doesn't take forever to find the way through."

A beautiful experience, even if I didn't always know what to do. Sure, it doesn't hold up anymore, but the graphics were beautiful and the gameplay outstanding. You really felt like an explorer. Lara Croft was one of the coolest things back then. Oh, how things have changed. After TRII it all pretty much went downhill.Until earlier this year, with the release of the Tomb Raider reboot. Lara was finally cool again. That's also the one game that you should play if you want to experience a Tomb Raider game. Not that this one is bad, it's just awfully dated. Play this one for the nostalgia.[Rating: 86/100]"

If she wants to be the first to reach it and prevent a catastrophic fate for the world, she will need to find the keys that will open the way... elsewhere than in China.I must say that Tomb Raider II isn't perhaps my favorite game in the series, as I'm heavily influenced by the first opus and Anniversary. But the story is well written too. I mean, who doesn't want to follow her under the water or in Italy or in Tibet?The gameplay is pretty much the same as the first game: you jump, you search levers, you move stuff and you shoot anything coming in your way. And Tomb Raider II has a major shift here: instead of the animals or the legendary creatures, your enemies are now humans. Many humans. Many crazy humans. And you're confronted to them more than the animals (true, you have sharks, dogs, even Yetis or spiders). I suppose that maybe, this shift may have contributed to the fact that I'm still clinging more to the first game.But this game is also introducting vehicles for Lara: boat (well in Venice) and the snow bike which I had the most fun with. This is great to take ramps, to jump over pits or to race against the clock. That's also one of the main changes. Another new thing is the fact that you have allies in the game in the form of Tibetan monks. Don't hurt them and they'll let you in peace.Tomb Raider II is also an improvement for Lara herself: she has more weapons (like an harpoon for example) if she needs to defend herself (and trust me, she will need them nearly all the time). But the best improvement is probably aethestic: she's looking more curvy than angular, though she's still wearing her regular outfit.However, during the game, now, Lara changes also clothes. While the change is perhaps minimal, it's more realistic for the levels. It's just a little disappointing that she must find her way on a platform in the middle of the sea, where it's very very industrial. But generally, the landscapes are still sticking to the ""Tomb Raider"", aka, historical places like the Great Wall of China or Venice but also more mysterious levels like a wreck of a cruiser or a Tibetan monastery. It's very nice done and guess what? The T-Rex makes also a cameo.Anyway, I liked a lot the soundtrack, mainly the one used with the snow bike for the first time.Tomb Raider II is a nice way to keep going with the series. Too bad, it doesn't come with the add-on The Golden Mask (more snowbiking!) but anyway, if you're nostalgic of putting the butler in the fridge, given the price and the regular promotion of -75%/-80%, you shouldn't hesitate."

There is a lot to explore as far as going across countries from China to Venice and more. You can find powerful guns hidden throughout the game to protect yourself from Marco's mercenaries. The sound effects and background music make it more intense as you push your way through the levels and discover what Marco is up to. I recommend this to any of my friends who have played the Tomb Raider series and those who have not. Excellent game!
76561198049105119,Recommended,225300,8896466,"Posted: 28 January, 2014",all,Amarysse,"My 10-year-old self and I can't recommend this game enough. It's classic puzzle-solving at its finest. In fact I'm pretty sure that playing it made me smarter. There's no AI holding your hand here, nor any obnoxious button graphics that flash on-screen and yell at you to mash the Y key to perform some entirely gimmicky and circumstantial roundhouse backflip to the face that you'll never need to do again. Just Lara and her lovably awkward polygons running straight ahead with the arms fully stretched out at a stiff, perpendicular angle to the body. On occasion, you can make her say ""No,"" in a charming British voice, over and over again, and then kill her in a variety of exciting ways.Serously though, the levels are rendered beautifully, leaving just the right amount to the imagination, and many of the puzzles actually require more than three brain cells to figure out. There are no journal entries offering fluff faux ""immersion,"" no toggled map overlays to tell you where you are, and very little clues to help you out - just you and an often convoluted and action-packed pathway from the start of a level to the exit. The levels themselves, especially the memorable Venice series, have personality and often make you feel real suspense and a sense of danger. While some puzzles might frustrate the modern gamer (certain ones depend on very exact placement of Lara to perform a series of jumps with no room for error, for instance, which can get pretty tedious), the feeling of accomplishment you get after finally landing that horrendous jump, or opening that goddamn door, is so worth the effort.In my opinion, this and the original Tomb Raider are the best installments in the series, mostly thanks to their simplicity. What it lacks in modern graphics, the game makes up for tenfold in gameplay and creativity of story and design. Plus, for the first time, Lara gets to use vehicles, which add a great deal of fun to the levels they appear in, by which I mean you can drive them off cliffs and explode.All in all, you won't regret giving this a try. Yeah, you'll probably laugh at Lara and make fun of the dated graphics, and swear loudly at the controls, but these days, that's part of the fun. Definitely a must for 90s action/adventure gaming fans and especially people who don't mind video games not insulting their intelligence for a change.Oh and you can lock the butler in the freezer."

When you are dropped off in China for the first time, the graphics may not be so impressive, but for a game from 1998, its pretty nice. Throughout the game, I only really had 2 problems. This game, compared to Tomb Raider I, is more fighting oriented and is ""overflowed' by the amounts of combat (Human-to-Human). In Tomb Raider I, you fought around 10 people, all of them being reoccuring characters in the storyline. My second problem was how excessively long the Shipwreck stages were. They should of decreased the amount of Shipwreck level, and should have added a new set of stages. 90/100. Gameplay 10/10. Graphics 9/10. Storyline 9/10.

Expensive computers in that era were only capable to play (NOT encode) two MP3 320kbit/s files in realtime and do nothing more. And TR2 creators did such a great 3D game with audio for those computers and overcame those limitations...I believe it was still the moment when great ideas were involved to make the game even more fun!I bought mine game with the TR Collection and I am satisfied.There is a level editor (TRLE) for TR2, available for free! There are many fan-made custom levels for TR2! Those levels are often provided as a full games ready-to-run, but when installing those maps into the Steam game you will get the TR2 music.For Geeks: You can also use the fly-patch as it is compatible with the Steam version and is NOT compatible with the version provided with many custom levels. The fly-patch does NOT mess multiplayer experience as there are no multiplayer in TR2, but this is an unnoficial cheating hack and use it only at your own risk. It may break the gameplay experience and I do not recommend it unless you already did the whole game. You can also find 16:9, 16:10 and 5:4 widescreen support patch. Use only trusted sources and scan patcher files for malware before launching them!TR2 Steam community posted many info about HD textures pack, controller configurations, walkthroughts, etc.BTW: TR2 had the campfire visible in first level... :>DISCLAIMER: If you are 2000+ era, you may not feel like we did in 90s. You may blame a complete lack of mouse support. You may blame tank controls (but Lara does sideways when jumping). You may blame slow movement animations which created that game playable on those computers (we wereveryhappy when having 5FPS in 640x480; well... we played so often using 320x240 back then...).But they are NOT real cons of that game. This is how games were designed back then for those hardware components (mostly no GPU, slow CPU, 4:3 CRT monitor and a ball-mouse).You may miss all those 125 hint arrows per level, glowing items and a voice which is constantly telling you what you should do in that room, butthis iswhy we love those old classics and why we spent a part of our life there without getting bored. Sometimes there is a graphics bug with shadows and you will be forced to live with it, to find a fix or to switch to software renderer (add ""-setup"" to launch options to invoke the setup window). IMHO if you are still curious and wanna try Classic TRs, buy TR Collection. You will get so many games including: TR1, TR2, TR Anniversary (modern TR1) up to TR2013 with DLCs which has great graphics, cute Lara model and a tiny, but great multiplayer community."

The game's internal logic fails when you start wondering why a modern day opera house is filled with the same kind of puzzles/traps you would traditionally find in an ancient tomb. Combat is over emphasized in this 1997 sequel with the vast majority of the game’s enemies being  gun totting muscle men.A decent enough game but a disappointing sequel with a muddled plot.If you’re looking a challenge then you’ve found it.I give this game a 8/10

With its intricate and creative level design, Tomb Raider II is an excellent example of this, and deserves the attention of any slower-paced adventure gamer today, despite being released almost 20 years ago.The combat isn't very interesting at all, but that's not what I'm here for. When I play the classic Tomb Raider games developed by Core (1-3), I think, ""Yay! Oldschool games with a fantastic sense of exploration!"", not, ""Yay! I get to jump around while shooting a bunch of generic bad guys with awful AI!"". Fortunately, there isn'ttoomuch combat in TR II, and I often found myself solving puzzles and examining various rooms in complete solitude. Speaking of puzzles, I felt that the game's difficulty was just right -- tricky enough so that I couldn't breeze through a level, but at the same time not ridiculously difficult/illogical as to require a walkthrough whenever a new room is entered. I never felt like there wastoomuch backtracking, either (TR 4 has far too much backtracking in my opinion, and thinking about that game just makes me want to punch something, but I digress).Overall, Tomb Raider II is a very high-quality adventure/exploration game, but I rank it lower than TR 1 or 3 due to the four sunken ship levels that occur about half-way into the game. These levels weren't BAD in design, but I got rather sick of running around rusted and ugly engine rooms after awhile. The other locations were top-notch, though -- Barkhang Monastery is a beautiful place to get lost in. You can expect to spend at least 12 hours on TR II without using a walkthrough, so it's a great buy for its price.Just for reference, here’s how I would rate Tomb Raider 2 relative to the other classic Tomb Raider games I have played, from best to worst:Tomb Raider 1Tomb Raider 3 (Read my review)Tomb Raider: AnniversaryTomb Raider: LegendTomb Raider 2Tomb Raider 5 (Read my review)Tomb Raider: UnderworldTomb Raider 4(I haven’t played Angel of Darkness)"

It was one of the games that helped spawn the mighty fandom of the Tomb Raider franchise. It's graphics were likely pretty good for the time, but I only played it a few years later, and I still loved it. The water is particularly impressive considering it was released in 1997. However, I can't recommend buying this. The reason why is that it appears they did nothing, or next to nothing, to make it more capable of running on modern machines. When I first launched it, the setup appeared behind the main window, so I couldn't edit it. I didn't even know it was supposed to appear, so I just clicked return, and the game loaded up, with most of the right side black, and part of the left side cut off. I checked for settings, to no avail. Like a few extremely old games, the video setup is separate from the game (and not exactly intuitive to access from within Steam). Opening it, I wasn't able to change the full screen resolution from 640x480 for some reason. After disabling my second monitor, and setting my main monitor to 800x600 (the smallest resolution where I could still see the apply button), I managed to get the game to appear correctly. A bit of a hassle to say the least. I also installed the widescreen patch. After restarting to re-enable my second monitor, I then tried it in windowed mode. Steam absolutely will not launch it in windowed mode. I had to open it from the exe. It was a travesty. It kept switching the resolution to 640x480 despite being in windowed mode, and was impossible to play. But, somehow, after that, I restarted, and tried it again from steam, and it magically just worked, in full screen mode, without disabling my second monitor. It was still in 640x480 unfortunately, but there was no black bar on one side, and it appeared correctly. I played it for a few minutes before my computer switched to another application on it's own, because the standard keys are set for alt to be the jump key.So, I will play through this game once more, and keep it on my Steam to occasionally play, but I really don't suggest anyone else buys it. They didn't do a thing to try to remove any bugs or anything from what I can tell. They simply took the old retail version and packaged it for steam. Frankly, I would be embarrassed if I worked for them. They should either hand the code to some of their team to squash some bugs occasionally, and clean up the code, or open source it, so maybe someone out there somewhere will choose to clean up the code for them. This game is barely playable on a modern machine. I'm likely gonna have to set up a virtual machine just to play this and a few other old games giving me trouble."

Sure, it takes time to get used to the controls, but when you do, you will find out this is one of the most precise control systems.Now, finally to the review. I have very fond memories of this game and consider it one of the top games in Tomb Raider franchise. Great choice of locations (China, Venice, wreck of Maria Doria, Tibet), thick atmosphere and simple, but sufficient story...yes, there aren't as many movement options as in its successor, Tomb Raider III, but I never thought that matters. The only downside to this great game is the Steam port - what the flip is the problem with FMVs? They're all windowed and in small resolution. But other than that, this game is brilliant.

I absolutely don't recommend playing it as is, it looks really bad. Download and install the widescreen patch(http://tombraiders.net/stella/downloads/widescreen.html)first, then download this patch if the game displays a Windows border in fullscreen mode(http://community.pcgamingwiki.com/files/file/82-tomb-raider-series-fullscreen-border-fix/). The cutscenes are interlaced and look awful, but I remember them looking just as bad back in 1997.Now you're all set to play what many consider to be the best Tomb Raider game ever made. Compared to its predecessor, Tomb Raider 2 is much more action oriented. Personally I always liked this game more than the original, even if the combat is still the same lackluster ""run around like a headless chicken while holding the Fire button"" kind of thing. Other than being combat heavy, it's your standard classic Tomb Raider. Puzzles, platforming, deadly traps, mysterious artifacts, it's all there.Even after all these years, TR2 still has a charm that cannot be matched. There's something about its low poly enemies and silence only occasionally interrupted by bursts of music that makes this game scarier than the latest photorealistic reboot.I'm probably biased since this is a game I've completed many, many times since the 90's and I consider it to be the best game in the entire Tomb Raider franchise, but to me everything about it is perfect. Its controls are outdated but solid and you get used to them quickly. The sound design is amazing, the atmosphere creepy. The levels are huge with lots of nooks and cranies to explore and secrets to discover.Even if you're not an old Tomb Raider fan and you've only just discovered the franchise, do yourself a favor and play this game to see how the legend started.Oh, and whatever you do, do NOT press F12 while playing. It'll force the game into windowed mode and cutscenes will stop working. You'll then have to quit the game, go back to Steam and change the game settings back to fullscreen."

The level design of these games is just so intelligent that it exposes a lot of modern games.Very, very clunky controls, though, so not too many people will be able to stomach this one in large doses. A step down from Mario 64. You will die many times and 95% of the time will be due to controls and bad camera angles. Some jumping puzzles are actually a bit of trial and error since you can't see where you're supposed to go at all times."

Following on from Lara's adventures in Tomb Raider, Lara finds herself in pursuit of a mythical Chinese artifact, The Dagger of Xian. Lara's journey begins at the Great Wall in China, then to the city of Venice, deep under the sea to the wreckage of the ship, Maria Doria, then to TIbet and finally back to China to face off against the leader of the Fiamma Nera, Marco Bartolli.Gameplay is considerably like the first game, only Lara can now climb ladders, twist around in mid-air or underwater to face the other way, use flares to light up dark areas and carries a much bigger arsenal with weapons like the Grenade Launcher, Harpoon Gun and Automatic Pistols, whilst still maintaining weapons from the first, like the Shotgun and Uzis. Lara controls much better in this game, runs faster than in TR1, Lara also has a new voice actress replacing Shelley Blond, the more mature and rich voice of Judith Gibbins. Another thing to be noted is that Lara has several costume changes in-game, you start in the classic gear, later she changes to a wetsuit for the underwater levels, and finally dons a bomber jacket for the cold Tibetan Foothills before returning to the classic look for the final levels. Nathan McCree returns from the first game to compose the music, and it is chilling! The title theme is a very memorable one, but some of the music can really chill, even scare you!This game is by no means short. It can be quite complicated, but with a good look around and a lot of thought, you can beat it! Highly recommend it, very essential game for any fan of Tomb Raider, good luck!"

Unfortunately, I'm not able to truly replay it because my eye condition gives me too much trouble distinguishing things in the game with the old graphics. It gives me headaches trying. Still, this is from the old days of Tomb Raider games, when they were truly unforgiving, with precarious controls, a major learning curve, and somewhat brutal gameplay. What I mean is, these games didn't hold your hand, which makes them among the best adventure games ever released.Also, as much as I couldn't replay the game as much as I wanted to, I am extremely happy to report that you can indeed still lock the butler in the freezer! Not gonna lie - I literally rushed to do that first thing after downloading the title. It's still one of the best easter eggs ever put into a game.Until the original Lara Croft games are finally given a much-needed remaster to bring them up-to-date with the smooth controls and graphics of today, as I am still hoping will happen someday, the original release is the best you can do, and still very much worth it. The graphics are bad, the controls are poor (that 360 rotational turning drives me crazy now - maybe it's just me) but functional, and the DosBox that runs the game is downright terrible and makes it easy to accidentally crash the whole thing. But, from what I played of it, the nostalgia is off the charts, and the amazingness of the game still comes through loud and clear. Highly recommend!"

I first joined the series when I was five or so and AoD had just been released. Despite that game being considered a low point in the series I loved it. To me there was something about Lara, something about her adventures and the history mixed with mythology that made them unique.Tomb Raider II was, and still is I might add, considered a high point for the series. Not only due to the commercial success it experienced almost twenty years ago but because of everything about it. The game was in 3d which at the time was not really a thing, save for Mario 64, and not only that but it feautured an awesome protagonist, an awesome story and very good graphics for the time. Sure it may not hold up today but it is definitely a game worth revisiting for long time fans of the series or a game worth discovering for people who were drawn in due to the 2013 reboot of the series.The plot follows Lara one year after the first game as she seacrhes for an ancient Chinese dagger said to possess the powers of a dragon to whomever plunges it into their chest. This search takes her all over the world, from China to Venice and beyond. Along the way you will experience fun, and sometimes challenging, platforming, fight all sorts of enemies from feeble spiders to mythalogical monsters. If you don't want to follow the main story right away or you maybe want a refresher course in the controls you can always visit Laras home: Croft Manor. It features an assault course, a hedge maze, various rooms and you can lock her butler Winston in the fridge so, you know, the usual for the classic tomb raider games.Whether you are new to the series or are revisiting it, this is definitely a game worth buying and really what do you have to lose? It's very cheap on steam and virtually everywhere else. However, I must say that it does take a while to get back into the controls which are a little clucky by modern standards but once you do it fits like an old glove."

One year after Tomb Raider took over the world, the team at Core design return with what is considered by many, myself included as the very best Tomb Raider game in the original series.The story of Tomb Raider II surrounds the mythical 'Dagger of Xian', a weapon which was used by an Emperor of China to command his army. By plunging the weapon into its owner's heart, the weapon has the power to turn its bearer into a dragon. The last battle fought with the Dagger ended when the warrior monks of Tibet removed the knife from the Emperor's heart, whereupon the Emperor died. The Dagger was then returned to its resting place within the Great Wall of China. This will take Lara all over the world and she will battle a dangerous cult intent on getting their hands on the dagger.  As before this is told through FMV cut scenes and in game clips, these are an improvement on before and there is more voice acting than in the previous game which helps improve the story telling experience. As before however it’s not always easy to tell what’s going on but you always have a rough idea and it keeps the game moving well.I personally preferred the story in Tomb Raider 2 to the first game and it takes Lara from the Great Wall of China to Venice then onto an underwater shipwreck, then to the mountains of Nepal and back to China. The level design is fantastic here and all the levels feel unique. One of my complaints about the first game is that many levels felt similar in design, but in Tomb Raider 2 this is not the case, they all stand out with tough, puzzles, great exploration and improved combat. Special mention must go to the Barkhang Monastery level that sees Lara explore an ancient monastery that’s full of great puzzles, many enemies and monks that if left un harmed, aid Lara against the cult members. In 1997 this was very impressive and it made the level stand out in gaming let alone Tomb Raider 2 with the impressive number of people on screen and AI.Graphically Tomb Raider 2 is much improved over the original. Lara’s model has been improved with a higher polygon count, her famous ponytail also makes its first appearance here and reacts impressively to the way Lara moves, running over her shoulder and reacting to wind ect. Environments also look improved with more varied textures, Lara will find herself in more modern surroundings such as Venice and an oil rig rather than just ancient tombs. Dynamic lighting has also been added, Lara’s weapons will cause light to bounce off the environment as she fires them and she now has flares to help brighten up darker areas.Game play has been greatly improved this time around, from the moment I picked up Tomb Raider 2 Lara felt more responsive and allot less “tank” like. It makes it much easier to play Tomb Raider 2 in 2017 than say Tomb Raider 1. Combat has been improved with more guns added to Lara’s arsenal, a grenade launcher, M16 assault rifle and harpoon for underwater combat have been added alongside the classic duel pistols, uzi’s and shotgun. The amount of gun fights in the game has been increased with Lara fighting many more human enemies this time around, the AI is rather standard for 1997 and at times can be relentless in their pursuit of Lara. The combat to exploration balance in Tomb Raider 2 feels perfect and adds a new dimension to the game play. The save system has also been changed, dropping the save crystal’s from the first game for a save anywhere system that makes the game far more forgiving than before, no longer will you have to play through the same sections of the game over and over again when you die.Tomb Raider 2 is an impressive achievement, in one year Core Design has managed to improve on the original in almost every way and create an all time classic. Not only is it one of the best games in the original Tomb Raider series, it’s one of the best games on the original PlayStation.If you’re a fan of Tomb Raider, Lara Croft or action adventure games, it’s a must play!9.6/10 – PC     9.4/10 – PS1"

The game, however, runs well enough for me, and that's all I care about (but I'm very forgiving in terms of gfx and resolution).- the platforming and puzzles are awesome and in my opinion, that's what the game is about. This game is pretty slow and methodic and if you want to find all the secrets, items, and explore every nook and cranny in general, then this is your cup of tea. The environments are varied, the gameplay never gets stale although some levels (like the motherfreakin' sunken ship) drag on for a bit too long.- the combat, however, is A-T-R-O-C-I-O-U-S. Whoever thought this game needed shooting should jump into a spike pit, seriously, I canNOT stress enough how clunky, unfair, cheap and absolutely unnecessary this aspect is. Let me give you an example. You can take around 10 shots before you drop dead. The bad guys in the later levels need 2 to 3 GRENADE SHOTS. Let that sink in. I don't care if it's ""just a game"", no videogame iteration of a human grunt-type enemy should be able to withstand three grenades to the noggin.That said, for me, the platforming outweighs the terrible combat just enough to get a ""Recommend"" from me.

Actually you should just accept those things as a fact of life and attempt to keep the damage to your surroundings to a minimum whenever it happens. You'll swear it'll never happen again. I promise it will.ANYWAY I am loving this game, my dad is loving the nostalgia, and my cat is loving my keyboard.Happy gaming!"

But the same people would probably have complained about ""more of the same"" if Tomb raider 2 had continued on the path of exploring old ruins...But It's very interesting never the less , and I very much enjoyed the levels of this game. The difficulty is at time rather staggering even more than TR1 , but with perseverance it offers great gameplay and a real sense of discovery following the female counterpart of Indiana Jones.Apart from the oil platform which was rather ugly, the levels are beautifully done and rather unique, like exploring the inside of a sunken luxury ship deep on the bottom of the ocean or a mysterious tibetan temple with its gorgeous art. Yes even through the game is from 1997 and rather blocky, it's still beautifully made and worth a look or three. The game is difficult but never unfairly hard and there is a great deal more of shooting bad guys than the first.Great game overall, demand a lot of commitment to complete, but felt quite rewarding when you got there with a rather funny almost pastiche ending."

It changes up things, offering more urban areas to explore like Venice and an oil rig, as well as an ancient sunken ship. The atmosphere is always intense in this game and exploring all the various levels is a lot of fun.There's also more human enemies in this game and in my opinion, better level design than TR1. The controls are also improved slightly with more fluent combos. And this was the first game to give Lara's hair its own AI... for what that's worth.Overall an improvement over TR1 and with hardware acceleration was one of the best looking games of its time."

,Not Recommended,225300,16509813,"Posted: 18 June, 2015",all,Szarps;,"I will resume this game in one word, punishing. So i will break this down easily, when you are making a game, you must adjust the difficulty according to the gameplay mechanics avalibable. The game is clrearly much more hard than the first one (which is nice) but the problem is its badly directed the way they want you to go across all the things. Lets say that if this game has the mechanics and flexibility the TR of the 2000's, it would be an awesome game with just about the right difficulty to keep it chalenging while still punishing you for the mistakes you make. I'm also aware the game has almost 20 years old, but man I grow playing this old games and believe me when I say that it was a common mistake the idea of implementing extreme difficulty with low and unflexible mechanics in games, you may say: ""that is the whole idea"" if that so, then why with the advance in tecnology we have, the games are getting more easy? 2 reasons, as the time passes by the mechanics become more natural, the characters are more easy to control and they do less award things and are A LOT more responsive at any command you throw them and the second is marketing (for the sake of hitting the most amount of audiencie possible so everyone can enjoy, therefor much more money).Now putting aside the unflexible gameplay, the game is pretty solid, havent played enough to talk about the history but seems ""OK"", the level desing is pretty awesome and is really well desing to hide the secrets (except for a part on the first level where there is like 2 pickups that require EXTREME coordination (not impossible though) that is more a flaw in the engine where if you are nearby an item lara won't walk to it and interact with it (like underwater) you must step right up and then you can pick it up and this is really annoying because this 2 pickups are in a context where if you aren't fast enough you die and if you pick them up you must pay with a little blood (usually more than 15% of your health, but if you were fast you could make it in one piece but is really hardly likely to happen.), the sound effects has changed a little since the last game and are fairly better, graphics are a bit better (mostly lara's model because now she has her pony tale and it also moves when she runs and if you are in an outside level and idle, the hair will simulate the breeze of wind) and texture overall are at the same quality as the last one, and for the year this game was released they were amazing. Menu still uses the same base, now the compass (which was useless as I never use it) is gone and replaced with a chronometer which give you stats on your game so far, from time taken, secrets founds (which are now 3 little statues per level), and ammo/health packs used, so a pretty nice progress. Also nice progress on the video department, the game doesnt require a DOS OP/DOSbox because windwos 95/98 where already a thing for most PC at the time, plus now in the first start of the game now displays a menu so you can configure it, and the best thing is the res of the game it adapts according to your video card (basically you can run the game on +720p without any problem nor needing to installing nothing).-Some annoying bugs:-if the ""roof"" is a bit close to you, you cant perform a jump at all, and this didnt happen with his successor-If you have custom controls, whenever you relaunch the game, it will use both (your bindings and the default ones, just like the first game) so you need to go to controls in the menu and reselect (everytime you wanna play) ""user controls"", otherwise if you bind the space bar with jump you will jump but you also grab your guns.TL;DR: the game is too punishing for the unflexiblie gameplay/mechanics it has, also the desingners could have done a better job (like as they allowed you to roll in the air and underwater) with some minor details like the way you need to be near an item to pick it up or interact with it on land, grab some of the edges with a less level of exigency and climbing a LOT faster. If you dont mind that things go ahead and play it, otherwise, skip yourself a possible butthurt"

Twenty hours between the first game and this one; the controls still don't feel natural. In fact, pretty much every problem I have with the game (much like the first game) can be traced back to the controls. It's not even the same case as something like Dark Souls, La-Mulana, or even Gunvalkyrie where the control scheme is just different and you get used to it after an hour or two. I do get it, though. I do get why this game is still so well-received. It's because of the people who played it back in the day. I'll admit it; I'm the same way with Glover. Lotsa people hate that game for the controls, but I think they're just fine. I also admit that the reason why I can get the controls to work is because I played it so much when I was younger.As for Tomb Raider, this is my first time with the series. I didn't grow up with it, so I came into the series as an outsider. Again, as far as everything else goes, I quite liked it. The puzzles are great, the atmosphere was incredible in the first game, especially when things go all Lovecraftian. The platforming and combat... could've been great as well, had the controls been better. However, when even after 20 some hours I still haven't gotten used to the controls, I don't think that's a problem on my end. That's why I can't recommend this game to first-timers of the series. It seems like a petty complaint, but once again, all of the problems I've had with the past two games stem from the controls. I won't give this a score, as I haven't completed the game. I don't think I will in the future, either. Here's to hoping I can enjoy Tomb Raider 3."
,Not Recommended,225300,12615865,"Posted: 24 October, 2014",all,OmniMoron,"TLDR: The neverending story of backtracking, dying in blind platforming sections, opening doors with levers located miles away and tanking bullets in a hellish savefest. This game is not exatly how I remembered it to be.I had good memories of this game when it was released originally. Unfortunately they were far from the truth.It must have been just the horny teenager me drooling over Lara Crofts low polygon curves and hearing her moan while she climbs stuff. And I did stop back then like at the Venice levels or so, cause the jumping got on my nerves then too.There's nothing else in this game than visually cool looking places (which are kinda crappy looking nowadays) and some later single enemies to keep you interested in it.The plot is ridiculous, but let's get over it and see what we have left.You collect white, yellow and green phallus statues(?) as a hobby while doing your ridiculous quest of killing hundreds of hired guns and endangered animals that spawn from thin air.Enemies are harmless, only the flamethrower and snowmobile guys can kill you early on/middle game. That is IF you don't mess up your camera controls and lose sight of you and your enemies. You take bullets like a tank, but if you get set on fire or a snowmobile runs over your toes, you die instantly. Also as you would expect crows do more damage that bullets.Doors in this world are operated not by door handles, but huge levers located on the other side of the city.Controls are ok for the most part, but it's really hard to get used to the quirks like the player not jumping immidiately. Wall/object clipping is horrible in some places and ruins jumps and makes diving a pain in the rocky parts.You don't really aim your guns, Lara does it for you while you're jumping backflips. I really liked that feature when I played the game first time and still think it's really cool.The graphics ok for a game this old and some of the places are visually really good looking. But the graphics are generally REALLY unclear and make finding what ever you're searching very hard. Simple things like ledges are hidden in the textures which are not seamless at all.Lara's animations look great, but the basic thug animations look really poor. Their walking animation is like Minecraft Alpha poor.Enemies AI is crap too. Enemies also spawn to areas you have already cleared behind you (with no entrances).Videos didn't play ok on my computer, they played fullscreen interlaced with what ever program I had open on background showing through the video.Sounds are really crappy. Music was ok and some even good, but there was little of it.-The player animations take FOREVER, are not cancelable and you have to repeat them in order to progress in the game. Even death animations have to wait for the previous to complete.(This makes 30% of the play time)-The game relies on the player having to return to visited parts of the map constantly.(This makes 350%-1050% of the play time)-Some platformer sections are a pain and require you to know where to jump beforehand blindly.(This makes 20% of the play time and forces you to save every 3 seconds)I liked the puzzle solving (including the drag boxes type) parts, but they are the easy part and not a match to the annoyance of always searching the right kind of blurry texture for a way to go or knowing that you'll have to backtrack again to progress.The game takes a long time to complete. But it's not cause there's so much content, only because you have to backtrack 10 times (I'm not even exaggerating) every map and wait for the animations to complete.I ment to complete this game now for the 14 year old me, but it was so unbelievably painful that I had to stop right at the end before I gRJAF_AgatgrlagricASTKgu"

,Recommended,225300,8934749,"Posted: 1 February, 2014",all,DAMIENX88,Just like the original game Tomb Raider 2 is an excellent game. And it took me even longer than the firs one. Mainly because I searched more secrets and I was finding them.There are couple of major differences I noticed. First thing is that there were more puzzles and sometimes they are not as fun as you'd expect. There are additional mechanics in the game so I recommend playing through Lara's house first so you don't get stuck with some puzzles. While playing 43 hours of this game I could barely notice that the graphics are not really up to date but gameplay is absolutely awesome.Highly recommended for those who want to re-visit all Lara's adventures before playing the latest Tomb Raider games.

There are other levels, filled with baddies you kill underwater or above it, and the most recognized is the famous second level – Venice, with the boat. This is a great game, and, very much like the Hobbit, the tales you hear about a Dragon foreshadow the ending of this amazing trip that starts and ends in the Great Wall of China."

In many ways it's a refinement of the first game, carrying on with the same jumping and switch-throwing basics, but dressing them up in more varied environments. The somewhat monotonous rocks and sand of the original are swapped out for interesting locales like an opera house and sunken ship, and in a small but important change, most stages feature an outdoor portion under a blue sky.Lara herself has been given a big upgrade, with a brand new character model that better matches her promotional art. She finally gets to wear her iconic braid in-game, and her chest no longer looks like it could take your eye out. This game is also the start of costume changes for Lara, kicking off the tradition with a particularly famous wetsuit.Lara's action repertoire is expanded with two new moves. She can climb ladders now, which feels like a natural addition to her moveset, and integrates just as smoothly into the game's level designs. The new flares that she carries are less successful. Though necessary on a few occasions, it's questionable whether they earn having their own dedicated button – but at least they produce a nice lighting effect.On the downside, even in its second outing there are signs that classicTomb Raideris showing its age. Its new environments are assembled from the same clumsy building blocks of the first game, resulting in some weird proportions in places like the interiors of Lara's home. More egregiously, the majority of the enemies Lara faces this time are human, but with no difference in AI from the animal enemies she fought the first time around. Equipped with guns, the new human foes are a lot more dangerous, but your best tactic is still to find a high ledge where you can shoot repeatedly at them, as they stupidly run around in confused circles below. Eventually these encounters feel like tiresome interruptions of the core gameplay.Of course it's no surprise thatTomb Raider IIis at its best when it's not focused on combat, and the series' particular brand of puzzle platforming is still excellent when it's left alone to do its thing. Some standout stages are the monastery (which is formed as a central hub surrounded by short platforming challenges) and the temple (a thorough gauntlet that will test all the skills you've accumulated).With it's second game, theTomb Raiderseries was hurriedly growing into the fame that it had fallen into unexpectedly. Some of its improvements were essential to defining the character of the franchise's early years, and most of what was fun about the first game carries over intact. But at the same time, it's clear that the original formula is already being stretched toward its limit – and the series' ongoing struggle to balance action with adventure was a problem right from the first sequel."

This game is definitely one of the best games on the Playstation, alongside the first game. Since it has been a long time since I've ever played it (on PC), I had to get used to the controls and they got a little hard to get used to, but if you use a controller, then it's a BLAST! I do have some cons, but it's on the list below,~~~PROS~~~-Great level design-An outstanding soundtrack that fits Lara Croft-Interesting Puzzles-Great improvement from having cheap weapons (in the 1st) to having multiple weapons that are usable for most occasions, (Like using the Harpoon Gun underwater, which is a pretty impressive Improvement if you ask me.)-Flares (First Tomb Raider to have Flares)-The compass is replaced with a Status thing? (Really, That compass from the 1st game was absolutely useless.)-More cutscenes (Instead of having a cutscene at the end of the last level in the specific area.)-Most classic ending scene. (Everyone knows what I mean.)~~~CONS~~~-A kinda cliche story (The bad guy scares you then doesn't really appear until the end.)-This game has the least amount of bosses! (A total of 6! It's 4 if you don't count the T-Rex's that contain the Gold Dragon in the first level. And I did count the Double Pistol goonies in Opera House and Home Sweet Home.)-You can't change Screen Resolution (In the PC port.)-The only hard boss was the final boss, (""Whoever"" the Dragon.)-The classic 'I STEAL YOUR WEAPONS ♥♥♥♥♥!!' level. (Luckily, you keep your ammo, flares, and Health packs for some reason...)-Water Levels (Use that Harpoon Gun to your advantage, PLEASE!!)-Nude Code's existence (I love Core & Eidos adding that hilarious code, Every fan knows what I'm talking about.)-Hair Logic (Lara's hair flies all over the place e.e)-Stone Warriors Spear ones. (I hate these damn enemies so much... they are the killer of my nightmares.)This is the end of my review, I would definitely start the Series with this game if you're new to it.
