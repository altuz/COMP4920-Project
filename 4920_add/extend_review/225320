This game was designed to be an Indian Jones style game, and it nails it. The enviroment is full of traps, dangerous jumps, puzzles, and aggressive wildlife.You never feel safe in this game, you wont find any hand holding here, you have to explore every bit of the levels just to find out what to do, then you have to experiment ( with jumps, running to avoid, long swims where worry about running out breath)and finally perform all the platforming, shootouts, and puzzle solving perfectly to get to the next level. Because of this the games enviroments feel more alive and real then most newer and graphically better games. The most important thing you have to keep in mind is that the controls will take time to get used to, but once you do you will actually like playing the game this way the game is built with these controls in mind and is expertly designed. Every little movement is in your controll from walking, running, the angle of your jump, grabing, pulling yourself up, these are all controlled with individual button presses where most game especially today will do all that automatically, it is much more challenging, but in the end you feel far more like you actually achieved your moves then you do in any game made today. make sure to google or check the forums to get the game running right on modern OS, dont let that discourage you from playing these amazing games."

The locations are: India (starting location), Nevada, South Pacific, London, Antarctica (final location). The game is great (just like any other TR) and if you like adventures, gunfights and puzzles - be sure to play it.The game also has an addon named The Lost Artifact which you can download for free. It adds extra special levels that can be played separately.There's also a widescreen patch that allows you to play in 16:9 and other aspect ratios.

Looking at it now she wiggles like a fish however back then, it was pretty damn cool as she explains about her new adventures being Tomb Raider 3 – Adventures of Lara Croft. Of course she describes that Tomb Raider 3 is the most exciting adventure yet as she has new outfits to wear, new locations to explore, advance AI, new features like sprint and so on however there was a key element right at the end of this clip stating she hopes we take good care of her. Well, whilst Tomb Raider 3 has all these new features, once thing is for certain, it's the hardest out of the three by a mile.Whilst made all of those promises, and they are the words straight from Lara herself, the game play hasn't really changed much from the previous installments. Granted she does all those acrobatic maneuvers and showing no signs of vertigo, it still is the same game with different locations. Being the third installment, you think developers Core Design improves some of the game play like better camera angles or have the ability to use the mouse. Unfortunately this was not the case so veterans of the other two games shouldn't have any issues with the controls or putting up with the odd perk like the camera facing directly at Lara front on whilst jumping. Newcomers though will have great difficulty though.http://www.gamespot.com/tomb-raider-iii-adventures-of-lara-croft/user-reviews/2200-12585765/7 / 10"

This is one of the Tomb Raider games I didn't play much when I was younger because I thought it was too difficult for me at the time. I still think it's pretty challenging, but it's fun. The graphics are definitely PSX graphics but the game looks and runs smoothly. So far I'm really enjoying this game and cannot wait to actually complete it.My only complaint is that I find the game's lighting is a bit dark during some levels. I just found out, however, instead of constantly using flares, you can just adjust the gamma settings to a higher number. Standard is 3 and I find 4-5 to be perfect. However, changing the gamma settings is pointless because if I try to save or load my game anytime afterwards, the game will crash. I've even tried to change it back to 3 before saving and it does not help. It's rather annoying because  I'm trying to get a good look of my surroundings but if I die I have to load my save file and the game crashes. It will crash even if I attempt to select ""controls"". I would love to know if there is a fix for this!EDIT: Found the fix for this, had to go in the game's file folder and manually change the settings by editing the ""config"" file. If anyone needs help with this, you can right click on the game in your library and clicking Properties>Local Files>Browse Local Files and the then search for the ""config"" document and edit the desired setting there.I also noticed that there are some rather strange graphic glitches from time-to-time. I'll upload them to my steam gallery, currently not sure what causes it but restarting the game usually helps. It's only happened twice."

Your able to pick which parts of the world you go to before eventually culminating in a climax in Antarctica. The story keep your attention and finishes nicely with an uber hard boss fight.Now as much as I like TR3 there are some downsides. Specifically with this port. In the PS1 port of Tomb Raider 3, they removed quicksaving and instead had the player find collectable items that let you quicksave. In the PC port they brought back being able to quicksave anywhere, but kept the savegame crystals and just had them restore your health.

,Not Recommended,225320,32694298,Posted: 23 June,all,Visual Vincent,"I've always loved the old Tomb Raider games and have all of them on CD. I decided to buy them on Steam so I wouldn't have to worry about scratching or breaking the CDs, however it didn't turn out very well (at least not for TR3).Launching the game from Steam after copying my old save files I instantly noticed plenty of invisible walls in the first London level. Walking into them causes Lara to stop, but running into them causes her to glitch up to a ledge above, thus not being able to go into the area.After installing the CD version again I found that these glitches ARE NOT there in the original game, which made me kind of disappointed at the Steam version.Can I really trust that the other five Tomb Raider games I bought don't have such glitches as well?"
,Recommended,225320,13657880,"Posted: 27 December, 2014",all,DotA 2 was a mistake.,"Now, I will admit, that I am somewhat affected by nostalgia here, but I do think that this game is great fun, even today.I think that other games have filled its niche pretty well; (I feel like Demon's Souls, Dark Souls, and Bloodborne capture the feeling I had playing these), but I still like these games, despite their often obtuse and illogical design. There are definitely some stand out examples of really great, fun levels, and you  get to choose to tackle them in whichever order you please, adding strategy and replayability to the game.The game is unabashedly completely bonkers, too. No pretentions about adhering to some internal logic; the game is unafraid of showing you some of the most ridiculous stuff.Lizard men!Immortal Lizard Men in the sewers!Magical make up corporation CEO woman!The coolest, but also most ridiculous depiction of Antarctica I've ever seen!Just be ready for some level design that really is lacking. When ya have a short development cycle, to develop a fully-fledged game with plenty of areas, and you also have to make a bunch of technical improvements, and redo the story and lore, design tends to suffer. Don't get me wrong; this game is loaded with all the ingenious traps and puzzles you'd expect from a Tomb Raiding simulator, but the ♥♥♥♥en spiked ceiling rooms, and Thames Wharf seriously make me want to go raid my own tomb, via a cyanide pill and funeral.Overall, it's quite dated, but it's close to my heart, and it's still got some really cool♥♥♥♥♥♥in it."
,Recommended,225320,26092758,"Posted: 17 October, 2016",all,Mr Torgue High-Five Flexington,"Tomb Raider III is still totally playable on today's operating systems, and while short compared to some games of today, is still worth it.For those that are unaware, these early TR titles tend not to vary too much in play style - it's an action adventure set in the 3rd person perspective, but you can't aim as Lara does all that for you, assuming enemies are in range and can be damaged(although once you start firing it IS possible to continue to do so after moving out of range, provided you don't let go of the trigger!). Also, the camera cannot be altered, and enemies tend to have very limited behaviours/scripts, making it easy to (literally) run rings around them.Lara begins the journey in a jungle setting initially. After completion of the jungle some degree of choice is imparted to us, but be sure to research into your acquisition of the rocket launcher, and the map that strips you of all your weapons. The locations are varied and different enough to ensure the game doesn't get boring too fast. India, the South Pacific, Nevada, London and even Antarctica round out the base game, brought to life with aggressive animals and improved visual effects.Since the last title, Lara can now crouch and sprint in addition to everything she could do before. Sprinting is problematic - Lara steers like a brick while running, so you wont want to do it too often. It makes sense that any Tomb Raider worth their salt should be able to crouch and crawl, so this is a welcome addition to the (somewhat repetitive) gameplay. Monkey-swinging is now possible too.There are some new ways to die too. Quicksand takes a bit of getting used to, but piranha-infested waters should be avoided at all costs. Fall in accidentally and before you know it Lara will be colouring the water red with no time to get out. Poison is introduced as well, mostly in the form of dart traps, but also from blow darts fired by natives with painful looking nose-piercings. The only way to stop poison is to use a health pack or healing crystal, otherwise it'll continue to deplete your health. Perhaps disappointingly, it is still possible to die by dinosaur though. I was surprised they weren't extinct in TR2 around the Great Wall, but now I'm just 'meh' about them hiding under rocks all over the world.The 'then' impressive graphical improvements include smoking gun barrels after firing your pistols, water reflections, coloured lighting, better fire, rain and snow. I recall the problems on our 'then' computer and laugh heartily. Graphics should be a non-issue these days, but if they are, just play around with the setup options.While there have been criticisms in the past about the violence in the series, I have no problem with it. Compared to some games the violence herein is tame. Killing military officers and police doesn't ring entirely true with the character of Lara Croft, who always seemed to me above that sort of thing. She does start her ventures armed with simple pistols after all, suggesting enough experience to know to expect trouble and be able to deal with it, but not so armed to the teeth as to go actively looking for trouble. Greater effort could have gone into the Nevada / Area 51 sub-plot to make it more stealth-friendly - stealth that is proven to have worked in the game in the case of at least one secret that requires no alarm to be raised before Lara reaches it. Shooting up police and military doesn't gel with the mansion-living, quick-witted, smart-minded, aristocratic Lara, in my mind.Ultimately TR3 is an enjoyable game, and while it's showing its age (and despite the moral ambiguity) it is still very much replayable today."
,Not Recommended,225320,25458643,"Posted: 11 September, 2016",all,crashdown,"Tomb raider 3 end the triology,  however after TR1 and 2 , the game really feel ... stretched. The core game is the same, but it's bigger, more advanced with more mechanic, more however doesn't make it better.An exemple is the plot, the storyline in TR1 was simple but efficient, TR2 was less elegant but you still could follow it. In TR3 it's all over the place with an abrupt ending that doesn't really make sence. In my own opinion, the team behind the game put it together in the last minute probably after some disagreement.The game is built around those large levels but they don't seem to work well together, they're not horrible, but the difficult spikes, the bugs, the cheap deads make them very annoying at times. Making those levels bigger probably sounded like a good idea at the time, but they add to the difficulty as often I had no idea where to go or what to do next as the game is very stingy with hints . Trying and failing (often dying) was my only option. For parts of the game a walkthrough is necessary unless you feel like using weeks on end exploring the vast levels for small keys or crystals hidden in dark corners to open secret doors.To make things worse , some parts of the game are positively dull, the London levels are the worse in that respect. They're dark, confusing and depressing with few positive moments, as a player you fell you have to plough through those levels and get them over with.TR3 has its good moments, the core gameplay is there, solving the mysteries or finding your path in the sometimes confusing levels feels rewarding. But smaller and bigger problems in the gameplay cheapen those moments. The controll which never was very good hasn't changed much since TR1 and 2 making things harder for the player as they feel as uneven as ever in an environment that is bigger and more difficult than previous games. This results in cheap deads very often and the liberal use of saves and loads to progress.The great atmosphere in the game is hit and miss, some level felt almost like the original tomb raiders, others felt just dark and cramped and I couldn't wait to finish them. To it's benifit they're varied, you even get to visit a couple of temples , but they still don't give the feel of awe the original gave you. TR3 isn't as pretty as TR2 either, and while it has its moment, it's easily the ugliest of the three.In Conclusion, TR3 isn't a bad game , it's good in its core, but a miriad of problems and bugs makes it a lesser game than it could have been. Play only if you want to experience the Tomb Raider serie (as I do) , you'll have some good moments if you can oversee all its faults. I can't however objectively recommand this game to most gamers."

,Recommended,225320,20941560,"Posted: 3 February, 2016",all,croftmanor,"Oh boy, where to start?Tomb Raider III: Adventures of Lara Croft is not a bad game. It's not necessarily a good game, either. While the developers added a lot to the default Tomb Raider experience (including new volumetric lighting and 3D particle effects) and enhanced the otherwise unchanged and familiar gameplay formula of jumping, climbing, puzzling, shooting and dying by handing Lara a new set of skills including crawling through tight spaces, a much needed sprinting feature and monkey-swinging your way across certain areas, the game ended up being needlessly convoluted and confusing.For the first time in the series the player can choose where Lara travels next in her adventure after each completed chapter with locations ranging from the dark and rainy London over a mysterious island in the South Pacific, to a highly guarded secret military base in the deserts of Nevada. Only the beginning that takes place in and around abandoned temple ruins in an Indian jungle and the ending of the game are not selectable for story-related reasons.It is certainly not a feature that was needed but it's a neatly implemented idea that offers some minor freedoms to the player with different weapons and ammunition pickups being available in certain sections of the game that might be helpful in others.While the level design in both of the prequels was executed extremely well, Tomb Raider III throws you into a ton of complex and most of the time downright annoying areas that require so much backtracking you'll find yourself running around the levels aimlessly for hours, not knowing where to go or what the game wants from you. Some parts are so ridiculous you'll want to delete the game once you find out what you were supposed to do in order to progress.In terms of locations there is a huge variety of different structures and themes to explore much like in Tomb Raider II even though this time they tend to feel rather random and make you wonder what the hell the writers were thinking when they came up with certain places and designs.Obviously the locations don't come without a plot, which might be the biggest weak point of the game. Granted, the franchise isn't known for captivating stories but while Tomb Raider I and II both did a fairly good job at introducing the player to villains, side characters and overall themes and lore, this game just... doesn't. None of the things you encounter make any sense whenever you find your mind drifting off and occupying itself with questioning them even the slightest. The villains have no sort of backstory let alone motivations for their actions, the settings Lara finds herself in feel almost incidental and even though the main drive of her actions, the so called Infada Artifacts (named after an Indian temple where Lara assumes the only one of the relics to be located only to find out there are actually several more), are not as obscure as the Dagger of Xian (the object of desire in the previous game), they still feel out of place and the writing and lore accompanying them is simply uninspired and lackluster.Hold on, didn't I say Tomb Raider III wasn't necessarily a bad game? Whoops. Well, to be fair, I do enjoy playing through it every once in a while but only because I have suffered enough over the past decade to know where all the hidden (or should I say damn near invisible) items and passageways are and because level skip cheats exist and I don't have to torture myself with some of the ludicrous level design choices.Well, ultimately it's up to you as usual but let my review be a warning and try to take a few breaks before breaking your keyboard in two out of sheer frustration."

76561197967670714,Recommended,225320,9001203,"Posted: 6 February, 2014",all,BernSkeetz,"Played on Windows 7 Home EditionBefore playing any of these games you have to understand that they are extremely dated. People who haven't been introduced to the greatness that was the playstation, or perhaps as far back as the Super Nintendo should not buy and play any of these games. I rather like the idea of being able to play some of the greatest classics of the time.First to note are bugs that I have encountered:- Setting up the controls took forever as the game kept freezing right at the keybind menu.--To get around that, if it should happen, set all your vid settings first, then exit the game. This will ensure they are not lost. Then play Lara's Mansion. You may have to use the controls already preset for a little bit. Then go into the menu and change your controls to whatever works. Those who have played Tomb Raider using an emulator via the disk drive will most likely know what kind of control scheme seems to work. It sucks but you can get used to it. Exit the game when you are done to save your settings. You may have to go into the keybind and set it to user keys each time you play because the game allows keybind conflicts between the two. So when you crouch she may draw her pistols. Going into the keybind menu seems to remedy that for some reason.Other than that, I haven't come up with any other bugs. It doesn't use DosBox so that is a major plus. With the higher resolution available it looks a lot nicer than playing on the playstation. Music works fine. I don't know if there are supposed to be sounds when picking up an item, like there was with TR2. If there is, then they are absent.The reality is, in todays standards the game is a 3/10. The only thing that makes it a 3 is the fact that the puzzles are very clever and force you to be calculating in your moves. Today's games are so linear and so shoot'em up that you can run anywhere. Even the latest Tomb Raider titles are like that. Not this game or any of the Core Design TR titles.If you have never played the game on playstation and if you have never used control schemes like these, do not buy these games. They are strictly fan-only as they are extremely dated and VERY DIFFICULT. However, I do recommend this title to those who have played the series in the past."

,Recommended,225320,35275041,Posted: 28 September,all,PookPunk,"Tomb Raider III is probably the most challenging entry in the series. Essentially, it's Tomb Raider I and II on steroids. Core Design focuses more on opening the environments up a bit more by making the levels bigger and non-linear. Honestly, Core achieved this better with The Last Revelation.TRIII has a variety of content, probably more so than the other classic TR installments. Core implemented new effects as well such as; a new lighting system, weather system, water effects, and triangular geometry—all a first for the series (at the time).Conclusion:Tomb Raider III does for Tomb Raider what The Sims: Livin’ Large did for The Sims. It’s basically more of the same with slight upgrades here and there.PROS:+Challenging and rewarding+Nice effects+Variety of weapons, levels, moves, outfits, and vehicles+Good Boss battles+Lara’s Mansion (Training Level)CONS:-Sometimes too challenging-New crawling move slows down the pacing-Lots of urban environments that feel a bit out of place-Tedious vehicle sections that suffer from bad controls-Vague story."

,Not Recommended,225320,14383335,"Posted: 8 February, 2015",all,tiguilherman,"Back in 1999 and already baffled (in a good way) by the first 2 games of the franchise, I finally bought the 3rd part of Lara Croft's (back then definitely the biggest name of the gaming industry) saga for the Sony Playstation, expecting to get that same fix of what I always loved about Core Design's masterpiece of a franchise and then some.Things, however, didn't go as smoothly as expected.Back then I couldn't get into the game because of its difficulty but I thought it was my fault for - as a kid - sucking at it. I could make progress with time and patience (some levels took me over a month), but it was simply too much of an effort and little fun to pay it off.So I put the game on my waiting list and finally, in 2015 - 16 years later - I went to give it another try and boy, was I disappointed: my displeasure with it didn't change one bit.What actually changed was the maturity in my approach to it, as well as the acquired ability to really be able to identify what went wrong with it.Ok, so TR1 was the big sensation of 1996 and everybody who played it back then know that. Absolutely tremendous in every way.TR2 brought along in 1997 a series of innovations: A more mature approach to the character of Lara itself, with more cutscenes and a more elaborate plotline, different kinds of locations (as the picturesque Venice, a dive in the deep ocean into the Maria Doria, the tibetan foothills, and so on), the introduction of urban scenarios (which in TR2 are not bad at all), new weapons, the clever use of lighting (flares) and so on. Everything underlined by a great level design that offered, in my opinion, a very fair challenge. How could you not like it?The third part, however, tried to surpass the second one not with new resources or a new approach (like TR2 did after TR1), but with (little) flash over substance. It was simply the sequel nobody asked for: More of the same with a twist of lemon. Of course, I won't deny that people back then (like myself) wanted more than anything else just to have more fun with good old Lara, especially after 2 very successful games. But to craft an entire game only on that urge for quantity, and not quality, could only lead to a bland piece of software with a very short lifespan. And that's exactly what happened.I will tell you why:The developers tried to enhance even more the gameplay and challenge by making more intricate puzzles, which, along with the atmosphere (art direction+soundtrack), basically composes the core of the game. The rest is - let's be honest - simply decorative. The level design and some ideas of TR3 are not bad at all, I admit it, and the game may look good (or harmless) in a first impression - when you, for example, are testing the game on a store or in a friend's place (until you eventually buy it).As you play however, the game engine starts to show its age, and you notice that some platforming puzzles are simply too clumsily implemented. There are some ledges you can't even see right, and back then this was even worse, as it was enhanced by the lower resolution.The intention was good, of course. If you are making a sequel you SHOULD bring something new to the table, but they simply didn't have the tools to do it and did it anyway.The result was a very confusing level design filled with alot of unnecessary frustration. Actually this wouldn't be so bad if they also didn't punish you so harshly for failing, which leads me to the other big fault of this game:It's HARD in a very unfair way. 90% of the times you missed a jump, you will either fall inadvertently to your death, or into a river full of piranhas with no possibility of getting out, or drown in quicksand (btw how that happens in the level ""Crash Site"" is just laughable), and the list goes on.ALL of them game-breaking situations, which means you WILL have to load a save. You will then, of course, be♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and fall into one of these 2 situations:1. If you didn't save, be ready to ALT+F4 in anger and do something else, because the game's a long ways of being atmospheric or instigating enough to entertain you to play the same thing all over again until the part that you failed. It's a crude form of challenge, a blatant hardship with absolutely no reward apart from the dim ray of hope that things will get eventually better until the end of the game, which never really happens.2. If you, on the other hand, are a good scout and save your game every 5 minutes because you're no fool and already felt from the very beginning that you will have to do that if you wanna avoid frustration,you were right. Congratulations.Thing is, that is still annoying and it still totally breaks the flow of the game (or any game, for that matter). In the end, you can't really enjoy the experience because you're so worried with death and looking everytime over your shoulders for the next trick the developers - for sure - will throw at you. Be it some piece of the ceiling falling over your head with no chance of a timely, spontaneous escape or being crushed by a rolling boulder that just fell from someplace you can't see and didn't give you nearly enough time to even notice that something unusual was about to happen.You will just see Lara dead.So believe me you will be loading your save ALOT before you finally get that jump or notice that they purposedly put the exit of a tunnel in that dark part where the camera (which was always awful) doesn't go, just to keep you wondering in frustration.The game's full with these bad jokes.What they wanted with this I don't know, but if they figured this was going to be fun, they were wrong.Relevant sidenote: Every vehicle mechanic in this game is broken aswell.So that's the gameplay for you, one of the 2 attractions of a typical adventure with Lara. The next one is the atmosphere: As far as the art direction goes, this game unfortunately doesn't even come close either to the mysterious and instigating environments of the first game or to the aliveness and freshness of the plethora of different scenarios of the 2nd part. The London stages I found particulary boring and uninspired, as well as the Area 51 levels in Nevada. This engine simply wasn't designed to do urban stuff. It feels and it plays awkward, even for 1998's standards.On top of it, the story is really generic. I know the story was never a strong point in TR games, but this one's simply doesn't give a rat's♥♥♥♥♥either about content nor value.Something a teenager could write in 10 minutes.What's really bad, though, is its presentation. There's absolutely NO fill-in as to why Lara suddenly appeared in Nevada after being 2 minutes ago in London, for example. Everything seems like a poor excuse to shove more levels down your throat - again, the hopeless, pointless struggle of quantity against quality.This entire game was actually more suited to be an expansion of TR2, and the devs actually do a really bad job of hiding this truth, beginning with the couldn't-be-more-generic title of the game: ""Adventures Of Lara Croft"". Are you serious?The soundtrack, however, is not bad at all, despite not actually being something you could call a soundtrack. It's more like short bursts of music that inspire mystery and suspense, following the tradition of TR1 and TR2, which is never a bad thing. A nice cherry to a cake that unfortunately has a bad taste.All in all, if you're a completist like me and you have a strong motivation of playing every single game of the franchise, be it for nostalgia or just for the sake of knowledge, go for it and be warned.But if you just played TR1 and TR2 back then and just wanna have some fun for old time's sake, go play those games again, because this one doesn't make the cut.If you never played anything from the franchise, I beg of you to STAY AWAY. You will ruin your first impression of it. If you know what's good for you, start with TR1."

,Recommended,225320,26017269,"Posted: 13 October, 2016",all,DannyRodriguez,"This was a hard one. Compared to the two first games, this one was twice as difficult to complete. I think the main reason for that is the amount of backtracking you have to do in maze-like areas. Not that I mind much because the levels are very well designed and the movement has also been improved this time around.And the best part is that this time the music, cutscenes and dialogue work properly without any problems whatsoever! Having music really added a lot to the experience and I'm very happy this isn't going to be a problem any more in the future games.The camera was annoying in this game though, a lot of the time it wouldn't point to where I wanted it to and in previous games when the camera gave you a cinematic view of the level it was to show you something important. That isn't necessarily the case this time which got really irritating as I was playing.And I still won't give it a pass on vehicle control. You thought the snowmobile section was frustrating in the second one? Wait till you try the kayak.Don't read on if you don't want MINOR SPOILERS for the ending cutscene:There's one thing I have to mention though, something that really stuck out to me. In the end cutscene Lara shoots an unsuspecting and unarmed chopper pilot.That is the most shocking and cold blooded thing I have ever seen a video game hero do. I think I understand what happened here: It was just a stupid gag. She's hot, he's stupid and smiles at a hot chick and she shoots him and takes the chopper. I suppose they weren't overly concerned with lore and the psychology of the character at the time.But she didn't need to do it. She's knocked people unconscious before in previous games and all these people were pretty much victims of that spider doctor guy and his evil scheming. The whole thing really stuck out to me and seemed out of place for the character.To give you an analogy, imagine playing Uncharted and Drake is escaping from some temple or whatever and he sees the only car around for a 100 miles. He sneaks up on the driver standing by the side of the road taking a leak, comically taps him on the shoulder and as he turns around he's immediately shot in the face by a smirking Nathan Drake."

I tried to play TR 1 & 2, and it was a pain. Most of the Tomb Raider series have their own places in history, and are pretty fun games, but they also all have their quirks, and difficulties. The controls are a pain, and the menu system is garbage. To start a new game you have to rotate this gimmicky menu system to a passport. All of the settings for video and such were also done in an external application.If you want to get them running on a modern system, it's a pain, and they won't look that great. I don't mean just old graphics. When I finally got this to run, there were these odd lines running through various things on the screen. It didn't even want to launch at first. I kept getting the error ""Failed to initialize. Please run setup."" Setup isn't even in the folder. They didn't even include the external application to adjust the application settings, that is pretty much required. Every time I run one of these old games this company has put on Steam, my oppinion of them lowers.I don't know if the company still has the source code for this game, but they did NOTHING to fix any bugs, or update the games to run a bit better. This is just an attempt to get more money out of an old game, with next to zero effort. They just uploaded old copies. Don't buy this. Pick up an old copy off fleabay, or at a garage sale. My oppinion will stay the same until they bother to actually try to update this so it runs on the modern systems that many who are buying it have.They should just open source it, because they clearly don't care about their user's experieces enough to update the code themselves."

It is not really welcome considering how clucky the game is.I feel I managed to survive the game only due to being TR veteran. The puzzles are pretty badly designed.

For instance, pulling a lever in one area to open a door in another makes perfect sense in an ancient tomb designed to protect the secrets inside, but makes no sense on a London rooftop.I have no problem with the game's designers including the urban settings when in moderation, I just wish they had created the gameplay to suit.Another problem I have noticed with this game is the occasional nonsensical puzzle element. I can't help wondering if these were included as a cynical way of selling strategy guides back in the day.The story is also worse this time around feeling a little disjoined from the whole.The series feels like it's running out of steam at this point with the developers just phoning it in. While the graphics, sounds, and animations have been improved, the same basic gameplay problems persist, namely the inane fixed camera that tends to show repeated close ups of Lara's backside rather than the ledge you are trying to jump to.Still, I did enjoy this game, but  less so than the first two instalments.7/10"

An example of this is once you complete the area you are in, you have the freedom to go where you wish to next. The puzzles are very well thought out, and require you to either be quick or make no mistake, and with the return of quite a few classic enemies, weapons and mechanics, e.g losing your weapons, even secrets. One thing i don't really like with this game is that the controls are kinda sluggish, but get past that little problem and this game is worth the buy. this is for those who love action, with a healthy dose puzzles and brainteasersall in all, i give this game an 8/10"

Tomb Raider II was the very first game I ever picked up for PC when I was around 8. Both my parents played it, and my mom was the first one to beat it. Needless to say, I'm a huge Tomb Raider fan.Tomb Raider III feels like an anomaly in the series that I just can't figure out. It has cool places to go, a good structure, and was the first game to impliment the crouch and sprint features. Off the top of my head, it appears to run on the same engine as Chronicles and Last Revelation, but has the same menu system as I and II. Tomb Raider III is something of a transitional game, and is also the last game until Anniversary to feature Lara's Manor. That being said, Tomb Raider III's level design, of all the games, is the most convoluted and elaborate, with the first level ""Jungle"" featuring no explanation for why Lara was there when you first start playing, and being the longest first mission to solve out of all other games, completely negating any linear tutorial-like qualities for a very open and hard to figure out level design. Unfortunately, this is a trend for all levels (Or at least most) in Tomb Raider III, so I recommend having a walkthrough ready if it's your first time playing. If you want something better to ease you into Tomb Raider, II is the way to go, with the most gradual and steady build in level difficulty of all the other Tomb Raider games. Of course, if you want the best story, you want Last Revelation.That being said, Tomb Raider III, at the very least, is still better than Legends, Anniversary (which butchered I), and of course, Tomb Raider (2013), which was more of a spit int he face to the series than anything else."

I also remember having to beat Area 51 normally despite cheating, because you needed to get your pistols back to do a level skip without exploding into several very polygonal Lara bits.Years later, I got the TR 1+2+3 bundle on GOG when it was on sale and decided to beat them all (and my disc copy of TR4) without cheating like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.After beating all the classic TR games thoroughly, I can say this is still my favorite classic TR game. It just seems to have the best variety and combination of things, not to mention the non-linear level select world map thing."

76561198042043342,Recommended,225320,24726499,"Posted: 5 August, 2016",all,machoo,"So after replaying all of the games in the series I have to say this is my favourite. It's not perfect, and it is very unforgiving in places but for me there are so many things to enjoy in this game. I should probably mention any bias I have here. Tomb raider 1 and 2 were my first games on the PS1, so this was the first game I really followed the build up and development of. I remember buying magazines the and seeing all the new screenshots, and playing the Area 51 demo where you randomly jump off the tower over the fence instead of finding the articfact.So for the review bit. The game improves visually on the first two, significantly in the PC version, it might sound strange to say but I find the game to be beautiful in it's own way. The vibrance of parts of the India, Pacific Islands and the first Nevada level is refeshing and the sunset tone of the last two Nevada levels are visually very pleasing. Lara herself looks good, the last of the classic raiders where she looks somewhat normal in game and didn't have two massive ballons slapped on her chest. Her ponytail flickering bothered me when the camera came in too close behind her but that's a minor issue.The background audio for each of the levels enhances the feeling of being in those places, with sounds of the jungle, tribal drums, snakes and crickets etc., it should be noted the sound quality isn't amazing (noticably worse quality than TR4 or TR5). Lara's voice is how I will always expect it to be, mature sounding, non-whiny, unlike TR4, TR5 and the reboot. Remixes of the classic Tomb Raider music appear in the levels. The India remix is probably some of my favourite music ever from a video game and the military style remix is well done and used suitably.Gameplay wise it is the same block-based system of old, and if you don't like that then it's not the game for you. I will say that it is a system that takes time to get used to but once you do it's not all that bad. New moves such as crawling and monkeyswing might seem minor but they add to the realism of Lara's movemove through levels much like her being able to climb ladders introduced in TR2. One of my issues with the newer games is that Lara never feels very weighted, she magically flies further forward if the jump is longer and her place in the environement always feels a little unreal. In the older games there is no assist for jumps, you just die if it is wrong, that might sound harsh but it is the challenge of platforming that makes up a large part of the games enjoyment. Combat is as always not a strong point of the earlier games, it is something you get used to though, and there is still something about the the sound of drawing those pistols and her just holing them that brings enjoyment. One big plus for me with this game was the level design. You often pass by earlier/later stages of a level which adds to the environements somewhat. I never really felt as though I was backtracking although you do pass through certaina areas numerous times. The non-linear approach to some of the levels is also refreshing, and there are still parts of the game I haven't seen. You can also play the middle three levels in any order adding to your choice. Collectables, in the form of secrets, are present. Some of these are very challenging to find, but this really added to the game for me, and generally they are built into the levels well.Story wise the game is a little thin. There is something there but it's really just as an excuse to send Lara off to these locations. Her interactions with various characters are fun though and allow for Lara's wit and some personality to come through. Settings wise, I found nearly all of the 5 sections enjoyable. London was the exception (mainly the two middle levels) but they all have their own looks. There are ruins, I'm not sure there is an actual Tomb, but it fits in with her thirst for adventure.Overall this is a game I get a lot of enjoyment from. I have played through it 3 times in the last year, the last time just for enjoyment (once you have played through once and don't die at every turn the game is a lot more fun to play) taking in a lot more of the visuals/audio mention in this review. Most definitely my favourite of the series."

The first 5 old games are good each game adds new mechanics this game adds sprinting, monkey climbing and a few more. New weapons in three include the rocket launcher and mp5. This is also one of the few games that let you do things in your choice of order after you complete India. Tip choose Nevada first you loose your items in the second Nevada lvl.

This is about on par with Tomb Raider 2.Theatmospherein this game is just beautiful for 1998. It goes from the lush jungle of India to the deserts and prisons of Nevada, to the mysterious and tropical islands of the South Pacific, to the urban underground of London, and finally to the brutal and icy Antarctica.This game hassomething for every Tomb Raider fan.Like more traditional tomb raiding? India is your place. Like exciting urban environments? Then there's London and Nevada for you!I will say that this game isVERY difficultand confusing. The puzzles' solutions often involve VERY subtle hints that you need to take note of, and extremely well disguised secrets, ladders, and monkey-bars.Thelengthof this game is tremendous. Many people consider The Last Revelation to be the longest Tomb Raider. However, I disagree. This Tomb Raider has by far the longest levels. They can take up to 3 hours for a single level if you're playing this blindly! In total, I've spent about 33 hours on this game. However, my final statistics say it was only 22 hours (I believe that they don't take into account the time you played before you die without saving).Overall, I'd give this game a solid 9/10.All the original Tomb Raider games are great (except for TLR in my opinion), but this is definitely one of the better ones if the locations in this game intrigue you and you're up for a challenge equivalent to a  black man's lower zone:looong and hard ;)))"
