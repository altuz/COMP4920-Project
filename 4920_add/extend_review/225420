It has a few quirks, and is artificially difficult in ""normal"" mode, but it is still playable, once you learn how to use the Metros.I tend to play it with my own rule set in sandbox mode, and I use that same ruleset in multiplayer mode with a close friend.  As a result, a ""day"" lasts six hours! o.OWe enjoy the game for it's challenge, and yet the relaxed atmosphere and pace."

The goal is to transport people across a city in multitude of ways. The real challenge comes from efficency and you can really grind down in to the details. You can change the layout of the city by creating new roads (one way, avenues, with or without sidewalks or bus lanes) or you can adjust the individual time tables (frequency, what type of vehicle, times etc.) of busses and other transports.It's a good deal of fun, and the simulation is really good. I can only recommend for those who liked TTD."
,Not Recommended,225420,12467206,"Posted: 12 October, 2014",all,Dahl,"This game is great for those of us who enjoy just to manage the transport aspect of a city, and for those of us who love efficiency. The game is not a city builder in the traditional sense--you can build roads and expand your cities around them, but that isn't the primary focus of the game. That being said, there are some pretty serious challenges to the game, and the mechanics as well. I do have several concerns with the game in general, but I'll get to those in a bit.Here's a breakdown:The good:-Seriously challenges you to be efficient-Engine is good-Large variety of possibilites, you can make your own city, workshop is available too-Variety of transportation methods-Building engine is easy to use and coolBad:-Game is DLC-Based-Stops are unrealistic---vehicles leave without being full when people are obviously running to the stop.-Cars are stupid: they do not take advantage of multiple lanes going to the same place.-Height of buildings are not realistic (It maxes out at about 35 stories).-When building new roads, game is prone to developing tons and tons of elementary and high schools, forcing the player to demolish them so houses can be  built.-People are stupid: all vehicles yield to them--ALWAYS.-Traffic lights make no sense-No easy way to make central hubs.-No control over individual lanes in roads.-No right turn on red.-No arrows.All you really need to get money in a game is one good Metro line, then you can just hit fast forward for tons of money.I like the game, but it gets boring and repetitive very quickly. Even with all of the DLC, it's really easy to just fall into the same rut over and over again. The game does a good job for those of us who enjoy city management, however that aspect of the game is fairly half-baked and automated. The content leaves a lot to be desired.I do not reccommend the game to any of my friends."
,Not Recommended,225420,11897779,"Posted: 28 August, 2014",all,Teath,"Love the idea of city-building and management games, especially when transport is involved. But as much as I want to love this game, I simply cannot, because its controls and mechanics are infuriating and extremely frustrating.It is so damn annoying to do anything in this game. After an hour I was convinced that the game is deliberately doing everything the way I don't want it to, from camera movement to adding bus stops to setting schedules to building these damn metro tracks from hell that never go the way you want them to. It's amazing how counter-intuitive the controls are.It is extremely hard to see the roads. Underground view is not really underground view, it's ground view + metro tracks, which makes both roads AND metro tracks impossible to see. Finding your bus stops is even worse, since their tiny transparent icons blend nicely into the background. Conclusion: You can't see anything. It all blends together.Building metro tracks in this game is just the worst thing ever. They never remember or understand the elevation you chose. They don't want to connect to each other. If they do, they do it wrongly. Connecting a track to an underground depot is impossible, since the depot track is under the depot, rendering it invisible, so when you try to connect it, the track decides it now has to surface. After 10 minutes of this farce, I closed the game, promising myself to never play this again.And this could be fixed by a patch. Only that it won't be, because the developers are adding new cosmetic DLC instead of actually fixing the broken game.I'd love to play and like this game, but I can't, because every time I do, it leaves me frustrated and angry at it."
,Recommended,225420,20924578,"Posted: 2 February, 2016",all,GaborBartal,"For those who come from the newer game from the devs,Cities: Skylineswondering what this previous games of theirs is like: In short, CiM2 is [still] the best public transport simulator out there.InCities: Skylinesyou get a way bigger map area, better and faster engine, more possibilities for building a city - but its public tr. system is simplified, whereas CiM2 is completely built around that with lots more options.Pros:Schedules: Creation schedules is incredible, you can tailor each line to demand. Also worth setting different lines from a same depot to leave with a delay (e.g. fist buses leaving each line at 4:30,4:35,4:40 respectively, for instance) to avoid queuing, jams, etc on the roads nerby. Don't forget to buy enough vehicles for every depot, for servicing. Don't buy too many either because they won't fit in and just deteriorate over time, waiting on the streets.Street types:: Building roads is incredible, you can curve the range of different types (avenues, one-way streets-bus lanes, and a large combination of these) at any angle and arc, more diversely than in Cities:Skylines.Vehicle parameters:Acceleration, capacity, maintenance cost, fuel consumption, attractiveness.You can choose to invest in attractive vehicles early on to increase usage. You can choose smaller capacity vehicles running more frequently, or big ones running paced out.Finances:You can set driver/reparimen/inspector wages (and nr. of inspectors). The sweet spot for inspectors tends to be 11 credit wages, and an amount so that they catch ~33% of freeloaders. This yields maximum income. The income from inspection nicely balances the loan payment amount usuallyCons:Loans:This is almost like cheat. will have almost unlimited money: You take a huge loan, and set a long nr of installments. It means you can build an infrastructure of metros straight away and guarantee decent income while never actually repaying it (as it may take ~50 in-game weeks or more). Have the decency to work with the 100k starting money, and also don't burn it on metros or trams. Start with buses and replace them later with trams/metros.Campaign:The game jumps you into ""Berlin"", a huge city with a lot of tasks to do. It should start with a small village. Also the campaign scenarios are short, and not really diverse. Custom, free, Steam workshop user-created maps are great to try but offer no missions. Still it's fun to play this game as sandbox, like Cities: Skylines is also, basically.Performance:On larger maps or a large nr. of lines the game likes quite a bit. It is actually caused by the overlay (floating icons for vehicles, stops, lines, depots) which can be turned off but cumbersom (individually).Also it is heavily CPU based, so even an 8-core AMD 8350 struggles on 3x speed (you don't play on 1x usually). When the CPU can't handle more, 3x feels like 1,5x. Not necessarily FPS drop but simulation speed is sluggish.Vehicles:While there is a nice selection of vehicles, there is one ultimate one in each category, meaning I never actually tried most of the buses/trams as they are inferior.Gameplay:While I put some 100+ hours into the game (therefore safe to say it is addictive) it is a grind sometimes. Also can't seem to change the default schedule to something better (2 hour frequency is really bad).AI:The citizens very rarely glitch into circling some vehicle at a crosswalk when too many of them want to cross the road.Road upgrade:Unfortunately, as good and diverse the road types are, you cannot upgrade them, but need to demolish and rebuild.Ticket prices:The game allows you to set ticket prices for vehicle type vs zones, and for single ticket and passes. While this is great to be flexible, it also becomes a grind. Basically a huge table of 6*5*2 cells that you continually need to monitor and update because as you build new lines, demand changes and hence the prices (really complicated system, you will see. The game gives you hints whether a price is below or above the normal. Per cell. With an alert at notification bar every time there is a single cell (ticket combination) that deviates moderately. Ouch.)Stop interest:The circle area of a stop that you place (which attracts only the buildings inside) is a little disappointing. A better solution would be the method in Train Fever where citizens will decide how much they need to walk, and they still choose a stop even if it's far, if it means they still get from A to B faster (that game starts from horse carriages are though).Overall I greatly recommend the game, with its flaws there is still a ton of plus, and is a fantastic simulation for anyone loving traffic, public transportation, or just plain management games! Support a small company :)"

The fun of the real-world cities has been replaced with a big soulless city. I did not really get the hang of the new mechanics, it was a bit more difficult than Cities in Motion 1. If you are expecting the kind of arcade-style game play of Cities in Motion 1 I would not recommend this game. Also what is going on with the prices for the DLC? They are so expensive!

CIM2 retains some of the themes but rearchitects the engine and simulation.  I eagerly picked it up, played through a little bit, enjoyed what I saw but found some of the controls difficult and frustrating, so it languished for awhile.Then I started reading all of the excitement about Cities: Skylines in its prerelease phase, saw the simularities in the look and feel of C:S, and thought I'd take another look.  Applying myself a little more, I found I was able to overcome some (but not all) of the frustration with the user interface of CIM2 and in belated retrospect, it is a very enjoyable simulation.I'm planning to finish the campaign (and in a sale, maybe pick up some DLC) before moving on to Cities:Skylines, which I fully expect to build and expand on the CIM2 experience."

The graphics are well done, the timetable system is decent and the fact that you can build extra ""bus-only"" roads is very interesting. However, the online mode needs some work; you can't see the others' view in Coop, so there's no way of telling what someone is talking about. Also, the passengers and the traffic are not sync'ed, so where one player sees a huge traffic jam, the other might see an empty street. The game is still very good and for fans of tycoon games, it's worth it. Just be ready to deal with some minor issues."

,Recommended,225420,12732696,"Posted: 1 November, 2014",all,ro,"Cities in Motion is a game about transporting people within a single city. You are doing this by building trams, buses, metros and boats. This is in difference to games like Railroad Tycoon, Transport Tycoon and most recently Train Fever where you transport people and goods between cities.The base premise of the game works well with a well executed economy and people having regular destinations and are able to use several different lines to get to those destinations.The game offers a pretty limited set of trams, metro trains, buses and boats. As far as I can make out if you want more you have to buy DLC:s.The game has a campaign that is reasonable and also acts as a tutorial. It is not very special though.Although it is possible to build a profitable tram network, if you want to make as much money as possible, it is almost always best to borrow money to build a couple of metro lines, which will make you enough money to build more metro lines. This makes the game a little bit more boring since not all options are viable.The ingame time is something pretty confusing, since all lines take strange amount of time. It is easy to build 12 hour lines even in quite small city. And passengers are often quite happy to go to work in lines that take several hours. It leaves the impression that people in these cities are spending all of their time transporting themselves."

,Recommended,225420,8551852,"Posted: 4 January, 2014",all,Life Pilgrim,"Cities in Motion 2 is a well made game. The city grows dynamically with night/day cycle but no weather.You're in charge to develop and maintain the various cities public transportation. In game this includes: Buses, Trams, Trolleys (Busses with overhead electric lines), boats, and trains(metro which includes subway). Each individual in the game's world is given a category among others: pensioner, businessman, student, tourist, white collar worker and blue collar worker. Each of these categories has their own public transportation preferences and different service level expectancies. So you try to cater for their different needs while trying to make the company profitable to further expand your services. All in all it's quite a detailed game. The learning curve can be a little bit daunting at first but highly rewarding once everything has been figured out. Attention to details and thoughtful design (the head developer was a female so attention to details and thoughtfulness are superb) made this game an enjoyable one to play especially online in cooperation mode. Highly recommended for family LAN game party. This is one of those games that has a little bit education in it for your children while still being genuinely fun to play for an adult."

It's fun, addictive, and kills time rather nicely.However, let's start off with the first and most glaring flaw of the game: Lack of a proper tutorial. There is a tutorial, but it's very basic and fails to explain anything beyond your first basic bus route on roads that already exist, leaving the rest of the game's mechanics a complete mystery.Second is the gameplay itself. It just feels clunky and unintuitive. When you design a system, you need to get it right the first time, or you'll be ****ed and have to scrap it and do it all over again. There is also zero capability to change said system once it's already in place.Third is the UI. It's clunky, unintuitive, all over the place, and you have no idea what any of the buttons actually DO. That is, until you accidentally replace that one apartment building with a train station.And finally, there isn't really much to DO, other than ""don't go bankrupt"". In similar games like OpenTTD (Transport Tycoon), even if you don't have an AI, you still feel like you're accomplishing something. You start off with a few cities and industries which are in desperate need of connections between each other. But in this game, you essentially start off in a city without any problems whatsoever. Everyone seems to be getting around rather happily, without any congestion of any sorts. Sure, the town is missing public transit, but it seems to be of little concern to its citizens.You can expand your cities by building roads, but in the majority of the cases, there isn't any room for any more roads. Every spot is already taken up by other roads, or water.Instead of fixing the numerous bugs and issues this clearly unfinished and unpolished game has, the developers instead opt to release more DLC. The game could've been so much better if the developers had spent a few weeks polishing the game.If you're a fan of games like this, consider buying it during a sale. 20 euros is way too much to justify buying this."

However since this game is a people transport game I suppose I can ignore that fact. However I cannot ignore the fact that after you plop the stations and watch the buses go... there is nothing else to do... I have played OTTD (Open Transport Tycoon Deluxe) and I can be on it for hours, mainly due to the fact you have TRAINS. In CiM2 I play with some metros which oversimplify the game generally. Also, you'd have to pay at least $5 more to get a decent amount of trains or verierity, since the regular game has just 2.This puts me into the main problem of the game, the game lacks a worthwhile amount of content. You get about 11 vehicles in total (14 or so if you preordered like me) and probably 150 props and buildings. Thats it. The devs are working to cram more vehicles, but only if you pay $5 for 5 vehicles. It is unknown if the devs want to make a building pack as well.Something I can give it credit is its road system, it has a really  flexible road system which includes from roads, expressways, and one way roadsGraphics:Odd, the graphics/color sceme might not be for everyone, I had mod it in order to suit my tastes. Modeling and texturing are fair but not world-class.6/10Content:As I said before, there isn't much beyond the 150 buildings and props, and the handful of 11 vehicles in the regular version, the DLC adds some  20 more but the cost of that alone can buy the game probably twice.4/10Gameplay:Gameplay is well, like it is, you place a line from point A to B, and hope to make as many stops as possible to make more money. It generally thereafter is just making sure you have sufficient vehicles and depots to store them. Making grids with the roads is a hazzard, since the roads don't snap with each other in order to make crossings, thus resulting in you making grids road by road until you have a grid. After all is done and said, there is pretty much nothing else to do.5/10Rating:5/10My Final Opinion:Don't buy this at full price, or better yet, buy CiM1, you'd have more fun than this dead end game.

76561198019351574,Recommended,225420,11536994,"Posted: 3 August, 2014",all,Syque,"If this is the type of game you'd enjoy, CIM 2 is truly mesmerizing.  At the same time, there are many things that stop this game from being as great as it could have been.  As you can see I've put many hours into it, so I thought it deserved a review.  This review is designed for people who are already sold on the concept of running a virtual transit agency and are more interested in an opinion how it's been executed in this game.In my opinion, here are the pro's and con's of CIM 2 compared to CIM 1.PROS:1)Way bigger cities than CIM 1.  One map can provide many hours of gameplay.2)Easy to make maps that are true to real life cities with the ""maps4cim"" fan tool.  Recreating a real city is a huge endeavor but some really brilliant maps have been created with it.3)Although the timetables are more fiddly than I'd like them to be, they're still an improvement over CIM 1.  Instead of messing with the timetables I just set the same service frequency 24/7.  For example, once an hour.  In CIM 1, it was much more painful to make sure your vehicles stay spaced out, and I would avoid modifying my lines as long as possible to avoid the pain of dispatching my vehicles evenly.4)No lag even on large cities.  In CIM1, performance bogs down with a medium to large network, which is much smaller than the largest networks you can build with no problems in CIM2.5)You can expand the city yourself if you find you're flush with cash and need a new project.CONS:1)Can't color code metro lines!  In CIM 1, the Line statistics Plus mod allows you to individually color lines which is awesome for metros.  Anyone with an unusual attraction to metro systems knows that one of the most interesting things about a metro system is analyzing how all the colored lines meet up for transfers on the map.2)Ticket pricing is annoying and adds no value to the gameplay experience.  There are 5 transit types, 6 with monorails, and each transit type has 7 types of tickets.  So you have to fiddle with up to 42 different ticket prices on a regular basis.  What cims consider a reasonable fare for each ticket changes frequently.3)The art direction in CIM2 is much lower quality than in CIM1.  The CIM2 home and loading screens are ugly and use garish colors while the screens in CIM1 are very pleasing and interesting.  Buildings and colors are nicer looking in CIM 1.  The music in CIM 2 is not as good; I turned the music off and instead downloaded the SimCity 2013 soundtrack to listen to while playing.  The UI for CIM1 is much easier to use, and CIM2 text is often difficult to read.  Only the vehicles in CIM2 get proper artistic love.4)The more complex your network gets, the weirder your cims choose their paths.  I get around this by avoiding doubleservice in areas beyond connecting points and using the ruleset editor to make sure all vehicles have 100% passenger attractiveness.5)Random crashes and no autosave.  I've had a few instances where I played for 5 hours straight and forget to ever save, then the game crashes.  Then I ragequit and don't play for several weeks.NEUTRAL:1)Metro lines are easier to place than CIM 1 once you get the hang of it.  You can make bendy tracks and underground stations don't take up any space above ground.  In CIM 1 an above ground building may need to be destroyed to build a station entrance.  The tradeoff here is that train stations are less visually pleasing than they were in CIM 1.  Instead of watching passengers take the stairs down to the platforms, they get in a magical teleporter from the steet to the platform.2)expanding on the above, the ease of placement is almost too easy in CIM2.  There's no challenge at all in building metro lines since you have variable height placement and the street grid above has no impact on placement.  In CIM1, you're limited to only 3 levels of track at intersections as well as the restrictions of the buildings and streets above ground.  CIM2 placement is very easy and CIM1 is challenging, though frustrating at times.  I think the best way to solve this would be to add geology/geography as a bigger placement factor.  For example, make it more expensive to tunnel through bedrock than softer soil, and more expensive to tunnel under buildings than under roads or empty space.  Also, make above ground tracks cheaper than underground so there's an incentive to choose wisely between the two.  This is certainly out of scope for CIM 2 but one can dream for CIM 3 :)IN SUMMARY:If you're more interested in an arcade-style game that's visually pleasing, go with CIM 1.  If you're looking for a game with greater simulation depth, more network flexibility, and you're not terribly turned off by bad art, choose CIM 2.  Both games are great in their own right.  I wouldn't recommend either game to anyone, and which game is better depends on the individual's preferences more than one game being any ""better"" than the other.  If you think you'll probably like both games, play CIM1 till you get bored, then play CIM2."

CM2 really has a problem with the second of these. For example, the victory conditions of the campaign maps are ""Have x% coverage"". Unfortunately for the player, ""coverage"" means nothing like the English word ""coverage,"" and its precise meaning is never explained. This makes the game artificially difficult. Despite these gripes, the game still is entertaining.While entertaining, and definitely worth the $5 I paid for it, I can't bring myself to recommend this game. This is due in part to the designer's attitude towards DLC ($5 for more busses?) and how its patches focus on niche markets (Mac-only issues, Linux compatibility) despite persistent and well-documented bugs that affect everyone.TL;DR: Engaging and entertaining, yet buggy, has awful UI, and is worse than an EA game for DLC."

Half the game mechanics don't work and the cities feel sterile and artificial, because they are. CiM 1 or Cities: Skylines, both of which are by the same dev, are significantly better and more stable. In this game, you can't build a proper line half the time and structure placement is at best wonky. The tutorial is a joke; I couldn't even finish it because the game didn't detect that I completed the requirements. Another thing is that every single line has to route back to a depot, so you have vehicles returning at 99% condition to get serviced.

The underground view is bad. The system for drawing out lines is based on a pen tool, rather than a pencil tool to make a photoshop analogy, which is theoretically nice for drawing curves and whatnot... but it just doesn't work. It needs to be reworked or redone from scratch, it is just too difficult to use. I know where I want to draw the lines, I just cannot do it. The underground view is bad. There need to be more view/transparency options and if they do exist, they need to be more readily accessible.So being as how this is a game about making subways laying subway lines is so frustrating as to be nearly impossible, this game is a fail.On the note of it being a detailed sim, there was a strange choice to make all lines start and end at depots- busses trains and trolleys alike. This doesn't make sense, as most real world transit lines do not start and end at depots..The visuals are good. Fix the metro laying tool and the weird depot system and I'll change this review to positive."

76561198282827638,Not Recommended,225420,31597922,Posted: 7 May,all,sffc,"tl;dr: Get Cities: Skylines instead.  It has transit tools rivaling those in CiM2, but they are much easier to use, and you get to build the network in your own city, not in someone else's city.  Also seriously consider C:S mods like Improved Public Transit (IPT) and Transport Lines Manager (TLM).Having played and enjoyed Cities: Skylines (C:S), I thought I would give Cities in Motion 2 (CiM2) a roll since it is from the same publisher.When you open a new game, you are presented with a very large city with a few demographics maps.  In order to add your first a bus line to the city, you have to first zoom in and place each and every individual bus shelter, and then you have to go back, navigate a web of confusing menus, and finally link the bus stops together with a bus line.  It can take 20-30 minutes of manual labor just to add line.  Subway lines are even worse.  For comparison, in C:S, you simply draw your loop on the city streets, and the game automatically places the bus shelters and routes the vehicles for you.I was initially drawn to the idea of customizing timetables, which you can't currently do in C:S.  I was thinking that timetables would allow me to do cool things like make timed transfers: have two infrequent buses that arrive at a particular transfer point together to reduce wait time.  Unfortunately, timetables in CiM2 are little more than a way for you to say, ""I want more buses on the line during rush hour and fewer in the middle of the day"".  I felt that I had very little control over the logistics of making timed transfers.Another subtle improvement in C:S that makes a huge difference is that you can assign colors to each bus line, but it appears you can't do that in CiM2.One problem in both C:S and CiM2 is that the speed of the buses is completely incompatible with the time-of-day tracker.  It takes half a day or more in game time for a passenger to travel across the city.  This completely defeats the purpose ""morning rush hour"" and ""evening rush hour"", because people who started in the morning are only first getting to their destinations by the time evening rolls around.  Another problem is that the simulation speed is simply too slow; in CiM2 particularly, I should be able to fast-forward super ultra fast and run an entire day in a matter of seconds, but even on my modern Macbook Pro with graphics card, the simulation speed is dog slow and I have to wait minutes to see if my new experimental transit line worked or not.In short, this here is really the fundamental flaw: instead of giving me a quick and nimble way to draw and experiment with transit lines, CiM2 puts a huge emphasis on visual details of the city that make the game incredibly cumbersome and not enjoyable to play."

,Not Recommended,225420,26132093,"Posted: 20 October, 2016",all,Leo Gaming,"In respect to those who give this game where credit is due, I find that this game can be pretty lacking in the field of public transit. In my eyes, a ""perfect"" public transit system is where all forms of transit follow three requirements: Convienence, Punctuality, and Reliability. Convience: To an extent, it's only the connection in this aspect that matters. If you are a regular transit commuter you will know that sometimes a train, bus, tram, plane, or even a ferry will run late by a few minutes to almost 15min-1hr. in this game this factor is taken accounted for, but it doesn't allow the player to have a convience factor. If a train station also doubles up as a bus station then it's easier to figure out your connection timing. From my time in San Fransico and Oakland the bus, tram, and trains would normally run on time and run inacordance together. That's what I hate about Cities in Motion 2 the most. Punctuality: With any transit system you want to see that your bus or any other form of transit runs on timme according to the schedule. CiM2 does catter to this by having correct departure times, but sometimes the vehicles will fall behind by a substantial nummber. Reliability: For a realiable transit system you must know that the bus driver will wait for you, CiM2 does not take this into account for any reason. In my  opinion for this game after playing 400+ hours of it, CiM2 is not for the modern day simulation world."

They just need more DLC and another transit mode or two and it would be great. Colossal Order is a great company yet small. They are very flexible and open and this game has more potential then it is now it could with some more publicity and minor improvements could get some people from the city builder market as well. This game would not replace Simcity or Cities XL but add another fun game to the libary for those people and aid them in their city building games. I play SImcity and my city runs so smothly thanks to some ideas from CIM2. Great game buy it. Ignore some of the not reccommended people out there they likely wanted it to be like CIM 1.

It has it's flaws but when compared to Sim City it really does shine in a way that forgives it of it's problems.=== The GOOD ===- Real traffic, real pedestrians, and their AI actually calculate's their travel all over the map. You don't have to wait in an area to see the traffic and pedestrians build up. You can zoom into a neighborhood and immediately see all the traffic. The city feels extremely lively. The masses feel real.- Beautiful game.- HUGE cities.- Lots of detail.- Great frame rate.- Satisfying.- Extremely unbalanced. But that's ok because you can use the ""Rule Editor"" in the Tools menu to change the capacity of all the vehicles, change the break down times, change how fast they are fixed in the repair shops, how many residents the city has, EVERYTHING. So you can re-balance your game however you like.- I increased the city population density by 500% and it was awesome! You need to have an extremely good PC because the game calculates each and every person's commute. I increased the capacity of trams to 200 people per tram (more realistic) and 600 people per metro train so it's more realistic and the whole game just got so much more fun. I had 2,000 people waiting at my busiest transit stations. I was so happy. It was everything sim city should have been.=== The Problems ===- My game crashes every hour. there's no auto save. But it does not crash on my brothers computer.- You can't upgrade current roads, you have to bulldoze them and when laying down the new road, if you curve or are off by 1 pixel the buildings around will be destroyed and you can't get them back.- There's no ""undo"" option. So if you accidentally destroy a building or are having trouble with rail connections (and you will a lot) you have to bulldoze everything and start over.- Trams can no longer do U-Turns on avenues like they used to.- The addition of depots is extremely limiting. ALL buses, metros, trams must start out and end at the same depot. So no more little bus routes.The team worked really hard on this game, and the assets are top notch. I feel like just 2 more years of development and this game can be fleshed out into a serious Sim City Competitor. If you have problems with the umbalanced gameplay, low vehicle capacity, short break down times, just change the stats in the Rule Editor and game on."

It teaches you how to make a bus line BUT not how to make money off of it. It's more like taking a college course than a game. I've had this game for about a year now. AND I finally was able to get into this long enough to notice you ain’t ever going to make money with the vehicles in the base game. If you don't buy the DLCs you are guarantee to go under.

Although more oriented towards transportation networks, that is more what I have been interested in anyways.  I am hoping the next generation fo this game includes more building models and also solve some of the few querks this game has.Overall, I give this game an 8.5/10.0"
,Not Recommended,225420,14218961,"Posted: 28 January, 2015",all,WhatF*ckRP,"I own both CiM1 and CiM2 and so far I have to say I enjoyed CiM1 a lot better.First of all let me begin by saying that CiM2 does have certain improvements over the first version, which includes:- Now you can build your own roads and expand the city;- Day/Night shift and timetable settings;- Ticket prices are now based on distance (or zones) rather than flat fare in CiM1;- More realistic graphics and city landscapes (for example now roads can be actually curly rather than in 8 directions only in CiM1).However there are many things which I do not enjoy about this game.- The game is pretty much DLC/community based. If you buy the base game you will find only 5 maps (including a tiny tutorial map) and very few vehicles. The metro, which is supposed to be the backbone of any serious city transportation system, only has 2 trains available and are pretty much the worst ones. All decent maps/vehicles come from either the community or paid DLCs. You don't get much from the base game.- Stupid depot system. Yes the vehicle depot is added in CiM2, which some people might consider it an improvement. However I find it too often that my depot becomes too full and too many scheduled departures missed.- Lack of tutorial. With so many new features added why not add a serious tutorial to explain the complicated features? CiM1 has, in my opinion, a very decent tutorial mission.- The construction of the metro is very troublesome. Maybe I'm wrong, but it's very difficult to construct an underground metro line within the city. The elevation just don't match. (In CiM2 you can adjust the elevation freely with your pageup/pagedown keys, while in CiM1 you only have 5 levels: 3 underground, ground level and elevated.) This problem is made worse by the underground depot, which I have never successfully connected to any underground line. So far 70% of my metro lines are either overhead or on the ground, and all depots are on the ground.In conclusion, while some people may cheer the new added features, I must say that I enjoyed CiM1 better than CiM2 even when I try hard to switch from 1 to 2. Would rather recommend version 1 to anyone who does not want to smash their computer and/or keyboard while playing a simulation game."

CiM was somewhat a fun game but lacking a lot in comparisson to Sim City 4 which is the holy grail for this genre. However a lot of these aspects have been improved in the second version of the game. Unfortunately a lot of the aspects have gotten far worse.Lets start with the city size. What is this? Cities counting 50.000 residents with full on highrise downtown? And of course you have to downgrade the people to this size. So we have mainlines with doubledecker busses carrying 30 people every hour? This is a simulation. And the year is 2014. How is it possible that no one has come as far as SC4 with it's regional play? I mean we have games now as vast and complex as GTA 5. A city sim with that kind of size shouldn't be such a big deal.The next thing is the DLC. This is the bigggest crime comitted in the world of gaming right now. You pay 20€ for a notreallyalotmorethanashity game like this. Which includes 5 different vehicles. And then you have to buy each new vehicle? for like 1€ each? That's 20€ easily just to get to a diversity of a city with 30 bus lines and a couple of suburban rail lines.And don't even let me get started on the depots! The busses should not go back to depot after each and every run. Not even trains or trams do that! This concept should be changed!Oh! Let's also not forget the bugs and bad simulator engine which causes flooding of vehicles on lines and sudenly causes a standstill in your city. Why did I even buy this?People should really start fighting for their right to a good quality games!

,Recommended,225420,9600448,"Posted: 22 March, 2014",all,[CX] Der Navigator,"I guess it's easy to hate on SimCity with this review. We can go on all day about how♥♥♥♥♥♥that game was, but that'd be praising Cities In Motion 2 on the account of it's main competitor being ****. I won't do that. Instead, I'll relate to another game. One that has a lot more love.I will relate this game to Transport Tycoon. Because this game is much more similar to that game in many respects.Like TT, Cities In Motion is a game about building transport systems. The scale is limited to a large city rather than a large land, and the cargo variety is minimized to just passengers, but for the rest, it's very much like TT. And that's kind of that.Beyond that, CiM2 has a lot of different stuff. You build stops and direct bus lines through them. One bus line may not yield much. But when that line links up to a different line, not necessarily a bus line, people along the second line will use the first line too if they need to go there. Passengers go places and your transport systems are there to help that be possible without needing to pick up a car.The roadbuilding is very free-form. Just click a point, and then another, and it'll connect them with a straight line. Click a third point, and it'll create a nice curve. Keep clicking new points and you have a scribble. Or a long line. Or a long curve. Click the last point and the road is built. It's very simple.However, this game has some problems of it's own. Let's start off with the biggest problem: stability. The game runs on Unity. And while Unity is pretty good at making decent games, it does suffer from a minor stability issue, where the game crashes due to a GetThreadContextException. If you save a lot, the game will remain manageable, and the progress loss will be minor, but it is a nuisance that is common in Unity games.The UI may require a little direction, but is manageable once you've completed the tutorial. The tutorial does miss a few mechanics, though. For instance, you'll need to go to Reddit or the wiki to find out how to work with water buses and trolleys, although the latter is similar to the trams in many ways.Then there's some missing features which'll leave most players going WTF MATES?! One thing I miss is the ability to change roads without having to demolish them.Next, there's difficulty. While metros are a massive investment, if you get major corners of a city connected, you'll earn it all back in a single afternoon. In the days that follow, you spend most of your time getting rid of the passenger back-ups that are caused by the vast new amount of transport opportunities. And while you'd expect 50% coverage is an easy feat, it's surprisingly difficult. But with no competition and the lack of a loss condition, there is limited challenge.The last complaint I have is the fact that at the moment (2014-03-23) I think some of the DLC has a fairly poor content/value balance. Furthermore, there's multiple packages that are very focused on owners of the older Cities In Motion. Despite that, some DLC does offer some nice changes. For instance, the Metro DLC completely overhauls the mechanics of the Metros, making the whole system a lot deeper. Fortunately, there is no vital DLC. The game is perfectly playable without any DLC. I do believe that the DLC offers a lot of options that are better than the standard options though.Despite that, it has some nice things. For one, the world looks very good. I find it very relaxing to for instance just position my camera over a suburban surface railway station and just watch the trains come and go. Also, the passenger simulation has a great, but manageable level of detail. It quickly becomes noticeable if that multi-million dollar metro line was really worth covering the entire city for, but passengers use it and existing lines that barely made the cut have now become viable, so it probably is. You can get a lot of information about the state of your city and your company by looking at the data views, and some of that information can tell you very useful stuff, like if it's a good idea to use the highway, or to build a dedicated route, as well as if a line is likely to provide your system with a good amount of traffic.On the whole, I think this is a good game. It has it's flaws, yes, like relatively high DLC prices, roads being impossible to upgrade without having to tear them down, and some other minor nuisances. But it's good looking, plays fairly well, and if you're a perfectionist and immense fan of making a perfect transport system, this'll keep you busy for hours."

The map is also very deceptive as to how long it takes to get between places, what looks like a short bus route can easily be a 5 hour journey.That said, I've not yet spent hours and hours playing this, so my opinion of it may well change as I get better at the game.

The road creation is nice, really advanced. But they miss completly the relation between time and vehicule speed. 11km can take 8 hour for tram, without traffic. What's the point? I is faster to walk. This can be ok because it's a simulation. But they included timetable. How to you want to manage ""real time""  with vehicule take a whole day to do a circuit. They is a limit to say ""it's a simulation"".

Unfortunately, this game just seems too different from the first.My very first mistake was my incompetence of reading more negative reviews. Because little did I know, all of the cities in this game are fictional. One thing I loved about Cities in Motion was that you could play in cities like Berlin, Tokyo, Frankfurt, etc. I don't like playing in fictional cities, and while you can indeed simply create your own city in the editor (or get a map off of the workshop,) that's not for me. I much prefer official things. They did release a European Cities DLC that adds Prague, Liverpool, and one German city; but I really don't want to pay more money for this. I feel that historical cities should have just been added from the start, but instead, I forsee that we'll have to either buy what should have came with the game from the start, or rely on player created historical cities (which are pretty good, actually.)Secondly, I (Remember: My opinion) dislike the drastic change with scheduling, depots, etc. I liked how simple it was in the first game. You build some bus stops, buy a bus, set up a line, and watch progress be made. Now you must work with a time schedule--which many may agree is an awesome update, but I much prefer keeping it like the first game. I at least wish there was an option to play the original way--perhaps a ""classic"" mode. If they implemented this, I would definitely switch this over to a positive and buy this for my friends.Again, that's just why I don't recommend this game. Many--if not most--will actually find this game much more improved over the first. I jumped into this game expecting the exact same thing as the first game, but alas, there's a whole new learning curve to adjust to. So to sum it up: This game is a more realistic version of the first game.I'm going to continue playing this game, as I believe I've gotten the ropes down. But boy, I sure wish the first game was multiplayer co-op."

Not sure if this is the best way, but they seems to work.-Use buses the first few times. It's much easier to fix your mistakes.-Build large bus routes. They seems to work better than lots of small ones.-Try to have them connect to the seperate parts of the city. Crossing a bridge from a smaller part to one of the center islands increases ticket sales.-Use the Economic Panel. You can change ticket prices, employee salaries, take loans(dont recommend this), and see your weekly cash flow.-Don't increase ticket prices to much in the beginning. You will lose popularity.-Look at you individual lines. If you click on them they will tell you how many vehicles are required, your weekly income and expenses, and passenger reports. Check this to see if a route is making or losing money. I ended up removing 3 smaller lines when I first learned this because they were costing me nearly 3000 a week.-Connect your lines. Have two seperate lines use the same stop. It will allow you to transport them further without having to build a new line.-Be patient. It takes time for your lines to make money. It might be a good idea to just leave this on while you do something else for a while. Be sure to save whenever you come back to check on it, though, sometimes you will start to lose money for no apparent reason."

It's not difficult to win once you get a feel for what the different transport types can support and how to space them out to give good service(hint: try following a grid, <5 minutes round trip for any one line). It can be very relaxing, even when you're doing poorly, and there are plenty of options for setting up a complex network even without the DLC additions.I have two issues with the game:The first is that track and stop placement can be tedious and error-prone, depending on which type of transit you're working with. Although the majority of the time, you want your tram and trolley lines(which are built at street level) to either continue straight ahead or take a 90-degree bend, you have to carefully click each road segment and scroll each time, which, combined with the low visibility of these constructions, almost guarantees that you mess up and fail to link one of the segments and then have to go back and debug it when the game tells you the route can't reach a stop. There is no tool to simplify this construction phase, even though the game can adequately plan the entire route for you when you use buses on existing roads - so you may spend a LOT of time squinting and clicking. Similarly, when building underground roads or metro lines, there is no way to view through the roads, which means that when you go to add stops, you have to either work extremely hard to position the camera to see through a road, build around the road, or tear up the road and add it again.A lazy player is going to want to build only buses, watertaxis and underground metros that consciously avoid overlapping the road.The second problem is with the city growth model. To induce growth, all a player has to do is build new roads with sidewalks, and improve overall transit service. The player doesn't get any control over what types of zones appear, even though they're relevant to decisions about transit scheduling and peak service. This makes city growth feel very ""one size fits all"" - the growth is generic so you have to build generically - and since you can add roads anywhere that the terrain will fit, the simplest growth strategy is rinse-and-repeat: build a new metro line, and build roads on top of it. When I discovered this it  detracted from any sense of individual character amongst cities. Growth can be turned off, at the expense of making the game feel more like a static ""fill in the blanks"" exercise."

The way you build tracks and roads sucks, building underground metro tunnels is the worst. The screen gets filled up with lots of windows everytime you click anything. Route planing is almost as bad as building tracks and gives you no real control, just click some stops and see what happens. There realy should be a way to make ""loop-routes"" without the bus or whatever unload all passengers and going into the depot at the end of each trip.Anyway.. I just don't like the gameplay or the interface in the game. What's worse is how buggy the Linux version is. First couple of times I tried to start the game from steam it did just quit at once after it was launched. Had to do som tinkering about and starting the game outside from steam, etc, etc before I could even play the game. It seems to me like most linuxusers doesn't get the water to be rendered. I also discovered that when ""painting"" ticket zones, all zones (blue, green, red) shows up as yellow in the main window. So you have to look at the minimap and just hope that you can hit the right spot..Conclussion: There's probably a reason why ther is no demo for this game, nobody would pay money for this after trying it. If you want a transportation game, download OpenTTD instead, it's free and I can't think of any aspect of Cities in Motion that is better than OpenTTD.

And, ultimately while I think it's good, it's not quite ever going to be a classic of the genra that Railroad Tycoon II is.In many ways the compairison is a fair one. Both games focus on transportation logistics. In the scenarios I describe, both games focus on moving passengers through an urban envrioment. That's where they start to differ. Cities in Motion 2 is zoomed in quite a bit. You have to plan your trackwork, or overhead wires block by block. You have a dozen different modes of transportation to work with, not just a station and a station radius. You plan individual trips for your vehicles on the route and you have to worry about rush hour and adding extra capacity for peak times in Cities in Motion. Where the defining unit of time is a year in Railroad Tycoon, it is a day in Cities in Motion.The sad thing is this detail is incomplete in many ways. You can't get your subways or trams to revers direction in place, for example. You can't forbid left or right turns when modifying the road work. And, unless you spring for the DLC, you only get 3 choices for each type of vehicle.The day-night cycle and rush-hour are interesting logistically, but it causes the financial model to feel weird. You might spend hours of wall time waiting for your operation to turn enough of a profit so you can expand. And the random objectives often seem to ask you to do something non-sensical, or don't even work right at all. lI'm somewhat willing to forgive these gameplay issues because I love the genra and the core gameplay does something that's very ambicious very well. It simualtes (or does a good job pretending to simulate) the movements of thousands citizens's daily lives. While traffic routing (particularly without the road building tools I described) can do some dumb thing from time to time, it mostly works very well and your public transit system fits right in with it. I like this game, and if this review sounds at all negative, it's beause it's tough being compared to what I reguard as the greatest game of all time."

The cities in Cities in Motion 1 are a lot better, the user interface is a lot easier to use, and it is also easier to build lines in Cities in Motion 1. Cities in Motion 2 has some improvements like more (realistic looking) vehicles like the almost exact copy of the Berlin U-Bahn H01 and also has some improvements in building subway lines. The fact that there is a schedule is also a big improvement. But it is a lot easier to build lines in CiM 1 than in CiM 2 because it seems like there is always a problem for example when I tried to place a metro track undergruond and there was nothing around it it said that there was no room. All together, I would reccomend anyone thinking about buying this game to get CiM 1."

As a huge fan of the original Cities in Motion (600+ hours played), the gameplay on CIM2 is absolutely awful, it is so annoying moving around the map using the keyboard, the cities are boring - just clusters of development with nothing in between, plus they are named 'Central City', 'East City' (where is the imagination??). There are some good new features - timetabling, depots, building roads etc. - but they spent so much time on those that they forgot about the core of the game. The game feels very arcade like. VERY disappointed."

The game has beautiful graphics, an amazingly smart iinterface allowing to implement almost any idea on the map. In fact CiM2 is just one step from a full scale city builder.Although the campaign can be considered a weak spot (it's incomparable to the scenarios from CIM1), the game's strongest point is the community, filling the workshop with great maps from all over the world. All this will keep you playing CIM2 for hundreds of hours."

,Recommended,225420,21499234,"Posted: 27 February, 2016",all,George Costanza,"Like all niche games, CiM2 is hard to review because your enjoyment of the game will largely depend on if you like the premise. If the idea of laying down metro lines, bus lines and optimising a public transport system is fun to you - you'll probably like this game. If you complain that there's no option for single-track or quadruple-track metros in Cities: Skylines this game is also for you. On the whole, the game acheives this goal fine - if you want to build a public transport system, you'll enjoy CiM2.There are some problems, however. The worst (and most baffiling) is the poor way that fares are managed. You have to set each fare for each transit type manually (i.e. bus, single-trip, multi-zone). There's at least twenty options to manually set, and no option for AI control - when the game decides that your city is going through a recession, you can esaily spend 5 (dull) minutes pressing sliders to set fares. You generally aim to keep the fares at the (game-determined) optimum, I don't see any reason why the AI can't do this. Likewise, there's no option to 'upgrade' or 'replace' a road, like in Cities: Skylines. Upgrading a corridor to include bus lanes is unrealistically expensive. The game's tutorial is also poor, much of it is intuitive if you've played a city builder previously. For everything else, you'll need online tutorials.Without the DLC, the cities are all imaginary, although there's plenty of real cities avalable in the workshop now. The lack of an airport building is also a notable omission. Likewise, the addition of bus rapid transit systems and light rail (as opposed to trams) would have been nice - although it's possible to fudge a system in-game.This is overall an enjoyable game if you want a city building game that's only about public transport. If this doesn't sound appealing to you, CiM2 is probably not for you."

It would be nice to have options like better buses, trams.  You cannot even download this stuff for a cost and there have been very few updates that are worth while in buying over the last bit.  A shame as it is a good game, and to be honest, I like the sandbox mode where you can build your own city, if they have a drive in your own city like Sim City 4  Rushhour did would make it a good city building game (well besides the fact that many of the buildings look the same).  Either way a great city building game (yes I know it is a transportation game, that part needs work, simple work if you ask me, just give us a DLC option to invest in bus/tram options like better buses/trams etc...)7.5/10"
,Recommended,225420,21187264,"Posted: 13 February, 2016",all,Cmdo.Delta,"This is a great game. Its biggest weakness is the lack of a good tutorial. When you're done with tutorial, you know about 5% of the game. Really... You are not learning anything useful. Especially if you are a player of Cities in Motion 1, you aren't learning something new with the tutorial. And that's why this game is so hard to play. The game is a big step higher in term of management and they are not teaching anything about this. So most people will give up before starting to enjoy it because they dont want to dig forever to find out how it works. And I guess this is the reason the reviews are so bad. I'll make mine a positive review even if I'm part of those disapointed people that don't understand half how the game works. Because I know it's a good game and a great step higher than Cities in motion 1. But still, I dont understand exactly how every features work and it's not making me wanna play more. This is sad. This game could have been a real blast to play if there was the appropriate tutorial to teach people how it works. That's something the dev could have upgraded. They could have get way better reviews and get more people interested into playing this game (especially now they released Cities Skyline which is a very popular and appreciated game). Come on Colossal order, give Cities in Motion 2 the tutorial it deserves!"
