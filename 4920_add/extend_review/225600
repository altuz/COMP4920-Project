I personally never saw a game like this, but the setting is still awesome.You have your 4 characters;3.5 Characters, because pure is still unfinishedPhalanx, Judgement, Ryoku and Pure. All of them have their own move set, animations and taunts even, who are all optimizable. (Im not going to discuss who is under-and overpowered, so shush)You can equip those characters with 5 different swordtypes; Longsword, Scimitar, Rapier, Katana and Jian, which are all unlocked in the start of the game and the only thing you can unlock is eye-candy, which doesnt affect gameplay at all. Meaning, no matter how long you play the game, you wont unlock anything that will affect gameplay.Coupled with some parkour (which is useless) and a nice fighting system (which I wont explain either) and you have a perfect game, right?...No..not really.The Good-Nice Fighting System-Responsive Controls-Good designed free for all and Duel game modes, where FFA can be moddable, being a source game.-A lot of workshop integration which fits this game perfectly-Online leaderboards which keeps track of your progressAnd now....the dark side of this gameThe Bad-Bad Tracers (Hit detection if you want it that way)-Hitboxes can be just awful at times-Lag can do a lot of weird stuff-4. Character Pure is unfinished-Characters have attacks which are just broken or weird-A lot of balancing problems-Random and unexplainable FPS drops sometimes-The General Duel maps have FPS problems in general-Ranking system is just not executed well-Buggy Physics and just stuff thats not supposed to happen-The Game Is DeadThis is where the normal review ends. Ill give this game a 5.5/10. Dont pick this up for the normal price, get it on a sale, when you really want it. Yes, I have a decent amount of playtime still racking up. But at this point I cant recommend this game.You can end here or keep reading for some more details, details, yay!EDIT: No, I dont hate this game. The community is great (aside from a few people), the concept is awesome and the game is overall fun. I just cant recommend it at this state. YES, I like this game.Dead SymphonySimply, this game is dead. Trying to get in new in this game is hard, because the most active players are the advanced and good ones. The community doesnt grow, the devs (and the balancing team) keep doing decisions and decision which are just not explainable. Most old-school players quit and/or switched to other games;For a reason, you will notice when you go online everyday for a week: You keep meeting the same people over and over again. And the new players will just get crushed by the advanced ones (This game is multiplayer only), having no chance to get better without avoiding the good players all the time.The game isnt even THAT bad, its just how I said. Fighting the same people over and over again just gets boring.BUT, the community IS good. Some people of the balancing team are nice players and some devs even play the game!The game being dead, means we meet the same people over and over again (For the third time now), but that also means that were a BETTER community. We know eachother better when theres less people.Well, yeah, sucks that the community keeps getting smaller because more and more people are quitting.If the devs dont do something, this game is poorly advertised aswell, the game is going to be dead soon. Dead for good.God, that was a lot of random bu!!sh!t. But you wanted a review and here it is.Thanks for reading! <3"
,Recommended,225600,7982847,"Posted: 9 December, 2013",all,Eaguru,"I absolutely love this game. I am enamoured by it, addicted to it, and appalled by it. I'm conflicted, because it is incredibly fun and incredibly flawed. It's fast-paced 1-on-1 sword fighting action that's neither realistic nor fantastical.Before I say anything else, I will preface with this: you are buying into Early Access. This review is written pre-1.0 release. The game is inherently unfinished and has issues. I'm certain these will be addressed sooner or later.Blade Symphony is a 3D directional fighter, taking cues from Soul Calibur, Jedi Knight Academy and GunZ. I've been told it's ""like GunZ, without the guns."" The (currently) four fighters have their own movesets and synergies with weapon types. It's up to the player to figure out the various stance chains (between Fast, Balanced, and Heavy), how to space them, and how to time them. Players will link these moves together, stabbing, slashing and bashing each other until one fighter loses. That's as simple as it gets.If you're looking for a description of basic game mechanics, there are other reviews for that.What I'm primarily writing about is where the game simultaneously fails and succeeds: its unintentional systems. These buried systems that new players will not be introduced to, and be simultaneously destroyed by, are my favourite and least favourite part of Blade Symphony. These tricks are similar to how K-Styling came to be in GunZ—happy accidents that came about as a flaw in the mechanics. Air canceling, animation canceling and gliding are some of the tricks and mechanic abuses that have become what is the current meta of ""advanced play"" in Blade Symphony. While many lower ranked players will play it straight, advanced players will frequently dominate arenas against players that do not know how to leverage these unintentional mechanics. Many newcomers will not have the patience to learn how to play against or adopt these strategies and will be put off. At the same time, it adds options and extra layers to a game that would otherwise be fairly simple.This is where I'm conflicted. I love the community teaching aspect. I feel accomplished knowing how to beat cheese strategies, how to beat spam, and how to execute these exploits. At the same time, is it a good thing that a game relies on the crutches of unintentional design to succeed? Maybe. Maybe not.I'm in love with the game. You might hate it. I support this game to the fullest, but be wary of what you're getting into. Blade Symphony is one of the best $15 I've spent in a while. It might be your worst.All I know is that my adrenaline is pumping and I am having one hell of a time."

But first some things I wish to point out.After 900 hours I can be a little biased in favor of this gameThis is not a game where a person with 1 hour should be reviewing, this game takes much more time to understand and any reviews from these people should be ignored, if you like it or not.Blade Symphony, released May 7, 2014 by Puny Human Games. This is a game that without a doubt I am addicted too, though idk if that is good or bad, probably bad. From my first day on Blade Symphony spamming with Jian Ryoku, to becoming almost top tier, my journey has been wonderful. I have met tons of people, most of them on my steam friends list and I dont regret anything. Though I feel like im a rare case, for many many players have stopped playing for multiple reasons that ill get too in second.Pros:Complex fighting mechanics (can be good or bad, but probably a good thing).Good community, most of them you will talk to and get to know them a little bit.Members of the community are taking an initiative to try and balance the game.Awesome soundtrack.Fun player-made events like Battlechess, Machine, King of the Hill, Fencing, Kendo etc.Steam Workshop enabled, allowing you to choose from tons of player made swords.Cons:Bad retention rate.Not much content.Time between patches can get rather long.Devs aren't as involved as they once were (though they are still here).This is one of those games that is not for everyone, and if you get this game you need to go in knowing that you will get stomped, beaten, and ""lolgitgudfgtggnore""'ed by bad eggs, this is only a very small amount of players though, most of the players are actually very friendly and willing to help you. Time and practice will gain you skill, you will need to be patient. You dont know how many times ive seen new players come in and get mad because they cant win. Sorry, your not going to win against someone with houndreds of hours. As of right now their are two servers with teachers, ""Sexy Food"" US, and ""Avalaon"" EU.But this game isnt without flaws, because of the games retention rate (sorry cant remeber the exact figure), you will notice not very many play this game. Those that do play, have lots of hours. So if you are looking for a game with many players. Quit reading and find a new game. But because this is a fighting game, the most important thing is the balancing. Tbh this game has become less balanced than in the past. But im sure devs, and experienced players will work together to balance the game in time.If you are looking for a complex fighting game, and can handle being beaten up many times, I strongly recommend this game. As I said, this game isnt for everyone and you need patience. But after 900+ hours ive had my journey and it has been pleasant, and I wish to see more people.I mentioned about me having most of my friends list ppl from Blade Symphony.

Kickstarter promises were not kept, game was released in an unfinished state to get more financing to keep the project going, so you're basically buying a released game that's still early access. Critisism gets censored from forums and even screenshots are subject to deletion. Patches break more than they fix and it takes ages for them to come out.

Sword fights feel solid and responsive (with a good framerate and better than 100 ping of course). Great futuristic-y design, sweet music, and really cool people. A lot of people compare the combat to Dark Souls and Soul Calibur but I really don't see the resemblance. It also sounds like it's inspired a fair bit by the Jedi Knight games, but i've never played those. You can live all your dreams of pointed and sharp weapons, from poking someone in the eye to cutting their shin. One of the best parts is that not all weapons are pointed and sharp, thanks to Steam Workshop integration. Overall great game, would recommended to anyone who's a fan of sword fights. i give it a good/10 much sword so indie (im sorry). also all the unlocks are cosmetic ok"

This is part review, part history.tl:dr   This isn't what it used to be. The playerpase is small, but its very tight knit. It's the kind of community where everyone know's everyone by name. The gameplay itself is wonky but often fun when you get it right. The learning curve is a brick wall. You're going to lose a lot when you start. Don't be afraid to ask for help. Almost everyone in master rank would be more than pleased to take you udner their wing, all you have to do is ask.Don't expect this to be a hardcore fighter with lots of fierce competition. Thats what Blade Symphony used to be. Today theres an average of 10 different people who log on per day. I can say for sure that I'm one of those 10. This game is what most would be concidered dead. To the newcomer this game will seem like theres nothing here for you. I'm here to tell you you're wrong. You're simply unable to see it for what it is.Where this game excells is in the high level community. The issue is the skill gap between those dubbed ""newgen"" and those from the old gen and alpha gen. The majority of regular players have played for years. I have played for 2 years, and over a year of that was solely training the class I use. Many people who have played less have attained my skill level and beyond, but it still takes a conciderable amount of time. On top of that this game is impossible to play without a lot of resiliance. Put short, you will lose. You will lose often if not constantly. However thats how you learn. If you can take a loss without suffering the weight of defeat then you'll make it far in this game. The people who sit atop the skill ladder are there not because they have inate tallent, but because they simply kept trying. And you too can join them, all you have to do is not quit. Keep at it. Learn from your mistakes. Reach out to masters for help. Reach out to me for help. I'll tech you how to play if you really want to become better (disclaimer: I'm a bad teacher).My final reason Blade is good is the community. Some parts of it are toxic, some are sweet. Overall it's tight knit and diverse. If you play more than a week you'll recognise everyody. 3 weeks and you'll know everybody. In no other game have I seen this many freindships form and hold over time. I have my mixed feeling with the people I play this game with but the one thing I can say about the people of Blade Symphony is that thay're the only people here I really trust. We're not here to beat you back to cs:go. We're here to be your freind and have some fun. Thats what this game is about. Its about having a good duel and not climbing the ladder.If you're hesitant about this game pm me, and I can talk to you about it and why you should play."

Put simply this game takes a lot of skill and quite some time to learn, but once you do it can keep you sitting still for hours. You have 5 swords and 5 characters, you pick a sword and a character and then start playing. All of those do different things and YOU as a player might benefit from different elements, so try a bit of everything to find out what's best for you, then play that for a long time and develope your own personal playstyle.Graphics are avarage, if not slightly below avarage. Some character faces are really weard. 5/10Sound effects are not beautiful to listen to, but they are obvious and instantly tells you what's happening even if you aren't paying attention or seeing what's happening. 5/10Music is just good and matches the character and map design. It brings you a feeling that is signature to this game. 7/10Combat system is very good and might be what makes fights in Blade Symphony so entertaining. Blade Symphony has this rock paper scissor system, which means some attacks beats others when they meet, also charging and things that are unique to some swords are also very fun and makes you think a bit more of what you pick. 10/10Although this game is not always so impressive at first sight, it keeps you entertained in the length, and you always keep learning and getting better even when your playtime hits the roof. This is my favorite game of all time due to not only the time spent but the moments I were given and friends I met, along with difficult fights and teaching newer players in game a thing or two.LASER OUT ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)!"

The achievement doesn't even work.All of this is a damn shame because this is one of the most interesting and beautiful games in terms of mechanics and aesthetics, form and function, that I have seen in a long time. It is innovative and competitive and calls on reflex, skill, and intelligence. Unfortunately, it has gone unrecognized and unsupported. Maybe the controls are too weird or it took too many steps outside the comfort zone of the average gamer.I will say that it doesn't feel natural to control this game with a mouse and keyboard; pressing buttons isn't enough. Maybe with better technology and tactile control, this game would work better. I hope that a game like this appears when we have the hardware interface to support it."

The game is really well built, its a solid game what can I say, sure the animations could use more work but it is very structurally sound, meaning it's perfect for a fighting game.Its pretty damn balanced, meaning people will always find different things to ♥♥♥♥♥ about rather than uniteing over something being over-powered. Yeah people will agree that vanguard and longsword is overpowered, but after that it seems like free reign.So what's  my point? Well my point is, if you don't like a hardcore competitive nature in a game, then this is not for you. Hell at first I didn't like blade symphony untill I invested 10 hours into it, then it became like crack cocaine. It is not a game where you can cheese your way to victory over the best players, you have to actually improve at the game meaning that something that works again lesser skilled players doesn't work against the best.The game has a pretty weird learning curve, I feel like at first it is not steep at all because your like ""O boy this oak doesn't know what's comeing with my N1 heavy left and right phalanx play"" but after that it is very steep once you realise that playstyle isn't a very viable way to play the game. So listen here buddy boy it gets harder, but I know you can pull through it, just like you pulled through reading this much bull-crap that doesn't matter. After you get over that and you realise that judge is the best charecter obviously and every other one is for ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, then you start haveing some real fun and you can dish out your e-peen among skeleton and zeo and watch them strip you bare and cold in the russian winter.So what is my actual point, well, it's a game for people who want to be competitive in a pretty balanced game. You have to roll with the punches baby boy.The reason I'm not reviewing the game so much as reviewing you is because this is simply one of the best games I have ever have the pleasure of playing, it is a gem covered in dirt in the middle of a secret ravine full of bipolar neckbeards. There are flaws but they are only apparent when you just start playing, as you play more and more you start to see it as this holy image of a perfect game.The reason I see it like this is because it is just so damn solid overall, you have different ways of playing different charecters and you can try and make your way work. It is rage enduseing but in the good kind of way I guess. There are different sword types, attack paterns, since it's 3D you have different ways people manuver creating very interesting gameplay.So to conclude this great speech of nothingness I guess it's up to you if you want to buy this game or not, hell I don't know if you will like it. You can take my word but I'm probably wrong maybe, if you tried this game and didn't like it, come back and give it a second chance please, it truly is a game that the community makes, and even with a small community it still is fun. Buy the game if you havn't right now its 9$, 200 hours is worth that money any day.tl;dr: Me and zeo are actually secret lovers in a alternate reality"

Stance changing should be done away with and replaced with dedicated light/med/heavy buttons.Advertised breadth of fighting styles is exaggerated as only a few are viable, with the majority of them involving mashing M1 with a good deal of jumping around since the dodge mechanics are unreliable.Hit detection is often suspect, as you will find yourself tapping your opponent with your sword and not being granted a hit as their sword registers before coming close to you. Air juggling opponents as you attack below their feet is common. You will be left wondering how your opponent hits you or you them, which leads to another point--The system itself has many bugs that the veteran players pass off as actual systems, then abuse. Things like preforming an air attack right as you land will send certain classes gliding across the ground, and  grab attacks that skip animation frames thus not allowing a counter.A good way to judge the competitiveness of a game is how consistent it is, and this is BS's biggest let down. You will see high ranked players loosing to new players often enough to realize that strategy doesn't mean as much as you would hope, unless the tactic happens to be spam m1 between light and medium stances while hopping around with a quick class, or charging attacks and jumping toward your opponent to fire them off as the heavy class.Unlockables are cosmetic. A good choice for a game that presents itself as competitive.Art style is whatever. A mix of Asian and future punk.Game is still in development, so community is extremely small.Being in development, all the negatives of this review might eventually be ironed out. However, with the dev time coming up on 2+ years, I don't hold out much hope. I can see its release being met with little recognition and quickly fading back into the Lobby-With-Side-Minigame that it is now.In short, it tries to put forth a competitive ideal but the result ends up feeling shallow and often times random or unfair. If you are a fan of competitive fighting games (or even action games like Ninja Gaiden or DMC), you will quickly get annoyed with how loose the game feels and its inconsistencies. If you want to swing weightless, occasionally incorporeal swords at other people while hopping around, this might be a game for you."

The game doesn't really ""help"" u to get in the game. Tutorial gives u the basics and the Training sessions with bots are boring and easy. But as soon as u enter a server u will love it. U'll search for competetors and duel one after another. You will improve by every mistake and it won't get boring that fast, because everyone got his own fighting style... some go more agressive some stay more defensively ; sure u will say right now "" then there are noobs who take forfeits in sitting in one corner"" , and i can easily say that this is not true. Why u may ask? The game gives u everything u need to take or make forfeits. U can win every (EVERY) fight. I play with my brothers and friends and we compete with each other and others on the internet. The game is worth it's cost so go ahead and buy it."

In practice there are a few strategies that are very effective and most people just use those over and over. Combat in the game feels hindered by the game's complexity more than it is aided by it.Not very many maps and the only thing really worth doing in the game is dueling.

The unique Fightingsystem in combination with the strong artstyle and the solid music performance entertained me for some hours but I never managed to master the combat.The Fights can depending on the players be a slow and thoughtfull dance or more of a furryfilled rampage, and both ways can be quite funn.There are several fightmodes, like 1vs1 2vs2 1vs2 and even capture the point like teamgames.Camera and controlls work fine, despite being a little bit clunky sometimes.There are many things to unlock but all are purley cosmetic. So it allways is a skill question who winns, and not simply the equipment that winns a fight.Loading Screens took way too long for me though and the game crashed from time to time when I wanted to switch server.The Interfaces look nice but could be a lot more clear than they are now.So in summary it is a great experience with some weakpoints that can be annoing but do not kill the whole game.But there is one more thing that changes nearly everything:The game has AI controlled opponents, but they can't (as far as I figured it out) fill in in real player matches. They are restricted to the practice mode. This means that without Friends to play wou might not find a single server to play on with players on it. And if you find one they often are way above your experience level and can stump you into the ground without much effort... Or you find friends playing that do not always want to play with random strangers. It seems there is still a bunch of active players, and with some efford you can surley organize a full server on a sunnday evening or so.But if you just wanna start the game and play, it will feel like a ghosttown.Final Words:Would love to recommend it but I just can't do that in this state, with the exeption for someone who has some frineds to play this with. Not a perfect game by far (For honor could be a good alternative nowadays) but it is certainly not a teriible game aswell. If yo uare still interested just grab it at a sale and give it a try.Thanks for reading."

Nowadays, there are only 5 or less people on a single server, and it would sometimes be rare to find a server with more than that amount.But sometimes, I wonder, what went wrong with this game?The game has an amazing concept, that's for sure. The idea of dueling using a variety of combo's is certaintly intresting, with the community having to study each move a character makes carefully, to figure out what is the best one. It also looks a bit nice, as you watch your fighter gracefully execute their moves in a strong fashion.But what I think went wrong with this game is that it simply unfinished.Right now, there are only 5 characters to choose from, each with their own style with a variety of weapons to pick. But the issue here is, there isn't really much to do other than duel other people. Sure fighting other people is fun, but what else is there? Yeah there are other modes, but what else? The main thing here iswhat else?There are only about 3 modes to choose from, while the developers rarely provide updates for the game. This is more of a game to play once in a while, maybe with your friends or with other people, and that's that.However,I do think this is an alright game, despite its flaws. But I simply cannot reccommend this game, with its community abandoning the game, the lack of modes, and the dev's not really supporting this game at a fast rate.Unless you've got some friends to play with, I suggest to buy this game when it's heavily discounted.Edit, Nov 23 2016: I've checked out the store page of this game to see if anything has changed and to my surprise, this game is now around $5 CAN when it was originally around $15 CAN at the time of this review. Although I still stand by my criticism, I can suggest that due to its price, you wouldn't have to wait for a giant discount on this game.But, like I've said previously, only a few people play this game nowadays; it's best to pick it up when you have a bunch of friends joining the fun along side you."

Why the game is bad results in the characters, the duels, and the ranks/ladder. The characters are bland, and can be even claimed as ""generic"". All of them have the ability spam their fast combo, which is what 75% of the community does anyway.All the characters have different play styles, which might sound good but they're all just awfully cheap. Pure is all about strafing their attacks in a sideways direction to hit. Ryouko is spin/spam to win. Phalnax is pure fast combo poking spam with a little bit of timing. Judge is timing, and heavy damage spamming with the balanced combo. Each is used in a cheap way, which makes the experience of the game unrealistic and frustrating.The Duels are not smooth at all, considering the cheesy animations and the constant spam. To win, its basically who can spam faster. All duesl are the same, as no one uses wall jumping or parkour in general for an advantage, and you're even looked down on by the annoying community.The ranks and ladder system is sad after this new update. I have gotten to a master rank after 24 hours of gameplay. Tells you how easy it is to get to the top, and when you get there it would probably lead to boredom. You dont gain a sense of achievement, as many other players just aren't good, and they somehow gain high ranks (possibly through spamming)To end off, all talk about the community. Generally, most people will cry when a fight is won, or the claim ""gg"" which is completely fine. Its a 50 - 50 ratio between the two, which is not too bad. The worst part of the community is their maturity. I generally go on and theres plenty of mic spammers, and people who cry about it and don't realize theres a mute button, which might be the only useful thing on the interface. Another person you will find, is, ""The Master"". These people roleplay as a super good samurai otaku weeaboo, or they'll act rude and type during a match things like ""kek did you think that would work"" and then spam you to death with a pure strafing move.

It's not the type of (sword) fighting game that I had expected or hoped for.  The game does not force players to face each other and fight like traditional fighting games do. Instead it gives you free range of movement around the environment like a FPS game. And because it controls like a FPS and not a fighting game I have to spend more time trying to keep my opponent in my feild of view than I do actually fighting him. It makes me dizzy and frustrated. I am a fan of fighting games, and third-person perspective action games, but I think this game would only really appeal to fans of competitive FPS games.  I really wish there was a demo of this game available, or at least a more in-depth description of how it's played. I was looking forward to this game, and I really wanted to like it, but it's not a game that will appeal to fans of traditional 2D or 3D fighting games, and ultimately I feel disappointed.I'm sure this game will appeal to many people, unfortunately I am not one of them.What else can I say about this game....The graphics and animations are fairly good, but the ability to customize and individualize your character are very limited. You can use an xbox 360 gamepad to play the game, but you'll be at a disadvantage to the keyboard/mouse players.EDIT - In conclusion:call it what you want, but it's NOT a fighting game.  It's a bunch of people running around in circles hoping to slash an opponent as they go by. The actual gameplay looks very little like the videos on the store page, and it does not resemble a real fight in any way. Its not tactical sword fighting, it's a frenzied arcade hack-n-slash with frustratingly wild camera movements to go along with odd hit-detection and unintuitive controls. The four playable characters are as lame as they are limited, and the different skins available do not do much to help individualize your character.

Combat has moments of slow and fast-paced action, with the focus of the game being around 1v1 and 2v2 dueling, as well as a FFA mode which is good for beginners. Each weapon and each character has its own style of fighting and combat is very direction-based.  It requires strategy, thought and observation if you want to be great at it. The game's graphics are very nice and animation quality is top-notch. You can do a lot of very cool moves, from wall-running and jumping to combos and power attacks.

However, now that this game has been fully released with an Original Soundtrack, and after playing it for a while, I regret I didn't spend that money on Blade Symphony. Some, probably most, will find it unfair since this is the full release of Blade Symphony and DayZ is still in Early Access. But the truth is, you can barely compare the two games because they share very few things in common anyway.Blade Symphony is a third-person PVP melee combat game, with skill-orientated swordfighting. It takes place in a universe called Berimbau, its history stretches back “thousands of years, to a handful of warring clans that ultimately came to peace terms and unified under a single flag: The Black Rose."" There’s more story, which is why I’m hoping for a possible campaign down the road. If you want to know more story look it up or buy the game with the OST.The player has four stances during combat: Fast, Balanced, Heavy, and Air (when one jumps). Each stance has different types of attacks/sword strokes, and one can use even more using the movement keys while attacking at the same time, like slashing to the sides. There is also a Rock-Paper-Scissors system for parrying (parrying occurs when blades collide as they’re both being swung at the same time), Heavy stance is beat in parry by the Air stance, Balanced stance is beat in parry by Heavy stance, Fast stance is beat in parry by Balanced stance, and Air stance is beat in parry by Fast stance. If both stances are the same, they both cancel out. You can switch stances mid-combo and produce a unique combination of attacks as well. The character can run, strafe, dash (includes power-dash), roll, and wall-walking/wall flips (parkour). With all this combined, the game requires skill and tactical thought. It is not an easy game to play, and there are very good players out there. You need to pay attention and you need to be quick, timing is everything. The four classes at your disposal all have unique traits and moves, choose wisely: Phalanx, the one who lunges and thrusts, fencing style. He can close in quickly and has great reach. Judgement, the one who has thick metal armour and prefers big swings. He is slow, but can take hits that would normally greatly damage other classes and he hits harder than a bulldoser. Ryoku, the one who uses rhythm and breakdancing to fight in a unique way. He moves around erratically confusing his opponents, and hits fast and quickly (pretty strong hits too). And last but surely not least, Pure, the one who is heavily influenced by Chinese Wushu, an acrobatic exhibition and full-contact sport derived from traditional martial arts. She can make use of her acrobatics to move past an enemy’s defense and strike fluidly.Now let’s talk graphics. This game isextremelybeautiful. The sword models were the first thing that caught my eye after launching the game, with awesome shots of swords and swordsmen up close and wide all over the home screen. I am satisfied with the texture’s resolutions on everything in the game. The character models are also very well modeled. The maps are rendered wonderfully, some being fairly big and mildly-explorable in their own right. The particle effects while fighting are bright, but subtle, and they fade away as fast as they appear which makes the fights look nicer and better overall. The developers did a good job optimizing the game as well, I can max out the graphical settings on my humble gaming laptop and it runs perfectly. Oh btw, spectating on a duel is a sight to behold.Then there is the game’s Original Soundtrack, which is, in my opinion, one of the better video game soundtracks I’ve heard. It has a traditional Japanese/Chinese mood to it, but there is hints of western influence in there, as well as more modern sounds like EDM. The OST comes with a text file that expresses the fact that the game’s story is not told through the gameplay, “Who are these sword-wielding badasses and why are they killing each other through Asian temples, European courtyards, or city-streets?” says the credits and thanks.txt file, the album implicitly tells this story, which I briefly explained in the second paragraph.The game also offers its share of customization, with unlockable cosmetics such as masks and capes. One can also change the default colours of the character model. The game is also a part of Steam Workshop, so people can make their own swords and add to the 25+ swords that the game already has in store for you to use. I don’t think there’s a lack of variety at all, you’re able to customize a character enough to make it your own. And if one is part of a private server, the customization to the whole game is nearly endless.The game is fun, challenging, and beautiful.It's also dead."

It revolved around movement, spacing and combos. The developers apparently didn't want the game to go in that direction. With each patch they've ruined the gameplay more and more. The movement options are now terrible, moves that should combo, do not, and the balancing of the game is awful. Defensive options are too strong and which makes offense too much of a chore. This makes the game slow and boring, unlike the quick, technical oriented style pre-alpha gameplay had.I definitely wouldn't recommend this game to any of my friends. The developers have no idea what they're doing."

(Honestly best!)+Legitimately skillful (supposing you dont have higher than 60 ms ping) gameplay revolving around your reaction times, planning, strategy, and ability to think on your fingers.+Custom servers with unique content enabled change the design of the game, lowgrav makes aircombos (with some ground stances) available midair, creating more intricate and unique ways of play, though lowgrav is dead now.+Character combos are honestly as depthy as it can get, and unless you're fighting a one trick pony, you will need to adapt and switch into different tactics to win the fight, I garuntee it, boss!The sad cons, that we should all understand are NOT REALLY THE DEVELOPER'S FAULT-It sometimes feels like you might be the one and only person who plays this game.-If you are easily stressed/find yourself mad a lot, this game will make you angry. You will lose a lot, it is to be expected.-Weapon types are somewhat lacking, and should change more than just damage values, interval rates, and such. I always feel as though the katana is useless, scimitar is hyper situational, Jian is for pure, and only longsword/rapier work out in the end for stable gameplay. If you're like me and you fashion souls, you wont worry, and will just have a beautiful tool swinging at those nasty little runts!-Perhaps a hidden ranking system, or the ability to not show your rank on some servers. Its jarring when you're oak/iron, and all you see is masters, because you dont want to lose, its a possible reason why our community is so small.-Community is TINY. Even on our recent peaks, we will only see around 100 people at most on servers, whereas mostly its 20-10, its that bad. However, whoever is there is strangely always someone different.-Any lag whatsoever kills the fidelity of the game, on either end. No matter which side is lagging, you're going to lose, because for some reason, this game cannot handle even the minutest change in ping, you will notice that your parries are useless, your gaurd always broken, your back always being stabbed, ranged always hitting, lights parrying balanced, and worst of all, they will almost always disappear when you swing. Its bad, its so bad, but its source, and thats source's horrid issue, best you can do is hope to lead where they're going and always use light/air to keep quick.Some nitpicky issues now.-Characters are all asian, its the game's design style, but its just edgy and silly, boss.-(Weapon) feels weak unless used on (character), every type, every character.-Weapons should be better diversified, and the ability to possibly use a customized, point based weapon type with the only change being a skin might actually seem better than the current system. For example...---Lets say, you just want to make a sword thats good for comboing. You have around 100 points to spam into various attributes, those attributes could be divided into some divisions likeBase damageSide damageAir damageCombo intervalCombo speedCan guard/(whatever rapier's gaurd is)/Feint/no gaurd (for increased points or easier charge)Charge speed/damage modsWhile veterans of the community are K with what we have, this change would bring more uniquity to the gameplay as less cut and paste styles would be present. We're looking at you, JianPure/ScimitarPhalanx.Imagine if you could make a multihit wrecking sword for disorienting and winning through attrition, or a TRUE CHAOS FLAME +5 ZWEIHANDER FOR MAXIMUM BASE CANNON! Or a faster swinging but weaker hitting wep to make Ryoku actually viable and not countered by moving left slightly....Or we could just have less cut and paste weapon types.It might even be a rad idea, to do something like this with characters, mixing and matching combo patterns to weave your own intricate web of butt-touchingly awesome combos that will make everyone on the server mad!---Overall, its a great game, boss! But it has its flaws, and they can get a little jarring if you're not very prepared to face them. I think if more people played it, more love would be seen all around, while I would prefer to see the game change drastically, most people don't and are comfortable with what we have, but I feel that appropriate changes would see a more unique crowd enter to join in on our fun.Its a 9/10 game with a 11/10 community, funny goodhearted people, though few as they be.Now get the heck out of my inn, boss!"

Different types of weapons are available, each with their own advantages and disadvantages, that pair uniquely with the different types of characters available to play. You switch between three stances (light, medium and heavy) which offer different kinds of attacks. It is very simple on the face of it but becomes much more involved, and difficult, in execution – especially when someone else is waving a sharp weapon in your face.The game is definitely a bit rough around the edges but shows a lot of promise."
76561198099112686,Recommended,225600,16406301,"Posted: 14 June, 2015",all,J-Me,"300 hours and I still don't think I've fully unraveled the entirity of the game. That being said, it is extremely complex varying between 5 different characters with 3 (or 4) stances/movesets, 5 unique weapons, and a specific playstyle for each individual. No matter how you come about this game, your form of strategy will ultimately be true to you by the end of the match. Bringing with it, a ""rock, paper, scissors!"" attitude to a 3-D sword game involving finesse and aim, Blade Symphony can quickly turn into a game of wits rather than strats.While being competetive is quite viable, the intense steep learning curve set by ""vets"" and new players whom find arguably cheap strategies can make this ""multiplayer only"" game seemingly unfair. If your looking for a special community, don't get your hopes up too high. While there is a significant number of players who are amiable and didactic, the majority (in my eyes) are complacent and pugnacious individuals who will always find excuses rather than a solution in fighting you. Take this community with a grain of salt. The ""devs"" had walked out quite some time ago due to controversial aspects of the game (as so its said); however they are seemingly making a return. Despite all this, if you invest 10+ hours into this game, you will more than likely develop a sort of crack addiction that can make Lindsey Lohan's meth induced third chin flinch. As you've seen from other reviewers, they range from 2.1 hrs. saying ""dat waz coo"" to 360420 hrs. in dog years going ""IF THIS WAS WORTH 500 DOLLARS ON UPLAY, I WOULD TRADE IN ONE AND A HALF NIPPLES, MY COLLEGE BOOKS, A PINT OF VIRGIN BLOOD, AND A YEARS SUPPLY OF KRISPY KREME ♥♥♥♥ MUFFINS TO PLAY THIS AGAIN.A truly unique game made the Source engine by some guys who love gaming and gaming communities. If you boil down hard enough, this can swiftly take its place in your favourites list for its competitive aspects, as well as casual. Although, a ""casual"" will most likely be overwhelmed by the learning curve; intricacy of strategies, tactics, and finesse; and uninviting, seasoned players. Whether its on sale or not, I'd say its a must have for a more hardy and experienced gamer for this (like Dark Souls hard, etc). This game will make you rage. You will win some, and lose some more. You will lose matches against players who sound like elmo with a dependency on heroine and an obscene amount of gaddamn tylenol where you would rather twist your left nut by gluing it to the bottom of a weed-wacker than lose to them again. I'm going to begin my second round of the game with Nyquil, so if I think sleep is the name of another player in the game who I have to beat before my stomach caves in and eats itself, I'll end up sleeping anyway.Get the Folgers and Monster combo drink ready.

It was fun to play a fighting game that, unlike mortal kombat (in example), did not require me to learn 80 buttons to do 1 move. So I will start with the positives. (long review I know, sorry, if anyone feels these are false please feel free to state your opinion. But this is how The game seems to me and many people I have heard in game) PS summary at the end  (not very detailed but just my opinion on genral aspects I feel are flawed and my suggestion on whether or not to purchase the game)-Characters to fit the individual. Characters have their own fighting styles which players can choose from to what they feel is right for them.-Sword types that have their own unique properties which can be used to enhance a characters abilities depending on their match.-Steam worshop for custom sword skins, because it's nice to have a good-looking sword along with a custom helmet.-Easy to learn combat system- It is nice that opposed to pressing 2 buttons on each side of your keyboard, you just switch between 3 stances and attack while moving in one direction standard wasd and left mouse click. Easy and effective.Now the negatives.-FPS: not a problem for a while, but Many people start to have extreme fps drop and lag after playing for a certain amount of time. In my case i start to lag every 10 minutes, in which case I need to close it and restart steam to fix. Then it will be perfect again, not time consuming but bothersome.-Character moves... Remember how I said characters are unique and fitted for different individuals, well that's a nice concept. If they were not so annoyingly over powered. The character Phalanx can attack at extreme distances that cannot be escaped and are hard to manuveur against, the character judgement can kill in 1-3 hits, Ryo (op as well but hes my character so my word is biased), Pure... not often complained about.-Prior to certain updates some characters had extreme strenghts when people started complaining an update was made that bumped up every character... except Ryo  (downgraded since he was the most complained about)-Horrible parry system as of now. If an enemy attacks and is finished, but still has his sword touching the floor and you jump attack him/her you will be stunned because of the tracers left behind.-Community: okay for the most part many people of high rank always like to talk down to those below them. I Earlier the players were much more helpful and wanted newbies to get better. Not really the case anymore...-ALT-TABS I love this feature taking initeative. This game for me and many other people who have said it in game, always alt tabs for no reason and it always takes like 10 seconds to come back (in which case your most likely dead because the community is full of people who like to attack you while typing, or alt tabbed[maybe an accident but i doubt one who runs away then attacks when you stop moving is mistaken...])-one glitch in city map where you get stuck if on certain side of the rooftop.-Community friendly chat. People are nice to talk to but the conversations are 50% of the time just about how 1 character is too op (then in another server youll hear the exact opposite.) other 50% communit can be quite friendly.Summary:Blade Symphony is a game with great potential and can be a fun game. Ranking system should be, perhaps, more complex as it is to plain to be accurate. The characters are lacking balance and makes the game more about picking a character for each fight as opposed to allowing the individual to progress with the character they like the most. fps issue and certain bugs must be dealt with. Overall broken combat system makes this game less and less realistic as a fighting game (in that I mean this game is currently all about jumping and running around) to include the aweful parrying system and poor tracer effects. Perhaps a game I would suggest to buy on sale as I do hope that the devs will fix these issues in which case I feel this game could be very good. But I would not purchase it at full price. Other reviews may say otherwise but before wasting your money I hope you will take in consideration and actually think about the fact that onky 30-70 people actually play this game still..

I got it.For those who didn't really fall for lightsaber dueling or don't think Star Wars Universe has anything to do with Blade Symphony I'm gonna try and convince you to this game without any further comparisions to my favorite franchise.The whole idea of this game is to create a competitive environment for players to duel with various melee weapons (but really mostly swords and such). The goal was to make it pleasurable, fast, dynamic while keeping it more advanced/difficult than just your average arcade game in TPP where you hack and slash your way to victory.It's a game of strategy, analysis and customizing your gameplay to fit your style. I wanna talk about the latter first: It's really well done, you get to choose from 4 characters, and each one of them has got a completely different moveset and playstyle.I mean it, you don't get two same moves for any of the heroes.I've noticed 1-2 similiar moves but then again they follow up into something else, have different range, different purpose, are from a different ""string"" (I'll talk about it later).If that's not enough for you, you get to choose a sword type - there are 5 at the moment.Each one of them has got different properties and different ""defensive"" ability. You also get to choose what the sword looks like but that's a detail.Let's talk about the gameplay: It's brilliant. How do you mix dynamic fights with tactics? You put 4 categories of attacks, each one of them countering 1 of them, at the same time being weak against another. Attacks also have exact ""trails"" - some leave you open, some attack from the left, some attack from the right, some make you spin and attack everything around you, but there are still openings your opponent can use. So can you. Combat is still fast-paced and you feel the adrenaline rush. Add ""strings"" to that. Attacks come in patterns but you can break the pattern, reset it and completely confuse your opponent. It's truly a game of skill, predictions and observation.Choose the right style, combo the way to surprise your opponent, fake an attack, reset your pattern, parry, use the openings in the opponent's pattern - seems simple, but is ingenious.There are a few gamemodes but really you should know you can take part in FFA, duels (1v1, 2v1, 2v2) and Hero mode. Hero mode chooses one of the players to be the ""hero"" - he gets empowered attacks but all the enemies are trying to kill him at the same time.As for the audio: it's neither bad nor good. I didn't really puy much attention to it and for the most part I just had my own music running in the background. Have to say I've played a bit with the in-game music and it wasn't irritating at any part. Only thing I could wish for is some better hit-sounds.Graphics are just ok, living up to standards but still pretty simple. That's ok, you wanna stay focused on the fights and there's no irritating visual stymulus coming from the game itself. Some of the fighting areas seem a little bit empty and poorly designed but it's not much of a deal at all. Lastly I'll just say that camera work is intuitive and you can actually adjust it in any way imaginable (e.g. angle, yaw, shaking, moving, rotation, height, distance).I can really recommend this game. If you like dynamic sword fights with a bit of tactics you will enjoy this game. It's simple, but holy♥♥♥♥♥♥ in its simplicity it's beautiful."

Ultra realistic (as a game could be) A few stances and almost accidental combos that did exist but where a nightmare to memorise and know when to pull off. The idea was realism in sword fighting. A few tense jabs of tension and then a flurry and someone would be dead or bleeding to death. Ocassionally someone would take a light wound and make a come back, but it was rare. You could run about the scenery for a while, but at some point you just had to assume a stance and swing your sword and hope you guessed your opponents intentions.On the other hand we have 'Blade Symphony' which is basically hop, spin and jab.And a lot of jumping and spinning around, I mean a lot of jumping. The advertisements shows a thing of elegance and beauty that doesn't translate into the gameplay.It's kind of a Manga versus reality situation: and Blade Symphony is totally Manga, If wall hopping and spinning left and right , and VERY importantly: you're willing to put up with no real match making system based on rank - you'll have a hard time finding fellow noobs - then go for it."

Blade Sympony is simple to control but very hard to master. The combos are more in how you use your movesets since  at any time you can use a heavy, blanced, fast and Air not to mentions the air cancel of first three. This is fighing game that gets the complex parts right but at the same time is much more easy to understand the funimentals of combat and excute them over say Tekken or traditional 2D fighters.

There are a few servers with people in but the game says that I can't connect them because they are in a different version (Europe and USA tho), and the ones that are for my version have anyone inside. I don't know why the creators decided to separate both regions knowing that the online is dead...The second one is that the game has any 'solo' mode. I know that is an 1vs1 online-oriented game, but other games similar have a little story for practising or whatever. Blade Symphony doesn't have any mode like this so you are obliged (as the game has a dead online) to battle against a IA that does not suppose much challenge.I was expecting a sale on this game because it seemed pretty interesting to me, so when I saw it on a flash I bought it.

,Recommended,225600,14816363,"Posted: 9 March, 2015",all,Ora,"First of all I'd just like to say that this game is amazing and a ton of fun. If you like competitive games similar to this then you have no excuse but to buy it; especially at such a reasonable price. From what I've played the community has been nice and very helpful, in fact someone volunteired to teach me some of the more advanced mechanics of the game. I've not gotten to an extremely high level within the game, but I can with reasonable confidence say that the game is skill based and has quite the skill ceiling.A warning however is that before you understand the game it could be frusterating for some people since you may not know what you did wrong. Actually I have one tip for people that are just getting into the game, keep in mind that there are three difference staces and an arial state for when you're jumping. Someone can break your stance with an attack from a superior stance, thus breaking through your attack and cancelling it. Fast stance beats arial, medium beats fast, heavy beats medium, and arial beats heavy. Though just because you're using a superior stance than the enemy doesn't mean that they might not hit you first or attack faster, so get used to timing your attacks just right.One more thing about the game is that everyone seems to develop their own unique style of sword play, and by no means are any of them better or worse than others apart from the skill of the swordsman. Not only can you develop your own style of play, but you can compliment it by selecting what character/sword combination you want to use. If you want to be big and hard hitting character and slow but satisfying attacks you can pick Judgement with the Longsword as a devestating conbination. Or if you'd rather deal your damage with speed, then try Pure with the Scimitar. Either way the game will be super fun with lots of variety. (One last tip, I'd reccomend when you first start to pick Phalanx with the Longsword and once you get used to him try other characters with the Longsword. Once you feel ready and are starting to develop your style then try experimenting with differnent conbinations. This is how I was advised to learn and it worked out very well for me.)Past that though, the game is a blast; especially with friends. I'd highly reccomend it to any hardcore or competitive gamer that thinks they'll be interested in the game, and even if you're a casual gamer I think it's worth a try on a sale. Otherwise you're only out 10 bucks (Not the deer).***I apologize for any mispelling or improper grammar, but I hope that this review was a fun and helpful read reguardless.***"

The tutorial is rather brutal, and some players may be unforgiving. But the game is truly enticing. The fighting styles are varied enough so that there is really any number of ways to defeat any number of fighting styles. Battles feel balanced and intense, and the controls are tight, if not weighty.A campaign mode would do nicely, but overall the modes available are fun. The variety of swords means you always need to be on your toes. I personally found very little difficulty in the control scheme; switching between stances helps keep the flow of bouts at a constant pace. With the different possible fighting styles, this game almost requires you to know where your attacks will land and what your opponent will do next.Overall, there could be more to do, but the battles are fast paced and always feel fresh.9/10"

Predictable opponents are still very difficult to defeat despite a built in rock-paper-scissors counter system. Many attacks have a deceptively small range while others have an equally deceptive and explosive range. Attacks seem to sometimes go straight through your opponent. Hit and block stun are well off at times, leaving you vulnerable when you hit your opponent and unable to counter when you block. All of this makes for a highly frustrating experience.There's also a very limited number of fighters to choose from, as well as weapon types.

Save your money and wait till its on sale for $7 - $3As you can tell by my playtime, I’ve played a lot of this game. Hundreds and hundreds of hours and thousands of duel matches. At the time of writing this my current ranked game number stands at 2594 Wins, and 1298 losses for a total of 3892 matches which is 11,676 individual ranked fights.Eleven thousands individual fights, and for some reason I find myself warning you dear reader that this is not a $15 game. I purchased Blade Symphony back in December 2013 for around $7 dollars; my brother purchased the game for $3, and I can tell you right now based on the current game I overpaid.So let’s start with the good: If I’m writing a negative review, then what is keeping me playing.The GoodWorkshop Integration:The current game allows me to create (using various modeling and texturing programs) my own weapons and items. I am one of the more active and prolific workshop creators in this game. This is one of the main reasons I have continued to play this game, as I love to create custom items for people to use. Without this workshop Integration I would have quit the game a long, long time ago.Deep Combat System:This game has the framework for a fantastic combat system, giving you a true feeling of skill when you defeat an opponent. There is a lot of depth here.And… that’s it for the good.The BadThis game has a severe lack of content in the form of game modes as well as characters. I personally have played only one of the four characters in nearly all of my 11,000 matches. The character I chose was unfinished as of December 2013, and is now being released unfinished in May 2014 (the game’s current release date). You heard me: This game is releasing an UNFINISHED character and charging you $15 for it.There are currently only four characters in this game (or 3.5 considering the unfinished/unbalanced character I play. There is also only one way to play the game: 1v1 duel. This is the only game mode you will be able to play at launch and unless you have a competitive streak like me; you will eventually grow bored of this, as 99.98% of the current community has. This game currently has over 30,000 people who OWN the game, yet at peak times US East you will barely find 30 people playing.The asking price for this game is $15, I urge you not to buy until it is at least HALF this price, or even a quarter of this price; because the vast majority of you will not be able to play this nearly as long as I have and you will likely quit within the first 5 to 10 hours once you’ve seen all this game has to offer. I want to reiterate; it was my Workshop projects that have kept me here so long, not just my competitive dueling."

While the sounds are limited to instruments that are blade-like, or actual blades, it's possible to create quite the variety of sounds. After hours and hours of dabbling I've found that the broadsword sounds most like the traditional trombone, and the rapier can be used for pieces such as the flute and drums. Violins are also essential, and require the falchion. Soon enough you too can create works that Mozart himself would be red with jealously for."

What was once a gentle breeze has now become a powerful gale; I struggle to stay on my feet as I am pushed back by this formidable force. White flashes appear overhead. Lightning. I am eventually thrown to the ground by the overwhelming force that nature has struck me with, and I am laid on my back, facing the sky.

It is more deliberate, slower, but also deadlier. A character with a moveset and sword dedicated to slow but damaging counter hits can kill you with a single blow if you screw up your offense. The round's outcome is not decided even if one player has 100% hp and the other has 1%.The way the game controls is pretty unique, it's centered around a combo system with stances and utilizes kb+m so there's definitely a learning curve and it'll take a while before the feeling of jank wears off. But after enough training, you will understand the uses for all of the few dozen different swings your character can perform. Perhaps one move has a fake-out portion at the beginning that baits an attack only to counter it, perhaps it hits instantaneously at your side and catches the flanking opponent off-guard, maybe it makes you hop forward and thus extends your effective range, etc.Because the game has a parry system that lets slower attacks deflect faster ones, the game is rather punishing against button mashing when you have even slightest skill difference between players. Mashing faster attacks is the same as almost begging your opponent to devour your HP bar with one decent counter, while slower attacks can leave you horribly vulnerable and are often not as good when your enemy is right within grabbing distanceIf you got the patience to study a character's full moveset, it's definitely a game worth learning. It's the only fighting game I could call myself even remotely adept at thanks to the very different pacing"

I was a big jedi knight 2 and jedi academy player, and was looking for something similar.  When it comes to sword play thats more than hack and slash there isnt alot out there.  I found blade symphony and gave it a shot.  I think its a very inovative and well done combat system.  I spent some time(an afternoon) offline fighting an ai opponent and then 2 ai opponents untill I felt I had mastered enough of it, then went online.  I can see what some people are saying about this game being hard to break into for new player, but I havnt had much trouble.  The bigest things to remember are distance and timing, which the game assists you with a lot via the blue line that projects the path of your swing.  I was running into players ranging in rank from 200 to 30000, and was able to hold my own against them all.  I still may not know the finer points but I wasnt experiancing these one sided battles Ive read about.I would like to see the devs start to expand on the game more, or expand on the creation tools the players ahve so its a bit easier to create custom skins.

,Recommended,225600,8691788,"Posted: 13 January, 2014",all,Squire Grooktook,"Blade Symphony is a 3d fighting game that ditches the classic ""you're always locked onto your opponent"" movement of most traditional 2d and 3d fighting games in favor of simply moving with the arrow keys/your controllers directional pad and aiming attacks with the mouse/your controllers analog sticks.Though I can see that it seems to be shaping up to be a solid game, and I appreciate more experimental fighting games that don't necessarily stick to Street Fighter styled controls, I'm not quite fond of the ""stance"" system. Basically, instead of having light/medium/heavy attacks, you instead have to switch between 3 different stances which alter your entire moveset. 1 is ""light/fast"", 2 is ""medium/medium"" and 3 is ""heavy/slow"". Each of these stances is designed to be strong and weak against the other two stances in a classic rock/paper/scissors weapon triangle. While that's all well and good, I still feel that having to roll over the mouse wheel to select from 3 stances in the heat of combat in order to get the move you want feels clunky and convoluted. I would have much preferred just having light/medium/heavy buttons. I mean seriously, imagine if in Street Fighter you had to roll over a damn mouse wheel or reach over to the number keys on your keyboard and than do a movement sensitive input every time you wanted to throw a damn sweep as Ryu.There are a few other nitpicks with the combat, though I assume these will be tweaked out and refined with time. At the moment blocking seems to be pretty useless, and since blocking sucks, throws also suck. The game is basically all about hitting buttons right now.Anyway, as for content, the game has a small roster of characters at the moment (about 5 or so), but each of them has a huge variety of weapons to choose from which alter their movesets and abilities pretty heavily. The game also has 2 on 2 matches along with 1 on 1 matches and various lobby settings, so it's pretty decent for online play. Though the netcode is bad.I like most of the music also. The aesthetic is pretty cool too, though Pure has way too much junk in the trunk and her random cyborg ninja fanservice feels really out of place IMO.Seems like a solid game, and one I might return to from time to time, but I really don't like the convoluted design of the stance system. Personally I think Max Anarchy/Anarchy Reigns on Ps3/Xbox360 does pretty much the same thing much better, so I'd honestly recommend picking that up instead if you have either console."

If you were a fan of lightsaber duels in those games, you'll feel right at home here.  For the uninitiated, this is a rather unorthodox and very unforgiving fighting game, with a steep learning curve.  You will struggle over the nuances of the controls.  You will lose a lot of duels.However, once you can get past the initial bumpiness, you'll find that there's a lot of depth.  What seemed random at first actually requires quite a bit of technique and timing.  The veteran players can be very friendly, and will be more than happy to provide advice.  Some servers will even hold impromptu classes for players who ask.As for the Early Access Beta, the game is adequately playable.  There is one character that is still a work in progress, but the other characters have fully realized movesets.  There aren't a lot of game modes, but when the focus is on 1v1, this isn't a big issue at this time.Post-release edit:  The gameplay itself is much more refined after several fixes and balance changes.  Pure's moveset has filled out nicely.  This is still a lean, mean fighting game; perhaps not the most feature filled (for now), but it certainly isn't lacking in depth.  Jedi Knight/Academy fans will be chuffed."

However, I do think I have a decent-enough understanding of the game to recommend it.I began playing Blade Symphony when it was on sale for $3.  For the price, I thought ""what the heck, it's cheap.""  I fell in love with the game!  However, there are a few issues.  I'll list the pros and cons as I currently see them.Pros:-The combat system in wonderful.  It reminds one of the old Jedi Knight II: Jedi Outcast combat system, except much more complex and fluid.-Good community (sort of).  There are a lot of really great people that play Blade Symphony and love to help new people learn the ropes.  Also, there are community-driven tournaments that provide some extra excitement to the game.  I'll hit on the ""sort of"" in the cons.-Steam Workshop integration.  The fact that anyone can make weapons/masks/maybe eventually capes for this game is extremely satisfying and provides a level of personlization that many other games do not have.  I, for one, enjoy beating people with a Candy-Cane Wielding Batman every once in a while.  The Steam Workshop integration makes that possible.-Open Developers.  The developers of Blade Symphony are very open with the community regarding what they are working on with the game.  They have been hosting developer hangouts every Saturday night to provide updates, and I personally enjoy them.Cons:-Some balancing still needs to be done to a few attacks, but it's minor.-Large learning curve.  It took me quite a long time and many, many losses to get somewhat decent at this game.  This is not necessarily a bad thing but I just want people to recognize that this game requires some time to learn and they should not just play for a couple of hours, get frustrated and never play again.-Some dedicated players are jerks.  Now, this will be the case with ANY competitive game.  So please- if you run into someone that is a jerk, do not think that person is representative of the whole community.-The pricetag of $15 dollars seems excessive to me.  I would think it should be more like $10.All things considered, I would recommend this game.  $15 dollars may be a bit much, but it is a very enjoyable and fun competitive swordfighting game, the likes of which I have not seen before now."

I can compare it more to PvP darksouls when it comes to just how the game plays. The controls are a lot different though.  At the moment for an early access game it's surpisingly balanced, based mostly on your personal skill and experience with a character/sword combo. Of course there are a few things that seem a bit out of place. What's neat Is all the unlocks are simply cosmetic, and if you can't afford a new sword yet there are plenty in the steam workshop that not only allow you to see the swod differently, but everyone else in the game sees the same model as you do."

With it soon being 75% off and now maybe one having a taste of the game, this might spike up the players. The combat is very well classed right now of all the people you can choose from. Sure, sometimes spamming is the way to go and can be frustrating to deal with, but the game offers helpful strategies to bypass this. Then after a person learns to mix and match their fighting moves, they then learn which one they like the best.With an interesting plot, good balancing that's simple, and nice play time to boot if there are players to play with, then this game is a must have for a fighter enthusiest."

Fantabulous,"A fast way to describe this game is like Jedi Academy meets Bushido Blade.If that isn't enough then the best way I can describe playing this game is with a story of my first win in a Duel.There are two kinds of servers you can play on, Free For All servers where you can practice and talk to other players or Dual servers where you go one on one in ranked matches.Whilst you are cued to fight you watch however is currently playing. The game operates on a ""Winner stays on"" system so a good player can stay on for dozens of matches. That was what was happening this time I was playing. The player who was controlling the ring was using a rapier, a sword that can break through a players guard easily and get a lot of low damage hits in. He had completely wiped the floor with me the first time we fought and so I got to watch him fight three other players before I got another try.I spent that time watching his tactics, the Rapier is great head on but does almost no damage if you try to swipe with it, so he was forcing the other player to come at him from the front. Either by throwing knives at them when they hung back or by diving in himself. In a sword clash or parry the Rapier will almost always come out on top so he was able to take people down with ease. Over the three fights I watch I figured out a strategy to take him down.I was using the Tone Death, the first Longsword you get in the game which is good for wide sweeping attacks. When the match started we bowed and then I started to circle him, trying to get in a position where I could get around and past his guard. He didn't seem to be expecting it when I finally came at him and, instead of meeting him head on, rolled past his guard and brought my sword round in a wide horizontal swipe that took of a good sized chunk of his health.The rest of the first round continued like that, with me chipping away at his health until he finally fell. The second round started differently, he came right in on the attack, striking at me and putting me on the backfoot. I rolled away as fast as I could to get away from his attack. I managed to land a few hits hear and there but he was hurting me more than I was hurting him. I was going to lose if that kept upCharging up for a fast strike which would take of a huge chunk of my health if it landed, he came around for a final strike. You can shuffle back instead of rolling, it doesn't carry you as far but also doesn't leave you vulnerable to attack. So I started shuffling like a 50's singer and managed to dodge all three of his attacks along with the follow up. In the moment after his attack I brought my blade down it a heavy vertical strike and took of the rest of his health.His body slumped to the floor and I sheathed my blade as I let out a breath I hadn't even known I was holding. I don't think I have ever felt happier at winning a game in my life."

While at first there seem to be not much different fighting styles, an in depth look reveals a very interesting complexity and balance between the fighting classes. While it's still a beta, the game looks almost finished. The community is small but engaged and organize tournaments with prizes.The type of combat may look like Chivalry or M&B, but it's closer to Jedi Academy, as there are 3 fighting stances, Fast, Balanced and Heavy and you can cycle among them in the middle of a combo to make different attack strings. The moves you have depend on which of the 4 classes you're playing, and each of those can choose from 5 sword types which differ in certain attack bonuses (very relevant to gameplay actually) and differ in defence mechanics.In addition there is steam workshop support for custom swords, although these are just cosmetics it offers a very nice visul variation to the characters.So yes, you should play this game, especially if you already like martial arts with swords."

The fighting styles, the techniques, the way in which it's not just continuing clicking on the same damn button as if it was Mortal Kombat or any fighting game that requires amazing combos to beat a person yet they use the same button. ANYWAYS, this game let's you have the fun of kicking someones butt. Despite how many times you're going to lose at the beginning, you'll begin to understand that this game is not easy at it seems to be.Set aside from this, Blade Symphony is a third-person 3D swordfighting indie game which focuses primarly on multiplayer. It takes you to the basics of how swordsmen actually battle. Every attack has an opening so timing in this game is efficent or else you'll lose badly. You choose how you want to attack the person and which every attack, there's a different set of styles depending on the character you chose to play as. Advanced play has been primarily used by players who are masters in this game while the newcomers only know basic mechanics and so on. While the masters use all their flawless techniques, the newcomers would only not know how to time their attacks but also use basic fighting styles with little less combos that create openings for the masters. Many newcomers will not want to learn how to play the game therefore leading them to not only not knowing how to play it but losing in an instant to the masters or other players who had been learning this game for quite a while.Other than that, this game like I said before, I love it. It's awesome. The community in this game is not so mean but at the same, not so friendly. So you could say it's in the middle. I see no reason to get bored of this game when it's gamemode is primarily on multiplayer with Steam Workshop items you could download from. Learning how to play something will increase your benefit of actually having a chance to win at a battle rather just going on full force with one blow.Well, have a nice time in this game and wish you the best of luck!"

The 4 different characters all have a Unique yet believable Fighting style which does suit certain sword types better than others but doesn't limit you.  (The first time you see a knight/samurai use a Rapier like it was a longsword you might laugh a bit.)  There is a character and sword combination for everyone.There are no Upgrades or unlockables that change how you play or make you better the only thing that makes you more successful at the game is practice.  If you make a mistake you will know and most likely lose a large percentage of your health.The community is friendly and if you are having trouble you could join pretty much any one of the servers and ask for help and get it.  Though there still are those few players who are venom (Those who are just rude and sore winners/losers) but for the majority Your duels will always end with ""Good fight!"" ""well played""  ""GG"" ""That was a close fight!""

76561198081660815,Recommended,225600,8188526,"Posted: 21 December, 2013",all,NotoriousDaggers,"Long story short, Blade Symphony is a fighting game and a good one at that.  But a review is a review, so I'll delve into it more.Blade Symphony is a traditional fighting game except the main attraction of it is, as in the name, blades/swords.  Every match is a 2-out-of-3 match.  Your main weapon in this is a sword.  You can do the classic moves of any fighting game, such as grabbing, block-breacking, doing combos, etc.  Also, you do have a projectile, a smaller blade you could say.  But here is a main strength of the game: you cannot spam.  Instead, to throw you projectile, you have to charge the throw.  This is a good feature, especially for fighting game nuts like me since anybody who has played a fighting game online knows there are ""annoying"" experiances.  Not with Blade Symphony.Anyways, you have three techniques to your disposal: heavy, balanced, and fast.  Balanced is as it emplies, balanced.  This means you get a good mixture of some speed and some power.  It's a fundamental skill for not just the beginning of your experiance, but with every match you get into and your future experiance.  Heavy is soley based on raw power, meaning you can completely deplete your opponents health in only a few hits.  The downside is that you are extremely slow and any medicore-timed hit can have the opposition racking up combos and defeating you quickly.  You'll have to know your opponents moves and have good timing to use this technique to your advantage.  And last but not least is fast.  Fast is all about speed. Get a quick combo then move out of range, then strike again.  You'll have to play smart, because the disadvantage is that you have low damage.  Naturally, fast can, in most correctly used situations, dominate somebody who is using heavy.  Make sure that if you're using heavy and your enemy is using fast, switch to fast or balanced.  There are also four different characters to use, though they all depend on the user and how they use them.  You can also download swords of the workshop, non of them being overpowered.The key of every match is patcience and timing.  Wait for your opponent to get within range, then strike according to the situation and their placement on the field.  Blade Symphony is honestly a great sword fighting game that feels like you're actually in the heat of battle.  Use timing, the three techniques, and the character you are using's moveset and strike.  Picking up this game was a real treat, and hopefully it is for you.  Definetly recommended to anybody who has a few bucks on them."

I see that Blade Symphony has tried, and in some parts succeeded, but as a whole package I just don't recommend it for the amount of content it has, along with it's VERY small player base. Want to know how small? Well, if I'm lucky, I'll find 1 server with 5 players on it. That's how small it is. The amount of content isn't up to par with today's gaming standards. Not many maps, roughly 8-10, and the swords and different customisable features are way too overpriced. This problem comes from the small player base. Because, everytime you win a duel, you get ""notes."" Unfortenatly, you need roughly 300-9000 notes to get anything, and this is a problem because you only get about 2-3 notes everytime you kill an online opponent.

In reality, the game is nothing like that.  Yes, the graphics look good, but the rest of the game is pretty horrible.  They have you run through a tutorial on how the mechanics of the sword dueling goes.  They somewhat explain how the different styles work.  Then they throw you against AI to let you try them out.  Afterwards, you are left to go find a match and test your metal against other players.  Finding a match is a bear and because the matches support multiple contestants competing in a 1:1 battle, you usually find yourself sitting around spectating for a good portion.  Horrible matchmaking aside, that's not even the worst part.The game mechanics you learn from the tutorial do not translate well against other human players.  Against AI who react and use dictated techniques the gameplay is fine.  But against users who can change styles, combo attacks, cancel actions, and can move anywhere of their own free will, it's VERY different.   Half the time you find yourself against people who are new (not their fault) and who rage over ""cheap moves"", which are really just the usage of the different ""styles"" to counter other styles (which is a game mechanic).  The other half are people who have realized that they can do things like cancel a combo at a certain time and instead choose a single move.  This means there's no consistency in the dueling.The game sounds awesome in theory, but when they executed their ideas, they did so poorly and without proper testing (I assume, otherwise they released the game knowing of the issues and thought breaking the mechanics they set up was a good idea).  It's really not worth the money.  I picked the game up with a friend and even between the two of us, we had a hard time having fun with the game without mixing in other players.

After watching some videos of the game you can immediately recognise the Source engine, which made me doubt the game a little more. In the end I decided to try it. Aaand... it wasn't a bad choice!In the begining you will propably be the ""noob spamming fast attacks"", but don't worry about that. Don't rush your experience, figure out some moves, watch others as they fight (FFA servers!), ask questions in the chat - the community is really helpful! Most of the players dig the atmosphere of the game - when a duel starts they nod, if a player writes something in chat (hovering icon over head) they don't take an advantage of the moment and kill you. Basically first 5 hours of the game -> 3 new steam friends :DThe game has a role play aspect to it, and I really hope the dev team will consider improving that even more. Blade Symphony is not just about the swords, but it's also about the social interraction.Arcade AspectsYou can play this if you have like 15 minutes of free time, but only after you spend a couple of first hours in the game figuring it out. Many streamers on Twitch just jumped into the game with their friends and quitted after 10 minutes because they didn't have a clue what they were doing... Grab a coffe on a saturday morning and just play through the tutorial, figure stuff out on your own, no rush. After that you will be able to pick some fights, win/lose, have fun, and quit.Technical AspectsBlade Symphony is using a highly extended Source engine. The only features I've recognised it from are the chat and the voip. Oh and the (high) framerates obviously. The graphics are very pleasing for the eye, and the motion blur fits the action perfectly.About the networking - Source can handle pings under 200ms pretty well. This aspect is very important when it comes to such an action game. Above 200ms duels become laggy and you might see your opponent attacking you from nowhere. To overcome that just don't play on Australia servers :DOverallReally entertaining, takes some time to figure out in the begining, great community!"

Pure's moves are all weak, but they string together easily because of the massive reach of her balanced string. That is, unless the opponent is literally running away, which seems to be the current meta. Not to mention her entire strategy, which is to string together combos, is made disproportionately challenging due to the radical inconsistencies in the reach and speed of her attacks, both inter- and intra-stance. This is in high contrast with Vanguard, whose lunging and slashing through both fast and balanced strings remains fatally consistent. Oh, and did I mention that her left and right heavies are incredibly fast and her forward heavy can cross half the arena?Due to the flaws in characters, unreliable ranked servers, and a huge lag in rank updating (the ranked servers even went down while I was playing, reverting many people to Oak and taking away their notes), the ranking system is meaningless. The only tiers that show a slight bit of coherence are Iron (I just got the game) and Master (I'm decent). Even then, some Masters can barely hold a sword and some Oaks are nearly undefeated. Oh, and capes. Probably once a signifier of being a ""pillar of the community"" or whatever, capes hardly mean much. One guy got a cape for helping a staff member find out why his computer was running slowly at the time. Should give you a bit of scope on the situation there, and how much professionalism to expect.Yes, some attempts at balancing is made, but these are sluggish at best due to the lack of speed and professionalism that the staff is known for. And while I won't recount them in detail, I constantly heard of petty incidents among staff members-- tantrums, schisms, squabbles, you name it. Times are grim, and the dev team is much more geared towards changing the game according to an IRC room rather than identifying and solving problems themselves, and possibly with the help of skilled and respected community members.And all that talk about the community being the best? Horribly false, unless I'm overestimating the other gaming communities. Yes, people will tell you how to use certain attacks, and yes, some people are willing to teach you a bit on how to use certain classes, and yes, people bow sometimes. However, the community is still riddled with the same amount of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s and bigotry as any other gaming community. Anyone who reports otherwise is probably just sucking♥♥♥♥♥♥All in all, this game is decaying-- Great players are leaving, ""balance"" is never achieved, tournaments are being cancelled. It's fun with friends, and I'd love to play it if it finally becomes enjoyable with strangers. Get it while it's on sale, but not for $14.99.SOURCES:Personal experience within all ranks, including Master and Oak.Personal experience within all classes, including the new Vanguard.Personal experience in the best and worst servers in terms of connection speed and quality of players.In-game text and voice chats with highly experienced players.Steam text chats with highly experienced players.No, I didn't include EVERYTHING about the characters in here.

They have completely screwed up the game this last update.Now I know alot of people are gonna completely disagree with me, but everyone is allowed to have they're own opinion.In this last update they ruined many things and one being the parkour. You used to be able to scale walls and Endlessly jump onto things and be a total ninja that this game breathes, but now you cant even jump from one wall to another.Why on earth would they ruin such a fun thing to do... Everyone likes being a ninja, unless you're completely boring and have no sense of fun at all. Speaking of being a Ninja.. the only class in the game that closely resembles the ""ninja""is Ryoku. Now there was a huge debate of ryoku being way over powered and blah blah blah.. but really heres the thing.The class isnt overpowered.. Each and every single class there is, takes alot of time to train and get good at.You cant just walk in and expect to be good in 20 minutes... No it takes a while to develope the skills it takes to be ""good"" and even then someone is gonna completely wreck ya. All im saying is its not the class thats overpowered.. its the person thats MASTERED the class... thats why there are these things called RANKS-- oak-Iron-steel-diamond-master. That being said every class has its weaknesses and advantages. So thats where you come and learn your opponents weaknesses and advantages and counter them!  I can think of so many people of every class type who are what they call ""Overpowered"" but its THEM not the class.. so stop trying to modify the game WHEN YOU HAVE DESIGNED IT FOR A CERTAIN SKILL LEVEL!!! -_-Part of the reason they did this update was because of people saying certain classes were to OP than others... Which is complete Bull---- as I just explained.Back to ryoku... The last update they did nerfed the Tracers -which are the lights that follow your sword for a short period of time when you're attacking and also deals the damage- They used to follow your sword for a period of .35 seconds and now is reduced to .15 seconds - Which is a very big difference - Quiet commonly you will see you're sword right infront of the incoming attackers attack.. and you will still be hit by there attack EVEN THOUGH your sword is there.. but heres the thing, the sword isnt really there... the sword does nothing.. its the tracers that they hit. So if your tracers are dissapearing sooner, that meens more attacks hit you even tho they shouldn't, because your sword is RIGHT THERE BLOCKING IT. PEOPLE DONT FIGHT PEOPLE WITH FLASHES OF LIGHT IN A SWORDS GAME... come on man.The sword I use is Scimitar.. that sword has a very low base damage. 50% front attack damge and 40% side attack damage.. where as the Longsword has 90% base damage all around but has no multihits.. Scimitar had multihits and if you did a side attack with a scimitar.. you got a few more multi hits than you normally would. Which makes up for the damage being so low. More hits more damage right? and Ryos side attacks are his most powerful attacks.. and with the right player who practiced with scimitar and got good at it, like I did you could wreck alot of people... But dont think I was unstoppable.. NOT AT ALL. There are like 25+ people in there who could still wreck my butt anyways.. but since they shortened the tracers... less multi-hits, and less multi-hits meens less damage.. and let me tell u. It really ticks u off when u do an attack that used to be strong.. but now does hardly anything.Its not just Scimitar.. there are other swords too that are effected by it.. the whole class system is effected by it.What I dont get is.. This being such a skillful game it is.. Each time they mess with the physics, its like completely reseting your skill level that you had previously and worked hard for. Which is a huge turn off for competitive people who want to play this game.Now the Community...This game is FULL of hateful, disrespectful, rude, and just plain mean people. Not saying there aren't any nice people and fun to get along with.. because there are, but a very low percentage of them.I for one am generally a nice person. I will admit I have been mean before and very hurtful, and to whoever I did that too I appologize even though you were insulting me first.I'm not going to name names, but from experience people in this game will tear you down and make you feel like crap.Thats ALMOST everyone in the game sadly... which is part of the reason why I think our community is so small at this stage of time. i've had times where I've had a rough day and I just wanted to play a game or 2 to get my mind off of things and I would instantly be told I ""suck"" or ""will never get good"" or ""go uninstall the game"" Just because i'd lose one battle. Not even in a ranked match. Ofc this would make me feel discouraged or mad. Not only that but its also another form of Cyber bullying. If I was a new player trying out this game and someone said that to me, i'd leave too.You can make friends in this game and in a week later, just dump you for some stupid reason, if any reason at all..Instead experienced players should encourage and teach the newbies to get better and help them with troubles they are having.. Become tight friends with them and be a Example of what this game should be like. Some people are doing what I am talking about right now, but others dont even care. Most of the top players of the game dont give a crap for anyone but themselfs.If I where the creator of this game I would put in a system that encourages players to help newbies learn the game and rank up. Such as getting a cape or some clothing that can only be obtained for helping a certain amount of newbies get established. I'd also put in a reporting system where if someone is being deconstructive or mean to another personto take a screen shot of the chat and send it to an admin, which then would send some sort of in-game mail to whoever was being mean and tell them to keep it in their pants.If I where the creator of this game i'd also contact some popular game reviewer on youtube to come review my game and publicise it. I know its just an Indie game, but still if this game would stop ruining itself it could be pretty big.Its just a matter of publicity and community.As of right now do I recommend this game... No.. I dont the way the game is heading right now I dont see much light ahead of the tunnel... but if maybe some of my ideas where implimented into the game, then sure, but right now... not so much.I appreciate you reading my review feel free to leave your thoughts and I do expect some jerks from the game to hate on my review, but that simpley just proves what i'm saying is correct.

This is not your typical fighting game despite what you may think. I give this game a 9.5/10 stars on my list. The reason 9.5 and not a 10 is because the little variety of fighting styles it has to offer with 4 characters. Although I suppose it can't be helped. Still, if you have the money you won't regret purchasing this game!"

When you play games like this, you want to become skilled, you want a stats that show you how well you are doing compared to others. While this game does offer that, it offers it in a very lackluster way. To a new player it is very hard to know what server is ranked and what isn't, causing most people to have a bad w/l ratio from the begining. Past that you can ONLY get elo from people in your divison, which is ridiculos. You can lose to someone 3 divions below you, or in return beat someone 3 divions above you and get nothing. Second off your rank is based on your world chart rank. Diamond is the top 2-10%, and master is the top 1%. This means that the longer the ladder is up, the harder it is to get division promotions, what sound like a good thing is acctualy a very horrible thing, as the game does something very stupid to help new players get diamond/master.When you win/lose a game, you gain/lose mmr bassed on your ""expected"" performence against that player. Lots of variables are used, their w/l, your w/l, their elo, your elo, and worse of all... time. If you play ranked constantly you will start gaining little to no elo, making it impossible to rank up.The ranked system is complete trash, you can go from oak-iron-diamond-master-oak all in one day, and it fels extremly unrewarding. It needs a massive improvment, along with a better matchmaking system. Overall its a solid game, but the ranked system is in DIRE need of work."

Very easy to get a hang of the controls. A good amount a blade swing variations.  There are even different stances you can switch between while you are fighting in order to give you 2 slower, more powerful swings or 4 faster, less effective swings.  Brilliant arenas to fight in.

With a community of players whose skill levels range from beginner to untouchable, the level of play is such that after a small amount of time you will be getting the hang of things, and even winning some duels. This game is still in development and the developers really are on a quest to make an evenly balanced sword fighting game. The complaints I have are few and I'm sure will be taken care of before the game is finalized.

,Recommended,225600,7907179,"Posted: 3 December, 2013",all,Guy Duderson™,"Blade Symphony is very technically interesting; as each character and sword offer different speeds, combos and timing windows. Some swords just make sense with other certain character choices, but if you have a basic understanding of what would make sense working together, you will be more than fine. There already is alot of customization options and the devs already having steam workshop compatability just adds so much more being that there is guaranteed to be a blade you can find somewhere that fits your playstyle and satisfies your eyes at the same time.Gameplay is heart-pounding and a definite adrenaline rush to say the least. Especially typical one-on-one duels can end in a variety of ways from being totally swept (happens to me more than I'd like to admit) to having both players dangerously close and the winner only being able to survive another hit before he would have been defeated. Needless to say, very fun and intense.Even the community so far is great to each other and there is alot of respect after fights and funny things people have to say after winning by just that small amount of health.Do I recommend this game? Yes, yes I do. I'm not much of a fighting-game kind of person, especially competitive but the things that set Blade Symphony apart from other fighting games are it's most precious assets, and that is what makes it so engaging."

It takes concentration, technique, strategie, precision, and calm thinking. Other than the fact that it requires more skill than just about every other game ever, it acts just like a brawler game. Customize you character, jump around the arena (I forgot to mention you can run on walls), and reduce your opponent to 0 HP. Each of the 4 playable characters have their own strengths and weaknesses. Judgement hits like a truck, but is very slow and easy to dodge. Phalanx hits hard and fast, but most of his attacks take hella accuracy. Pure and Ryoku are similar in the sense they both use kicks and flips in their basic attacks. Ryoku's attacks are very short range, making it easy for a decent Phalanx or Judgement to pick him off. Pure so far I've noticed has no downsides. Huge range, impossible to hit, lots of DPS. OP need nerf.

The main reason for that was because it said blade and I thought.. why the hell not right? I booted it up and thought to myself, this game probably wont turn out to be what I thought it was. Wrong. This game is more than I thought it was. If you have ever played the game The Deadliest Warrior it plays like that but with a lot more skill involved, and its also a hell lot more fun. The controls are quite simple.. Strafe, move, roll, jump, swing and attack. However, the complexity comes when fighting skilled opponents. Parrying, blocking, and counters are all neccessary to win a battle and I find myself keeping a close eye on my enemy's stance throughout the match. Oh, stances by the way are different attacking styles.. Fast, Balanced, and Heavy.. I'm sure you can understand what each means. Comboing attacks between different stances is part of why I enjoy it. Go it fast, but then turn into a heavy swing to throw them off guard. No fight is the same really. Each person has their tactic, playstyle, character, weapon of choice and so on. In conclusion, this game is great and worth the penny. I do wish there were some more gamemodes.. FFA, Duel, and Hero seem to be the only ones i think or at least the only ones i've played and seen."

Secondly the fluid movement makes fighting hell'a'lotta fun and knowing and predicting enemy movements and counteracting thier style with yours makes you feel like every hit counts. This game is purely unforgiving and any slip ups can mean certain failure so you need to concentrate on the enemys every movement and play tacticaly based on it. If he opens himself up after an attack jump in and smash him, but dont stay in too long or you will get sliced up by his come back slashes.

Dodging is obsolete, wall running never palys any roll in combat, grabbing never happens because before the animation even kicks in the enemy alread akwardly steps away trying to fight the horrible controls, the weapons litteraly make no difference in combat except for f@cking rapier and its gamebreaking fast attack spam (because blocking is not only deleyed but also usless because of the multihits). Dodging is  usless because you will never jump out of the reach of the attack, especially since enemy will just run at you while having the weapon winded for attack and there is near no difference between doge and run, rolling sometimes work but again the distance covered by roll is way to short so you just need to hope that enemy will just miss  and not chase you.

But because of the lack of players They rate down which DOES NOT HELP AND ONLY KEEPS POTENTIAL PLAYERS AWAY(2014)Is it a good game. Yes. Is it Flawed. Yes.Still For it's price i would recomment this game. It's Fun and the combat does not have a extremlly high learning curve. The animation could use some tweaking as they seem quite stiff right now. But as long as the game keeps up with updates and patches, it would be on the right track to becoming a worthey addition to the fighter genre. You dont even have to wait for the developers to really make anything in ways of customization It Has steam workshop suppot which is great and already has some cool stuff in there.Overall is a good game and is a worthwhile addition to your game collection."

The combat system is fun an unique and you have a lot of freedom to play as you like. You can choose which style of weapon to use, each having their ups and downs. Switch between stances (essentially movesets) mid-fight and try to find openings to attack with each stance. You can roam around the whole map while dueling.The character customization is near perfect. You can change the color of your name and armor to anything and there are so many unique things in the workshop for you to equip. There are four classes and unfortunately they're genderlocked, but every class is fun to play and none are too overpowered. Everything is counterable.

The game really shines with its 1v1 duels, with very little lag issues so long as you're playing with low ping, and each character has a unique fighting style with a bit of a learning curve to get used to. If you like dueling in Chivalry and/or Dark Souls pvp, then you'll like this game.The Steam Workshop is also a huge blessing, since you're allowed to download and/or upload your favorite blades for use in-game. Most of them won't be seen by everyone else, but even having them available clientside is pretty awesome.On the downside, it isn't 100% balanced, but that's to be expected from most fighters anyway. The rating system as I write this right now is also a little funky, constantly switching you between tiers and you win and lose matches, but it's not the worst thing I've seen and it really doesn't matter anyway. There's also a lack of content as, outside of dueling, there really isn't anything else to do.Definately consider this one though. I find it well worth the investment, but it's not really for everybody."

After the match, when I asked him what it was, he answered mystically, 'It's called air canceling'. That got me wondering, so it wasn't cheating or lag, but a trick within the game's rules... After a few minutes in the training room, I realized I could pull off the same move with some practice, though using it in a match... Well, that was another story...' Then I realized something bigger, this game was much like swordfighting or martial arts in itself... The only way to reach the next level is to learn with your (avatar's) body, feeling it all through combat.But just how do you recommend a game that's a cross between fighting games and third person action? Well, there's just nothing quite like this anywhere. The combat is a mix of 'FPS-twitchiness' and hack-and-slash, combined with hp bars, rounds and move dynamics of your average fighting game.While weapons differ to a lesser degree, the 4 classes all have a distinct feel to them. But just comparing the diversity of the classes and moves doesn't do this thing right--- There's just so many ways to do battle, spam fast attacks and find yourself countered by a heavier attack (or not if you spaced yourself right). Thought you had it all calculated and fall into an attack cancel, taking a heavy blow to yer face. While the tutorial and basic mechanics feel very barebones, there's just so much to find out on your own, this game would last ages for anyone with even a little competitive spirit.To top it all off, there's free workshop content for customising your look in any manner you like, crazy anime weaponry, cardboard tubes, ski poles and of course videogame swords. Most of the community is also very helpful and there is a samurai-like code of honour when it comes to dueling. The only downside is that the majority of the remaining population has been playing for months now, meaning that any newbies like yours truly will have their bottoms handsomely handed to themselves."

I dunno if it's just that I sucked in the beginning or if you're NOT SUPPOSED to win cos I've had it for a while now and I have just had my first victory online. And that's real frustrating cos without wins you can't upgrade your character.The combat moves look pretty cool and slick and there's definitely some skills to be proud of, but only if the moves are actually done correctly to the nanosecond. If not, you can expect to die pretty quickly in the duals (in training or online).First impressions on the online game lobby were that it was just a mess of numbers and titles. Took me ages to work it all out, so I would not call it new-user friendly.Until a couple of my friends joined, I was losing dual after dual which was a real downer cos I felt terrible.In the training, I can't find a dificulty setting. For some people, this might mean a choice of either: hard, hard or impossible which doesn't really help, unless you got friends who are kind enough to 'train' you in a private dual online.Customization options are pretty decent, leveling up with currency to 'buy' new gear seems fair in most games like this. But if you're like me and suck at the beginning you gonna need a LOT of patience.Tutorials can be a bit misleading; yes, they do teach you how to swing a sword but there's more that had to be learnt outside of the tutorials if you want to stand a chance online. AKA learning the hard way.Suggestion for Improvement:What would make this game a touch more attractive is if at the end of dual, the game played a badass slow-mo of the killing strike, like they do in Skyrim or LOTR: War in the North.Another would be just liven up the online lobby a little bit, when you first enter, it can be like looking at a psuedo-code programming. Black and white, parenthesis and anacronyms everywhere. Just jargon that had to be researched to make sense of.Bottom line: for the adept rpg ""swordsy"" gamer, this game would be awesome. But if you're like me and a newby, patience is key. And if you don't have that, don't waste your shinies on this game cos there are way better ones out there."

,Recommended,225600,10087632,"Posted: 11 May, 2014",all,R1ven,"Blade SymphonyEveryone loves swords. There is just something appealing about being a master swordsman able to slice through enemies like paper. It might just be my fascination with weaponry; it might be that I'm currently watching a lot of sword related TV; it might just be that swords are universally appealing. Whatever the reason, I have desired a way to legally satisfy my urges. The practical output of this is that I will buy almost any game which features a sword as a weapon. In some cases this leads to me purchasing the mediocre/dregs of gaming (Shadow Warrior), but sometimes I end up with a game in which I truly feel like the mighty warrior I am (Mount & Blade). Thankfully, Blade Symphony falls into the second category.At its heart, Blade Symphony is a fully 3D sword fighting game. Its low-key release hides a game which has a startlingly deep combat system. The beauty of the game is in how many options are available to you, and finding your own particular style within that. While the game only offers 5 sword styles and 4 characters, each offers a unique playing style and combination. The longsword for instance is a heavy hitting blade, with strong but fairly predictable attacks. When combined with the character Phalanx, it makes for a long range, but slow jab. Combine it with Pure however and it becomes a whirlwind of attacks, but with less power and versatility. Finding your own style of play really is the crux of this game.The combat will feel familiar to anyone whose played games like Jedi Academy, Mount and Blade etc. Attacks are controlled by movement of your character as well as the style or stance you are in. Light attacks are fast and easy to chain, with heavy attacks taking a long time to wind up, but capable of taking enemies down in seconds. While this may seem simple, stances can be changed mid combo, leading to attacks of varying speed. Thankfully, button mashing is heavily punished, and instead timing and bluffing is the order of the day. Characters warily circle each other before hitting out with a few choice attacks, before backing off and reassessing the situation. This makes fights tense and efficient; with neither player wanting to risk an attack which may leave them open.I say player in this context because currently there is no single player option for the game. Aside from a brief 20 minute training mission, which covers the basic controls and not a lot more, the entirety of the game is online only. There are a number of game modes ranging from the traditional 1v1 duel to my personal favourite the free for all. In this mode, up to 12 players can all enter one arena and battle it out. While this does sometimes happen, what usually occurs is that players group off and challenge each other to 1 on 1 duels while others watch. The beauty of this is it enables you to watch and learn from other players and also use the excellent arenas to form impromptu viewing galleries.The game does have some glitches, mostly with some slight lag and dodgy wall running. While not game breakers they do detract from the overall polish of the product. The wall running in particular seems to have no real use other than being able to climb around some of the maps, but they don't really seem geared to making use of this in any way. It mostly seems to be in place to add a cool parkour edge to the game, but this falls flat on its face. Every time I attempted it in a fight, my opponent would deliver a swift counter and id be dead before I hit the ground. Two of the fighting styles also seem slightly redundant; relying on one set of spins and flips which just gets endlessly repeated. This tends to take the skill out of the game slightly, and is the one area where button mashing can take a slight foothold.As a budget game, Blade Symphony offers a surprisingly robust experience with the potential to become a cult classic. The community are great ambassadors for the game, and show respect to new players, with very little bad mouthing or aggressive posturing. For someone looking to sate their need for swordplay, or someone who has grown tired of the usual COD shooters, it represents a worthy alternative.www.gameaether.com"

Everything from the aesthetic, the performance, the lightning-fast action, the music, the variety of sword and combat styles on display, the different moves blending both realistic sword combat and techniques with some fantasy elements (such as running on walls and aerial attacks), it's all great.However, there is one major problem with this game that hurts it very much - there are almost no players. Only very few people still play this on a regular basis, jammed into the same server, practicing every day/week and not getting any worse for it. The result is, any new players get stomped and beat into submission. The tutorial does nothing (it can't, really) to prepare you for the level of♥♥♥♥♥kick you're going to get before you start to learn the tricks and subtleties that make the difference between winning or getting your♥♥♥♥♥handed to you by yet another longsword-wielding Phalanx. The learning curve is a serious brick wall because of this, and the player base isn't large enough to split people up into multiple tiers based on games played, win ratio and whatnot.This is the only fault I've really come across (other than Early Access Limbo) and there isn't much to be done about it, other than this - which is to say, recommend it.

As much as I like the game, there's simply not too much to do. I feel as if the combat system needs to be a bit rebalanced and added onto. For example, having different styles of attack appart from just grabs and the left-click: maybe like abilities or different types of attacks. Also, based on what i've found, the fast combat style is waaaaaaaaay too overpowered compared to balanced and heavy, when you take latency into consideration.It really is a fun game, in my opinion.

Combos are different for every character, completed through swapping your fighting style from fast, balanced, or heavy movesets before or after an attack. Attacks themselves seem to be 4 directional, meaning there are different attacks for each direction you move, and each with 2 different charge attack stages. Different sword styles also have different stats, and styles of blocking. Some have a full static block, where you wait to defend an opponent's swing; others emit a flash of light when the block button is released, initiating a parry-like block (not to be confused with parrying, when attacks hit each other and clash).VIDEO: Nice looking game, performs very well in intense combat, frame rate never drops. Some community armors look shoddy, but can be avoided.AUDIO: No complaints here, sounds like a fighting game. However, if you do encounter a problem with the audio there are many voice & SFX replacers in the workshop.The soundtrack is great, high octane piano tracks fit the fast pased combat perfectly.COMMUNITY: Although other players can be scarce, the ones you do encounter are generally respectful, and sometimes offer help if it seems you're having trouble getting on the same level as other players. This community also put a TON of work into some really nice looking weapon and armor sets, so the player is always capable of having a badass loadout without spending any Notes."

I have always wanted to love fighting games, but I could never get around the ridiculous learning curve required to memorize and input the button strings required to pull off special moves. I love games that are easy to pick up, but hard to master, and this game is one of them. The developers attempted to recreate the kind of fighting atmosphere that was in Jedi Knight 2: Outcast, and I feel like they suceeded.Basically, there are five playable characters, and each character has their own move sets, as you would expect from any fighting game. However, that is not the most important element of the game. Just like Jedi Outcast, there are light, medium, and heavy stances. These stances are like a rock-paper-scissors kind of deal, and each one cancels out the other. What makes this important is that if you hit a character using medium stance with a heavy attack it does extra damage. Really, this makes the combat extremely simple: figure out which stance your opponent is using, switch to its counter stance, attack. I was able to win a duel in my first play session using this strategy. This doesn't mean you can win by button mashing/spamming, because the more you play, the more you memorize the moves of the five characters, and can easily dodge their counter stances and move in to use your own. This is just a basic summary, because you can also charge attacks for each stance, and there are also five different weapon types to choose from, which mix up the formula quite a bit!There is one major drawback: low player base. Unfortunately, it is rare to see more than 10 people playing this game at one time within a reasonable ping. Once you go over 100 ping the game is really unplayable (which is not any different from any other game), but that is often the only way to get on a server with any players!I definitely recommend that you get it, especially if it's on sale, so you can be part of the solution and increase the player count! you won't regret it!"

With 4 characters offering varying playstyles, no player is left regretting their decision on buying this game. The parrying is very well made and blatantly adds a whole another level of things to master to truly be good at the game. They also offer 4 different types of swords with different statistics to fit the player's playstyle, there are also no bonuses given for those who actually change into a different sword with the same type. All of the swords are just models with the same damage output and playstyle. The graphics, textures, and quality are also very good and the game can still run very well on older computers/non-gaming computers.However, not one game is without flaws. The two problems I've had  are the lack of story line in this game and while I do realize this game was made for multiplayer, it is rather disappointing there is no actual singleplayer other than the practice mode against bots. There are also some RARE game impacting glitches, however they are getting fixed. This is however, rather expected of a rather new game that just came out a month ago. Overall, I give the gameplay an 8/10 and I expect it to become more polished in the future.Community,The community is very helpful and nice. Players will bow to honor the fight has begun. Almost everyone just lets you have a timeout whenever you encounter a problem, whether it be lag or just things in real life. New players will not be left feeling disappointed nor clueless, since other players who are experienced with the game ""spar"" with the new player and tell them what they do wrong and what they can do to fix it. Also, another addition to the game is it's compatible with the Steam Workshop, meaning you can add new weapons and clothes to your character while without any actual bonuses, it still makes you feel like a complete and utter badass. Overall, I would give the community a 10/10Conclusion,For a game that is only $15 I have massive praise for this game for being so well done and lets the community in itself make the new content for this game. The graphics are good, the gameplay is smooth, and the community is helpful, I truly see this as a game any fighting game player would want to have. I give this a solid 9/10"

,Not Recommended,225600,14283339,"Posted: 1 February, 2015",all,Raxyz,"Blade Symphony is those games that have great idea, very original. But suffer heavily on the execution.First of all, the game is multiplayer only. It isn't a bad thing in intself, but it's pretty bad when the netcoding isn't well made.  Any game with more than 50 ms is unplayable, you'll take damage without even seeing the attack animation. There were some pros and some cons I thought of this game, but what made my mind about not reccomending is this. Blade Symphony is a fighting game, like Tekken, Soul Calibur or Virtua Fighter. And even though it runs on completely different rules, reaction time is everything about these games. How quickly you dodge, defend or counter-attack is what defines most of the matches.The second great sin of this game, it's terrible in explaining itself, and there's no matchmaking. Meaning you'll have to play to understand the game and you'll always end up in matches where your opponent plays the game for far longer than you, meaning you'll learn nothing and get perfected all the time. There IS a tutorial telling the game's commands, but that's not what we need to know to actually jump in multiplayer battles. Imagine if Street Fighter had a tutorial like this ""this button punches, this button kickes, this one is used to move character"". And playing with bots will warrant you no real experience of the game either. The bot will just run in a straight line and attack you.So, TL;DRThe bad:-Lag issues-Lacking tutorial-Very steep learning curveIt might be a good idea to get this game to play with friends only, maybe after a while you might learn something. Unfortunately it wasn't an opportunity I had, so I can't tell.It'd be unfair to let out the good of this game though.It has a great idea, of all games that advertised ""swordfighting"" as a selling point, I've never saw one that came this close before. It really feels fresh and original.The community is pretty good for an online game. Although most of them will not actually give you a good help of understanding the game (90% percent of the time I got ""playing is the best thing to do"", the other 10% were gimmicks that didn't worked on higher level players), Blade Symphony isn't the kind of multiplayer experience that seems like a Tourette Syndrome training camp (or Coprolalia if you're nitpicky). The players are most of the times cordial, there's almost no one trying to troll around, and the user-created content is great (I've even had a Keyblade skin).Maybe if this game had a Single-Player mode or mabe even the ""coaching"" option like TF2, I could recommend it, but in 4 hours of gameplay I've had 3 and a half of frustrations. Not exactly what I'm looking for when buying a game. Frankly speaking, Blade Symphony never really left Early Access. It's still unfinished."
76561198003880852,Recommended,225600,7495479,"Posted: 27 October, 2013",all,[TAG]Alblaka,"If you just want a short, quick oppinion: BUY.For the details:This is a 3D duelling simulation. I could say sword fighting, but that just isn't justified. The core of the game consists of 1on1 (or 2on2) duels with a best of 3 rounds system. The rounds itself are limited to 90 seconds, but often they can end in less then 20. Means each duel takes ~1-5 minutes.The fighting itself is fast-paced, takes a lot of timing and precision, but is NOT the buttonmashing combospamfest you would know from other 'fighting games' (Street Fighter, Tekken, Mortal combat).Graphic, Sound and Atmosphere wise you can easily call the game 'beautiful', because that's exactly the asthetic direction it tries to follow. Far-Eastern bells accompany your idle periods and fierce, but 'background-ish' war tunes accompany the duels. The graphics and maps are definitely influenced by eastern sword fighting movies and fit well into the game.However, one of the best selling points of the game: The community. As of now, it got a large boost by the recent launch, but is still comparatively small. However, opposed to most other games, the communityin Blade Symphony is a POSITIVE surprise. On my first day I ran into the #5 ranked player worldwide, who wiped the ground with me and then spent the next 2 hours teaching me the in's and out's of my character. And when he was done with that, he went on and trained the next newbie.Blade Symphony puts a lot of emphasis on that 'beautiful, honorable, gracious' style of duelling, adding a vide variety of emotes, most notable the bow, which is by now common etiquette at the start of ALL duels... and always obeyed. I think it's the atmosphere of the game, the example given by the good players and the way duels are presented that make people actually value the respectful tone of the duels.Of course I must now as well mention it's downsides:Whilst the overall appearance is nice, the graphics aren't completely up to current engines anymore. As well, the animations are not all fully perfect and there ARE animation glitches. Movement along walls (yes, the game permits wallrunning) isn't exactly smooth either (and is really more of a gimmick then an actual gameplay element). The ragdolls are usually horribly amusing, too.Effectively, I could say the whole negative point of the game is that it's a budget game made by an indie developer who has nowhere near as much ressources as an AAA title.Overall, Blade Symphony is, in my oppinion, the single most detailed duelling (/sword fighting) games on the market and well worth both money and time, even more so since it actually comes at a budget price.Rating: 9/10"

It has easy to learn, difficult to master combat mechanics that are for the most part extremely well balanced. In fact, there is nothing in this game that can't be countered or out-strategized in this game, and very few exploits that seem unfair. The true magic here is that even the exploits are balanced. The price paid for this fine balance is that there are only four characters, but they are genuinely different and equally viable characters. Get fluent with the controls, and they can become an extension of yourself. That is more than can be said for most fighting games.Learning the game past a certain level can be a traumatic experience, and one area the developers should work on is improving the offline training facility and tutorial. It is not adequate, and venturing into duels with only the current offline training is suicide for all but the most twitchy ADHD junky. The best advice is to proceed directly into one of the FFA serves and talk to people, learn the ropes there. The community is your best friend here. But nothing beats the adrenaline of fighting duels, and that's where the true test of skill comes out. The community will not be your best friend there. They will poke you to death. I will, at any rate.About that  community. At least in Australia, it is a model of what an online gaming community should be: hilarious, obsessive, friendly with just the right number of trolling ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s to keep things lively.  The game modes might seem limited to 1v1 and 2v2 duels, but there is a lot of fun to be had in player-organized events, especially if you like some chaotic fun.Lastly: the action is fast and relies on very narrow windows of opportunity, so there will be issues if you try to play it with a high ping. This is a recipe for frustration, and the best attitude is to think of ping as an additional, advanced challenge. Seek out a server with low ping to learn, or most of the subtlety and elegance of the game will not be apparent."

76561197998135402,Not Recommended,225600,13804796,"Posted: 3 January, 2015",all,Shiroka,"Blade Symphony is 3D Duel Game (like 2D Beat em' Ups).It offers 5 different Character each with its own Moveset. Those Moves are divided into following ""Stances"": Air, Light, Balanced and Heavy. Each Character can also be customised with different clothes and SwordsYou can mix attacks in with every Stance. For Example: From the Heavy Stance you do an Attack, then switch to Balanced and make another 2 Attacks and then switch finally to Light for final Attack.All the Characters has more or less Slots in the Stance, which determines in which way you can cross the Stances. For Example: Phalanx has only one Slot in Heavy, which means you can only do a Heavy Attack at the Beginning, after that switch to Balanced or Light.Each Attack can also be charged for maximum Effectiveness, which is different for every Slot in the Stances.You can also choose between 4 different Sword Types: Katana, Longsword, Jian and Scimitar. They have different Moves  and Properties which alters also the Moveset of the wielding Character. Training is recommended to get a feeling for each Sword.Additionally other Swords can be purchased through the ingame Money ""Notes"". These Notes you can get after winning DuelsBut there are at the moment negative Points which comes to my Review why i dont like it:Spamming Attacks:Basically, in the Duels the Players spammed only Charged Attacks or the same attack and didnt rely too much on Tactics which is fundamental in Duels. This ""Tactic"" allows you to win almost every Time if you have the right Character and Timing. This Tactic is used by Beginners and Pros as much as i saw in my playing HoursIn one Fight i tried to rely on this Spamming Tactic without thinking on Defense. The Result was, that i won a fight with a ""Pro"" in less than 10 Seconds. Using Tactic or timed Attacks and Avoiding has slighter Winning Chances as this Spamming. There are no effective Counterattacks since Blocking (Only Longsword i think it was) doesnt block every Damage and you get ""Chipp Damage"" (Damage that surpasses the Block and damage a little the Health). Maybe other Pros use more Attacks and real Tactic, but as far i saw there was none of this.Realism:The Moves are somewhat stylish and sometimes over the Top, which comes to the Point that the Developers should have thought in which Direction this has to be. My Problem imho is, that despite maintaining realistic feeling of Swords and Stances it doesnt cope well with the stylish Moves on some Characters (Ryo). As far as i known, they are not Cyborgs. This ruins for me the Atmoshpere since it doesnt decide which way it should take.For Example: You can throw Daggers/Axes/Shuriken/etc. on your Enemies but you have unlimited of these, so you can spam those infinitely which annoyed me on some Battles who Players throwed those at me all the time.Some Minor Points:-You get pretty slow Notes for buying new Gear. After 5 Hours i had only 201 Notes. Some Swords cost over 5000! There is much grinding in this Game to get new Swords.-Each official Map has only 3 Arenas, so if 12 or more are connecting you have to wait a while and wait in a Queue.   There are some custom Maps with 6 or more Arenas though, but arent really that pretty as the officialThis concludes my Review. Hope this helps to someone out there"

You spam the move that spins the most and think you look ♥♥♥♥ing cool but just get killed 2 hits. At this point the game is frustrating but interesting at the same time.Once you start asking around and practicing, you get an idea of whats going on. General idea about the classes and swords begin to set in and some of your beginner mistakes fade away. Here you start feeling good about yourself and want to learn more.Then you play against Masters and climb the leaderboards. You hear them talk about the game balance and you notice these problems yourself too. The game starts getting a bit stale and unbalanced but you can still play casually, right?Then it hits you. There are at most 20 players online. 15 of them are Masters. You either get really ♥♥♥♥ing good at a game that is dying or you act like a retard and use a cheesy strat just to win. Then you look back. You don't see the Irons you were fighting with when you first started out. They didn't come this far. They thought the game sucked because they lost a lot.They weren't too wrong. The game has severe balance issues and a very big lack of players. Blade Symphony's new player cycle goes like this:1 - Start game, like it2 - Play online, get destroyed completely by masters3 - Either give up or get a bit better4 - Get destroyed completely by masters5 - Either give up or spend your time and effort getting really good at a dying game.Most people just leave after stage 2 or 4. There isn't really a future for this game. The community basically consists of fresh players and really experienced players and very few of them even want to lose 3000 duels in a row just so they can get good at a dying game.It gave me a couple good weeks when it lasted though, I'll give it that."

The only problem is...It's completely and utterly dead.This game thrives on the online community, which is entirely non-existant, except for maybe 5 or 6 people in a single server, and even that many is a miracle in itself. You more than likely won't find any more players than that, and there really is nothing else to do in the game. Honestly, if this game had a thriving community, I would recommend this to everyone, but it's dead and most likely won't come back.I do not suggest buying this, since you'd just be getting an over glorifed tutorial for a game you'll never be able to play to its maximum potential.

That's the common comparison.Every attack should be strategic and thought out, but due to several moves being broken, terrible and sudden latency issues or frame drops, and overall terrible hitbox detection....you're going to end up using maybe 1/5 of those moves instead just so you can finally hit your opponent.5.5/10Amazing idea.

The forum is a troll haven for those cliques and mostly one of the most unfriendly MP atmosphere's you will find on steam, which is bad when the game is MP ONLY..lol. you also need to understand priot to purchase that this game is over as far as the Devs are concerned. their IS NO content, nor will there be. no campaigns, no storyline, no single player modes or any other features what-so-ever. you have very nice graphics, 4 premade fighters you can choose from, you can outfit and get workshop weapons for them. you can do the tutorial and fight against bots in practice mode. (which they seem to frown on for some reason, probably because you aren't in their servers as cannon fodder for them to earn 'notes"" which is their currency used to unlock more weapons and so forth). and that's it. Redo the tutorial for 500 hours or in practice mode and you supposedly will then be able to 'hang"" in the very small circle of elitists that are left in the MP servers. so when they say MP only they mean MP ONLY.so i redid this to make it very clear, practice and tutorial will get you no currency, there is no levels, or upgrades or any othat stuff. it's a small MP community only game so be aware of that when you make your purchase...if you want straight up swordplay fighting i suggest Mitsurugi Kamui Hikae, it's at least a satisfying little indie game for single player. If you do like MP then of course this is a really beautufl (though devoid of any other content) game. But just really make sure you understand the limitations of the content before wasting your money and investigate the community you will have to rely on for ALL of your gameplay as you may find the atmophere a no-go = you are stuck with a bare game and no place to play and no other content to justify the money spent. except fo course, playing practice mode with your character."

But as it is now? Not worth $10, at all.I understand and acknowledge that some people enjoy this game, and I don't fault you for it, but this game has some major drawbacks, and it's only fair to include them.Are they based on opinion? Yes, what review isn't. Freedom of speech is a thing, guys. The internet would be rather boring if you were only permitted to post positive outlooks.Graphics:Graphics in this game, are decent, with polished textures. However, the animations can be a little underdevelopped, such as running, but what do you expect from an Early Access game? I'm sure they'll tweak it once the game's fully prepared. However, in terms of graphics in general? They're not too bad, and are acceptably merciful to a system to allow some pretty nice eye-candy, without the crushing frame rates.Mechanics/Game PlayThis game has a very innovative, good, and interesting concept, and it is definitely a reason for it being so popular. A game which is entirely about duelling with swords, combining styles and stances to create your own personal sword fighting technique, and testing it out against other players' own fighting styles. The concept was a sell to me, and after watching the preview on the store page? I had to give it a shot.But it is really painful, to see that the execution of the concept, is sorely lacking ;~;I hope, yet again, that I can just slap the 'EARLY ACCESS!' sticker on it, and expect it to get refined in the future. Don't get me wrong. I 'want' it to get refined. I 'like' this style of game, truly, why else would I have it!? But right now, the mechanics are bulky at best, and require some intensely impressive keyboard sorcery to manage the wrist breaking controls effectively.Stances are options to increase the level of customization you can do with your technique, enabling you to pick and choose what attacks work for you, and which don't. Something I personally have trouble with, is the way you change stances. Considering how they expect you to change stances 4-7 times depending on the level of difficulty you're trying to master, and that you either change stances by the 1,2,3 buttons, or scrolling your mouse wheel? When you have to move around to keep yourself out of your opponents reach, it can become difficult to both manage WASD as well as 1 2 3.They have also added some eye-candy features to the combat styles which, I think, are honestly not neccesary, such as flashy dance-type animations that makes it take longer to actually strike. The female character in the game, appears to be dancing more than fighting, and it quickly gets frustrating when your 'to the point' opponent strikes 5 times where you strike 3 times.The choice of swords you can use here is actually pretty awesome. No 2 swords are identical, and to add some extra customization options to your style, you have around 4-5 different types of sword to choose from, such as standard medieval long swords, to japanese katanas, to central european rapiers, and more. I actually like this idea, but what I don't understand, is how they've decided to base the general 'combat style' (how your character moves) on what character you choose, not what weapon.For example: I like the look of the female character, but I don't really like the way she fights, her spinning and jumping etc. It blocks the view, and makes it less enjoyable, and harder, for me personally. I much prefer the combat style of one of the male characters, who does dashes, and super quick forward attacks. I wish the attack patterns were based on the sword type you use (Slashing for Katanas, thrusting for rapiers, and a jack of all trades for the longsword). I personally think that'd make the game more fair, and add another element of customization.Instead, you're forced to choose your physical appearance based on the character's fighting style. I don't like this too much.Lore/StorylineFar as I know? There is none. I havn't seen any evidence yet of a storyline to explain the appearance of the characters, why they're fighting, or what the ultimate goal is, nor what their pasts are. I may be wrong, and simply missed it(I plan to give this game some more time to redeem itself to me), but black on white, I can't find it. As an RPG/Lore fan, I like when my game has an answer to the worlds simplest question, the first question a child asks after grasping the basics of speech: Why? A game that cannot answer this question, or won't answer it, cause it considers it redundant, or pointless to the bigger picture, is not a game I'm very interested in. A game where you're given an armor, a sword, a place, and an opponent, and expected to simply raise your sword and strike them down, because that's just the goal of the game? I apologise, but to me, that's just shallow, as I like to know 'why' I'm raising my sword to strike them down, before I actually do it.Overall?I won't recommend this game, RIGHT NOW! Since it's in early access, changes are bound to happen, and just like with Warframe, the much desired melee combat rework was done in combat 2.0 recently, which made the game far more desirable, and true to its nature. This game? In my opinion it needs alot of work, both in balance, concept reconsideration, and immersion. As it is now, the game is trying to do too many things, much too quick, and it makes the game appear as if trying to be made of gold, when it's honestly just a really fancy brass.As is, I can't claim it to be worth it's pricetag. Perhaps if it was free? I'd say its worth a shot. But if you want a game with fun combat, and customization oppertunities? I'd rather recommend Warframe for you. Somewhat the same concept...Samurai in full body armors that're customizable, who can pick and choose weapons. Except Warframe is primarily Co-op player(s) vs. AI, whilst this is kind of like Warframe's PvP brother, Player vs. Player, little to no A.I.Hopefully, I can make this a thumbs up in the near future. \o"

Learning your opponent and their devious ways in well-timed sword combat is extremely rewarding. This is coming from someone who dislikes both fighting games and competitive multiplayer. The tutorial isn't very in-depth, so I would almost say skip it until it gets expanded upon (remember: this is early access) and just learn by playing. The combat is very timing-oriented and button mashing is very unrewarding as your enemy will quickly get around you and remove half your health before you complete your button mashing combo. Learning how to trick your opponent is also key. The only real gripe is that latency feels like it can be an issue with some misses.Get Blade Symphony. I give it 4/5 carboard rolls."

Each fighter has a specialization in some area of combat (speed, damage, etc) and each sword provides their own movesets and styles. Some blades are meant for parrying, some for guard breaking, some for pokes, etc.The really mindblowing part of the game comes from the combat mechanics themselves. Various stances outplay others, in a rock-paper-scissors manner, so maintaining a balance in a fight becomes essential. The arenas are very open, similar to Soul Calibur, but with free movement, going back again to Dark Souls. Character customization is extremely in depth, with a ridiculous number of workshop skins that look fantastic. Servers are active (currently 7/14/2015) and able to accomodate as many as 32 players in a single lobby (although combat is still 1v1).If the game has any flaws, it would be balance issues. While I imagine it's bloody difficult balancing each and every sword when they can be wielded by each and every character, I sometimes feel like I've had as much luck button-mashing as I have playing a certain style.Should you get it? I don't know. If you like Dark Souls PvP, I'd say absolutely, although the price is a bit much for what feels like not enough of a game.

There are still mindgames involved mind you, but they are all different, depending on the playstyle of whoever is fighting.The fighting feels good. Even if they tell me one of the characters isn't quite finished, she still plays quite solidly. The sound assets do feel more squishy than meaty, but that's to be expected. IT's sword fighting, and the sounds work really well. And when you do hit, especially a hit with judgement, it just feels good. Flames from your sword, the opponent being knocked back quite a large distance... It just works. And the music just tops it all off.Anyway, for those of you looking for a sword fighting game, if you remember bushido blade(note, never played it myself), then this game is just straight up your alley. Even if it isn't truly one hit kills, fights are still deadly enough to be a concern for the player you're facing off against.But, I left something unsaid, didn't I? Well, the game seems easy enough to grasp, but is still tough to understand. You see, timing and precision comes with practice, and isn't easily gained. I lost a lot of fights before I grasped how it actually all fits together. But now, I'm doing pretty well. I still have my faults, but I play far more solidly than I did starting the game. So, if you don't mind being beat on at first for quite a large chunk of time(it could even happen 5-10 hours in, though Your Mileage May Vary).But, there is another downside I have noticed... The tutorial doesn't explain everything. I don't remember if they explained that charged attacks can have different attacks, but I do remember not seeing the avoid commands in the game: Roll and step. Both are done with ctrl and shift, respectively. Incidentally, stepping can be done by double tapping the direction you wanna go.despite that, I can definitely recommend this game, especially when you love going at it in PvP. The game just works very well."

It has a large option for combat moves and is very beautiful when on high settings. I reccomend this for people who like strategy games as well as action. But we well aware that it's hard! REALLY HARD TO BEAT :D

,Recommended,225600,9180669,"Posted: 19 February, 2014",all,YA BOY BARKO,"I found blade symphony surprisingly enjoyable. a small-league early access game about pure, unabridged swordfighting. i figured that it was infinitely better than torchlight (I was right) and tried it outmy first impresions were bad because the game was laggy, and had more bugs than a starship troopers movie. it was in its infant stages though.I picked it back up so see if it improved and did it?it has its own workshop, if thats not testament enough, I don't know what is.The game has a really simplistic art style and theme that is more or less a combo of cyber-martial arts in a modern setting, not much to scream about but thats because its background. Blade symphony's main call is gameplay.its a multiplayer only game where two or more people must duel with swords until one winsand gets eaten by the Nidhogg. there is no simpler way to explain, no story, no war, just simple, one on one sparring with swords.the selection of swords is satisfactory, with the player being able to choose between four styles of blade, each with their own attributes and styles, and to then extend that, a selection of four characters who again, have their own fighting style, making for 16 different combos of ways players can fight.the best thing about the game, however, is that there is no overruling tactic. every style has a weakness (several, in fact), and every sword has a counter. its all up to player skill to beat the other guy in pure unbridled sword combat.should you buy it?Yes. it really tests your wit and is quite fun."

The controls take a while to get used to and since it is still early release there are bugs to be fixed but its fairly fun. I say you have to be dedicated because it takes hours of gameplay (unless you happen to be naturally amazing) to get good. It takes hours because you have several characters to try out and several weapons to try out with each character to see which is the best fit for you. Then after all that you need to practice to that you can actually beat other people.
