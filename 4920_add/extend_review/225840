The graphics are dated but the AI is pretty good. I heavily relies on cooperation since the enemies are hard to take down on your own, hence the name Sven Coop.The thing I dislike about this game is that it is not obvious of what the gamemode the servers are.

,Recommended,225840,30028903,Posted: 19 February,all,gnode,Half-Life multiplayer with lots of laughs and entertainment. Basically like Garry's Mod with Half-Life one hundred percent intent of being Half-Life. People recreate the story line and make more. Outstanding for youtubers making humorous videos.
