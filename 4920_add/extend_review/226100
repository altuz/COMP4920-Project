They mostly never tried it but all thoses who did liked it.The game Launch like a terraria map where you gotta start every time from scratch* with a factory and explore to find ingredients. Once you're set up, you have to defend your soup factory versus, kinda pirate, I dont know the name but they basicaly try to eat or blow up your base.It mostly base building, base defence, exploration and trying to mix up new combination of ingredients. where the game, get more complex as you unlock more options, ex. vehicles or new robots.The game have a harsh while cartoony embience where you have to compete with rival company as an astro-worker and your boss just want results, he dont care that much about you but you understand this with a type of humor that is quite chaming for a game.This is a sample of one of the jokes you face early on but in my words: Try to not die, every time an astro-worker dies, I gotta fill up a ton of paper and it cost me money to get a new one.The art looks like additions of simple shapes to make your average object with colorfull background that change with planets, The pieces of factory you use are always the same color but as you place them, the art change with a tube placed on one side or the addition of a fan etc..., it not much but it get the job done and I did enjoyed it, the robots you use and your caracter are slightly less squared that the rest of the game but not much.The online is weak not due to a bad interface but more because there isn't that much player at any given time that play online and it a shame for the effort that was given to make it simple and working. when you do manage to find some one it half of the time some random dude at the other side of the globe and when it does happen, the connection is as bad as the sexyness of a blobfish. If you play with friends nearby, it can support up to 4 players.*I said from scratch but you do unlock new technologies with completed games.** Sorry for my bad english if I made some mistakes, im french but I wanted this to reach a broader audience."

The mechanics are solid and fun.I saw it compared to things like Terraria and Starbound, and while that isn't incorrect, it's not quite right either. This isn't a sandbox  game. At the time of this review, there are ""levels"" and a finite play time.The game is broken down into days with the goal to get 100% of the market from your competitor (which as far as I can tell, is just a virtual system selling soup rather than a physical entity playing in your map). For instance, there is no enemy building a base and harvesting resources.When the day is over, you are transported back to your base to start again, some of the monster spawns and resources will have changed. I couldn't tell if it was randomly generated or based on some kind of ecology.After completing the mission the game does allow you to go back to your mission and ""continue to play"" however, you can only play one day at a time because once the day is over, it quits you out because you already have 100% of the market share.I'm not sure where they plan on going with this, if it's a linear experience or if they do plan to add more sandbox elements in it like the other games in the genre.From what I played I enjoyed every bit of it, but am a little let down on the fact it isn't an open ended, indefinite game type. Maybe that's my own failings for not doing enough research, but I would love to see the polish, art, and mechanics of Nom Nom Galaxy to have a sandbox mode.At this time, it's realyl well done, but there isn't enough content to warrant the sticker price, so for that reason I cannot recommend the game. Hopefuly when more mechanics are added, levels, or what have you, I can reverse my position."

Can a feature be implemented when it's full on the next day? Would remove some of the hassle from wasting potential ingredients on a start of a new day just to get their health back to full.-Implementing a way for Charlie and Charles to use those floating elevators? They seem to be stuck to the platform they travel back and forth on-On that note, perhaps a system that allows the the player to take the current ingredient out of their hands or swapping it with another ingredient, e.g., if they're running back and forth with a ingredient that can't be used for a soup dispenser yet because that soup dispenser is waiitng for another ingredient.Bugs-I'm not sure if it's a bug but sometimes after planting mushrooms or other plants of any sort, they dissappear after a few days, is this meant to happen? If not, then this needs looking at.-One instance when I was invaded, after a enemy died and a rocket turrent just fired a missle after it died, the missle image stayed uprght as it homed to the where the enemy disappeared.7/10Recommended Purchase.Needs work to get it sparkling but what is there, is already solid.Looking forward to what else they have planned."

The gameplay, while resembling Terraria and Starbound, has a much faster pace to it with the day/night cycle and the daily scoreboard pushing you to want to do better with each passing day.One great thing about this game is that it constantly had me smiling and laughing whenever I would come across a new enemy, a new type of soup or any other entity that came out of nowhere.

Menus don't store settings correctly (I have to change the resolution/aspect every time I open a new session) and a number of controls haven't been transferred across properly; most menus are still labelled with Xbox-style toggles, and some fairly important functions (like an in-game pause/settings/quit menu a la 'start' button) just aren't there.For a game that's based completely on platformer carry-and-throw, it's anyone's guess where most of the objects are going when you throw them. A step to the left or right whilst in a corridor can make items fly backwards out of your hands, straight up, pretty much anywhere but where you were actually throwing them to. 'Automation' also moves so slowly that it's often faster to walk everything around yourself.Even single-player matches are constantly interrupted by 'night' every few minutes, and multiplayer sessions (even over LAN) frequently desynchronize and drop.In short, it's an Xbox party game that's being sold as a PC adventure game."

I'm a fan of factory games, 2D survival, and platformers- this should have been right up my alley. However, the entire game is a bunch of good ideas that are executed amazingly poorly.On the plus side, the art is quite nice. The backgrounds are richly detailed and animation quality, while choppy at times, is consistent and pleasing. The music is nice and never feels annoying or repetitive during the time I played. Presentation is good across the board.The mechanics are where the game breaks down. There's too many to list here, but I'd say almost every single aspect of this game is executed to a lackluster, and possibly even lazy, degree.> You can build robots and conveyer belts to automate your factory- buut you never will because the robots are slow and idiotic, requiring mass numbers in order to even attempt efficiency.> You can discover interesting new combinations of ingredients- buut just creating as many variations on the most common ones is far easier and more efficient than scouring the map for anything rare and non-renewable. (Not to mention that more valuable soup doesn't seem to affect much: mass numbers seem way better).> You can construct a tank to help collect masses of ingredients- buut it's ridiculously expensive, slow, and only slightly faster than doing it yourself.> You can use special power-up gums to improve your abilities- buut you likely won't because their effects are temporary and not very useful (other than negating fall damage or loss of oxygen).> You get attacked by rival factions, necessitating defence- buut their pathing is so bad that by setting your base underground and walling everything off with blocks, they'll never be able to get at you. Also the turrets are terribly bad at aiming, meaning you'll have to defend everything manually anyway- which is GREAT if you were exploring already.I could go on, but I think I've given the gist of why this game eventually bored and frustrated me. There's some fun to be had here, definitely. I have 9 hours on record right now and I don't regret trying this out, but I do feel disappointed. The slow grind to get upgrades, the terribly implemented mechanics, and just the reptetition that sets in really can't save this game.It's a series of good ideas, executed poorly.

You then have to rinse and repeat until you have 100% market share over your competing soup making companies.Pros: Really fun risk reward gameplay with a good learning curve and freedom to complete each area as you please.Cons: Controls can be mapped a bit strange but you easily get used to it.

Nom Nom Galaxy's zany mix of intergalactic soup production will keep you up later than you should be in the never-ending quest to find prime ingrediants and shuttle them to your soup factory.The split-screen coop is a blast, too, my 5-year-old nephew really enjoys playing with his uncle, although he's quite capable of ruining our factory by accident, probably best for 8 year olds+.  As an adult, I enjoy the aesthetic and challenge of cleverly utilizing the factory parts.The main downside of the game is that the scenarios are a bit prefab; you can launch right back into them with your existing factory but then the challenge is gone because the opponents are simulated with the assumption you started with nothing.  Once you've beaten the scenario, you can switch over to an unlimited time mode for unlimited building, but there's little point because the sense of challenge is largely gone."

I have played PixelJunk's other games on the PlayStation platforms - PixelJunk Monsters was my favorite. I bought this game early, based on their previous work. I played for this game for a little bit, but never really got hooked. I loved their distinctive art style, but didn't really have much fun.Updates came and went, but I didn't go back to the game.Fast forward a couple of years. The game has been released, and patched several times. While looking at Factorio and Rimworld, I remembered that I had this game already. Loaded it up, and started a few levels. This game is a lot of fun!It is like a lot of other crafting/base-building games. Crashland on a planet, start building a base. Mine resources for money to expand your base. Use the native flora and fauna to make soup, and then launch the soup in a rocket to feed the hungry citizens of the galaxy!There is a more compelling gameplay loop now. You're trying to make soup faster than an off-screen rival company and put them out of business. Add more soup machines to make different flavors of soup. Variety increases market share. Add more rockets to ship the finished product faster. Start growing more ingredients to make sure your supply chain is feeding all your machines enough raw materials. Automate your production with robot workers and conveyor belts to shuttle around ingredients and soup cannisters.As your market share increases, the rival corporation will send coporate raiders - literally. You will need to create base defenses so the aliens don't come and destroy all your hard work.Instead of being thrown in the deep end with endless menus of tools, the game gives bite-sized chunks so you can learn and perfect your infrastructure. The ""aha!"" moments from getting conveyor belts and robots right is really rewarding.At first, I thought that restarting my base from scratch was annoying. However, I quickly realized that there were more efficient layouts. A base layout that might work on one planet may not work on another. Building a soup empire from grasses and vegetables will be very different than building a base from mushrooms and underground creeper vines. Killer tomatoes make great soup, but you'll need to create a herd of them that will sustain your soup production without overwhelming and kiling you.There is also a sandbox mode if you want to just keep adding on to the same base. I am still progressing through the levels, so I haven't started a sandbox-mode planet yet."

It's super cool and the design is raw, but overall pretty complex. The possibilitys are almost endless and every new planet got a new, hard mission to get over! After every planet you got a new technology which would help you to get your next base even better than the old one! I'm thrilled to see how it will be in the end!BUT there are some things that really made me... sick, kinda.1) My movementspeed and jump speed is nothing like the videos. I ran around with about 30% of the speed shown in the videos. Also climbing and exploring was super ♥♥♥♥♥♥, so you basicly placed your base where you landed and took everything you got there and planted your own garden aside.The buggy thing around that was, that after I ALT-TABBED out of the game and went back, all movements were on 200%. I kindo ran around like a leopard on steroids. Weird, need to get fixed.2) Exploring was not possible. First, the movement i mentioned above. Sedond: Your low air limit. After landing, you had about 5 minutes to find a place either to build your base or, if you were lucky, you found air. Air was pretty rare on most of the planets I was on, so i HAD to build my base, or I let myself simply die to respawn with less gold and stuff.3) I was stuck on a mission (on Ordsok, you have limited rockets to get your soup out). I destroyed 2 rockets by accident and had the problem, that I didn't get out of 70%, since the enemy always shot his rockets to keep me there and my soups only gave me +5%. So i started running around and colecting all new things to get new recipes. I got over 15 new ones over the time and, in the end, I won.Suddenly a message was shown, that I ""achieved everything in the Early-Access and got every technology avaible"" (remember, I was on the second planet of the second universe, I had like another 8 missions to go through). I was stunned, but sad, because I loved to look out for every new planet to get new stuff. And now I have everything and the fun to play the game and achieve more things really stopped, I don't even want to play the game anymore, the story mode was all that kept me here (because of the problems above).PS: It does show, that the game has 32 achievements.

I absolutely cracked out on Eden when it first came out on the PS3.Nom Nom Galaxy is PixelJunk's latest game, and its something different than theyve ever done before. Its a sandbox Terraria-like game.You own a space-soup-making company, and you must travel around building soup factories and exploring planets to find ingredients to make new receipes and keep your market share high. To do this, you explore planets in a 2d environment, build a soup-making base with modular parts and ""matter"" you dig out of the ground. You are going to need soup refineries, soup rockets to send your new creations to market, and even defenses to protect your base against invading rivals, Therss also both local and net co op and multiplayer, a free build mode, a ""conquerer"" mode, something like 100 soup receipes you can make and even more I havent found yet.Wait, what??Yeah, just bear with me here.

I'd like to revisit this game when (or ratherif) it's more polished.Pro'sFunny visual style.Enjoyable soup production management. It's cool to try new recipies and see how the market reacts.ConsOnline multiplayer apparently doesn't work. I can't try it because nobody plays. That's a shame, because that's one of the things that attracted me to the game when I saw the trailer.Every 5-10 mins or so ""night falls"", resulting in the statistics for the day. You then continue to play the next day. First of all, this happens way too fast, but also all resources that were not picked up during the day despawn. That ties into the next point...The game is all about automation, but the AI doesn't work too well. There is a robot for planting and a robot for harvesting ingredients, but more often than not one of them fails to do their job properly (they just idle around), leaving resources on the floor. This doesn't only ruin the whole ""automation"" aspect, but the resources also despawn like mentioned in the previous point. This unfortunately completely breaks the flow of the game. This is a point that's been discussed in various forum posts and also attempts were made to fix this, but it seems to be in vain.Was this review useful to you?Please check out the Izzy Reviews Curator pagefor regular updates on reviews for other games!"

While we had a really good session on release, this game has been less stable since.  While playable - the game has network issues as well as a few problems with the way it handles multiplayer generally which kill it's long term appeal.  While these were to be fixed with a patch - that patch never came and I must correct my review to reflect that.  If they do fix these issues then I would heartily re-recommend this game.After starting a multiplayer game there is a period 'in time' where the render and netcode feels 'tight' and together across all the players.  After a short period it will appear to restart the game and  resyncronise.  We are now out of time with each other, the game plays in a slight slow motion and the rendered screen feels behind with the state of the game on the network.  So while at 60fps the effect is of being in a laggy slow motion.  This did not occur at release quite quite as it does now.No real thought has been given to coop play.  If people join my game they do not gain the unlocks and progress that I get - this is just half finished.  The devs have said that this  would all be fixed in a patch months ago.********************** original reviewBought one copy to check the ""lag even in local coop"" - didn't have any so bought 3 copies to play with gf and brother.15 minutes later we are making soups together-  no problems whatsoever.My machine i7 GTX970, brother AMD 965 with GTX670, gf (laptop) Core2Duo GTX650m.  No lag, no frame rate issues.I seem to be the one that likes to automate the corridors with robots and work out new soup recipes, find out which sell for the most, but also to keep the variety up (if you keep making the same soup you will lose market share eventually).  Meanwhile my brother is making security arrangements and building underground ingredient farms.  Meanwhile gf is off exploring and finding new ingredients - and better sources of existing ingredients.We fell into it really naturally - I really think this is one of the best, truly co-operative games I've played in a while.  I doubt it'd be as much fun if I had to juggle ALL those roles - but playing with friends that each have a 'thing' they want to get into is wonderful.I started to give more and more direction to my team as I worked out what we needed from my soup research - and the guys really liked fulfilling those missions to find more cornbugs - or workout a better way to defend the conveyor belts so the soup doesn't backup.We haven't unlocked anything much - but we played for hours - just exploring and (for me) mapping out all the different soup combos on the first map.  Can't wait to play more.Thoroughly recommended"

(No spoilers!), Or you can scroll down to the pros and cons. :)You start of with your friend (or alone), wow, your a bad pilot, your ship crashes on the planets surface... You begin mining for blue stuff (Don't know what it's called) to build your office, which is the start of your factory, if it gets destroyed you lose, (or your troll-like friends break it with there buzz-saw). You build a soup machine which creates soup! There are lots of recipies, some give more money and some give less. There are right now around 40 ingridients, some are rearer than others. But around different planets there are different resources. You build that rocket and you SEND that soup to the sky! Once it comes back you are free to send more soup!But hey, that seems too simple? Don't worry, there is another company who will compete with you for stock market and they will send raiders to destroy your factory and more importantly your office! Also some ingridients are difficult to farm, they might be spikey, they might be plants, they might be monsters which will fight back as you hack at there nest. Or even space pirates!At the start you don't have much technologies, but the more planets you conquer, the more technologies you unlock, different planets give you different technologies. You start with manual labour for that sweet sweet minimum space wage! Until you get enough techs so you can automate your factory and have robots work for you with awesome names to make them memorable! You can also buy turrets to protect your precious factory from invadars!This is really great to play with your friend. The more friends, the more fun, up to 4 people max! There is also weekly chalenges which chanlenge you to compete with other factories for galactic gums, which are really useful buffs to build your facory.Pros:-Fun gameplay-Amazing coop experience-local multiplayer support-Lovely GraphicsCons:-Your internet should be at least 1 mbps, unless you want to do local coop-You need friends to play with-Singleplayer gets repepetiveAs you can tell this game is based heavily on multiplayer.8/10 - Would delibretly deliberately crash rocket again."

Automating the factories speaks very well to the pipeline technical artist in me. There were a couple of issues with the dog bot not doing its job properly, but just takes some working around.The enemy attacks can get pretty tough and annoying in some stages, such as the ones with the guys that come dropping bombs and are very annoying to kill. But overall it's quite alright, and by then you'll have enough money to start your defenses.I think there should be more rewards for doing different kinds of soups. You can go by most levels by just mass producing the same soup, which is a viable alternative I guess (and done in real life) but would be more interesting if there were added bonuses for doing the rare soups, other than cash as that can be farmed pretty easily.Great game though."

Keep up the momentum please!Edit July 30th: My friend and I have been running into performance problems when playing Multiplayer (different computers, same room and WiFi). It usually starts off flawlessly at 60 fps for in-game day 1-2 or so. We start to experience problems after that. Some include dropped FPS, random day start animations (that only sometimes reset parts of the world), and network connection issues.Game framerate is also tied to the graphics framerate, which causes a slow-mo effect. At 30 FPS or less, that makes it unplayable. It wouldn't be as big of a deal if it was just choppy, but slow-mo is terrible for gameplay."

The gameplay is very basic, and the game itself is very poorly optimized. In just one hour I had the game crash three times.

,Recommended,226100,16049503,"Posted: 28 May, 2015",all,Note,"(My previous review of this was pretty meh. Here's to starting over.)Nom Nom Galaxy is an interesting take on all of the Minecraft/Terraria-like game. Instead of a seemingly endless adventure or quest to do, you instead complete several levels making soup, unlocking new things along the way. Your goal is to basically create enough soup to beat your opponent, all the while upgrading your soup production and protecting your base with robots.Each planet seems to have a certain generation to it instead of randomly generated levels, which I found a tiny bit disappointing. It'd be cool if the landscape and ingredients changed up, even if it was a side level away from the story mode. That aside, there are still tons of planets to go to, some even including restrictions like low-gravity or not being allowed to create extra soup rockets to send soup, so that makes up for the lack of randomization.The controls are okay but can feel a bit awkward sometimes, especially with mouse + keyboard, but it won't take too long to get used to them. With that said, it's probably better to use a controller for this game. Sometimes everything can feel a bit floaty but it's not too much of an issue.I've also seemed to notice a few strange glitches while playing which aren't too awful but are glitches nonetheless. Sometimes the game may crash when on the main hub area or you might ping off somewhere else since you were in the way of something getting built. Stuff like that.Overall, this game's a fun change from all the sandbox games coming out. I'd probably watch a few videos to see how everything works before getting it. To be honest, I'm a fan of Pixel Junk (and Q-Games in general) and bought the game since it looked cool to me. Either way, Nom Nom Galaxy's awesome."

I'm not fighting a game all the time but those CONTROLS. Can't recommend it right now, but I hope this will be fixed for people with more than 2 fingers (e+left mouse). Is that so hard to separate kicks and robot controls? Every time I'm fighting someone near robots I need to reconfigure all those robots sh*t again - move them around, switch up/down direction. Building controls is another problem. When I'm clicking Ctrl on tower and then move left to reload it, I'm actually moving left in addition to reload. And what if my tower is on the cliff? I'm FALLING DOWN!This game not in early access now but it's still annoying as hell. I just rage-quitted this ♥♥♥♥♥♥-controls crap.

I heartily recomend it."
,Recommended,226100,17356822,"Posted: 2 August, 2015",all,YellowReggae,"An interesting and fun game that will please any fan of the PixelJunk series. The visuals, sound and mechanics are all awesome - as per expectation. The lack of full tutorial since the last update is a bit of a problem, but once you pick up the robot-automation mechanics yourself and start using them, the game becomes a very exciting experience.My biggest issue, all that said, is that there doesn't seem to be a relationship between the scarcity of the resources and their value. Sometimes the easiest to create recipes yield the greatest payoff, which leads to you going through the same motions level after level, relying on high paid recipes rather than being more imaginative.It doesn't quite feel like the game achieves the gameplay it intends to generate. It's like 80% of the way there, which is sad as it is unlikely to have many gameplay-related changes now that the PS4 version has been released. I hope that the game is successful enough to justify a sequel as I love the potential game here, but as it stands, it leaves me feeling a little unsatisfied. Still - a definite recommendation purely based on its uniqueness and style."

Add a log please.- Tutorial is a bit lacking. Explains the basics, but missing a lot. For example, does it matter if you make the same soup all the time or many different soups?- Give us a soup chart with numbers! There is a huge chart of what ingredients make what soups, but you have to hover them one by one to see their value.- Table view for soups that can be sorted/filtered by value, ingridients, etc would be great to help making decisions.- Automation is nice but a bit too simplified. Very hard to make an efficient factory without being able to tell the robots what to cary, etc.- A bit too easy... I always win on my first try.Overall this is a great game, lots of enjoyment.
