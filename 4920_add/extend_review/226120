,Recommended,226120,12423146,"Posted: 9 October, 2014",all,KestrelPi,"I have heard this game (favouribly) being compared broadly as a kind of 'space solitaire' game. But it doesn't look or even at first blush play like solitaire, so I want to explain why the analogy works for me:In solitaire, you have the same 52 cards, arranged in such a way that their order is different, so sometimes you might get snuffed out early by an unlucky deal, and sometimes you might fly through for victory - you don't really mind which, because games don't take long so the stakes never feel so high that you'll never play it again.Weird Worlds shares some of this in common. The star system is filled with mostly the same items and hazards, but the order you encounter them switches out, so in one play through you might have exactly the item you need to best deal with an encounter, and another time you might not.This means that a lot of it is luck based, but half the fun is replaying the game and seeing where luck will take your exploration of the galaxy this time.That's not to say it's all luck - fitting out your ships with the best gear takes a bit of decision making, and it's possible to learn the function of special objects to understand whether they're worthless and tradable, or could come in handy. Plus the real time combat segments are basic, but reward people who avoid combat before becoming sufficiently tooled up.Occasionally, too, the game likes to switch things up by layering a 'meta' plot, usually difficult to resolve, above the usual exploration. Some sort of crisis which the player must solve in order to score a 'win.' These are rare, but always welcome.Like Solitaire, this is an ideal game to kill a short space of time with, but better than solitaire, it rewards repeat play with just a modicum of depth to be discovered beneath the surface."

,Recommended,226120,33067675,Posted: 30 June,all,keithieopia,"Weird Worlds is a remake of an older 2002 indie game called Strange Adventures in Infinite Space. SAIS was fairly popular back in the day of Palms, Pocket PCs, and PDAs. It's meant to be a fun little distraction in sizable chucks perfect for a lunch break. To give you an idea, SAIS's tagline literally was ""Explore the galaxy in 20 minutes or less!"" Weird Worlds is basically SAIS plus more content.With the above in mind, a lot of reviewers are somewhat unfairly comparing Weird Worlds to FTL. If you're looking at it as a FTL clone, or an immersive game you can play for hours, or a game that requires great strategy, you're completely missing the point.On the other hand, if you're feeling nostalgic and want a faithful sequel to SAIS, or a quick game you can pickup and put down, or a distraction to escape the drudgery of boring work, Weird Worlds is perfect for you. If you're still unsure, go download SAIS; it's been open sourced since 2005."

It's quirky,  and as everyone notes, a quick play to fill some time.That said - after a handful of play throughs, there just isn't any meat here to chew on.  I tried a couple short games to get the hang of it, but you can't built your ship up enough to withstand any battles, and the game is over so quickly, you better not stray too far or you'll never make it back to base in time.Playing longer games was a more enjoyable experience.  Here too though, I found it very hard to survive virtually any combat encounter.Other than combat, all there really is, is going to each planet and putting whatever ""thing"" you find there in cargo, every once in a while trading with a wandering store - presumable trading up for more points at end game.  Then even at end game, there's no  winning in the classic sense, just a final tally of your credits based on what you found minus what you owe.That's pretty much it unless I'm missing something.  I generally like quick time fillers, and I love quirky games, but I just can't find a way to like this one.  I don't regret the couple bucks to play it a while, but I doubt it will get much replay from me."

Once you engage you better hope you judged it right.I love turn based 4X games (Xplore, Xpand, Xploit, Xterminate) and this game feels like a light andcasual Xplore and Xterminateversion of these games (there is no settling or empire building, just increasing fleet size and customisation).I play it casually but may be sucked into an hour long game if things are going well and I feel a high score coming on. Since it is turn based, I have the luxury of taking my time to consider each move and weigh my strengths and weaknesses. It is still hard to judge the relative strength of more evenly matched battles and so I still get wiped out occasionally with much chagrin! The special missions that come up can seem over whelming and only recently did I beat the bugs 1 on 1 in a fair fight.I now start with all the difficulty options on max and with a military mission base ship (I preferred scientific at the start to focus on the exploring). I find theEven Wierder Worlds modthe best extra content without making it easier (Esmarelda can take ANY item - cargo or equipped - and often a best gun!).After >200 hrs it is really just theprocedurally generated maps and trying to get the ""perfect"" gamethat keeps me going as well as mods to change things up.

It has an excellent atmosphere; from the quirky bits of backstory to the memorable snippets of country music you sometimes pick up while drifting through the void, it does a great job of creating a unique 'feel'. The combat is unforgiving and forces you to truly consider the consequences of every engagement, but a bit of cleverness and careful planning can help you avoid combat entirely if you so choose (and on many runs, that's exactly what I did; combat is not by any means central to the game). I love how the various random items and their lore interconnect, and how exciting the storylines have the potential to be, in what appears on the surface to be an aimless journey. The final boss, simple as it was, is possibly the closest thing to 'epic' that I have ever seen in a game.So yes. If you like roguelikes and want to try something that is more about exploration and thinking creatively rather than just killing everything in sight, check out Weird Worlds."

Though Weird Worlds predates FTL by quite a bit, both games seem to scratch the same itch; scaleable, randomized play sessions, ship cargo and weapon management, choosing the best route through the map, offbeat sci-fi humor.  There is a slight learning curve; equipment is fairly random throughout your route, and combat is pretty rough until you find some allies.  This is definitely one of those games you play five times in a row just too see what else is out there and how far you can go!Also, don't let my short playtime on Steam fool you.

You chose one of three space ships, then configure the galaxy, and you're off. You have so many years to explore the galaxy, collect booty, meet people, experience the weirdness, and then to race home before your time limit runs out. The rules become very clear and you see the limits you have to work within, but everything is shrouded in mystery until you discover all the details by experimenting. The space battles have a tactical component, but it's often better to avoid combat until you've found a lot of allies and better equipment. This is a psuedo-turn-based game. You select a star system and travel, at that system you are given a choice of engaging a race, collecting booty, or experiencing an event. When you engage in combat it becomes an rts; guide your ships to where you'd like to position them, select your targets, and use your abilities.There's something compelling about the gameplay, especially with how quick the game is, perhaps it has to do with how easy it to die when you know you made such an obvious mistake. You can play this game without actually engaging in combat, which I find refreshing. This isn't a game you can play for hours. After you've really gotten it down it's fun for a game here and there, and when you've burned out on it, leave it hiding in your library to be rediscovered.

In that regard I am partial to any game where one can play a starship captain.  As I have little time to game, I also gravitate towards rogue-like games.Weird Worlds is exactly that, a rogue-like game of space exploration, adventure, and combat.  Procedural generation keeps the game fresh and adds a great deal of replayability.   The price is reasonable and I am eagerly looking forward to Infinite Space III to reach full release."

Plenty of replayability... another game I wish I'd got more copies of while it was on sale so I could gift it out.Non-spoilery-Protips: Click on your ship and/or cargo icon in upper left to open those windows (I keep mine open pretty much all the time on high res settings)."

,Recommended,226120,24547980,"Posted: 26 July, 2016",all,Shagie,"This game is a quick, light space exploration game with some intresting mechanics. Certainly not a game for everyone.I first played this game about a decade ago - and so there's probably a signficant nostalgia compoent to my review. Games that were new and innovate then are tried and boring now. The ideas that were found in this game have made their way into other games - ftl and Sid Meier's starships are two that immediately spring to mind.This game is not complex. If you want a complex spaceship flying around gamemanyothers in that realm.It is not epic. The games will be a few minutes long.  The game is that of fly around in one of three space ships (different configurations), find equipment andstuffin various systems, try to improve your lot in life, and get back to your home star beforedinnerthe game timer ends.So, I like the game. I think that its at the right price point. Its an inexpensive indy game from a decade ago. It's not something that will take awhile to play. It doens't have hard choices. Its a fly around, get stuff, get back.When viewed in this light, the game is worthy of a recommendation.I'd like to point out a on that comparison to solitare that has been tossed around. Back in the day you'd find a copy of solitare on every windows machine sold (and pinball and hearts). One aspect of the comparison to solitare is that of ""this is a game that should be part of the 'every machine sold' package circa 2005-2006. The comparison is that of the 'a quick light game that you can play in a few mintues, or multiple times.'"

I like the sound design in all it's simplicity (space radio-chatter etc.) You keep going to find the (rare) ultimate spacecraft and special wormhole to the other dimension to fight the end-game boss. My second favorite space-solitaire after FTL."

Definitely something big in this small package. The UI is not that cluttered. Only what is needed is displayed.
