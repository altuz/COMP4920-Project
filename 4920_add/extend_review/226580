Really like this feature personally- New cars, liveries, tracks, generally looks more streamlined and visually appealing- Handling/braking feel better and more realistic than previous versions (to me anyway)- Cheaper price than previous versions at launchCons:- New game coming out early in 2015 so unless you're a diehard fan of F1, probably wait until then- Small steps and improvements from previous versions, nothing gamechanging- Would've been nice to see scenario mode and/or season challenge extended in some way so they're not something you just play through once and forget aboutIt's a solid game, my initial impressions are it's pretty good and worth buying if you like the F1 series. If you're just a casual gamer and occasionally play racing games then I'd probably wait until the next one comes out."
,Recommended,226580,12534357,"Posted: 17 October, 2014",all,[CASH] Synister,"First off, let me open by disagreeing with most people's statements of ""it's just 2013 but with new engine sounds/team rosters/tracks"" while yes, on the surface, it seems that way, however, when you dig a little deeper, it's oh so much more.for this review, I'll begin with Pros/Cons, then go through each of the main focuses of negative comments about the game.Pros:-New Turbo engine sounds are awesome (in my opinion)-The handling rework has made the game so much more about skill now. 2013 required a lot of skill to drive, but 2014 makes you re-learn all the tracks with added braking zones due to the new car physics.-The AI is now extremely competitive, and will give you an even greater challenge while racing.-Young Driver Test: out, single lap of Monza with the option to skip: in. Frankly, I found the test to be both rewarding and infuriating in 2013. most challenges in it were fairly simple and easy, however, when it came to getting that one silver medal converted into gold to unlock all the teams at the start of career, it got rather frustrating when it got to a point where I simply couldn't squeeze any more time out of the lap. This game, however, has you driving a single lap around the Italian GP circuit of Monza which you can even skip and select the game difficulty yourself.-Career mode now has the option of Short/Medium/Long career featuring 7/12/19 races respectively. So if you want to race an F1 career, but don't have the patience for the entire calendar, then you can miss 7 or 12 races out if you like.Cons:-Codemasters is very limited (much in the same way as EA is with Fifa) that they are contractually obliged to release a new F1 game every season, no matter how much/little has changed, which explains why 2013 and 2014 are extremely similar.-Some would've liked to see a new UI (I'm fine with re-using the old one, I'd rather not have to re-learn where everything is in menus as well as having to re-learn how to drive properly)-Mercedes is stupidly OP compared to all other teams.-Still no formation lap prior to the race and no podium scenes-No F1 Classics this seasonNow the Pros and Cons are out of the way, time for some issue addressing.-""It's Exactly the same as F1 2013""Wrong. it isn't. Why don't you go ahead and do a lap of Monza on F1 2013, then play 2014 and try driving the exact same lines at the exact same speed as the previous game. I guarantee that 100% of the time, you'll massively understeer at the first of the Lesmo turns. The lower downforce on the 2014 cars is really shown in the game, and credit to Codemasters for their execution of how different the handling has been this year. Additionally, as I stated above, Codemasters (or whoever holds the contract) is obliged to make a new game for the franchise EVERY year, no matter how much has changed within the sport, so you can't always expect a game that's drastically different to the previous installment.-""There's no KERS""Wrong again. What F1 2013 fans know as KERS, is now one half of the new ERS (Energy Recovery System) The KERS part is now known as MGU-K which draws energy under braking, and MGU-H draws energy from exhaust heat. While in 2013, the drivers could choose when to deploy their KERS energy, in 2014, from what I can tell, it's all controlled by the onboard ECU chip in the engine, which utilises the additional 33 seconds of increased horsepower as and when it needs to. So before you go moaning about the lack of deployable KERS, try watching an actual race and see if the drivers are even in control of their energy deployment.-""The menus are exactly the same""Yes... they are, but as the saying goes, if it isn't broke, don't fix it.-""The Williams livery isn't right""No, it isn't, this is because Codemasters were unable to secure the rights to use the Williams Martini livery, so they used the alternate livery from races where advertising alcohol is banned.-""What happened to F1 Classics mode?""This was asked on the official forums, and the response was ""Because this year's cars are so drastically different in performance from the old cars, we have chosen not to include classics in F1 2014""This is about all I can think of for now, but if I can think of anything more than just needs to be mentioned, then I'll be sure to edit the review (mainly after I start playing multiplayer more)"

Yes, there are going to be a LOT of similarities to 2013, because as someone else pointed out, F1 is F1!The difference in the car handling/sound etc from 2013 is very realistic. (Those complaining about the assistst, turn them OFF in the options!) (Those saying there are still assists present, where???) (Those complaining about traction control, well...TURN THAT OFF too!)The physics & handling modeling are very good, I was just driving Monaco, started in damp/wet conditions on Inters and could ""feel"" the car improving as the track dried, and this transitioned upon chaning to Options. Oh, and love the random birds flying around, nice touch.I do have a few complaints, mainly realism complaints...Where are the marshalls? Also, the cars seem quite tough, luckily for me haha, and I've failed to avoid someone elses debris a few times and not suffered a puncture, again luckily.There are a number of things I hope have been added to 2015 though, more back game play, ability to ""wander"" round the paddock and have to endure the journalist's questions, ""shaping"" your drivers charecter and how they are viewed publicly, and privately by other drivers, a little more ""politics"" that translates onto the track instead of driving against a bunch of mindless opponents. Surely it can't be that difficult to factor in the drivers' style and approach to their AI counterparts?The racing, so far, they have got pretty bang on...now time to expand the rest of the game :)Edit: I've just seen a marshall! Hanging over the barrier at Monaco :)"

,Not Recommended,226580,12688400,"Posted: 29 October, 2014",all,Nebula|Scott,"As you would guess. This game is basically F1 2013.5However Codemasters are the only company in the world who could copy and paste a game and still make it worse.Sidepod glitches are worse in my opinion while Autospin curbs still exist and the online is more unstable than ever!For the record. The game is still quite fun and challenging to drive on the wheel, however pads have InBuilt traction control which gives them zero wheelspin and better tyre wear. In wet conditions the gap between the wheel and pad can be as large as 3 seconds, which is simply crazy. This is making league racing almost impossible, which is the only reason i play the game.Codies have had 5 years to improve, the game however has made no significant improvments, While luke spring, Steve hood continue to ignore all of the community and continue to make broken games!F1 2015 will be on a new engine (So they say...) So this for me is the game that will make or break codemasters f1 games. The chances of a improved game are slim, but we can only hope!"

As someone that has played F1 2011 onward this is somewhat dissapointing, it's far too Arcady for me, F1 2013 was a good challenge, this isn't, even with all driver assists off the car is easy to control. The steering does not feel connected to the car at all, when I'm stood still and I turn my wheel 90 degrees, the wheel in the car does the same, when I'm moving this is not true, there is still assistance on the steering and it really frustrates me. I never know how much I need to turn the wheel to go through a corner, because it changes depending on how the game feels.It's a big shame, but save your money and get F1 2013, or for a really good experience, iRacing. Hopefully CM will fix this for F1 2015, but I won't be pre-ordering this time."

,Recommended,226580,12519346,"Posted: 16 October, 2014",all,VICTORINO,"I have played all of the Codemaster F1 games, and most F1 games going back to the Geoff Crammond series. I would say I have a long view of the genre at this point.With that in mind, I would say that this game is quite good, and continues the incremental refinement that the series has enjoyed since 2010. You may have seen that the series has gotten lower review scores year after year, and that has more to do with the nature of yearly sports releases than anything about the game itself. 2013 was clearly a high point for the series, and it didn't have the scores that 2012 had, despite having tons of classic content, as well as a decently fleshed out career mode. One of the few shortcomings of the series is the continued lack of telemetry, which makes car setups a little less scientific than they could be.Codemasters have a fantastic physics engine, and have successfully modeled these new engines and that just-on-the-verge-of-snapping-the-rear feel that this season's pilots have to deal with. Lots of fun. The tire models have also changed, as in real life, with much more predicable, though probably too conservative, tire life (at least for my taste).The classic content is missed, along with the Young Driver Weekend, though I still have F1 2013 if I ever get the urge to drive Niki Lauda's Ferrari at Estoril, Portugal.If I look at this game without any prior context, is it worth it? Certainly, yes. It's a stripped down F1 game, no doubt, but when all of the rule changes, engine outputs, tire compounds, etc., it's quite a feat that Codemasters was able to release this game during their usual release window at all. I'll definitely be looking forward to F1 2015 which promises a bigger evolution in presentation. I give this an 8/10 so far.A final note: I loved the Geoff Crammond games, but anyone who says they were superior has selective memory. They were amazing for their time, but do not stand up to today's racers."
,Recommended,226580,26438525,"Posted: 5 November, 2016",all,Poky,"Last F1 game on older engine, hence pretty much the only option for people who want V6 hybrid era F1 game and their PC is unable to run newer games well. Generally speaking at it's release it was very lacking in terms of content and features compared to packed 2013, but don't let that stop you from buying this game if you fit into group mentioned above - it's great option for people who don't have powerful enough PC to play F1 2016 (best one to date).AI in this game is surprisingly race competent after first two laps - in first lap it straight up sucks no matter what difficulty level, but then it's actually quite fun to race against as long as you follow clean driving rules and don't try to scare them off with overly excessive weaving or real-life banned blocking moves.In terms of racing performace, game specifically follows 2014 rules, hence cars feel damn heavy, slow and sometimes more annoying than fun to drive. On the other hand though, setting consistent fast laps is definitely more challenging in 2014 compared to any previous Codemasters F1 game. The game itself provides not much content beyond standard 2014 season racing, but don't let that scare you off.As I said, this game is the last one to make use of old engine, and that also means that it's the last one that is relatively easy to modify, and that's where this game's strength really comes up. You can mod everything from driver's performances to tracks, cars, pretty much anything - although models wise you are limited with what Codemasters made in their previous F1 games.That itself allows for alot of fun though - you can mod in 90s/80s seasons (that is if you don't mind track/car model inaccuracies), you can mod in 2016 season, you can mod in harder racing AI, you can mod in slightly better visuals, you can mod in super season that combines all the tracks from previous games that weren't available in newer games. You name it - what was made for older F1 Codemasters games, you can mod it into this game to get ultimate V6 hybrid era experience.And if you ask me, season with Istanbul park, Imola, Jérez and many other circuits added to the classic mix of current F1 circuits is alot of fun. And yes, you can also make cars way more grippier and faster. It takes some will and fine tuning to find what exactly suits your style, but once you do that, this game is pretty much the best sim/arcade F1 experience you can get if we don't count F1 2016.Vanilla F1 2014 is like 7/10. Modded F1 2014 to your liking is solid 8.5/10. Just don't buy it for multiplayer, it's pretty much dead as everybody already moved onto newer games..."

My computer is quite old, which prevented me from getting a newer game, but I don't feel that I really needed a newer one (other than driver and team changes).The AI tends to avoid wheel to wheel racing, backing out of corners if you're side by side - so you can bully faster cars to keep your position.  I'd prefer them to be a bit more aggressive, but this seems to be pretty typical of AI in racing games.Well worth my time and money"

It is similar, but Codemasters have added quite a few different tweaks to spice up the F1 experience. Apparently, a lot of people didn't like the 2015 edition so this is why I went for the 2014 one. Overall, I am extremely pleased with my purchase, especially as I snatched up this game while it was on offer. There has most certainly been an improvement in the graphics in comparison to the 2013 game, which is more noticeable on the street circuits, where the graphics are the most demanding on your system. All of the teams and drivers and circuits have been fully updated to match the 2014 season. I like the new Sochi track in Russia which offers quite a challenging driving experience. Also, it's cool that they brought back the old track in Austria. The F1 Classics is not included in the 2014 game, but I didn't really use it much anyway, so it's not a big loss. If you liked the Classics last year, then I would probably suggest sticking with the 2013 edition. So overall, I recommend this game to anyone who is up for an challenge in the world of F1 racing."

Bugs that where in 2013 are in this game and there are a couple AI issues too. you can get around all this with mods or just playing the game around the bugs.People complain about lack of grip/downforce etc. But you have to realise that the  game is replicating real Formula 1 so if F1 rules state less downforce then the game is going to have to do that too. another complaint i hear is the sound of the cars. That is not codemaster's fault so you cant blame them.The career length can be adjusted to suit you as well as the race weekend length which is a nice touchOverall the game is ""ok"" at best and online play is not much to be desired.

You'll now take the tyres you set your fastest lap in Q2 into the race so you can go balls-out (if you make it) in Q3 for pole with a set of the softs.The sounds in general seem pretty good. The engines of the three maufacturers are represented and could be recognised from the onboard footage I watch week in week out on the BBC, Sky,F1.com, YouTube etc.In terms of gameplay it appears fairly accurate. The Mercedes disappear up the road and the WIlliams, Red Bulls, Ferraris and to a lesser extent, the McLarens, scrap over the other podium spout and the top 10 order.The total lack of control of ERS is a significant negative for this game though. In a year where the charging and discharging of the non-combustion engine has become an even more pivotal role Codemasters decides to bottle it and take that away from the driver.The ""classic"" content from F1 2013 was a huge plus and one I revelled in personally. To not only not improve on but to remove it from the franchise was a bit of a kick in the teeth. The Scenarios and Season Challenges are welcome continues but it feels somewhat lacking. These new generation turbo cars would be complemented by some 1980s turbo kit.Multiplayer-wise, to date, I've really struggled with this game personally. I've probably spent more time in lobbies than I have racing. Can't think of a game version I've not tried and a lot of games have just ended up being full of kids with keyboards; no interest in a race. Just a destruction derby a lot of the time. I have no time for people who don't leave you room and would rather turn into an accident, lock wheels, than turn away and maintain momentum.Right now I don't think I'd recommend it as you can be charged a bit of a silly price for it. With it not being next-gen and most of my friends eing on Xbox One or PS4 I've not had to shell out for a console version as well this year.Do I recommend this game?

I have completed about a season and a half on career. It seems to be much more enjoyable if you start with a lower team (I actually started with Marussia) and worked my way up (currently racing for Torro Roso.), which presents the greatest challenge. You won't win all the races or blow the competition out of the water...as a matter of fact, you will most likely be lapped and left in the dust.

The career isn't quite as immerisive as it was way back in the early games but it is still a lot of fun....and present unlike in 2015.I have been racing a Coop season with a friend and I must say, it has gone pretty seemlessly. Any online racing I have done on 2015 has been laggy and half the time cars just ghost and the race becomes a time trial which is boring.If you want a techincal racing game that is going to take some time to really become proficient at....this is your game. If you don't like a bit of a challenge, then you will probably be frustrated by this game, but overall this game I would give an 8/10."

So I do watch the F1 series on television. The game to start with is not newbie friendly more like anti newbie friendly. The game gives you next to no information about how to change the wings on your F1 car. It gives you no information about the DRS system and how to use it. It does give you an evaluation test that in my opinion is useless that is supposed to set the difficulty automatically for you. Mine was very easy I later did a custom job as I couldnt stand a lot of the hand holding. Just one other point I should point out the AI has no tire wear in bad weather. They do pit but its a script. So in bad weather good luck to you.I know so far it sounds like I hated this game. Not so. I do enjoy the tracks, the graphics and sounds of the racing. Its great. In clear weather racing its fun and interesting. They have a ton of different teams you can join and the best part is the game its modable. Their is even an alpha to update the game to 2015 colors for cars and tracks. Great stuff.  Mods are atRacedepartment.comAs I have mentioned before the game can be tailored to your liking. Make it  easy or maybe a mix of very easy and easy. Your choice. If you have all the assists to max its very doubtful your going to go flying off the track. The AI is a mixture of good and bad. Your rival who you can pick will end up being a great driver by the end of the season. He might start of terrible but as you soon as you pick him. Surprise he is suddenly a great driver. This is annoying.You do have a partner and unlike Grid Autosport he is actually able to be in the top 10 usually. I do think however that had Grid autosport allowed Open-Wheel cars to pit that it would have a sizeable advantage over this game. The game is fun however its also very annoying as well. Due to the AI not having tires degrade in bad weather puts the human player at a big disadvantage. I should add I played this with a xbox360 controller. I do recommend this game only if its on sale. I payed $11 dollars for it and feel like I have already gotten my moneys worth out of the game. So their you have it. I would rate this game an 8/10 right now just based on my play time with it. Also I should mention that I did win the first seasonal championship in the game.I would like to add one more item. This game is not a true to life simulator. I would call it sim lite. My main issue with the game is the way the players car turns. Turn off the assists and it turns like a school bus. Also the back end gives out a lot more then it should. I have never driven a f1 in my entire life but watching them on television only. The handling feels off somehow. I honestly feel like Grid autosport is more true to life as far as open wheel handeling and what you would think the cars would drive like. Sticky tires and able to turn hard into a corner without the back end shooting out  all over the place."

Since Yes and No are the two options, however, I'll give it a Yes.With the livery of every single car, the engine sounds, gears and everything else changed to match the 2014 season, I expected great things from this game. However... after I bought it (on sale, mind you), I remembered how quickly I got bored of F1 2013, and that game had many more features such as the Classic cars and tracks. I started to think I had made a massive mistake.Once I got into the game, though, I felt like it wasn't all that bad. The cars were nice to drive and the new tracks were very well done. I did face the same problem I did in 2013 and that was the Intermediate difficulty was too easy for me and the Expert difficulty was just too hard, but that's probably just me.Overall I would recommend this game, but I'd advise you only buy it if it's on sale.

The guy standing at the front of the car is pushing last years model and his hands are more than a foot away from the new cars and is very offputting, immediately detracting from any realism you were hoping to feel.AI is just as dumb when it comes to moving off the racing line and will smash into you rather than avoid you if you are going slower on an out lap.The rules can be totally ignored by the AI drivers which is especially evident when there's a safety car out. For example, I'm leading the race and lined up behind the safety car, just going into the final bend where the SC is about to go into the pits, nowhere near the finish/start line. The car in second place speeds past me and I get disqualified for overtaking with a safety car out.So basically it's still plagued by the many bugs/flaws of its predessors and has to rank among the laziest 'updates' I've ever played, yet still I enjoy the game.

I think it was the new additions like new tracks, supersoft tires, new engines, and ERS implementations that made me enjoy it a lot more then the other installations. So to all those ""OH ITS JUST A 2013 RESKIN"", stop complaining, and look on the bright side more! :D Face it,  you play a game that updates every year, so nothing extremely grand can happen. For all the changes in the 2014 season I think codemasters did a great job, and I give the game about a 8.5/10. Could be a few improvements, but still a great game. I love the new cars and the new tracks like Sochi, and hope next year is just as great. I defiantly reccomend to anyone new to F1 games, as well as anyone coming from F1 2013. And especially to people coming from F1 2012 and below. Thanks for reading! Pros and cons below.Pros:- No more tutorial thing to annoy you and just a one lap around monza to determine difficulty, which was VERY helpful.- AI to me seems at LEAST a bit more difficult than 2012 and 2013.- Up to date cars, tracks, and rules for the 2014 season. (ERS, Super soft tires, new engines, etc. They were also implemented VERY well in my opinion).- The ferrari looks cool as ♥♥♥♥- Minor track improvements here and there, nothing really major but little touch up that I enjoyed.- More details added around the tracks and cars to add realisim which i quite enjoy- More enjoyable handling IMO than in F1 2012.- I slightly bumped a curb at Hungaroring and my car flipped twice. I found it quite hilarious and just used a flashback, so I didn't really find it as a con :PCons:- Engines don't sound as cool on all of the cars.- Without assists I found the car slid a lot and was more difficult than F1 2013 or 2012 without assists.- No more classics expansion packs- The mercades are REALLY f*cking fast. On legend AI, if you let them the slightest lead, you will NOT catch them, they just streak ahead.- ERS is confusing for a newcomer- THE MERCADES ARE REALLY F*CKING OP AND FAST- It costs 49.99 USD**(this may or may have not been my first serious review so if somehow you do read this, dont bash me in the comments pls ty)**"

It's disappointing to say it once more, but it's fact. This 2014 game is a step forward in on track driving but still lacking in immersion off track.The game is enjoyable on the whole and the price drop is welcome since there is alot of copy paste going on.The ontrack handling is very enjoyable requiring skill but the cars are more realistic and manageable, the brakes on the other hand seem to have been dumbed down in difficulty. You can really push the brakes now and there is a nice little audible that give you a hint in advance of any lockup. It seems to work well for gameplay.The lack of traction in general has made racing the cars on the limit a hell of a lot of fun and very satisfying in getting those perfect laps, or if you over cook it a little and go into a drift.The rules changed and removed KERS making overtaking a little trickier, but that in turn made successful overtaking more satifying.The AI is still not very bright; at overtaking and can easily be lead into trying it around the outside, where it has to slot back in behind. Also sometimes it get offline and seem to just give up trying to take the corner and lets numerous cars go by before it slots back into the train.There's no 3D modelled interactive agent, no paddock or motor homes. No interaction with the media and no press interviews for podiums. All hurting the game series since losing it in 2012. The animations are all old, even the HUD graphics are 99% from F1 2013.I'd recommend it just on the racing, but without the immersion it falls down to it's older brother, F1 2011.Don't get me wrong it's a step in the right direction, but I wouldn't endorse it as is to friends when F1 2011 exists.F1 2011 might be outdated, but it holds all the longevity gameplay items the newer F1 games by codemasters can only dream about,"

76561198008259791,Recommended,226580,14445787,"Posted: 13 February, 2015",all,best-raven,"This game is the third consecutive F1 instalment I played and third that’s probably going to get more than 100 hrs of my attention. Even though people bash this game for basically everything from graphics to content-related mistakes to less fun from the gameplay, I found it just as enjoyable as 2012 and 2013.Why do I like it?Basically it’s a new formula. New teams, new cars, new steering wheels, new rules. I was actually shocked by how much the car handling has changed. When I stopped playing 2013 game I was ruling the grid in a Lotus (4th best team of the season) with legendary AI setting and all assists off. I got into 2014 Ferrari using the same difficulty settings and in the first race qualified… 18th. The game is still demanding (maybe even more), some new aspects of driving were tweaked (in this one you can see and feel tyres cooling down on long straights, which creates a new set of challenges). And even though Mercedes are quite dominant in the game it is possible to win driving a different car, and some race events (like mid-race rainfall) can shuffle the grid in a way which creates way more interesting result than in real F1 timetables. The game surely isn’t flawless, but its strong roots still make it a solid product.Why some people have a point bashing this game?Yes, the new cars don’t have KERS, so there is no “boost” button to press when you feel you’re not fast enough. Presence of the 8th gear isn’t much of addition in terms of gameplay. Yes, Williams definitely has the wrong steering wheel. And yes, some tracks are unchanged, even though some of them were in reality altered for 2014 season. This last one isn’t entirely true. Canadian GP has a modified asphalt run-off area which was covered with grass in 2013, and some new buildings appeared in Monaco (most notably on the left of the famous tunnel exit). Plus two completely new tracks appeared on the calendar. The fact that some tracks were updated, while others were just pasted form the previous game makes me feel that development of the game was cut short at some stage.I still love the graphics, but what I have a problem with is that the cars somehow got ugly on the details. And I don’t mean generally uglier car designs. In 2013 I loved the front wing camera in the replays, in 2014 it just shows how underdeveloped the car model is in terms of detail. Just closely watch the nose and floor of Ferrari F14T – you’ll notice some very crude edges and weird shapes.Some people say that this game is just a 2013 mod featuring new cars. Sadly I have to agree. The full price is regrettable. Probably marketing strategy is meant make money of the newcomers. A person who had the previous game and buys this one for a full price may get furious.Do I recommend it?Let’s say a conditional “YES”. I marked “recommend” for this review because I have positive feelings about the game. But it clearly does not deserve thumbs up and “hell yeah”. You should definitely buy this game IF you are an F1 fan who wants to experience how formula changed in 2014, or if you like race simulations and haven’t tried F1 yet. And most definitely if you find this game on sale. The 2015 game will hopefully be better and all “next-gen”, but so far this is the only one with turbo engine F1 cars.PS: Fromula 1 fan ranting (you can stop reading, unless you are an F1 fan too, or a 2015 developer :)I found that the game was dumbed down a bit in terms of campaign interface, first race and team choosing. It’s nice that you can now select “length” of the season (number of featured races), but if they add an option of shortening a season I’d like to manually discard some of the races from the calendar. Some people liked replacing testing day with a simple racing sequence to evaluate player’s skills, like in GRID series. But I’m afraid it doesn’t work too well. When I tried it I found that it was around 1 lap of the simplest track (Monza) and all the assists were by default on. I almost crashed on the first corner when I started fighting with AUTOMATIC gearbox in an F1 car. Nice for newcomers, but will irritate the hell of the gamers who actually know what they’re doing. Also now you get to choose ANY team at the start of your career. A rookie in Mercedes AMG? Why the hell not. It actually doesn’t bother me since everybody can immediately choose their favourite team, and not struggle with Marussia or Caterham (yuck) for at least half of the season. What bothers me is that the team’s performance is defined at the starting point. Generally the developers decided that the big three is Mercedes, Red Bull, and Ferrari. This hurts Williams which had a terrific 2014 season and their performance in the game is way lower than it should be."

Uses the same outdated game engine of 2013 just with a different paint coat. Even the devs admited this years version was a reskin push out that they spent little time or effort on to focus on the new next gen game engine that '15 and '16 use. Also lacks the force feedback and wheel weight for newer wheels (g29 / ts300 ect) just like 2013 does.All in all, at this point 2014 is a pointless title that doesn't substancially improve on 2013 and is inferiour to 2015+ (ESP '16) in every single aspect from graphics to espcially car simulation, handling, braking, AI, tire ware, fuel consumption, weight transfer, ect ect. If you have a newer wheel like g29 / ts300 that work with the next gen consoles then you can forget F1 titles prior to 2015 (the first next gen only f1 title) as the force feedback doesn't work with the last gen games ('14 and eariler).Now that 2016 is out it puts this and all previous titles to shame in every way, but especially this one as '14 is by far the worst of them.

Most mods for this game can be used or there is a very simialr one for f1 2013 but f1 2013 is a much more enjoyable game to play. And if you would rather a v6 era f1 game for cheap f1 2015 is more grpahically enyhanced. However with alot of modfs you can make this looks if anything better then f1 2015. You cna also make it completely yours. So if you want a game from teh new era of F1 (I have no clue have anyone would) and you want to make it completely yours I would 100% reccomend it!

Sure I could buy a larger batch to last a little longer but feta clean out of the brine is the way to do it. it taste better, smells better, and is still so moist.Feta is great in salads, on pizza, melted into veggie dishes and can be stuffed into everything from peaches to peppers. But what about just eating it on its own, sure I’ll go to the fridge and nibble on the block but never do I sit down with a fork and knife and go at it. I have to admit its is a very overwhelming cheese, the salt alone would make me want to get up and walk away. But what goes better with salty than sweet, nothing… So here is how you can sit down with a block of feta eat it all and still want more for years to come. The first time I ever tried honey baked feta was in 2009, it is 2012 and Im still thinking about it.

It's absolutely ridiculous.The AI - Far worse an effort than last year, the AI feel like they are driving completely different cars to me, at some parts they brake way later than I can, at others, they have so much more grip they must have made their cars from magnets and put iron in the roads. They catapult themselves between far too aggressive and far too meek, almost bi-polar even.In 3 months there will be several high quality AI mods and this complaint will be rendered null, but I shouldn't have to wait until a modder, on his own time makes a mockery of codemasters.The performance - My graphics card is overheating on high settings.Well obviously you say, get a better graphics card! Well, yeah, that too. But I've been playing the older games on the very highest settings, including using graphics enhancing mods and they look ab-so-lute-ly gorgeous.

No, I absolutely can't, not only that, but they are significantly worse, the reflections are blocky and the colouration is distorted, the mirrors remind me of my N64 (yes, I exaggerate, but not by nearly enough) (already there are fixes on the steam forum for this, if users can fix it within a few days, why wasn't it like it in the first place?). It's just plain worse. And given that it's pretty much the same game as last year, I shouldn't have that problem.Content - Well, we all knew that this was going to be a stop gap until F1 2015. But that doesn't make it better. This feels very slim compared to the earlier titles.It just frustrates me that these are issues, as sure as the Sun sets there are many other issues, but these strike me in particular as things that are easy to fix, should never have been an issue in the first place or just smack or finances being the goal and not the game.Having said that, it's not all bad.

I\'m not fully blaming Codemaster for this bug/glitch, I started to suspect Windows 10 that might cause this problem. Overall the game looks pretty cool, I thank the person who made the graphics look so realistic also the detail in the car, crowd, grass, circuit, etc. Sadly I can\'t give a good review about the game until either Microsoft or Codemaster fix this tiny problem. Remember that many people put a lot of effort into this game!

While the handling is quite different and does reflect some of the changes in the 2014 season you could just be driving the old V8s as the developers haven't bothered to implement the more refined features of the 2014 engines. In fact, there are fewer engine features in this game than in the previous games. Now you've just got the loud pedal, the stop pedal and DRS. There's no implementation of boost or energy recovery, something that seems to be a key factor for the real cars. Whether the developers didn't have access to this sort of information, thought it would be too complex for the average gamer or were just too lazy to put it into the game it does mean that if you're thinking of upgrading to the latest version to get the features of the 2014 spec engines then you're going to be disappointed. If you're happy to carry on with the V8s and an earlier driver line up then hang onto your cash and wait for the new technologies to be properly developed."

,Not Recommended,226580,12521372,"Posted: 17 October, 2014",all,chrizb,"Having had a comparision to a long history of F1 Games from early atari via the penical of Geoff Crammond's masterpieces and lows like Alain Prost's racing all the way through to the current crop you can assume two things. I love driving games, especially simulations, and I am a bit of a mug, as I buy (almost) all of them. Seeing the progression of Codemaster efforts I can't help but shake the feeling that they are fallowing the market, no doubt backed up by the in game logging system that shows them statistical distributions of which features are used how often and so on. I am not sure that works for me.In short: This game is great for casual to intermediate racers, but the simplification of the game has taken a lot of the simulation feel away. Please buy it if this is your first go, or if you prefer your racing fast, furious and not too serious/dull. It is definitly great fun and even a bit of a simulation. Having said that, don't be a mug and buy it if you own 2013. Just don't!Long version:On the positive side I think F1 2014 is making a good stab at recreating the new feel of F1. Squeeling tyres, odd engine noises and the changed breaking distances are all reflected. In addition the racing is very emersive and overall the game gives you a good race in most scenarios. For example I expected the new track in Russia to be boring as F1 drivers stated that the simulator didn't represent the real fun of the track, as it flowed much nicer in reality. However when I started timed laps around it I got into a rythm pretty quickly and before long really enjoyed the track, which can only mean one thing: Nice job Coders :)When starting the game you get a nice intro (very much like 2013) and all the visuals are at the same level as 2013 with the odd tweek here and there. For example sparks flying from underneath the car are noticable and sometimes really get into your virtual face. The handling is also improved somewhat with a sharper feel, reflecting the oversteer nature of modern F1 cars. Scenario modes are there as before, increasing in difficulty, but if you have played them in 2013, then 2014 doesn't offer anything new. But scenarios are in general good fun. I found the rain / wet track scenario quite hard but that might just be me. Compared to other online racers, who post rediculously high scores, I seem to be middle of the pack.In a season challange you again get the chance to pick an opponent from anywhere on the grid and as long as you beat them best of 3, then you get their seat. Starting this challange on medium I was surprised to be dumped straight into qualifying on a new track in Austria (although I had vague memories of the layout from F1GP2). Steep learning curve? You bet. Especially for novice drivers.  But great fun.There are some differences that are fairly neutral. No boost button anymore, No gear rations to set and a couple of other minor changes not worth mentioning here. Suffices to say the format of F1 has changed in reality and this game reflects this. But it does lead to less to do and think about. Given that there is little new besides the sound and some drive models I can't shake the feeling that it is too little change for the better. One thing worth mentioning is that if you opt to return to the pits the 2013 version had a nasty habbit of continuing the engine noise. That has been fixed. On the otherhand desperatly trying to switch to a one stop strategy at Imola was impossible, even when calling for option tyres from the car. The pit crew just ignored me forcing me to stop again :(Pit stops, corner cutting penalties and so on have all be retained although the execution has ever so slightly changed (you can switch this penalty off as well ). And this is where my list of gripes start. This should not be taken too seriously but I was hopping since 2011 that this would be fixed and it still hasn't happened:I am missing:1) freedom to set up the car asymetrically (different settings for every corner of the car)2) What about dampers, gearration at the beginning of the season and so on?3) The black and white nature of the commentary and news articles (I raced from last to 8th in a caterham on high difficulty level, one place behind my rival (Vettel) and ended up with an animation of my driver shaking his head in dispair - that does kill the mood4) Why not let us drive the pre-race lap to check out the track?5) cartoon physics and damage model - I am sick and tired of getting nothing but wing damage. Please sort it and negotiate harder with the FIA. This is probably one of my major gripes, especially since it now includes mid air drifting when jumping shikanes (you can try this on most 90 degree corners). It is also still true that in a pile up cars have a tendency to ""stick together"" because the collision detection still does not resolve object interlocking correctly (In the real world two objects hitting each other end up repelling each other, but not here). This has been a basic 3D Vector coding problem since the 1990s, and while some games have managed to solve this, codemasters is alas still stuck in the past (although it is not ruining the game!).6) The AI still has major flaws around lapping (slowing on the racing line most of the times when met in corners) and their tendency to drive into you from behind at the start of races is also somewhat annoying (of course with no penalty).7)  Can we have a story line please? You sort of had a half hearted story in an earlier version but killed it.8) Please give us better grafics than the playstation. We can handle it.9) I would like testing (could also be the tsrat of the story line) - especially pre-season to help with developing the car in a direction I like.10) accuracy of the penalty system is still poor. Sorry, but if 2 wheel are still on the road (U-Turn in Canada) even if the other two are not, then there should be no penalty - just as an example.11) Career progression is unrealistic. If you drive the socks of a Caterham and continously put it in the top 10 over 5 races in the season you will be offered a contract by one of the top 3 teams. But not in this game.12) What about two way communications around pit stops? Please fix that and enhance so that when tyre wear is low the pit might ask how it is going? How about having multiple race stratregies amd an option to switch to plan C?Therew are many more wishes, but the above could all have been done with a little bit more work and they are not ground breaking either. All in all this is a genuine attempt at getting something new represented in the F1 world, but the price does not reflect the changes made, which are overall minor tweeks. Not all of them to my liking. Simply put, by going after a broader appeal Simulation fans have ended up loosing out again. That is frustrating to say the least. It feels shallower and the physics execution is more like TOCA then F1. I still can't feel the build up of downforce as the speed increasese, and I can't gain a tenth here and there by doing very carful car set-ups.I know that is not what thew majority seems to want, but then this is my review and they can write theirs.Dear Codmasters:Please rework the phsyics from scratch (car, damage, collision, the lot).Please give us more simulation options that make real differences on how the car feels, andbring us a propper career story line.Yours faithfullyChris (F1 simulation addict)"

F1 2014 takes it to a whole new level of excellence and graphical mastery. Yes, the classic content is missing, compared to the previous version, but everything about this game is so outstanding and so enjoyable that you end up accepting it for what it is enthusiastically. In fact, I have never had so much fun with any of the F1 games previously released. It is as accessible or challenging as you want it to be. I personally like the evaluation test drive that automatically determines the level of difficulty that is most suitable, given your skill level. It works extremely well. In short, F1 2014 is a must buy."

Sure it is basically a reskin for f1 2013 graphics wise but there are some things I really like about the game. I have 2 mods running on it which makes the damage more realistic and the AI more realistic. It makes it a good challenge to beat someone like Lewis even on lesser difficulties. I feel like this game is closer to F1 2012 handling wise. In F1 2013 I slide around a lot and had trouble finding grip anywhere but like in F1 2012 Its just a better game. The one downside is in career mode you can start with any team you want and not just a few low teams. If you do buy this game please add a few mods and have fun. Online is great too if your servers are connected to the UK.

The handling model is different enough from last year that it takes quite a bit of getting used to, and on the highest difficulty the game gives you a good challange. If you do a few laps in practice, and then do qualifying and the race you get quite a lot of value from the game, even on the shortest time settings.There are a few issues with the game that bug me though.First lap AI performance is terrible. Even on the highest diffuculty you can easily make up five to ten places on the first few corners, after which point the cars are spread out enough that it becomes a bit more realistic.Mirrors look awful. Not only are they really low quality but they are not even accurate! At one point I was being chased by Rosberg but it was Hamilton's #44 that showed in the mirror.The menus are slightly improved from last years game (it is now a bit more obvious which option is selected) but are still not really up to scratch.AI is not very good at recovering if you use the rewind feature. If an AI car is at a certain point in a corner when you resume it will often overshoot and go off track or hit the barrier.I wish that liveries were a bit more accurate, the lack of alcohol sponsorship in this game makes the Maclaren and Williams look really bare.Despite these issues I really do enjoy this game, even if it is just more of last years game in many ways."

Graphics and the menus are completely unchanged. I assume, changes in this area will come with the next gen version Codemaster is working on. If one expects any news in this field, dont buy this game. But ...The driving has changed significantly and I believe for the better. From all I have heard from drivers comments and TV footage this years F1 cars are more powerfull and have much more torque, than the 2013 cars. Although I never had the privilege to actually have driven a Formula 1 car in reality this programm gives me the feeling of how it could be. One need to be careful with the throttle, but the acceleration is really fast if you get it right. Looking on the replays of my first trials the driving very much looked like what I saw on TV. The F1 2013 version was really difficult to drive, but I never had the feeling that it was actually real driving. With the new version now I can really fight with the car and the opponents.If you are a F1 fan you want to have the actual cars and drivers of 2014 anyway. If you love racing on computer, this game is cedrtainly a lot of fun, much more than the previous versions.  I have already deinstalled F1 2013 from my SDD to save capacity as I certainly will not use it beside the 2014 version. Although the price is slightly too high I strongly recommend buying the game, if you are a true Formula One enthusiast."
76561197965004501,Recommended,226580,12598445,"Posted: 21 October, 2014",all,cloister56,"Do I recommend? Well in this games case I would but with qualifications.F1 2014 is effectively an update to the 2013 game. The teams, drivers, tracks and rules are all updated to the 2014 season with the cars driving very differently from the 2013 versions. However I suspect given the earlier planned release of the 2015 edition (so we don't get the game with 3 races to go), that many features have been left out or just not complete.There are clues throughout like the new bigger display steering wheels which are in fact copied and pasted between several teams.The scenario mode, far from being improved from last year is truncated with no option to try the same scenario on a different difficulty.The liveries on the cars are in some cases (McLaren) distant cousins of the real thing which will annoy anyone wanting accuracy. The graphics are an incremental increase nothing more.The additional sting is what was removed, the classics last years seemed like a great beginning something that would be developed as the series continued but they are ripped completely from the franchise.Personally I'm hoping this represents Codemasters shedding the limitations of the previous cycle to do something really special, with this release being a contractual obligation. I guess we will find out in 2015.In the end can I recommend this? Well if, if you love F1 and want to recreate this season then yes. If you are just looking for some kind of F1 game, want value for money or have love for the days of Schumacher, Hill and Mansell then await the sale (or buy elsewhere) and get F1 2013.If you already own F1 2013, well I hope my review has helped you decide."

Blocking brakes seems harder, what makes driving (without assists) easier in that aspect, I am not sure if it is realistic or not, but overall driving is superb.

But I won't recommend it because there are better F1 games available to play like 2013 and 2016.However it will be a positive review because I am now getting used to it unlike 2015 :PLet's start this review of F1 2014.I won't split into positives and negatives because I can't think of many things. Some features though include:Career. It's ok, not the most realistic but it's really cool and has better features than F1 2013, with the choice of multiple season lengths which you get achievements for completing or winning in. If you're not much of a career player, go for the 7 race season. If you're a casual career player, go for the 12 race season. If you really like career, go for the full season and enjoy the experience :) I like it.AI. They're fine imo, they are good to race with, but unfortunately they are really slow and scared to make moves on you. They are very cautious which makes races unenjoyable and not fun :( Compared to F1 2015 and 2016 they aren't good.Handling. It can be good at times, but on a pad it's actual crap. It understeers a lot and I'm really slow at the game. 1:17 at Monaco for memory. Ridiculous. This game doesn't suit me much compared to 2013 or 2016. Not as bad as 2015 though.UPDATE: I am getting faster at this game and enjoying the handling now. I beat my Mercedes lap at Abu Dhabi in a Toro Rosso in Racenet Challenge which is just unbelievable.Pad and wheel comparison. Now this is an interesting one, because the pad is faster as it has a built in traction control, so even if you turn it off, it's like a built in assist. Meanwhile on the wheel you can oversteer without TC and of course, better turn in. I don't really like it like that.Funny gear sounds. When you shift down really fast into a wrong gear for a corner it makes the funniest rev sound like the engine is about to blow up XD. It's hilarious. I enjoy doing that, my friend did that on a video where he killed his engine so I tried it too :PNo changes compared to 2013. There are absolutely no changes in 2014 compared to 13 tbh, the only differences are that the car sounds are different, handling is way worse and the game music is different. Also career is too. It's only because they were trying to work on F1 2015 which wasn't a success either.Overall F1 2014 is a decent game. But it has very little features which are different to 2013. I enjoy the game once I play it after a while. Handling demotivates me a bit but I can deal with it unlike 2015 ;)Hope you enjoyed reading, have a nice day."
