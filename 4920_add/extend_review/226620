Around noon on Friday they sat me down in front of a PC and had me try the game - apparently I did well (I looked at the goblin before attacking it and noticed it had first strike). After a merry but short romp through the introduction dungeon, which ended with a green blob of slime eating my poor adventurer, I went on to explore the rest of the Indie Megabooth. Friday night though, before I went to sleep, I knew there was a bit of unfinished business: I bought the game, and not just because the developers are great guys (but that too).The game delivers what it promisses: bite sized adventures you can play during a break. The other day I had 15 minutes to spare: 10 of those were used by a berserker clearing a swamp of monsters.It may look like a simple game, but it has a suprising amound of depth, with many abilities, items and other things that lead to multiple ways to tackle dungeons and may have you adapting your strategy based on what you encounter.And there is a lot to encounter. Just when you think you have seen all the races, seen all the classes, you find one more. Then you check the journal and see just how much you haven't seen yet (I found it more fun not to check how much I am missing so as not to spoil the pleasure of finding something new).But how do you play? Simple: you select a dungeon to explore and write an adventuring permit. The permit is the ""character creation"" process of that dungeon. For example it could say: To [dungeon name], For Generic Adventuring, Race: Human, Class: Warrior, Equipment: starting adventurer's kit. Then you would play the dungeon with a simple lvl 1 human warrior.As the game progresses you unlock more races, classes and can provide better starting equipment and other bonuses, making each run unique.So what are you waiting for? Your kingdom needs you! Oh, you need a permit? To: Unnamed Desktop Dungeon Kingdom, For: Kingdom Administration, Race: Human, Class: Gamer. There you go, your permit to play the game.And yes, the alpha version is available for free to try out :)"

There's almost no luck and a surprising amount of planning involved. Each dungeon is like a puzzle, and might take 15-45 minutes to complete. You start each dungeon as a lowly level 1 character. Kill the monsters in a certian order and gain the power-ups at the right times and you will be able to defeat the boss-monster and thus ""win"" each dungeon.  if you randomly charge in like a hack-and-slash game, you won't maximize your powerups and you won't have enough health to tackle the tougher monsters. Same if you spend the power-ups too soon. If you don't defeat the tougher monsters, you don't gain the experience-point bonuses to increase your abilities enough to tackle the boss-monster. As you complete dungeons, you can unlock other character classes (again, you start each dungeon back as level 1).The art and story in a tongue-in-cheek way poke fun at the Fantasy Role Playing genre. The price is cheap and the play value is good."

,Not Recommended,226620,7797579,"Posted: 27 November, 2013",all,huffadopolis,"I guess I was expecting more RPG and less Strategy because this game seemed to me to be too difficult to be fun.It starts out easy, you have to clear single-screen 'dungeons' that are tough but defeatable.  By the time I had finished the tutorials (and even some of those I had to cheat and look for solutions on youtube) that was the end of any successful dungeon clearing that I was able to do.Game in a nutshell is: The playfield is dark except where your character begins.  You always begin at level 1 but can choose your race/class and optionally pay some ingame gold for starting equipment (example: a shield that reduces all damage by 2).  You are placed on the screen and have to move around uncovering the darkened squares and ultimately defeat the level 10 boss of the dungeon.   Sounds fun right?The only way to heal yourself and your mana (used for skills found as you explore the dungeon) are potions or uncovering darkened dungeon squares.  Both are in limited supply.The 'casual' rating of this game is true in the time required to play sense, but if you don't exploit every single weakness of every enemy, and if you don't kill higher level enemies for the bonus exp (which is harder than it sounds, again, very limited healing) you have no chance of killing the level 10 boss monster.Because every move counted so much, and because ultimately it takes a lot of moves to clear a dungeon, I found myself getting frustrated at how incapable I found myself of clearing a dungeon.  I'd get to level 8 or 9 and simply not be able to kill enough enemies at that point without dying, to get to level 10 or have enough of a stockpile of potions for the final boss of each dungeon.So, instead of surely dying to the higher level boss, I would exit the dungeon, able to keep whatever gold I found in there and selling off the potions for 50-60 gold, take away 10-15 it costs for the items you bring with you.  At that point I was looking at minimum 500 gold upgrades to unlock anything more fun about the game, and I decided to uninstall and give up on the game because there was no other difficulty setting.If that kinda game sounds fun more power to you but I was looking for a much more casual game, as in not an intense experience.  I wanted to shut my brain off for a bit but this took all of my concentration and was, for me, not a fun game to play in hindsight."

I understand.Desktop Dungeons is a somewhat randomized puzzle game cleverly disguised as a roguelite rpg.  It's also incredibly brutal.  That aside (or possibly because of it), I found the game enjoyable in that ""bring out your inner masochistic rage junkie"" kinda way.  A single mistake can cost you the level, & sometimes you don't find out until 10 minutes later.  One time my mouse was on the fritz & occassionally registered two clicks from one press.  It rendered this game unplayable.  However, overall it was a positive entertainment experience, in that I preferred it over staring at a wall.So why is this review in the ""not recommended"" section?  I don't find the quality of entertainment worth the price tag.  There are plenty of other games out there that can offer a similar playstyle, are more immersive, have greater replayability, & cost a fraction of what I paid for Desktop Dungeons.  While this is a decently good game, it's not $15-good.  Its inflated cost is also reflected in its soundtrack- an arbitrary $10 for something that many games include for free.  Wait for a sale, preferably at least 30% off, hopefully more."

That being said Steam asks if I would recommend this game to people, my answer is yes but not to everyone. See the game has plenty of replay value as evidenced by a whole bunch of other reviewers putting in much more time than I did. However if you're like me and enjoy more traditional rpgs then this game isn't for you. The graphics are standard roguelike graphics with chracter pieces not sprites added in. The music is very catchy and fun. This game can be like an extremely quick and complex version of D&D or an even more complex and long game similar to D&D. This game is well made while being easy on the surface it takes a bit to master it. If I were basing this review off of my experience alone I'd give it a 6/10 just because it isn't my kind of game. However seeing the game from a reviewers standpoint and looking at how the athstetics and gameplay contribute to the game as a whole I give it an 8.75/10 it's the type of game that demands patience and persistance. If you have the time invest into this baby, lord knows she desereves it...

From the screens and videos I wasn't sure this was a game I'd like, but I'm glad I tried it.The difficulty is like FTL's, you get pummeled and you just want to keep trying until you succeed. There's quite a bit of diversity in the game with a ton of race-class options. Beyond the varying difficulty dungeon runs, there are additional challenges and quests. To top it all off, you get to build a little city for succeeding in your adventures, opening up even more options.Dungeons seem to take 10-30 minutes to run, so you can play for short periods of time or long."

Desktop Dungeons is about as close to a real roguelike as you're going to get on Steam, and doing a damn fine job at it. Procedural map generation, turn-based combat, tile grids and permadeath are all present. Punishingly difficult, but really rewarding as well. Makes hours just fly by."
,Recommended,226620,15754727,"Posted: 9 May, 2015",all,Tom,"Desktop Dungeons is a turn based roguelike with a little bit of a difference; each run in a dungeon takes about five minutes to come to conclusion. You are free to roam around the dungeon as much as you want, enemies will only attack you if you attack them first, giving you the freedom to work out your strategy however you prefer.Graphics are the usual 2d style which we are seeing so much of these days, but the sprites are nicely designed with some well-known characters thrown in there such as Super Meat Boy. The UI can be a little daunting to begin with but you see all of the information you require within one click.Each of the individual levels are randomly generated; this adds to the replayability of the game as no dungeon will ever be the same; I believe each dungeon has its own set ""theme"" but what is included in the dungeon and how its laid out is completely random. The difficulty is something to be said for though, it is very easy to learn how to play, but very difficult to master, you will die, ALOT in Desktop Dungeons, they even tell you that at the very beginning of the game; it is to be expected. It takes a lot of thought out planning and preparation to work your way through most of the dungeons even straight after the tutorial you are thrown straight in at the deep end.The game length can vary, I have been playing for about five hours and I still haven’t managed to get past the fifth dungeon, there are tons of content available, class challenges, random dungeon runs, extra tutorial lessons for different spells and many more. I have seen some people with over a hundred hours put into Desktop Dungeon. One of the extra plus points I've found is that a potato can run this game, meaning you can stick it on any machine, maybe even your work machine, and load it up on breaks to sneak in fifteen minutes here and there; as it's not resourcefully demanding.Desktop Dungeons is certainly worth your time, and boy will it suck up your time as it is highly addictive.If you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

The boss is fixed depending on the level you go in. A really neat thing is, even if you die, the stats of your character are listed at the end of the level.I actually found this game hard due to it being very strategy dependent. For example, your level being very high can actually make the boss of a dungeon very hard, depending on which character class you play as. Add into this random weapons and magic on each dungeon, and a random god that gives you blessings depending on your spells and such, and you got a challenging rpg dungeon crawler.Recommended just for it's difficulty playing it to give you a challenge."

Even though Desktop Dungeons are both these things, I am going to tell you why you should not purchase this game (even at sale). Desktop Dungeons is a game that exhibits a little of roguelike quality into a strategy game that is mainly about killing the boss for each ""dungeon."" You start off with availability to one class and one race and slowly progess by upgrading your town to obtain more classes/races/items/bonuses/etc.. The progression in Desktop Dungeons is fine. The game never forces you to use the same class or race at any prolonged period of time. Because of this, the game is entertaing for a couple of hours as you discover all the ways to utilize your classes/races abilities to give you the best shot at defeating the boss at the end. However, for me, the fun stopped pretty quickly after you unlock the grunt of the different loadouts you can have when entering a dungeon. The reason why it stopped being fun was because in order to beat the level you have to use the bonuses that each race/class has effectively. Thus, when you use a class/race you never deviate from the approach that gives that class/race its edge. Therefore, after you unlock the basic classes, it feels as though there not much deviance from the game to keep the dungeon runs refreshing.The Last couple of hours I played consisted of me logging on to play a dungeon run or two, and then logging off because I felt bored. Since I have stopped playing this game though, I did not experience what the rest of the game had to offer. It is possible that the runs got more interesting, but to me it was not worth the time to go through it, or the money i spent to buy it (while it was on sale).Before I end this review, I do want to share some positive aspects of the game because there were good implements of the game that kept me interested for awhile.-Game has a sense of humor and keeps the game in a light mood even though it is difficult.-There are puzzles in the game which put you in a situation in which there is one method that will make you successful.-If you want to be tested to the limits, these are great-The game explains everything very well and there was nothing that terribly confused me when playing-Game does take good planning to be successful. You cannot simply just click everything to death.Overall I would have to give the game a 6.5/10.I encourage you to look at the other reviews for there are things that I left out about the game. Also, make sure to watch the video on the store page, for that is what the general gameplay of the game looks like. Lastly, just make an informed decision before you hastily bought it like I had."

As the ruler of a kingdom, you construct buildings and recruit heroes to do your bidding for you.  The buildings themselves offer unique perks to improve the efficiency of your kingdom while you take control of a hero as you send them out into the further reaches of your lands on quests.Each quest that you undertake is an entire adventure in itself.  Your hero starts at level 1 and you are capable of leveling them all the way to level 10 during the course of the map.  Each level drastically improves the capabilities of your character and there are plenty of beneficial boosts and magical items to find along the way.Your buildings, on the other hand, offer options such as crafting magical gear, unlocking one of the many unique classes, adding additional boosts and content to encounter on your adventures, and even new races - all of which have their own stats that significantly alter the playstyle of -every- class.The quests themselves are turn-based and give you all the time you need to execute the strategy of your choice.  You'll have to manage your health, mana, and experience as you try to maximize your gains and minimize your losses.  The game is unforgiving, though, very rewarding when you successfully pull off a dungeon and drag home a mountain of treasure.I recommend this game to fans of turn-based RPGs, fantasy worlds, and strategy/puzzle gamers.

That said, I don't enjoy it very much.  I was looking for a game that could I could play quickly on the go or as in between other games and based on the reviews, this seemed to be it.I've played around 15 hours now, and just don't enjoy it that much.  If you like rogue-like puzzlers then it's probably a good game for you.  For me, it just lacks that balance between depth of gameplay and casual mental involvement.  If you approach this game casually, you'll almost certainly never win (other then the few introductory games); and if you approach it to  win, then it's certainly neither casual.I also found the depth of gameplay everyone talks about to be a bit lacking.  After getting frustrated, unable to beat even the first ""normal"" dungeons, I read a couple of the brief introductory help guides on the community page.  Yes, there are some nuances around skills and abilities, but once you get the ""always kill monsters higher level than yourself"", that's about 90% of what you need to understand and succeed in this game.Is there skill involved in this game?  Absolutely.  Is it well done?  Yes.  Could it be a nice, quick diversion or an entire Friday night's gaming session?  Totally.  Is it for me - no.  I feel bad giving this game a thumbs down, and it feels like I'm totally mission something, but for me it just isn't there.  I am compelled to play it from time to time - but unfortunately just in that compulsive ""gotta get the next upgrade"" kind of way, not the good ""OMG I can't wait to play Desktop Dungeons"" kins of way."

It implements the unique mechanic of exploration as regeneration, meaning that the unexplored areas of a map are a finite resource that must be used wisely. Lots of race and class combinations and many dungeons and challenges make for endless replayability. As of this review, I have played over 60 hours and I still feel like I have a lot to learn and that I am improving.Great retro art style and soundtrack/effects combined with the fantasy genre make for a great atmosphere. But be warned, this game is not for everyone - the difficulty level ramps up to the point that it really requires the gamer to do further research via forums and wiki articles for the best strategies, as the tutorials are slightly lacking. You will die - a lot. Thankfully most levels only last an average of 15 minutes. If you feel like you can go no further in the level, you can leave the dungeon and take all the goodies you have found with you.If you are a fan of games that require some nerdy research (like terraria, crusader kings 2, blood bowl) I would definitely seek this one out. Watch some of the Let's Plays on Youtube to get a feel for the game.Due to the difficulty, when I actually pass a tough level the feeling can only be described as or.gas.mic. Maybe the closest feeling would be beating a really hard super meat boy level.By the way, I have rarely felt as though the randomization was unfair. In 95% of cases, the map is definitely beatable as long as you have a very strong grasp on the strategy involved for each class and race, as well as the best way to approach bosses. I have played levels I deemed impossible, only to completely change my strategic thinking and end up beating the level with nearly every single attempt.Is the game worth the price tag? I'd say yes given the hours played. As a bonus, you can actually play this game on the desktop dungeons website (without using steam) by making an account with them and linking it to steam. It saves the game into a cloud and transfers it over to steam. Once I discovered this feature I have been able to play at work on the sly (like I said, I love this game).

,Recommended,226620,9325564,"Posted: 2 March, 2014",all,mark | dj.,"Damn hard. That's what Desktop Dungeons is. Even the easiest dungeons take many tries to finish. This game mixes basic RPG elements with roguelike quests/levels. If you die while trying to complete a quest you have to start all over again. Now, many of the battles (at least in the beginning) can be finished within minutes, provided you know exactly what to do. Completing quests earns you money to unlock and upgrade new classes, and of course, this will unlock new quests for you. All of this should make the game a little easier.But the game might just be a bit too hard because I couldn't even complete 3 quests. And while I still had a good time playing it (mainly because of the short levels) I think the game isn't always well balanced. It requires dedication and effort, -two characteristics I actually possess- but if you have the feeling that you aren't making any progress it's time to quit.Still, a very good and fun game, once and if it clicks, but beware of the difficulty (spikes).[Rating: 72/100]"

The dungeons are largely an order-of-operations puzzle (so-to-speak) and if you get the order wrong, or some other minor thing wrong, you literally cannot win.  The worst thing is when you're down to the last monsters and you know that you cannot beat them because you have done something wrong several actions ago.

My advice: Try the free version, it'll show you the very core of the game. If you like it get the full version.Pros:- Problems to solve strategically: Essentially every dungeon is different and you can solve it in many different ways. But, one or two mistakes and you're done. This is the rogue-like aspect of the game. In the start you'll feel very lost but as soon as you play you'll start using the deep mechanics of the game in your advantage.- Progression and goals to be achieved. Development of your kingdom and uncovering different races, classes, items, etc. through the campaign mode. This is the hook of the game, the RPG aspect, and the way it's done is fantastic.- Huge replayability. The amount of combinations is just enormous. It's always the same idea: get in the dungeon, kill the boss/es and get out, but the amount of combinations of classes, races, deities, items, layout of the dungeon, level of difficulty of the dungeon, badges achievable, etc make every run different than the previous one.- Daily dungeon.- Complex and difficult. This game is all about thinking, the puzzle element is about 70% of the game. I you don't like staring at the screen for a couple of minutes checking your best option then you probably won't like the game. Difficult dungeons take about 20-30 min and you need to be focus all the time.- Good difficulty curve and very good tutorials.Cons:- Can't think of any.Overall this is an extremely well done game (once you play for a while you'll notice this in the little details).

It's nice to be able to think out your next move without something bearing down on you, but the game is designed in a way that will force you to fail no matter how methodical you think you're being if you don't do things in the correct order.I'm sure that you can pour hours into the game and ""figure it out"", but the reality is that the game isn't as engaging as the Steam store page would make you believe.

The numerous times that I sat staring at the final ""boss"" and couldn't do anything because they were higher level than me and was forced to restart (becuase I didn't do things ""in the correct order"") is what forces a negative review.  I'm always down for a good puzzle, but when it looks like an RPG, I want it to play like an RPG; which means that I should have at least some say in how I go about completing it based on my decisions, not the decisions the developers have already made for me.The ""puzzle"" in this game isn't the gameplay, it's the hidden framework of killing things in a certain order and is just masked behind an RPG skin.  You may be looking for this type of game, but I was not."

There's no role playing and no significant strategy involved.Every level is a variation of the same puzzle. The dungeon consists of one tiled screen that's dark. Your character always start at level 1 and must beat a high level dungeon boss. The puzzle is how to level up your character, with limited resources, high enough to beat the boss. Sounds interesting, but there's only one way to do it: beat monsters with higher level than your character. You have a selection of spells, traits and tricks for this goal, and once you figure it out you just have to repeat it. I found the way this plays to be anti-intuitive and contrived.

This game initally starts off very addicted and emerssive. But that only lasted for an extremely short amount of time, leaving me unfulfilled and extremely unsatisfied with my purchase. It's not the gameplay or the game mechanics fault this time as to why it got old fast. This time the culprit was the difficulty. After the inital first few dungeons and extreme enjoyment, the game throws you in a hell hole of a metaphoric toxic goo and pretty much tells you to learn how to swim through it without dying. The tutorials they ""offer"" (using the word ""offer"" very loosely) are not very great tutorials. Instead, to them, the tutorials are basicly just slimmed down dungeons with specific situations with only one SPECIFIC way out to complete with no instructions whatsoever. This makes it impossible to progress further into the game, which stunts the enjoyment to a grinding halt. This COULD HAVE been forgiven if they decided to put a difficulty mode choice option somewhere in the game but that exists just as much as their tutorial instructions do. I would have never paid 15 dollars for this game, had I known that the replay value (do to difficulty) was shorter than a first round knockout match between Mike Tyson and some random crackhead midget. This game is worth maybe about 2 dollars at this point. In my opinion, if the developers were to atleast put in a difficulty option, the gameplay value and price value would rise tremendously. And that's just putting a band-aid on a large cut that needs surgery. That wouldn't REALLY solve the problem here. I DO love a challenge. But I would like to be given a competent tutorial so that I can actually enjoy the game as it was intended to be, which is ""difficult"", NOT impossible.This part here is specifically to the developers:You have a game with a mass amount of potential but you guys need to put more effort into this game. It's not just about making it more aesthetically pleasing from your free game version. You need to step up to the plate and make this game more user friendly. We need a way better tutorial system because the tutorial system in it now is horrible.

You do this by defeating lesser enemies in a logical order, using your class and racial abilities. Enemies don't move, so you have plenty of freedom to think out your moves.

Dungeons generally take 10-20 minutes to complete (or fail) but the base mechanics are addicting enough that I did not find myself saying 'just one more', sessions ended only while glancing at the clock and being surprised enough to force myself to stop.This is a surprisingly deep experience for a somewhat simplified dungeon crawler. Not only are the layouts different each time you start a dungeon (even the same one multiple times) but there is quite a bit outside of these in building up your kingdom and unlocking classes and races. The dungeon mechanics themselves are for the most part pretty standard - move, attack, kill, level up, repeat. The twist here is that as you explore, newly discovered tiles refill your (and any damaged enemy) health and mana bars. The impact of this was lost on me at the lower levels, but as you progress you will find it is impossible to explore the map and plan all your moves ahead of time. There are some abilities that help mitigate this but for the most part, each step is a resource not to be wasted and a wrong turn can mean the difference between leveling up or running out of options seven levels later while fighting the boss.Here lies the first of my two main issues with the game. I have had dungeons where the first half of my exploration resulted in dead ends or creatures far above my level 1 hero you always start as. This can be frustrating as it means you lose out on health/mana regen later on when those tiles could have been useful. I readily acknowledge that this is very much part of the game and there is strategy here above what my compulsion for exploration allows, but it can be hard not to feel that such runs are pointless to pursue.My other issue with Desktop Dungeons has nothing to do with gameplay - the writing takes me completely out of the experience. The game world seems steeped in lore and interesting hero / creature design, yet all the dialogue is extremely casual and self-referential well beyond the tongue-in-cheek point. It's too bad, and is one of those situations where a flaw is almost made worse by the amount of potential it has. I would have preferred the tone to get more serious as I realized how deep the experience could be, and not the other way around. That may be personal opinion, but I really feel as if it is an area of missed opportunity in an otherwise enjoyable and lasting experience.Overall, I would highly recommend Desktop Dungeons to anyone looking for a game that satisfies in a way games like Binding of Isaac or even Spelunky does, where it doesn't matter if you play 5 or 50 games a session and can come back the next day and still find fresh gameplay waiting. The excellency of the procedural generation (which is greatly designed, no randomness here is used as a crutch) is exciting in its balance of interesting and clever levels, and even though the difficulty gets quite high early on you will most likely be able to find fun with it no matter your skill level.---Desktop Dungeons---+ Addicting base mechanics+ Deep experience tied to player skill progression- Some runs can be a letdown at the very start- Writing direction is not for me at allIt is my opinion that you should buy Desktop Dungeons anytime it is $12.50 or less!"

I cannot think of any other like it and it succeeds on so many levels that I am blown away by the amount of time and energy it must have taken to create this. That being said many of my friends would (and have) toss this aside very quickly. The best comparison I can think of for this game would be chess, crosswords, or suduko not because this game operates by the same level or rules but because of the amount of mental energy required to play well (or poorly but with maximum effort in my case).On a high note this game does an excellent job of rewarding progress. Even nearly 80 hours into the game I am still unlocking new aspects every couple hours. The high difficulty factor and this make every finished map lead to both a sigh of relief and quick inhale of anticipation as to what might be next. There are not too many titles you can find that can or will provide this.The game is a puzzle/roguelike/rpg with a steeeeep learning curve. It goes from fairly easy, to somewhat challenging to difficult to ""okay quit smacking me in the balls"" tough in a span of about 2 hours or playtime each at which point the challenge continues to escalate as you progress through each map after. I personally enjoy the challenge but I think this is a balancing issue that is likely to turn away alot of people before they really get into the game. This is a shame because of the amazing amount of possiblities and strategies you can and will need to master to get through it. I have to grudgengliny give it a slight knock for this.The only other major criticism I have is that the tutorial is a bit limited. In a game that gives you such progression the mechanics of many of the aspects are not clearly explained. There are puzzles that come with many of the unlocks that are obviously suppose to help out with this. Unfortunately they are pretty limited (and freakin hard as hell themselves) and do not provide you with much help. This can add on to the frustration level pretty damn quick.The graphics are obviously not the draw here but the cartoony and light-hearteness of the game provide a nice counterpoint to the toughness factor.All in all if you own or play mostly titles that contain the tags ""board games, tcg, puzzles, strategy, tactical"" there is a really good chance this is a gonna be one of your favorites. If your looking for something light-hearted and dislike high difficulty you are likely better off walking the other way.

76561198051248133,Recommended,226620,10625630,"Posted: 21 June, 2014",all,Quincunx,"Overview:Though Desktop Dungeons does have a high learning curve, it is still an addictive and well-designed puzzle roguelike that will keep you coming back for more to defeat its nastier challenges.  As you defeat dungeons and complete challenges, your kingdom will grow, unlocking more races, gods, classes, and items to choose from or find in the dungeon.  The story might not be the best, but the writing is hilarious and should easily keep you entertained, on top of the deep and interesting gameplay.Gameplay:Like I said, everything is a resource, including gold, level-ups (they fully heal you, in addition to giving extra stats), items you don't use, and even exploration!  This is the source of the puzzle nature of the game, as maximizing the utility of your resources to defeat higher-level monsters is essential for defeating the harder difficulties.  Every dungeon has one or more level 10 bosses, who must be defeated to win.  These bosses are appropriately epic, sporting significantly higher stats than the other dungeon inhabitants, so much of the challenge comes from getting to the point where you can take them on.Desktop Dungeons includes a large variety of dungeons and challenges of varying difficulties that will keep you coming back for more.  In true roguelike spirit, all dungeons are randomized each time you attempt them.  While the normal dungeons may just feature a set of monsters and a level 10 boss, the hard and vicious dungeons all have their own gameplay gimmicks which make them feel unique, like separate challenges.  In addition to the standard dungeons, there are also a large number of challenges and puzzles to complete to improve your skills and unlock items.  I can't say I enjoyed the puzzles as much as the challenges and dungeons, but the puzzles are completely optional.As you complete those dungeons, you will obtain gold which can be used to improve your kingdom, unlocking new classes, races, and preparations for dungeons.  These preparations can be used to aid future dungeon runs in certain strategic ways.  For example, you can guarantee that you start with a fireball, a useful preparation for the sorcerer.  By doing so, however, you give up the ability to increase your stats through a different preparation.  These preparations provide a good amount of strategy to a run through carefully planning which ones you will need to defeat a certain dungeon.  They also cost gold, which can be daunting for new players.  However, preparations are never actually required to clear a dungeon, and one preparation even massively increases the gold that you receive from clearing a dungeon successfully.Music:Desktop Dungeons has a pretty good thematic soundtrack by the same person who composed the soudtrack for Super Meat Boy.  There are over 20 tracks, many just to set a nice atmosphere for a given dungeon.  I personally still haven't gotten tired of the music, and I've played well over 100 hours of the game, another testament to how fun and addictive this game is!Graphics:The graphics have a nice, distinctive style, and are pretty good for a roguelike.  However, the gameplay is what makes Desktop Dungeons good, not the graphics.Conclusion:Desktop Dungeons is one of my favorite games, with nearly unlimited replayability and deep strategy.  Most of the negative reviews here focus on the difficult gameplay.  If you want a sense of about how difficult the normal-hard dungeons are here, check out the award-winning alpha version, which is available for free online.  Personally, I think that the difficulty is one of the best aspects of the game.  If you're like me, finally beating a difficult dungeon with a certain class or restriction, is an extremely rewarding experience.  But if you expect a path to beat the game without learning the strategy, you will be disappointed.  The game could be better at teaching you that strategy, but there are guides out there if you get stuck."

The main thing that makes this one interesting is that combat is basically deterministic; you can predict the outcome of each fight pretty accurately, you don't have to worry about getting screwed by the RNG at a critical point.The thing is, this may not sound like a big difference, but  it completely changes the flavor of the game. Instead of an RPG, it ends up being more of a puzzle game, where the objective is to figure out how to maximize XP gained and minimize the waste of health and mana, by deciding where  to go and what to fight next.

You take these tips with a grain of salt as the variability to your death changes with each play-through...Although I use the term ""play-through"" lightly since you never actually get through some of the more hardcore rogue-likes without hours and hours of dedication to understanding the game's many quirks and traps.Desktop Dungeons feels like a solid blend of Rogue-Like and Puzzle with a welcome sense of progression as you earn gold and unlock new classes and races along the way. All of that mixed with the ability to spend 10-20 minutes on a single session is also entirely welcome.The puzzle-like aspect of the game is a great mix to the genre. Instead of spending your time focusing on surviving until your next death, you know exactly what you need to do: kill all of the enemies. The helpful levels that appear next to the enemy names allow you to expect what's coming whether its a victory or a disappointing failure. Rogue-Likes are always known for their randomized nature with their random levels and random encounters; Desktop Dungeons has these to an extent but when you're level 5 and you're about to swing your sword at a level 9, you know you're not making a sound decision. The screen also turns red when your next move is fatal, which helps quite a bit as well.The progression in the game also allows for a sense of accomplishment. No longer do you feel that sense of loss when you lose everything you worked so hard to get. Each ""dungeon"" is its own instance and if you know you're about to fail you can easily just retire and keep all your money (the items you acquire get sold for more money) which can then be spent on upgrading classes, races and even buying gear to aid you on the next quest you go on.Along with multiple locations, there's plenty of different quests and challenges you can attack. Each class has its own set of challenges that give you bonus money and there are also general challenges that give you more gold just by doing things like spending a certain amount of gold or piety during a quest.This game is certainly recommended if you enjoy the difficulty in Rogue-Likes but like to spend a casual amount of time slowly increasing your stats, or in this case, your kingdom."

The world only moves when you a) take an attack (ie, cast  a spell or hit someone, maybe use an item to do so) or b) explore uncharted tiles. But barring specific enemies, you're the only one who ever moves. Meanwhile, your stats and the enemy's stats are visible at all times, including a convenient little tooltip that will tell you what effects come of performing X on Y target (up to and including ""DEATH"" - do not do anything that will result in this!).The game, as a result, comes from mixing risk and reward: do you try and take out a higher-level enemy to start for the bonus XP? Do you spend more time exploring the map (which will potentially raise stats, but also deny you HP/MP regeneration later) to find a weaker first target? Maybe there's a potion a few tiles away, or a handy spell glyph to use? Everything becomes second-nature over time and soon you're playing each race/class (there are plenty of combinations - races give specific bonuses, classes a set of three skills/boons) like... well, not a pro, this game gets hard as heck. But a veteran. A war-torn, blood-stained veteran with plenty of your own corpses in your wake.I absolutely recommend it, but you should really try that alpha if you haven't to get a gist of how this works. It's not your standard take on the genre at ALL.

,Recommended,226620,8658675,"Posted: 11 January, 2014",all,Cabrill,"Stupendously fun game that is essentially a modern day Minesweeper infused with the most potent distillation of role playing mechanics!  You play the wise administrator to a budding town that is pestered by the hardships that accompany being located in the very center of a dense labyrinth of dungeons.  You must hire dungeon-invading heroes of unrestricted race/class combination, outfit them as you can afford and send them into harms way in service of the kingdom!Your first order of administrative business is recruiting a weakling, level one hero, because all of the powerful heroes retire immediately as just reward for surviving a dungeon.  This requires making decisions on which buildings to initially construct with your limited resources.  Your choices determine what race/class combinations you can choose to send into the nearby dungeons, and with what items or services you can furnish them.  Assuming your coffers can afford such bonuses.  Each building you construct provides its own set of bonuses and a unique item selection that can be upgraded.Actual dungeon gameplay consists of moving your chosen hero around a tile-based grid which is covered in the fog of war.  Under each square of fog exists either a monster (level 1-10), an item (or a place to purchase one), an altar dedicated to a specific god, a stat boost, some treasure, or a staircase to a sub-dungeon.  Sub-dungeons offer mini challenges with their own rewards, boost/items enhance your hero's stats or give them new abilities, gods alter your playstyle by forbidding certain actions while rewarding others, and monsters are what you will be primarily hunting for.Apart from scenarios and puzzles, your objective will always be to kill the boss monster, who is always level 10.  In order to slay such a beast you need to equip yourself, and gain levels by finding and eliminating all of the other monsters in the dungeon.  However, they fight back!  Monsters will NEVER initiate attack with you, but they will retaliate when you strike.  After each fight you will need to recoup by exploring the fog of war.  Each square revealed from the fog will replenish your health/mana, but also the health of any unpoisoned enemies.  Once the fog is gone, though, your only means of healing for additional fights are potions or appealing to your chosen god.  Fail to take out the boss before you've expended all of your available resources and you have to retire in shame, with the entire venture possibly a net loss after the cost of preparations.Both the meta-game of kingdom administration, and the individual dungeon dives are very enjoyable.  Spending your limited gold feels critically strategic and there are many possible strategies given the available combinations of race/class/equipment/deity which lead to some very satisfying combos.  Every dungeon is a challenge, and by the end of 10-20 minutes you may actually feel kind of attached to your valiant hero that you will never see again.My only real complaint with the game is that the puzzles are too difficult.  I played about eight of them and each one had a VERY specific solution that had to be performed EXACTLY with no substantial deviations in a chain that can be up to fifty actions in length!  One mistake at any point in that chain and you need to start over.  Some people may enjoy the mental gymnastics necessary to plot out every possible way your hero can move across the board, finding at which points to use which abilities/itemsY and finding the sole solution from a myriad of possibilities - but I didn't.  Thankfully, the puzzles are optional and if you skip them the only thing you'll miss out on is a relatively small sum of gold and some items you could just as easily unlock from doing any of the quests.  Had the game penalized me for not playing the puzzles it would have been a dealbreaker, but mercifully this is not the case.Far more enjoyable than the puzzles are the scenarios in which you play a themed, semi-random dungeon that has an objective that may be something other than killing a boss.  Some of these scenarios feature unique classes specifically for the story, and can be humorous if you read the notes, signs and story.Also, the game uses a cloud sync independent of Steam which allows you to log into an account from any platform (including web) and continue playing!  Overall I'm very impressed with this game and would highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys casual role playing condensed into 20 minute play sessions, fans of Minesweeper or strategy, or anyone who enjoys mind-numbingly difficult puzzles!"

Desktop Dungeons, made by the studio QCF Design, originally came about as a freeware ""alpha"" title, full of challenges and surprises, and that version of the game is still available for download today. I played the alpha for countless hours, so I was in their debt and did not hesitate to make the purchase.Rebuilt from the ground up, Desktop Dungeons now features more content than the most tenacious goblin could ever hope to shake a stick at. The developers would like you to believe this is a ""quick play"" sort of game, but make no mistake, it's going to snatch the afternoon out of your hands and devour it like a ravenous dog. The intense challenge of the dungeons demands your complete attention if you are to succeed. And when you do, hundreds of other dungeons await their turn, eager to throw another horde of savage beasts at your hapless wizard's forehead.The presentation of it is astonishing. The dialogue is superbly written, and the characters all have their own portraits, including - and this is the best part - every possible race and class and gender combination that your character can have. That makes at least 200 different portraits for your player character alone. It is clear that QCF went to great lengths to ensure their brainchild would hold up to the scrutiny of video game critics.I suppose you could find some fault in the game's storyline, but it really doesn't beat you over the head with it. It's only there to move the game along, and works just fine for that purpose. If you like puzzles, or role-playing games, or unique blends of the two, I would highly recommend that you take a look at Desktop Dungeons."

You're a town mayor, and you just guide adventurers to the nearby monster infested dungeons and have them bring back loot. Or die trying. Highly recommended. Really fun and quick game for people who are generally too busy to play games but still want a little something something every now and then. Also there is a web version and I believe you can tie it into the PC version for saves although I am not 100% sure of that and the steam verson may not tie to the web version's cloud save.

If so, get this game.LONG VERSION: Despite the developer's claim that ""reviewers have trouble with genres"", the core genre is simple: At heart, Desktop Dungeons is a strategy game. Success requires careful management of limitted resources. There are plenty of RPG elements in the game, but RPGs are typically centered more on their story, which, lets face it, isn't exactly this game's strong point.Each dungeon has a simple goal: Defeat the boss(es). This is, of course, easier said than done.As mentioned, fulfilling that goal will require very careful management of your resources. Obvious resources are health and mana, but there's also item slots (you can only carry so much stuff), blankspace (exploring unexplored parts of the dungeon regenerates health and mana, but re-exploring already explored parts does not), conversion points (turn items into something else), levels and experience (levelling up fully restores health and mana, which is highly abusable), gold (for buying stuff!), and piety (too complex to explain here). In addition, your class (as well as many other factors) helps define just how efficiently you can use these resources. For example, wizards use less mana for the same bang, monks regen double health from blankspace, and fighters gain experience much faster. Mastery of the game will come from a thorough knowledge of its mechanics, intelligent use of resources, and at times, a bit of luck.It's worth mentioning that this game is HARD. The learning curve is very steep. While you are guided through the basics via tutorial, the rest of the mechanics will need to be figured out on your own. Do not expect to win every time. (However, also notably, this difficulty rarely stems from randomness issues; a highly skilled player should lose in only the worst random situations)This game is also humorous. In fact, it's rarely NOT humorous."

Levelling up gives you 100%health and mana, and you have to exploit this all game so that you don't use too many potions.... you'll need them for the boss in the level.2nd, because it's only 10 minutes, things have to be simplified. You move around on a checkerboard style tabletop. revealing a tile (standing next to it = gaining visibility of the next tile) will restore some health and mana.3rd, this is not a 10 minute game. You can play a dungeon in 10 minutes, sure, so you can play in 10 minute sessions, this can be a positive... but ""just one more, it's only 10 minutes"" will quickly translate into hours of game play.4th This is a Rogue LITE - it does have a progression system where you can unlock new classes, abilities, etc between runs, in a similar way to Rogue Legacy. [A true rogue-like features permadeath where you lose everything and start again at level 1.]For those that like this game, it's addictive. Look at people's play times, the ones that have reviewed this. there are some who have 15-30h, then there are those with 80-120 hours, and the odd one over 200h - that's about the point where you beat the game, from my understanding / reading on the wiki.Do I recommend this game? That's such a hard one. Yes, If you know what you're getting into when you buy it, but the Store description is deceptive, and doesn't really explain just how this game works, and I was dissapointed about that, I wanted more 'hack n slash', and less 'calculating the next 7 steps to level up without using that mana pot' So for me, Although the game itself seems solid, I do like it, and I will play it some more, but I already know I won't clock it if it requires 200h it's a No."

And monsters and items don't respawn or anything like that. So you have to be smart about how you go about killing things, and in what order, and so on.You can also unlock new classes and starter items and such to take into the various dungeons, and there are special challenge dungeons, and some tightly calibrated puzzle levels. It's pretty engaging overall. Made me late to class because I lost track of time.Also the music in the dungeons is pretty great.And the tutorial system is extremely well done. It throws you right into a dungeon that's designed to teach you how to play as you go, without any explicit instructions.

Personally, i find the balancing (especially in RPG´s) to be the most important thing. The Final Fantasy Series (especially 8, X-2, XII) is AWFUL RPG´s, because they are so unbalanced. There is always broken mechanics.But this game. Everything is perfectly balanced. There is a solution for everything. Things that appear useless at first sight (like the glowing guardian) turns out to be immensely powerful when you learn how to use it.And then the final level. Dark Souls... i long thought this was impossible to beat. And i´m a pretty hardcore guy. I must have tried over 30 times... then i started discussing different strategies. Even then, i must have lost 20-25 times... but in the end. It was actually possible.How great of a balance aint that? At first glance, you´re like no way... but then, bit by bit... you understand that it is possible.I have over 130 hours of gameplay in this game. The amount of replay value, and the amount of game you get for the price... is absolutely mind boggling. This game has taken over my life more than any game before. Monster Hunter G. Dark Souls. Meat Boy. Ninja Gaiden. Pokemon. I have mastered them all... but none have absorbed me, and offered me so much joy as this game. Hats of to the developers. And thanks for everything. I love you,A perfect game. I´ve heard some people think the price is to steep... they couldn´t be more wrong. This might be one of the most priceworthy games i´ve ever purchased. Damn it... i have already clocked 47 hours and i can´t stop playing. I need to be working on my thesis, but instead i´m playing this!In all seriousness though, for 13bucks, this is an AMAZING game. It´s so challening, but always fair. It´s incredible well balanced, the music is mesmerezing... the upgrades mechanics addictive. And the gameplay itself is really unlike anything i´ve seen before.Amazing game. 10/10. I haven´t had this much fun with a title since Dark Souls.(The end game is so interesting also... because you have to careful manage your economy)Perfect game."

Take a bottle of wine, for example: I've found that there is no difference between a ten dollar bottle of wine and a thirty dollar bottle of wine. Anybody that tells you otherwise is trying to impress you. With wine, you get very little return on your investment past the 15-20 dollar price point. There's a reason that many sommeliers refuse to do blind tastings, and that reason being that sommeliers have all agreed to subscribe to the same groupthink that says X vintage and Y grapes grown in Z reason are superior, and none of this information would be available to them if they were prevented from looking at the label on the bottle. Have you ever met anyone who's a certified ""master sommelier""? They're truly insufferable people. The next time you meet one ask them a question about wine - any question, it doesn't matter how dumb, will send them into a desperate panic while they fumble to form an opinion, any opinion, about the matter in question. It doesn't matter what their answer is becuase they will be certain to couch it in arcane wine terms like ""tannins"" and ""finish"" and other completely subjective abstract concepts that you won't understand.Desktop Dungeons is like an overpriced bottle of wine. Sure, the label is fancy and the guy trying to sell it to you is telling you about how great it is, using words like ""replayability"" and other nonsense, but as soon as you taste it you realize ""hey, this tastes just like a $5 iphone game?""Just look at the screenshots.

DD has a high replayability and you will have to do several stages and tasks again and again because of wrong class, race, equippment or just one false klick. But in fact that's the thrill: to master the game you have to play some perfect rounds, know all the tricks and skills and of course you need a bit of luck.That sounds less fun than it actualy is. You got to plan and think a lot, but winning a difficult level will outweigh that. The approximately 10-15 minutes of playtime for each stage (when you survive, otherwise playtime can be much shorter ;) ) are well balanced between a short break and not loosing to much time in case of failure.A nice fact is that you can play DD after buying on Steam not only via Steam, but also via the DD website. A nice amusement if you are not at home and on a PC without Steam and don't need download and install anything. That works for Windows RT tablets too.When playing via website please consider, that Steam acchievments will not be unlocked and it does not count to your playing time. Otherwise I would have several hours more.In the end a good occasionally game you should not take to serious.

,Recommended,226620,8792649,"Posted: 20 January, 2014",all,eltee,"This little thing has been sucking up a wholly inordinate amount of my time lately.  It is on its face a little rpg lite type game, where you maneuver a little adventurer around a series of procedurally generated maps looking for loot and baddies to win to level up to face the boss.That on its own would be cool and fun and a little enjoyable time waster, but there is a second 'meta' level of developing your town between quests to gain access to better starting goodies, more classes, races, etc.Even then, I would have been happy to play on its own, but theres something more devious and hooking (for the right kind of personality) than either of those first two aspects.  When it comes right down to it, the game is quite simply far too hard to enjoyably play on just its face value.The tutorials begin to show you the true way, which is that really every map is not so much a dungeon to adventure in, as a very cunning and difficult puzzle in the shape of a dungeon.There is absolutely a 'right' way to pass through each little dungeon that maximizes your xp, items, and chances to victory, and it is almost never the straight forwards way of just running around and clicking enemies as you come by them.You want to slow down, pace yourself, calculate each new move, each new click to maximize the value that you can extract from each scenario.  Sure you can fight a bunch of random level 2 or 3 enemies, when you are level 4, and you will win each fight easily.  However if you alter the pacing, and fight one of those level 3 enemies when you are level 2 instead (and have the right mix of skills/stats/items to win) you'll get a serious XP boost for defeating it.  Multiply that out by the 20 or 30 enemies on a map and you can be a whole level or two higher when fighting the final enemy.Each class and race has some little unique twist which lets you change the rules around and re-optimize your approach, and you can mix and match some of the random dungeon attributes (as you level your town up) to maximize your chances with the mix you choose for each map.TLDR?  This game is far deeper than it appears, its much more tactical/strategic than it is a cute little rpg, and the difficulty level absolutely demands you play to the higher level if you want to get through all the various scenarios of the later game dungeons."

I played free variant for a long time, before picking up this  release.The released version adds more of everything, more monsters, spells, classes, quests, rewards ...This version also has upgraded graphic, making everything more charming.Game play is turn based, with monster being stationary (some bosses have blink spell, that moves them unless you counter it.). At the beginning dungeon has fog of war. You reveal parts of dungeon by moving to adjacent square. You want to be carefull how much of a dungeon you reveal, since each square you reveal, recovers some of you health and mana. This is the main way you will recover health and mana. This means that exploring too much too early can leave you unable to heal, later on. On the other hand each square you reveal can have beneficial items, that you might want. This makes unrevealed tiles in dungeon weary important resource.This is a quick game. Once you get used to controls and basic concepts, you can easily complete a dungeon/quest in 5 min. If it will take you longer it will be because you spend time thinking of best move.Game is also paced quite well, so at the beginning you only have access to one class and one race (human fighter.), but you quickly unlock more.With all that said, it is important to remember that this game is a filler game.

I didn't buy the early access version, but I followed the development closely.When it finally was officially released I bought it immediately and boy was I surprised. I had expected a graphical overhaul and the extra features, but not to this extent! There was just so much more to unlock and do. The devs had upped everything to eleven. New monster types, afflictions, gods, character classes, races, secrets, challenge dungeons, tutorials, the list just goes on and on.The full release really pushed this game to new heights, at least for me. What had been a quick puzzle fix was now a fully fleshed out puzzle game with a mischievious art style and depth like never before + the ost by Danny Baranowsky and Grant Kirkhope is great!I highly recommend this fantastic game.

,Recommended,226620,7754733,"Posted: 25 November, 2013",all,kira v,"Desktop Dungeons is an interesting game and worth looking into, but it's not quite the 'roguelike-lite' that it advertises itself to be. Each dungeon is one level (occasionally with a sublevel with more treasure or more enemies) and your adventurer always starts fresh at level 1 at the beginning of the dungeon, so there's no characters that carry over from dungeon to dungeon. The most notable difference between this game and other roguelikes is that monsters in dungeons do not move and do not attack until you attack, which causes the game to become more of a puzzle game than a genuine roguelike- the challenge comes not from the monsters themselves but rather budgeting your resources and defeating the monsters in the correct way to give your hero as much power as they need to defeat the boss monster and defeat the dungeon.That's not saying Desktop Dungeons isn't entertaining or worth looking into, though. As far as being a sort of time-waster to play inbetween ordering a pizza or during a break at work or something, it fits perfectly since each dungeon could take at most 15 or 20 minutes to complete. The gameplay suits itself well to playing in short bursts rather than sitting down for long sessions and as such is a perfect fit for the busy gamer looking for a more intricate experience over Bejeweled or games on Facebook or something.That being said, I'm not entirely sure this game is worth the $15 price tag. Maybe wait for it to come on sale for $10 or less, then go ahead and make the dive.One final note: The soundtrack, made by Grant Kirkhope (Banjo-Kazooie, Goldeneye, Perfect Dark) and Danny Baranowsky (Binding of Isaac, Super Meat Boy) is excellent and fits the game well. Makes the dungeon-crawling a lot more thematic and interesting than it would have been otherwise."
