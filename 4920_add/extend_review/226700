There is an enormous amount of cheating going on, and the ban waves regularly ban non-cheaters. If I had to guess my Kill to Death ratio was somewhere around 1 to 10, if not worse- but I was scooped up in a ban wave as well.It uses an automated ban system, and they do not use any active moderation for banning. The notorious aimbot sites like artificial are still selling functional cheats that cannot be detected, so their only solution to this was banning anyone who has been reported.I was playing on a stream where it was visible I was not cheating and was still banned. Let that be a warning to other people looking to play this...... ""game"". I submitted a request to have my ban investigated, three months later I still had not received any word back.Unfortunately I was stupid enough to pay 5$ for the in game currency to purchase one of the survivors. Several friends who also paid for in game content were ""caught"" in the ban waves. No way to fight it, no refunds. Let that speak for itself.As you can see I had over 155~ hours in the game, and I tried very hard to give it a fair chance. There were a lot of good core ideas, but in the end it's a very poor attempt to cash in on DayZ popularity with no respect for the player base."

The dev's are always trying to change minor things but never fix what it has to be fixed: crashes, server kicks and include a decent anti cheat to ban 50% of the players that are all cheaters.Almost every week they launch a new patch to ""fix the bugs"" and it brings tons of new bugs on what it was working fine before.The game is clearly unfinished and they ask money for it. Do not buy it!Now they added a hotkey that you can instantly access marketplace and buy items anytime on the game (with real money of course). So if you got hit by a zombie, just press F10 and buy a vaccine. If you're dying of hunger or thirst, just buy some food and meds. You don't need to loot anymore. If you are on an insane PVP and you're out of ammo, just hit F10 and buy some clips for your guns.This is ridiculous pay to win.

,Not Recommended,226700,7785992,"Posted: 27 November, 2013",all,Better Cull Sull,"Infestation: Survivor Stories ( better known as The WarZ ) is a zombie survival sim. It's absolutely horrible, though. The devs took a great idea that had so much potential and... well, turned it to crap basically. Let's start our review off with the Graphics. They aren't bad, but they aren't special or anything. They're just your average everyday video game graphics. Next up, the gameplay. Well, like I said, great idea turned to crap. You can explore a large open-world (if you don't crash within the first 5 minutes of joining a server), which has a wide array of locations from cities to abandoned shacks in the forest. You can explore these areas in hope of finding basic supplies, such as food, water, and health. Once you have the basics covered, you can begin looking for more things that aren't nessecary, but make the game alot easier, such as weapons and armor. Of course, being a zombie survival game, the thing contains zombies. In my short time playing the game, I found zombies teleporting around, spotting you from miles away, and attacking you when they weren't even near you. With the help of microtransactions, you can buy points to use in an in-game store (which kinda ruins the whole survival aspect). I don't know if this was fixed from the time I played, but if you bought points and your character dies, the points ""die"" with the character. Just imagine buying 15 dollars worth of digital credits, only for a zombie to bite you a second after the purchase- 15 dollars down the drain. The replayability would be high, considering you have an urge to play everytime you die and improve. But, because of the state of the game, this factor is significantly lowered. The soundtrack isn't that good. It feels like it was rushed and stuffed into the game, and sometimes tracks play when they're not supposed to. For example, I killed a zombie, and the battle theme kept playing. I checked the area and about 10 minutes later, the track kept playing. Then, of course, it stopped playing right as I entered a real battle.Overall, I would just say don't get it and save your money for something better. I apologize for being repetitive, but, again, great idea turned into crap.hey wow ok super post-publish edit you should probably not get this game thanks"

There for a while it was definitely a pay to win game. Wait what am i saying it is still a P2W game!! You buy GC which tansfers into zombie cash to buy armor/ammo/meds/attachments and in the end instead of spending hours of looting you can spend 5 minutes and $50.00 to get all the loot you want instead of actually looting. I'd put money on it that sooner or later HP will make guns able to be bought for GC/ZC.They said they wouldn’t do that but it  will happen. They don’t hold their word on anything and they constantly allow their game to go on sale and that feeds the hackers and hackers feed on our hard earned loot. Hackers right now run the game. They patch every two weeks and their patches consists of fixes for the previous patch they put out at the last minute! So in the end they screw one thing up that took them two weeks to make and the next patch actually fixes the previous weeks patch.The Devs in the game only care about theirselves. No I didn’t get banned so you can’t say that im salty becasue of a ban i do still play the game just not as much. i used to play at least 8 hours a day and spent hundreds of dollars on this game. I’m just letting people know that it’s not worth their $15.00. BUT if the game goes on sale for 4.00 again which I’m sure it will here soon as they are probably running low on cash then you guys should buy it then and only then. LIke i said i do still play but it gets old when the devs screw their oldest supporters!!

You get a character with horrible and in some cases barely responsive controls, so you can glitch around a horrible world design. I was in  situation where I couldn't jump over 1 foot fence, but I had no problem walking over and on top of people.Fight mechanics... HA! You will spend hours just watching what seems to be a 2 frame motion of your character moving his hand up and down.... up and down... up and down ... until you or the attacker drop. There really is no game here. They use the term ""Open World"" to hide the fact that they didn't ( or couldn't) make such a broken world work for anything else. It really feels like a failed project that original programmer abandon and gave to someone with less skill to develop.

Oh, did I mention you can't uninstall it?This is not a game. This is just a money grab for this company. They hope they will get enough people to build a community so the game keeps going due to people, because they know they got nothing. That's why they invested more effort in marketing of this game instead of developing it.

,Not Recommended,226700,24058344,"Posted: 3 July, 2016",all,Mellow_Online1,"""One of the worst games of all time"" ""An absolute joke""""Worst game on Steam""These were the things I heard when people talked about Infestation: Survivor Stories. This game became centered with controversay back in 2012 because of the developers threatening consumers and consumers revealing that the developers had lied to them and also having one of the worst launches on Steam when it was first released. As well as the developers banning people from the forums of anyone requesting a refund.I've stayed clear of this game for a while but, curiosity killed me and I decided to pick it up during the summer sale.I want to make things clear, this isn't as bad as people are making it out to be, this game doesn't deserve the title ""worst game of all time"" it isn't even the worst game on Steam. Is it bad? yes, it is definately bad, no question or debate about that, but it's not as bad as others are making it out to be, either that or I had my expectations set way too low when I was playing this.In case you hyadn't figured it out from the trailer, Infestation: Survivor Stories was a game that tried to capitalise on the popularity of DayZ (Infestation used to be named ""The War Z"" however due to the bad behaviour of the devs being revelaed, it was removed, then came up again as Infestation: Survivor Stories) Like most DayZ rip offs, Infestation takes everything that people enjoyed about DayZ and then makes them worse, connections, graphics, community all of these things are worse than DayZ.One thing that is included in Infestation, which is kind of a cool idea, is that depending on which server you choose to play on, you will play on a different map, I say that what I really mean is that out of the 8 servers, there are 2 different maps. If you have 8 servers, why not add in a different map for each server? Was there something limiting you from doing that, some sort of restriction?The maps themselves, however, are really big, around a 74km2 mile map, There is also alot of unique areas around the map that you can encounter and are used frequently to make sure there's always something to see and something that you will want to check out, which is more than I can say for the other DayZ clone that this company made (Aftermath).One thing that you'll realise quickly however, is that the devs purposefully make the good equipment hard to find, when I say hard to find, I mean really hard to find, as in there's a 1/1000 chance in finding it, that's where the f*cking microtransactions come into play. Obviously if you're going to rip off a popular gam, charging £20 as it's base price and then half a*sing everything, you need to make sure you get even more money from it as well by putting in microtransactions for outfits, armour and weapons.The community on this is mostly horrific. You might find the odd good player that is willing to team up with you, but it's primarily hackers, cheating and the devs doing little about it, however, now that there's barely anyone playing it, it's hard to come by these guys anymore, however they're still present throughout the game.The zombie AI is also terrible, all you need to do to beat them is walk backwards and mash the LMB and you're guaranteed a win, they only become a big problem if you have zombies coming from different directions. Zombies don't even appear to be a huge problem when they're in hoardes, whereas zombies would usually be. There is also no way you can sneak by a zombie, once you enter their proximity (even if you're behind them) they will come after you regardless.The graphics are mostly bad. If you're looking at a view, surveying the area or something along those lines, the graphics look quite decent, however, as soon  as you get closer to something, you will notice how badly textured they are.I will agree that this is a bad game, but I wouldn't stress out that it's one of the worst game on Steam, as I can easily see more games that I've covered before that can fill that hole, like Day One: Garry's Incident, Second Warfare or The Slaughtering Grounds. I will agree on the fact that this is nonetheless a bad game with minimal effort put in and it's only use was to be a cash grab and try and piggy back on the popularity of DayZPros+ Decent graphics from afar+ Huge map+ Can be fun exploringCons- Bad textures-Bad AI-Hackers-Microtransactions-RipoffFinal verdict: 4/10My Steam Curator group:http://steamcommunity.com/groups/MellowReviews"

I totalled about 10 hours of ( at times forced) gameplay.(Graphics) - It has a beautiful landscape I give it that, but is also a FORCED beauty on your machine. The recent updates took away almost all controls over your video/hardware settings and forced all players to run at what the Developers want you to run.  The outcome is an even more terribly optimized experience rendering all low-end pc's ( fps 30 before update, ran great) unoperable. Fps even for high-end users is a 10 fps experience due to lack of extended work.(Gameplay) - The gameplay varies but is generally just as terrible. The difference from the critically acclaimed DayZ and this { turd taped to a radiator} is that this is heavily influenced by the cash shop. Everything required for long term survival is bought on the cash shop i.e powerful guns/equipment/ammo EVERYTHING. Safe zones are camped, item spawns are not randomized and are also camped. Game time can consist of short survival times due to cashshoppers and the frequent HACKER.(UI/Community/Support) The maps are big enough, but are suffocating when the server is full. Aside from a couple small settlements and a handful of cities there is NOTHING outside of those areas. Lots of space and very barren unless you love seeing trees. The zombie mechanics are horrible, they run twice as fast as you and apparently have a 10ft reach. The game has glitches left and right and have not been addressed at all. The Developer support is almost nonexistent with little to no cooperation with the community. The weekly updates consist of no major update fixes to glitches and consist of Dev's either ""saying"" they will be doing an update or going on little breaks. There is no major support from the Game Dev's and have not been any in a long time.I give it a Charlie Brown rating of meh/10. Move along people, nothing to see here"

Then, I jumped up behind a barricade, and almost immediately I received few hits to the head and also died instantly, even though we both had full stuff gear and snipers on us, we died easy peasy.

We went up on that roof and saw that player somewhat 200-300 meters in front of us and I stuck my head out to aim him with my magnum, and then I received 3 hits from him and died before I even noticed my health going down which was a surprise because I had a full skill tree. My friend, also died the same way have I.Later, whilst consistently checking the I:SS game blocks twitter bans, I have not seen the nickname of that player, it was clarified that this game is f. up and all of it's systems.

The game has been poorly optimized since day 1 challenging the greatest of graphics cards with poorly rendered areas and straight up disrespect to optimizaiton. Hacking albeit progress has been made is still a major issue with the devs struggling to keep their software and systems up to date with the latest releases. One of the key elements of the game is the ability to group up and share the expierience with your friends. However this becomes more of a challenge than the zombies themselves with huge amounts of map to cover with relatively little supplies and the constant threats of the world. The game is just out-matched in its market with the Day-Z standalone just recently released I'd reccomend to anyone to spring for that it is worth the extra money then what you'd be getting with this cash-grab."

It has so many problems, hackers end your fun and take your hard earned gear. I have a graphics card that can run high detailed games fine, but the graphics on this game are so terrible and can cause FPS issues. What really makes me dislike the game is that players can simply buy their way into surviving and have all this gear they never even found. But no, it gets worse. Ammo is appearently very rare in the game, being 3x harder to find than actual guns! The guns seem to deal low damage to both zombies and players, which in this case, need more ammo. Where can you get this ammo? You can get it via purchase. I didn't realize that it takes 3 shots with a shotgun to kill a SINGLE zombie. The delevopers pretty much made the guns weak so that they would need more ammo, more ammo that people have to buy in order to get enough to for 1 emergency. This game has an endless amount of problems and issues that im not going to get started on. The only thing I like about this game is how the loot is placed around the map (hat on a dresser, gun in a gun rack, etc.) and more of the buildings are enterable. But aside from only 2 things I thought was well done, I don't recommend this game.

The controls are choppy and the damage you can do vs the zombiesis disheartening. However gameplay problems aside thats not the reason why I don't recomend this game, its the customer support and the way they deal with players. Given that games through steam, especially ones that require an account, can't be changed once initialy set. This makes it impossible to play the game if anything happens.  If you look on my record, you can see that I have barely any time on this game, that is due to the way the game works. If you die, theres a 24 hour cooldown before you can play again. Its fine I'll play a little bit, and if I die turn the game off. After getting the 7 or so hours of total play time, I was tired of playing. I uninstalled it and went on to play other games.Months later, I see the new update and decide to play it again to see if anything was made better. And to my surprise I find that my account is banned. Why was it banned? I haven't played the game at all. I decide to contact customer support about the problem, perhaps they can shed some light on what happened or what they mistakenly think happened in game. January 10th was when I sent them a support ticket to repeal the ban, they only just got back to me today saying there was detected uses of exploits or programs to basically cheat the game. And that because this so called detection was against their agreement they won't unban the account. Now remember I haven't played the game at all in this entire time they say something happened. So how could I have suposedly done any of this? Their answer? ""We are unable to provide any further detail regarding the results of our investigations due to its sensitive nature."" So the information about my account is sensitive and unable to be shared with me, the account owner. They won't overturn the decision cuz it aparently is against their terms even if it may be their mistake in the first place, and I can't make a new account cuz its perminately tied with steam, making it a useless game stuck in my library.I can deal with crappy gameplay mechanics and annoying texture glitches and such. I can deal with boring gameplay and whatnot. I can ignore all that, but when a company doesn't want to help its players in their own game. That is where I draw the line, and this is the reason why I do not ever recomend this game or any of their future products."

However, the developers made a mess of it, instead focusing on adding more and more content and complicating things by constantly changing loot spawning rates and postions, making it impossible to actually set up with a group of friends in one location. By failing to address the needs and requests of the community, they allowed this game to flop and become a sore point for any self-respecting survival player. Anyone looking to purchase a survival game, avoid this one, if you're set on a zombie survival game get Day-Z or, for an interesting twist, Nether, though as for the latter there is again the worry that it could also follow the same path as ISS did.EDIT 19/06/2016Do not fall for the new developing Infestation World game currently underway, a huge number of previous ISS players who cheated in ISS, have already moved over to IW and continued cheating, the GC redemption that has been offered is, frankly, a joke, and a pathetic attempt at buying previous players, who will be thoroughly dissappointed, as you will only recieve compensation for GC present in your account currently, and only if purchased within the last year or so. If you're going to remake an already bad game, nearly just as badly, don't then also be utter cheapskates to not transfer more GC that plyers have purchased. I know players who (albeit foolishly) have bought at least 40,000 GC, and yet are only compensated with a trivial 1000 or even less since that's all they currently have in their ISS accounts.

You will learn how much walking sucks a$$. It takes 20 minutes just to get to 1 looting area. They added cars but guess what.. you need GAS and REPAIR KITS that you need to PAY for EACH ONE just so the cars will work (They are buggy as HELL). AND they made it so there is only 3 cars per server. Forcing you to pay to get it running. When you play this game, you take a chance of Fairfight banning you for no reason what-so-ever and there goes your money with the game ;D God forbid they ever fix their damn game performance or do anything for the players.

,Not Recommended,226700,9193742,"Posted: 20 February, 2014",all,Lurch,"First, a warning: The developers of this game will bend you over and f*ck you, hard and deep. They are the worst kind of scumbags on the internet.Originally titled The War Z, Infestation: Survivor Stories has some very innovative perspectives on survival FPS's. Akin to DayZ, it's vast open world full of zombies and loot allow for hours of gameplay. But, unlike DayZ I:SS offers a unique EXP system and persistent inventory comparable to the stash system from Diablo or PoE. But all of this is for naught, as the EXP is just that, an accumulation of EXP with nothing to spend it on, and the persistant inventory/stash would be GREAT, if not for the horrible lacking of items to find and the Pay to Win MTM.The game intentionally tries to make you less than self sufficient, forcing you to either buy from the MTM, starve to death, die of Dehydration, or have almost no ammo, ever. Guns are also scarce beyond everything you'd ever imagine. If you find a shotgun, good luck finding ammo for it, and STANAG's are more rare than Sniper Rifles.So be warned, this game is full of empty promises, corruption, and greed.Update: I returned to this game after an 8 month hiatus, and alot has been fixed. Many of the stability issues have been fixed, the spawn rate of items is acceptable (but certainly not lucrative), the skill tree has finally been implemented, vehicles have been added and missions have improved the rate in which you accumulate in-game currency you can spend at settlements. Also, the in game currency feels much more reasonable to spend to get items.Update 12/14/14: This game has inherent flaws in the combat mechanics, there's a massive hole in the anti-cheat system making the game vulnerable to cheaters, the spawn system could use some improvement, and stability issues plague this game. The recent patch has really done a service to this game by removing the revive timer. All in all, though I:SS can be fun to play, it's still not a game I'd recommend.TL;DR (12/14/14): NOT RECOMMENDED"

We got loads of loot..LOADS OF IT. But then later something stranged happened....at blue ridge safe zone I saw 2 guys doing something with guns. There were only 10 people on the server including me so I ran to get closer and they looked like they were dooping snipers. At first I though that was dumb and stupid but I look now at it and see that hacking was everywhere. 80% off all infestation players are Hackers. So the zombie AI is rigged, no player is friendly, frame rate sucks, guns suck, hacker's always ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥new spawns, constant kicking by fairfight, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ dev's like Artimes Knives.

,Not Recommended,226700,10020563,"Posted: 4 May, 2014",all,tercenya999,"BANS- Bans everywhere. There are a lot of cheaters in this game, and Hammerpoint solves it by handing out bans for the slightest thing. Your account can be banned because you alt+tabbed. My first account was banned just because I was walking through a forest.- If you write a support ticket, you will never be answered. A year has passed since my 1st account was banned and I am still waiting for my tickets to be answered.- If you ask for your money back, they will only agree to give it back by means of a transfer to you bank account in Azerbaijan (which nobody has).- I asked PayPal for a refund and they gave it back instantly, so imagine how much of a scam this is that PayPal knows they have to give you the money without inquiring you further.GRAPHICS- Trailers show you very nice graphics, which you will never see again in-game. They are lying to you.- This game is badly optimised. That means bad graphics but high requirements. I play on an Alienware M17X with minimum specs and I can't go over 40 FPS when staring at the ground. Out in the open with zombies on screen and such it's usually 20 FPS.- There used to be a trick where you could create a .ini file in your game directory so you would disable ambient occlusion, grass movement and other stuff upon launching the game so it would work better, but now Hammerpoint decided to forbid it. If you have a .ini file in your directory you get a ban, yes, a ban for changing your system specs, like wtf.GAMEPLAY- Cheaters everywhere. You will see people flying, aimbots, X-Ray vision, etcetera. This is not too frequent, but it is there.- It is very hard to find loot because people keep looting all the good spots, then they switch servers and loot the same spot again.- Spawncamping. You log in with your fully equipped character and you're shot in the head from behind by a camper. You lost everything. Nice, fair. In some servers you can't even leave the safe zone because there are 20 people with shotguns waiting at the edge to shoot the first guy who steps out of it.- Hammerpoint created an item: the lockbox. With that item you may loot a spot of your choice and put everything in the lockbox, where it will be kept safe forever. So basically Hammerpoint is fostering all these server jumps and looting.- Why? Because they want you to pay for premium servers (with enhanced loot) or rent your own server (where you can play alone) for 50€ a month.- It's pay-to-win. Yes, everything in the store can also be found in-game, but a guy who spent 5€ in mags has unlimited ammo compared to your single STANAG 30 mag. Plus bags to carry more stuff, night vision, protective gear, etc.- People who pay can instantly log back in when they die and recover their stuff, while non-paying players must wait 30 minutes.- Zombies are broken. Let me explain in detail.- Hitting them will interrupt them, so you may stunlock any zombie just by hitting him with your fists at timed intervals. This makes you immortal as long as you have extreme patience and you can pull them one by one.- Zombies always appear to stagger when you hit them, but if you hit 2 zombies, one will hit you back. You will only interrupt one of them. So you may swing your katana through 5 zombies and all of them will fall back, but you will unexplicably get 4 hits on you.- Some zombies have running or jumping animations. In these cases you must spam melee attacks because you don't know where they are. The special buggy animation zombies can be anywhere, not where you see them. You will get hit by those guys at least once most of the time, which is really unfair.OVERALLThe game is entertaining. It's a great idea in the wrong hands. There are online petitions signed by thousands of players asking Hammerpoint to let go of this game and let some real developers manage it, but they won't. So long story short: if you see this game for 2€ Steam offer go ahead and try it, otherwise don't even get close."

Trees have taken over the world. I wander throughout the day with my flashlight on, until I come across what appears to be a large amount of zombies surrounding a random spot in the road where everyone has decided to park their cars and leave. I approach with caution. I run up and jump onto the back of a truck. That's when I find myself a delicious candy bar. I enjoy this sweet piece of tastiness. Then the zombies learn to climb. I bash their skulls in with my flashlight with ease. I pick up a rifle to pick off the rest. Little did I know, it had no bullets. Gun is useless. Zombies are now entirely surrounding me. I spend the next half hour breaking the heads of the zombies with my extremely durable flashlight until the coast is clear. I make a run for it. I find a farm, but unfortunately, it is filled with nothing but duct tape. I also found a glow stick, but alas, my small kindergarden backpack could not carry any more, as it was filled with tape. That's when I set out to find a home for the night. I search effortlessly, when I finally see a city. It is very close, I start to run. Suddenly, zombies start teleporting to my location. What do I do? Kill them with my flashlight. Oh no! My flashlight no longer hits where I tell it to! I swing but no matter how many times the light makes contact with the zombie, it continues to brush right through it! I am forced to run. I run to the city, finally safe. I find a revolver on the ground, good. Now I can survive better. Wait! No I can't! Sniped. My journey had ended. As I die, all of my duct tape falls out onto the ground. Then... Oh man...

When it had first came out, the devs thought that lying about the game and it's features would get it to sell better. It worked, but then people realised that said features never existed, and the devs were profiteering off of an unfinished game. As it stood in Alpha when this was going on, the game was barebones and was still clearly, very unfinished. Since then, there have been random account bans and hackers who broke through the game's coding and transaction info to get lists of players, along with their personal details. Although it got fixed, the damage had already been done. There was even a case where the game's original name, 'The WarZ', was changed because of copyright infringement issues with the upcoming film 'World War Z'. Hell, even people are seeing comments and reviews being deleted because they have noted the game's shortcomings!From that point on, Infestation has seen a lot of new features and patches, making the game that little bit more bearable. But it still isnt enough to stop armies of no-clippers and ESP users who ruin the game for everyone else. The game still isnt finished, and many bugs are still prominent, after being out for over a full year on Steam. Don't get me wrong, the game has seen times where it has been enjoyable to play, but then patches and such will fix a few bugs, but change other features, worsening the gameplay further. The micro-transactions are also ludicrous, and spending some cash really isnt going to make the game any more fun than it is.To summarise and emphasise my point, Infestation: Survivor Stories is a tale of what might have been. Had the producers taken more time to listen to their customers and never scammed them silly, it wouldn't be such a broken game. Personally I believe money is better spent on something else, and not this absolute pile of crap. 2/10.Edit : As of 15/12/16 (15th December, 2016) the servers for this game have been shut permanently. Those who still own the game seemingly won't be compensated for it, and a F2P version has been added to the Steam Store, known as Infestation - The NewZ. An incredibly underhanded move by the developers, the game is a few years old and many people bought it, only to face an early shutdown. The NewZ has a different development team but they've pushed the game in an entirely different direction - loot is extremely abundant and you can fully gear yourself within minutes of spawning. It puts a lot more emphasis on PVP instead of Survival, which may or may not be something you'll want. I've encountered no hackers within just short of 30 hrs of gameplay and the anti-cheat is different. If you are curious to try it feel free, there have been a lot of changes for the better."

The servers are not well kept and are filled with snipers with aimbots or speed hacks. There is not much to do except collect gear and run through the world and get mad ever time a hacker walks through the wall and kills you. Its only 5 dollars though so if you looking for a cheap way to get really♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off very quickly then ISS is the game for you. The only up side to all this NOTHING there is no upside. I have a good bit of time on this game and ton's of gear but still its really not all worth it even with a new map there is still nothing to do. The developers really need to get there Sh$$ togeather and fix the real problems before they add things into the game. The Devs are not very nice either. They are very money hungry they took the survival away from the game when they put an in game store into the mix. So if your a hacker or just have money to spare you can just gear up and get all the ammo and armor/meds that you want and never loose. My conclusion to all this ramble is if you want to get a cheap survival game for 5 bucks please please please dont buy this one i can assure you it is a huge waist of your time.

I was a virgin as well. I had only kissed a couple girls, not much other than that to be honest. My best friend, Liam, always got women. He always told me that talking to girls was easy and not scary at all, just don't be a scared little dog and do it. I always wished I had his confidence. I asked for help to get a girlfriend/someone to ♥♥♥♥ so I wouldn't be a virgin finally. He said he'd help me, I was so damn happy and scared at the same time.So one day he decided to take me to a party he was going to. He was content on getting me laid finally. I was nervous asf. I had a few drinks and I saw a girl I thought was a solid 8/10. A little feral though. Liam saw me looking at her and laughed. I asked him what was funny and instead he pushed me into the same girl. I apologised and was freaking out. Liam came over and said ""This here is my boy, he acts shy but he's a ♥♥♥♥ing god. Treat him right."" and took off elsewhere. The girl giggled and told me her name was Olivia. Even thought my autism kicked in and I was a complete idiot we hit it off. A guy she knew came over and told her to come have a smoke with him. She said yes as he grabbed her hand and started walking off. She asked me if I smoked, I have never but I said yes anyway cause I wasn't letting this dog take her away from me. I inhaled my first cigarette and naturally I had a coughing fit. They laughed but it was all good. 1 year after that party I was dating Olivia. She took my virginity and we hit it off. I started smoking more often because why not, life was good. I loved her more than I will anything.At least it was until Olivia dumped me.Olivia cheated on me with Liam. Multiple times. The love of my life and my best mate.I became immensly depressed and started chain smoking. At least a pack a day. I did this for a solid 7 months.

Glitchy, poor animations, and much slower and incomplete than DayZ. Zombies are difficult to kill, and not because of their abilities, amount of health, or movement - but because of poor hit detection, hit radius, and other aspects that were poorly programmed (The animations and hit registration don't match up aesthetically) You clip on objects that you shouldn't clip on, and don't clip through things you would think would stop you. Don't waste your money, even if it's $2.67.Edit: Furthermore, I recently went back to try and give it a second chance, since I had already given the developer my money, and found out that I was permabanned for this comment. Now they have my money and have technically robbed me of the experience (or lack-there-of) that I paid for.They've refused to respond to my tickets. Spiteful, poor development, etc. I honestly don't wish negative things on people or businesses often, but their product and business practices have convinced me that these people don't deserve jobs in product development and I hope reading this will deter as many purchasers as possible to prevent this developer from getting any further. They already believe they're immune to proper practices, clearly, and if they gather enough money they'll just be in the position they want to be in: too big to fail.

Good concept.Cons:1. Really crappy developers that does what THEY think is best for the game, not listening to the community at all.2. Low resolution graphics, pixels are showing really well at most points.3. The ambient sounds are the worst I've ever heard, mostly annoying and adds nothing to the game.4. The game is FILLED with hackers.

How they haven't quit or offed themselves from sheer shame for making this abomination leads me to believe that they have no dignity, self-respect or knowledge of right and wrong. I'm serious. They should be making daily apologies to all the deranged players that have such poor taste in gaming or are just so easily entertained that they actually enjoy this offensive excuse for a game. Anyone who is associated in the production of this game should be laughed out of any future game development career. (Expect whoever did the gun modeling / gun sounds. That isn't too shabby, but you'd never know because you rarely fire a shot.)There is not a single redeeming quality to this plague. The concept was torn from DayZ, the devs make empty promises, the support is nonexistant, there are hackers in every server, there is FPS lag no matter your specs or quality settings, your account infomation is not at all safe and the prices for items ingame are inexcusable.Please look into ""WarZ emulators"" if you must try this game. The source code was ripped a while back and several emulators popped up. The emulators not only run the game better, but have more features and less bugs.

I rate this game a 1/10 because the experienced players basically sit around and snipe eachother, there are very few weapons available and every time I find one some d-bag camper snipes me from a half a mile away and takes my stuff.  If you want a gun you'll either get lucky and find one with very little ammo or you can buy one at the store, because we all know that guns are still available via cash purchase during a zombie appocalypse at a gun store...If you don't want to waste real world money on guns and equipment, then this game is not for you.If you want to play with other people cooperatively then this game is not for you.If you want to use one of the melee weapons available to take out zombies you had better have some really good MMORPG pulling skills because after one fight with 2-3 zombies your character will not have the HP left to continue on.

Ammunition was so rare at this time that pvp wasn't possible to do if u don't get some out of the cash shop (never used it tho)Went pretty mad that I bought this game and stopped playing it forever.I highly recommend that u start thinking about killing yourself if u really think about buying this game.0/10 this game sucks hairy balls.BTW since the day I played with this friend this game .

The game was originally advertised as being totally free to play with the purchasable items being cosmetic. this is something that they refuse to enact in practice, as you can buy all sorts of spiffy backpacks, guns, and blades (rentals too, of course) and some of these weapons can never be found in game, as well as being vastly stronger than their non cash-shop weapons.in short, a scam by any other name is still a scam."

Every single time you spawn in you get rekt by the zombies or get spawn killed because the spawns are terrible.

It is so terrible that you should probably lick a cactus, if you have bought this game please gauge your eyes  out because of the♥♥♥♥♥♥graphics. I'm almost positive that the most fun part of this game is watching it be refunded because it is terrible on so many levels.

But since the developers abandoned the game and the game goes on sale literally every month. This makes even more hackers!

,Not Recommended,226700,7934937,"Posted: 5 December, 2013",all,Stephen Cold Bear,"So I had put off buying this game due to all the horrible reviews, metacritic rating, and the fact the developers basically p*ssed all over loyal players/paying supports of previous games(War Inc) but I desided to give it a shot anyway since it was on sale for $3.Let me start by saying most of the horrible reviews are true.-Graphics?Low quality and poorly optimzied. That means it's not super pretty but still runs slowly.-Sound?Your own SFX(footsteps, splashing,etc..) are way too loud if you have SFX set to a level so they actually help you detect threats. Sound also doesn't seem to be optimized properlly. Locating something by sound is hit or miss.-World?The map is very large. With lots of locations to explore. It would probably take near an hour to walk from one corner to the other. That's great but it can be VERY inconvient is there is no quick travel or selective spawning. But ultimatly there is still only one map. There also aren't that many building models and you will see things reused a lot.-GamePlayExploring, avoiding zombies, collecting supplies. All fun.Ranged combat is fairly tuned as it was ported directly from War Inc.Melee combat is horribly simple and poorly done on top.Zombie AI is horrible. They get stuck. Can't climb anything over 2ft.-Community?The game has a fairly large community that usually fills a couple of the 100 player servers constantly with lots of smaller servers as well. However, the majority of those players have a kill on sight attitude. Youre not likely to make many friends you didn't bring with you.-Grouping?There is a basic group system which allows group chat and disables ""friendly fire."" There is no easy way to simply join and play with your friends. Due to the prementioned huge map and random spawning it's very likely that you will join a server and be near the people you actually want ro play with.-Pay to Win?Yes. The game is Buy to Play and Pay to Win. Supplies(food, water,bullets) are not easy to come by in game but for a couple of dollars you can easily stock up on what would other wise take several hours to gather if youre lucky.-Fun?Strange but Yes. The game is FAR from polished but if the stars align and you manage to meet up with your friend(s) on an low-medium populated server there is much fun to be had from the sandbox elements combined with lite PvP.-Recommend?I would recommend buying this game. On sale. Don't spend over $5. Sure it can be fun but it's the type of fun you would expect from a low budget indie game, which Infestation is not. There are just to many things wrong and the developers can not be trusted to give the game longevity or proper support(see War Inc.)"

I never have written a negative review before but this is a first. The mechanics themselves seem shoddy, appearences are bad, and the overall system is much to be desired. Respawn times on death (1 hr apart) and a microshop that promotes using it to survive make things only worse."

,Not Recommended,226700,9692951,"Posted: 1 April, 2014",all,Who's that Pokémon?! - NaiOni,"Putting the controversy aside, judging the game on its own merits, this is still not a good game. It suffers from poor controls, bugs, terrible AI and subpar graphics. Try getting into a car. If you get the opportunity, just try it. Have fun with that, because you're going to be there for a while. You have to look in a very exact spot, in the centre of the cars front, somewhere between the front seats. Then you have to run against the car, back and forth, grinding against its surface, until you've kind of glitched yourself into it. For a split second you'll get a prompt to enter, so you better be ready to press the button, provided you know which one you have to press. For minutes, you'll aproach the car from different angles, aim at different point of the car, grind yourself into it, climb it, hit it out of frustration, and missing button prompts. When you finally get in, you'll realise that cars in Infestation do not controll with WASD. They controll with the arrow keys. But this will not matter for long. As soon as you get to an elevated part of the road, you'll find it has collapsed. Now, you might think you might be able to make it to the other side if you charge at it at full speed. You won't. You see, if there is even the tiniest object in the way, your car can't pass it. See a gap between 2 cars you think you can easily fit through? You can't.After ultimately giving up on the car, you'll make your way into the city on foot, fighting a few zombies on the way (circle strafing is perhaps a more apropriate description. Fight would imply actual combat). Here you'll find the games strongest part. The worn down, flooded city I got to, actually looked pretty gorgeous. It was overgrown with vines, large gaping holes in buildings, and water covered streets. It is a shame that such a sight has to grace such a terrible game. Then you'll start asking yourself; ""did the zombies cause the flood?"" ""did they destroy the road?"" ""did they put the holes in the houses?"". Perhaps there's an answer to that in the game. But at that point, you're no longer playing the game. In fact, you've probably uninstalled the game at this point.You see, this game isn't just bad because of the controversy and the micro transactions. It isn't bad because of the unjustified bans during the beta. It isn't bad because it is a ripoff, or the promissed features missing from the game. It is bad because it is a bad game. It tries to be DayZ, but that is not the problem. The problem is that it doesn't commit to it like DayZ. DayZ is ruthless. It is hard. The axe is heavy, and can't be swung fast. Gear is hard to find, and is often located in dangerous areas. Infestation feels very light weight in comparison. You spawn with bandages, gear is everywhere, there are very few players to kill you, the zombies, while being able to take a lot of hits, provided you haven't found a weapon yet, are easily killed by just circling them. If they can't hit you, they don't provide a threat. Infestation doesn't have the lingering threat of injury, food poisoning, blood loss, hunger and dangerous encounters with players, and the stress that comes with those things. This is what makes DayZ great. It is the reason you can't make a ""DayZ lite"" for more casual players, because you lose what made it great in the process. DayZ may suffer from clunky controlls, but contrary to popular belief, the game itself is not clunky. When you get used to its controlls, it is smooth sailing from there. Smooth sailing with the constant threat of death blowing in the wind...Infestation is a game wich suffer from many problems. But more than anything, it suffers from the very fabric of its existance. The idea and concept it was build on. The game is a house built with poor features on unstable, flawed-by-design foundations. In the absence of DayZ's ruthless, unforgiving environment, Infestation provides nothing as a suitible replacement. It is a poor mimic, with watered down mechanics and nothing but superficial imitations of DayZ's ruthlessnes, with none of the weight. No matter what angle you aproach it, Infestation: Survivor Stories is a broken game, whether it be mechanically, by design or as an imitation. It doesn't hold up against DayZ, and it doesn't hold up on its own. All of this is made blatantly obvious in less than an hour of playing. Don't let the title fool you, it was, still is, and will always be the WarZ, and it still suffers from the same problems."

So many bugs in the game with each patch if there ever is one.(when its good its barely once a month when its bad we have gone like 4 months with no patches what so ever). Anyone that is new will have the hardest time finding loot because of how rare everything is besides krugers which are crap. The tutorials made by artemis knives was terrible as when he was killing zombies he used a weapon that is only found in really populated zombie areas and you start with a flashlight which takes 12-20 hits to the head to kill a zombie. Now the vetrean players who like to farm have to do with the super zombie which takes 2 1/2 clips with the saiga shot gun or 200 shots with a LMG for the tinyest chance to get a sniper but what usally you get would be like a Scar or imi tar with 30 shots which is a terrible trade off.

,Not Recommended,226700,9297904,"Posted: 28 February, 2014",all,[CAP] cap10zeus,"Well after months of playing the game and almost 1,600 cumulative hours (spanned over six accounts), and being very patient with the development of it - the last draw for me was the in-game lockboxes. Lockboxes are part of an integral part of the game in my opinion, especially if you're playing the game in PVE style, which is how I was playing the game with my family - hence the six accounts. The game has much potential for both PVP and PVE styles, and if you've followed the author's customer service track record, you'll find that they have no regard for their fan base - they claim otherwise. I submitted a ticket explaining my situation regarding a particular item (lockbox) that I've placed on my personal rented server ($50 month) of which I play the game in PVE with my friends and family. I personally stopped playing the game for a few weeks, but my wife and some friends have been playing on my private server continuously.Well, I came back in to find a wonderful surprise as I was looking for my 16 lockboxes I had left around the map weeks earlier. I could not find one single lockbox! I thought maybe because of my inactivity, the lockboxes might have been returned to my Global Inventory… nope, not the case.  Lockboxes can cost (at the author’s discretion), between 150 game credits up to (what I’ve seen) 750 game credits and I’ve got (had) a total of 21.My problem with the game is in the following; the authors can do changes to the game with little or no notice to the players, and if you try to look for help (as in their ingame experience) there is virtually none! You’ll find this a continuous problem with other players in their own forum. I’ll give you my own example: When you go and buy the lockboxes in their marketplace, there is no mention anywhere that the lockbox you are about to purchase can disappear if you place it in the map and leave it unattended for a period of time. Mind you, this information IS buried somewhere in their forum and you’re supposed to know that, because they make it a point when you first spawn in to figure these things out, and you’re an idiot for not doing so – as ArtemisKnives will let you know on his twitch.After 1,600 hours of ingame experience, I discovered that placed lockboxes do indeed disappear if you don’t access them in three weeks. You can be playing the game during that period, but if you don’t get your character to actually go to the place where you placed your lockbox and access the lockbox, it will disappear. Their reasoning behind this, so the map won’t be littered with lockboxes; makes very much sense in public servers, but remember I had these on my own private server, 6-10 people max. Anyhow, I found this out the hard way, not through ingame instructions or easily found on their forum, but after 1600 ingame hours later.I submitted the following ticket to get some help (I just about laughed myself to tears when I got their answer three days later) can anyone say automated?:My request ticketFeb 15 23:15""I came back into the game today after a months hiatus, I checked my private server's expiration time and I had 11 days left. So I just dropped another $50 to renew for another month in fear that I would lose my lockboxes and so that my wife could continue playing as well (we only PVE on this game).Anyhow, my heart dropped when I found all my lockboxes gone filled with my gear and survival items I've gathered over time for RPG'ng with my family (yes they have accounts and we play together on private). I really don't know what to do with this game, I had over 21 lockboxes distributed with my wife's, and rpg accounts. I only have two left. I have spent some considerable money on these and I don't care about the items in them, but I would like the boxes back, please help!""Their answerScarlet (Infestation Survivor Support)Feb 18 17:01""Hello Survivor,Thank you for contacting Infestation customer support!For lockbox issues, please ensure that you are on the correct server and location that you have placed your lockbox. When a lockbox is placed, it can only be accessed from the specific server it is placed on. We recommend always writing a note for yourself detailing the server and location you have placed a lockbox, as well as the password, as it is the responsibility of each player to keep track of their lockbox and password. Additionally, please keep in mind that lockboxes will despawn after three weeks if items are not taken from or added to the lockbox.Please also be aware that recently particularly crafty players have taken up safe-cracking to get at the loot stored inside, so you will want to make sure to select more difficult passwords and transport your favorite items to your GI for safe keeping!While you will not be receiving any reimbursement regarding this issue, we do apologize for the inconvenience and want to let you know that fortunately all items can be found in-game.Also, you can check out our forums(http://forums.infestationmmo.com/)for tips on finding items you may have lost, as well as our Twitter Page(https://twitter.com/infestationmmo)and our Facebook page(https://www.facebook.com/Infestationmmo)for future promotions and giveaways.We hope you have found this helpful and if you have any additional questions, please feel free to submit a new ticket and we will get back to you as soon as possible.Sincerely,Infestation Customer Support""In conclusion, if you want to throw your money at someone with terrible customer service, I totally recommend this game!"

,Recommended,226700,9932497,"Posted: 25 April, 2014",all,Wolfvuki,"This game is only recommended if you are willing to demote time to it, if not don't bother buying it. It's not the worse game, but certainly not the best. I recommend learning from youtube and experienced players on Twitch.tv as this game doesn't have a tutorial for new players which is one of the worse things I've found. Hackers are not much of an issue as hacks are getting detected faster, compared to earlier versions. The developers are still adding more stuff to this game and modifying it every few weeks to provide a better experience for players which varies from stat changing of items and adding new things in such as Super Zombies (beware) that are a lot stronger but drop loot such as rare assault rifles and sniper rifles. Due to the recent price change, it's more reasonable to get this decent quality game at such a low price. This game is mainly PvP based aswell, very few private servers provide PvE with enforcement of the rule, which isn't necessarily a bad thing but makes somethings a lot easier and more fun so it's best to travel in a group (only with friends, as randoms will just get your location and kill you)Pros:-Multiple spawn points to prevent risk of spawn killing along with spawn protection-Looting for meds, food, or weapons is easier than before-Vehicles have been added for faster transportation-Large map to get loot and stay away from players-Variety of servers for players who perfer small servers or very populated ones-Safe zones are found throughout the map to allow players to store items and prevent loss of them-Zombies can drop up to $10,000 (very rare) but they drop $25-$50 almost every drop, which can be used in the store at safe zones and can be farmed very easily-Developers have made a youtube page to help out players with tips (players have some too)Cons:-Hackers are commonly found on official servers-Good weapons are found at places with super zombies or cities with mass pvp-Super Zombies are nearly impossible to kill if you're new (they die easily from semi-auto shotguns)-Vehicles are destroyed easily as physics don't include a form of suspension (roads lead to cities but none of them can be drove through as vehicles and other debris that prevent you from going through them)-Players have a 95 percent chance of killing you if you encounter them (there are ways of getting out of these situations)-It's very hard to start from scratch if you're new to this game (recommend playing in a group)-Players in vehicles can instantly kill you if you're not in a safezone7/10"

,Not Recommended,226700,30108728,Posted: 22 February,all,Volt,"WarningI rewrote this after my intial review was missing. Prob due to the game changing names again. This game comes in many foul flavors such as WarZ, Infestation Surviver Stories (now classic wtf?), Romero's Aftermath (because WarZ/ISS was so bad lets do it again with less microtransactions), Infestation World (we couldn't even this this on Steam), Infestation The New Z (same game with improved business model), Shattered Skies (same game but in a space theme and no micro transactions), Last Man Standing (poor copy H1Z1 KotK and The Culling). All of these unfinished games use many of the same assets, and are on the same graphically handicapped engine. Some of the titles are almost exactly the same game.  Expect game breaking bugs, hackers, bad graphics, and poor performance.Pay MeThe game has the absolute worst micro transactions I have ever seen in a game. Pay real money to respawn... F*%@ no! Buy cosmetic items with real money just to be looted and taken by other players... WTF? Buy weapons and ammo with real money to kill the spawn camper when you pay me real money to respawn... Get the picture?  The last two titles (Shattered Skies and Last Man Standing) at least have done away with the micro transactions for the moment.ConclusionBe cautious of anything these guys develope/produce: OP Productions and Free Reign Entertainment, both companies founded by Sergey Titov, a man credited for making one of the worst games ever, Big Rigs: Over the Road Racing (2003).http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=869995119http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=527631789Plague ListWarZ  (Dec 2012)Infestation Serviver Stories  (June 2013)Romero's Aftermath  (Sept 2015)Infestation World  (April 2016)Shattered Skies  (July 2016)Infestation The New Z  (Nov 2016)Last Man Standing  (Dec 2016)"

I almost didnt buy the game because of negative reviews but i am glad it didnt stop me. The game is really quite fun and very populated. Yes it does have an ingame cash shop but its kind of ironic in that people go spend a bunch of money and you kill them with a pistol you found and take it all.This was the first DayZ clone (that i know of) The first clone games always get a bad rep, and with a popular negative video review on top of that it just makes people get off on putting down on this game.

Unfortunately this game has plenty of room for improvement.The biggest issue lies in the PvP system. While the addition of a PvP system does improve the realistic feel of the game, making it more like AMC's ""The Walking Dead"", the lack of any kind of radar or threat detection system makes detecting potential threats impossible. Making a seperate server list that allows for players who are new to the game to learn the play-style and get their basics down would vastly improve gameplay.The inventory/store system could be described as the worst in gameing, period. Lets start with the general store, the items are hideously overpriced. (an example being a candy bar, which is a beginer item and critical to survival, costs over $300. This doesn't seem like much untill you look at the average amount of money droped by zombies in game. This amount ranges from ~ $24 to $57 and on top of that the ratio for a money drop is about 1 in 3 (possibly less) This means that in order to afford even the most basic of items a player must grind for hours, possibly days (a process that gets real old real fast). In addition to scarce money drops and expensive items the general store lacks any kind of item selling which just makes getting enough money to buy what you need to survive even harder and un-apealing.Next is the inventory system. Which is pretty basic with quick slots for food and medkits, dedicated primary and secondary weapon paces and backpacks of different sizes allowing for more carrying space. There is nothing wrong with this sytem. The issue lies in what occurs when a player is defeated. Upon death ALL carried items are lost equiped or not. This means that you could've spent hours gathering items and if you die at any point you will lose all your items with an extreemly low chance of getting them back. This penalty is coupled with a 16 minute respawn time per character (unless you are willing to spend real money for an imediate revive)."

,Recommended,226700,10940362,"Posted: 29 June, 2014",all,Craze,"Honestly, I have had infestation for so long since beta days, but today I decide to buy one on steam.Why?My account got locked due to suspicious activity just because I had dynamic IP... what kind of game does that and just gives frustration to people. I was just trying out their new map release called caliwood, got timeout while joining the game, thought it was the problem of my connection since sometimes it has port problems, & resetted my modem. You have to reset your password and access your e-mail and keep changing your password over again and again. As for my case, the account was given to me by a old time friend online who I don't happen to have contact any longer, I placed a ticket support, actually had to wait 5 DAYS to get my ticket processed, wait 1 DAY for them to reply, then the next thing I checked, they closed my ticket and just said they couldn't do anything for me and just contacting my friend would be the only way. Didn't even care to help or give a chance. I had the ISS e-mail for the account, the serial key, the password that was made before I did reset password, and if anything, they could even back track all of the IP that was used most of the time coming from my country. I even had the e-mail receipt forwarded to me when he gave me the account. But no, they aren't helpful, they want you to just go buy another one, don't care if you don't get your account back, don't care how much items you have, how much gc you have, how much skills you have on the character. You also can't change the e-mail, which just gives more inconvenience.This is how infestation's service is, slow, unfriendly.Asides from that, the problems you may be encountering on the game sometimes (when the game staff aren't doing the right job) is having timeout when joining servers... it could happen for a short period of time, or for as long as it can go because they take so long to fix it or find the issue. Also, I think there are still hackers on the game, eversince beginning of beta which they always can't work it out... which is sad. It's better if you join groups on forums and be on their server instead, whether it be PVP or PVE or both.Now one reason why I still bought the game, after all the inconvenience they have brought me, is because my friends actually have it. I was the one who encouraged them to get it because the gameplay of the game is awesome. It has different type of zombies which you need to be cautioned about in fighting melee or gun wise. Numerous selection of melee / weapons. You have EXP to upgrade your skills for a better character. You need food, water, medical supplies (for when you are bleeding (need bandage for that), infected (need vaccine for that), or low on health (bandage or painkillers)), their towns / cities / barns are infested with zombies and if you know the right way of hitting them with melee, it can be a easy way for exp gaining and possible game money drops (you can only get that from killing zombies). They also have a few amount of blueprints to craft some special items but you'll have to find the materials around the map. They'll have a map on the game to guide you where you are and also where your team / clan members are, the graphics are awesome as well. They have a group system once you are on the game, you can talk on global, group, nearby chat, you can report whenever someone is hacking directly to Infestation (don't know how effective that is though). They also have a harvesting equipment which doesn't do much yet but still requires for crafting some of the blueprints, and also, the only way to put your items to a safe place would be on safezones, and there are 4 (i think) on the current map in colorado that has a vault place where you can put everything safely and use it anywhere on any server you please.So pretty much all you do is go out, grab goodies, survive, maybe do PVP, get exp, get game money, scavenge for the best melee / guns around or collect what you don't have yet. Save them over on the safezones (where there is no killing allowed) and store your posessions. If you get killed, you will lose everything on the ground, including your bag. There is about a 10 minute cooldown, if you have any character close by you can go and run for it and grab them back. Once you die as well, you can't use that character for 18 minutes, by then you can revive it back. If you want it to be revived instantly, you'll have to spend GC (gold coins - real money) Anyway, the game idea is great, you won't get bored of it because you'll have to be constantly aware of your surroundings, its a unique one of a kind game. They only have two maps (colorado, caliwood as well but still on public testing) they aren't small, they are huge and another mode called stronghold, and different servers, for veterans, official servers, private severs, etc.I'm just going to recommend this as a yes, just because the metascore is awfully low which is weird, but ... yeah, i love the game, but not the staff. Hope this info helps you guys know a lot more about the game and decide if you want to buy it or not.PS. The photos and videos graphic quality is exactly like how it is on the game. It's not like those other type of games who tries to make their trailer or photos look good but actually look crappy on game."

Even more so now iv'e played it.It is terrible. Apalling, I heard that the developers fixed many of the bugs and glitches but this is so sincerely not true.  After my first character died i made another to try to gain some fun out of the game and it would not allow me. I assume this is not a bug but still after one day it wont let me make a new one. (by this, I mean i cannot start a new character) It's completely broken in every way. The only good thing is the soundtrack which is not even that good, But literally this is the only good thing i can think of. The graphics are ugly even on max and you have a disadvantage. if you run your graphics any higher then medium, the blindingly annoying sun rays fill your screen. So you HAVE to run it on low anyways. They keep adding pure Sh*t without actually fixing the game. Wow. I have never hated the game this much.Every player seems to have extreme anger issues and want to drink to blood from your still pumping veins, or mash you into pulp and feed their family.

Infestation should remove PvP only because the hackers rule the PvP servers. 75% of the people I've fought in this game were hacking and no, this is not me complaing because I got killed and lost my stuff,  this is because I get killed by a guy/girl who super jumps onto the Post Office,  jumps off the roof, no-clips behind it into the back room and kills me and many others. But, my personal favorite experience with hackers was a speed hacker running around auto meleeing me! It was a blast getting killed over and over by hackers! Another reason I don't recommend this amazing game is for the lack of effort being put into it. Hammerpoint decides to make a new game because they relaized this game is to broken to fix! If they would have done something about the hacking situtation when it first started, maybe it could have been fixed! But nope! Hammerpoint just wanted those hackers to keep hacking so when they were banned, they made another $5 or $15 according to when you bought this game. Maybe sometime in the future, Hammerpoint will decide that maybe they should try and fix WarZ, but I'm guessing that won't happen. So, unless you like getting killed by hackers and you like games that were forgotten about and left to rot, I suggest not buying Infestation: Surivior Stories."

,Not Recommended,226700,14024318,"Posted: 16 January, 2015",all,xesty,"I've been a part of Infestation: Survivor Stories almost near launch and have been through so much. It has gotten better and my review is going to be on what I feel about it now.Basically, the game is alright. It's fun to play and it has a great concept but as usual, the dev's can't keep up with the hype. The game has been infested with Brazillians which I find extremely annoying considering there is no region-lock and the majority of players on U.S. SERVERS are Brazillians. Next, cheating was a major problem and seems like it still is. This game is bound for cheaters and with broken punkbuster + crappy FairFight, it seems like this problem will never end. These are 2 major reasons I am not into this game anymore.As for the game itself, the graphics are alright but come with horrible optimzation. You need a high-end PC to run the game smooth with 50-60fps on high let alone ultra. Grass looks terrible as well as a lot of scenery which is 2D. Animations are pretty bad and are still buggy. Guns look great though and perform how they should although all items have a durability which is annoying considering how fast things break. I will never complain about hitreg or spread or bullet drop cause this game could be considered a simulator with that stuff. Dev's go back and forth changing loot systems but right now they are perfect. They also change how zombies attack/register hits and right now they are good as well.Dev team is alright but some of them (the ones that stream) really need to GTFO cause they are stubborn and treat their own community like crap ignoring most of the problems people want solved. Otherwise really slow progress on the game including map development and new concepts. I am not surprised though. If only this game was not led by SERGEY TITOV (just look at Big Rigs) who almost ran this game to the ground for the first 6 months of it's existence. Overall dev team is unprofessional considering all the flaws you see in the game graphically and physically.To conclude TL;DR - Game is around a 5-6/10 for the experience and feel you get when hunting/getting hunted AND ONLY that. Otherwise graphics are pretty bad, optimzation is bad, dev's are slow and lazy, animations and functions in game are bad, guns are good, shooting is good, CHEATERS ARE THE MAJORITY, too many annoying Brazilians, and that's it. Only reccommend this game if you are REALLY into zombie stuff and can live past getting wrecked by mostly cheaters while having BRs scream over chat/voice."

I will never buy another game from this hack of a so called development group.

You may get into a legit battle and be victorious, but will just get aimbotted before you can loot the fallen enemies items. It's a great concept and has a lot of cool things to do while playing, but the hacker PvP is it's downfall for me.You want to work hard looting, work hard PvPing, work hard for your gear/guns/loot to just get killed by a hacker and lose it all?

The atmosphere within the game is amazing. It's one thing fighting the zombie hoards (who in the beginning were much easier to deal with) but the human element made the game much more of a challenge.Then the hackers...You see, you need to spend real money to be able to survive on the game and I haven't got a problem with that but when someone is able to camp outside a safe zone and blow you and items that you've paid real money for to pieces then that's a different story. The developers should be taking responsibility for this but nothing happended. In the end, I'd had enough. Hacks are available that allow you to see where others are within the game. That's all I wanted, just to be able to see and avoid the thugs and thieves and to be able to go about doing my own thing. Obviously I wasn't as shrewd as some and I got banned - no big deal, I got what I deserved. Would I like to be given a second chance, based on having spent over $50 dollars buying DLC and credits? Yes. Would I accept that second chance with the game being as flawed as it currently is? Not really.In short, the game is great but terribly flawed. Fix the flaws and you have an amazing environment.

While fighting a zombie, you'll keep hittin' him, take a step back, wait for him to make some random ""attack"" animations while staying on the same spot, then you step foward and hit him again. That's how melee seems to work here. The zombie will just stay there, doing almost nothing.The grapichs are ugly as hell. The textures are bad and the dev seems to put minimal effort into it. I won't talk more about it, just see for yourself:http://imgur.com/a/pVkOq(You can see how lazy the devs are by looking at the 6 and 7th picture... they just ctrl+c/v the door texture)The level design doesn't seem so bad, but all the buildings and houses I entered were empty, there was just the loot on the floor, nothing else.I can't say much about the audio, besides the fact that when jumping, you'll make an weird noise, and the zombie grunts just randomly bugs sometimes.I haven't had much experience with the guns, but I didn't see any problems with them.Overall, I'll give this game a 2/10."

I know some people will defend this game say all kinds of things they love the game and want others to join thats great. but $15 get the game i know it's cheap but i just don't even see how it's worth $5 i'd consider it at $1 and would play it occasionally maybe if it was free.(Loot review):- In my opinion the games not that bad, it's just not the feel of a zombie apacalypse survival game it's like a high graphics battlefield with less features in my opinion. The zombies are more of an annoyance than anything they sometimes run at you sometimes leap at you and sometimes walk towards you fast. But this game is not really survival it's who can gather the best weapons the fastest and who has the best gear, some weapons can't really kill for example the new harvesting tool cannot kill anything and in my experiance the uzi silenced can't kill any characters it drops zombies alright but not players. Also everyone has a gun litterly everyone. if you don't have a gun in this game u havn't looked anywhere yet. Guns are very common in my time i already have 3 g36cs 7 akms 8 anacondas 12 shotguns 1 m4 1 honey badger.(CUSTOMIZATION REVIEW):- ALSO the game does not give you a complete experience of customization like dayz does, you can only customization you really have are the vest, helmet/mask- you can however change how your character has clothes there arn't that many choices to choose from sweats, jeans, cargos, and dress pants or something thats really it not that much costumization to it.(GAME FEATURES REVIEW):i havn't played long enough to really give that great of a review but so far i don't like the game if you like pvp mostly and things distracting you while ur trying to kill the guy killing you then you might like the game. But i highly doubt it even for $15 i wish i didn't get this game and i also put another $15 to get armor and large supplies early there is a market you can buy ammo food medical and masks but they don't really help that much ( YOU CANNOT BUY GUNS). You also have xp to level up your stealth your ability to heal your ablility to eat( yeah i know lol) your endurance and how well you can shoot a gun and how much damage you do with melee. You do get hungry and dehydrate and u can bleed out and others stuff like that but not even close to dayz, dayz is worth the extra money even in alpha. This game i do not recommend(Gameplay review):- my friend said he loves the game played 15 hrs i guess but in my opinion it's not that great of a game, the servers are all pvpers really nobody wants to be friends. It's a shoot on sight game, (SOUNDS EXCITING?) well let me change that for the fast pace players. people will stay in same spot sniping everytime you take a step and they are all sneak attacks when close range. don't fall for their tricks watch them stalk them, now your probably imagining yourself sniping people and sneaking up to them and shooting them in the back or something, well unless you level up. You spawn randomly just like dayz these spawns are a lot more safe you do not ever really spawn near anyone ever and when you spawn you have about 5 secs of invinciblity. there are safe zones where u can store you loot but people/clans/groups camp those safespots. there is vehicles in the game like 2 but you have to repair them none of them are operational. no air vehicles. people will try to trick you ask you to join their group don't do it. all that does is give away where you are at.  Your player doesn't walk silently he stomps his feet when walking. and crouching he sounds like a regular person walking, running he sounds normal the walking is just way to loud zombies hear you instantly.- zombies:now the zombies are  alright they leap at you run at you walk to you punch you i guess, they sometimes sleep so any zombie you see on the ground it's probably asleep and will wake up when u get close u can't sneak up to it and hit it, it will hear you and it will come after you. They are very easy to beat alone but in numbers they can challenging but they mainly just hurt you when u are going after players.- weapons:now the weapons you can add attachments and again they're all easy to find there really isn't that much to tell you about the weapons some of them are zombie killers some of them are player killers attachments are weird you can't put a smg grip on a smg u have to put a different grip on it and one grip fits all i guess. (carful on what you buy u can't sell anything but you can trade with other players on the way but they have to be your friends because again shoot on sight kind of game. But back to attatchments they stay in your inventory and others can't see your attachments they don't equip to your gun and stay on it every time u unequip the gun you have to put the attachments back on the gun so it's not really building your gun loadout it's more like changing clothes putting some on once in awhile and then changing. they don't stay on and friends can't see what attachments you have on and they take up space in your inventory even when they are equipped.-pvp:player vs player some guns drop 1 shot some drop in 100 shots some just don't kill. i've tested a couple weapons and i have to say they arn't that great it feels like call of duty core hit markers no bleeding and they just keep going. my friend shot me in the neck with a smg 1 shot i took barley any damage then i shot him with a smg he took some damage not that noticably though. But this game does have a feel of pvp, thats all people do everyone is paranoid of each other and shoots on sight people will argue that you shouldn't trust people that great but a community of gamers that don't help each other and steal and kill each other 24/7 because there really isn't that much communication in this game. clans travel in packs and will kill almost anyone people will try to lure you to them try to trick you to kill you for a bag of nuts of something. if you like camping for 2-3hrs waiting for someone and then engaging them while also surviving then you might like this game. there is also smaller maps for just pvp but those are not that fun they are really boring.-pve:now the player vs environment this includes zombies and elements. There is no weather it's night and morning, zombies are again annoying elements dehydrate and hungry is not that bad but considering when you get punched by a zombie and your bleeding out and you can't run because of this it can get annoying.- crafting:it's okay not that much you can build, some knives on brooms, non-mobile riotshields, little mini walls. stuff like that.- finding friends:( note: if you die u have to wait to revive 15mins, and u spawn in a new place.)now if your going to try to find in game friends you have a 20% chance of finding a friend maybe less. now if your playing with your real life friends well then yeah play with them. BUT remember you spawn randomly sometimes you have to switch through characters you can create up to 5 characters all have different xp and different names but yeah. Find friends can be hard sometimes traveling alone dehydrated and hungry while getting shot at by other players it's hard. finding your friend can take awhile you can't spawn near them it won't let you unless you are at a safe spot. when you guys group up u guys can see where the other guy is at on the map and it'll show you a little thing where the guy is so you can go to it but you can be far away.wish i could say more but max txt."

The map is nice and has very emersive citys. However, when I first bought the game I was told that it was a scam and a bad game. After the people said that I gifted the game to them and allowed them to play it. I only had 3 copys and one of my freinds bought it. After playing for about an hour, my freinds changed there minds about the game. Only one feind had an issue with the game and that was because he had a glitch with the launcher. I have spent 32 hours playing the game and I still do not know all the places on the map. The game itself runs great as well. Also the loot system is really good and also ammo and guns are hard to come by. For the people who are reading this and saying to themselves ""Well you can just buy the guns and it pay to win"" I thought the same thing befour I actuly played it. It is not by any means play to win, also you cant buy guns, you can only get ammo, food, gear, ect... It is also at a very good price right now on steam and I think it is definitly worth the money. BEWARE: Some things may seem good in the game and nice, but some games change things that are not broken over time, this has happend to many zombie games and mods(you know the mod). Also the anti hack is very good on the servers so you dont have to worry about hackers. A final tip I can give you the reader is that when in citys watch out for players. Overall I think this game needs to be re-revieed and have a higher metascore than 20."

This would have been imo a great single or coop game if a few big bugs were fixed one of them would be being able to climb onto anything and become invincible to zombies.This game had huge potential and unfortunately it could not deliver.

Some even tried to intimidate behind the walls making sure to make plenty of noise in an attempt to make me come out to attack.They try there best to not be obvious given the nature of how FairFight detects and bans. I did try and record this behavior but I couldn't seem to get it to work while the cheats are active it would only cause a d3d9 error.So people will have to just take my word for it, or go see for yourself if you have got to the point where you think this game is a waste of time. This company has no interest in IP/System banning these guys, it would be bad for business which is why most ban waves happen prior to a sale.Cheaters are their biggest customers.It's a shame because this has slowly grown in a decent game, but the plague of cheaters that infests makes it unplayable unless you're willing to hack to even the field which is just totally pointless..."

Buy if you like to subject yourself to grief with a friend (it makes it all the better)THE LONG REVIEW:I had approached Infestation: Survivor Stories as your typical DayZ survival game (having not played the game at the time) I had thought that this was going to be a more arcadey version of it. I was completely wrong in every single aspect. Unfortunately writing this review has been the most interesting part about this game because there was nothing engaging about it.The game was cheap, I was tempted, so I bought the game thinking it was going to be similar to DayZ. Alas I was wrong, this was one of my worst purchases ever...and I regret buying this game for 5+ of my friends on Steam.Infestation is littered with problems, pay-to-win weapons, terrible framerate, unholy optimization and long wait times that had me quitting the game frequently. I am quite thankful I had bought DayZ later on down the line because if I had hadn't then I would've hated the zombie survival genre.Infestation did (at least) include it's fair share of zombies, which I can admit that I enjoyed because DayZ seems to lack that. However it doesn't make up for the fact that there are some awful players who are inmature, and constantly yell obscentities at each other (I was in one of ""those servers""). The other thing that was bothersome was that I would get sniped from far off in the distance by pay-to-win weapons, and yes they are pay-to-win because I literally can't fend for myself against them. But wait! There's more! You can lose these pay-to-win weapons as well, so if your killed, your practically screwed unless you find out who killed you or where you dropped your stuff. These weapons weren't balanced...like at all.Another bothersome thing I found was how many sections there were to pay for things. There was so many barriers it could practically be it's own game, just call it Infestation: Microtransaction Management. I'm serious you could buy tokens to spawn back in the game quicker, if that doesn't infurate you then by all means...try this game and discover the wonders of microtransactions.The change in name isn't really a change at all, it's more of a ""hey we know you hated our previous game, but we want you to think differently of this ""new"" title instead"". There was terrible physics, dumb AI (no not like in Halo, they were dumb as rocks), and a community of innmature players. If you want fun help me kickstart a journey to Chernobyl where I'm sure we can forge our own survival adventure game there.If you truly wish to buy this game, buy it for someone you dislike because they will be utterly dissapointed and frustrated.MADE FOR: People who actually buy into this kind of crap, folks who want to torment others with bad gifts, and young adolescents who love to use the word ""gay"" and yell at internet strangers. It's also good for People with plenty of money to burn just to see noobs like me get rekt.NOT MADE FOR: People who want a cheaper alternative to DayZ. I also recommend getting your common sense, conscious and brain removed before purchase.INFESTATION: SURVIVOR STORIES2.5/10"

But I still feel the need to tell people exactly how insultingly bad this game is.Well, first of all, the company itself, Hemmerpoint Interactive. In the making, renaming, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ting and general ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥gery concerning this game, they managed to be so corrupt I almost respect them for it. It takes some real stones to be THAT dishonest to THAT MANY people.Now, the game itself. The graphics are nothing special, and require way more CPU power to run than they should. This is due to a total lack of optimization that's present throughout this whole game.The loot spawns are stupidly overpowered, with any player being able to find an assault rifle in a matter of minutes. This means that the zombies are hardly a threat, unless you do something incredibly stupid. So, pvp combat is the main threat to you in this game. However, over half of the playerbase are hackers, so odds are you're screwed.In conclusion, this game is repetative, enraging, and generally not worth playing. The company that made it doesn't deserve your respect, let alone your money.  DO. NOT. BUY. THIS. GAME.P.S. There is an early access game called The Dead Linger. Its in alpha, but already is far better than this, and it's going to be amazing. I cant recommend it enough.P.P.S. Microtransactions in a survival game? Really, Hammerpoint? Really??"

,Recommended,226700,9535485,"Posted: 17 March, 2014",all,J Claine,"THIS IS AN HONEST REVIEW.I just bought this when it was on sale the other day for a dollar. I figured, why the hell not. Because I watched people play it, and it looks good. Not to mention, PEOPLE STILL PLAY IT. In 100% honesty, this game is not nearly as horrible as everyone says it is. Yes, it seems cheap and broken or whatever. But it hardly is from what I've played. Sure it isn't very original but I have a hard time seeing what makes this game worse than Takedown: Red Sabre.When compared to DayZ, yes this game looks like total garbage. That's because, and you might want to sit down for this, THEY'RE TWO DIFFERENT GAMES! DayZ, or as many people like to call it currently Hiking Simulator 2014, is fantastic. It's creepy and stealthy and really wants you to focus on your game. However, currently I do not feel like running and walking absolutely everywhere, spending a good half hour to maybe even an hour just getting to one place. That place, I then find out has absolutely nothing I want. This is why I currently stick to playing the mod for ARMA 2. I'm aware DayZ is in alpha, so don't chop my nuts off. I'm just saying, the game is very time consuming with little reward regardless of how much we love it.However this is where Infestation comes in. This game was pegged by many to be a simple cash grab, nothing more nothing less. But to be honest, I find it pretty fun. Yeah ok the map is smaller and there's not enough whatever the fuzz who-ha that DayZ has. But it has it's own stuff. In-game currency for buying items at NPC stores in safezones (3 things DayZ does not have), a variety of different weapons (melee, firearms both), a few clothing varieties and flashy bags, as well as ones that upgrade your backpack space, and the basic needs of food and water. While this game might just seem like a dumbed down DayZ, it isn't. The zombies pose a small threat when they're by themselves, but will tear you to pieces in groups. That being the only way I've died so far, I should learn to be stealthy. And yes, the stealth works! You can find attachments for your guns, set up little barricades, barbed wire, chemlights and all that good stuff. Oh and vehicles too, so no walking for 3 hours if you can spot yourself one!Onto the tech problems that people complain about. The main problem people seem to have with this game is the amount of hackers. Well I've nary seen 1. That's right, over a couple different servers, I haven't seen one hacker destroy my fun. But what I do see is the abundance of chat messages on the left side of the screen, notifying the server that the anti-cheat ""FairFight"" has just banned a player for hacking. So yeah okay, there might BE hackers, but they don't hang around for long. I haven't crossed paths with one yet, and I've played on a few busy servers. (Also, I don't lag on them! Holy jesus!)Problem number 2 is that people complain about the game crashing. Well mine hasnt, and I've done my fair share of starting it up. I play until I quit out of it manually, not once have I had to look up a fix or anything like that. It works, who knew.Another thing people whine about is ""YOU HAVE TO PAY REAL MONEY TO RESPAWN! THIS GAME SUCKS!"". Well you don't. That is, you don't HAVE to. If you have a special bony for a character you made (notice: you get 5 character slots and I'm pretty sure characters don't level up or anything), then by all means go ahead and pay money instead of waiting a meer 18 minutes to play with him/her again. But if that little♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥doesn't shine for anyone in particular, then simply make a new character to play with until your 18 minutes passes! Then you can go to the menu, revive for FREE, and play with that person once your 2nd character dies. Who cares about alternating between two flat characters? Not me, just let me freaking play. (Which they do)All in all, this game is a faster paced DayZ. The quality is lower but the game stands still for it's own setup. It's not crappily optimized like the ARMA 2 engine (which needs SO MUCH polishing before I can truly love my DayZ), and it has traditional FPS feels to it. The camera is like your camera in most FPS games (BF, COD, Halo, what have you), it isn't glued to a wonky player model but rather the classic and a little more preferable floating camera.tl;drThe game is not a 1/10. It's more so a 7-8/10 from me. If you like DayZ but you want more action, more danger, or better playability with your PC, then here's for you. 15 for this game is a little much still, it should be around 10. Pick it up when it's cheap on sale, like it or don't, but don't listen to everyone who says it's God's true mistake. Infestation will entertain you until DayZ reaches the point of greatness it's supposed to be at."

I've read the bad reviews and I can't agree with a lot of it. Were the devs pretty sketchy about some stuff? Yes. Were there unreleased features in the beginning? Yes. Is the game itself bad? No. Personally when I jumped into the game the only thing I was thinking about was not getting shot or eaten, not about the extra features that weren't added. You're dropped in, you sneak around Colorado, you see a town, you loot said town, you kill some zombies and then someone kills you. What? Someone kills you? Yes. This is a post-outbreak scenario where everyone is a target. I've killed other people and they've killed me. It's a vicious circle but each death only drove me further to acquire gear and find ways to not get my head blown off.""IT'S ALL HACKERS!"" - I have yet to encounter any hackers. I don't deny that people can and will hack a game, but it's not as if the entirety of the server is hackers. Hackers are a part of every game and it's not entirely fair to blame this one in particular.""THE AI IS TERRIBLE!"" - I've seen terrible AI and this isn't half-bad for a game I payed 3 dollars for. The zombies detect you based on how fast and openly you move. They run at you and you hit them until they die. There's a glitch in Battlefield 4 where your teammates just stand there while you're shot.""THE DEVS LIED!"" - Yes and no. I'm not really a fan of the incessant banning at the beginning, but the unadded stuff could've been avoided by simply saying ""Coming soon!"" or ""Alpha version!"" Simple labeling hiccup but not enough to detract from my personal experience. You can go onto forums and read angry hate threads all you want, but I'm actually playing the game and I haven't even explored the full map that they actually started with.""IT'S A COPY OF DAYZ!"" - And every fantasy movie is a copy of Lord of the Rings, and every MMORPG is copying World of Warcraft. Just because the game contains zombies in an open-world setting doesn't make it a clone of DayZ. Were the developers trying to possibly gain some of the same success? Possibly, but I'm personally a bigger fan of this game. The games feel totally different to me.""IT LOOKS SO CRAPPY!"" - Well now I KNOW you've never played the game because it's beautiful.Overall this game is 5 dollars. 5 DOLLARS. Would I pay 60 for it? Nah, but for the cheap pricetag I'm not regretting anything about my purchase."
,Recommended,226700,9565131,"Posted: 19 March, 2014",all,Raiseo Hitsu,"Okay so the game has horrible reviews and reputation, granted.Then a friend bugged me about buying it, it was 1,29 Euros so I said : ""Ehh why not, at least I can see for myself what the hate is all about"". It seems the developer team got a revamp too, so it could actually turn out pretty well.The game is actually pretty fun, had an awesome time in it, sure there are some downfalls, the occasional bug and the in-game currency, but you know what? I had a great time so far (13 Hours atm).So let's get to it.Infestation: Survivor Stories (aka War Z) is a sandbox survival game, you roam a big map trying to survive from your bodily needs, zombies and worst of all, other players. A lot of people say it's a clone to Day Z, well, I played the mod and I saw quite a lot of videos of the standalone, let's try to compare them, shall we? Most of these go according to taste.Infestation vs Day Z.Let's start with the good stuff :+ Clear HUD, you always know what's going on with your body.+ Much cheaper 1,29 (90% discount) vs 24,99 (no discount).+ Interesting map (personal taste)+ Experience and skills that give a feel of progression+ Most in-game cash items are bullets, melee weapons and other stuff, nothing game breaking or unfindable.+ Much more complete, vehicles, no invisible or bugged zombies.+ Stronghold mode where you can build stuff and pvp in small maps.+ Missions you can complete for extra exp+ Much more fluidNow for the worse stuff, where Day Z excels :- You cannot force feed people.- You cannot handcuff people.- You customize your char at start and that's it, you don't find clothes, nor you  can rip your clothes.- Day Z has probably more items.- The map is probably bigger?- More hardcore, you can break your legs, go unconscious because you lost blood.- Better graphicsNeutral stuff :*Infestation has safe zones (2% of the map but still)*Zombies are limited to zones it seems, they don't follow you outside of towns, while in Day Z they have no limit.*You can drop money from zombies that you can trade in for bullets, food, or other stuff.All in all? It was a pleasant surprise. If you have a Day Z itch but don't have much money like me, take this one, you won't regret it, but it has to be played with friends, otherwise it may become a dull experience really fast."

Unless you wish to scavenge for hours and risk death and losing everything. You must purchase atleast ammunition if not firearms. most importantly theres no point to the game. After awhile of playing it quickly becomes apparent that you will be doing nothing but finding things then going to the next area. There isnt anything eles to do maybe fight hackers?

WHY THE ♥♥♥♥ DID I PAY 15 Euro FOR THIS♥♥♥♥♥♥???The only good thing in this game is its graphics.Everyone expects that paying 15 Euro for a game you will receive the full game right? WRONG!!! You will pay 15 Euros for a free to play like game full of microtransactions. Will come back to that in a moment!The map size is with mid. to small size BUT you have stamina that it will run off in null time and you constantly travel for hours from end of the map to the other... WALKING SLOWLY!!! And you will need to travel from the one end to the other NON STOP because the developer decides to put the weapons to the one end and the food and the water to the other. And oh boy you need to drink and eat A LOT.You can buy water from the ingame store ;) with in-game currency or with real money ;). Guess how much time you will need to play before you can collect enough in-game money to buy a single bottle of water. SEVERAL HOURS!!!! Most of the time, you are armed with a mele weapon like frying pans and meanwhile the boys which likes the pay to win style bought itself a sniper rifle with a lots of ammo clips (I did not find a single ammo clip on the map during my 20 hour play... just saying). Mele weapons! That is great right? You can splash some zombies heads some blood to be spilled. WRONG AGAIN!!! Except the issue with the snipers constantly camping there are zombies (as you expect) which can kill you with 3 hits. Guess what happens if you you got attacked by 2 zombies and you are with a mele weapon? 50% chance you will die 100% they will hit you. And if you got attacked by 3 you are dead. If you got hit and you bleed you are dead because the medkits are extremely rare and the bandages are  just rare. Of course you can buy them from.. the in-game shop ;)Lets go to the other part of the map. The one with the guns. It's an airfield full of zombies. In general to get there and take a weapon you will need to crouch for like an hour find a single weapon with only one clip in it. no, no not one spare clip! Only the bullets loaded in it. Of course you can buy spare ammo clips from... yes from the in-game shop (after 20 hours of gameplay I still do not have enough in-game money to buy one). Ok. Now... you have a gun with some bullets in it, you just need to get out of the airfield. It's the same way, around hordes of zombies, crouching on th airfield for an hour. Not to mention that this is ONE BIG OPEN SPACE (it's an AirField after all) and if someone want to kill you, you are sitting duck.The community is... let's say that everyone is shooting on side and screaming about your mother after that (90% of the time those are the guys that bought the sniper rifle in the beginning of the game). There is also a lot of Invitation spam. Random guys just offer you a party in order to find you and kill you. And they will try to invite you till you leave the game... every fOcking single game.If I need to give it a score it will be 2/10. And I'm not giving 1 point only because of the visuals."

Still the same bad spawn system that will sometimes spawn players on top of the others, weak zombies, some hackers, and the lack of things to do beyond loot/kill players/die/repeat, but it's the formula that made DayZ famous on the first place. Many guns around nowadays, not sure if that's good or not. Lots of fun to be had, especially if played with friends. Buy it when it's around U$10,00 or less."

Then this is the game for you!With all jokes aside, I bought this game for £1.09 on a sale and I regret every penny of it. After seeing the screenshots, I thought it might be a good investment to purchase a zombie survival type game on the cheap during a sale of some description. I attempted to play the game on multiple servers and every time I tried said servers the game 'disconnected' me. After a short time of trial and error, it finally connected me to a game with around 50 others players. Only one word came to mind whilst i played it: Disgraceful.To conclude, I would strongly reccomend anyone who (like me) considered to buy the game to invest in something other such as 'DayZ' or '7 Days to die'.

Zombies can also reach through walls/cars so ducking into the church in one of the towns is a death trap--another player and I got swarmed by 15 zombies, rifle & shotgun were useless, barely escaped out the window and up a hill & back to a safe zone.This game has turned into an awful ""Pay To Win"" product, they shrunk the number of public servers which made it easier for outlaws/thugs/hackers to camp with a sniper rifle at the non-random spawn points to steal from you and some players are stuck renting private servers to get loot before joining a public server to have any chance of survival. Creator/developers had tried to bring balance via decaying of weapons/gear but it made campers w/sniper rifles more common as a result. Lack of Player vs Environment public servers from the start is where this game failed the most, public servers mirror the ugly side of The Walking Dead... shoot first, pillage and ask questions later. Keep in mind since this game allows extra characters, outlaws/thugs can create/delete characters for farming/stealing loot which leads to distrust of ""clean status"" players on servers.Can't recommend this game, they've created more bugs with each update, performance is really geared towards Intel processors which makes AMD A8/10 setup less tempting for a home-theatre game box and pay to win factor has ruined any balance on public servers. There are clans who split the cost of a private server for PvE/Co-Op which dulls some pain for those of us who still try the game every so often but the zombie spawn/swarm AI and hit box bugs turn most Co-Op events into a Police Quest: SWAT style effort of trying to build containment/safe zones & wasting heaps of ammo in the process."

On the off-chance that the devs actually read this, let alone care, a good update to teh game would be PvZ servers (person versus zombie servers) this is where players can not kill eachother and you wont be killed on sight. in the early days i would give it a 8 out of ten just for minor bugs, but now the best i can say is a 5 out of 10.  if the devs honestly cared about their work they would fix the hacker problem before adding a ""new map"" that nobody gives two quacks about."

Anyone that has a negative review about Infestation clearly doesn't have anyone to play with, and constantly dies and loses their gear. The learning curve is a little steep, especially when it comes to PvP, but once you get the hang of it, the game is a blast, especially with friends. As to be expected with any MMO, there's always going to be loot grinding, and if that's not what you're into, this game probably isn't for you. All I have to say, is if you like zombies, and you like shooting/ stabbing/ blowing things up with friends, this game is definitely for you.For some reason, Steam doesn't recognize my actual play time, of approximately 150 hours."

I deside Mediocre Dancer 420 is quite a good name for the 'ex military' lumberjack-shirt gentleman i've created. Soon after, I press the quickjoin on the official servers.And then the game loads.and loads.and loads yet again.After a blisteringly fast 5 minute load time, Mediocre Dancer 420 starts his adventures out in the mountians, bringing along with him a flashlight, bandages , some pepsi and a granola bar that looks like it was stolen from a Walrmart. Mediocre then wanders out into the mountians, in search of an actual weapon; a car or something that'll make him a true mediocre dancer.Soon after Mediocre Dancer 420 sees an APC on the road. Being the peaceful ex-military type of person, Mediocre wants to avoid confronting this APC because it'll probably shoot him down because of his bad fashion style. I hide in a bush and wait for the APC to pass along. Within due time, the vehicle leaves and i'm back to wandering the mountians in search of fortune and glory.Following these events, Mediocre Dancer 420 finds a crashed plane in the woods near the mountian. ""Oh great!"" he says to  himself. With his mind full of excitement and wonder, he enters the plane.While he walks through the plane, a badly-modeled zombie thing stares Mediocre Dancer 420 down. Being the ex-military type, he knows that being a pacifist in these situations usually gets him killed and that he should swing the flashlight at the zombie until something happens.And so Mediocre Dancer 420 did.He swung and swung at the zombie for minutes straight, each hit making blood spurt out of the zombie like in any other thing. Using the advance tactics of circle strafing, the zombie is defeated and just lays on the ground looking quite upset with itself.Mediocre Dancer 420 then searched the plane, finding 2 bottles of Painkillers that look like they were just plastic with a blue label on it and a beer. He then sat there in deep thought for a minute, deciding that he will be the Max Payne of this world.Unfortunately for him, finding a pistol was harder than he expected. He searched for about 10 minutes straight then encountered a floating rifle with a backpack.Knowing his purpose, he danced interpetly at the person, waving his flashlight in signs of peace and order. The floating rifle and backpack seemed to understand these movements as ""I'm an idiot, please blow my brains out"". As the rifle fired at Mediocre Dancer 420, he started to fade in and out of the existence. Shots fired at him, only a few hit due to his cross-dimentional powers. Mediocre Dancer 420 knew this was his last stand, so he took a painkiller and swung his flashlight at the floating rifle and backpack.About a minute later, Mediocre Dancer 420 emerged victorious although he was bleeding out. Giving the corpse of his opposition a handshake, he collapsed and bled out.And thus ends the tale of Mediocre Dancer 420, a noble hero in a♥♥♥♥♥♥game."

,Not Recommended,226700,18385588,"Posted: 8 October, 2015",all,Zen,"About a year ago I was laying awake in my room, it was about 2:30 in the morning, and I got a call on my cell phone. I picked it up and saw that it was my ex girlfriend. Me being reluctant, I answered in hopes that she may have just butt dialed me or something. That's when it happened. The frantic screaming was so ear piercing I had to hold the phone away from my face for a solid minute before I could even ask her what was wrong. I simply said, calm down, speak slowly so I can understand you. So, short story is, she told me she was pregnant, and has been for six months, (Which was around the time we broke up) and that she didn't even know she was. In her defense she has always been a bigger type of girl, pretty, but big. She was screaming at me because she recently got together with a guy, who she loved very much, but didn't believe in abortion. Now she has to have a child from me, whom she hates, and be with this new guy, whom she loves, and she needs to decide if she's going to tell him, or keep it hidden until the baby is born. Me being a sympathetic guy, told her I was going to try and figure it out with her. She asked me to come over to talk it out, and so I did.It's literally 4 in the morning, I arrive at her house, and instead of her answering the door, it's her current boyfriend, with a real angry look on his face. Obviously I assume she told him, and just apologize right away, he invites me inside to talk, and there she is sitting at her computer in the living room. I walk in, and she stands up, and tells me she couldn't help but tell him, because she told him everything to begin with. She was crying her eyes out. He simply looked at me, put his hand on my shoulder, and said, ""Do you know what I do for a living?""Honestly, I had no idea, i just told him no hoping he would get to the point.He replied""I make video games. Video games for people like you. Even for people like her."" At this point in time he starts to raise his voice, she's still crying uncontrollably in the background.""VIDEO GAMES FOR PEOPLE LIKE THAT BABY BOY, WHO'S GOING TO GROW UP WITHOUT HIS TRUE FATHER, BECAUSE I'LL NEVER LET YOU SEE HIM ONCE HE'S BORN""I was pretty suprised/shocked, but me being a gamer, I couldn't help myself. I asked ""What games have you made?""that's when it happened. The sheer terror on both my and my ex's face.He responded ""Infestation:survivor stories""Well, long story moderately short, her and I both laughed histerically, she kicked him out of her house, I became a dad, we've never been happier. Occasionally he'll drive by her house and scream profanities from his honda civic, but he's harmless either way."

I never linked my steam account to my WarZ or Infestation account but i easily had around 700 hours on it. It used to be such a fun and really good game but then hackers started coming into the game and then it just kept growing. The amount of hackers that the game used to have was around 90% of the population. Some of them still werent good and my group of friends could usually outnumber them and I had tons of fun on the game but then the hackers just kept coming and eventually it wasnt even fun anymore because almost everyone on the server was hacking. Then i put the games on steam that had a bunch of in game currency on them so i bought around 4 of them and spent it all on in game items so i had a bunch of accounts that i just ended up giving away and then i even gave away my main account cuz it wasnt fun anymore. If they re-release the game and get a real Anti-Cheat system then this would easily become my favorite game again. The PvP was so fun because you had consequences if you died, you would lose EVERYTHING in your inventory all the guns you got and everything. Thats something that i like because you wouldnt run out of guns and armor if you were constantly getting kills and banking the items. This game has a learning curve that it would take about a week to get over if you didnt know anything about it and thats why i think it has such a low metascore. This game USED to be so much fun."

The graphics are second rate, attempting a semi-realistic artstyle, that was ultimately only half accomplished.

,Not Recommended,226700,7844149,"Posted: 30 November, 2013",all,shroom2021,"This game is not worth it, not even at half the price, not even for free.The developers appear to have taken advantage of the popularity of DayZ mod to release this unfinished, poor excuse for a game.  The fact that they had to change the name from War Z to ""Infestation Suvivor Stories"" is a great indicator that they may even understand the travesty they released.The game usually starts you in a random part of the map with a flashlight, some food, and bandages.  Not so bad.... unless there is already another player standing nearby.  This will most likely end in your quick death.  Player killing is of course excusable as it is the apocolypse and resources are tight for everyone, but this gets ridiculous.  To the point even that this should be cast a a death match game with zombies in the background, but I digress...  If you aren't immediately gunned down or clubbed to death you are free to wander around looking for resources.  Other than food and bandages you won't find many useful items on the maps.  Zombies are pretty easy to kill, but require many strikes to the head.  Textures are bland so there isn't much to look at while you wander around aimlessly.You can of course loot dead bodies, players and zombies alike.  This will get you cash which you can use to buy items eventually.  The items purchased with in game cash are very expensive and will will take you several hours of gameplay to be able to afford the most basic weapons.  Once you do put in the time and effort, you may be able to afford a spiked bat, which you will lose permanently as soon as you die, which is often.If you take the player killing route, you will probably have more fun.  Looting players for items usually gets you equipped much faster than working together.  You may even find some pretty good weapons on those of us who spent real cash to buy these things.All of that could be forgivable if it weren't so blantantly apparent that this piece of trash is merely a cash grab.  I say this because any item can be lost permanently, including those things you purchase with real money.If you give these guys money for a rifle, then die because: 1. Your game glitches, 2. You didn't see the guy behind you when you spawned, 3. Your game glitches, 4. You see a muzzle flash and things fade to black, 5. Your game glitches.... YOU WILL LOSE THE RIFLE.This is the most unforgivable part of the game, and to me the most offensive.  If you are nice enough to sling a developer more money, why would they still punish you for that?  I just don't understand the design theory here I suppose.  Maybe the game is created specifically for a nitch crowd of masochists who delight in wasting both time and money.So unless you fall into that nitch crowd, I would strongly not recommend this game whether they call it War Z or ""Infestation"" or Susy Q."

You could tell whats a zombie and whats a gun so its all good.The game looks ok also, no major complaints there. It could be better for the performance that it gives.The balance is poor. One weapon is a 1 hit K/O, and some SMGS and the nail gun is extremely weak, even with headshots. The weapon spawnpoints are not too great either, so they can be camped more often than not with relative ease.Overall 7/10Better than DayZ SA in that the action is focused and that there are vehicles that you can use, something that DayZ struggles with to this day."

They make you pay for upgrades, like weapons and ammo, but once you die you lose everything, then have to go and spend more money. Not to mention that you have to wait a LONG time to respawn. The world is boring, the zombies are unrealistic, and the endless chirping of the ever repeating cricket soundtrack makes you want to punch a baby.

I love playing this game, the open world feeling of discovery and random loot... but the support team is just absolutely horrendous! I definitely would NOT advise supporting these developers, because they do NOT support their community. My main account was randomly banned a year ago, and I have submitted over TEN (10!!) support tickets over the last 12 months... all of them being closed before anything was solved. Now if I could just play the game with no problems (such as today: can't login from steam, the updater won't start and it forces an invalid login) I would actually be writing in support of Infestation; However, to put it simply, I will never spend another g0d d@mn dollar on this game or supporting this game in anyway.. it's simply sickening how much their focus on profiteering is. If they would just release a stable client, (or even be understanding that their server clearly has errors (i.e. random permabans)) and actually offer decent support they wouldn't have these mass amount of people turning against them. The developers are literally doing this to themselves... and for what? A short lasting profit spree? I would have actually paid more money and supported them further if I did not have these terrible problems. And I see I'm not the only one! Until the day that my main account is un-banned, or even if I were to hear a resolving answer as to why from the support, I will continue to write negative reviews to keep from other players experiencing this terrible loop of support tickets.~cheers!"

The yellow peels should be at least half browned, and the bananas inside squishy and browning.Ingredients- 2 to 3 very ripe bananas, peeled- 1/3 cup melted butter- 1 teaspoon baking soda- Pinch of salt- 3/4 cup sugar (1/2 cup if you would like it less sweet, 1 cup if more sweet)- 1 large egg, beaten- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract- 1 1/2 cups of all-purpose flourMethod1. Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C), and butter a 4x8-inch loaf pan.2. In a mixing bowl, mash the ripe bananas with a fork until completely smooth. Stir the melted butter into the mashed bananas.3. Mix in the baking soda and salt. Stir in the sugar, beaten egg, and vanilla extract. Mix in the flour.4. Pour the batter into your prepared loaf pan. Bake for 50 minutes to 1 hour at 350°F (175°C), or until a tester inserted into the center comes out clean.5. Remove from oven and cool completely on a rack. Remove the banana bread from the pan.

You trust them some days, but then you stop trusting and then you trust again. It's a cycle.This is a review and I think a review should show you the negative side more than the positive.So... CONS:- You start buying a game with some hardware requirements but you can see this game is going to require more hardware power in the future (developers should limit his work to avoid this to happen).- I know this is a business but there's like a doublespeak from HP. They say ""hey guys, you can now buy anything in-game with game dollars"" and then they add new items for real currency. We just ask some coherence.- HP should take care about bad decisions. They started South American servers and then decided to stop that service because it's expensive, it takes too much work to maintain. But what happens with items collected and stored on that server? 10 days later the items hasn't been returned to owners. And some items cost real money!!! It seems that HP decided to stop hosting in SA, and they don't have access anymore to the database. Very bad.- Support: I can't say anything about this because support doesn't exists. You can wait 1 o 2 months until an answer is received.I have to say I like this game and I'm still playing it, but you have to know this kind of issues before buying this."

I, for one love this game to death. As my hundreds of hours might tell you, I have spent A LOT of time on this game. The reason I still play it? Well, once upon a time, I started the game. I walked around near this helicopter, and zombies were sleeping there. I aggroed them, they came after me and I died. You do only start out with a flashlight taking around 7-10 hits to the head. It makes sense because everybody wants a ""Look a thing! Lets shoot it once or chop its head off and take its stuff!"" kind of experience. Unfortunately, this game is more realistic than that. After I died, I thought I should give it another go, and just died again. I thought the game was total BS.A month or so passes, and I see the game in my library again. I say to myself: Lets try it again. Who knows what'll happen? I load up the game, log in and start adventuring my first town. In the first house I found a spiked baseball bat. 3 Hits to the head to kill. I walk deeper, and in the church was a Kruger .22 Rifle. My mouth drops as I had found my first gun. I thought with this I was unstoppable, so I bought tons of armor and meds and ammo and attachments from the store. I equip it all, then go back into the game. I'm so ready for a guy this time! I spawn behind a box with a tree in front of me. I thought I heard footsteps, so I go down behind the box. A guy slides out slowy with his M4 pointed in my direction. He must have seen me using thirdperson. I get up and start shooting him. But I died. The gun I had was one of the least powerful of all.Point is, this game is hard to reckognize as an astounding game from first glance. You have to play a little more, do some more research and check out different weapons, and most importantly, USE THIRDPERSON.

If you play alone the game gets boring fast, but if you play with a group of friends it can be fun. This game is worth a pickup during a steam sale when it gets knocked down to the price its worth of 5 dollars but not at the current 15 dollars. If your looking for a quick easy game that you can play with some friends and just laugh at how stuiped it can be than this is worth a pickup otherwise this game doesnt have anything to offer. If your looking for a fun Zombie game than I would stick with DayZ (Even though its barly played anymore) or try contagon or nether."

It has a diablo 2 hardcore mode feel to it because when u die u lose all items that are on your body. I love how it captures a real life terrain in a mmo but has an excelent FPS mode aswell. Sometimes i wish there were some public PVE servers, but then i realize thats part of the fun and excitement of the game that you could be murdered at any moment forcing you to take extra percautions and second looks. Although if they added A LOT more zombies for a PVE server i believe it would keep more people interested in playing because not everyone is into the PKing or enjoy being PKed every place they go and just want to kill some zombies with some friends. PVE and PVP aside when i travel through big cities i tend to wonder where all the zombies are. It is afterall a city (thousands and thousands of people) inyet sometimes it seems there is only like 50 zombies in a big city. All in all i love the game and enjoy playing it. At first i thought it was guna be another game i just deleted after 20 min of play but for some reason i just keep playing."

It's the kinda game that's not with amazing graphics or super real experience but the gameplay is awesome, if you play it alone it's insane the way your heart beats when you hear another player walking around in the same house with you, if you play it with friends, the game gets better and better, you can have the entire city in your hands while you and your friends are having a good time.Yeah, it's true, there are many hackers in the game, but I think the game doesn't deserve all that negative votes because it's the best zombie game I have ever played.I'm so sad because now, so much servers are down and the number of players is lower than months ago, but I hope they will fix it and let us play again."

,Recommended,226700,2835346,"Posted: 21 August, 2013",all,GreenJester,"So... this game has a lot of potential. However, I will not say that this is, as many people claim it to be, an aweful game.The thing about this game is that it's extraordinary to play with friends, but the problem is that everyone cooperate. So if you're exploring the world on your own, you'll probably get ganked by groups... a lot.What you should also know, is that the developers of the game are total asses, and  they are slow at fixing things. They actually tended to ignore a lot of well-known glitches and bugs in the game until recently. What you should also know, is that the game also runs poorly if your PC isn't too great. Yet, the graphics acutally look pretty decent.Do not be fooled by old reviews, as this game has improved quite a lot since the alpha (which is where most reviews have taken place). Also, the number of hackers used to ruin this game, but they recently added an anti-cheat (PunkBuster) which actually works.Another flaw with this game is that the zombie animations are very ugly, and it can be quite tricky killing them as they move in weird ways. There has also been implemented fast zombies, which in my opinion was a bad idea, seeing that the zombie attack animations still are ♥♥♥♥♥♥.Another bad thing about the game is that most of the players who play this game are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s who you should not try to communicate with, as it will result in permanent brain damage.If you are gonne play this game with friends, then I would recommend it for you. However, if you are going to play alone, and you don't enjoy ""Survival Free-For-All"" shooters in general, then this game is not worth the money (currently 13€). You should totally try this game out if it's on sale, tho'.BTW: There is A LOT of false advertising in the pictures which previews the game on steam and YouTube - I'd say that 50% of the pictures on Steam shows content that is not in the game, such as weaponary, clothing, playermodels and animations.Please look up recent gameplay in order to be fully convinced about buying it."

I can honestly say I like this game better than DayZ.-Zombies don't walk through walls or fences or buildings-I like seeing my HUD-My hunger and thirst are on bars instead of just a word indicating the level-I like the PvP and seeing the person I killed fall to the floor the second they die instead of waiting 10 sec of them standing there before they fall-Loot and food is found easier than DayZ-I don't have to open my inventory to reload my gun-It is not as P2W as everyone says it is. I haven't spent a dime on this game after buying it and I've found several items that could be bought in the shop in regular spawn locations for items.--You can buy ammo, melee weps, armor, and helemts in the shop for money you can earn in-game.

76561198014792544,Recommended,226700,2934402,"Posted: 20 July, 2013",all,Mo66y,"So this will be my first review ever, and its hard to find a way to begin. At this moment I dont play Infestation any longer, and thats because of several reasons. ill start at the beginning, I bought this game on summersale last year like many others, and at that time I surely never would think that I would spend over 1000 hours off my life on this game, and it would become my second most played game ever. Almost everyone said that the game sucked etc, but most of them must hardly have even tested it, and the reviewers on youtube for example only tested it when it came out, and it was almost impossible to play.But that is in the past, much changed later on. Firstly I started this game with my best friend, and it was our first ""open-world"" kind of game, and it was AWESOME. I remember how afraid we were when we crouched in the grass to avoid zombies and other players, and we had extremely high pulse! later on we bought a private server so we could relax more, and just focus on PVE and zombies and no players. After many hours we knew the map, where to find loot etc. Then we started playing online togehter, and it was so much fun! then more and more of our friends joined and we made a clan. So for 6 months, we skype`ed and played EVERY single day, im impressed my dad didnt think I had died in my room, since I almost never leaved it. So playing togheter 5-6 persons online, make`ing base`es, killing players, collecting loot, was the best feeling ever, so I would say playing with friends makes it 10 times better! but as many people said, the game suffered from many hackers, OMG, it was so many hackers sometimes it was incredible haha. A friend of me that lives in germany tried hacking himself at a period, and at the worst he encountered a hacker for each 2-3 person he met. But we chose one of the small ""cities"" as our main playground, that is calles Smallville, here we had the same server we always played on, and made bases etc that made it almost impossible for hackers to aimbot us and so on, if they didnt come all the way into our bases, and then we always co-operated to kill the hackers, and almost never, did the hacker/hackers manage to kill all of us without we killing them. Fourtunately we almost never met hackers with god-mode, thats impossible to kill. so after many hours we became so good that we almost never got killed by others than hackers, except some times when giant clanes attacked us. So it is so much fun to do, either have a own server or go online and just walk miles after miles and loot cities or small villages for food, weapons, gear and so on. But fighting other players was the best. And what I liked so good with this game is that is has a global inventory, so if you die and lose ur gear, you can just go to the lobby, and fill ur charachter up with the stashed gear u have, and join back in to the server.But at the end when the ""makers"" of the game started to take the game serious as many waited for so long, I think in my opnion, it became worse.. it was new maps, updates all the times and so many new things to get used to, and that killed the game in my eyes, and slowly over time more and more of my clan quitted playing the game, and at the end, as the last one standing, I gave up to.. I REALLY miss all the happy times togheter with my friends in this game from the time when the game was how I enjoyed it.. After I stopped playing I stopped gaming almost completely, now I just focus on school and other things in life. But sometimes I watch movies on youtube or Dakotaz`s stream (one of the most famous players from this game) and I think back on the good old times.. sometimes I feel like crying, I can never understand how ♥♥♥♥ing great this game was.. and only god knows how much money I ""invested"" in this game, it was more than 1000 dollars for sure, and it was well spended! so to you that consider buying this game, I recommend buying this for sure, but in my opinion, u have missed the gold age, which I would say was between july to december 2013, when the game was like in the ""beginning"" of my start. I wish I could go back in time and play it all over, but this time record all the 1k hours off gameplay and skype-talking, so that I could watch it over and over again.. So I hope that new players that starts in the middle of a ""revelution"" in this game, gets to know it as good as i did.. and in my last words I say that, DONT listen to people saying that this game is♥♥♥♥♥♥ it is good, but is has surely been better! and when ur getting good at it, and also have friends with you, encountering hackers is a piece of cake, but be carefull at open areas, or the aimbot will kill you before u even understand what hit you ;) I give the golden age of my gametime, 10/10."

Like gambling, you can choose to gear up your character to your needs or liking. and the more you take, the more you risk of likely losing them. On the up-side, the more geared you are, the more prepared you will be in pvp. To conclude it, it is simply risk vs reward.Pro: You own a global inventory, and like a private bank or vault, you can store all your stash you've collected. The game's visual is amazing, including weather aspect, details.Cons: Many hackers (2 or 3 out of 10 players statistically hack) (you can report them with a touch of a button, and they do get banned eventually, but many hackers either buy new accounts or used accounts, and continue to hack). The more players there are in the server, the more likely the hackers will be there. Lower player servers tend to be safe and hack free."

LOW, be prepared to kill who ever when ever, they say there friendly join up with you and the second you let your guard down your stuff is now theres,  Granted u can group and play with People some times and all goes well but the majority of open servers and non-private clans are blood thirsty murder dens...if thats your slice of pie your in heaven kill and expect to be killed at all times, Trust must be earned in this enviroment.Overall: Play stealthy and smart or join a private PvE Clan that owns a server or knows how to handle them selves in open world, the game can be difficult and challenging to some and quite easy to others.Final Verdicts:Enjoyable: YesChallenging: YesPay to Win/Cash shop: No/Useless ( cosmetics are nice if your into character features but can also be obtained with out spending money )PVP: HardcoreHackers: Very limited after new security features / Counter Measures and NONE in private Passworded servers ( unless a hacker clan owns the server but then u probably dont have the password any ways )Price: 10$ would be a more solid price for alot of people but i am fine with the 15$ price tag as i have quite enjoyed the game.Dayz: It isint dayz....its not like dayz.....if you played dayz you would know this......dont compare the two, either play it or dont"

The map has safe zones where you can access your global stash and also purchase items from vendors. The goal of the game is to survive and thrive. Zombies are lethal in packs, though other survivors are the most dangerous. XP is gained from Zombies, which can be spent on perks in the skill tree like Rule #1 Stamina for 1000xp, or reducing the rate at which you need food and water. Stealth and situational awarness are key to looting and surviving so you can make it back to the safe zone and stash your precious loot. Side Note: I really love playing when its night time with night vision, Badassdom is the general feeling. Many of the areas with the best loot like sniper rifles and other rare loot have groups of zombies and higher zombie respawn rates, so if you want to play coop just hit me up."

It's plagued with bugs that disconnect you most often while getting in and out of a vehicle.  Sometimes, for no reason at all.  It's a crappy execution of a great idea.  PVP definitely gives an advantage to those who play in 3rd person.  If you play in first person and loathe 3rd person like I do, plan on getting killed a lot.  There are glitches in 3rd person that allows the player to literally see over walls and around corners.  The loot spawn quality totally depends on how active the server has been.  If the server has gone to sleep, all the loot despawns after about 30 minutes and takes 1-2 hours to regenerate.

When and if you do ever come across a friendly player, there is no way of ""Grouping"" up with them making it hard to play in groups unless you VOIP outwith the game with pre-existing friends. With handheld weapons the Zombies are harmless one at a time but in groups are deadly if you dont have a long ranged weapon making it too easy or too hard to survive (never between)(-)Looting -Good, frequent spawning makes ""farming"" moderatly easy with minimal obsticles, meaning you can build up quite the stock of Weapons, Armor, Food and Medical Supplies so when you die you are not going to be as mad as you would be in the likes of DayZ. (+)Progression -Good also, there are character slots where you can make slightly customisable characters with different clothes, each character has its own set of skills that you can upgrade with experience points you get from killing Zombies. (+)Overall -I would give The WarZ or ""Infestation: Survivor Stories"" or what ever they decide on calling it next month, a 7 out of 10 It's a good game, but in some places it requires improvement. For $4.50 on♥♥♥♥♥its well worth it and i would definetly reccommend it.

The game is much better .. but its still no award winner.  that said here is what i think nowThe just ok enough to hook you:Nice character selectionreally huge open worldrealistic game play hunger /thrist)it can be a blast when you find a server that is PVEZombiesThe stuff that will amke you leave screaming and running:Character models and art ripped off form other matierals/sourcesyou lose EVERY THING you are carrying when you die which leades to  the next point...You die a lot because....Total PvP  that encourages  PvP over co-operation,PvE servers have no offical support but they do existwalking for miles and miles  and miles and miles....That said i have heard they stopped requiring real money on every thing in the in game store  (this is true).. so maybe that will help aliviate the woes of losing every thing you have on you.  I also heard they added cars to the game  so i do plan on checking this game out again .. (see there's that poo hook) the car thing confirmed  and it improved the game a lot. I wound up liking this  alot more now  That said its one big Day-Z clone that rode in one DZ's hype and fell on its face due to a pushed out release. It's not bad but non zombie fans will find it lackign in the face of other offerings , with  the changes i'vce seen i'll say its a 50%  out of 100% game.  not great but not bad either there is soemthign here now to enjoy.UPDATE: game is dead now no servers"

As far as a Zombie games go, its one of the better that I've played.The graphics are good. You have tha ability to either sneak around zombies, or go in guns blazing. The zombie detection mechanic is very easy to understand, green=unlikely to be detected, Yellow=Be careful, Red=Stop moving/making sound. I've run into a few lag issues with the game, but minor lag at times is to be expected from ANY MMO. It also has an 18 min respawn per character(Can have ~8 Characters) which can prevent mindless running back to your corpse to get all loot back or You can pay real money to respawn immediately. The game doesn't deserve the amount of hate it gets.The only issues I can see with the game currently is, lack of ability to build a base, everything in the in game shop is really expensive(a bag of chips is like 1000 dollars, and you usually get 18-40 dollars off every 5-10 zombies you kill) the game is mildly 'pay to win' as you can pay real money to unlock new characters, guns, ammo, armor etc. It can be hard to start-up if you're coming into the game currently because people have such a stockpile of weapons and ammo. Everyone that I've run into also Kills on Sight.Overall for a 5 Dollar game(at the time of review) I'd say it is Definitely worth giving it a shot."

Game sounds awesome but when you play its not so bad but dont get killed cause you will lose everything. I spent like $10 on equipment and started a new character and 2 min into my game where i spawned there was a camper waiting and killed me and took all my stuff so now i lost $10 of stuff in like 2min. real low blow guys.  maybe the other player can take your food and water but why yor armor and weapons you worked hard for or even paid for with real money.

Simply not the environment I'm looking for in a survival apocalyptic zombie game.  Was released way too early with a lot of unfilled promises as things for this company spiraled out of control.  However, persistence paid off and they are still here barring the negative Metascore which in the end says something for this title and the devs working on it.This is not an environment suitable for the lone new player.   There were moments that the game felt good like when i flashlight battled a guy over a medkit and a couple small supplies by a radio tower.  Or investigated a few sites with only me and the zombie crew around.  Then the reality of this being a chaotic player killing area came into full effect starting with the abundant camping around safe areas.  Travel by foot can be tedious and long in this game to go from site to site and after struggling to find any firearm and constantly getting ganked near any areas of interest I decided it best to walk away from trying this game anymore.However, there is some light at the end of this tunnel....Devs are in the business of making money, they aren't friendly but they aren't terribly and they just don't want anyone to bash this game on their sites which if someone came to my work and defaced my property in my face I wouldn't tolerate that either.  Perhaps its from the constant ragging they are receiving on a moderately decent finished product they have or just how the dice rolls but the negativity given to this game seems to be a ""bandwagon"" style chorus.  Its definately not worth a full sticker price more like a 80-90% sticker price buy and then only if you want to just check it out versus the other games on the market in this similar genre which i would buy first.In the end its a 3/10 game for a single player.5/10 recommended for a group of friends to buy together when on sale and play through the content with teamwork for the pvp and pve in the game."

,Not Recommended,226700,14797920,"Posted: 8 March, 2015",all,Hausu,"Where do I even begin with this game. First off ive been playing this game for about 7 years now and every playthrough ive had of it was exellent. There is alot of variety when it comes to builds. There is the obvious Light/Dark or Grey option for the game but there is also Force user builds, Ranged builds, Pure combat focused guardian, etc. I find the combat to be enjoyable (In my opinion) since its tactical and you can really plan attacks and things of that sort. Take DA:0 for example. Its pretty much the same system. You can start with 3 beginning classes: Guardian (Combat focused), Sentinel (Better skill progression), and Consular (Force powers). You then later in the game get different set of prestige classes depending on your allignment. Now, lets get to the writing of the game. This game has one of the best stories I have ever seen. You'll see once you play it for yourself. The reason I prefer this game slightly over the first is just because I prefer the darker, philosophical, grey aspects of the atmosphere and story a bit better (Kotor 1 is also one of my favorite games). Anyways, this game presents the idea that Dark is not necessarily evil and Light isnt nessesary good and you really get to see the Flaws of both sides. For example, you play as the Jedi Exile, who was exiled from the Jedi order for rusing to war to protect innocents. The Jedi were lazy and waited to ""evaluate the threat"". The dialouge and voice acting in this game is absolutely fantastic (Especially Kreia). For this game, you dont even need to be a fan of Star Wars. A non Star Wars fan would look at this game and just play an RPG. However a Star Wars fan would look at this and play an amazing Star Wars RPG. The reason for this is because the game is set in an era wayyy before the Movies. One flaw however, would be the cut content presented this game. Obsidian (The developers) were rushed to release this game by lucasarts, resulting in them needing to cut out content for the game. Luckily, a group of community modders managed to get into the games files and restore alot of the content that was cut. You can find the mod on the steam workshop. Anyways, hurry up and buy the game! You wont be dissapointed."

I bought rounds for a shotgun, and when I used them, NONE of the rounds were hitting them, so I endded up dying again with new stuff while trying to salvage my older stuff when I died from before.The mechanics are OUTDATED, which can explain my shots not registering, the Zombies will chase afteryou and continuously hit you until you die, you literally have to buy everything. ♥♥♥♥♥ outdated and they changed it from being an ok game to now impossible to survive unless you have a lot of supplies, which if you dont find a lot *which you wont* you have to buy with real money.I had logged off at a safe camp changing out my supples from a locker, when I logged back in, I was at the airport surrounded by zombies. why didnt it log me back at the locker when I had logged back in???

I DO NOT RECOMMEND it is not worth $15 either, it should be made a free to play. and the fact that the gc store in ISS, it is a rip off you get 700 gc thats 40k game dollars thats and considering most stuff in the game is 5kin up. it doesnt last, a loxbock is $9 now that is just crazy.

Fun realistic survival trying to scavenge for food, water, weapons, and basic protection.2. It take's a while to get anywhere, but there are vehicles now, there fast, but hard to find, at least for me lol, but i am listing this as a pro's because if they were everywhere it would make fighting to survive to easy, and kill a major part of the game.3. Reasonable zombies, a gun and a head shot instant kill anything else is kind of a pain and reminds me of using the knife is Resident Evil 1 for those who know what im talking about lol.4. Nice Sized Open World5. There is a day / night system, and it can really get dark at night lolCon's1. There is no tutorial so you are on your own learning how to play.2. There is absolutely no friendly people, its strictly every man (or woman) for themselves.3. Joining a Server Fail's pretty often."

,Recommended,226700,9187365,"Posted: 19 February, 2014",all,RMCora,"I hope you find this review helpful, not as an objective factual point by point rundown of the game, but as simply one player's perspective of this game to take into consideration.This game is different from many others, an open-world open-PvP zombie survival game. Obviously, this game at the very least takes inspiration from Day-Z, which I haven't played, and so in fairness won't be part of my comparison. I:SS has also made several notable improvements over time as well:- I love the cooldown respawn penalty in the game when dying, giving a bit more weight to the threat of dying, but 8-12 hours was far too much. 20 minutes now? Feels a lot closer to perfect in my opinion. Enough to time try your hand at an alternate character you might have waiting.- Don't know who to trust? Now there is reputation to know whose been taking out the bad guys, and whose been dealing death to anyone in sight. There is still a risk of betrayal however, which only plays towards the main spirit of the game which I love: trust and deceit.- The skill system feels slightly basic, but still solid enough to give some real incentive to gather that experience. Perhaps there is value to its simplicity, keeping it streamlined and not overly impacting on the game, keeping the game still skill based.- Vehicles are now in the game, and a welcome twist, yet again, still not common enough to negatively impact the central aspects of the game.The great central part of the game remains unchanged though: surviving in a zombie infested world where the main threat is not the zombies, but fellow humans. How much are you willing to scavenge, and risk losing when you die, especially once you find that rare, hard-to-find item? What weapons will you bring to fight, and risk dropping if you lose? How much can you really trust that friendly person standing right next to you? Sure he might be a deputy, but he's still human, and can still have his own dark ways. That's the spirit of the game that makes it exciting.Sure, this game might not be everyone's idea of fun, but it certainly is mine, and that is why this game gets my recommendation. If you decide to try it, I hope you find it's your idea of fun as well."

At the current price of less than $3 Canadian during the Steam Winter Sale I definitely recommend people buying this.Now the negatives with this game are that people seem to complain of hackers and so spending money on any extras for this game might not be what you want to do.  Also I guess the animations for the zombies could be better but that is really nit picking at the game as it looks good enough for what it is.Anyway glad I decided to finally play a game that had been left alone too long in my back log of games."

,Recommended,226700,9838117,"Posted: 16 April, 2014",all,nuggs,"To be honest, everyone out there just says this game is♥♥♥♥♥♥because they go into the game hating it. There might be other games such as DayZ out there, but this shoudln't be compared to it. They are both entirely different games. ISS is supposed to be an arcade, casual game, not an intense survival game. I admit, there are some bugs in this - the most annoying being the vehicle bugs- but its actually pretty fun if you have a few mates. Dont hate on me for just saying this game isnt as bad as everyone says- it isnt- i think that for $5, if you go into this game without thinking its going to be bad, you will have a good time. Just a tip, this game is very relentless so dont go into the cities with a flashlight expecting to be able to get the best gear, you have to work up to it.Also, about what other people have been saying, how its pay to play, it isnt. First of all, you cant buy guns or ranged weapons with money, only supplies, ammo and melee weapons. Now, even if you think a melee weapon can be OP, ranged weapons are easy to find, however ammo is very rare. This means that even if someone has a good melee weapon, you can easily fight against them. So stop raging about how its pay to play, there are many other games out there that do it tooPROSVery fun with matesRunning over zombies with vehicles looks really weirdLarge mapHigh replayabilityIts $5!CONSSome annoying (not game breaking) bugsA small amount of hackersSometimes being kicked or banned for falling down mountains (punkbuster thinks speedhack)Steep learning curveLots of 12viesRATINGWorld: 8/10Replayability: 7/10Graphics: 7/10Difficulty/Learning Curve: 9/10OVERALL: 33/40"

I was killed by somebody on teh way to the safe zone.  Couldn't tell if it was an NPC or a real player as I got kicked by a punkbuster ""update"" because the servers are just... terrible.If you go to the support pages you'll see that everything under Tips & Tricks mention people getting banned for no reason.  On top of that, they mention several responses from the company stating that it's never banned anyone who wasn't hacking and they will not do anything to help.  There's even a thread about how to sue Hammer Point if you've wasted money buying credits.I can only guess that the meta score of 20 was given not only because of the company, but also because of the community.  After being spawned on a map with nothing telling me where to go or what to do (annoying, but kind of makes sense) I ran to what I only assumed to be where I should go since it has a red circle around it on my map. That's when I get shot by someone in full camo with and AR.  No warning or nothing.  As I said before I couldn't find the name out of the almost 100 people on the server since the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ devs didn't come up with the bright idea to sort the user list.

,Recommended,226700,2554956,"Posted: 14 April, 2013",all,Mother Abigail,"When first played, it can be VERY addictive and difficult to get used to. It all depends on how great you are at strategy and team work. Playing PVP is RIDICULOUSLY hard if you don't have the right equipment. YET, you don't want to lose your prized posessions because you can EASILY lose your stuff which is REALLY crappy since you can RARELY find really good stuff in certain towns and that you have to pay for it in marketplace if you really wanted to. Private servers are way easier when you just want to kill zombies and gain experience without the fact you are being hunted down by other people. I am not going to rate the game at a terrible point since this just came out and they are still working on it, but I have to say that their recent updates are really bad. I am hoping things get put back together correctly so I can play the game at a regular pace. Overall the slight mistakes of the game, I sincerely give this game a 9/10. I love it.

Once you start to get some items and be able to defend yourself (may take some time) it is really fun. It took me maybe 6 deaths before i finally got somewhere and found a big buliding which was full of items, and once i started to shoot zombies and get somwhere the fun really started.  My friend also bought it the same time and once you have met its even better constantly looking out for each other but also trying to plan your next move together. At one point i was sitting in a tall building with a M16 overwatching my friend who was trying to get in the same buliding and it was actually a very imersive moment of gaming. Only bad points we have found yet is most other players do not care about you or your wellbeing, they just want to shoot and loot at all times, also once you have found good items and guns do not think your are invincible and do not get attached to them as it only takes a couple of miss timed dodges from a zombies swing and you will die and loose everything. At the moment i can only really think of one other game for this to compete with and that is DayZ, but as it stands curently of March 24th 2014 i think infestation is a more complete experience and is more focused on the zombie front rather than PvP currently offered by DayZ. If you are well off and willing the pay the £11 asking price and you no what to expect in this type of game then go for it, and while its in a sale for £1 i dont see how anyone can resist it, even if you dont enjoy it its only a quid!"

Unfortunatley the dev's (when they are seen) only tend to make the game worse. It incorporates the graphic of a PS2, the microtransactions of a phone app, and the cheating of a politician. Items bought in their market are only available on a ""as long as you don't actually take it anywhere"" basis as they are lost anytime your character is killed by the hackers who plague the servers unchecked or suffer the occasional brain aneurysm from lagging out in front of the occasional, poorly placed zombie horde.THIS IS THE IMPORTANT PART:They are practically abandoning this game all together in fact their new game Aftermath's website even states that it is the spiritual successor to this one. Buying this is not only a waste of your money but your time, sanity, and a small piece of your self respect.Also, they've been involved in quite the controversy over practically every part of their game being stolen from other games / popular media.

I came in not too long ago, paid $1.50 for it (why not?) and have HIGHLY enjoyed it since. People want to compare it to DayZ, or Rust, or other zombie/survival games. It's not DayZ for starts, it has more of a ""game"" feel and less of the ""hardcore survival"" aspect.I like the skill tree for character. I like the zombie behavior, detection meter, the fact you can approach one crouched, swing your weapon to get it's attention and lore it in, to pick them off one by one.I like how the zombies remain in the areas worth noting (around some cars in the road, towns, a crashed plane, etc) but between those places you get a zombie free enviroment.I like the fact loot has a glowing outline when you close, and a large easy to read name/interact pop-up. Is it realistic? No...it's a game.I'm NOT a fan of PvP, or people who will just kill others...however the community is not ALL that bad (compared to my Rust/DayZ experiences) and on most private PVE servers, you don't have to worry as much.I went and even got a server, for me and my RP buddies. RP can add a lot to a storyless multiplayer game.I'm not saying it's the GREATEST ZOMBIE GAME EVER (State of Decay is ;) ) but it's not as bad as people say.I haven't seen a single hacker, experienced NO crashes aside from when CLOSING the game (big deal), and no bugs outside of the somewhat buggy vehicles, which they are reworking.It's NOT pay-to-win. You can use real $$ to buy in-game $, but IG$ can only be used for SOME melee weapons, food/water, equipment, and gun ammo/attachments. You have to FIND the better melee weapons and ANY guns.These guys deserve at LEAST enough support to get the game finished to where they want it. I want to see California make it out of testing, vehicles to be finished, maybe even more things added/smoothed out.ALSO people mention FPS/Performance issues...I have none running the game on Ultra with AA. Specs: A8-5600k APU, 8GB 1866mhz RAM, HD 7870 graphics.That's my two cents. If you haven't played it in awhile, give it another try. If it's on sale for $1.50, give it a shot. Hell even at $15 I'd say you'll at least get your moneys worth. Lot's of people pay $30-$60 for a game with only 24 hours worth of game."
,Not Recommended,226700,10467010,"Posted: 13 June, 2014",all,TrIcKsTeRR,"I haven't played this game long because I hate it.... It could be because the servers are too expensive to rent, so you are forced to play in a public server where people can kill you and take all the stuff you worked so hard for.... It takes 10 years to go anywhere by foot and unless you have a weapon, you don't stand a chance against more than a couple zombies, niot to mention you can run 2 metres from them and when they swipe you they still manage to take half of your health.... The whole hunting of supplies can get very annoying, especially after you die, you lose everything unless you put your items in the safe...which as your entering the area where the safe is...people sit there and wait for you to come along.... This game is very glitchy and frustrating to beginners like myself.... It's a great concept but they made it too difficult....I'd personally recommend you spend your money on State of Decay instead if you like zombie Survival....the big difference is that Infestation is an MMO where State of Decay is single player.... I am biased as I hate MMO games but even in a private server with friends....this game was a horrible experience.... I suggest you watch some gameplay footage before you buy it....

This game does have problems (mainly hacker based, because it seems they feel the need to pay RL$ to hack in a game with digital items).This game is primarily a Kill On Sight, clans are the best way to play this game. Don't get attached to anything you win or thus lose. One of the MAJOR downsides of this game is the poor optimization. In the character selection menu graphic card use goes up to 99%.Infestation is a PVP based game with looting (as a method of acquiring gear) and zombie killing (as a way to level up your character and to acquire zombie cash to then buy things on the market). The market place has very screwy prices, but is still not a pay to win like a lot of people think it is.If you are looking into buying this game take note of a few things:This game is primarily PVPThe best way to play/stay alive to to join a clan.There are hackers but that doesn't mean they can't be killed.The game is Kill On Sight.Don't get attached to your gear.For those complaining about this game all I can say is if you are buying a 2.50-15.00$ game, why do you expect the quality of gameplay/storyline/quality of performance that you would with a 60$ game backed by a real company. This game is great for what it is, a survival game that is based looting which turns into PVP and then zombies get in the way. This is not a true zombie survival game by any means, this game is strictly PVP."

,Recommended,226700,7968367,"Posted: 8 December, 2013",all,Miley Cyrus,"I bought this game when it was super cheap because i wanted to play something similiar to Arma's DayZ modification. I didn't really like the game when i played it for the first time, but i was playing with my friend and it was a good way to spend an evening. Many people complaining about devs are not active in the game and that they don't give a s**t about the game. When i started playing, the devs started working, the game was getting better. The devs we're making updates almost every week. Few days ago they added a new map Colorado V2, which is about twice bigger than Colorado V1. They even showed a new map California on a live stream hosted by Artemis Knives [Dev] which is still in development but it's bigger than Arma's Altis. Things are moving really fast and vehicles should be added by the end of this year.Now a little bit about graphics. This game is not well optimized, and you are sometimes getting fps drops even on a decent gaming PC. But it's not like you are getting fps drops every few seconds or so, but it happens. Overall graphics looks good - buildings, cars, grass. Only one thing worries me. Yes, trees. Their texture is absolutely terrible, but it's okay if you don't care about texture of trees. If you want beautiful graphics, go play Crysis.I've played over 50 hours without having to deal with cheaters/hackers. Game is crashing on a 32-bit systems, but who has 32-bit system nowadays? Sometimes the server kicks you out of game, but who cares, it's not a big deal.I'm not paying for GC or respawning or for premium in this game. I hate microtransactions. People complaining about microtransactions in this game should shut up. You don't need to buy GC or premium, no one is pushing you into it. You can play the game without paying for GC with no problems.This game is underrated. I'm not saying the game wasn't bad in Alpha or when it was released but it's a good game so give it a try, buy it when it's cheap and enjoy this game with your friends.Infestation: Survivor Stories / WarZ : 7/10"

The game itself is pretty buggy and not very immersive but like i said, its fun with friends if you know how to have fun with it.It was also kind of insulting to see a market place to use real money when I had already paid for the game.

Overall I'd say the game is nearly finished in terms of all things game, and for the time being, it can e played for an unlimited amount of time thanks to the current california testng phase.Try the game out, give it a MOMENT of your time, and you will learn to enjoy WarZ for what it is."

I bought 3 copies, 1 for myself and 2 for my nephews that live with me. We played for a bit when I first bought them, then we took a break and recently we tried to play again since they added new content and some changes. I logged in ok, my 18yr old nephew logged in okay but my 15yr old could not log in. He got a message that said his ""Account was permanently banned"". I have submitted ticket after ticket on both my log in and his log in and we have only got 1 response. It said that they might have detected 3rd party software was used and that the decision for banishment would not be overturned. I read in a forum that the entire Infestation game was hacked and that they had to have all players change their passwords. So someone could have hacked his account but we have to pay for that by being banished with no chance of having it overturned. There is no 'Live"" help desk or phone number to call. All this company is interested in is taking your money and letting hacks rule the servers and offering no help what so ever to their customers who want to support the game. DO NOT WASTE your TIME or MONEY. Trust me, eventually it will happen to you and you will be in the same boat that we are in. If there was a five star rating system for games I would give this game a NEGATIVE FIVE STARS.DAY Z is looking better and better all the time.**** UPDATE to Review *******This game still ticks me off with all the HACKING and CHEATING that goes on. I wish they would take the game off line and modify it so that detecting and banishing true HACKERS would be super easy and clean the game up to nothing but TRUE HONEST PLAYERS. I have logged in and went to to a town and remained totally hidden and from out of no where a single shot from a long way away and BOOM I am dead from one bullet. I kind of feel like PRESIDENT KENNEDY and the BENDABLE BULLET THEORY. I will keep a close eye on the game and if they ever use the money they get from us players and UPGRADE the ANTI CHEAT software then I would take another stab at the game."

The countless zombie kills are rewarding due to the skill tree and the PvP is a great mix. Put aside the hackers and you get pretty good gun fights. The zombies are a danger but not over powered nor under powered they are very noticed unlike some games (I won't mention). My biggest complain is this past wednesday (3-16-16) the company closed down the servers which are still down and haven't given anyone a reason as of why. No updates and no communication to the players and fans that have supported this game. I think that's pretty low. I'd rate this game all together a 7.5 out of 10.

,Not Recommended,226700,7111548,"Posted: 7 August, 2013",all,Fumb Duck,"Do not buy this game! EVER! Yup, as you can probably already tell I was unfortunately one of the many poor ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s that jumped on the Steam $3.74 sale bandwagon! Oh, wow what a shame. This is by far the most absolutely horrible, pathetic, lamest, crappiest, and a few more blankety blank blanks game I have ever played. I've never written a review or bothered with anything like this before, but this game has motivated me to do so now. This game is purely pay to maybe win and free to lose and die, suffer, regret, and rage, to the extreme. I'll lay out some math for you... They start you out with a flashlight, a granola bar, and a bottle of water. If you stand there without moving your thirst and hunger degenerate, which is fine, but it's to the extent that you have to eat and drink something roughly every 10 15 minutes. Huh, that's lame. Now, you have to find food and water by going into zombie infested areas which isn't too horrible, you have to survive, that's understandable. But then the map is really small and there's usually about 20 30 players minimum in any server at any time, so good luck getting the good stuff as a noob with a flashlight going against hordes of zombies and other dudes with guns, and not to mention you have about 30 minutes to do so otherwise you starve to death or die of thirst. But! You can buy food and water in the store! =O Holy crap, hallelujah! (Can't believe I spelled that right the first time.) Downside A bottle of water costs $400 in game cash, or a certain amount of gold coin things that you can only get with real money where 5 USD gets you 615 or so. So, $400 in game cash for a bottle of water. How hard could that be to get with only a flashlight and 30 minutes to spare? Well, according to the Wiki zombies have a 1:10 chance of dropping cash. They only ever really drop about 30-50 bucks in cash each time. So if you're lucky, you can afford a single bottle of water in about 30 zombie kills...maybe. And no, flashlights don't kill zombies very fast if you're wondering. Now, on top of this, the voice chat a good idea except people who pay out their asses for this game are as pathetic as what they sound, total BLANK-holes that shoot first, skip the questions, and hump your dead face. Horrible gaming community involved with this game, the customer support has never gotten anything but terrible reviews, they are obviously only using this game to make money, ripping their customers off at any chance they get, and don't forget that they can ban you for crashing if they decide to, or ban you for no reason at all, instead of actually having a passion for game design and providing something at least partially half way decent to play. The graphics suck, the game play is worthless, and the price is beyond insane. If there are any good reviews ANYWHERE about this game, they are most likely being paid by whatever hammer industry that devised this scam to rip people off. You can only play the game at first by playing a male, so if you're a girl and want to play as a female, you have to get $150,000 in game cash to buy the character, or spend about $5 to get a character. Every item that you use real life currency to purchase goes BYE BYE if you die, nothing is retained after you die. And you have to wait an hour before you can play again on that character. If there's any more crap about this game that I'm missing, I'm sure there's plenty of it left out there, eventually you'll walk right into the fan spraying all the BLANK, enjoy if you give this game a chance, I'd strongly suggest seeing the 20/100 metacritic score and avoid this catastrophe. This concludes my review, I am a proud survivor of this ridiculous infestation for three and a half hours, and now most currently a beyond proud and relieved uninstaller of Infestation Survivor Stories with way more BLANKS then any game should allow. I feel sorry for anyone who gives this game a chance, it's not worth it, and they only want your money without giving anything in return."

I will warn that this game, often times after the devs update it, crashes upon launch or entry of the game, and has a few bugs here and there within the game.  HOWEVER, when you can play this game, this provides the most entertaining shooter/survival/zombie experience to date.  This game, in my opinion (and I might get bashed for this) is a hundred times better than DayZ.  This game is better optimized for the PC, graphics are better, user interface and gameplay is much more user friendly, and the gameplay is simply fantastic and never gets old.  If the devs can fix the minor bugs within the game, as well as fix some crashing issues, this would really be one of the best games out there. Awesome game.  I would give this game a perfect score if the bugs and crash issues are fixed, but for now, I will give it a 92/100 until these issues are fixed."

Other than that, the game isn't too bad to play, especially when playing with a group of friends. The ""pay to win"" is a bunch of crap; you can survive easy playing on a server full of decent people, looting in the cities to get the better items. If you have great patience and like a decent zombie mmo, then get this game, it's only like $7aud. 5/10 because ♥♥♥♥ you hackers."

Sometimes it can be hard to loot around, but you just gotta find clan that has a private server and you will be set! This game has some amazing potential, but I do think the devs are not the best. They haven't focused on the game very much and only do these sales so we pay money. They don't update the game weekly anymore either.

Even anything the things they are using are more annoying, you can't tap out for really any time, they get errors that take forever to get fixed... This game isn't even ""finished"" yet.What really grinds my gears is that you can't have a PVE mode server. Yes killing people and taking their stuff is fun, but if you don't wanna play that kind of game only say to do so is have a server that costs like 60 some bucks. Only good thing is you can now group up and not kill your team mates. The new zombies they're added is kinda neat but there is no option to have them or not to have them in private servers."

It is however a shame that there are so many IGNORANT people out there who have their head so far up their arses who continue to mock the game due to it's terrible condition when it was first released. Get up to date, that was months ago! This game has improved so much more since then.It is recommended that you travel with friends on this game otherwise you will find it VERY difficult to get anywhere on this game. People KOS mainly so you won't really stand a chance making friends with people. Also it has an RPG element which allows you to upgrade your skill tree in the game which makes it more addicting and a goal to work towards. However there are still many hackers on the game, it is rare that you will encounter any though.

I've noticed on lower end Pc's this game is impossible to play with an average framerate of 11 to 14.I will just dot point some pro's and con's below.pro's- Personal vault- Zombies- Grouping and Clans- Fun PvP wars- Wide range of weaponary- Ability to be a Hero or a BanditCon's- Server kicking for no reason- Buggy zombies ( no-clipping and invisible )- paying to revive your dead characters ( unless you wait 60 minutes )- Trigger happy players ( shooting on sight )- Unfinished textures and average audio quality- lack of character customizationAlthough the con's are pretty bad, this game has so much charm about it.So thats my personal opinion on this game, I hope it helped you decide whether you want this game ot not :)Thanks for reading my review."

Let's address the title, it received so much hate because it was very similair as Dayz. but it's by the makers of war inc. they never intended to rip off dayz's name they just decided to stick with the name war, and added the z for zombie, you might argue that's a complete nonsense but this is what i've seen/heard from the developers. i personally enjoy this game a lot, enspecially when playing it at night with a friend. the fear of getting killed is really strong.but there is one  problem it was never the zombies that got us but always the other players. but everyone says that the biggest problem with killing zombies is that it's way to easy and required no skill. yes that's true for 1 zombie because when they are hit by a melee weapon their next attack will miss making it just mindlessly stabbing it in the face for a few times untill it dies. and against 2-3 zombies it's walking back hoping you won't walk into another zombie. and with more then that you are better of running away.but that isn't what you are supposed to do you should avoid them or try to fight them 1 at the time or get your friend to kill one and you another. and what about other player's? well they will shoot you at sight doesn't matter if you are armed or not so you're best of avoiding them. A big problem with the game is that gun's are extremely easy to find so everyone will be running around with em.PvP usually ends up with a sniper bullet to the brains while you couldn't see it coming. but sometimes it's an epic gunfight where every bullet counts so it's not always BS. just. i highly recomend you try out the trial account and if you enjoyed it, buy the full game.it has quite some problem's but they are still working on and aren't giving up support anytime soon.As of the time of writing this review they are working on a new map: California. which also includes vehicles and new weapons. and ofcourse the tension when you are casually walking from place to place and you suddenly hear footsteps.Summary down below!________________________________________________TL;DR   great game but still some issue's. pvp can be ridiculous and the original release was crap.but the game improved a lot and it's only 5 dollars. if you are not sure about buying the game you can play the free trial. also they are adding a new map and loads of content."

The risk/reward is addicting and presents an aspect from games of yesteryear before people started crying over the smallest thing.I was an avid Day Z (mod) Player till this came out, I never went back. The inventory is way better and combat is a lot of fun. As for the DayZ Standalone ...if you are playing it and acting like it's not just liket his game (minus the in game shop) then you are truely fooling yourself. People wanna rag on Infestation (WarZ) but look at all the angry youtube videos with scathing hatred towards the new DayZ stand alone alpha. Many having the same complaints that plague this game. It also uses the ARMA III engine so instead of making a new game they've decided to basically make a mod with a .exe file to make it appear as a stand alone.Anyway...this game is fun, screw the haters they're just trendy♥♥♥♥♥clowns who hate on everything thats not hip...and are probably stealing peoples food stamps."

I will admit its far from perfect, and not even that close to being good! But after playing it for a few hours I've found it to be fairly fun. Firstly, a lot of the mechanics like: when your character dies you must wait an hour to be able to revive them (however you can make a new character) is something that I think a lot of survival games need. The weapon variety is great, more than most FPS games that are around nowadays. The sound is decent enough, it really can make a seemingly empty town creepy as hell. The lighting in this game is fantastic, everything from your flashlight to the lights beams that shoot through the trees at dawn to muzzle flashes (All game should have muzzle flashes like this game) the lighting is the only graphical feature in this game that can be praised however. The game assets are far from beautiful, the models lack geometry, the textures are low res and the animations are absolutely laughable. The one thing that kills this game though is the monetization, the ability to buy in game currency and use it to buy melee weapons and ammo (not guns though) makes the game favourable only if you invest more cash in the game. If you do play this, don't play alone, play with a friend and dont trust ANYONE except those who you dont know in the game since even the good guys will shoot you on sight.4.5/10Only buy this if its on sale and super cheap, its fun to play but not worth more than £3/$4."

,Recommended,226700,6470621,"Posted: 17 September, 2013",all,ShouldNotBe,"Just a little review of this zombie hunting game I’m currently addicted to.First, the negatives...Before I start, a lot of the negatives you might have heard about this game seem to be more or less taken care of by now. There are still a few crashes, but I’ve yet to have one of them get me killed or severely annoy me. I’ve seen a few people complaining about hackers, but I’ve yet to encounter a single one, and their anti-hack systems seem to be keeping on top of things. The community can be very toxic and hostile at times, but there are also a lot of friendly players to be found outside of the PVP focused official and premium servers. The developers make some really boneheaded decisions at times, but they also seem to be responsive to community feedback and focused on improving the game. Perhaps just as importantly, they are aware that some parts of the game haven’t gone off as intended and are working to fix those things. Although the game isn’t all sunshine and roses, it’s nowhere near the broken mess many of the disgruntled community members would lead you to believe.Now for the positives!I went into this game with extremely low expectations, having bought it during the summer sale as a joke with money from card sales. I fully intended to play for a few hours, laugh at how bad the game was, and then never touch it again. Now, after finally sitting down to really play the game a few weeks ago, I’ve clocked 70 hours in game, with 41.3 in the last two weeks, as of writing this review. This game managed to completely change my mind. It took me a few hours of playing to really start to see the fun that could be had with this game not as a race to some defined endgame or level, but as a sandbox for many different kinds of gameplay. I’ve done balls-to-the-wall PVP, group oriented zombie hunts and loots, solo runs with a variety of weapon loadouts through nearly the entire map and weaponless sneaking through zombies and other players, and I’ve enjoyed it immensely. The combat is straightforward and uncomplicated, but can quickly become intense when you need to balance the need to deal with threats without alerting zombies or other players, all while trying to reach that next building, that next tent, that next spot to see what loot might be there. The interface is straightforward and clean, providing you the information you need without cluttering up the window more than necessary. Likewise, the controls never get in the way of gameplay, and I’ve never had an issue with them. Nothing in the game tries to get between you and making your fortune in the zombie hordes, and once you figure out how you want to make that fortune, the game really opens up into a fun, engaging, experience that you can play how you want to.At $15, this is a game that offers just as much and playtime as games which cost two or three times as much, and it’s one that I highly recommend.Happy hunting,ShouldNotBe"

,Recommended,226700,12879634,"Posted: 10 November, 2014",all,Nukingfutz,"With all the negative reviews around i will now just take a moment to write my own.When the game came out without a decent Anti-cheat, and the game caught some popularity the game was overrun with hackers in all forms and trying to enjoy the game on a day to day basis was unbareable to say the least, although they are using a anti-cheat programmed by them selfs the community could witness themselves that their anti-cheat was improving, and succesfully removed thousands of accounts to be banned forever. They do not give warnings, they do NOT slap you on your fingers and tell you you shoudn't do that anymore - NO, They ban you.By advertising the game a couple of times on steam by reintroducing the game for a mere BUCKthe ""banned"" could just buy the game for as many copy's as they wanted to keep their hacking fix mett.Don't we all agree that the majority of people here giving bad reviews is because they started out joining games where in a time span of about 1-10minutes into it they faced a hacker that just didn't care much for his/her account and shot you, losing most of your well earned gear scatterd on the ground? Well i agree, there is nothing more discouraging then seeing the same amount of hackers or even the same hackers in the same servers filling their Lockboxes with loot they managed to achieve that most of us would have to farm days or even weeks for.Personally with some tickets send by friends and myself and watching streams where DEV's would show up and play or just say a few words i came to the conclusion that the operation behind Infestation was unproffesional to say the least.With all this negativity going for them, i see where people are coming from, and i won't even go into bugs/abuses or people having isseus getting into the game, and i do respect a bad review but lets keep the reviews to your personal expierience on the game and not someone that tried it for 30 minutes and decided that this wasn't a game for them without even seeing a second town.This game is enjoyable ones you know where your able to farm some items at, where the areas are that people like to go to pvp, and finally understand that this game actually is a pvp game, the mentality of people on this game is to just kill as many people as you can and farm their loot as your own, so you have something to put on when you die and respawn in again, now if that is something you don't like to do and would like to avoid pvp you shoudnt be around cities that are highly contested, and that also means you will have to give up on alot of loot laying around in those cities, and have to understand that your bound to come in contact with people that are still going to kill you. but hey... It's a zombie apocalypse.This game is essentially a minor threat zombie wise, meaning that zombies will not be one of your biggest problems, with an average melee weapon scatterd around the world you can easily dispose of a few zombies at ones without being hit, but take in consideration that the super zombie is one you should not take lightly and should not try to melee. this is one you should counter with a few magazines of ammunition on you, but you will easily find out where you will or will not encounter him, this still to this day is something i would have liked to see improved as every game out there - And this one isn't any diffrent - should make it harder as i see it as a core mechanic.This is a game where i personally find that your always on high alert, whenever your inside or outside the perimeter of a town you always have a feeling of being watched and that you could die at any given second trying to farm your gear from scratch and its satisfying when you do progress in terms of items. And actually fighting with your well earned gear makes you think twice about ""going for that easy kill"" because you can lose it as fast as you found it. the anticipation of fighting someone for me in this game was in most cases more enjoyable then actually having to fight someone, and especially whenever your playing with a group of friends that take the game just as seriously.For me this is a game that has a long way to go in many ways, but still is enjoyable to play if you can look around the bad reputation it already has and make it your own expierience. i would rate this game a 6/10. and actually an 7/10 if they actually manage to remove most of the hackers which they are working on.If you would consider buying this game i suggest you wait a little while longer untill december since they announced a ""new beginning"" where ""alot"" of things will be changed.In the meantime go to Twitch.tv and watch some streamers play the game to get a general idea what goes on in the game, and if it is something your interrested in.Roy."

I have really enjoyed this game, it's really fun to play with friends.The map is absolutley great, It feels like you are in a zombie apacolypse. It can take ages to walk from city to city becuse the map is so big.Most of these reviews on Steam is not true. I had no problems register my account or anything.This game IS playable and enjoyful. But there is many issues though..   I'm going to list the good things and the bad things to make it simple, and hopefully the developers will take a look at it..GOOD THINGS:The Map -  The map is well made, and really big.Graphics - Even on Low the graphics is great.Weapons -  Its not that hard to find any melee weapons.  If you dont find any weapons, you can use your hands.Many sorts of fire weapons in this game aswell..Supplies - Many supplies to find, and not that hard to find any.Clan - Be able to create a clan.  :)And many more!BAD THINGS:Hackers -  Waay to many hackers in this game.  Fix a better Anti Cheat system!Special infected -  I have only seen one special infected. But this is what destroys a zombie game. Me and my friend shot out all our ammo on one. He did not die.  Delete that.Vehicles - They need to be improved.  Driving is very buggy.Characters - More faces, clothes, hair styles, etc..  to select.Bleeding -  If you start bleeding and you are not close to any loot place, you are dead.  Make bandages spawn at more places. Or add that you can create your own by ripping your shirt or something like that.  Fix that.I recomend this game if you want a good zombie game. It may be many hackers out there, but its really enjoyable."

I've never personally had issues with hackers, I suppose I was just lucky to avoid them all. :PThis game also gets my recommendation for giving my group and I something to adapt to.

,Recommended,226700,12962664,"Posted: 15 November, 2014",all,PICKLE RIIIIIIIIIICK©,"To start off, you're reading a review of someone who had 1,000+ hours on this game outside of Steam. I was not paid to write this review and I received no compencompensation from anyone, in any way.This is purely a personal review of the game.Lets begin with the story and theme of the game:Just like other zombie survivals. You're in Colorado trying to survive a zombie apoloclypse. You can rank up from within the server and become bandits, or thugs, or police, sheriffs, and of the like. You can team up with friends or go solo and kill everyone on site. You pick up items along the way (mele weapons, firearms, attachments, food/water, bandages, armour, cosmetics, ect.)  and must feed yourself and keep yourself hydrated if you wish to survive. You also must keep yourself healthy and bandaged; free of disease and broken limb. The game has a slow day/night cycle. It also has ""safe zones"" where you are safe from zombie and other player alike.Just to point out some things:I do agree that, upon launch, naming this game WarZ was a rude move. But other than being ""rude"" they haven't broken any copyright laws, and have acted completely within their rights as game devs.The microtransaction system is EXTREMELY fair. They do not sell guns,  they completely removed the GC system, and replaced all buyable items to be purchased with money dropped off zombies.This game is not pay-to-win at all. I have had just as much luck surviving in this game on days when I purchace nothing from the marketplace from days when I do. Currently, I am playing a character that used nothing from the marketplace, and during this session I have had one of the biggest global item inventories out of any player i know.I don't notice any bugs that affect my gameplay, or at least it's been a few months since I have. Any important bug that I've noticed seems to have been patched at one point or another.I cannot recall the last time I've SEEN a hacker or cheater in my game. That does not mean that there are not any (there are hackers in most multiplayer server games) but I certainly have seen Hammerpoint's cheat-detection system find and ban many wrongdoers. I have never heard or known anyone playing the game legitly getting banned by this system to date, even though it may or may not have happened.The overall havoc that hackers can cause is much more dramatic on the ARMA engine.. In DayZ, hackers can teleport all players, including the host, 1000ft into the air, and laugh as everyone falls to their death. In DayZ, hackers can spawn 100 zombies on you at random. All games have cheaters. Infestation: Survivor Stories isn't a special case.The developers are good people! They always respond to posts on the forums, and Russiankaliber/Artemisknives stream as they work on the game; they literally respond to user input in real time. I've even had Segery Titov respond to many of my forum topics.Now to put some things into perspective for you:Infestation: Survivor Stories devs need money to improve their product. Hammerpoint funds over 500 dedicated servers. In USA, Europe, Russia, and Brazil alone.How many official servers does DayZ host?5.Am I attempting to exclaim that one game is better, or worse than the other? Not at all; they are two completely different games.The only way someone could possibly think this video game is a bad game, is because the gaming community and other 'sheeple' tell you that ""this is what you are supposed to think, don't even bother playing the game"".Just like how people are SUPPOSED to think DayZ is a great game. Or how you are SUPPOSED to think Pulp Fiction is a great movie. Both are good, but neither are as good as everyone are TOLD to believe. Sheeple just set guidelines of what you are supposed to like/dislike, and unfortunately many others follow.To date, Hammerpoint has never tried to 'sue' someone for 'asking for a refund'.  Trust me, I'm not exaggerating. There is nothing suggesting a hammer-point lawsuit. Sure, people have asked for refunds, but very few recieved them (they were all for legitimate reasons).These ""Noob"" developers, as I sometimes hear them be called, seem lightyears more talented than other devs. For example, the somewhat clunky developers over at Bohemia Interactive, who don't even know how to implement dropping items on the floor correctly.. Or jumping over a fence.. Or switching weapons....Is one game better or worse than the other? Absolutely not, and I'm not implying that. I'm meerly pointing out that all games have bugs, and this game isn't 'the only one'.If gamers were given Infestation: Survivor Stories in a blind study at it's current release, and were told it was something completely different than that of what it is, my opinion is that they would think it was actually a good game.The game is really good for people who do well with survival-type games, and who are fine with spending a while to learn the ropes. Caution: there may or may not be people better than you on your server, and you may or may not be visited by some random bad luck occasionally.Oh, and it also REALLY helps if you, oh, you know, play it and see for yourself for a bit.Do I reccomend this game? Or naw?Unfortunately, it's extremely easy to pass judegment on something you don't understand﻿. I don't think Infestation: Survivor Stories is perfect yet. But its nowhere even CLOSE to being ""Terrible"" like everyone says. I do understand this game, and I do reccomend it!"

It's lots of fun and very addictive. It actually runs, plays, looks and sounds great. In fact when compared to other games of this type its offers the most functionality, the least bugs and at the lowest price. So if your interested make sure your hardware exceeds the minimum hardware requirements and preferably the recommended hardware requirements and that your box is a desktop with at least 8 gb of ram. Then go watch some gameplay to make sure that you like this type of game and then head on over to the wiki to learn how to play the game and finally wait for one of their many sales, where you can pick it up for as little as $1. And if you do buy it make sure you join one of the many free password protected private servers where there is an admin that removes problem players and enjoy!"

Because me dying and losing all the stuff I was finding for about 2 hours was really cheating right?

They said there was nothing they could do to unban my account, and I said really? Well that's dumb because I didn't cheat, if you guys aren't going to unban a legit player, I would like my money back, so I didn't just waste my hard earned money on nothing.And they said, I'm not kidding. ""We can do nothing to unban your account, so stop sending support tickets. We are NOT looking into this anymore. Stop contacting us we are not going to help you"". So you tell me if these people are bad with thier  customers or not, personally, this is the worst service I've ever had, and I'm not very pleased. But I guess I'm not getting back on to stream this but whatever lol.Now to the game, the gameplay was alright, looking around to people is the worst threat, it was really easy to get stuff, to go there, take stuff, wait for new stuff to respawn, take that. Zombies looks stupid as crap, but I thought it was a bit funny. The game was about a 6 or a 7 out of 10 for me, but after that service, I give it a 2/10 and highly do not recommend it.

I wouldn't play this game even if it was free. There's a million different reasons, be it the community always calling each other hackers, people who are actually hackers, or the system where dying kills your character, gives them an hour long respawn timer, and starts you off with less loot than when you initally made your character, this game just found a way to fall over and flail on the ground. I initially bought it because it was only 2.50$ during the steam summer sale, and I figured a zombie survival sim could be fun. However, what I was met with was the impossible task of avoiding every other player while trying to loot buildings, beat zombies to death with my flashlight, and try and not starve to death.

However for some reason here lately (27MAR2013) they have been putting out patches almost every 2-3 weeks. So I'm happy in that regard. Mostly their patches have to do with their servers but they are also adding some new content to the game.

They dont make it easy to find good weapons so you have to work with what you find.3. PVP is brutal. Like it's really difficult to find a person who won't kill you for the the possibility that you might have something good for them to steal.4.The last several changes made to the game have all been for the better with nothing bad coming from it. (except the ♥♥♥♥ing super zombie that's impossible to kill)5. More than one way to die. You can die from getting hit too much, Bleeding out, infection, and from hunger and thirst.Bad points1. Moving across the map takes a good half hour. Would be nice if the characters could move just a little faster.2. Zombies are concentrated in certian areas. Would be nice if they could move around the map thus making it more challenging.3. The patches and updates take a long time which i get, the game isnt to popular yet so not many people working on it.

My only concern with this game is that it can get extremely repetative and frustrating when you've spent hours and hours getting loot and someone a million miles away who's using an aim hack just pops one in your head, not to mention  the company.

I would say the AI wasn't too bad for the zombies, But the mechanics and system just don't work out that well. When you play, most of the time it's just walking around just trying to find soda or food before you die and also trying to get past some bugs that offenly occur.

Large enough landscapes to ensure trekking from one location to another is an adventure in and of its self, sometimes miles of open terrain peppered with occasional zombies. That's where the gameplay takes off, deciding whether or not to risk killing the zombies for their random loot, which is nothing most of the time, or simply sneak by to gain access to more promising locations such as camp grounds, hotels, various stores or even a wilderness resort. All of which are filled with zombies, and taking on more than one can easily result in your very dissapointing death. Only to loose all your previous progress and start anew, though there are options to pool your resources in safe areas around the map. Your biggest threat though is other players, some may be friendly, but most of the time they will kill you without a moments notice just to steal your stuff. Weapons are a must, that Katana you found might be fun now, but find a firearm and you become god. As long as you have ammo for it that is, and don't fire it near largly populated areas or you will attract many more zombies than you can handle. Basically guns are for robbing other players or that far too often moment when you need kill or be killed in an instant. Good game? Not really. Fun? Can be. Replayable? Many hours can be sunken into this game every time you log in, good or bad is decided on that play session."

I bought it for a laugh when it was on sale.Basically the developers are hilariously dishonest and thought they could not only try and cash in on the success of DayZ, but actually have the cheek to say their game was in developement first. Despite the fact there is no evidence to support this.Also have a dig around on the internet and you will find so called early Alpha footage that clearly used the Crytek engine, which obviously this game doesn't. Plus be aware the devs have a history of banning people for no good reason, which you could consider bad if it was just some cheap game and not one people have actually spent money on buying in game items for.Another thing is if you purchase in game items you have to remember that a lot of them are lost when you die, which in itself is ok(ish) - however this game has had a blatant problem with hackers since beta so you can pay for and lose items because someone didn't get enough attention at home and decided they need to cheat to kill you.Gameplay wise: Graphics are very dated, the environment is really bland and the zombies are glitchy to the point they make either the DayZ mod or DayZ SA zombies(whichever you think are worse) look like they are working fine.I played this for about an hour but it was boring and glitchy. IF you don't want to believe me that this game is really awful fine, but I would recommend you buy it on sale to minimise the amount of money you waste.Do yourself a favour and buy any number of better zombie games on the market. Project Zomboid or any number of the indie zombie games in developement spring to mind.

I absolutely adore zombies, anything with a zombie in it usually draws my attention sooner or later, but Infestation: Survivor Stories is one of those games that make you question why you even bought it in the first place. Infestation is basically a pay-to-play game in a sense that if you don't use real-world money to purchase cthulu-powered gear you are basically target practice for those that do.Infestation was actually the first MMO I've played and because of Infestation, has turned me away from them forever. In the lackluster valley in colorado the game takes place in, you would be extemely lucky to meet a person who isn't immedeatly willing to blow your face of with a shotgun just to search your ravaged corpse for loot.Apart from the excessively violent player base the zombies prove little to no threat at all. Taking on a single walking corpse is simple. Hold the left mouse button until it falls over. When faced with more, just back up while holding it, rinse and repeat. In all Infestation : Survivor Stories is definately a game that should be avoided, and if you were like me and mindlessly bought the game without thinking, youshould understand the overwhelming buyer's remorse that comes with this little half-baked idea of a zombie apocalypse."

An excess of micro transactions that give huge advantages to players that allow them to completely crush new players without any chance of recovery is all too common in this game. The rarity of supplies and weaponry leaves people running around endlessly until they are shot by people guarding some of the few caches of supplies, only to start the entire process all over again. The entirety of the gameplay basically screams, ""BUY FROM THE STORE"", and once you do that, THEN you will start to notice all of the terrible bugs, graphical glitches, and just confusing AI behavior, not to mention the fact that your gameplay will now consist of nothing but searching for players to kill. Don't dare waste your money on this game, in fact, don't waste your time on it even if by some miracle it becomes free to play."

Whilst it has a lot of potential, it has some major drawbacks which after only a few hours of playing have left me feeling like I wasted $15 USD. Firstly the fact that none of the vehicles are repairable or driveable. The Zombies are overly aggressive and cannot be outrun in the open. This combined with the fact that not all buildings can be entered means the game becomes very much about ground level savaging.The zombie combat is also a joke. I shouldn’t have to hit a zombie 15 times with a baseball bat to kill it no matter where i hit it! it’s just un-realistic. I could live with the zombie difficulty if I could put them down quicker with melee weapons, however it makes the game near impossible unless your equipped with firearms and plenty of ammo, both of which are scarce in the game.I would therefore not recommend this game to my friends and can’t see myself playing this game in the future unless significant updates make it more playable.I guess it’s just another Zombie Apocalypse wanabe that falls desperately short of other games in its class.:("

The game being pulled quickly from Steam upon its initial release should have been enough to convince me to mot buy into the developer's and their attempt at this genre, but when it re-released I thought I would give them a chance to redeem themselves. That was a mistake. Even if you don't mind the abundance of hacking through the use of view bots, aim bots and the abuse of game glitches, there still lies the fact that this game was created in a way to force you to give in and spend your real world money. I can overlook many of the pay-to-win aspects if the game would have just let me play and enjoy what little there was to enjoy, but that was ruined once i encountered my first death in which I was prompted to wait an hour to respawn or create a new character. I went along with it and created a new character, which you can have a max of five. I soon found myself with all characters dead (due to the high level of individuals hacking to win) and being prompt to use the game GC to buy my wat into a respawn lor wait for the remainder of the spawn timer. This is what killed the experience for me. I can look past people spending real world money for better weapons or gear, but if I am expected to pay money just to respawn faster than the hour time limit set then you can consider the game a complete failure. This is not developers creating games because they love gaming or to advance the industry with their own style and spin on a genre; this is developers wanting to get as much as they can out of their customers and community and move on with the proceeds. I wish it wasn't this way but for the devs formerly known as HammerPoint, it is."

There are some areas of improvement overall - 7.5/10The gear spawns and drop was improved and it's much easier to find weapons. - 8.5/10The Travel aspect is pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥... Takes for ever to go from location to location - 5/10The Food and Hunger drops pretty fast so finding food is non-stop. even if it's up graded Not to mention your Stam runs out pretty quick as well. 5.5/10Repairing Items cost In Game money which when it drops isn't alot. You have to buy Game Currencyjust to be able to repair items or buy ammo.. ( ammo can be found along with weapons though )It's kind of a Pay to win. but the cost isn't that crazy. 7/10The over all aspect of Infestation aka War Z is pretty good... Like most MMOs and Survival games it has it's issues but it's worth the 15$ to buy plus the 10$ to buy game currency wouldn't hurt. It's enjoyable and when you're in a group it's even more fun. Can lose track of time playing that is for sure.Overall I'd rate it 8/10 Survival game I like it more that Day Z.... Day Z has to many actions and commands and finding items to survive is a pain.

They have even buffed the loot so that survival is the last thing you need to worry about.Point 2.

It really is a scam that has tried to outdo DayZ, or at least piggyback on it's success.DayZ is a difficult game, this one seems nigh on impossible unless you spend your own money buying guns etc in game. Which to me, at least, is a complete contradiction to what a   zombie apocalypse survival game is about!Hammerpoint really have dug their own game by releasing this ridiculous abortion. There's pretty much nothing good I can say about it. The pictures make it look like it could be good, but don't be suckered in, it's not!!It runs ok nowadays it would seem, I've played it for about an hour in total (& never managed to stay alive for longer than 10mins...) & I've never been kicked or glitched at all.I bought it for £2.74 on a steam weekend offer, just for curiosity's sake. This game should be free. I don't think I've ever seen an overpriced P2W as much as this. I just feel sorry for anyone who payed the original asking price of £20 for it! I actually feel angry Hammerpoint have my £2.74 in their pocket...I'm hoping it may be more enjoyable/possible to play with friends but as it stands, this is terrible...At this point, I'd rather be forced to have violent intercourse with a baby meerkat & have photo's of it shown at every family xmas than buy this game. But as I've already bought it, I guess I'll just wait an hour for my character to revive & try again...First impressions - a very literal & justified 0/10"

I had been trapped by the Game Dev's menu, I could not click Quit (or any other options for that matter). I was trapped, trapped in a world where flashlights and zombies do not mix. Trapped in a world where a player in a Bunny mask had to kill the zombie for me because my pathetic display of flashlight hitting was so embarrasing for them. Trapped in a world where I could walk past zombies.

The survivability would make this game extremely fun if you actually had a chance from the beginning. The game spawns you miles away from a town, so don't expect to have more than half of hunger or thirst by the time you get there, and IF you're lucky, you'll come across 1 can of soda or water, just enough to quench your thirst as you finish looking through the other houses in the town, which will likely have some pretty useless and unlikely items to scavenge. Alongside that, the people in this game are just♥♥♥♥♥holes. You'll likely get shot dead for just being seen by another player, have your corpse looted, and then YAY FUN GAMETIME NOW I GET TO WAIT FOR A REVIVE TIMER TO RUN OUT BEFORE I CAN PLAY AGAIN. There are so many things this game could've done different, and it would've been ""The Last of Us"" meets ""Unturned"", but looking at the marketplace I can see this game was more about injecting that capitalistic marketplace mentality than making a game that doesnt make me wanna throw my computer at a wall.

The game can be quite fun at times though but when your a new player this game is very unfriendly especially because of the pvp aspect. New players really need a server without pvp for the first few days they play so they get an understanding of how to survive and raid bases etc before being thrown against pvp'ers. Or atleast watch a handful of youtube videos of base raids beforehand to learn tricks of getting around without dying in them. At safe zones (red circle in 4 spots on map) you can deposit items into the vault to share with all characters atleast on your account.

Of course it didn't the game was still pretty bad another few months or so and I came back to find an update. New Launcher some vehicles and the hackers just got bored so now playable not good but playable all in all not worth $15 maybe for $7.50 I could recommend but for now ill recommend only if it was on sale for 50% off and even then its still hard. My final thoughts are not recommended but not a complete waste of money in its current state still not a wise investment though.Cons:- Poor Development- Terrible Anti Cheat- Overpriced for its rating and gameplay- An ocasional glitch that will kill you- Super Zombies (-_-)  [Dumb feature all together they give great loot but are nearly impossible to kill for even moderately equipped players and its a game breaker in its own where all of the good loot is theyre found so if your new and want to gear up u cant because unless you feel like crawling they will find and kill you the can run faster so noobs cant escape they take full 30 round clips to the face and can hear u walking from around 20 meters away.- Great time waster, literally you will waste 20 to 30 minutes running along a barren road to get to a new area.Pros:- Graphically appealing could use a few model and texture touch ups here and there mostly in the zombies- Now that hackers are mostly gone its playable.- Community that still plays is pretty friendly."

There are still some issues in the game such as zombies being able to climb up vehicles & you getting kicked from server if you sprint & jump off a vehicle, trach can, sandbag, or building. The prices in the game for items were cheaper when the game 1st came out, and then it has been increasing ever since. For example, when I 1st purchased Personal Lockers, they were 300 GC back when the game 1st came out & was still in beta, and then it increased to over 1,500 GC which is over $10 in real money. There was no warning or explanation of why the increase in prices. This is just one of the many strange activities in the game. If you climb in the vehicle on the driver side you get kicked from game. It happened to 2 other players who played with me. The game is still very buggy. There are a lot of hackers who use aimbots, floating hackers, god mode, & ESP (they can see you far away). Players are also kicked by punkbuster for some kind of script error too. It also took almost 1 year before vehicles were brought into the game as promised. There are a lot of things that were promised & still have not been completed. My final assessment is that the staff behind this game got such bad reps about this game from the media & gamers that they are now just trying to get what little money they can from the players now. There is currently about 12,000 players only playing the game now. Regarding the game trouble shooting support & account support from the staff, it is non existence. Very poor planning & setup here. If you want to reset your password, the link brings you to a blank page. It has happened to thousands of players. These folks who designed & made this game had a great idea, but it was a complete mess. Hopefully, nothing like this is ever sold to the public again."

A mix of DayZ (with better graphics) with State of Decay, A zombie game you actually feel like playing during ingame night time!I still remember with joy the breathtaking experience in entering a Parking Building at night to escape the zombies, where I could just explore the whole building after I managed to lose them, that was my first ingame experience, after that during the same night I dared searching the streets only to find several other buildings equally spatial, and an entire Stadium! Now I am not afraid of using my gun to fend off the zombies, and hear hear - zombies drop loot! And it is only in beta!I hope they give the same treatment to all buildings, and allow transactions with the shops otherwise it will be really hard to get soem essentials in a crowded server, since the ingame stores do not allow you to sell or trade stuff you get.Hopefully you may trade with other players. But really well thought through game. Be careful however because some are thugs, and there are even some assassins.I also love that all official servers (and there are a good number of them for starters)  have 100 player slots.There is also a vault where you can gather resources. Cash seems to depend on server. Some drop it as loot, others don't.I can't wait to have enough material to build a base.It runs smooth, loads fast, and all the gear I got was from killing zombies and roaming the streets. I HIGHLY recommend it. It is even the first time (as far as I recall) that I wrote a recommendation.Kudos to the team building it, they are very keen on details and oh boye, the stadium! With parking lot and everything! That was just the cherry on the top. (althoght I was really impressed by the several floors parking building, I have not yet explored some of the other buildings like a skyscraper I just realised had rooms on the several floors.

First of all, whenever your character dies (which will be often when considering the zombies that can walk through structures) you must wait out a certain period of time before creating a new one and moving on. As if this wasnt bad enough, all of your items are deleted. This may seem trivial, but it also includes the ""premium"" items that are purchased from the ingame shop with REAL MONEY.  If you are suckered into buying a cosmetic item or a premium weapon, and you are shot down by another player, you can kiss that money goodbye.My only regret was not refunding this game months ago.EDIT: I forgot to meantion that the Devs lied about several updates that never came.

,Recommended,226700,11440218,"Posted: 27 July, 2014",all,Harty,"This game may have been judged a lot because its similarities with Dayz and the name change. However, the game is really different from the Dayz game and stands out on its own.I go against all over high critics that gave this game a terrible review because they was unable to see it as a different game to Dayz.The game is Beautifully designed and is one of the best graphic looking game for this genre. Their is a wide range of weapons in the game that can suit every user from close combat shotguns to far away snipers. however, the guns need to be better balanced to make them more accurate The game has taken the best approach to melee weapons i have seen, unlike dayz where melee items are rarely found or even effective. Infestation has made it easier for new players a chance to survive by having items that can be used to take down zombies, but without over powering the weapons to be better choice than a gun. The game AI runs alot smoother than other games available with a lot less glitches cause by tracking and animation issues.The other players can be aggessive, but with the game built in promotion level you can see if they are more likely to be a threat to you. The promotion levels also take in what type of players the person has killed.However, the main downside which is the same for many games such as rust and dayz is hackers. The is no worst pain for a player than to be killed by a player that has hacked through a wall.Therefore, if you are looking for a great game that is very friendly to new users to genre. This is the game for you. remember every game has it's issues."

76561198042298124,Recommended,226700,15246332,"Posted: 6 April, 2015",all,FFSWolfie5,"PROS:+It's another zombie survival game with a few RPG elements tossed in. (I don't really get tired of this genre so to some of you this may be a con.)+There are multiple characters you can use, so if one dies, you have four more.+Your characters can level up by gaining experience from killing zombies and other players. As you level, you can take perks that make you starve slower, do more damage, etc. If a character dies, they stay down 20 minutes or so then they can respawn. The gear on that character stays gone HOWEVER having another character nearby increases your odds of retrieving that gear.+Reputation system! It doesn't do much, but it's great for beginners who aren't sure if they can trust another player. Red icon=someone who's likely going to kill you for the juice box in your backpack. Bright, shining blue icon of a holy angel? They can be trusted.+I really appreciate the vault system they have going in this game. You can take your stuff back to a safe zone and drop it off, then go running out into town dressed as a noob with beginner-tier gear. Thus leaving your most valuable PVP stuff stashed away at a vault that you can shift between characters. This allows you to have one or two mules to gather food, weapons and armor for your main characters.+Messages in a bottle. If you wanna RP or just leave some weird note behind for other people to find, they sell those in the store. You can also find them randomly on the ground.+Missions, I like this addition a LOT. They have missions that can encourage cooperation, like using a medkit on another player who is not your friend to get bonus XP and reputation. They have a decent bit of variety although I never did the demilitarization ones. Sorry, it's a zombie apocalypse full of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ people, I'm keeping my guns.+Out of game store. Need to buy attachments, food, medical supplies or melee weapons? Maybe armor? The store has a lot of useful stuff... (-)If you have the in-game or premium currency and can afford it. Most of the decent items will cost an arm and a leg. Oh, there's also no actual guns in the store last time I checked, just ammo.CONS:-Zombie hit detection gets a little wonky, sometimes you're right up against a zombie in a melee fight with the bugger and it can't hit you. Other times you're six or seven feet away and they CLEARLY miss you, only to cut you open, inflict you with a bleed, and kill you. :/-Other players are jerks. It happens in every survival game, if they aren't a clanmate or one of your AFK/(IRL) friends, they can't be trusted. You'll also find a lot of locked safes in areas where players frequently server-hop for loot. If you're in one of those places, you're probably going to get shot... A lot.-PREMIUM CURRECNY, I understand this mechanic in FTP games to help them make money so they can keep doing what they're doing and developing the game. But I bought this game back in Beta, before it was on steam. A friend of mine got founder and had to buy it again during the changeover to steam. (+) A friend of mine argues that if he still enjoys playing the game several months later then there isn't much harm in throwing an extra few bucks at the game now and then which I can agree with. (-) BUT you get more premium currency per dollar spent (and it shows you on a slider) to try to get you to blow more money than you may have initially told yourself you were going to spend.-Steam changeover. This♥♥♥♥♥♥was handled poorly and made a lot of my friends quit the game. I couldn't transfer my account for the life of me and ended up buying the game a second time. (Which I didn't entirely mind because I got it on sale and didn't lose too much stuff from my main account but I guess i'm still a little sore about it since I mentioned it as a con of the game.)-APPARENTLY I'M A SUSPICIOUS ♥♥♥♥ING INDIVIDUAL. Every other time I try to log on to the server so I can start playing, my account is locked due to suspicious activity. I move around a lot so I understand they're concerned for my safety, but I'm getting sick and ♥♥♥♥ing tired of changing my ♥♥♥♥ing password.-HACKERS. They implemented an automated system that bans hackers constantly and it puts global messages across the servers as it does so, but that doesn't seem to stop them from popping up like weeds. It has gotten better, but I'd like to just see them gone.OVERALL: 6.5/10 Buy the game.I jumped into this game a long ♥♥♥♥ing time ago when it was a truly bad game. But the devs worked hard on it. I saw it go through so many stages of improvment and I am genuinely impressed by the amount of effort put into the betterment of this game. With everything out on the table, I'm not reviewing this game as harshly as I thought I would. I do have a lot of fond memories playing this game with my clannies, running around what used to be a miniscule map, hiding inside a glitched rock and shooting bandits responding to the cries of ""I'm a noob I need help."" While it may still have its issues, it is a good game, it gets worked on, and I still like it and play it."

It has potential, but I've been playing it since before it was pulled from steam.. so I feel like the potential hasn't really  been reached for.The zombies are not overly hard to deal with, I'd like to see more of them and with greater intelligence. They can be a threat in numbers, but when you 1v1 them you just mash the mouse.Players are usually dinks. 9/10 times the people I bump into think its more fun to kill a lootless freshspawn than work with me. For this reason I have hardly been able to get beyond spawn points. Just before writing this I literally spawned into a container where a person was waiting, and he killed me. What did I have? A flashlight. Congradulations, buddy, its only function is to hold batteries.The 1/10 times you bump into a player it can be fun, but you still usually wind up getting murdered in 1 shot from no where. Because, on occasion, there are still hackers. I've been killed in places where I know there is no vantage point to view (corner of a room, prone under the window, nothing but sky visible through the windows).The new Caliwood map is much better in its design than Colorado, because of the grinding you have to do to walk to your friend if they spawn across the map.

He liked to be called Joey. He was a nice fellow, with a few close friends. The local ladies who saw him sometimes bowling at the local Bowl-o-Rama Bowling Alley said he was pleasant on the eyes. He was a nice guy to be around, and a very pleasant conversationalist. He knew all the right things to say, and never seemed to be on anyone's bad side. He never had a run in the with local police, and was very straight and narrow. He owned an auto parts store in town. the shop being one of only 2 auto places in town was profitable, leaving Joey to skip the 9 to 5 grind, and have plenty of free time to pursue more leisurly activities. Joey was American as apple pie, and loving life to the fullest. He did have a girlfriend, whom he had even asked to marry him recently. She gladly accepted. Joey's life seemed set.Joey was a good wholesome average man, with lots to live for. Which is why none of the rest of this makes sense...On the night of September 14th, 2012, Joey was last seen sitting outside of his 2 story home, on his steps. A neighbor recalls seeing Joey through her window across the street. Joey appeared to be shaking, wearing only what appeared to be a towel, shorts (possibly boxers), and no shoes on. He looked a mess. The neighbor went downstairs, and when she went out of her door to see if Joey was okay, he was gone. She went to his front door and rang the doorbell, but there was no answer.2 days later, Joey's body was found outside of town washed up in a riverbed.Police say there was no signs of foul play, and it appeared that he had commited suicide by jumping off a bridge located further upstream, breaking his neck on impact. None of this made sense. This man, whom was recently engaged and not in any trouble financially or otherwise, took his own life? This made no sense at all.Police searched his home and found no evidence of foul play. When they searched his den, the lights were flickering off and on, with a faint humming coming from a computer fan. The computer had been left on. Maybe there were clues here? One officer walked up to the computer desk, and touched the mouse enough to get the computer out of sleep mode. what he saw haunted him. A few seconds later, the computer monitor sparked, and then it shut off. It had died. As well as the computer with it.Haunted by what he had seen, officer Henry King mentioned none of this to other officers, and left what he had seen on the screen out of his report.4 days later, Henry King was found dead in his apartment. He had hung himself the night before.On his computer monitor it flickered off and on. Infestation: Survivor Stories. Scribbled on a notepad also on his desk, in almost illegible hand writing was a small message: ""Abandon all hope ye who enter here"""

I've been trying different approaches when it comes to that but it always end the same. Doesn't matter if I'm hidden or the person who shoots first. There simply is no way to beat a player who cheats (making them able to go full  auto and pretty much hit your head all the time meaning that your body armor doesn't matter).I've been questioning my ability as an FPS-player. But after yesterday I know it isn't that I am a bad player (former MLG-player in Halo 3 and usually in the top of the score list on most FPS-games that I've played), but that the community here stinks. Every now and then you stumble upon a fair player and those moments really shine. Trust me on this though; you will be gunned down by one of the many low-life cheaters that this game has and it will ruin all the fun for you and whoever you play this game with.I wish it wasn't this hard to find a good survival-game with no cheaters.

On that topic this game wants to take your money by making microtransactions like a f2p game, plus when you buy something it is not saved in your invintory forever, it drops as soon as you die, imagine buying 50$ worth of ammo and then being killed by a hacker 10 minutes later. On that side as far as the gameplay goes, zombies can only be killed by headshots which is pretty legit. the game makes you loot by stealthing around, and when you accidently startle an army of zomibes, you  can jump on a car and be invincible, fun right. when you get into the pvp area it would be nice to chat without loosing control, so they never put in a voice or voip chat till this very day. and all the players are the same they kill you even if you dont't have anything, so this game already has a trashed community full of people that would kill you for making themselves feel good, plus a 20min respawn timer. i honestly feel very bad for the people that bought this on release for a full 60$ my final rating is a 0/10i bought this for 2$ and already knew this was a bad game, i tried it and to try to get my 2$ out of itboy was i wrong about how bad this game is"

Does everything it can to make you pay more real money to continue playing. Buggy with on-going fixes that make the game buggier, causing things that were working to not work.Recommend Dead Island and/or How to Survive as better choices for a zombie killing experience, although these are not MMOs. At half price this game still isn't worth it.LONG REVIEW:I very much disliked this game for many of the reasons stated by other reviewers. I played for a number of hours with friends and it was the same repetitive, unsatisfying, nonsense the whole time. Just a lot of running around with the odd fight. I felt like I was training for a marathon rather than playing a zombie game - there is so much running around.Although it isn't terrible graphically, it is still substandard, which should be inexcusable by today's standards and potentials.Aimless gameplay and not-so-great graphics overtop of a buggy architecture that left me so bored that I wound up actively hating the experience. Life is too short to spend it running around for the amount of time this game has you do it.You pretty much have to spend real money to get anything at all out of this game, and it is simply not worth it.My recommendation - buy Dead Island instead. Or if you don't mind Diablo-style gameplay - get How to Survive. I know these are not MMOs, but Dead Island can be played Co-op, and both are just plain fun, far richer zombie killing experiences that pack in the action and do it with MUCH better graphically (I mean that in all ways)."

You start with almost nothing, making it impractical to be motivated to risk your life for some supplies, even if it takes killing 1 zombie you still will have to aviod it. The Zombies are so stupid, the system for making this game hard is that they have the zombies set so that it takes 9002 hits, and the aniamtion once you hit them is so terrible i almost cried, not because it is funny but rather how terrible of a whole game this is. I hate the combat, it is not enjoyable, exiting, or taxing to my skills, instead it is so hard it is aggrivating, it never gives you a chance.My final Point is that The community in this game is the worst, in my first experiance, in the chat box there was a 11 year old loser smack talking. Everyone was not even clever in the insusts. it was stupid and i lost 9003 brain cells. I Hate the community.So as you can see this game is A money pitt, with an criminal combat, and a Craphole of a community, This game is so bad that they should pay you to play it. I Highly to the highest degree beg you to never purchase the game.and a message to the developer next time make a game worth playing and it will be much more sucessful"

But that doesn't mean it isn't a good game. ISS is such a simple game that despite a lot of the problems, is a lot of fun. The graphics are good, but the game isn't really optimised well, causing severe FPS drops if your rig isn't very good. Gameplay is very pick-up-and-play, thrilling and often quite fast paced. The gameplay is a lot of fun, but one thing that often spoils it is the the sheer amount of hackers. Not ever have I seen a game before with as many hackers as this, it is probably the biggest downside to this game and is the reason I have stopped playing this game for weeks, even months, at a time. All that aside, if you can put up with the frequent deaths to hackers and are looking for a fast paced zombie survival game with loads of PvP, this is definitely your game.8/10"

,Not Recommended,226700,8023923,"Posted: 12 December, 2013",all,SCAARR,"I've tried to give this game a chance despite its unpopular reviews. However, most negative reviews are correct. The game is ridiculously frustrating for a number of reasons. First thing; its extremely time consuming but does not reward for time given. You would think that sneaking and fighting past a horde of zombies around a complex would reward you, however, many times I have found little to no drops in the area. This can give you a challenge and a more strategic approach to situations but it mostly leaves you with only one option, moving on. Second; this game is NOT single player friendly. Even if you manage to gather decent supplies you are normally killed without warning. This game almost REQUIRES assistance from other players, which is hardly ever given. Third; this game is oriented for you to spend real money. Which is ludicrous with a 20$ price tag. If you die and lose supplies, you are defenseless except with a flash light. Which takes a RIDICULOUS amount of time to kill even one zombie. Fourth; the servers suck. Joining a server is often time consuming only to boot you out later for various issues.To play devil's advocate there are a couple of positive points. Its graphics aren't terrible and the environment can be immersive. IF you do happen to have a party of friends to play with the game can be entertaining. Forming strategies to assault a rival group can be very rewarding.All in all, this game is awful. I rarely uninstall a game from my PC even if I don't really like it, but this was a first. I'd recommend people stick with the Day Z mod for ARMA. Which is what Infestation obviously stole their idea from."

Zombies never come at you one at a time, you will always agro a pack, and you will have to melee them down which is nearly impossible.Playerbase: From what I could see, it was mainly paranoid children.Upon joining my first server, it did not crash. Nor did the game crash after joining any server.  Zombies do not agro miles away like reviews claim. Infact they agro at a respectable distance, and mainly agro due to noise you are making by walking. This is typical of most zombie survivor games. The downside of this, unlike DayZ, is zombies are much more numbered. If you agro one, you are likely to agro more. Now seeing as a melee weapon takes 10-20 strikes to kill a zombie or 3-5 if you manage to hit them in the head, it's hard to take on more than one at a time. This leaves you almost forced to have a firearm. I did not have a hard time finding firearms ar all, just had a hard time finding ammo. It would see that ammo has to be purchased with cash, this cash drops from zombies randomly.  The ""cash"" can also be purchased with real life currency.  When you die, you do lose all your items, like DayZ, however you even lose items you may have paid real life currency for. I suggest NOT buying items with real money. Upon death, you will be returned to the character selections screen. You will have to wait 20min for your character to ""respawn"" or pay real life currency to instantly respawn. It is a very unpolished game which seems to be getting very little attention from it's Dev team.I would honestly suggest downloading another game like DayZ Standalone or Sate of Decay."

If nothing else to spare them from the accident I made.I was aware of this game before the name change (when it was called The War Z) and didn't like it. Unfortunately, I was unaware that a game could just change its name. So, when saw ""Infestation: Survivor Stories"" was on sale and read the ""About"" section I picked it up. I thought, ""The worst that could happen is that I don't like the game and I'm out a little money.""I regret that I was unaware of the ""Rebranding"". I regret that I didn't do something better with my money, like pay someone to punch me in the face. I regret that I had the install this game and have it run just so I could write this review in hopes of warning people off from this game.It is because of the many controversies present behind the scenes that I didn't want to buy this game. I don't want to support the people that made this by any meaning of the word. If I was aware of the rebranding, I would have avoided this game like it was a plague of zombies. At least until I got a blunt weapon, then I would have pummeled it until it was a red and green smear on the floor.Even excluding the various controversies that surround the company that produced it, as a game, by itself, it is horrible.If you want a post-apocalyptic-zombie-survival game I would recommend any other game on Steam that fits that criteria. It's not hard to find, and all of them are better than this crap.I hope Valve removes this game from the Steam store, again. That's right. Valve has removed this game from the Steam Store several times in the past, because of a variety of issues they were having with the games producers (all of which can be summarized by the statement ""The Executive Producer, Sergey Titov, was being an [bleep]"").I don't even care if I don't get a refund. I'm just embarassed that the game is in my inventory. I'm embarassed that my friends could look at my library and see this game here. I got ""Flora's Fruit Farm"" as part of a Square Enix Bundle and I would proudly wave that game as my banner if I could just delete this game from my list."

You cannot host a server privately and have to rent one from the devs. The entire thing is set up as a cash cow; you can create a character with a few customization options and a tiny backpack for free, but everything else (including the character backgrounds that allow you to start with better gear) costs cash.Not only that, you cannot host your own server. You must pay the developers to rent one. Plus, the community is mostly terrible: no one attempts to work together, and in most cases the first person you see will attempt to kill you without saying a word. When that happens, you lose your inventory, and that character is locked out for a full hour before it becomes playable. You can rotate between your five characters but there's little reason to do so when you just get killed every few minutes and have to start from scratch. Similar to the original DayZ, but the community is worse, and so is the gameplay. I severely regret purchasing this game."

The game is overly difficult due to the fact that they hit you from 20 yards away and seem to hear you when you're crawling 10 feet away from them, another issue is that in order to get anything ""Decent"" in this game you are almost forced to either buy All of the money ever to play this game, or you can play until your brain succumbs to weariness and you slam your face onto the keyboard and enjoy your nap, Finally the game just isn't fun I don't enjoy stabbing zombies with a power drill and I don't find it fun to find a decent gun, just to be killed by a zombie that glitched through the building to get to you.

What chance did I have? Any weapon you find you will eventually loose because of this and theres never just one of them. I've heard storys of when you do somehow make it to the safe zones, kit yourself out with real money, weapons, armour, food, health etc the moment you leave the compound theres ambush sites set up right outside with a bunch of players that wait there all day to nick your stuff and they rings true for trying to enter a safezone too.The players on this game are the biggest ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s in mutilplayer games you will ever meet.

I still cannot believe I put 100 hours into this piece of trash game. When this game first came out it was an incredible let down. However, over 6 months - 6 MONTHS - later, the game was countinuosly getting updates. It was promising, until the company released another map, that looked promising, but still again, the screenshots looked better than the actual gameplay. DO NOT, I REPEAT DO NOT TRUST THIS COMPANY WHATSOEVER. They are like a cheap ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ that you pick up one night on the corner and you're thinking to yourself, this girl looks so ♥♥♥♥ing hot and I'm going to have a fun time, until, you're actually ♥♥♥♥ing her. This is point where you are regretting every single moment. Once again I return to my thesis, this game has no structure whatsoever, nothing. It is so boring and the player's movements and stances are clunky and wacky. The sounds suck♥♥♥♥♥ the zombies are ridiculously powerful, it's hard to find a great gun and decent food and water. The only real way you can have fun on this game, is if you buy a premium account. Where you have access to premiuim servers. Here, you have 2x more loot, 2x more experience 10x less players. Also, you get to transfer your GC - the money you get when you put actual money in to the game - to ingame money, so, you can buy as much items as you want to overpower the next player you see. This game came out as a sandbox SURVIVAL, not a sandbox PLAYER VS. PLAYER. I absolutely recommend anyone who is reading this review to NOT buy this game.P.S.: Weapons do not classify as 'Items', they're put into another category called, Weapons. Just like vehicles aren't classified as 'Items'."

,Not Recommended,226700,21720246,"Posted: 8 March, 2016",all,Sciaphobia,"So I was flipping through available game channels on Twitch, and saw a game sharing a similar name and look to this one. I don't know what the relationship is, but it reminded me of this. A memory I had thought long buried.So first thing out of the way, I do not recommend the game. Second thing, I played this quite a while ago so I may not be as specific in my feedback (or as accurate, honestly) as you might like. In fact, I played the game before it was forced to change its name due to... copywright infringement, I think it was (not a good sign already). I'll do my best though, if for no other reason than to share what my lasting impression of the game was.So let's get right to it. What's wrong with the game, and why do I not recommend it? So I have a criteria I follow with my entertainment media in order to determine whether I believe a purchase was a good one or not. This criteria is pretty simple - if a game gives me an hour of entertainment (or more, obviously) for each dollar I spent on it, I consider it a successful purchase. You'll see I spent 24 hours in the game, so it can't have been THAT bad, right? Because I got it on sale it actually did meet my criteria, but I consider it a failure anyway.Why? Well. The game felt like it had a lot of potential, but it is hard to realize that potential in a system that is as sparsely populated as this one is. I wouldn't really be surprised if 20 of those 24 hours were spent walking around, trying to find something to DO. You don't start out with a weapon either, so if you DO find something to do but it requires that you have a weapon in order to do it... well, you just can't do it then. Better luck next time.Pros and Cons. Why both at once? Because whatever. That's how I am doing it this go around.To the best of my memory the graphics we fine, although not great.The controls were also fine.The game servers lagged a bit, which is the only thing that made the zombies actually dangerous.Guns and ammo are more rare than rain in Arizona. Luckily it's practically impossible to hit anything that's moving with them because of server lag anyway (this may have been cleared up by now, but I have my doubts).The community seemed relatively fine, but it was exceptionally small when I played, which really hurts games like this. I think with the server lag issues resolved, and a strong community, a lot of the game's shortcomings could be overlooked. But... the community was NOT strong when I played, and I'd be surprised if it was better now.Death is very unforgiving, causing you to lose all the items you were holding. That's normal for a game like this, but when it takes an hour to even find a gun at all (as likely as not with no bullets in it), losing it, especially due to lag, causes the game to be more tedious than fun.I actually found myself not using guns when I DID have them because ammo was so precious, and I didn't want to waste it.The game fosters a paranoid playstyle, but not because it's a horror game. Rather, it fosters that style because it is a horrible game. The two words DO share a lot of letters, and you may end up horrified, but that's about the extent of the similarity."

Please read on if you would like to know why, if not just heed my previous advice and do not be an ignorant buyer. This game originally came out as The WarZ around the same time as the DayZ mod became popular. It was rumoured to be an up-and-comer that would stop DayZ from ever being released. Due to lack of customization and painfully glitchy gameplay, it inevitably failed. In a desperate rebirth, and copyright issue with Max Brooke's World War Z, The WarZ became Infestation: Survivor Stories. The only obvious change was the title. The game, even when run on high end computers, tends to be too demanding to play smoothly. This results in a lot of lag regardless of your internet connection. Because of this, gamers playing infestation with special rigs tend to annhilate others mercilessly, turning the game into less of a zombie apocalypse into ""grab a gun and just hunt players for fun"". The revive time for your character has you breaking your zombie shredding constantly (not really shredding seeing as a chainsaw takes about 10 whacks to kill just one zombie). Then, after finally respawning, and hyped up to get revenge on your killer, you have to search for more weapons. In the process to get some good gear you will be killed about 10 more times (2 from zombies, 5 from legitimate players, and 3 from aimbotters) before you finally find a firearm. It might be a crossbow, a pistol, possibly an old world war 2 relic, or if you are really lucky a fully automatic AKM. You'll be elated at the sight of a chance to defend yourself only to have it crushed when some hacker rolls buy swinging a bigger stick and kills you. Back to square one... I honestly have tried playing this game with full attention, in a desperate (but hopeless) attempt to get my moneys worth, but alas those are just more hours I will never get back. I have tried multiple different strategies ranging from playing with a group of friends to avoiding all player contact but nothing seems to work in having fun with so many hackers and thugs playing. I have looked at multiple walkthroughs, guides, tips, and even the games wiki trying to pick up some edge that I can use to turn the game dynamic back in the honest ""just want to play for awhile without rage"" player's favor, but the strategies I have found to date have been interrupted by the aforementioned jerks. If I were you, I would not waste my money on a crude game whose only purpose is to steal your money (initial purchase and subsequent in-game premium items) and instead would save up for better contenders. At this point, I am so tired and disappointed by this game, I don't want to try anymore to have fun with it. There are plenty of other games out there where fun is simply there to be had, where I won't need to put effort into them to seek the fun."
