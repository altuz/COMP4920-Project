,Recommended,226740,11960784,"Posted: 2 September, 2014",all,Alexspeed,"I think i should write at least a short thing about this game, because it truly deserves it =)Its a kind of ""Build your Adventure"" story game in which you raise your own monsterling from birth to adulthood. It involves quite some good reading and humor. The game gives you lots of choices, like ""save the monsterling - or eat it"", which in progress develop your character and the storyline.Besides the many small story bits, its not overly complex, but its very entertaining.The Achievements are fun to hunt down and you will need to play through the game several times to get them all. Generally the game has plenty of replayability with its varied small stories, so that is not too much of an issue. I played it several times over and still find new ones. A playthrough shouldn't take more than an hour i guess, maybe less.If i had to criticize something, then its probably that its not very long, but i guess that's the way the game was designed, its not meant to be a complex long thing, more something easy to play in between.And i would have loved to be able to design the looks my own monsterling, sadly the game doesn't give that option, i think its random how your monster will look like.Technically the game is solid, no bugs or anything that i would have to mention.Also i totally dig the artstyle, but thats personal preference =)It also has the best emoticons, so thanks for that.( :hee::ooh::hmm::blech::grr: - they dont work in this Review post )Conclusion: This is a very fun small charming game worth to be played =)"
,Not Recommended,226740,12871722,"Posted: 9 November, 2014",all,🌺🌸Futome🌸🌺,"It was fun! ...For the first run or two.Well that was upsetting. Monster Loves You! is a text, choose-your-own-adventure game where you start your life out as a newborn baby monster and you live your life up until your return to the slime vat pool or until you finish the game as an elder who transcended above death to decide what ulitimately happens between the humans and monsters when the inevitable conflict happens.You have 5 personality traits, Bravery, Cleverness, Ferocity, Honesty, and Kindness. You gain and use your traits to your advantage in situations that require them. This would be awesome if there was actually more situations that required that. Because more or less everything you do it a sure thing. It's pretty obvious if you're going to lose something or gain something from most interactions. I'll continue that shortly.You use these personality traits to your advantage to gain respect from other elders and monsters so you may be respected enough as an individual to transcend into becoming an elder on the day you are supposed to die. Then once you are an Elder, you must work to either build or sabotage human and monster relations in the coming days before the conflict of humans and monsters. It is this point I believe the story ends with the effort you put into this before the conflict.Everything about this game was really cool except that this game doesn't vary or switch up the story at all. By my second playthrough I already knew pathes and things I needed to say to reap the most (xyz) out of that ""adventure"" So I could get my stats high or close to maxed out as possible while getting tons of respect from the elders. I was hoping that after each death it'd be like a new life with new characters and new adventures. But I kept seeing the same thing over and over again already and it got really tedious and simply not fun. It immediately became apparent that i'd just start grinding to get medals for achievements. I don't care so much about the medals. It's nice to see new endings. But that's not the point of a game like Monster Love You! or at least shouldn't be circled around what the ending is going to be. The meat and soul of the game which is the time spent in each life stage is where you're spending most and pretty much all of your time as opposed to the scripted age-transistion stages. It was like I had a really amazing, fan-friggin-tastic sandwich, and in two playthroughs I felt like I was eating the same sandwich for months. I was so sick of it.Contining on that point is that you get really familiar with each adventure pretty easily, they're very distinct and memorable most of them. And the options listed make it very obvious which choice is going to get you the most points and the good stuff.I was investing in honesty and kindness to achieve renown for honesty and kindness in the game, but I knew the choices in the game so well and understood where I could get off chalk-free in two playthroughs I already knew where I could build ferocity without consequence. I had kindness and cleverness maxed, I had honesty about 86% up there and I had roughly 69% ferocity. I shouldn't be able to get my ferocity stat so high while striving to get honesty and kindness. Cleverness was just so easy to pick up. It made it super-easy to bend the end game to my will because I had such high stats overall I could make the story anything I wanted it to be. Therefore there was really no reason to keep playing the game. Because in two playthroughs I could understand the routes I need to take to get the most (xyz) and how to get the medals and other things.It as a really fun game my first two runs. After that, it just simply wasn't fun. Definitely wasn't worth the money I paid for it, I expected much more out of it after reading such nice reviews.Also continuing, from what i've heard in the game, sounds like the game has only 3 soundtracks in it. And that's just a big no-no. The art directive is okay. They could've worked harder in a lot of areas, but whatever. The humor in this game is great. But it's not funny after you read it the first time.Regardless, Monster Loves You! is a nice and funny and enjoyable game. But after the second playthrough or third, you realize you're just doing the same thing again and it's not fun. I was really hoping that my deaths in the game would have an influence on my next life (which I read this in a review, this was a lie or a fabrication of their beliefs of what's going on in the game) But it doesn't and that's when I realized I was going to just be doing the same thing over and over again.Overall, this game wasn't worth the money I paid for it, I bought it for about 4 dollars and I personally just wouldn't really recommend it at all to be honest. As I said, it's fun and it's nice. But I personally think you should keep that money for something nicer that pops up on the steam store or in a steam sale that you'd rather grab.Anyway, thank you for reading my review. I hope it helped you in your decision to purchase this game or not, have a good day."

You guide your monster through stages of its life, your actions determining your monster's attributes, such as ferocity, cleverness, and bravery.While each stage of life has multiple short adventures to take your monster on, they rarely influence each other, beyond some of them becoming easier depending on which 'stats' you've leveled up beforehand. It isn't until the latter of the game, which you may or may not reach due to your decisions in game, where you begin having an influence on anything beyond your monster village and the woods around it.Monster society is darkly humour- black comedy abounds. You meet many different fairytale creatures and have an opportunity to try and befriend or viciously murder and eat all of them. The soundtrack and visuals are bright and cartoonish, and fit perfectly.Each play-through will take you about twenty to thirty minutes, depending on how fast of a reader you are, and getting most of the endings is pretty intuitive.

The result is that everything you do feels important, and with too much to do in a single play-thru the replayability factor is somewhat high. However, the game isn't long and multiple play-thrus--once you understand the format--can be accomplished in rapid succession and the game peters out.Still, it has lovely graphics and makes for a few really fun rounds in a notably unique monster world and culture.

Each playthrough of the game you get a handful of scenerios to choose from to establish your monster's character and hopefully survive to the next stage.  Because the scenerios offered are randomized, and there are more scenerios offered at each stage than turns you take, every game will play out differently making each playthrough an unique story.  It's not the kind of game where you know how to get the next ending by simply altering one or two choices from one playthrough to the next.I have played through this title over and over and I never get tired of just trying one more time.  There are 14 ending achievements to try and get, but because of the variety and randomization of each playthough it can be hard to figure out how to get all of them.  This makes for a game that satisfies on the casual level (seeing what kind of story you will have on this playthrough) and it also offers goals for the more driven player (just how DO you get that next ending).For a game driven entirely on text, this one is quite entertaining!"

It has an surprisingly large amount of dialog and details and I was overall impressed by the quality of the game.There are 14 achievements in the game were each is awarded for one of the 14 outcomes of the game. This sadly makes the early parts of the games very repetitive since you need to do them 14 times at a minimum but probably many times more unless you do everything right every single time.

,Recommended,226740,22785964,"Posted: 3 May, 2016",all,HOTSHOT,"There is something special about Monster Loves You!Simple, but deceptively replayable. It's a choose-your-own-adventure type of game, starting you as a monsterling that was just born. With multiple stats (initially at zero), your actions will lead to the community respecting you (or not) and increasing statistical values about your personality (bravery, cleverness, etc.).This is simple but, again, rather adictive. After 6 hours and about 8 (?) playthroughs I'm still getting newer and newer stories as I go along, which adds the replay value of the game (besides the fact that it possesses 14(!!) ending, to my knowledge).Graphically it's just multiple backgrounds with no real animations (unless you click your monster avatar, which will make him jump and say weird♥♥♥♥♥♥xD), so to review graphics, I'd really review one thing:UI (INTERFACE)Nothing short of great. Buttons are clear, with something indicating what the story behind each clickable button may consist of. A scared monster face may lead to a story about investigating a human house, for example. Nothing more to say, really, informative, simple and slick, the UI excells in this adventure game unlike for of its genre.AUDIOWith no voice acting, that leads the music which is kind of a few tracks that repeat themselves. They are pretty good and chilling, suiting the happy and cute atmosphere the game transmits.STORYBarely got anything to say about it:You start -> You're born.Game ends -> Youshifted the course of the world, creating an endless war between monsters and humans, or united them into one civilization filled with compassion and honor between eachother. OR you simply died, recognized for the trait you leveled up the most (braveness for example).This allows for alot of replayability considering you like the style and the atmosphere of the game. Since it's pretty much YOUR story, relatability to the main character resides in you and only you. It's well done and the cuteness of your activities, monster reactions, UI design and drawinggive the game a MASSIVE boom of charm and interest to the player. This is precisely where you'll find the best part of the game. The juxtaposition of the charming style and the story make the game worth, in my opinion a purchase at any price equal or below its base one (9,99€).The emoticons are expensive as ♥♥♥♥, tho. Anyway, I digress. Game's fully worth it for it's uniqueness among the genre. A solid 8/10 for me!P.S: Kinda weird steam updated it's review system and forgot the much asked ""meh button"", the score system introduction and all that...The game is amazing and has nothing to do with said ""Meh"" button, but still... this review system still feels rather barebones and Valve sure has the potential to make this a great environment for a complex but useful review system (since any idiot can hop on Metacritic for example and bash a game they don't like, like Call of Duty (and that does happens to CoD, we all know it!)).Anyway, just my 2 cents..."

It is based around living the life of a monster from birth to death, but it doesn't go far enough with it.

,Not Recommended,226740,28417888,"Posted: 16 December, 2016",all,Dravvad,"""Monster Loves You!"" is literally a Choose Your Own Adventure text game, with some general background drawings. It's not the same as an exploration game where you punch in keywords or try to work your way around somewhere.The time it takes to complete the actual game is 30 to 40 minutes, depending on how fast you're picking options and reading. Technically, you can fly through it in approximately 15 minutes or less if you know what events and choices you want. Each achievement for the game is completing it with a new ending, and when you replay, the events don't change unless you trigger something specific at the first endgame point.If you care about getting the achievements, you can reuse saves as some guides explain. It really is not that worthwhile to replay it 14 full times because more than half of those times you'll be choosing the exact same actions.I thought the game looked a bit interesting in drawing style, hence why I got it. But it turns out that there really aren't that many different graphical screens. And most of the time, they're just shadowed out because of the text boxes, sitting on top of the screen for you to read and decide upon.Your monster has a set of stats that you can increase as you choose certain events, and the game's ending is determined essentially by those stats, as well as a few other endgame choices. No event until the ""final"" age event actually triggers the ending. Thus, the game fits an exact carbon-copy mold of the same general things happening over and over, which also adds to your boredom and the game's lack of fun replayability.Going through the adventure of the game was just really disappointing, as not many of the events are that exciting. The developer's claim of the 900+ choices is quite an exaggeration, since most events don't differ by much at all with their choices. And the fact that it's an extremely short story means that it doesn't require any investment or make you even care about what is happening."

We would learn a lot in how to get along with others and for that I have a positive view of Monster Loves You! For a parent, this is probably a good game to play with their children.But it is far too short to justify a $10 pricetag. There is simply not enough content to justify it.Another thing worth considering is that your actions, generally, provide few negative consequences. You would have to actively seek out the worst possible answer to even reach the worst endings within this game. There is simply no challenge, though in retrospect, that may have been the point.However, given the lack of content, this only serves to hurt the game instead of actually reinforcing the gaming experience, gaming being used very liberally in this situation.I really do like this game. I appreciated the variety in the scenarios and the writing was very cute. However, there is simply not enough to do in this game and the things to do don't provide any measure of challenge. I found myself with most of stats being maxed out without any active consideration towards any stat but one.It was honestly harder for me to not get both Human and Monster relationships up to 100%. It just seemed like this was too easy and even though I'm not expecting something difficult on the level of some other Steam games, it just felt like this game was handing everything to me.So, sure, buy this game and play it with your kids.

I didn't pay much attention to the reviews and just gave it a go.What you have here is a cute and charming choose your own adventure game, with pretty backgrounds and nice ambient music. However the entire gameplay consists of essentially multiple choice answers to various situations. You go through each stage of a monster's life, from being born, an adolesencent, an adult, and then you either dissolve and die or become an elder. When you're an elder you decide the fate of the monsters versus humans.Depending on your choices you gain points in personality traits, which you need for other decisions later in the game. Based on your personality and your choices you can get one of 14 endings. An average play should take about 40 minutes, as it did with me.It's a very charming little title, and if you know what you're getting, go ahead and buy it.

Each phase has ""mini adventures"" from which to choose and then options within the adventures.

There are 14 possible outcomes for the end game.  It takes about 10-15 hours of game play to achieve all 14 outcomes.My criticism is with the choices lacking materiality on the final outcome.  The choices cause the trait percentages to vary. Basically you get about 30 or so choices and find they lead to one final choice yielding your outcome - you could choose the same 30 adventures/same choices every play through, get to 80% in every trait and about 70% in respect.  (not that you'd do that, but you could and it would not restrict final outcome overly much at all other than neurosurgeon and modest legacy).Basically the choices at birth/child/teen just arent material enough.  They should cause the final outcomes to be far more restrictve and potentially open up new content.  Instead  all forks in the path lead to what is effectively a common point.My second criticism would be the elder phase -  the choices are mundane - one choice will pretty much cause How monsters/humans view one another to go up and the other cause it to go down.  The phase is akin to clicking ""help"" or ""sabotage"" buttons 15 times in a row.  The adventures themselves were creative but the choice selections and how they cause """"your own adventure"" to evolve in my view lacked creativity.Summary - The mini adventures are quite amusing but other aspects of the game are lacking.For 2-3$ and the replayability of seeing how each choice affects your traits it gets a borderline thumbs up."

Its mostly ambience.You'll be trying to achieve all the endings - which is about 10 or so... So you're going to basically go through the same basic process over and over again- like for about- 10 times or even more times assuming you might get one repeated ending on acicdent. So after the second trial i was basically breezing through without even reading a good portion of the time excluding the answers I'd assume would give me a specific benefit i was looking for.The games story is a bit childish- yeah. But it's pretty charming and a decent time-passer.Pretty sure if you let a kid play this they'd enjoy it unless they have dyslexia or some sh!t like that.I wouldn't get it on full price- though.

You can tackle different scenarios (which are various but do become repetitive) to get different results but in the end there is not much to this game. The art style is nice although it doesn't animate much at all and everything is pretty static. But the visual style and fonts are at least easy to look at. I can't say if this is suitable material for younger kids because it does have some rather violent imagery brought forth in some of the written scenarios but they never get too serious or morbid.I really don't see any more charm to it.Cute? yes.Mildly interesting? yes.Passable?

,Not Recommended,226740,12029862,"Posted: 8 September, 2014",all,Xibanya,"The game promises you can make ""decisions that affect the world of Monsters and Humans."" but none of your monster's decisions in life carry over once they finally reach the end of it.  This game could have been promising if, Crusader Kings style, when playing as a monster born after the previous one the impact of the previous monster could be felt, but every time you start as a new monster, it is as though you had never played the game before.  The game teases social changes in monster society, but since the game never advances forward in time, it's all just window dressing, as no matter what everything will be reset once your current monster dies.  Given that each playthrough is extremely brief, the result is a shallow experience.  Most of the endings are basically stamps for finishing a brief runthrough with a monster who had a certain combination of stats.Your choices in the game affect your monster's personality, but your monster's personality stats do not have much effect overall.  As far as I can tell, when you begin a new game you get a randomly selected monster image to act as your monster's avatar.  Unfortunately, unlike other monster raising games (like the genre-creating Tamagotchi, cutting age software from the year of our lord 1998) your monster's personality and disposition do not affect its appearance.  Your monster's personality stats affect skill checks in the ""Elder"" segment of the game, and in a few places before, but once you get to the Elder segment the game allows you to choose your best stat for use in skill checks, meaning you will pass every one that you attempt.Another complaint is that the game features a few recurring characters, but events show an image of a generic monster whose emotion is meant to represent the emotional energy of the scene.  It would have been nice for these images to show the recurring character that is involved in the scene instead.This game has a lot going for it - the art is fun and the interface is fine.  The monster society has some fun ideas behind it.  But unless the game can get more interactive, I cannot recommend it to others."

Unfortunately, this game is short, and there are choices, but the choices are fairly leading. I played through twice and the game doesn't change at all; with the only difference being if you are able to acend to the final stage or if you dissolve after adulthood. When you finish and receive an ""outcome"" the game slots the outcome into a wheel (you can see these empty spaces on the beginning screen). Perhaps something interesting happens once you've earned every outcome, but I won't spend the time it would take to figure that out. After the second playthrough I find this game to be exceptionally tedious.I recommend this game for achievement enthusiasts and people who enjoy short, mindless games (don't get me wrong, I like mindless games too when I'm feeling lethargic and want to relax).

I wish there was a way to toggle off some of the more graphic scenerios, or at least to flag certain story options that could be upsetting. I volunteer at animal shelters and I've done some work at vetrinary clinics, and the simple exposition style effectively brings to mind images of actual suffering I've seen.(Minor spoilers)There are several instances of unavoidable cat murder and abuse. I've got a bleeding heart, and I know it, but It was hard to enjoy the story knowing that just one decision ago I had broke a window with a live kitten, or that I had torn a live cat (which had been mewling and purring just a dialog ago) in half to appease two of my monster friends."

This is partially offset by the fact that there appear to be more options that will appear in a single playthrough, and that you won't be able to ever pick all of the options every time either.  The inclusion of Achievements and Cards give some added depth, but some of the Achievements appear to be based on failing in some scenarios so it's not always apparent what might need to be done for the Achievement Hunter.The soundtrack is minimalist, but the solo accoustic guitar  is pleasant and quite nice, and matches the style of the artist very well.  A glaring omission, here, is the lack of a purchaseable soundtrack (at the time of this writing).  The artwork is quite lovely, and the whimsical nature of it nicely matches the intent of the game.  It is static, with only a few things that move -- mostly the clickable hotspots so that it's apparent what will actually give a response from the game -- but it feels like a callback to old adventure or even the old solely text-based games so I don't find that a bad thing.The writing is excellent, though you'll most likely find yourself skipping some sectiions as the become more familiar.  It may be a good game to play with your developing reader, though I highly recommend you play it a few times, yourself, as some of the game can wander to the dark or violent (You ARE a monster, after all.) and your mileage may vary as to what's appropriate for your own child."

It's more of a choose-your-own-adventure kind of thing. There is no platforming, no questing, no inventory, no racing. And that's completely fine.That said, if you've ever enjoyed books that allowed you to choose your own adventure, you're bound to love this. There are a lot of options and outcomes, all done in a cartoonish and clever style. Don't be fooled by the presentation though, this is not quite what you'd call a ""kid's game"".While there is no voice acting, the options you're presented with all have distinct feeling to them, which plays great with idea of shaping your monster from a morsel to an Elder. The various personality traits - such as bravery, ferocity, kindness - increase or decrease depending on your choices. Your options for the final outcome are determined by how high or how low these traits actually are. This also gives MLY plenty fo replaybility, as there are plenty of different outcomes each granting an in-game emblem as well as an achievement. Great for trophy hunters.I definitely recommend getting this if you're looking for something mellow and relaxing to pass time with. Each ""run"" is about 30-60 minutes long, depending on what scenarios you receive and how fast you read.However,know what you're getting into. I cannot stress this enough. Do not get this if you're looking to jump on platforms, or shoot things, or race vehicles - or do anything other than read and choose reactions to the situations presented. It does just this one thing, but it does it really well."

I didn't enjoy it very much (and still don't enjoy GTA-style games in general). The second game I ever played was much better - Age of Empires 2, on the PC. Why do I bring this up? Because it's important to note that I started playing video games well beyond the era of the text-based adventures and RPG's of the 80's. Which is important to note because Monster Loves You! is essentially a text-based adventure game, albiet one that doesn't require typing and has a graphical interface.It's definitely a solid game, with a clearly defined goal that you're working towards, and it's probably the right length for a modern text-based adventure. The graphical interface is cutesy enough, and is very effective in capturing the player's interest. The game also successfully incorporates some clever RPG-like stat-building, with a series of stats that can be raised or lowered depending on the conversation options the player chooses. All these elements combine into a lighter game that will be enjoyed more by casual gamers than those that play more seriously.Which is why I can't recommend this game; most people on Steam simply won't enjoy it for long enough to get their money's worth. While I enjoyed it, that was only for 51 minutes; I have no desire to play through the game again. That's not the fault of the game, moreso the fault of the genre. Gamers have simply moved on from the days of the text-based adventure, and now prefer their RPG stats to be accomponied by a 3-dimensional world that they experience through the eyes of a character they make. If you enjoy text-based adventures or more casual games, than this is a game that you'll get multiple hours of enjoyment from. Otherwise, the stat-building and graphical depiction of the story simply won't be enough to keep you captivated beyond the first playthrough."

So right off the bat, there's something of a letdown. Visually, it also isn't too stunning. There are some nice drawings here and there, but the environments and your characters seem a bit bland. The music is also forgetable. The only thing this game has going for it is its witty dialogues. And the fact that there's 14 endings, so there's quite a bit of replay value. But not too much. I've spent 8.2 hours on this game and got all of the endings. I'm not saying I didn't enjoy playing it, because it does have a certain charm, but I can think of countless other games that cost less, yet blow this one out of the water."

I was worried that a lot of decisions might have flip-side effects that make decisions far more difficult than they seem, but they're not.I was really looking forward to fleshing out my character and choosing between eating children, becoming an outcast creature or building friendships and skills such as Alter Ego that this game, I am guessing, is heavily built from. But it's not.I played through the whole thing - including reading and considering every decision - in an hour. Yes, there's replay value to be sure, but for no other reason than to get achievements and a pat on the back for clicking the right, very terribly obvious, buttons.It's a shame that the developers didn't do more with this. There was such a great possibility here.In the last stage of the game, you're offered two icons with a %. One is how much monsters like humans, and the other how much humans like monsters. You just have to press some buttons to get these in the direction you want, for the outcome you want. If you balanced your character throughout the game - which isn't very difficult, I wound up with 90%+ in all on the first go, you've got no problems with this ""Grand Finale"".It's fun to play for the first couple of stages, and the dialogue is actually very well written, and the graphics are comically wonderful - however, this only reaches out to the child side of me.

You probably won't have one play through right after another. I've played through only twice but there's still plenty I still haven't seen. There are many different endings to discover and there are loads of text choices to make. Every single encounter has at least 2 outcomes and most have 3 or 4. The game's strong point is definitely at the beginning of each play through. This is mainly because it tends to get pretty repetitive towards the end where you just want to get to the ending itself. Which is then also pretty disappointing.This game's strong point is in it's encounters detail. If for some reason or another you don't find it repetitive and stick with it, there's a surprisingly large amount of content. Which whilst I personally aren't getting a whole lot out of, others definitely will. 67/100"

The reason is that even though you don't always get the same quests, after awhile they do start to repeat...so after the first couple of playthroughs it gets a bit, well, repetitive .Not only that but there is no save feature, meaning that to get every ending you have to play through the entire game each time.Otherwise this is a quirky and enjoyable choose your own adventure and definitely worth a look, especially if you can catch it on sale."

While there are no fancy animations or 3D graphics, your journey as a monster is presented through charming illustrations akin to a children's picture book.The spawning vat you start out in as a ""morsel"" is a very original take on reincarnation - all monsters originate from the vat, but when their time to pass on is due and they do not reach elderhood, they return to the spawning vat and dissolve, their ""essence"" (defining personality traits) being recycled into the next generation of monsters, starting the cycle anew.The actions you take allow you to accumulate points which determine your most prominent personality traits: bravery, honesty, kindness, ferocity and cleverness. You must also gain respect from other monsters in order to ascend to Elder status - the final stage of the game in which you influence the fate of human and monster relations.It may feel a little tedious at times however, as you will most certainly find yourself playing through the same adventure more than once to attain the traits you want to give your monster.That being said, if you enjoy games with multiple choices and alternate endings, I would still recommend this."

Being short and shallow is forgivable, but an added lack of replayability should put anyone off the 10 euro price tag.In any other story game, what you do locks you into a distinct route through the story. Befriended a certain character, choose to pick up a sword and take the route through the creepy forest? You can be sure that character will remember, you're more likely to become a swordfighter and you might learn something in the forest that you can use later on. Sure, there might be some statistics involved, as you'll need strength to handle your sword and maybe at least 20+ survivalism to make it through the forest, but these are the things that bind you to the story. It sets you on a certain path that creates a mood, an understanding of the world, expectation of what happens next and gets you exclusive endings unavailable somewhere else that makes you feel like it was worth investing. It makes you feel the game/story recognizes you and entertains you with how it accomadates your unique choices and personality.Monster loves You has none of that. The game has three to four chapters, one for each stage of your life. In each stage, you have the choice out of some 20 adventures, with you having the time to go on some 12. All of them are already unlocked straight from the get go and they have no bearing on what kind of monster you are or on what what choices you've made before as a story. Being the goal of the game, they each raise your stats by a bit and by the third chapter certain adventures require your stats to be at a certain level before you can succeed to gain... more stats. By the fourth chapter, you can proceed to use your stats to crudely manipulate the outcome of the game and get the different endings by... raising or lowering new stats with the correct stats.You can randomly kill one day and spare the other. You can get nearly killed by humans at the start of your life and then get a happy ending with the humans at the end, without any explanation. It just is... because of stats. Other monsters don't actively recognize your past actions. As long as you pick the right buttons to make the correct gauges go up, and regardless of who you are, you can work yourself up towards any available outcome. Sure, sticking to a specific personality gets you furthest, but only because you can't possibly level all the stats and being consistent at least raises enough of them to succeed to pass checks.It deprives the game of personality and the feeling you're interacting with a living world, when the two of you simply don't react to each other in a way that is based on story.That said, the game looks okay if you like the artstyle and I can vouch that the writing is actually kind of great, but as a game or an interactive story, it fails abysmally with shallow mechanics."

It is a highly fun game, with plenty of replay value--though I do warn you should always click on whatever new adventure you have possible to avoid repetition. It's definitely more akin to a book then a game, so don't hop in expecting a average 'point and click adventure'. Another slight warning; This game is very child-friendly from what I've played so far, but does depict death and the 'natural cycle of life'. I feel as if it covered the topic wonderfully (Especially if you choose to 'delay' near the end, and talk with the monsterling.), which may actually be a plus for parent's who aren't quite sure how to explain such complicated matters to children. An average playthrough is roughly one-hour long, but the game is definitely replayable for at least two more times (possibly not in the same day, however.)

The game consists of many small storylets which you can choose a respone to, and are then rewarded with stat points corresponding to that response. These stat points make up the “personality” of your monster, and later may determine how much other monsters respect you, and ultimately your ending.I generally like things like raising sims and CYOA games, so I was kind of surprised by how little I enjoyed this game. Overall, I see two major issues with it: it lacks meaningful choices, and it’s too long for what it is. Most of the storylets described rather mundane events (i.e. should I save my friend from bullies, or join in on beating him up), so seeing alternative resolutions to those wasn’t especially interesting. And there doesn’t appear to be any real consequence to raising a ferocious monster versus a kind monster, aside from gathering achievements.CYOA-type stat building games can be fun if they don’t overstay their welcome (for example, The YAWHG), but I found myself getting pretty bored by about the halfway point of each playthrough of this game."

It's a bit of a choose-your-own adventure game, a point-and-click title to be sure, and if that isn't your kind of game, you may not enjoy Monster Loves You!. It's short, too -- you can get through a game pretty quickly, and there's also a ton of reading to be done since the majority of the game is conveyed through text.But-- that said, this game is still absolutely delightful for what it is, and if this IS your kind of game, you're going to have an amazing time.Visually, the game is delightful and eye-catching. The art style lends itself very well to the game and the stories that unfold, in my opinion! The music and sound effects are also perfectly on-point, as well, and honestly the main menu music is really good, it's something I listen to by itself because it's so peaceful. The design work that went into Monster Loves You! has not gone unappreciated as far as I'm concerned.Mechanically, the game works by giving you different actions you can take at various stages of your Monster's life. There are MANY different choices you can make that infleunce your monster's growth, and each one has bearing on not just your stats, but on both your own life and the lives of your fellow monsters. Each time you play, it's a unique experience -- there are so many different events that can happen and choices to make that it keeps things fresh well into multiple playthroughs. Your choices really do have impact and shape how you grow up and how you can later impact the world, and the monster you grow into being will depend entirely on the choices you make. The number of things you can choose to influence the story, the different ways you can ultimately shape the world if you choose -- it's really special.For those who are interested in them, there are Achievements for completing the game in numerous different ways, and that can incentivize a person to keep playing and to see what more the game has to offer.At the end of the day, Monster Loves You! isn't a game for everyone. It's a mostly text-based adventure, it doesn't have multiplayer, and it gets repetetive over successive playthroughs.But it's also a solid game, and it will hold your attention while you play it. It is polished and charming, and even in 2017, the devs are still maintaining and improving it. It is a robust experience for what it is, and even if it's not for everyone -- for those who did take an interest, well, I can at least personally say that I had a ton of fun with this game, and I still pick it up now and again because the world the developers have crafted is nothing if not endearing. It is FUN -- and sometimes that's all a game needs to be. Monster loves you is fun, and well-made, and it's funny and quirky and, at times, poignant, too. It is a well-made experience that puts a smile on your face when you play it, and I think that's a pretty great accomplishment.And it's for those reasons that I can't recommend this game highly enough. Monster Loves You, and I love this game right back."

Once I was an elder I tried to bring humans and monsters to be friends and it worked out even when I failed the first human interaction by trying to help her marriage troubles since I forgot that humans and monsters didn't mix and I got chased out of the house when I broke into the house, lol. I got humans to 97% and monsters to 100%, so I lucked out there too.Anyway, this is a game all about choice and choosing who you will be. 'Course, even after maxing out kindness and bringing relations between humans and monsters to 100%, when the humans come you can still eat them or declare war, which is a bit hilarious but weird."

It's also pretty simple, not like Academagia or some other RPG simulations I've enjoyed, with complex skill sets and abilities. In Monster Loves You! all you do is choose one of two or three options for each scenario you un into, and each of these choices is pretty obvious in how it's going to affect your stats. You can become the type of monster you want to be easily, there's no real nuance to it. And the stats don't seem to alter gameplay a terrible amount except for the endings. Based on Steam achievements, there are 14 possible endings, so there's a decent amount of replay possibility here, but without my stats having more of an obvious impact, the emotional element that would make me want to replay the game that many times is just kind of lacking.Defintely worth the price during summer sale, though! And probaly something kids who lke this sort of thing would enjoy."
,Recommended,226740,32715525,Posted: 24 June,all,darklordbambi,"""Monster Loves You"" is a sort of choose your own adventure game where you play in a unique and creatively designed moster world.The premise is cute and fun to play through, and makes you think about what kind of moster you want to be. Though it's not too difficult to get your ideal ending if you want (Bringing peace between humans and mosters), it's still a fun experience to go through.I can't speak to it's replayability as I've only gone through once, but I feel I made a good choice in this purchase. If you're tight on money, I'd recommend buying it when it's on sale, as while it's fun, I can't guarantee it won't gather dust and be 10 dollars out of your pocket for what would be at most maybe a 5 dollar deal for you. However, I felt like it was fun enough that I might pick it up again, and I don't feel sour having spent 10 bucks on it.Overall, I'd give this game a 7/10."

The design is cute, the look of your monster changes depending on what qualities you chose to have. There is many possibilities and I find it fun to play with a friend, it is funny to see what kind of monster you can create together.So, my advice is to get it while it's cheap ! You'll enjoy it even more."

,Recommended,226740,33824874,Posted: 26 July,all,AndriasSch,"Monster Loves You! Was a very cute game to play, with many interesting stories to tell. The game gives you several options at the start about what kind of personality you want for your monster, and through every stage of his growth and life you will be able to earn experience (or points in different personality traits) depending on your decisions.The more you play the more interesting it gets and you will be able to reach several different types of endings.I think the price is worth the game and how many gameplay hours it provides. This is the kind of game that you can go back to from time to time."

76561198032632811,Recommended,226740,34767399,Posted: 5 September,all,CasualCheetah,"I had a very pleasure time playing Monster Loves You!It’s a well-polished adventure storybook game that's definitely worth a play.The game is charming, funny and adorable, tells a great story of your own partial making and displays a great visual art style.  The choices you make (initially) feel unique and personal. The soundtrack fits the game just right and provides helpful atmosphere.The only issue is that it's not really worth playing more than one time since in order to get unique endings you have to click through tons of sections you’ve already seen before. Endings are usually only a few clicks away from each other and sometimes require a few small difference in choices throughout a playthrough.I would recommend it if you can find it for a bit cheaper or if there’s someone special you’d want to share the experience with.:)"

At least to a degree.However, once the story is done, its done, there are multiple ways to accomplish the ending you want, but over all, I expect this game to be forgotten about over time. It is good for a few playthroughs though."
