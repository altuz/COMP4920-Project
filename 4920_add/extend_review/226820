This one looked particularly good to me from the trailer, and it did not disappoint. It wasn't as challenging as some others (Crystal Skull comes to mind) but it was not overly easy either. I also enjoyed the plot, and the ability to choose how it ended (to a degree) was quite interesting. Overall, I'd probably put it in my top 5 ND games."

I'm already a big fan of this game series, but this one takes the cake. The characters are great, the puzzels are interesting, the environment is spooky as heck (and takes place in my home state. Bonus points!), and the mystery is mature. I don't mean that it's too adult for a younger audience, but it deals with more complicated family issues than just ""someone stole my jewlery."" It deals with issues of love and marriage, mental illness, abandonment, family legacy, and there's no outright villain. It also walks a line of ""we don't really know if ghosts are real or not,"" and I liked that, too. It's more complex than other ND games, and I love it for that. I almost never felt stuck or frustrated, and the plot was riviting the whole way through. I'm not sure Her interractive can beat this one, but I'm always looking forward to their next game."

This game is by far the spookiest though, from the random shadows that fleet across the screen to other strange happenings. If you're faint-of-heart, you might like another one of the Nancy Drew games better, or at the very least, don't play this one at night! :-P All-in-all though, the graphics, storyline, and characters are really engaging. Herinteractive really strived to make this game one of their best yet. I have few qualms with the game itself--some of the puzzles were a little too challenging for me, but it's definitely a good brain tease at the very least! Many of the Nancy Drew games recently have really focused on visiting a variety of countries to welcome new cultures to the game. While I fully approve of this notion, some of the games come off as a wee bit stereotyped. This particular game, however, is not one of them. This game has a true sense of place because it's not just aiming to put another Herinteractive flag on the map. The location itself doesn't really pertain much to the game (though it is stated), which in my opinion, makes the gameplay so much more realistic. :-)"

But we did. Maybe that just means we're big weenies, though I'd like to think that just means HER Interactive made a solidly creepy game. I loved the atmosphere of this game, as well as the backstory. While I had hoped for more oomph in the resolution, I - we - enjoyed our time at Thornton Hall."

The paranormal aspect of the game was spooky without being corny and the action started off right away. There was a lot of interesting dialogue and plenty of independent exploring with a lot of new locations and surprises along the way. I really enjoyed Ghost of Thorton Hall and I think it was sufficiently challenging without being overbearing about it. I'll definitely be revisiting this one!

76561198256132396,Recommended,226820,19794702,"Posted: 19 December, 2015",all,Adelahn,"I absolutely loved this game. I have played quite a few of the Nancy Drew games, and this was definitely one of the best as far as storyline and the puzzles are concerned. It might have been the scariest as well, although that really depends on what makes you scared. If you are a serious gamer, you can't expect these games to have the kinds of graphics and interaction that other games have (i.e. Portal), but for what they are, they are very well done and fairly entertaining. If you are looking for a nice and relaxing challenge, play it on senior detective. Junior is pretty easy and is better done for simple storyline purposes. If there are puzzles you have a hard time with, HerInteractive has a forum board set up with hints for the puzzles and sections where it might not be clear what you should do, but I didn't have to make use of that as this game was pretty well streamlined. I recommend it as a good puzzle game."
,Recommended,226820,26625756,"Posted: 15 November, 2016",all,SausageGrillerMVP,"Okay, I'm gonna start this off by saying I'm a huge adventure/puzzle genre fan. The thing that I deeply love about these games from Nancy Drew to Myst, is that each game requires you to keep a comprehensive notebook of all the little puzzle hints and answers you find to write down. It really adds to the immersion of the game and makes it all the more satisfying to play. That out of the way, if you are looking for a casual puzzler that doesn't require you to remember what the heck you were doing when you last saved, this probably isn't your game.Thornton Hall is shorter than a lot of the Nancy Drew Games I've played. I finished it in about 8 hours, and I'm guessing it prolly takes around 10-15 hours for someone not as familiar with the games. However, it's complete with some pretty interesting puzzles, and really subtle environmental details that make the world fun to look around in and discover new clues. I'd say this is a pretty good start for getting into the game series if you've been a fan of other point and clicks. The plot is pretty ehhh (ooooh ghost in a sppooooky house, gravestones, ooooooo), but the fun and charm comes from how satisfying it feels to read up on things like making makeshift batteries and then figure out how to put one together. Oddly enough, some of the knowledge you read about in ND are actual science facts or real trivia tidbits?? There's definitely been situations I've been in where I've known an answer to something thanks to a ND game lolDon't feel weird playing a mystery game under the name ""Nancy Drew"". It's a super solid point and click mystery series that anyone can play, and this one adds another fun title into the mix."

I prefer the spookier Nance Drew games, but while this one had it's share of scares (good ones!) I thought it fell short on the mystery. The sleuthing never really feels like it gets going and the culprit is predictable. While the setting has a lot to offer you never really delve into the history of it the way you do in some other games, and the end result felt shallow and unsatisfying to me. You're more likely to have other characters rattling off information to you than doing any of the research yourself.That being said it isn't a bad game by any means. I enjoyed several of the puzzles like the sudoku thing, the coffins and the stained glass window. And the tea! It just felt a little simplistic and uninspired to me. I think it'll work well for casual or new players, but as someone who enjoys a challenge I was disappointed and probably won't be playing this one again."

The story is deep and more fitting for a slightly older audience. I grew up playing Nancy Drew games (13 years now) and always hoped they would create storylines more fitting for an older audience. The atmosphere is spooky and the puzzles are a good level of difficulty. I will say that if you've played Nancy Drew games before, the puzzles will give you deja vu. The best example I have is with a gravestone puzzle... I won't say too much though!"
