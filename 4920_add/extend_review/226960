76561198007384293,Not Recommended,226960,8003663,"Posted: 11 December, 2013",all,CaptainCoxwaggle,"A rather disappointing game considering the system itself had potential, but is unfortunately woefully incomplete (apparently more content is coming out as DLC, but the base content as it is is barebones).Initially the game possessed a intriguing system of unlocking new units through the completion of mini-achievements, allowing your cards to evolve into a more effective and specialised fighting force. Unfortunately this feature is only seen in the first half dozen cards before never being seen again.The game also featured several factions with different tactics and units that you can mix and match. Unfortunately again, all the factions with the exception of the army (Union and Confederate's are both considered the same, begging the question as to why it is set in the Civil War) have barely enough cards for a playable deck, much less one that you can base a unique strategy out of. This is further made worse by every faction's units being essentially the same thing (Army riflemen and bandits have absolutely no distinguising characteristics between them).Even worse, the potential dynamic was there, in the form of unattainable weapons and units the computer gets during the campaign. After completing the game, and every last achievement (both single player and multiplayer) I was upset that the only things I receieved were more of the same cards. Indeed, the final boss's deck is displayed as an available playable faction, but does not have a single unit or weapon card in it.The story serves it's purpose I suppose, so it is hardly disappointing, but it is somewhat baffling that early in the story you can clearly see a sibling rivalry, only for one of the brothers to disapear, and only come back at the end of the game to do absolutely nothing, unlike the collection of minor characters who assemble for the purpose of serving as an Deus Ex Machina during a mission. Whoever is actually manning and directing your ironclads is never mentioned (unless it is assumed that the sergeant who gets a brief mention early in the game is the PC). The Civil war is barely mentioned, and the game might as well be set during the Anglo-Russian war for all it matters.The campaign itself is not so much challenging as it is putting you in a situation with an outright disadvantage. In the early stages this disadvantage is negated by unlocking a new weapon. However, due to the fact that there are no decent unlocks in the later missions the game simply becomes a matter of chance. Hoping that the luck of the draw gets you exactly the unit you need, and that the computer does not use the obnoxiously overpowered ability that he is granted this mission on the turn it would hurt the most. The last mission in particular is guilty in that the enemy boss is not only invincible (unless you kill two heavily armoured units guarding an electric outlet, and procede to occupy both outlets with infantry that can be killed instantly by said boss) but possessing a repetoire of weapons far superior to what you can get, and heals completely should you fail to stop him from going to your side. The strategy towards defeating him involves praying to your chosen deity that the enemy AI will decide to lay waste to your ironclads, rather then stepping on your infantry, and will stand still for that brief moment where you miraculously achieve enough firepower to destroy him in one turn. God help you if you decide to go for the achievements.All that said, the game has potential. If it simply had more content and diverse factions that would allow for actual tactical options."

Random play is equally effective as well-thought strategy and winning or losing feels like a flip of the coin.  However if you lose a round the computer will replay the round virtually identically so it becomes trivial to win next time.There's a really good game waiting to be made here, but this isn't it."

While this has some great deck building elements and interesting play mechanic, it seems to just boil down to spamming cards. And sometimes the only way to learn a level is play it and lose 20 times with different deck builds each time before finally one clicks. Now this same process can be said for many games like Super Meat Boy or others of the same ilk, but while those are quick to reset and get you back into the meat of it, this game takes time and turn order. It builds up and leaves you very twitchy and♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥when the next deck combo doesn't work. Interesting premise and great presenation, but just hampered down by mechanics that seem to wear down before their final destination."

I lost countless times on the second map, which is part of the NG tutorial. You have a set deck of cards, and it was still almost impossible to beat and required amazing luck.And that's what makes this game so bad. This game lacks strategy. There is a little bit in deck building, but even if you have the best deck for a mission, there's a big chance you'll lose because of the luck of the draw. The last two boss fights had me cursing at the screen because the game puts all odds against you.Losing isn't fun, and this game does its best to make sure that you're going to lose. This game isn't worth it for free because it will just stress you out trying to enjoy it."

The AI isn't particularly intelligent. The computer will frequently, for example, equip a weapon to an ironclad that is 3 empty spaces away from making it to your side, which is a waste of AP.  If you pop an ironclad with a melee weapon right in front of an AI ironclad two spaces from your side equipped with a 2+ range weapon, they wont swap that weapon out to kill your ironclad and make it to your side-- it'll just sit there and die. To make up for the lackluster AI, however, the player is handicapped in a number of ways, making the game feel exceedingly frustrating at times.The player receives a base 1.0AP per turn, while the computer gets 1.5AP.  Then add on the fact that many of the AP-boosting objectives tend to be on the enemy's side, and the enemy often has units on the field to claim or defend them before turn 1.This provides the illusion that the enemy's deck is an endless bag of cards where they can just pull out any card they desire at any point. The computer rarely needs to play defensively because they can just spam units to put YOU on defense.  Maybe 10% of the time am I able to sneak a raider by the AI when there is an ironclad in play that they can maneuver into his path.  Manage to an armored ironclad out to scrap with one weilding a 1 damage weapon? you've got about a 75% chance that they have some way to boost the damage to ignore the armor(depending on enemy factions).  You can see how many cards the enemy has in hand, so I don't think the computer actively cheats in this regard-- it's just because of the massive AP boost that the AI gets-- cards don't need to go to waste.TL;DR- Playing checkers with a skilled player is fun, even if they beat you.  Playing checkers with an incompetent player whos friends pop in to give them extra game pieces whenever they lose some is frustrating."

The biggest reason it doesn't all come together is that given the scrolling card mechanic, even the best decks show huge variability in effectiveness depending on draw order.You can play one round and get nothing but ""upgrades"" while your opponent rolls out unit after unit, then start over with the same deck and steamroll her right off the map. I know, you're thinking ""L2P n3wb, u hav to balance ur deck."" But that's really not it. A deck that's statistically well balanced can still hit awful runs, and because each player's hand is constantly pruned to the last 5 cards dealt, there's no recovering from them.As it stands, the strategy aspect of the game feels pretty much absent - less like poker, more like war (you know, the card game ""war."")

Unfortunately, the AI sucks, and instead of making a more difficult AI on the harder levels, it just cheats.That's right, instead of bothering to make the game challenge you, the devs just give the AI more action points than you get, no deck limit (you have one), and the ability to play cards and abilities outside of the normal phases. That's incredibly lazy design, and it killed the budding affection I had for the game.If you're a tactics fan and can get it cheap on a sale weekend, I'd say buy it - it's worth $3 for multiplayer.

However, it sucks you in quickly and, it must be said, sneakily. The tutorials flow seamlessly into the main campaign, from missions where you have just a handful of cards and playing them is so simple you don't even grasp what the challenge could possibly be, and yet soon every missions presents a new and fresh challenge. This may be the best learning curve I have ever encountered, and the tutorialising is very gentle. You encounter more and more challenging units to defeat, and the game encourages out-of-the-box thinking. Beating the game is a healthy challenge, and 100% completion is Herculean, which is how it should be.The story, meanwhile, is absolute nonsense but very enjoyable. That is to say, it's steampunk."

,Recommended,226960,12188327,"Posted: 22 September, 2014",all,rgk,"Ironclad tactics is a fast paced turn-based tactics game based on card deck building. Since this description doesn't help, here is a slightly better one: the player chooses various soldiers and weapons from a consequent number of available ones. A card deck comprises 20 of these picks. Each deck has to be chosen carefully according to the needs of each mission. The battles consist of playing the cards (appearing in a random order) to send troops and give them equipment. They move automatically forward on the lanes they are deployed on, but the tactical possibilities are numerous with the ability to stop a unit, sometimes switch lanes, use weapons that target specific lanes, add a specific customization to a mecha and so on. The game seems like real time to the player, but the actions are conducted by the computer in quick, seamless turns.This might seem complicated on paper, but in-game it works very intuitively so that the player can fully focus on choices and tactical decisions. And the fast speed allows for the battles not to drag on, they even trigger a lot of adrenaline as the player has to think fast and is always kept on the edge. The gameplay is really good and works well in these half fast-paced half-slowed down conditions.However, where this game also really shines is in the level design. Usually strategy games can be repetitive as the players figure out their favorite strategy and repeat it to go through every mission. In Ironcland Tactics, each mission is different with the levels having a specific gimmick and the enemy deploying specific troops. While at first it can seem overwhelming if using the deck that was tailored for the previous level, this actually relates more to a puzzle game where the player has to figure out a well suited tactic to win. Card decks thus have to be customized specifically for every mission. So even if some might consider this very challenging when they don't know yet which strategy to use, I find it brilliant. It completely prevents the game from feeling repetitive with a single formula repeated ad nauseam, and keeps me thinking on how to tackle each new battle and makes me feel great for figuring out new strategies. Although, even if I mentioned a puzzle game inspiration, this game is not as static and mind taxing as a puzzle game, it remains very dynamic.The story missions are linked through nicely made comics, reinforcing the feeling that overall this game has been carefully crafted. Additionally, the story can be played in online Coop as the players fight together and have to coordinate their strategy (forget it if you are not on voice communication, good communication seems pretty much required to succeed without making stupid mistakes - well these mistakes still happen on voice communication and can be hilarious, such as when one player decides to give a speed boost to a unit from the second player who decided that it should strategically hold position). And if you want to get revenge on your teammate for a mistake, there is always the possibility for 1 vs 1 to settle things non peacefully. Also of note, some missions can add a nice twist to the 1 vs 1 multiplayer such as the possibility for one of the two players to use a boss deck.This game bears the ""Tactics"" subtitle perfectly well. I am very glad I discovered it in my Steam Library during its free week-end and gave it a curious try, otherwise I would never have known that this game is so good and keeps me so entertained while keeping my brain active."

After a point the game starts to become incredibly RNG-based and spoon-feeds you specific cards to make decks. The game features a deck crafting system,as you may have gathered,but you can only use a maximum of 2 of the 6 factions in crafting. This makes some decks hard to create as the game doesn't like to give enough space to build some interesting decks.The campaign is rather short as well,although the story is interesting and using a comic style to relay the story was a nice feature. Personally I got incredibly frustrated with the later levels as the enemy seemed to be getting just the right card when I kept getting useless ones. The game also has co-op for the campaign and a multiplayer.TL;DR: Ironclad tactics has a nice art style,an interesting story,meh deckbuilding,and a cool concept however,the game is based incredibly on RNG and the AI is quite good at countering your cards.Buy it on sale if it drops to like ten dollars."

This gives you plenty of time to use strategy and tactics.The campaign is beautifully illustrated and offers all sorts of diverse missions, and even includes boss fights. Along the way, it yields a steady stream of card unlocks that offer lots of card diversity. Just don't expect historical accuracy because this is Steampunk in a Civil War setting, and not a Civil War game with a bit of Steampunk added.The entire thing can be played cooperatively.

,Recommended,226960,29838458,Posted: 10 February,all,DT76,"I was kind of dubious about this one.  Real-time card-based tactical battles sound like they could be fun, or a disaster.  In reality, it's kind of in between.  You only have a window of a couple seconds to play stuff, and if you're trying to do multiple things, it's easy to click in the wrong spot and screw up your whole plan.  It also sounded like it was based on the old Bureau of Steam Engineering browser game, which I played only a minute of and found incomprehensible.  Luckily, there's no connection except theme.The game also has the problem that you're drawing at random from a 20-card deck, so even with a lot of redundancy, you can get starting hands and continued draws that are exactly not what you need.  If one side gets a good draw and is running right out of the gate, while the other has to wait around for a few turns to get anywhere, the game could be effectively over already.  That's because board presence is vital, and there aren't that many ways to catch up once you're behind.The other thing about the game is that it lives or dies based on card variety and interactions (like most card games).  The cards are divided into factions, and you can only have 2 different factions in your deck at a time.  Some of these factions feel more fleshed out than others.  You unlock cards by completing missions in the single-player campaign, but even 100%ing the 2nd playthrough doesn't get everything.  One faction's cards wait on the first expansion campaign, which is good, but has to be purchased.  Once you've done the campaign, there's not much else to do but try multiplayer.  Each match you win here gets you a card unlock from a new, distinct faction.  The trouble is, there hardly ever seems to be anyone on.  So, it's a catch-22.  You want to get more cards, but can't get them until you win, but have only MP battles to use them on once you do, but can't even get those battles in the first place.Still, I enjoyed it quite a bit.  These potential difficulties mostly fade away when you get into the game.  The interface, the look and sounds of the units all feel right.

(E.g., deck-building + tactical positioning + well-balanced factions). Also, the decision to go with a twenty-card-deck meant that, while the significance of each card choice was considerable, it was also far easier to gauge the effectiveness of specific strategies. As a result, this might actually be a good choice for introducing someone to the genre.In all, I had a lot of fun with this title and will likely return to it at some point in order to check out the expansion campaign.[Note: I have not played any of the multiplayer modes, though I'd like to try the Co-Op at some point.]"

Most of the challenge comes from building specialized decks to solve the puzzle that each level presents. Your AI opponent will have the upper hand with some new attack or defense and you’ll have to come up with a counter. Most of the time this results in a tense battle of planning, wits, and fortune. When you tweak a deck combo into working just right it feels great! Each new card opens up lots of tactical options and completing challenges for cards feels rewarding.The civil war theme and story are awesome. I love the characters and animated comics that set up you journey across America. The in-game art and animation is beautiful. It’s easy to tell every unit apart and their abilities match the visuals. A robot with a jetpack files, dude with a shotgun has spread attack, and a flame thrower hits multiple targets. .Each level starts by showing you 5 random cards from your deck of 20, so sometimes it feels like a lucky/unlucky start can make or break a win. If cards come out in just the wrong order it can kill a plan, but managing this problem is also part of the art of deck building. It improved a bit with the release of the first DLC where you can now spend 1 action point to ‘save’ a critical card for later.The first DLC uses an army with a completely different and fun style of play. It’s satisfying playing as the boss enemies that were beating you down in the final levels and to understanding the logic behind how their robots transform. It also fills in missing parts of the story with more comics.Not every ability or tactic is perfectly balanced, but there’s lots of viable strategies to solve each problem. That said, I haven’t played multiplayer which would be a much better gauge of balance. There’s not enough players to support random matchmaking and I don’t feel like it would be that fun against friends (even if they unlocked all the cards). I also haven’t tried the co-op mode, which is supported throughout the entire game but I think it would be pretty fun!UPDATE:I have bough both of the dlcs before june 20th and really want a refund while keeping the dlcs but I won't be fussy with them because well that's a bit mean.

This is done by activating cards at varying cost that you collect as you play the game. Some units are better suited against others and you can get some cards to move units, heal and damage. On paper this sounds quite fun. However, I am not a big fan of these lane games as I find them quite boring. True the cards add a new element but just throwing units at the enemy hoping hey get through whilst they do the same doesn't keep my interest. Also I don't know if I am just crap at this game but I tend to lose quite a few games on a level before I get the win and this seems mainly down to luck. The idea of the American civil war with steam powered Mechs is a cool concept though. Basically if you like lane fighting games, you will like this.

Although it's probably entirely possible to work your way through the game without ever going back to complete the story challenge objectives, you might find it difficult without those extra cards. (Whereas in Spacechem you only have what you're given in each level. You aren't collecting tools along the way.)2) Beat the clock - although the game is turn-based, you have to keep track of a number of game elements and make your plays in a fairly brief window of time. (Whereas in Spacechem only the boss fights have a time element and that only has to do with execution, not designing your reactors.)3) Luck of the draw - It's annoying to have a well planned deck fail multiple times, then finally succeed when you get the cards in a reasonable order. I don't mind losing to AI, but losing to the random number generator is irritating. (Whereas in Spacechem the only apparent randomness is in some of the reactor inputs, but the point is your design needs to detect and handle each case appropriately.)If the above game design elements don't bother you, then you should give Ironclad a look. It's certainly a more polished work than Spacechem, but unfortunately it doesn't require anything like the intense problem solving that Spacechem does. (But for some people that might be a plus.) I don't regret my purchase since the money went to Zachtronics, but I didn't get nearly as much value out of this game as I did from Spacechem. (Go buy Spacechem.)"

Starting from halfway around the game, you play against very strictly formed decks and all you have to do is play against the deck, learn its advantages & disadvantages by being defeated, form a deck specific for the current opponent, and beat him.

The game is a card game in which you need to win a certain amount of victory points by having key units exit the map on the enemies side.. of course the enemy tries to do the same with his  key unit exiting of your side of the map. Next to the units which you summon with the appropiate cards, you have cards that enhance them or allow them to do special moves. Some cards are tied in with a special units.You can design your own deck with the cards so that you can play the game the way you want, although sometimes you are forced to play with a certain deck.. especially when you want to win bonus cards or solve puzzles.I followed the story mode until I got stuck and discovered that next to the story mode there are other options to win additional cards and units. The end battle I found particular hard to win.The game is a kind of a mixed bag. On the one hand it is fun game with a nice visual style and mood. The art design is cartoony which is well chosen as it fits well the mood of the game.  The story mode is told via cartoons, which I found captivating at first, but near to the end I started to click through to get to the battle. The makers made a wise choice not to force players to sit through a story every time they are defeated  and have to replay it again and I think I even gained cards when I was defeated.The  other hand, the down side, is that the game remains a random card game and it isn't easy to build a tactic around it.  In addition you get often thrown into a unknown situation with no clue about what you are up against, so that you might find yourself losing because you simple have the wrong cards and units to defeat the challenge. Especially the end battle is heavily dependent on luck.. if you luck out you lose, if you luck holds you win.In addition I don't quite understand why the makers chose to split the cards up in groups of which you can only have two at the same time. At least one group has no units and another consists mostly of units that are into sneaking and have no use in a regular fight. Why this limitation has been introduced remains a mystery as you are limited to 20 cards and I can't think of a combination of cards that would make someone invincible.. but maybe you can..Anyway.. would I recommend it..Well, yes.. for a short while."

Fits the theme, and makes me think very much of Penny Arcade in the drawing style, which is a positve.Then, oh my, the game itself. It's a little... weird. I've never really played these kind of things online, but having been a huge M:TG fan way way back when, it's definately got a good spin on the idea. I dislike the idea of having such a limited pool of cards to play with. I can totally understand limiting the selection of cards so you have to have at least 20, but so far (and I don't know if this changes during the game later on) you're stuck with just twenty, and that's not a positive. We've all these wonderful combinations that we just can't do due to limited deck size. That's one major downside to the deck building aspect, but such is life - and it's not terrible, just would have preferred more wiggle room in that department.In terms of strategy, seems quite simple, until you try and achieve some of the challenges - which make luck/rush a bit more of a factor, but they're fun to go for. Although there are times I wish I could freeze my cards from cycling, again, because of rng. But I do enjoy the timed aspects of the turn based system, making it simulataneous makes a huge difference to how it feels, and makes it much more actiony.I can definately see me letting my boy play this, as he loves Pokemon et all, and this seems a little more grown-up in terms of game, but he's starting to get into them.Cons:- It's random past your deckbuilding. If you're not a player of those type of games, this might frustrate you.- Some of the starts you get, where you're outmatched immediately are frustrating, especially with random luck.- It's a little simplistic. Doesn't have some of the same depth you may be used to if you're familiar to the format.- While I've not played the game to death yet, although I can see myself enjoying this later on, I suspect it will feel very samey aftera while.Pros:- It's cheap and while there's DLC, it doesn't have the spend spend spend attitude of many of the trading card style of games.- If you enjoy tcg's, then you'll find the game quite intuitive, apart from the turns flying by if you're a ""muller over of things"".- Graphics are nice, and the story so far seems interesting and for what few words there are, well written.- Easy to get into, just from a short play time, I can see myself getting into this a lot more.Simple, cheap and quite a lot of fun.

All cards are unlocked through playing.Very satisfying visuals and a good soundtrack.The only disappointing aspect has been lack of online players in my timezone (Singapore), I keep trying though."

A mix betwen real-time and turn-based strategy with randomized cards (you can make decks) representing the actions you can take.  Very engaging and fun; lots of challenges so plenty of replay value.  Pretty easy to learn but difficult to master.  Two bonethumbs up

You must counter enemy units with your own and push on the advance to get your units to the other side to destroy your enemy.  There is a bit of a weird difficulty curve as it does start easy and then starts randomly changing instantly from hard to easy then hard again so expect that throughout the story.Overall if you like lane pushers with cards then you will enjoy this.
