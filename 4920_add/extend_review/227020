I played most of the economics titles with the exception of tropico which i will try someday. As for Port royale and Patrician , RoV follow the logic of the economy of Kalypso titles with enough difference to have its own title, you don't place building or expand your city size like Patrician or Port Royale. Everything takes place in the wolrd map , which is not a bad things as it saves tons of loading screens. RoV requires you not to play in '' God mode '' meaning if you scale back too much the map you will miss everything froms teachers to black market or chests floating around. With the DLC the map get a decent size, still much smaller than Port Royale but bigger than a Patrican map. In short if the others titles i mentioned pleased you in the past, RoV is for you. HOWEVER, and i must warn you all, there is a massive crash bug regarding Nvidia cards which as of July 25 2014 is not yet solver at all. Yes friends almost a year out and there is still a major crash bug unresolved with no news as of we are working on it.... If you are the kind of people getting angry at stupids bugs AVOID this game at all cost. The only thing that keep me going is my addiction to the capitalism system Kalypso titles gives us. Because of this i will not recommend this game to anyone. A TDR bug with one of the most popular 3d cards of the decade means a broken game that should not have been released."

As PR3 was a failed game, kalipso labs decided to make exactly the same game but in a different geography. Detailed cities have disappeared, leaving us a full detailed map where options are really simple. Families and political issues have been improved slightly but economy is now stupid. The same price is shared by many articles so a kg of fruit costs the same as a kg of oil.No complexity appears now in this game where changing the Caribbean to the Mediterranean seem to be the most impressive game. Even comodities icons are the same.No changes, no innovation, less complexity, less detailed cities, useless combat controls, and higher prices (God save steam sales) is whats i would highlight from these cheap copy of port royal."

I bought it ages ago but never got around to it because Patrician IV is just too good. (I also secretly really enjoy these trading games). So why, in this ECONOMIC simulator, would you put a naval battle that you can't automatically resolve? You can't continue the campaign unless you win it and I am passionate, yet♥♥♥♥♥♥ at video games. I cannot capture the pirate dude for the life of me. I can't access the rest of the game because I am too♥♥♥♥♥♥at conflict to catch a bloke in a pirate costume. I just wanted to deliver citrus fruits to the smiling girls of Athens and abuse Constantinople's endless craving for pottery. Why did it have to come to this?No seriously. Why have you put an un-automatically resolvable combat mission in an ECONOMIC SIMULATOR. I came to these games because they accepted how bad I am at combat.

Which some might find off-putting, and which I sure as heck wouldn't recommend at full price.  But I got it on a Steam sale for $6 USD, and it was a steal at that price.  It's a maritime trading game with city-building elements and a nice politics/intrigue game mechanic that fits the setting along with a nice sense of progression that's a welcome add to the series.If you're not already a fan of this genre, it's not going to change your mind, but I've been playing these games for ages and I like it.

It enables you to build up a grand empire from zero up, advance to political honors and get filthy rich.Graphics: Nicely done, do their job. Nice zoom-in/zoom-out function. 8/10Sound: Not groundbreaking, but OK. 7/10Mechanics & Gameplay: One of the strong sides of the game. Nice trading system, OK combat mechanics with some tactical depth. Interface works very well after a brief learning curve. 9/10Long-term motivation: Here is the point that I found weak. After some hours the game got repetitive. I felt as if I had achieved enough money to get more or less what I wanted. Only I couldn't motivate myself to do it anymore, as it now felt pointless. In contrast to other ""endless"" building or build/fight/think games, such as the Guild, SimCity 4, X3:AP, I didn't have any goals that I badly wanted to achieve then... 4/10So, do I recommend this game? Yes, I still do! It's a well balanced, atmospheric sandbox. I would not recommend buying it at the current standard retail price, though. Wait for a sale and then grab it up for 15-30 hours of playing (or maybe more, who knows).Buy this, if you like- Port Royal- Patrician- The Guild- Pirates!and maybe- A.D. 1602/1503/1701...- X3"
,Not Recommended,227020,8410179,"Posted: 29 December, 2013",all,Chet,"Buy low.  Sell high.  But that's all.  Static map.  Static production locations.  Static prices (dynamically computed, but the cricumstances basically never change).  One or two kinds of random events that increase sale prices for a moment.The most interesting part is when you can program your own trade routes, and there is a lot of configurability in how to you load/off-load to your warehouses and how you buy amd sell, but for reasons that defy the imagination, this is done via an interface that doesn't let you see a) all of your instructions for a city at once (how much was I buying here again?), b) what the other cities on the route produce or demand at the same time, or c) what the going rates are for such goods or how much of each goods are in stock at the time.  Basically, I think a real Venetian trader in 1455 with a few parchement sheets and some chalk and tablets would have had an easier time controlling his fleet.The game is thus reduced to programming your obvious trade routes ""through a straw"" and hoping for a mission as exciting as ""Rome needs dyes"".  Oh, and there are naval battles but you'll want to automate them anyway.  Except the campaign insists that you play some of them.  So there's that."

Not bad for such a simple game, and for the right audience could be fun and worth picking up. If you aren't a patient person or don't like simulation games this isn't for you.

As both games share the same main gameplay principle, playing both simultanously didn't work for me. I recently started thinking about going back to Port Royale 3, but then I remembered I haven't given Rise Of Venice its rightful chance yet, so I started playing this instead. As evident by my play-time counter (almost 30 hours, as of writing this review), I got hooked very quickly, just like with Port Royale 3.Simply put, Rise Of Venice is a trading simulator with some strategy and political elements. The idea is to build your business empire by building businesses in cities, and trading the goods between them by your naval fleet. Just like in the real world, there are politics involved, as your competitors have their own agendas and interests, which hardly ever align with yours.Just like with Port Royale 3, there's a story-driven campaign, which I believe is the best way to start the game. Except in Rise Of Venice, the campaign feels much more than a mere tutorial. I've actually found myself enjoying the plot and the missions presented to me, and was disappointed to finish it. I really wanted it to go on. :)After the campaign, the game turns into a ""Free Play"", where you continue to build and maintain your empire. You still get missions, but there's no deep or interesting story behind them, as there was in the campaign.All in all, I really love this game, and I strongly recommend it to anyone who likes this type of games."

Unlike in P4, you don't get to plan a city, expand walls or help build a new settlement. The map is WYSIWYG.Naval battles are OK, have a nice touch with the oil and the barrels.In short: If you like P4 and want a bit less features and less depth, this game is for you.

Politics is too simplistic and could use some work but to be honest I doubt this game will be getting a DLC or get remastered in the near future.Conclusion: It WAS a great game back in its time but there are way too many adequately priced trading games these days for RoV to be worth your money."

I've seen graphics problems, but I've been in the game since Nintendo so I guess I'm not as spoiled.  It'd be nice if they fixed it, but it's easy enough to play through it.

Rise of Venice is almost an identical clone to Partician and Port Royale.  The major difference comes down to the maps.  Rise of Venice original covers the area of the world Genoa and east while the Gold version extends to the Portuguese coast of the Mediterannian.The game is broken down into ships (convoys), businesses (production buildings), and warehouses (where you manage resources).  The game can overly overwhelm new players to the sub-genre but it comes with an excellent single player that breaks down the game.  The single player campaign can take up to 20 hours to complete while the free play will be worth another 100 hours.  Add in the Challenge Mode and you are looking at a grand total of 160 hours of gameplay in this game.Unlike previous titles the game has improved ship combat.  However, all ship combat is mouse based.For what you're paying the game is well worth your time.  It's not going to be your most favorite game in your library, but it will be one you will find yourself unable to simply quit."

Port Royal 3 was just a cheap knockoff of Port Royal 2. This game is a copy of Port Royal 3 with new textures. There is NO REAL TUTORIAL aside from a few hints here and there. Towns are spaced too far apart compared to ships so that viewing the game is a sickening expiriance. Icons are horribly small compared to the map. I as of yet, have not found a way to adjust the sensitivity, and scrooling is a quest of its own. Town zones are too large for no reason, and the trading system is shotty. The most I can say for it is they have introduced a political system-- For players who want even more politics crowding thier minds. The creators have tried way to hard to pound out yet anouther game. The guality and gaming expiriance reflect the obvious lack of effort.

The series of missions that are meant to teach the game are very hard to follow and the game anyway seems to just consist of going from port to port buying and selling and doing very little else.  This reminds me of the very early computer game (before graphincs existed) called Tai Pan except that it's not as good as Tai Pan was.

As a trade and economic simulator it is entertaining but when you try to choke out your competition by using war and espionage this game is severely lacking. Naval combat in particular is unsatisfying especially when you are trying to blockade a port to strangle trade. The biggest convoy size you are able to put together is 3 ships while the coms are not limited to this and frequently come at you with convoys of 5 ships. Granted this is to combat AI being unable to make strategies like a human player but when you are fighting over a reef which negates your ability to manouver while the AI is not hampered by the reefs. Espionage is also unsatisfying and is never a good idea to use in this game as it is only good for kicking the hornets nest inviting your enemies to all start sabotaging you back negating any possible benefit in terms of reputation gain.

Plus, I get that a large ship banks different than a sloop for instance, but in PR3, and this it banks worse then your momma getting to an all you can eat buffet. I mean Pirates Gold an old genisus game the physics were better. I still like this type of game, and liked PR3, thus far better the Rise of Venice, but get PR3, since cheaper, and wait for a steam sale for this one, or even better paitence young padwan, and wait for both."

It has to be either warehouse activity only or city activity only. There is a 'captain' option which allows this, but is an AI automanage system resulting in the AI selling down to the price of production... meaning no profits) - only option then is to micromanage...*The new ""Rival"" system, although holding promise is not well executed. The AI receives huge upgrade bonuses and are not a challenge economically wise*The senate system (pleasing each family) is a burden and the sabotage system isnt fun, rather they are frustrating (Senate members are fine with sabotaging and stealing each others goods and cities, but when the player goes privateering, everyone hates you!)Port Royale was much better and had a MUCH bigger map.The campaign can be finished in around 8-10 hoursWith just a few hours the game can be ""completed"" (Supplying every city with all the goods they need)"
