I hope the developers see this. I want this game to be better. Don't pay full price, wait until its on special!!Pro's/Interesting features/positives:- Unified strategic-tactical zoom. I like using the mouse wheel to get a bigger picture.- Capturing enemy troops and making them slaves, and getting them to work/produce resources.- Storyboard and voice acting of Caeser- History lessons, fun facts in the tool tip pop ups.- Supply system and logistics. Its interesting to have to factor in the constant need for food. If only this was done better.- Supply: Getting resources around the map, rather than a phantom stockpile like in AOE2.- Supply lines, and interrupting them.- Morale of troops and enemies, routing. Idea done very well in Rome2: Total War, but half done here.- Taking hostages and sending them to other towns to guarantee public order.- Building camps at strategic points is good idea, but these are poorly done.- Seiging concepts are good - starve them out, drop their morale to zero and they surrender, or reduce the fortifications and overwhelm. I understandthe concepts but these are not clearly presented.Cons/Negatives/Feedback to Devs:-No multiplayer!- Confusion with the colour scheme. Zoomed in the Romans have green unit icons, but zoomed out, they are red figurines, and vice versa for the enemy/other factions. The faction colours are too similar.- There needs to be unique sounds to indicate an action happened. Unless you are closely watching everything in real time, the various drum beats mean nothing and blend in with the sound track.- There is no clear delineation between who is friend or foe until they start attacking you. There should be some colour system to indicate what your current diplomatic status is.- There is no clear indication of garrison or garrison strength. There is stacking under figurines on strategic map but these are not clear. Something better is needed, such as a flag.- ""Camp"" look fortified when built but are too easy to capture. There needs to be some visual cue that the camp is unguarded.- Supply lines are not clearly articulated. I want to hover mouse over line and see what the flow is, and what the rate of change is. I want to know the network, of where supplies are going, and how long to get there.- Diplomacy to way too simplistic. How is it can chose what treaty to have... can't the other side have a say?-How do I know the stats of an enemy asset? Wouldnt this be a mystery?- Faction flags are poorly done. These should clearly different from each other. Suggest and Icon.The use of figurines in general is poorly done. Its like trying recreate a board game, The figurines lack detail, need more colour differentiation and better indication of what their strength is.- Zoomed in Icons are too similar/ not easy enough to distinguish between unit types. More details needed on icons.- Resource problems... all the time... starving troops... swarming enemy... undefended settlements... no guidance from the tutorial, or manual. Its poorly presented.- No visual cues on stockpiles of resources at a settlement.- The icons indicating no food, poor morale, not in supply line, whatever the lightening symbol is etcare not clearly explained. Need a sound cue on whats going on. If voice acting is used some variety in expressions would be needed to avoid repitition (We're hungry!"" We haven't been paid!"" I cant get my goods to market!"" etc)- Needs clearer indication of when towns are requisitioned (rented!), who they are native to and that they are now under Roman control... otherwise it all looks Roman.- Requisitioning resources from allies means all workers in it disapear. Why can't I rent the resource and hire the workers too?The panels are too big and say too little.The figurines are too big and lack detail. Cities look the same zoomed out, but quite different zoomed in. Why do Gallic villages look like the Greek Acropolis??Combat system leaves a lot to be desired. Maybe I've been spoilt with RTW2... but seeing figures throwing javeline the wrong way in a seige is silly. No use of shield against missles.- Seeing slingers shoot through mountains to troops on a road on other side.- Castles look medieval... Gauls did not build such massive fortresses.- The range of units indication reticle is outrageously huge. A low key indication is needed.- Selecting units is too tricky. Suggest following conventions in other RTS.- Not enough detail in zoomed in unit icons. An inidcator bar on the left for something and on the right for something else would really help. This infor is on the unit detail panel but could better presented.- NSome features that could really improve gameplay: a technology system, unique resources,trade between factions, alliances where allies help, senate politics, disease/plague, civilians.Summary:If you get this, your patience will be tried, the learning curve steep, and the lack of expected niceties/features very fustrating. So much potential but it fell short by too far.This ambitious game has features that remind me of a number of games:- Morale like Total War,- Food like Caeser 3,- Zoom out like Supreme Commander,- Empire building like Civilisation,- Resource and supply like Knights and Merchants (and Settlers),- Building forts in strategic locations like AOE2,- Capturing forts/cities by attrition like 7 Kingdoms- Seasons and day/night like Empire Earth,- City capture like Rise of Nations,- Fog of war and figurines like Shogun Total War......but all of them did each of these concepts much much better, including games from 2001 (13 years ago) Its an ambitious game but it needs the budget and technical wizardry of the big gaming developer publishers. It especially needs sounds and visual cues, and to improve icon differentiation.Overall, 6/10. I'm glad I only bought this on a 75% off special. In its unrefined state, its not ready for full price. However if some changes were made, along with my feedback, this could be an excellent game. Don't pay full price. If you get it, prepare to be disapointed, but maybe you'll see the good side too. Its no-where near as good as the premium product of Rome 2 Total War, and is quite a different style of game, but it has some different features to keep you coming back.I hope the developers see this. I want this game to be better!"

Battles are part of the fun but it is not the main objective. Keeping your supply line, linking up your cities, and making sure you don't run out of gold is what makes the game challenging. The map is interactive and exploring in this game is fun to do. I highly recomended it for a historical and stratagy game alternative."

The towns and cities throughout Gaul come with a small snippet of history about them.- Complex supply and recruitment system.  As you conquer more territories and resources, you must work them into your supply network in an efficient manner.- Sometimes challenging AI.The Bad --- Optimization is poor to non-existent.  Even if you have a higher end machine that can run far more demanding games, odds are you will suffer from extreme lag.- Very buggy and prone to crash.-  Small selection of recruitable units.-  Awkward and clunky unit command system.- No further fixes in sight.  The developers have stated that they have moved on to other projects, so if you are waiting for patches and fixes, you may have to move on as well."

Most other reviewers seem to be firmly entrenched as die-hard supporters, or enraged that this isn't ""Rome: Total War 3.""Pros:-Surprising historical accuracy. I alt-tabbed to check wikipedia a few times and was always pleasantly surprised. Hegemony: Rome does a great job of putting you in Caesar's sandals.-Fantastic, seamless zoom-out world map. The world map is intuitive and looks exceptionally well. A tastefully done ""seamless zoom"" has been promised by strategy games for years and this one actually delivers.Cons:-General clumsiness in controlling units and the camera. Units also seem to alternate between odd rigidity and ending up locked in combat while seemingly doing nothing. The strange combat model ultimately makes it difficult to engage in the kind of tactical maneuvers you might expect from a game about Classical warfare.-Supply system that's heavy on micromanagement and light on strategic decisionmaking. The dilemmas and opportunity costs which should drive major decisions just don't exist here. Basically you're always trying to feed your legions in the field, and to do so you're required to individually create ""worker"" units, designate mines or fields for them to use, and then manually create supply routes to-and-from cities and outbuildings. There is also little UI in this regard - a list of trade routes sortable by destination/origin or some color coding options would help.Overall: 5/10. There appears to be no extra metagame choices offered by Hegemony: Rome's potentially interesting supply and resource systems. Instead we're left with a clumsy ""Warcraft:Rome edition"" that requires some mindless micromanagement on top of a stale combat system. I am looking forward to what extra patching and mods do to the game, but only the biggest strategy buffs should buy Hegemony: Rome in it's current state."

This is a game that really satisfies the tactical,strategic and operational side of any strategy player.The graphs are better than before and there is even a variety of faces amongst soldiers.Thre are tons of civil nad military buildings that can be built and/or destroyd according to you strategy (i.e. bridges,forts)There is a huge variety of units and each one of them has its pros and consThe terrain is much more detailed and plays a much more importante role, you have to build bridges to cross certain rivers and certain mountain pass only allow for one of your units to fight at a time.The interface needs a little work but its already 10x than the previous installment, requiring less clicks while not being dumbed down.I am also very happy to see that the developers really care about the community and it is open for suggestions, unlike the other guys(CA,SEGA). There is a MODS tab which suggests taht the game will be moddable, which needless to say, is an awesome feature.In summary, do yourself a favor and buy this game."

That wasnt the case, developement was stopped and I sat there with an incomplete game and 20 euros less. Dont make the mistake I did."
,Recommended,227060,11093122,"Posted: 5 July, 2014",all,nannerpuss,"Hegemony Rome: The Rise of Caesaris both a solid, fun game and a serious contender for the best 'Rome-based' RTS game in the last few years. Like the majority of others I consider theTotal War: Romefranchise to be the benchmark for this genre, and despite the bugs and gameplay issues Rome II had, it got better after patching. The originalTotal War: Romewas fantastic regardless. It may not be fair to compare the two games considering this is technically an indie release, but I figure even newcomers to the RTS genre have heard of or played a Total War title and it's the most logical (and easiest) comparison.That said, the devs here didn't try to mimick Total War by redesigning or borrowing its good parts. In fact this game is nothing like Total War. Rather,Longbow Game Studioschanged the focus entirely by making historical accuracy and in-depth resource management the two biggest components of Hegemony, and it works very well on top of the standard RTS framework. Hegemony is also far less daunting than Rome and Rome II. Players new to strategy games can jump into the campaign mode and start playing immediately*, but there's also enough substance to keep veteran RTS gamers engaged. The graphics are passable and run smoothly on the highest settings, and the cutscenes are just that - static scenes drawn with a ""comic book"" style to them. It's a nice break from the bombardment of massively rendered 3D action scenes that end up cheesy and unrealistic because of bad anti-aliasing and direction. The comic book art is also very mature, and there is plenty of violence and blood, which is a nice touch as well.That asterisk up there? It's for the biggest flaw in this game and (ironically) part of why this game is so easy to jump into: the tutorial system is lacking. You can jump right into this game as a new player and the tutorial will guide you, but you are going to have to learn a lot of the minute details by banging your head against the wall losing captured cities and dying often during the first couple hours. Even veteran RTS players will have to figure out some of the details by trial and error. The most glaring is the lack of explanation about hostages and captured city morale. After you understand it, it makes sense, but you will have to experiment a lot first. (Hint: move your hostages to far away cities. The game fails to mention that part.)Overall, this is a good game. Is it worth $30? Yeah, but probably only for Roman history fans and RTS fanboys in general. If you are brand new to RTS games you might want to wait until this goes on sale.[Update after a long, long break: They've patched it a few times and there's even a DLC out now, which shows me they do care about this game longterm. I'm about to play through again on Hard mode and am looking forward to it. If you read the early reviews about constant crashing, those issues seem to have vanished now. Keep that in mind when deciding on purchasing this.]"

76561197961800548,Not Recommended,227060,31326131,Posted: 23 April,all,Paslon,"Game looks amazing at first blush for someone like me. I love historical combat, I love the Roman era. Slam dunk right?Not so much, once you start peeling back the actual mechanics of the game you get pretty depressed at a wasted oppurtunity by the devs. Theres so many things that needed to obviously be addressed. Here are my top annoyances off the cuff.-This is a game where the entire beginning level terrain is mostly constrictive mountain passes. to this end, unit pathfinding is atrocious. You tell them to move through a pass wide enough for one unit and they will always attempt to deploy into some kind of battle line as if they were in an open field, which they rarely are.-the supply system is ♥♥♥♥ing byzantine. After reading tons of forums (the in game manual is useless) I sort of kinda figured out how it works. But you cannot see what the supply flow is, or how it is working. The game tells you ""make a supply line!""  with no explanation of how or why supply flows, stops, reverses ect. These sorts of things are critical to know, even in the first tutorial mission or you will find your armies melting away with no undertstanding why. It is a very large part of the micro in the game to manage stockpile rates, supply lines, ect. These are NOT things that can be hand waved in the first mission.-The alerts are♥♥♥♥♥♥poor. Once again you have long supply lines and you will be periodically raided in your rear. The only alert you get is a little drum beat that mixes into the drum beat filled soundtrack. So suddenly your armies are melting, you dont know why. You zoom out and realise your supply lines 200 km back are being raided for quite some time. Seriously?Again. Very cool and interesting concept. But a lot of basic interface Dos and Donts that gam designers figured out 10 years ago are missing. In a lot of ways its like playing games from an earlier era where you were just dropped in and told 'good luck'.  Every once in awhile I come back, load up the game determined to give it another try bc I like the idea so much. I always walk away after 45 minutes or so, never making it past the first tutorial bc of how frustrating the actual mechanics are. I would stay away from this title. Other Hegemonies have better reviews, start there first."

76561198036186446,Recommended,227060,13069735,"Posted: 24 November, 2014",all,Ca_Putt,"TL/DR: Mix of RTS and Total war that actually works. Also the frequent crashes many reviews mention(I had to set autosave to 5 minutes to avoid going insane) have been fixed in late October 2014, so consider this in your purchase evaluation.(!)Hegemony Rome: the Rise of Caesar is the Successor of Hegemony Gold: Wars of Ancient Greece which itself is sort of an Upgrade of Hegemony: Phillip of Macedon. All three Titles basically work the same so If you want to test the Game(or one of it's predecessors) any one of them(or a demo) will give you quite a good impression of what's going on.What's good about this game?1.) ... wait, you've read(or will read) other shorter/longer reviews, you saw the Trailer, you maybe even played Hegemony Gold. So I'm just going to skip this and go right to the bad things and you go figure out why I spent 100 Hours(jeez) on this game despite the bad points below, eventho I have like 200 other games in my steam account and a job that earns me enough money to buy said games ;)So what's bad?1.) Unit variety. Gauls/Britons/Germans all have the same old: Skirmisher(guys with swords), Slinger, Javelineer, Spearman and Cavalry. Gauls also get Archers, Romans only get Legionaries(strongest unit). Some subfactions get some statbonuses but most factions are essencially the same. I liked the variation in Heg. Gold, where Macedon, Persia, Athens, Illyria, Sparta, Nomads, Thracians and gerneric Greeks all had different unit-sets. They are however working on this and enabeling modding, so I'm optimistic.2.) The AI, while not particualry stupid*, has significant limits pertaining to it's inability to grasp the game, it does not train veterans, it builds buildings seemingly at random, it does not manage it's food supply properly etc. on the other hand this makes taking enemy cities less time consuming^^.3.) The forum is dead. If you got a problem, just ask here on steam, it's more likely to attract the devs, or other players for that matter.4.) In the Campaign you command Kaisars Gallic Legions. A common quest reward are extra Legionary Cohor... Brigades. As you play a special Campaign faction(and not the regular Sandbox Romans) you cannot train them yourself, in turn you cannot disband them, sounds ok sofar. However, to replenish these troops(and your Uber Archer and Slingerunits) you need Roman Population. Now where would you find that? In roman cities. Now guess how many roman cities there are in Belgiu... Belgia. One. An average city can sustain 2-4 Brigades. In essence, unless you only use low morale Gallic troops you are going to spend most of your time waiting for your Capital to recover it's pop. yeesh. Having ""culturechange"" as a rare Questreward as in Heg. Gold would have prevented this.5.) Workers/slaves cannot carry Food. Players of Heg. Gold will know why this is a bad thing, you essencially need to plonk down expensive camps everywhere so your troops don't die of starvation during a siege. That, or you upgrade your troops carry capactiy instead of Attack/Morale/Hitpoints/LOS/men per unit, and who wants that?6.) the Campaign ends with good old Cheese-R explaining his righteous struggle against the Senate and then whining a bit about his death. Something I find quite a remarkable thing to do for a corpse. Then again I find most non-rotting-related things quite remarkable if done by dead people. Also with the (horrible) intro movie showing him lead his legions over the Rubicon I would have at least expected a cliffhanger hinting to a sequel where he fights against the Senate, that or an optimistic but mysterious ending that incites young people to look up what happend to him on wikipedia just to discover his grim fate, that would have been neat, and cheaper.*it's actually pretty mean :("
76561198006621074,Recommended,227060,12950484,"Posted: 15 November, 2014",all,lllib,"This is very good real-time strategy game with big focus on tactics (unit types, facing, flanking, upcoming - currently beta tree - ambush system) and logistics (need to connect assets, such as cities, mines, farms, woodcutters with land or water connections, through which food and wood is transported, and depending on length/difficulty of connection, there is tax - longer routes cost more in gold, but also have % of wood/food/gold production lost).Another part of logistics is recruits - each city has capped amount of recruits pool, which regenerates over time. Your units need to be in supply range of fort or city with land connection to their home city to be able to draw recruits to replace casualties (further from home city, slower the reinfoircements. You can change unit's home city, but (probably) only within other cities of the same tribe.Big part of the game is unit experience, which is what will keep you playing mostly.You are member of particular civilization and tribe. Your native cities are loyal, but any conquered cities need either garrison buildings, garrison, and/or hostages put somewhere else to prevent it from rebelling (don't worry it's not too complex and you don't need to pay constant attention to it). Conquering another nation can mean getting their wood, gold and food sources, their recruitment pool, but depending on their bonuses you get access to units with combat bonus of their native faction or terrain capability of that faction, or even to different unit types (if you conquer roman city as barbarian, you get access to roman legionaires, which have very different stats).There are some differences between nations/tribes, some have larger number of native cities, others have some bonuses (meelee/ranged combat bonus, terrain-specific unit capability on recruitment).Amount of unit types is not huge - skirmishers, spearmen, slingers, cavalry, javelinmen, archers for barbarians, additional infantry and cavalry of roman factions. After earning experience in battle (or small amount on recruitment with some building upgrades build) you can (and should) spend this on purchasing officers for that unit, up to four (non-detachable) officers of four levels plus (detachable) general. These can provide significant bonuses to offensive and defensive capabilities of unit, morale, logistics, terrain-passage, siege, scouting, and probably more bonuses(typically you'll want combat bonuses first for meelee units, ranged bonus for ranged units). Generals work same as officers, but can be detached and moved to another unit or to govern some city (not sure about effects of that, maybe is still work in progress).There is lot of content in the game already, and game is very good, although there are still things to be done (AI is good in handling some tasks but not so good with others). Good news is that developers are working actively on the game, and judging from support history from original Hegemony game (which was focused on Greece) they can be trusted to do so for years and years to come.Compared to original Hegemony, there is less variation in units, because it takes place largely in homogenic area of Gaul."
76561198128692528,Recommended,227060,13336003,"Posted: 12 December, 2014",all,Fristi61,"This game hits the spot if you are interested in historical, detailed strategy.It is much less of an empire building game as, say, Total War's Campaign or Civilization, while also not quite as ""epic battle-centered"" as the Total War battles.Instead, it focuses more on the waging war in the ancient period as a whole, rather than just the battle.You're managing every aspect of campaigning. Keeping your units and cities provisioned through an extensive network of supply lines is crucial, and using natural borders of forests, mountains and rivers is important to maintain the safety of that very same network.Construct camps and bridges as resupply points or defenses. Take hostages to ensure the obedience of your subdued enemies. Keep your army in good morale. Promote officers and assign generals. Definitely don't get stuck in the Alps during winter, unless you want your troops to get snowed in and starve (I speak from experience :( ).Rather than focusing on just the battle itself, Hegemony Rome puts you in charge of ALL the decisions that a commander (such as Caesar) would have had to make whilst campaigning. All this on a truly gigantic map of Gaul (and some bits of Northern Italy, Southern Britain, Belgium and Switzerland) representing every major historic tribe and geographic feature.The game remains intuitive and attractive, however. Despite its scale, it remains overviewable through some rather unique design (zooming out from individual soldiers on terrain to miniatures on a parchment map).It also is absolutely unparalelled in its attention to historical detail, every city, faction and unit has a small in-game article of historical information that can be read. You could quite feasibly substitute this game for reading information on the Gallic Wars online.Hegemony Rome is quite different from any other strategy game out there. it is incredibly educative and detailed, while the basic game mechanics remain quite simple (though very different from other strategy games).If you are interested in history, and a detailed, accurate portrayal of what campaigning is like, this is the game for you."

It wasn't optimized then so I let it sit for a while. It is now decently polished, and optimized.The Hegemony series is in antithesis of the dominant form of RTS (Starcraft Style). It is a slow playing ballet that builds over hours where a handful of units can have a large impact and a single raid can cause problems for an unwary empire. The way supply and manpower are handled in this series is brilliant, creating a very thoughtful style of gameplay that I would love to see more often.The bigger your empire, the more difficult it is to protect it, and manage getting the needed food and manpower to the right place.The four story campaigns follow the career of Caesar in Gaul in exacting detail. You will invade Britain, you will cross the Rhine, and you will see your province torn apart by rebellion. By the end of it you will feel like you have conquered the place yourself, and maybe feel a little shell shocked at having to deal with pesky raiders constantly picking at your flanks.The game is by no means perfect. If you are not a patient gamer, or a thoughtful exploiter of gaming systems you may not enjoy it. The scope of the game might have been a little too ambitious for such a small studio, and it occasionally falls apart. It is slow to start, but that humble beginning only lets you appreciate the epic scope once you get there.Pros-Supply lines and manpower mechanics define how the game is played. Raids can be devastating, and concentrating an entire army in one place will often cause you to lose as you run out of food or your empire is picked apart by raiders.-New Experience System lets you specialize Legions, and even promote officers from veteran legions to lead others.-Flanking and positioning make an enormous difference.-You can built forts and bridges, and customize cities.Take it or Leave it-Siege warfare is brutal. Better plan it out.-Naval Warfare can be finicky-Not a lot of different varities of unit, however the differences become very meaningful as you learn how to use them,Cons-Slow to start-The supply mechanic is not for every gamer-Not as flashy as a AAA titleI will let it sit for a while longer then I'll try the sandbox campaign and some mods I think, then update my review. Good on you Longbow, I always hoped for another after Hegemony Gold and I am glad to see it.V,V,V"

Although without a dought the best battle simulation games on the market are the total war series. The properly consider weather wind, moral, flanking supprise, shock terrain etc. But while the total war series is great for battles it is not much for simulating wars.Gone are the days where every battle can be won by overwealming a tiny kingdom. Gone are the days were you can march troops without a consern of supply. The hegemony series simulates war campaigns. Trust me ensuring troops are properly supplied can be a task, as the enemy is always trying to mess with your supplies.Unlike in most RTS games the player will not win by overwelming an opponent the will by flanking them on a grand scale.The game gives some nods to tactical battles, but the terrain tends to be too crowded to preform them properly. Everything in the world feels squashed together at times. Effects that would effect a grand compaign such as weather are not present.The game is lacking multiplayer.

It isn't, but it's an enjoyable game on its own.  The learning curve was not bad if you've played things like this before-I read a review complaining about the complexity pre-purchase, and may I say, that player was wrong.  There's a manual in steam for the game (I have not read it, didn't need to).  Link cities to share supplies, like food and wood, keep your troops in supply zones until needed, build forts to create supply zones in necessary locations.  You can check your spending budget and make cuts, but I have not found an overall happiness meter.  Each city has its own morale you can boost with troops and such, if it bottoms out you could lose it to rebels.Now that I'm done debunking that negitive review... the game is good.  Not great, not worth full price, but pick it up on an xmas sale or black friday."

But it is surprisingly engrossing, with a slow-moving pace and almost hypnotic game play. There is a lot of emphasis on resources, the combat is ok but a bit dumbed down, and diplomacy seems almost non-existent. That said it is pretty satisfying to grow your empire. Game play seems to come down to gradually expanding your empire while avoiding over-extending, and very limited resources make every decision more difficult. Should you beef up your city defences or build a few new units? Invest in city buildings to build new unit types like Cavalry or invest in a marketplace to generate more income? There are lots of ways to play –raid enemy farms for resources, steal slaves from enemy posts, ambush enemy units etc, starve the enemy into submission etc.   The AI is pretty good, with the enemy launching attacks on your weak spots and retreating in the face of superior forces. There is a full fog of war so you never really know what is happening outside your territory.After playing the same sandbox scenario (as one of the Brittanic tribes) for some 30+ hours, and still being a long way from completion, I would have to say the game is starting to get a little predictable and formulaic. Position and strengthen your forces, capture enemy positions such as farms and mines, capture an enemy city, suppress revolt, recover from your losses, repeat and thus slowly grow your empire. That said it has been absorbing getting to this point, and the game has some nice touches - I can’t quite stop playing... yet.If you are a fan of Total War, Civilisation etc and this is on special offer then I would recommend it.Tips for new players: expand your realm slowly. The AI will hit you hard if you over-extend. Ships tend to sink in the winter months (put them in a city until spring). Upgrade cities to have the marketplace – cash is king in this game and is usually the main limiting factor to expansion. Capture enemy farms etc and send any remaining slaves back home to man your own farms etc. Capture enemy units and enslave the survivors. Captured slaves can be sent to a city and disbanded, adding to your own population to replenish your forces. If you lose a  unit, it is sent back to its home city where it will replenish. Mercenary units are useful, but do not replenish."

On the second scenario it would crash fairly consistently after the battles got very large.  If you have an AMD video card, probably stay away from this title.It was fun and refreshing but unfortunately it looks like it exited early access a tad bit too early.  It's appropriate because it being in early access was basically a scam anyway.  The publisher of the game is owned by Kalypso Media (creators of Tropico) and this is just a somewhat clever way for them to have pre-orders of the game with higher sales.  The early access ONLY involved testing out the first campaign of the game, which is basically a demo.

I figured they'd fix it.Sad to say the game is not fixed. It's better but it still crashes a lot.The frame rate is terrible. It's not just that the frame rate is low but that it jumps from 50-60 fps to 10 fps when you scroll in and out or try to move around the map. The game play is heavily based around seamlessly scrolling and zooming the map so this is a major problem. (It's not my pc, I can run Rome 2 Total War and Fallout 4 on their highest settings with no problems).In between crashes and frame rate problems I think it's a good game.

Don't get me wrong, it is a fun to play game, but has some drawbacks.-The game can be sluggish. You might want to reduce the graphics settings to get a smoother experience.-For one, the price is too high for this version of the game. I think too many improvements are needed to make it worth the price really.-The game is CLUMSY! at first. It deff. takes some getting used to. The zooming in and out of the map is nice, but it doesn't always transition very well. Clicking on units and cities take a lil precision with the mouse as well.-The tutaorial sux. It doesn't always guide you as to exactly what you need to do next. The little window that pops up explaining things (as in Total War series) kinda gets in the way of some info. Not sure how to close the window.-Graphics are ok, although somewhat dated.-Combat is very simple when compared to the Total War series. Although this is not always a bad thing.Has some nice features you do not see in other games. The integration of battle and campaign are done very well. Both are tied together on the same map... and things happen in real time. For example... while one of your legions is in desperate battle with enemy raiders, you can send more troops up from a different part of the map to help, or to engage another enemy. In otherwords... LOTS IS GOING ON AT ONCE!My advice if you get this game, TAKE YOUR TIME at first. Let the screens load, listen to the advice the AI gives you... don't get overwhelmed at the sudden influx of OBJECTIVES. Just navigate the screens as needed to get a grip on what is going on. It is not a game you can just jump in and start waging war."

The Hegemony series has so far shown to be deeper than most zerg-rush RTS games. It forces the player to think tactically about more than just the troops being thrown at an enemy. I have to constantly evaluate my situation on multiple levels in order to triumph. This is not brought about from complex micromanagement systems, as seen in ot6her titles. It is simply an organic result of focusing on the main aspects of building an empire such as knowing an enemies strengths and weeknesses, dealing with supply issues, and utilizing the available resources wisely. Taken all together, Longbow games have made long lasting RTS games that continue to challenge and satisfy far beyond what I have found in other titles. How well historical fact is woven into the game only adds to my enjoyment.

However, its gameplay very rapidly becomes repetitive, especially in the grand campaign, and somehow it manages to make an absolutely massive map encompassing the entirety of France and some parts of Italy, England, and the Lowlands feel small and congested. The campaign also disappointingly doesn't go onto Caesar's civil war after he's done with Gaul, which would've made for far more worthwhile DLCs than a couple of unit packs.The combat itself deserves a very specific mention as one of the few mechanical areas of this game that's actually bad. Legionaries break far too easily, and you can get crippling flank penalties from like two or three enemy troops bumping into the side of your formation.Ultimately, I don't recommend this game unless it's on sale.

This game is all about supply and logistics management and they have got it spot on.The AI is beautiful and attacks you in weak areas or cuts into supply lines if you fail to defend routes or knock out uprisings.

These are outstanding strategy games. If you enjoy Total War (I for one do; TW Rome II *eventually* turned into an excellent game with extensive patching), you absolutley should give Hegemony a try. The tactical combat is obviously less involved than Total War, but the strategic side is arguably deeper, with emphasis on things like logistics, change of seasons etc. The seamless transition between the strategic 'panned out map' view and the tactical 'zoomed in' view is lovely, and something TW doesn't offer. Makes for very fluid gameplay.The Hegemony games seem to go on sale pretty regularly, and even at the full $30 price ($20 in case of Rise of Caesar), they are *well* worth it (half the price of a AAA title, but in my opinion, every bit as polished than the big offerings of big studios). If you're interested in ancient world warfare. whether titles like AGEOD's Alea Jacta Est or CA's Total War Rome, do yourself a favor and take a chance on Hegemony.

The town development and the need for logging camps is a great improvement on the two previous Hegemony games as it allows towns to lose the feeling of sameness of the previous games. The biggest drawback is the same as the earlier games, the need to control everything. Caesar did delegate comand and the need to chase down every small band of raiders and repair and recapture every structure will lead to the same game fatigue of first two Hegemony games.

The zoom out to map feature is really cool and well done but it just doesn't make up for the rest of the game. Am I mad I bought it? Absolutely not, I got it on sale and for what I paid (I think it was like 80% off?) it was money welll spent. Full price though would have left me dissapointed and angry I spend the money. Buy this game on sale (like at least 50% off), don't pay full price."

Now i consider myself a hard on game rater. No i dont get hard rating games..... What i mean is if you rate something a 10/10 then it better be a perfect game, and you can almost always find a fault in a game.Great news though!! This game has very few!!! Actually really just one. Lack of unit varity and facton character. There are only about 5/6 different unit types in the game no matter which faction you play as. I would of liked to see a faction/ region unit. Like the Briton factions might have special archers while the Gual factions have good cav. Somthing like that.Besides that, I do love this game. They do a lot right, and for how ambious this game was they pulled it off. The lack of unit variety really makes you think about how to use what you've got. All and all great game.

I simply wouldn't recommend this game because the field isn't balanced.  The enemy will almost ways win one on one and you have to outnumber them.  If you are going up against one unit you need two.  For two units you need three units, despite them being experienced or not.  If you face six units you need at least eight or nine and the field becomes too tight for them to manuever properly.  Cities will rebellion against you even if you have hostages and five units which you will lose and having a 100% moral.  After all that i simply just didn't like the resource gathering.  I think it suppose to be realistic but it just doesn't work in making the game fun and allowing events to flow.  Money too is odd and what is up with sailing units?  Couldn't figure out why they immediately take damage as soon as they are on the water?  Anyways, don't waste your time or money...there are better games to be played."

The seamless map where strategic and tactical layers are fused together with smooth zooming that makes the gameplay quite enjoyable. In comparison to the old game its a lot easier to get income to support your troops since now you can build buildings and other city improvement where as before that was more dependent on the mines. Markets are essential for income. Walls are also a necessity. Forts nicely increase the supply radious so that you can expand faster then before and sustain your troops which is very authentic for roman times. Officer upgrades are also quite nice although maybe not as intuitive as one would expect.Small tip for people who don't know how to get food/wood/gold supply going. Capture a farm/mine/logging camp with troops or workers (slaves can't capture buildings - you capture the farm by left clicking on worker/troops and right clicking on farm) and then send slaves or workers in the farm/mine/logging camp (right click on farm). Left click on farm/mine/logging camp after you captured it and right click on city and voila your supply line is set up. The same applies for city to city supply lines (left select city + right click on the city you wan't to connect to). Its as easy as possible.The AI really depends on what kind of game you wan't to play and how you set it up in sandbox settings - don't just choose random. Playing as a roman faction (2 of them in sandbox) there is no certainty that you will win cause you have a legionary army. You have to flank the enemy and as such bring their morale down. Ah, morale one of the most important factors in this game. Watch out for food supplies when you attack or your troops will have low morale and break fast and then you will have problems getting more troops since your troops are dead and it takes time to get more recruited like in reality.One important feature of the game that needs to be used a lot in later game is active pause so that you can move your armies and assault different enemy cities, forts, etc. Afterall this is an rts game.People complaining about lack of diplomacy options - its the time of constant betrayal and warfare so its really not necessary to have sofisticated options especially since you sustain your economy yourself if you know what you are doing. Graphics - not really important to me as long the gameplay is good and I think that graphics that are in this game on a map of such grand scale (several times bigger then Rome 2 map) are quite good.Does the game have issues? Yes, there are several instances where crashes or some glitches occur but they are not very common and game breaking (autosave is implemented). At this point I still recommend saving as many times as you can. I know the company for a long time and I know that if there are issues in the game they will be patched out and the game improved but only if people send them dump files that they can actually find the issues !!!It took a long time for Hegemony Phillip of Macedon to become Hegemony Gold: Wars of Ancient Greece and it had similar issues that Hegemony Rome has but were patched out at the end. Basically they are like Arcen games when it comes to improving and fixing their games.What I like about this game are interesting, realistic formation battles, city improvements that make game more user friendly in comparison to Hegemony Gold and realistic morale and supply system in comparison to other games in RTS genre where you have your armies magically march through the whole map without any supplies and without any morale issues.As famous idiom by Napoleon Bonaparte says: ""An army marches on its stomach.""Just one more thing if you are expecting Rome Total War game from this - its not a Total War game so don't expect something like that or you will be dissapointed - its an RTS game of never before seen scale so it might be too much for a lot of players. I would still recommend the game at full price and over Rome 2 Total War at any time."

It's an attractive game with a wonderful map, some decent strategic options, a good basis for gameplay (it's a wonderful time period for war games) and has nice music. They did a great job with the historical setting and it has a complex recruitment/supply system that can take some time to master. There are a lot of things going for Hegemony Rome.It's also an exercise in futility and frustration.The logistics/supply system isn't well explained at all beyond how to link a city forward. There's no explanation of why this is important, how to do it well, how to link cities together and so forth. Building and promotions haven't been explained at all and I have no idea what they are. Needless to say, there's a learning curve with scant few resources from which to learn.I can get by that. I can't get by some of the gameplay. For instance, the second scenario requires you to take on 18 enemy units from Germany. There's no way my units can do this - they fold instantly and the TBS mechanics are awful so it's just a massive mob. Unlike the Total War games, this is just mob warfare.The real issue is trying to keep even half that many units in supply while raiders continually raid from areas of the map I'm not allowed to enter (and no, you can't station a unit at the entry point because there's no supply there), I've had one city mysteriously taken over by bandits TWICE with 2 of my units in the city and never any pop up that told me I was even being attacked.Those are all fundamental gameplay issues that have no business being in a final product. In one scenario we get balance issues, gameplay issues, UI issues...all rolled into one mess. Trying to untangle some of this might be possible but there's not even a manual. So about those concepts that aren't explained? You're screwed.That's not even mentioning the three crashes I encountered playing this battle.Come on, devs. You could have had a good product here. But you've got to do the polishing that's required. That means polishing the balance, providing the documentation needed by the player and fixing the bugs (rather than releasing new DLC)."

And this is where its very samey after one or two hours you likely have built every variation of unit and house you can. Wanted to like this game after watching it for ages but very tierd of this title very quickly.Really wanted this to be the true path of what rome total war 2 could have been but its even worse. The combat is a simple numbers game and doesnt seam to have a huge impact however you play it tacticly.

It’s a slightly upgraded version of 2003's Praetorian's by Pyro Studios.It boasts to be a refreshing change....with ""immersive history."" What you are get instead is:- Voice acting text boxes of dialog between generals) vaguely discussing the plot and movements.- 9 cookie cutter/inaccurate combat units, and 3 ""siege"" units, my favorite are ballista's and siege towers. Ballista's are built with siege equipment, but cannot be fired at cities, and siege towers which hold no troops, nor do any units graphically interact with them (they just sit there and give a bonus).- Graphically boring CIV IV environment-A storyline on rails with no chance of deviation or free will- Ridiculously boring, stupid, and predicable AI. An example of this is the games spawning of barbarians from inaccessible points on the map with almost stop-watch regularity....even though you have built a watchtower/camp defended with archers at their travel path that slaughter them instantly. The AI never stops, but you can’t NOT build it...because the barbarians will harass you supply lines. So it’s just a pointless stalemate.I could continue...but there is no point. There is a reason the trailer just has good music and ""cool"" roman monologue...because that’s the intro to the game...and it’s all downhill from there."

It focuses on tiny units and tactical strategy that it only does a fair job of making interesting, and that will only hold your attention for a few minutes.  There is no economy or anything else that would make this game fun otherwise.  So, it presents okay when you first look, but as you go into it, its just really incomplete, and not that much fun."

I bought the game based on the amazing gameplay and design of the previous game Hegemony: Gold. Hegemony: Rome however, since the release had many issues, including performance, pathfinding, formation and GUI. I did not like to review it in negative way until I see what the developers can do about those issue, and as today I can say it can be consider as a very good strategy game just like Hegemony: Gold.The basic design of Hegemony series is very creative and original, and for me it is the best historic RTS you can find on steam currently, it has the best supply system, seamless zoom and siege mechanism.For Hegemony: Rome specifically they added many great feature to the basic design of the Hegemony series, but did not change the basic formula extensively, for example the building and the upgrading of your city/ fort, the camps, and the bridges, plus the DLC of mercenary and ambush system.The only problem remains with Rome currently is the formation control, as it is not as good as the previous game yet, another issue is the terrains are very small, so big open field battles rarely happen.I would like to add that Longbow games are currently developing a new Hegemony game, taking into consideration the above issues.If you are new to Hegemony games, please download the DEMO of the Hegemony: Gold first, if you like it get this one.I totally recommend this game for any historic strategy games' fan."

Gather wood/gold/food, capture areas, and create a rather limited type of army types.

I'm happy I didn't pay the asking price it wanted $32.99 and happy I waited. I'm starting too find a lot of indie games just don't measure up to what they say they show gamers. Hegemony is really boring and very linear game play. Its just click and attack and the side effect of having no food or wood after having twenty cities just do a cheat and your good too go. The campaign is deceiving when you want to play as Caesar too conquer your neighbours beside you and you will run out of food and resources. What's strange is you may have two hundred of each resource but building implementation goes on a hold.You can run threw the campaign as Caesar and ignore everything else around you to end game. There is no balance when trying to feed an army that only starves in a blink of an eye.

For a 32inch 1080p monitor I kind of expect a little more leg-room buts its all taken up with these boxes.Secondly the mouse scrolling is not very friendly.  I'm used to games with a static scroll rate, and find myself pushing my cursor way past the sides, which the game interprets as 'I want to scroll FASTER!!!'  Pretty annoying.A wider field of view would be helpful.Needs some extra work on the AI.  One of my legion units split up somehow and one side got attacked which made them all rally, even though they were a good distance apart.Also finding my attack/move orders are often denied because of inaccessible terrain.  Like if I click on a cliff face the units will deny my order.  Would be better if they went to the closest point possible instead of just rejecting the order.I'm going to say no to recommending this game, only because its just not ready, no-where near ready (and the developers told me to be critical).  Buy it if you like the genre but expect some frustration."

Plus a brand new campaign, and this point is not negligible since the campaigns are really one of the strong points of the Hegemony series, but this could also have been done under the form of a DLC. Longbow is a small company which seems to fight hard to survive and meet their deadlines, so they cannot always realise their promises and their dreams, they do however deserve some support."
