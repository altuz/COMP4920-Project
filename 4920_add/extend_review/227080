This surprised me, because it is hard to tell a story with such complex themes under the guise of a game with any degree of success. Yet Papo & Yo handles it beautifully, and crafts an emotionally rewarding experience that deserves to be played. It certainly has its problems, but it manages to entertain and engage the player from beginning to end.Throughout Papo & Yo you play as Quico, a young boy who explores a dream like interpretation of Brazilian styled favelas. Throughout the game you are accompanied by three characters. The first is Lula, a cute yellow robot who hangs on to Quico’s back throughout the game, and serves to help him navigate and solve the puzzles that he encounters throughout his journey. There is also a girl who uses chalk to bring buildings and other objects in the environment to life, and more often than not plays tricks rather than help. These two characters are the ones that actively communicate to you.And then there’s Monster, a giant pink beast who grunts and roars as he eats and sleeps. Despite his outward frightful appearance, he is actually quite peaceful more often than not.Papo & Yo handles the complexities of addiction and abuse extremely well, never going into lengthy explanations or long, dialogue encumbered scenes in order to convey its themes. Instead, the game mostly relies on the actions of the characters and the change in environments and scenery in order to communicate, which is a very welcome change.Throughout Quico’s journey, he will encounter puzzles of varying length and complexity that obstruct his path. What is most amazing about Papo & Yo’s puzzles is that they involve the environment in rather stunning and wonderful ways.Turning a switch can result in a building gaining legs and moving to another position, pulling a lever could turn a building sideways to unveil a hidden set of stairs, and lifting a box can create and move giant crates that could be used at your disposal. The mechanics and feel of Papo & Yo also deserve praise. The jumping and navigating of the world feels natural, and I always enjoyed how Quico interacts with his environment. The favelas are simply stunning to navigate and explore. The locations feel like they have been lived in, but also are off just enough that you can tell that it is in an imaginative world. The sounds that the environment makes as you solve puzzles and move about are a delight to listen to, and credit must be given to whoever designed the ambient sounds found within the game.Papo & Yo is a unique game. It handles its themes extremely well, and the world is simply amazing to behold. Though the game is not without its faults, chief among them a lack of difficulty and challenge, Papo & Yo should be played at least once. Trust me, the journey will be quite worth it."

It actually feels somewhat like a kid's platformer, but there's more to it.After completing the game you'll learn that everything in the game is a metaphore for a very dark and mature subject.That aside, the game have really unique and artistic level designs and a fitting soundtrack.I have no problem recommending this game. However, the full price at 12,99€ do seem a bit high when the game can be completed in 3-4 hours."

A treat for the eyes, the heart and the mind. This indie game cleverly mixes metaphor with gameplay in an amazing, colorful presentation. The puzzles themselves are not too challenging, but still provide a comfortable feeling of accomplishment when you conquer them. The platforming could have used a tiny bit of tweaking though. But the game's real goal is to let you share the emotional journey of the silent protagonist. Unfortunately, as the entire game is a metaphor I don't want to explain it too much by giving away the meaning (sadly the trailers, while beautifully made, blatantly tell the hidden meaning so I recommend to interested parties that they do /not/ watch them). Still, it's hard not to emphasize with the pint-sized hero as he explore his magical world even knowing what is coming. Definitely one of the most interesting games I've played this year."

Just as there are books and movies that really have no real value other than being a fun ride, most games today are played simply because they are enjoyable. But when something like this comes around the corner and gives you a story that challenges your opinions and so clearly mirrors the pain we see in our lives, I have to take notice. This is a small story that mirrors the Big Story, and it's asking us to listen and learn.So go ahead. Play it with an open mind, and reflect on what you find. This game has a lot to say."

The story is very carefully revealed and if you don't get spoiled through reading guides or wikis, you'll be stabbed in the stomach with feelings. These aren't 'girly visual novel' feelings, these are 'I have never cried at a movie and I'm not scared of horror games; there's just something in my eye, please hold me' feelings. For some people, the topic may actually hit very close to home.On a gameplay note, the gameplay itself is actually fairly simple though it can be periodically frustrating if you don't know what to do. It's a short-ish game, taking about 4 and a half hours to complete if you get stuck only on a couple of puzzles. Definitely worth it, especially if you get it on sale. I've had the game for over a year and I don't regret purchasing it."

Guiding you throughout a dream-scape, parkour-puzzle sort of world is a series of colourful and dynamic scenes and puzzles that change the world around you as it unravels its truth. A calm, soothing, often upbeat and cheerful soundtrack rassures you venture deeper into the  world.The story of the game is quite short and took you on a slow but increasinly intense journey which really didn't make much sense on the first playthrough, small cutscenes didn't give away much about the story in the gameplay, but then the pieces all rapidly come together to reveal the dark truth which created a much different perspective on the second playthrough.You gain attachment to the main character who I believe is Yo, as you explore the urban maze through a childs eyes, and how the smallest things look different to a childlike imagination.The puzzles are not to difficult and the controls are easy to pick up.Recommend if you like puzzles, mystery, intrigueing storyline and beautiful imagery."
,Recommended,227080,31402010,Posted: 27 April,all,TurkBoy92,"Underrated artistic masterpiece. This game explores themes not usually seen in the medium. Of neglect, child abuse, growing up in a broken household. Without spoiling the game, all I can say is that if you like puzzle platformers like Ico, Lost in Shadow, rain, you will definitely enjoy the clever puzzles and magnificent art direction and sound design. This game will make you feel like a child again, with its creative level design and atmosphere. Reinvigorating a sense of awe, wonder and discovery only a kid could have. The game is fairly short and there is not much replay value except for achievements you may have missed on your first run and optional collectibles. It is rough around the edges and doesn't reinvent the genre in a way we haven't seen before, but it is a nice breath of fresh air in a market needing more 3D puzzle platformers. All in all, if you like what you see in the gameplay trailers, this game will definitely not disappoint, as it offers just enough content without overstaying its welcome.

Think of a TV series that finishes after two series or so while it's still fresh and the stories are worthwhile, instead of dragging on season after season trying to wring every last penny out of the idea. Papo & Yo communicates some very strong emotions and makes sure it gets the point across and then it ends. Simple and perfect. The graphics aren't exactly mind blowing, but if you're looking for graphics you're in the wrong place - Papo & Yo is about story and, more importantly, emotion.

Papo & Yo fits squarely into this category – it’s never bad, but it’s never more than simply okay either.For positives, I can easily say that Papo & Yo is a very pleasing game, visually. You spend the majority of your game time in a favela in Brazil, solving Alice in Wonderland-esque puzzles with floating platforms and clever mechanics which change your landscape in interesting ways. It doesn’t take very long to progress through, and feels mostly tight with controls and camera movements.However, there seems to be just a layer of polish in all aspects that prevents this game from being better than average. The animations are choppy, and some game mechanics, such as jumping puzzles, may not feel as accurate as other platforming games.The story is my main dividing point. Although the narrative is essentially a very dark memoir, everything that you really need to know about the tale is shown to you up front. When the curtains are pulled back for a big reveal, you are basically shown what you’ve known since booting up the game – the monster is your father, and the poisonous frogs that put him into an uncontrollable rage are bottles of alcohol. It almost seemed odd that they decided to spend so much time at the end of the game devoted to showing you this, as that is the outset of the game.To be fair, Papo & Yo has its heart in the right place, it just could have used a little more time to shine up what’s already there. However, this game is entirely skippable. Not recommended, unless you can find it as part of a package deal or it’s on a steep sale."

What You get in this title is about 3.5 hour of gameplay, which may not seem much, but it's one of those cases where what matters is quality over quantity. And the quality is spectacular, mainly because 'Papo & Yo' comes close to perfection in terms of merging beutifuly designed world, deep plot, and amusing gameplay relying on solving not-so-hard, yet satysfyingly clever puzzles.Chosing one from points mentioned above it's definitely the plot, and how it's told, that makes 'Papo & Yo' unique experience worth getting. The plot in which we guide Quico through dreamy land strongly resembling one of the south american favelas takes some sudden turn, as we experience more and more deeply methaphorical events culminating in one of the most touching story climaxes I've experienced.I strongly encourage everyone to give this game a try, I believe none of You will regreat this."

The puzzles are challenging, but even though I got stuck on one of them for a while, they never felt impossible, and once I got a hang of the mechanics (which was my problem), I really enjoyed trying to solve the puzzles.But the biggest thing this game has going for it is the story; the game tackles some heavy themes, and the story it tells is very personal to the Creative Director, Vander Caballero, and that really comes across very strong. It does a very excellent job of exploring complicated inter-personal relationships.And while I had no problem picking up on the metaphors for addiction, abuse, and the other themes, the game still explains itself at the end, and I really really loved that.It gets emotional; I ended up crying. The only downside to it is that I don't see a lot of replayability, since the game is so very story driven.But all in all, a wonderful game that is both beautiful, personal, and fun and engaging to play."

It just works.As for the actual gameplay, this is a kind of ICO-like gameplay, using different mechamisms (with the usual switches, levers and the like...)The nicest thing about almost all puzzles is the ability to manipulate the scenery, which is almost a living thing.This game is short (3~4 hours, more if you want to collect stuff), which is not a problem afaic, because why should story-focused games *need* 40 hours to tell a simple story ?

It's seems like he didn't have the patience for the simple puzzles and complained too much about the too few bugs, which were minscule.And then I read Kotaku's review, and it was spot on: This game is a must play. It's imaginative, graphically impressive, the narrative is strong, the gameplay is simple enough. There's not too much wrong with the game. In fact, the only thing wrong with it might be some PC optimization, but lowering the settings a bit fixes that.It was clear what the story was going to be about from the opening message and intro scene from the creative director and writer, a story about a boy with an abusive, alcoholic father. It's heartfelt and means well, but wasn't as inspired or hidden like how the masterpiece, Braid, shocks you at the end.The game acts as a puzzler/adventure with platforming mechanics, jumping and stuff. It's done well, but a bit on the easier side. The puzzles were....simple, I guess is the best way of putting it. But it came with enjoyment, which Mitch Dyer didn't find it to be. The soundtrack and audio design is well done, I mean really well done. I was in awe of the composition and layering of instruments. Animation was fantastic, as expected; animators in Montreal do tend to put extra effort in their work. The graphics are visually impressive, great texturing, modeling, lighting, the favelas of Brazil are a great sight and I wish I could have seen more.

,Recommended,227080,28322329,"Posted: 11 December, 2016",all,Dravvad,"Papo & Yo is not the first game developed in the story direction of childhood abuse or parental issues, though it is understandable that people with such experiences want to make stories with that focus.And that in a sense leaves me feeling uneasy about what I want to say for this game. It is the awkward borderline of judging a game for it being a game, and judging it for the overall intentions.Now, I know the review began with giving away the premise of the game, but the reason I was fine with doing so is because of an immediate flaw in the game. Within the actual first minute of Papo & Yo, right after starting a New Game, there is a dedication and following scene which give away the game's purpose. That destroys any surprise completely. I definitely think that the game should have been set up differently for an even stronger impact of the parallels/metaphorical world.Despite that, the game moved along properly story-wise with what the characters represent. And the general events that occur as well as the world's environment are very strong and unique because of how surreal things get. The graphics of the game are mostly well-done, with interesting setup of the favela you traverse, nice color for the world as it morphs around you. Towards the end of the game, some of the physical effects that happened to the map genuinely made me dizzy, which, while not exactly enjoyable, gave me the idea of how strongly I was grounded in the distorted world.As I said towards the beginning of the review, though, how I want to judge this game is not exactly balanced. Though I became quite invested in Quico (the main character) throughout a short game that took me less than 4 hours, that does not mean that the game was perfect by any means.In fact, the majority of the flaws were from its technicality as a game. The game is platforming and puzzle-solving. The puzzles as a whole were all extremely easy to find the solution to; but many were made simply annoying due to how you get around as well as the Monster's interactions. For instance, there are some places where the Monster is literally in rage, trying to hurt you, which is understandable for the story. However, due to your limitations, some of the puzzles with that end up taking a long time because the Monster easily catches you, can block your path and throw you around over and over, and so on. It's meant to be a challenge for some of the puzzles, but the ones where Monster is permanently angry tended to waste a lot of my time, instead of making me more sad for the child.Most of the puzzles for a good chunk of the game require the same repeated actions. Flip a switch here; run somewhere else and flip a few more; return to your original spot and flip the switch back. Grab this item; run away from the monster; throw it somewhere. The game didn't get that unique until some of the extremely surreal areas of the game, or the puzzles that allow you to move or attach favela houses to one another to create bridges and platforms.The platforming aspects of the game are also rather disappointing and need lots of cleanup. There are a lot of invisible boxes blocking you all over the place. Whenever I was climbing around or jumping across rooftops, for instance, I would very often find Quico hitting some invisible edge of the roof. Despite seeing his whole body being above it all, I would fall down and have to go back around. Or there were certain puzzles where I saw a way to physically reach an object or switch, but there was an invisible box floating in the air, intentionally preventing me from getting there. There's also graphical issues such as clipping, where Quico's body would be inside of a wall or through some object on the ground.There was also horrendous lag during certain puzzles, and also any time I would enter a new area or a checkpoint occurred. Literally, everything would just freeze up and move choppily for several seconds, until the game got itself together again. The frequency of this was quite bothersome, usually being every handful of minutes.In the end, there was a lot of disappointment for me in how Papo & Yo was a ""game"", in its playability. There is lots of frustration with technical glitches and certain bad puzzle layout to the point where it got me angry (which isn't common for me), when it should have only been the story evoking my emotions.Thus, I am on the fence in how to end this review. The point of the story is not exactly new, though the visual aspects and uniqueness of the world are interesting. The idea of the gameplay using Monster is also intriguing, though there are many issues as mentioned above.Since there is only a ""Yes"" or ""No"" in Steam, I guess I will give ""Yes"" a slight edge due to the world."

On the surface this seems rather silly and simplistic, but it is a metaphor for a very real and heart wrenching tragedy. It is highly uncommon to see real world social issues brought up in games, especially social issues which no one wants to talk about, but Papo & Yo does this beautifully. The core gameplay is a puzzle platformer. The puzzles are quite easy to be honest, and if you get stuck it has a built in help system. The world you are in is very surreal and fantastical (think Salvador Dali), and is set in a bario neighborhood somewhere in South America. The soundtrack in this game is just fantastic as well. You must play this game to the end, or else it will not make much sense.  While this is certainly not the best game I have ever played, it is by far one of the most memorable.

It's a meditation on abuse and alcoholism. It's pieced together with a real familiarity with and affection for the assembled look of Brazilian favelas. And it has a autobiographical tone that's nearly impossible to find elsewhere in games.The gameplay is decent. The setting and music are strong. But the real star of the show is Monster. The game couldn't exist without him. For a creature that says nothing and spends half the game sleeping, he's fascinatingly complex. You'll switch between trying to protect him and trying to escape from him at a moment's notice. You're trying to break his addiction, but sometimes you'll use that addiction to force him to do what you want. You'll find yourself clinging to the brief moments he shows some affection, even if it's nothing more than a half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥toss of football. You want to like Monster, though you'll repeatedly ask yourself if you should even bother. It's a juggling act, but you'll find yourself practicing quite a bit of cognitive dissonance as you go from puzzle to puzzle.The game isn't subtle in its metaphors, nor should it be. Think of it as a children's story about abuse. It's like Where the Wild Things Are, except instead of wild creatures as stand-ins for the anarchy of childhood, Monster stands for a child's perspective of the physical power, aloofness, and cruelty of adulthood."

The game is simple, easy to go through and solved the puzzles. Now grafically speaking, the game is just BEAUTIFUL, the environment where the action takes place is just AWESOME, living in South America, in a awesome city with lots of hills and house build on them one above the other kinda feel like the action is taking place in mi city even thoug it's a mix of several architecture cities in South america (Chile, Brazil, Ecuador, Bolivia) which makes it more awesome because it's the first time I saw this kind of environment in a game.

As for the game quality, it's all thumbs up, music, art/design of the game no complains here and the story is deep, you can notice that the director put a lot of efforts in telling his own personal story and putting it into the game, lot of emotions, I think you should be a grown up to catch the whole plot to understand it though.

Just explore your surroundings and try out a few things, watch what's connected to what, and you'll get it :) There actually are optional hints to discover somewhere within the sceneries most of the times too.Each level is a bit different from the ones before, getting more and more dream-like, and a few times suddenly turning into short sequences of nightmares that are symbolic but obvious at the same time, and will leave a lasting impression. The soundtrack does it's best to underline the atmosphere and never gets annoying.It might not be a very ""long"" game, and it makes you wish for even more levels and more of all these amazing ideas how one can toy in a virtual dream-like reality with an otherwise ordinary cityscape, but it's still well worth it's price :)"

Lacking in Interesting Characters or Puzzles.Genre: 3rd Person Puzzle Platformer TitleDeveloped & Published by: Minority Media Inc.Platform: Windows OnlyBusiness Model: Base Game.Copy Purchased by MyselfOverall Gameplay Thoughts & PreambleI was rather interested in giving this a whirl when it came out a few years ago. Fast-forward to this past week and I finally got a chance to try it out. Well, this game makes two major mistakes to me. First: the characters are given very little backstory or personality. You could swap in any person to fill the role of these characters and it would come off as the same. The other problem is the puzzles themselves. They mostly range from really easy to unnecessarily frustrating. Not even the good kind of frustrating, just time-wasting frustration. So, let’s dig in and talk about Papo & Yo.Story ThoughtsI've seen comments been made that the game’s story is subtle and full of meaning. I found that it was rather blunt and in your face with its themes about living with people that abuse alcohol. I mean, a shadow in the shape of Monster behind a guy, it’s just not that subtle. The toy getting destroyed by Monster wasn't all that subtle. I do recall that I wanted to know more about the main character, more about this mysterious girl who’s guiding you around. Instead, you’re given very little information. The story seems content to focus on one little part of the boy’s past. It's hard to get invested when you're not given any character to invest into. So, if I can’t get invested in the characters or story, all that’s left is the gameplay. And for the most part, it’s boring.PuzzlesA lot of the puzzles consist of getting monster from one place to the other using what few items and environment puzzle pieces you have at your disposal. Most of the time though, it’s climbing up ladders, doing very basic platforming, puzzling with levers, switches and buttons. Each puzzle is overly long and unsatisfying to finish. I can’t help but get the impression they were put in to stretch the game out. Especially when one particular puzzle has you climbing all over rooftops and platforms to collect around 10 pieces of building in order to finish it. There isn't a lot of nuance, its figuring out the quirk of the puzzle you've stumbled upon and then sinking however many hours the puzzle decides you need to until you finish it.PC SettingsIt’s got texture, shadow, AA, light shafts, motion blur, bloom, depth of field and all other graphic settings a 3rd person game requires to tweak. Most, however, are on/off switches but at least you have options to optimize your experience. Not that I think you’ll need to tweak with them much, the game isn't very demanding. You may need to tune up the gamma settings as the game seemed really dark to me.Final ThoughtsFinishing the game isn’t tough. However, this is one particular journey that I didn’t feel better for having experienced. I think the main problem lies in the characters themselves. I felt no investment into them, no reason to find moments evocative when perhaps I should have. It feels like this subject has been handled better elsewhere. Add that problem to the other problem of the simple, time-wasting puzzles that were far more frustrating than they should have been. I don't recommend this title. This has been done better.Read this review and more on A Paladin Without A Crusade"

But for the repetitive and tedious puzzle sequences it dulled the gameplay because I already knew what would do what and how it would be done.Don't get me wrong, the storyline IS there, but the fillers for what little storyline is present consists of moving gears and wishing your walkspeed was faster.The visuals are great, as well as the decorations, I was constantly exploring the maps out of curiosity and hoping that I would run into an easteregg (I found one near the end of the game).For full price, I do not recommend buying this game because it is quite short, and your money would be better invested in a game where you could spend many hours on.

I applaud what the creator is trying to do; even more so knowing its based on his childhood but, I think the game needs a better writer.Plot:The plot is about you letting go of your abusive and alcoholic father. Its not a bad place to start but thats all the game has plot wise. Very little character building or reasons to get attached to the characters.

Not that ambiguity itself is bad, but few people know how, and when, to use it. Papa and Yo uses it as a crutch because 'I guess' the writers could fill the gaps with something they thought was interesting? I dont think the ambiguity is needed as much as they used it.GameplayThe gameplay consists of puzzle platformers. They are very simple puzzles and it gives you hints if you get stuck. Pretty bog standard as far as these things goAestheticThis is where I feel the game wins. Its damn beautiful with creative use of the environment to assist the puzzles.

,Not Recommended,227080,29384364,Posted: 20 January,all,Kryyss,"Sometimes, things which are completely unexpected work really well together. For example, peanut butter and jelly (jam). When you think about it, those things couldn't really be any further apart and yet they work very well. Why am I going on about sandwiches? Because Papa & Yo's developers took two very different things, put them into this game and.... found out the hard way that they don't work together.In short, the concept was to tell a tale about a boy trying to cope with an abusive and drunkern father. Not a bad concept to tackle for a game which attempts to be a bit like Alice in Wonderland, but sadly they chose to make this a very dull and largely uninteresting, uninventive platformer. To begin with, how is platforming considered the best approach to a topic as deep and complex as child abuse? It's like trying to paint the Sistin Chapel mural with a ballpoint pen and call it a masterpiece. For the gamers considering to buy the game let me explain what you are going to be doing in Papa & Yo.In general, the levels are linear with a clear start and finish. They are actually best described as arenas since they are usually single room puzzles made to look like the shanty towns in southern america. There is some surreal scenary later on which adds some appeal but this Alice in Wonderland-style is only put to good use in a handful of levels, the rest are just dull. It is almost as if there were two level designers, one who was talented and one who was very inexperienced and you have to put up with content from both but the majority is from the inexperienced designer. I don't even think the game could be considered a puzzle-platformer as the 'puzzles' consist of running or jump to a spot and pressing a 'button' then doing this over and over and over. I'm not kidding when I say that you will not be challenged by any of the content in this game. A few twists occour here and there like pushing a trolley with monster sleeping on it to a specific spot.. so that is basically pushing a button too when you think about it. And there are invisible walls everywhere in this game and not to mention that when monster gets mad and throws you around, it is possible to be flung outside of the map and glitch into the void or end up unable to get back into the map again and forced to restart from your last checkpoint. The QA in this game really was terrible at ensuring it was bug free. On the one hand they use invisible walls to stop you walking off a cliff in one part of the map but within the same map on the opposite side you can fall to your doom. Consistancy people!In the end, Papa & Yo is just a simplistic platformer that attempts to bite off a complex narrative that is unsuited to the style of game used. It's incredibly short (less than 3hrs long) and not very entertaining at all. If you want to have a game with an interesting narrative and some good puzzles then I'd recommend alternatives such as Master Reboot or if you want platforming with storyline I'd highly recommend Contrast. Both of which are very entertaining games with far more duration, quality and content than this junk."

Different people will experience this game differently, if you want a game that is just about the action or puzzles, this might disappoint, but I found it to be an incredibly chilled out game, you can't die and the music is very well done, fitting the atmosphere without becoming repetative. The graphics on the trailer look really poor, but I was surprised by how nice it looked.When I finished the game I felt like it could have been longer with more puzzles, but at the same time, I played it through in one night and it was a cool little game that kept me entertained start to finish. In some ways, the fact that it's short makes it more enjoyable.If you can get it on sale then I recommend it, it's very different and if you can think of it loosely like paying for a film, in this case a puzzle 'experience', then it's well worth £8."

When the reason I have to see something is because it ""answers"" the question of ""games as art"" I additionally add a roll of my eyes. Part of this is because I'm a media snob, part of this is because ""indie"" games have been legitimately over-hyped in recent years, and part of this is because there is no question in my mind that games are art or at least they often can be.Papo & Yo was 2012's answer to the games as art question and I initially passed on it assuming that it was only getting hype due to being a) about substance and child abuse, b) foreign, and c) ""indie"" and not its merit as a game. I was wrong. Papo & Yo delivers as a game, an artistic endeavor, and a metaphorical journey in every way possible. With interesting puzzles, excellent art direction, and pitch perfect score, Papo & Yo leads you through a brilliantly imaginative, and malleable landscape all the while building the aforementioned abuse metaphor through interaction between the player and ""Monster"".Unlike games with a similar theme such as: Among the Sleep, Papo & Yo manages to explore metaphor as much through gameplay as through narrative. The central puzzle is always how to deal with Monster, docile one moment, but filled with rage upon consuming frogs, which he cannot resist. As the game progresses it becomes increasingly difficult to deal with the beast and the player and the character of Quico grow to understand that Monster cannot be sated and must be dealt with otherwise.Beyond the narrative or metaphor the gameplay in Papo & Yo is solid and enjoyable. Whether to prove to yourself that games can be art or simply to enjoy an fun puzzle adventure, Papo & Yo is worth checking out."

The puzzles require practically no thought whatsoever, it almost feels like a dull task to complete them once you've figured out what to do.  The game does have an enchanting, magical atmosphere – I especially liked the 'cable car'-like scenes and music which appear towards the end of the game – but the gameplay itself is weak and routine.I experienced extreme motion-sickness playing this game, to the point that I had to limit my playing to roughly 20 minutes at a time.  While motion-sickness induced by gaming doesn't seem to be very widespread, I feel that the creators could have paid more attention to the way the motion works in the game.My main issue with Papo & Yo is with the supposed 'moral' of the story.  The monster appears to represent the way the boy perceives his father when his father is in a drunken rage, but what is throwing the monster off a high point to his death meant to represent?  Is he metaphorically killing his father?  If so, what does this achieve for the boy when this will have no effect on his reality where he still lives with his abusive, drunken father?  Is it actually inciting patricide?  Is it meant to represent overcoming the need for fantasy?  I'm not sure, and I'm not sure that the creator had a clear idea.  A truly edifying ending would be one where the young boy learns to appreciate whatever pressures are driving his father to act the way he does, to encourage understanding and sufferance and eventually forgiveness.Another issue I have is why the story is set in a faux-favela?  The child appears to have a school uniform, suggesting a middle class upbringing.  Why would his fantasy world be based around the favela?  I think this could have been explained a little better, especially at the story seems to take such a prominence."

It was alcohol specifically, that made me decide. In the moment when he broke into a liquor cabinet and began to get drunk, (while of course being underage.), I was afraid. I let him get drunker and drunker, and when he was stumbling around and falling down, I got in my car, (which had his stuff and the stuff of the people who were with us.) , and I left and drove to his parents house. I deposited everyone's stuff on the front porch and rang the doorbell and told his dad where he was and what he was doing. Afterwords, I never looked back. I haven't seen him in years now, nor do I want to, but I just know, if I saw him again I could become friends again with him easily. But I took the harder route of not forgiving him and simply letting him go. The ending of Papo and Yo was a metaphor for an actual moment in my life, and it was one of , if not THE most, moving ending to a video game I have ever seen. Millage may vary for other people, but at least for me, I felt very moved. It was just like revisiting that moment again, but this time, I was able to let go more easily.

The monster likes bright orange coconuts and can be manipulated to go and stand at places that makes bright white magic happen.What's appealing about this experience is how this dream world is portrayed, and less so in how it functions.The box city is vivid and playfully represented; cardboard boxes being picked up will make houses fly and move about to be placed in strategic places for our avatar to step on in order to progress.Some houses will grow legs and move like cockroaches, others grow wings and fly.I find these houses and what they mean to the main character more appealing than what the game tries to make me feel for the monster.The monster is nothing but a tool for the main character to use in order to trigger bright white magic so that you can progress. I don't feel for the monster, and also with all this creative freedom that the kid has, why doesn't he make his way through without the monster? It means nothing to me as a player, there is no love.The monster might just have been a ball and a chain locked to the kids foot.And then when the frogs enter the picture, making the monster go inte a fiery rage when he consumes them, the monster's tediousness just increases making me like it less.And liking it less would be fine if there just were some moment before that that established some kind of positive connection, but that never happens.It would serve whatever narrative the game is trying to convey better if the monster was simply always there, following and being present without forcing me as a player to make it go places all the time.But instead the game is tediously forcing the player to go through puzzles that after repetition loses what the game is trying to say about the relationship this kid has with the monster, the world, the girl, the robot and cardboard houses.The movement felt when moving the character about is fluent and loose but comes to a chunky halt when the game demands you to yet again turn arbitrary levers in order to progress.Or to make the monster do more stuff for you. Again.I did enjoy what I played for the most part, with a little more thought put into what the puzzles could mean set to the context of what this boy is going through, it could've succeeded in saying something.'Papa & Yo' has heart and genuinely cares, but needs more thought on how to make the theme of the game correlate with the player's choices."

I'm not very good at any of those.  Because of that, I should not have liked this game.  But I did.  I liked this game a lot.The gameplay was simple enough that I could play through it without getting seriously frustrated by my lack of skill; but still challenging enough not to be boring.   The puzzles that did not involve jumping and timing were very clever, but for the most part still logical and intuitive once you got into the flow of the game.  There were a few odd moments where the puzzles did not make a whole lot of sense, and I was force to rely on a walkthrough; but very few (unlike so many modern puzzle games, where randomness is used as a cheap and easy substitute for cleverness).  The mechanics of the game are very entertaining in themselves, particularly once Lulu is introduced.The game design is beautiful; and the creators use of an uncommon setting was brilliant.  The third-world backdrop meshed very well with the fantastical elements; creating a seamless world with it's own unique and readily-identifiable logic.  The artwork is stunning, and the inclusion of works by actual environmental artists nothing short of amazing.  The similar use of third-world characters, rather than white Europeans or stereotypical fantasy creatures is similarly inspiring.  The music is beautiful, and in spots almost breathtaking, wonderfully blending traditional and orchestral sounds.  Atmospheric and fun at the same time.I would be hard pressed to find any flaws in the game.  If I did, I would say that parts of the ending felt a little out of place.  Some of the scenes and actions didn't make quite as much sense as they could have, and the symbolism is a bit heavyhanded; but that's still a fairly minor quibble.   The game is a bit shorter than most of its type; but too much longer and it would have started to drag.  The pacing never leave it feeling too long or too short.One warning is that the background story that emerges from the game is disturbing, becoming increasingly so the closer it gets to the end.  This is ultimately a story of addiction and child abuse; and is accordingly dark and sad.  Fortunately, the writers do not beat the player over the head with moralizing; and manage to balance the darkness with a keen sense of human resilience.I cannot recommend this game enough.  I picked it up at a huge discount during one of Steam's big sales; but would can easily recommend getting it even at full price."

The game deals with the trauma of these memories tastefully in a very unique, visually appealing world. The trailer shows you honestly what the gameplay is like; third person puzzle solving. The puzzles are very intuitive and accessible, and this game could be played comfortably by a young kid (who may well be the target audience).

,Recommended,227080,13541342,"Posted: 23 December, 2014",all,battleprincesss,"Exquisitely beautiful and deeply nuanced, Papo & Yo asks of its audience that they enter into a relationship with a monster, one that they're almost sure to regret.I heard of Papo & Yo by chance, from a friend. It's a small game -- with only about 3-4 hours of gameplay -- from the even smaller Minority development team, based in Montreal. With an August 2012 release date, it's also relatively old by game standard; I bought it back in June on a whim, torn between rave reviews by people I knew and a few spectacularly bad ones by games journalists (although, if IGN still counts as games journalism by the time anyone's reading this, I will be well and truly shocked). I didn't touch it at all until very recently.But Papo & Yo lives up to cult hype. Although relatively simple -- possibly too simple for anyone who doesn't struggle with puzzles and platformers the way I do -- the game's breathtaking environments, incredible soundtrack, charming cast and biting narrative are more than enough to compensate even the most ""hardcore"" of gamers. If you feel mocked by the quotation marks I put around that word, please feel free to send me one (1) mug of your tears, and possibly a signed Polaroid of you crying next to today's paper so I know that your pain is real, and that my general disdain for the ""gamer elite"" has found its intended target.Papo & Yo's lead protagonist -- Quico -- is a young boy buried in the depths of his own imagination, struggling to cope with the trauma of life with his alcoholic, abusive father. Based on the childhood experiences of creator Vander Caballero, Quico retreats from his father's abuse into a dreamlike version of (what is ostensibly) his own neighborhood. In Quico's mind, his Brazilian favela becomes a magical place where buildings can sprout wings and legs, and Quico himself can run across the rooftops and jump between them with ease, accompanied by his toy robot, Lula.At first, Quico's dreamy paradise is a perfect escape; puzzles are quick and fun, and interacting with the world is a beautiful, uplifting experience. But it isn't long before the Monster that rules Quico's conscious life follows him into his subconscious one, and begins to color the once-tranquil world of Quico's imagination with violence and fear.Truthfully, it's impossible to talk about this game without talking about the nature of abuse. The narrative is squarely pointed at it and as an abuse simulator, Papo & Yo is unnervingly effective. Having been in several emotionally abusive relationships myself, I saw my experiences mirrored onscreen. Monster is visually intimidating, but -- when calm -- actually takes on a strangely charming demeanor. He seems nice; a little gruff and bumbling but protective, scooping Quico out of danger when he gets in over his head, blinking up at you when you crawl on his belly, and even throwing a soccer ball back and forth with you. He's dumb and single-minded, but sweet, for the most part.But when Monster's temper flares -- when he comes into contact with anything that alters his mood -- he becomes a terrifying hellion, and anything in his way falls victim to his rage. When Monster gets angry, almost nothing can dissuade him from hurting you... and he WANTS to get angry. He pursues the thing that drives him into that fury more doggedly than he pursues anything else. Soon you're not just trying to avoid letting Monster get angry, you're bracing yourself for the inevitable. 'When will he get mad next?' you start to wonder. You become more vigilant -- both of Monster's behavior and your own -- because it isn't a matter ofifsomething will set Monster off again, but a matter ofwhen.At a certain point, Monster's temper isn't just something you fear; it's a fact of life. You have to be aware of him at all times, and you can never leave him to his own devices for too long. It becomes tedious managing him all the time. Monster hurts you when he's angry; he hurts people you like, and destroys things you care about. You can't get rid of him, but he's becoming something you can no longer bear to live with.There's something to be said for the way Papo & Yo brings you through this cycle: from meeting the person to meeting their insurmountable problem; to taking that problem on as your own and being weighed down and exhausted by it; to beginning to fear and loathe the person for all the harm their problem is doing to you; to eventually wanting that person gone more than you feel obligated to them. I've lived that cycle several times, and being brought through it again by the game felt organic and real. For this exact reason, I can't bear to play through this game a second time; there's a few achievements that can only be earned on a second playthrough, and due to the realness of what I experienced, I don't anticipate ever going back for them.The narrative is clearly where this game sings; gameplay is where it often sighs. There were a few key moments where I felt railroaded into interacting with Monster and his anger. I personally liked how incredibly forgiving the gameplay was -- to my knowledge there arenofailure/death states -- but jokes aside, Idounderstand why some players have found it less than engaging in the past. Puzzles are relatively easy to solve and sometimes a little tedious as a result. Platforming in 3D is, as always, a little clunky, especially when jumping between platforms. Gameplay is very obviously second fiddle to the story Papo & Yo strives to tell, and although the mechanics in interactions with Monster feel very cohesive and in service of the narrative, most of the platforming segments do not.But, despite being less narratively resonant than desired, overall I found the platforming segments pretty fun. Part of this is that the platforming enhances my understanding of Quico as a child -- it's generally playful and inventive, combining both common, visible objects and imaginary, fanciful ones, something which is relatively common among children Quico's age. The world becomes his playground, even in moments of great peril at the hands of Monster; there's an emphasis both in gameplay and in narrative that Quico isn't mentally, physically, or emotionally equipped to cope with or retalliate against his father's abuse. His only choice is to make up a story where he can survive it more easily. It also drives home what I think is a very important point: abuse follows abuse survivors everywhere they go. Abuse affects you so deeply, that Quico's incapable of even imagining a world without it.Ultimately, I think the mechanical/narrative discordance in Papo & Yo is minimal. It might be more noticeable if the game was longer, but if you sit down and marathon it in a single day (which is completely doable), I doubt you'll think twice about it. Papo & Yo is a bold, powerful game, and has a lot of incredibly important things to say -- I recommend playing it immediately."

Papo & Yo will not only present you with interesting puzzles and fun gameplay, but also challenge you to look inward to the demons we all battle throughout life (and more importantly the places we go to escape them).This is a game about a boy named Quico and his seemingly magical action figure Lula, as well as a giant - and normally docile - beast named Monster. As Quico, you will explore various facets of the dream-like favela he escapes to, where the laws of reality itself bend to the whim of one little boy.The core gameplay focuses on solving environmental puzzles, many of which involve magic chalk-like drawings on the walls and floors of buildings that let you manipulate this strange and beautiful world in a variety of different ways. There is also some light platforming and some interesting mechanics which involve Lula, who straddles your backside like a knapsack and acts as a sort of jetpack that can also carry out some basic commands (such as flipping switches for you at a distance). Monster will also play a big part (no pun intended) in solving a lot of said puzzles and offers his own unique mechanics; when he is asleep his massive gut can be used as a trampoline of sorts and of course that brute strength of his also comes in handy! You have to be careful, however, as Monster also has an unhealthy addiction to poisonous frogs which cause him to burst into flames and go on a rampage!All in all this is a refreshing take on 3D puzzle-platformers, that also reminds us just how beautiful and robust the Unreal Engine can still be when in the right hands."

From the level design, texture quality, and unique animations to sound design to the beautifully crafted narrative of which the game is focused, nothing fails to impress. The gameplay is based around puzzles/platforming in a three-dimensional environment. The gameplay does not present much of a challenge but the controls are solid and intuitive, playing great with gamepad or keyboard/mouse. The music and ambient environmental sounds are immersive and calming, allowing for a stark contrast when the narrative calls for it. The narrative deals with themes of addiction, abuse, and denial through excellent use of imagery and symbolism.Everything fits together amazingly well in this game. It's rare to find a game that so excellently parses mature themes without resorting to mindless violence. I've been playing games for fifteen years, and I can honestly say this is one of the best.

The description makes the game sound like a bright, cheerful, Boy and His blob type game. It's not.Watch the launch trailer to get a better feel for what the game is about.*SPOILERS*I don't want to give too much away, but here's the jist:The game is an intriguing and harsh look at alcoholism, anger, neglect, child abuse, and even murder, through the eyes of an innocent child who, being unable to understand these things, creates a fanciful world they can escape to and make sense of them in their own way.The monster altogether ignores you throughout the experience, try as you might to interact with it, like a neglectful parent. When it's not ignoring you, it's eating or sleeping. It only pays you any attention when you have food, or when it is actively trying to harm you. Yes, it ""helps"" you solve puzzles and progress through the game, but you're not in anyway develping a friendship with the monster.The world is breathtakingly beautiful, with some really innovative and engrossing level design. There's a lot of detail in the mystical favela landscape, and exploring it is equally as enjoyable as the controls are tight and responsive.The game moves very fluidly with excellent pacing and hitting all the right emotional cues. The music is also top notch.Overall, this is a very polished game, and an excellent experience. The whimsical setting and levels juxtapose perfectly with the deeply emotional and dark subject matter. If I had any complaint, it's that the jumping is a little shoddy at times, and since the game has such an emphasis on platforming, that's a bigger deal than it should be. But that doesn't take away from the overall experience.Definitely reccomend it to anyone who likes to play games with a good story, a lot of emotion, and a lot of layers. The fact that the controls are great and the graphics are fantastic is merely icing on this bittersweet yet delectable cake.9/10"

The bright, colorful design of the favelas instantly caught my attention in a market saturated by grays and sepias. It stood out, it was new, it was charming. I picked it up, played it for a short while, and then set it down for a week. This should not speak poorly for the game but, rather, for my lack of attention. It took a little bit to get started. But when it did get started, oh man. It got started.I have since finished the game, and I can now safely call it one of the most important games I have ever played. Not because of anything that it does in the gameplay that is new. The gameplay is only ever average, an affair of finding gears to push and plungers to pull. It has its difficulties - the frame rate will sometimes skip for no reason, and the platforming elements feel strange. Quico, the protagonist, has a strange weight to him, making jumping a bit of an unusual effort. The gameplay is the weakest part of this game.But it is everywhere else that it shines. It can be terribly dazzling when it wants to be, offering a magically real landscape of favelas that twist and turn and defy gravity, and houses that walk on legs made of chalk, and an enormous pink monster with sun-cracked skin and a dangerous addiction to tropical frogs.And for every wonderful moment there is a counterpoint, a realization that this experience is inspired by Creative Director / Writer Vander Caballero's relationship with his alcoholic father. Later in the game Monster finally gets his hands on one of those irresistable little frogs, and gobbles it up. He is instantly wreathed in red flames, and he turns on you with a stomach-gnashing roar. Poor little Quico suddenly seems very small against the rampaging Monster, very fragile.The story's focus is on Quico's quest to cure Monster. You go on a journey to find a shaman, aided by a mysterious girl and an endearing toy robot named Lula, and of course Monster. Sometimes things go quite well. Sometimes they go very wrong.There are moments were Papo & Yo is absolutely childlike in its wonder.There are moments that are dark and threatening. And there are moments where you have to do things that are painful and liberating. This is a game of powerful, startling, painful moments, strung along to lure you deeper into its narrative.I feel Papo & Yo is best experienced in a single sitting. The puzzles never become inhibitingly difficult, and you can finish it in about 2 - 4 hours. Which, honestly, you should.If you want to know more, read the reviews put out by Rock Paper Shotgun and the New York Times."

At least there's no death, so messing up is  just a minor annoyance.  A few trippy moments. Controls are a bit wonky, but not game breaking.The story was fairly dumb until near the end, when the allegorical cues start to fall into place. Bittersweet, and made the journey worth it. Probably won't play again, not much replay value here.8/10"

76561198047023309,Recommended,227080,29173919,Posted: 10 January,all,Envi,"Pros: young black male protagonist, beautiful world to explore inspired by Brazilian favelas, In-game graffiti graphics licensed from real Brazilian street artists, meaningful narrative of addiction, violence, and child abuse.Cons: frequent unit clipping, the finicky camera can be frustrating to wrestle with at times when trying to solve a puzzle, a few puzzles were overly tedious and drawn outOverall: 5/5From authentic storytelling to delightful puzzles, Papo & Yo does so many things right. An innovative narrative game by Minority Media, Papo & Yo captured my heart and tore it apart. Though the puzzles themselves may not be exceedingly difficult, this is no easy game to play. It puts us in a whimsical world while exploring the emotional depth and complexity of loving and fearing a father who is an abusive addict.Set in a fantastical recreation of the favelas of Brazil, this game follows a young, black school boy as he escapes into this magical world. Throughout the game, the environment is adorned with street art licensed from real street artists in South America, placing us in the veritable sublimity of magical realism. Inspired by the lived experiences Vander Caballero (creative director), this game tells a story of survival, imagination, and love.The development of this game is inspiring; from the diversity of the team itself, to the shoestring budget, to the heart in getting the characters just right, this game earnestly taps into the power of the video game medium as a highly engaging, emotional, and intimate form of storytelling. Papo & Yo unapologetically makes things personal, painful, and profound.Story & CharactersIn the game, we play as Quico, a young, black boy who escapes from his alcoholic father by running away into a magical, wonderful world full of stacked, boxy buildings and urban oases of fruit and waterfalls. In this world, we meet Alejandra, a master of magic and whimsy, and Lula, our treasured toy come to life. Quico finds mystery and curious puzzles around every corner, but even here, his abusive father haunts him—in the form of Monster.Monster is a simple, soft, towering creature that loves the glowing fruits that are found throughout the world. He is easily led around the map, enticed by the giant fruit, and he helps us open doors and portals alike. His fatal flaw is his addiction to poisonous frogs. Whenever he eats a poisonous frog, he is overcome with a fiery rage, transforming this whimsical setting into a hellish nightmare. Metaphor? Check.As we venture farther and farther into this fantasy, we face the inevitability of destruction that Monster brings and learn to juggle the usefulness, selfishness, and recklessness of his rage. Together, Alejandra and Lula help Quico navigate his complex relationship with fear, care, and hope.Violence as a Mechanic for EmpathyWhen encountering violence in video games, the physicality of violence is often used in a sensational and/or desensitizing way. Beat-em-ups and shooters typically try to make violence fun, funny, and/or repetitively dull. Papo & Yo manages to frame violence differently. This is not a nonviolent game; in fact the violence in Papo & Yo is one of the most gut-wrenching I have ever experienced, even though there is no blood, gore, or kill shots. Still, whenever the enraged Monster attacks and tosses Quico, his screams and ragdoll body convey the most powerless and hopeless feeling that would sink right through my stomach.Papo & Yo successfully employs violence as a mechanic for empathy by depicting it as inevitable, abusive, and complicated. Instead of awarding acts of violence to the player for shows of power, this game puts the player in the shoes of someone who survives and lives on after acts of violence are committed towards him and his friends.Hyper-violent games often claim to be portraying the events and violence of real-world happenings. However, more often than not, this excuse only glorifies and desensitizes the brutal and graphic slaughter of women and people of color, rather than actually shedding a light on the reality and widespread problem of femicide and the dehumanization of black and brown bodies. In contrast, Papo & Yo uses violence to humanize and illustrate the trauma and complexity of abuse.MonsterI always have a soft spot for dimensional and well-designed villains.Monster is a hard creature to hate. His tall stature makes him physically intimidating, but his sleepy demeanor and warm color tones also make him cuddly and lovable. Cartoonishly bouncing on his tummy is delightful and funny, but each dawning of his fiery drunkenness makes my stomach sink.It’s also hard to hate him because he’s such a critical part of our success in each puzzle, even though he is also the source of many our problems. One minute, he’s trying to kill us. The next, he saves us from a crushing death when we don’t get a puzzle quite right. The cycles of support, rage, abuse, and calm mimic so closely the experience of living with and loving an abuser.Often, in fiction and fantasy, villains are flat caricatures of evil and cruelty. However, in reality, people are rarely so singular. Abusers are often charming, kind, generous, caring, and even vulnerable individuals. After all, they need as many ways as they can to keep their victims attached to them. Positive characteristics never preclude a person’s ability to be manipulative and harmful to others.This dimensional portrayal of an amiable abuser successfully captures and brings to life these complicated and entrapping behaviors that are all-too-familiar for survivors. It’s an honest and validating representation, and a rare example of a well-translated metaphor of abuse.Gameplay & PuzzlesThe puzzles in this game are not exceedingly challenging. While solving each puzzle remains satisfying, and interacting with pieces of the world around Quico is enchanting, the logistics of each level are not particularly ingenious. It doesn’t help that the camera is finicky and the frequent clipping of characters sometimes makes it difficult to discern what is and isn’t intentional. A large number of the puzzles can really be distilled down to a lever being pulled here revealing another switch to be turned there. As the game progresses, the puzzles don’t become more difficult—just more tedious.And boy were some of these levels tedious. Watching a building or water tank fly into place with cartoonish wings can be delightful only so many times.For me, the environmental interactivity partly makes up for the repetitive puzzles, and I found the progression of the game to be a worthwhile study of what difficulty can mean in a game. Emotional pressure, as it turns out, is an exceedingly effective way to raise the stakes.The journey and fulfillment of this game does not come from its puzzle solving. The challenge is not in the puzzle but rather in concentrating on the problem as a fiery Monster chases after Quico and flings his small body mercilessly until we find a way to calm him down. The duration of the game isn’t spent gearing up for a boss battle but rather evolving an understanding of Monster’s condition and fate.ConclusionPapo & Yo reimagines the ways in which a video game can challenge its players, tell stories of pain and love, and create a world of whimsy and light. This game blends magical realism seamlessly into this narrative of abuse, hopelessness, and trauma. How wonderful and natural it is that this game, directed and written by an abuse survivor, with the art of real Brazilian street artists incorporated into its favela-inspired world, developed by a team made up largely of poc and women, would blossom into such a resonant and powerful work of art."

It definitely struck a deep chord. T.TCons-Sometimes if you stand too close to an object and move the camera, everything goes black (this could be a graphics card issue though?).-I wanted to explore more than i was allowed to. I really liked finding the doll in each level and wanted more hidden treasures.-On the short side, I spend a lot of time trying to explore and messing around and I finished it in less than 6 hours.I purchased this game on sale and I am glad I bought and played it."

The platforming can be a bit stiff, although fun, and the puzzles are mixed. Some puzzles are fun while others feel tedious. I'd get the game during a sale, but it's definitely not a bad game. 7/10."

Although many of the areas in the environment felt closed off and not conducive to exploration, the puzzle mechanics rose to the surface and succeeded in captivating my attention. Particularly the dream like sequences, and dream-infused interpretations of the character's father, his rebirth in an imaginary monster, were standouts. Papo & Yo approaches narrative excellence with its devastating final message, which will no doubt resonate with anyone who has had similar expereinces. An extremely moving, thought provoking game that masks an inordinate amount of pain. Well done."
,Recommended,227080,31044519,Posted: 9 April,all,Jaunty,"The platforming was just how I like it; impressively responsive and not relying on testing how finicky you can be in testing its parameters but instead putting you in environments that test your nerves instead.The story was very delicately told and Papo and Yo is far from a Super Mario game in its setting; exchanging cute and colourful for natural tones, abstract, moody and cinematic its very Alice in Wonder Land at times with loads of resonating character it all very surreal. There are some adorable moments; your interaction with chubby big eyed frogs, the hint boxes were the best execution I have seen for giving a hint to players in game, and the characters themselves have much more depth than I am used in any video game.Papo and Yo is strikingly original at times and if there is one thing the majority of its reviews agree on its that Papo and Yo's strongest point is its a charming and eloquently told story that is of something the medium desperately needs: something to contemplate and something human."
