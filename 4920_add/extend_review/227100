There are no plot twists, or emotional dialogues to be found here.  Instead, this game delivers exactly what it promises, an army of Nazi zombies.  What could be more satisfying than this?  Who better to vent your daily frustrations on?  These are not your unfortunate neighbors, family or friends who have been transformed into the walking dead ... no ... they are undead Nazis.This game is about blowing the crap out of undead Nazis ... period.  Not only that, it also allows you to experience the crap-blowing up close and in slow motion, following your speeding projectile as it snaps bones, punctures organs and otherwise eviscerates the unending legion of menacing corpses.If you enjoy the idea of purging the world of demonic Nazi zombies, then this is the game for you!"

No other zombie game has managed to replicate the dread and imminent doom of the Romero-style zombie""I've never been good at stealth games. I've also never been good at driving games - blame it on my Asian heritage.When I played the original Sniper Elite V2, I loved the World War 2 setting, as well as the simulated realism of Sniper Physics -- distance to target, bullet drop, wind, holding your breath to steady your shots. I detested the stealthing segments, throwing rocks and scurrying about. I would try the stealth approach 3-4 times, give up in frustration, and go very loud and turn the game into a shooting gallery as enemies attempt to find me, with my back against a wall and all approaches covered. Ultimately,  the original Sniper Elite V2 wasn't for me -- that's not a knock on my game, simply just a mismatch between my playstyle and game preferences.Sniper Elite: Nazi Zombie Army was everything I loved about Sniper Elite V2, with an amazingly well-crafted zombie atmosphere. No other zombie game has managed to replicate the dread and imminent doom of the Romero-style zombie -- Left for Dead's rage zombies scamper towards you in waves but drop like paper mâché; Dead Island's zombies are sparse and require a lot of physical damage; Dead Rising zombies ignore you most of the time.  SE:NZA sticks you with the great conundrum of taking the time to properly aim for a headshot, at the risk of the other 10+ zombies getting closer. No other game has induced the same sense of panic when you realize just how badly surround you are -- they're just shambling slowly, how could I possible be surrounded?The stages themselves are very linear, albeit with extremely large areas for each major wave of attacks. There is room to kite, until the special zombies begin to appear. The suicide explosive zombies felt very unfair -- they're very difficult to deal with if playing single player, given the damage they deliver.  The resurrected skeletons are also a nuisance, but I suppose they force you to reprioritize your plan and backpeddle while shooting.The fifth area ""fetch quest"" in the subways was a chore, needlessly extending the game. I did enjoy the fact that these stages are all created from the base Sniper Elite V2 stages, but with much more fog and blood splatter.Picking up this game at $15 for a 4-pack was a steal, and kept my group of co-op friends occupied for a good two weeks, running one or two stages a night.  There is a lack of replayability -- in fact, I've yet to finish the game, due to the difficulty spike of dealing with the last boss -- which tends to play much better with three players than two.I can recommend this game for people who are not looking for a hardcore challenge, but rather, a ""beatable challenge"" with their friends. ~$4 is the right price for this game, but definitely do it with similar-minded friends."
,Recommended,227100,7776343,"Posted: 26 November, 2013",all,Fiona Marlowe,"If you haven’t played anything in the Sniper Elite series, what sets them apart from other run-and-gun shooters is the emphasis on over-the-top sniper shots with x-ray cams. The kills feel incredibly satisfying and the reliance on accuracy pushes one to enhance their skill and experiment with the weaponry to find the best player method. What is NOT here is the stealth element of the previous games, nor is it missed.If you’ve played other zombie games, like Killing Floor or Left 4 Dead, this series emphasizes limited weapon selection, each with different strengths and weaknesses. It also emphasizes slow shambling zombies over fast-moving ones. The mood is set very well in this game, as it does a good job of providing a feel of a destroyed hellish zombie-infested landscape. It is sufficiently creepy, particularly because you know that survival depends on seeing them first and getting a good distance between you and them. As they shamble closer, accuracy matters more making it harder to pull off shots when it matters most, complimenting the major strengths of this game.No doubt, you’ve read some criticism of this game. Some of the most prominent criticisms are condensed as follows:Cheap and unambitious.Monotonous and repetitive gameplay.Cashgrab.Unoriginal.No plot.While some of these are accurate to a degree, the reality is that even if they *are* true, it shouldn’t scare you away from this title. It is very fun with four people. I could go by each and refute them point by point, but most of these concerns can be alleviated by two counterpoints.First, this game *is* cheap. The game is $15.00. The average movie ticket is between $7.84 and $8.38 (as of November 2013). At 1 Hour and 30 minutes as the average length of a film, if you get even three hours of enjoyment out of the game, you’ve already gotten more out of it than your average movie (and you can bring your own snacks and be as loud as you like.) It’s not meant to be some gaming magnum opus, and many Triple A releases try too hard to do this, and fail miserably. This is what you might call a “niche market” game… its aimed at a small segment of the gaming community for a modest profit. This is not a bad thing nor is it any more a cashgrab than any other game produced. While it is not for everyone (nor is it meant to be), it is worth the price of admission.Second, as far as repetitive gameplay, yes it does have this. Every game is repetitive within certain respects, and the lack of a compelling plot or original gameplay elements makes this title’s repetitive nature relatively obvious. You *can* turn off the x-ray mode if it becomes overwhelming (or reduce its frequency) and the repetitive aspects are alleviated if you play with friends. The solo game mode is best enjoyed in small chunks. The shotguns function as shotguns, the sniper rifles function as sniper rifles, and pistols function as pistols. If you get tired of mowing down zombies with these methods, there are relatively few shooter games that will overcome this limitation. However, one should not expect too much innovation from a shooter game. There are precious few shooters that are innovative with regard to combat mechanics, or they’re successful at dressing up this shortcoming by using non-shooter elements. Much like the title implies, what you see is what you get… and what you get is pretty reasonable and fun in the right mindset."

,Recommended,227100,9790750,"Posted: 11 April, 2014",all,ownosourus,"Sniper Elite: Nazi Zombie Army is a stand-alone expansion and as such should be treated. In short, do not expect a new installment in the Rebellion franchise with plot, characters, missions and stealth oriented gameplay. The final score is just an average of the single-player experience.If you can, try not to play this game by yourself. As a single player game Nazi Zombie Army can become horribly monotonous. The crippling condition that makes the experience stale and repetitive is quickly remedied by the presence of buddies.Whilst there’s little in the way of tactical depth to sustain the action beyond the initial rush, Rebellion’s sniping and killcam mechanics remain an interesting and satisfying prospect in the short-term."
,Recommended,227100,7776266,"Posted: 26 November, 2013",all,AestheticGamer,"I actually enjoyed my time with this game. I will admit I was initially a bit off-put by the nazi zombie theme (how often have we seen that in the last few years?), and the appearance that it was a cheap cash-in on Sniper Elite V2's engine (and in some ways, it is), but it actually is a fun little romp with some nice varied stages (five in total), good variety of weapons, and some fun enemies thrown into the mix. Strategizing with friends, just having a good time finding that perfect sniping spot to pick off zombies, aiming for high-point shots (judged by distance, where you shot them, with what weapon, etc.), and then it all crumbling down sometimes as you all get swarmed and have to struggle to survive... It's not super-lengthy, and the ending did disappoint me, but I had a good time with it, and can be a blast with friends."

Well, he would obviously create his Nazi Zombie Army!!!And that's all I can say about the plot as I never really paid too much attention to it. There's no need to. I could also tell you about the gameplay, but actually there's not much to say, the gameplay essentially is the same as in Sniper elite v2 but this time with zombies. Levels are simply tunnels where you have to stop here and there and face the zombie waves.Very quick, very superficial. Because there's no need to go in depth, nor to say too much. Such a simple premise and a recycled gameplay mix just give an amazingly and incredibly fun gameplay, as long as you play cooperatively with friends, of course. This is the kind of game you just play and have fun because you play with friends and it doesn't need any particular story, nor complicated mechanics, just go and shoot or snipe on the hordes, that's all, really. Why the fun? Friends of mine just love wave based coop games... Or zombie games. I can live with it but I've been simply struck by the 80's synth music and that foggy atmosphere that really reminds me of Carpenter's movies. That's my weak point: 80s. Believe me or not that made the difference to me with other common games: the opportunity to play with friends against nazi zombies in foggy villages with an 80's synth music.I could spend a couple of words about the awesomeness of the slowmotion effect during successful sniping shots and the x-ray cam to see which bone has been broken by our bullet, but that's not the news, something already seen and already done, in Sniper Elite v2 or in Mortal Kombat as well.The most important thing I can say is that this is the first chapter, there's a second chapter and there's a trilogy chapter, which holds the first, second and third exclusive episode in an improved engine (not much, just a little bit).So while I recommend this game, I actually recommend you to buy directly the trilogy because this situation doesn't make much sense at all...+++PROs+++ZOMBIES... NAZIS! COOP!!!Facing Hordes of Nazi Zombies with your friends? You've just nailed it, without anything too complicated.ATMOSPHERE.Foggy roads and villages, rubbles in towns everything while you listen to some 80's synth music. Simply perfect!---CONs---MANEUVERABILITY.A common problem with Sniper elite 1 and V2, the caracter's moves can be a bit too rigid sometimes, and it may cost you your life while you're surrounded by zombies.MEANINGLESS EPISODIC PRODUCT.For some odd *cough*MONEY*cough* reason they released the first and the second chapter on their own. Then they released a trilogy with both of them and the final chapter. No discounts for those who already owned the first 2 chapters, no single third chapter as well...

The zombies are not what you expect from nowadays zombies, I mean the running, psycho-like zombies. Well this one is different. As I said earlier, the zombies are slow but also deadly just like in one of George Romero's movies. You can play on solo or with three friends, both are not bad but experiencing with friends are awesome. The gameplay is similar to Sniper Elite V2, the weapons are unfortunately the same but you can choose what you prefer in the safehouse once you've cleared the waves of zombies. I've heard that Zombie Army Trilogy is coming out so I prefer for you to get the trilogy since they got all 2 of the Nazi Zombie games including the new one which is the third.

It's the arcade version of what a hastily-thrown-together version of a Sniper game might look like. There's really no story to speak of and a decent amount of the content isn't even accessible without a co-op partner or three. The game was clearly designed with that squad-based co-op experience in mind. I didn't really know what I was getting into when I bought it, because had I known that I probably would have avoided it in the first place.The worst part is that the gameplay seems to have forgotten the name of the series: the emphasis is not on sniping at all. And there aren't any fun stealth moments either. There are far too many zombies at far too close a range. Instead you're much better off using explosives and automatic weapons if you can find them and just going in loud every time, in every situation.If that's the kind of game you want then I can understand that, but it's not what I wanted from a Sniper game."

However,  the shortage of ammo for close range guns, the slow rate of fire and reload,  means that this is about sitting as far away from the action as you can get and slowly picking the zombies off one by one. If they had changed the balance of the game a little, by including more ammo for the shotgun, and making reloads faster, and they would have brought players in closer to the action and dramatically improved the game.  As it stands, the pace is just too slow. The frequent slow-motion sequences really are unnecessary and really just make the game even slower. Recommended?

First, the good; there's a lot of action, so that's pretty fun. There's some bullet drop for the sniper rifles, right on. The game rewards loot hunters, you'll find guns/ammo all over. The selection of firearms is quite good, something like 20 if I recall correctly. It's interesting being able to set up traps. The slow-mo hits are cool, it's a creepy and stressful game, as well as EXTREMILY difficult sometimes. I won't spoil anything but... that... friggin... church.I think that covers the good, now for the not so good; the MP40 fires too fast, SVT40 fires too slow, STG44 is too weak, M91/30's (Mosin Nagant) front sight is actually a Kar98k front sight, and the M1903's stock looks like a hybrid between a No.4 Lee Enfield and an M1917. From what I can tell, none of the scopes are accurate to real life. I find the special infected can be quite annoying, there is a serious lack of stealth for a sniper game, there is a serious lack of sniping for a sniper game (rarely go beyond 100m. Rarely go beyond 50m for that matter), one of my biggest gripes is there's no FPS option thus no aim down the sights option, and my last issue so far is I've been playing for roughly 2 hours now and it seems to be the same thing over and over:*SPOILERS* Fight a wave that instantly knows where you are. Fight another wave that instantly knows where you are. Fight another wave or two in the same manner. Find a safe house, restock on supplies, maybe change firearms.

And that's the area where this Sniper Elite doesn't work all that well. It works reasonably well in the larger (outside) areas, but when you're fighting in narrow hallways and tunnels it kinda falls flat on its face. Yes, I know, if the whole team is sniping, there's no way you can die, right ? True. But at least make the weapons for these sections enjoyable to use. Most of them are spray and pray and it takes a crazy amount of bullets to put down just one enemy, let alone massive groups during the more intense firefights. The sniping part is enjoyable as always, and the x-ray cam is just awesome, but is shown too frequently at times.The game has a  total of 5 levels. They're all quite big and it's hard to complete any of them on your own. So it's best played with a group of 4 people. It's also the most fun this way.However, the party mechanic could use some work. There are massive amounts of idle hosts, and searching for an existing game practically always leads to you re-entering this very same idle party, which is frustrating and annoying. That, and there are some rage quiters so halfway or near the end of a level someone might leave and if it's the host you'll return back to the main menu, which, well... which sucks !In the end I did have fun with it, but it happened too often that the host left in my last couple of games.

,Recommended,227100,26159995,"Posted: 22 October, 2016",all,The Horror Network | Embalmer,"Review for Sniper Elite - Nazi Zombie Army 2:Here.Rebellion are a company that've brought us some pretty great games over the years such as Alien versus Predator 2000, Rogue Trooper, and the Sniper Elite series; we'll just forget that Rogue Warrior ever happened, that chip also falls on Bethesda's shoulders. For those unaware, the Sniper Elite games are World War II based, hyper-realistic first-person shooter titles that, surprise, revolve around sniping. Played on the right difficulty, the player is tasked with aiming with such precision that a mere slight whisper of wind can put their bullet trajectory off. In 2013, Rebellion decided to cash in on the zombie craze, and in doing so they brought us the first installment of Sniper Elite: Nazi Zombie Army.If there's anything that Wolfenstein has taught the gaming community over the last two decades, it's that killing Nazis in any form is just thoroughly satisfying. Sniper Elite: Nazi Zombie Army has stepped in and managed to make mangling hordes of undead fascists all the more delightful with the series' signature bullet cam, which is triggered randomly upon landing a bullet in an enemy. Seeing Nazi skulls and eye sockets shatter in close up, slo-mo is not only just enjoyable when it's against a ""living"" AI, but it's all the more gruesomely fun when it's against a zombie AI.So what's going on here is that it's the end of World War II, and Hitler is realizing that he's losing the war. Determined to completely destroy the world, he unleashes ""Plan Z"", which as it turns out is the resurrection of all Wehrmacht's fallen soldiers. That's pretty much as far as the story goes in this release, though it is further elaborated on in the Zombie Army Trilogy. Nevertheless, OSS operative and sniper Karl Faireburne, veteran Red Army infantryman Boris Medvedev, Wehrmacht Captain Hermann Wolff, and German occultist Efram Schwaiger are here to save the day. Although if you're playing the single player campaign, you're forced to only play as Karl.The game is spread out across five chapters, each that last about an hour a piece depending on your skill. Every map shows a war-torn Germany in the throes of Nazi warfare. Propaganda litters the walls, Nazi banners are present everywhere. There are also dismembered bodies hanging from street lamps, obvious suicides huddled into corners, blood-drawn pentagrams and swastikas everywhere, and tons of blood and gore splatter all over the place. Most levels also feature fog effects, whether it be low to the ground or encompassing the map. The lighting looks absolutely phenomenal, and it really causes the visuals to pop out and be exceptionally striking. Accompanying the aesthetics is a slightly out of place soundtrack that is reminiscent of the 1980's, and while it doesn't suit the time period of the game, it's a decent listen.Now, Sniper Elite: Nazi Zombie Army is one intense game. It's extremely easy to get overrun by zombies if you don't have patience or take your time; rushing into any part of the map is an incredibly bad idea. You will constantly be questioning yourself, and discovering new tactics to take on the small amount of different enemy types. Should you use your sniper rifle here? What about your pistol there? Should you stick to the beaten path, or do you want to explore to try and find Nazi gold and bottles of blood? Venturing off the trail almost always results in more enemies appearing, do you have enough ammo for that? You're constantly thinking tactically, as ammo conservation is pretty concerning; if you run out, you're dead as weapon and ammo pick ups outside of safe-houses is rare.Your enjoyment of this title will rely very heavily on how good and consistent you are with headshots. Unlike many other zombie shooter games, this one keeps Sniper Elite's signature realism, and in doing so you must aim for the head. If you hit a zombie in the body, it will fall down for a few moments and resurrect, costing you precious ammo to strike it down again. With that said, the enemies can die without headshots, but you will find yourself both starved for ammunition and almost always overrun if that route is taken. Headshots can be very tricky, due to the exaggerated shambling of the foes; their heads are constantly moving, and if you're on stairs you might as well forget about it.As far as mechanics go, pretty much everything from the main Sniper Elite games make an appearance. You can carry three guns with you, one sniper rifle, one shotgun OR automatic weapon, and one pistol. At any time you can also have up to two of each throwable, such as a landmine, dynamite, and grenades. You don't have a health bar, but more than a handful of hits on even the easiest difficulty and you're back to your last checkpoint; which thankfully are placed in generous locations. You can even make your character hold his breath while aiming with a sniper rifle in order to slightly slow down time, though it can only be done if his heart rate is low enough.Much like Left 4 Dead, Sniper Elite: Nazi Zombie Army is truly built for co-op play with up to three other people. Though the game is still a blast during the solo campaign, it doesn't have a big replay factor unless you have some buddies that you can play with. Sadly, online play is dead now, so I can only suggest purchasing this iteration of the game if you want to experience the original solo game; even then I say to consider waiting for at least a 75% discount, especially given the age of the title. There are also a handful of problems that cause the game to feel a little clunky at times; the reach of the enemies is just a little too long for their models, grenades are practically useless due to being unable to control their throw distance, to loot bodies you have to stop and press a key, and the bodies disappear quicker than you can loot them.Despite its very few grievous flaws, Sniper Elite: Nazi Zombie Army is a breathtaking experience. I found myself holding my breath at times, when I was aiming down the scope of my sniper rifle trying to land an important shot. I even uttered the words ""oh no, please, no"" when a bulky, gun-toting Nazi soldier came into play. The game is incredibly immersive, and even though it's tough at the beginning, once you get your headshots down and learn how to deal with each of the five or six enemy types, it becomes a little bit easier. It does take a lot of inspiration from Left 4 Dead, such as safe-houses and siege moments, but it's a much more exhilarating, gore-soaked event. If you have friends to play with, or don't mind a single player experience, grab this one on a 75% discount. Otherwise, look into grabbing Zombie Army Trilogy instead.Rating:4.0/5.0- Excellent, highly worth playing.The Horror NetworkCurator|GroupClick for Gore"

I finally took the plunge after the price went down to 3.49$ and I really regret getting this so late and all my friends are done playing this and now I have no one to play with.The game is similar to left 4 dead series where you move from one point of map to another shooting your way through hordes of zombies. It is basically a big snipping target practice and it can get really tense at time. The use of items like mine and tripwires add a bit more strategy elements compares to L4D.Graphic wise the game is quite nice to look at. The kill can is fun as usual although this time around you only get to see the head shots as body shots don't kill zombies. Maps are atmospheric and sound is excellent and really creepy, although the art assets get recycled a lot and can get repetitive. There are not a big variety of enemies and I would love to see more types of zombies like the special infected in L4D. Music is bad in this game, the techno genre really is out of place in the ww2 setting.Overall I'm pleasantly surprised by this game, it is short and a bit bare in contents, but for 3.49$it's a steal."

(You can increase the number of zombies separately from making them hit harder. My dad and I chose to increase both because. . .zombies are supposed to be in swarms/deadly)- As difficulty increases realism also starts to come into play. Bullet drop and wind starts to become a thing that you have to be aware of.Cons:- If your low on time this is a hard game to manage.

It's quite interesting to have seen a zombie game where most of your kills will be made by sniper rifles.Some time before the game was released, some friends and I speculated that there would be some kind of reference to the zombie modes for either Call of Duty: World at War, Black Ops 1 or Black Ops 2 since that's what we assumed inspired this game. Unfortunately, there wasn't anything that referenced or parodied any of those games in any way. (Except for the disembodied girl's voice that could POSSIBLY been inspired by the character Samantha)Still fun though. It has a campaign that plays like Left 4 Dead because you have to travel to the end of the level to complete it.My only complaint is that the game does not explain how ballistics work, like in Sniper Elite V2. This means that people who have never played SEV2 might play on the highest difficulty without knowing how to use the wind indicator. I haven't seen it myself, but I wouldn't be surprised if there were a few people who said ""why dose da bullet hit the zombie in the shoulder wen i aim for da hed??????????????""Aside from that, it's an alright game."

Anyway, story goes like this: The WW2 is almost over, allies are closing to the Berlin, but Hitler won't surrender that easily (of course). In his last attempt to save Germany he executes plan Z, that awakens the undead. That's the whole story pretty much.The gameplay is based on: killing zombies, surviving the zombie sieges, getting some relic, and getting to the safe room to rearm and start repeating the whole process. There is one boss, but you will battle him twice. There are couple type of the undead:1. zombies- they aren't too dangerous and are quite slow, but can (and probably will) revive if you don't shoot them in the head2. skeletons- quite fast, hitting quickly, they do quite of damage, but have low health3. suicide zombies- they just scream and run towards you with a grenade to blow you up (can be dangerous for whole team)4. gunner- does a LOT of damage with his machine gun and has a lot of healthAnd no, there isn't zombie Hitler.Bullet and xray killcam are here, but since this is rather fast game, when lots of enemies show up, you aren't gonna use your scope too much.

That's all the plot you need to know.Nazi Zombie Armyis a nice blend between the classic Sniper Elite and the zombie horde shooter Left 4 Dead. There's nothing to expect here except lots, lots of zombies. Zombies don't run, but are stronger than L4D. If you're new to Sniper Elite, coming from non-stealth games, this could be a good introduction to the combat and weapon mechanics as you fight at a slightly slower pace than, say, games like L4D, while not putting stealth or cover over everything like the original Sniper Elite.This is what happens in the game: When the hordes attack, your senses will be strained as you try to headshot as many zombies as possible (as it is a guaranteed one hit kill) using your rifle, while occasionally switching to your SMG to wipe enemies that come up close, and kick down those that comewaytoo close before executing them using a pistol, all while your well-placed traps of landmines and tripmines blast off other zombies that try to flank you.When the hordes do not attack, you have all the time in the world (compared to when they do) to align the perfect shot usingfocus time, a time-slowing aim assist that compensates your bullet drop. When things get hectic and frantic, your character (and probably you too) will breath more heavily, heart beat faster, resulting in worse aim that should be compensated by going crouch or prone.Notable, technical shots will reward you with the pleasure of Bullet Cam, a ""killcam"" bullet that shows how your bullet hits and kills your enemy. Was it a two-for-one piercing shot, a shot that goes directly through the pancreas or lungs (or right between the eyes like an overly manly predator?), or just a good old headshot from 200 meters? Bullet Cam will show you exactly what happened.Also available in 4-player mode. Not that I have played it, unfortunately, as I cannot commit enough time to finish a session.The graphics are quite good, but I have only a laptop so I sacrifice textures for framerate. Nevertheless, in NZA gameplay (and kill cams) shine much, much brighter than graphics quality, so you should focus on getting a satisfactory framerate and mouse calibration, as you will aim down the scope a lot.Oh, one final tip before you begin: zombiesshamble, and their heads shake like teenagers in discos.

It was developed by Rebellion and released in 2013. It's a spin-off title of Sniper Elite V2 and one would say that it feels like mod or DLC to it.A thing to note is that when they released Nazi Zombie Army 2 they backported changes from it to the first game. That means that now you have all the grain effects, zombies have yellow shiny eyes and the Preacher weapon got changed. The Preacher always looked like a good old double shotgun, but in original version it actually was some kind of double-rifle, shooting very strong single bullet. Ever since the update it now behaves the way it looks - boomstick.Kinda shame, as I would have prefered if the first game was kept unique compared to sequel.Multiplayer community appears to be quite alive. From what little time I tried it, it would always find one lobby. And after a while it would get filled with few more players. Yes, they can join even when the game is in the process. But I guess that there may be times when there isn't anybody playing.And yes, in this game you go through the linear levels and sometimes get locked into area during siege event. And yep, no plot, pretty much. Aside from Hitler released evil somehow and now you have to escape Berlin over 5 levels. Maybe Fegelein will know how to stop him in a sequel, hmm. And yes, you shoot many zombies. And skeletons.One thing for sure, it has an awesome setting, even if it may get old. It's like a zombie-demons B-Movie old cheesy experience, you can tell that developers weren't taking themselves seriously. Tons of slow slumbering zombies to headshot. Lots of occult and demonic things spread over the levels, with corpses and blood everywhere, giving no care that there is way too much for it to makes sense. Dense colorful fog is covering the ground, it all looks moody and lighting is spread around to give off menacing shadows.And most wonderful of it all is a soundtrack. It's a freaking spooky raving synth combined with piano. Awesome!And yea, gameplay is great for coop. Though you can see that it was based on Sniper Elite v2 engine without much changes. You can still snipe, but instead of having to snipe due to distance, you will do it to accurately hit zombies into head. And due to close quarters, you will use the unscoped aiming of sniper rifle, by holding Left Ctrl button. And yea, headshotting zombies is important, otherwise they take few shots to die and can even revive again if their brains aren't blown. Sometimes it throws special zombies at you, which helps to vary it up. Even though it has a bit too much pure normal zombies encounters.Sadly, there is no randomization, but it's still fun.And yea, due to it being on Sniper Elite V2 it kept some strange things. For example, you can still stick to the cover, which is completely useless in this title. Well, almost, aside from rare case where I got pinned down by zombie snipers. As well as having to scavenge zombies body for ammo which takes few seconds gets really annoying, seeing how many zombies you kill. You just get really bored of it after a while, but then you may run out of ammo. On other hand, explosive traps fit to this game very very much. They are awesome and a well placed and well timed combination of explosive and dynamite can end lifes of dozens dozens zombies.It does however not include any kind of stealth elements. It makes sense, but still will make you wonder about ""Sniper Elite"" part.Sadly, singleplayer feels more of throw so people will not moan about lack of it. They don't even have achievements for beating any chapter in single anyway. There are no bots in this game and being solo isn't exciting. All the filler encounter with only normal zombies get very monotonous, since there is only you on battlefield. Heck, I even felt that difficulty and pacing was uneven. The first level's siege were actually the hardest and most fun ones in the game. Or it's the way it felt from beating campaign once. And heck, killcams that were praised in Sniper Elite V2 get annoying here in no end.So yes, fun little spin-off but only in cooperative mode and it gets monotonous after a while. However, you should get Zombie Army Trilogy which includes campaign of this game.P.S. It has different balance from ZAT. In ZAT kicks are much stronger, non-rifles are weaker, skeletons die from one kick."

,Recommended,227100,9334639,"Posted: 3 March, 2014",all,Tears of Blood,"You'll notice a bad Metascore for this game. Don't always trust the Metascore. You know exactly what you are getting when you read the title of this game. You're going to be using a sniper rifle (primarily) to murder the living daylights out of nazi zombies. Now, I can understand if you just read that sentence and you said to yourself ""That sounds idiotic."" This game isn't for you, then. If you read that sentence, though, and you say to yourself ""That sounds fun as hell!"", then I can almost guarantee this game is worth your money, especially for how cheap it is.Let me get into the nitty-gritty here. The visuals for this game are superb. Some of the graphical options even kill my framerate, like supersampling. Not only are the textures fairly impressive, whether it be the evironment or the character models (i.e. the zombies), but the effects are pretty superb as well. In addition to that, the color scheme all-together visual style of the game is just amazing. You can look through my screenshots to see what I mean.The gamplay is exactly what you would expect, with an interesting flourish that relates back to the visuals. When you shoot a zombie with your sniper rifle, you have a certain likelihood that it will do an x-ray style kill-cam. Let me just say, that while it might get old after a while, it is very impressive to see. There are so many little details that you may not even notice at first. The bones will shatter in certain patters, lungs will deflate, eyes will pop out of sockets, blood will splatter and trail in the path the bullet takes after exiting, which will also twirl around, mangled and dented from impact. Did I mention the exploding heart, kidneys, and testicals? Now, I realize that's pretty violent, and obviously if this kind of thing makes you squeamish, but you still want to play, then you have the option to disable the kill-cam altogether. There are also some boss fights that are really fun as well. I'd say if this game had a weakness in the gameplay department, it would probably be that sometimes there are just -too many- zombies. They definitely go a little overboard, and some stages can drag, when you wish they would just end. I imagine most people will take breaks playing the game between stages because it really does fatigue you a bit.The music is pretty good, but not particularly memorable. Not much to say there. The zombies actually sound pretty scary when they are chanting or screaming or what have you. Probably the most appealing part of the sound design are the guns. They sound good, they sound powerful, just as they should.Now, where this game falls short...? The story. Were you expecting a story? You shouldn't be. I realize that we can get snobbish and start demanding good stories from everything under the sun these days, but really, I don't think it's necessary for every game that comes out. It has a plot, it's pretty weak, but it's not abhorrent considering the kind of game it is.Altogether, I really enjoy this game. It's great. I'll give it a solid 7/10. For me, that's a recommendation with an asterisk. Like I said, if you read the sentece from the beginning of this review, then you know exactly what you're getting, and if that's what you're looking for, then you're going to be pleased. If not, well then better to skip this and move on to something else."

If you like  killing hordes of zombies in the entourage of WWII - buy it.And now in more detail. I bought NZA when it was on sale, just didn't hear about it before, but have played Sniper Elite 2 though and liked it. Now I want you to get one important thing: I didn't read any reviews whatsoever, because if I did, I probably wouldn't have bought it. In my opinion, the scores I've seen for this game on the web - from 40s to 60s, are extremely low and I just don't know why. The game IS fun to play, both single or with friends. While it doesn't offer almost any story, the atmosphere in the game is just how it should be. It's heavy and you feel it. Sometimes it gets scary and very oppressing in SP and that is just what I was looking for, because it didn't feel this way in L4D. And in the multiplayer it gets really intense, because the number of zombies is multiplied to the number of players.If you can't decide whether you need to buy it or not - just watch some gameplay videos. Good luck and have fun!"

There's a decent range of scoped rifles, pistols, automatics and shotguns (The Preacher is amazing). The campaigns are challenging and the range of zombies is also good. The setup of the game is a little bit like L4D where you start at one point and have to make your way through hordes of zombies to the next safe room, stock up on amoo etc then keep going, but everything else is so different.

,Recommended,227100,7903444,"Posted: 3 December, 2013",all,Junaii,"This is an overlooked gem.I picked this up in a steam sale with no prior knowledge and I have to say it really impressed me. Firstly, I know this game was made for a relatively modest budget but the production values are up there with AAA titles. Graphics are very well done, animations, lighting and textures are impressive & it runs silky smooth. Its very solid with no noticable bugs and its obvious a lot of craft and care has gone into making this game as fun as possible.The premise is that its a (up to) four player, coop 3rd person shooter. As the title suggests the main antagonists are Nazi Zombies. The obvious comparisons to make are to Call of Duty: Black Ops coop nazi zombie mode and Left for Dead.While it borrows elements from each it does very much have its own ideas and its own character but if I was summarising it to a friend I would say its COD's zombies in Left for Dead style open levels.Levels are well designed and although quite linear they do give options for paths to take and for cover and at key points require teamwork and strategy from the coop players with enemies coming in multiple directions. The main weapon of choice is the sniper rifle and this adds an interesting game mechanic. Getting a headshot is immensly satisfying but when enemies start getting in close you can switch to a closer range weapon but ammo for these guns is in short supply. It really makes you think about each shot and makes things very tense when your in danger of getting overwhelmed.Sniper Elites party piece is there and is a gory and fun idea in a similar vein to Mortal Kombat's fatalities. When you get a certain kind of shot you get treated to a slow motion, xray view of the bullet passing through the body, causing horrendous damage to internal organs and bones. Even after a lot of play it can still be very satisfying to watch after a good shot.If you and some friends have played Left for Dead to death and want something new and a bit different and a hell of a lot of zombie blasting fun I recommend giving this a go. Im looking forward to grabbing to sequel soon as well"

The mood really drives the point home that zombies are horrible, abominations of hell, and becoming one is a fate worse than death itself. I've actually felt sad for the folks that ended up as zombies, and the fact that I was one of the few, last living souls in the entirety of WW2 Germany.Sure, the first chapter feels dull and generic, with the lack of a proper introduction or backstory and a visibly linear design, but the game picks up on the second chapter and gets better on all aspects all the way to the end. The x-ray camera for headshots and vitals make it extremely satisfying to shoot through a horde of zombies. Causing exposed fractures and spraying brain matter all over the place has never been this satisfying.The end was a bit disappointing, feels like a sequel hook, but not nearly enough to offset all the fun I had during the game. I can see this being awesome in multiplayer.As Eurogamer Spain puts it: ""This spin-off removes all the filling to keep only what's important: the sniper rifle, the x-ray camera and lots of stupid enemies.""Recommend."

,Recommended,227100,8335584,"Posted: 27 December, 2013",all,Madame Écureuil,"When one thinks of zombie shooters, the kind of combat that usually comes to mind are close-quarters and brutal in nature which encourages twitch reactions and allows for some poor aiming. However, this game tried something new by taking the idea of methodical and deliberate long range combat prevalent in the Sniper Elite series with the legion of inexorable shambling Nazis.And the most amazing thing is, it actually works. The way that the weapons are balanced allows for a wide gamut of sniper rifles that are great for different situations, as well as a great selection of secondary weapons for when things get too intimate. From the PPSh-41 and it's extreme RoF, to the stopping power of the Trench gun, there is always a gun for every situation, and the challenge is executing your shots right.Being that this is a budget title made by Rebellion, I didn't expect this to be good and bought it for ironic entertainment value. Instead, I got genuinely entertained by the variety of weapons, and the zombies' reactions to being shot. Of course there are a LOT of rough edges to this game, like how hit detection for headshots can be spotty at times, or how the bullet vision can be annoying with how often it triggers.Do I recommend this game? Absolutely! Especially if you're looking for an alternative to Left 4 Dead 2, it is a blast on co-op."

The main difficulty is knowing how to manage the waves of enemies in little spaces and with few ammo. Good locations and enjoyable soundtrack.Piccola premessa: è uno spinoff della serie principale, quindi va comprato solo per puro divertimento, non aspettatevi chissà che cosa. Mantiene lo stile di Sniper Elite anche se la trama non è tra le più originali, sono per gli amanti della saga quindi. Campagna abbastanza breve e con poche varietà di nemici, ma presenti spesso in orde che vi terranno impegnati.

A lot.Definitely would recommend you to buy it although it would be nice to get the game with at least 10~25% off.It's a pretty simple and straight foward game, you just need to go from point A to point B and kill the zombies along the way.There are some little twists here and there, like when you'll need to hold your position and kill hordes of zombies trying to siege your position or some boss battles.Even though all the levels are pretty much linear I really enjoyed how they were crafted specially for the use of sniper rifles. There are lots of open spaces, long corridors and high places where you'll find yourself being able to effectively shoot zombies in the head all the time.By the way killing zombies, the central point of the game, feels nice. You may get sick of it if you play the game for more than 3~4 hours straight, though. But overall killing zombies in this game is really satisfying.It took me about 10 hours to finish the game on normal difficulty on single player mode. The game has a lot of replayability and also a focus on co-op with 3 other players but unfortunately I don't have any friends so I can't say much about the co-op.I'll definitely play through it again in the future.Summing up: In spite of the game feeling incomplete, it is a great game with a lot of replayability. It may get monotonous after a while but I definitely recommend it, mainly if you enjoy sniper rifles or games like Left 4 Dead and killing floor.If possible, buy it when it's in sale."
,Not Recommended,227100,7712472,"Posted: 21 November, 2013",all,MrJenssen,"Sniper Elite: Nazi Zombie Army can be an enjoyable game. But it comes with a long list of pretences. First of all, you NEED to have friends who are willing to play this with you. Preferably friends who are fans of Army of Darkness and similar campy zombie movies. Second, you need to know what you're getting into. NZA isn't a smart game, nor is it an original game. It isn't all that much of a good game either. It's just a little something you and your friends can jump into together for a few hours on a boring, rainy Sunday afternoon. For the cheap price you pay, Nazi Zombie Army is not at all a bad purchase in its own right. It is its own, stand-alone game for the price of a Call of Duty map pack. It looks good, has about the same length as Medal of Honor, and it has four-player Co-Op. The problem is just that, in this day and age, when you can get a retail game for the same price during a Steam daily deal, NZA simply does not hold a candle to the competitors. The game isn't great, some will argue that it isn't even good. I had fun with it, but I purchased it knowing what I was getting into. If you're desperate for more Co-operative zombie action, then you might want to try it out. But if you're new to the genre, you might as well pick up Left 4 Dead 2 instead.3/5Read more:http://pixeljudge.com/en/reviews/sniper-elite-nazi-zombie-army/"

The price was right as well at only 14.99 though I bought it half price during a steam sale, I could have paid 30 for it and it still would have been worth it, its loaded with tons of ghoulish zombies and you have a well stocked arsenal of weapons to choose from while dealing death back to the undead. But what seperates this zombie shooter from all the rest is the trademark bullet cam feature you get from the developers of Sniper Elite, you literally watch your bullet find its way to the chosen target and watch as it explodes through the zombies skulls and other vital bodily parts, wicked fun! Whether your a fan of sniper elite, zombies or both you will enjoy this, I know I do. Highly recommended."

More numerous than it's sequel but with a little less threat due to the map design I feel, it can still be quite overwhelming at times. Sadly as purely a campaign it can get repetitive and lacks that long term replayability (as do most similar games).What it really excels at is co-op play, and was clearly designed to be played on max difficulty with max players. Potentially a bit easier due to the ability to revive each other, don't let your guard down as you can quickly get overwhelmed by seemingly endless hordes. Sniper rifles versus slow moving targets may sound easy but they do a very good job of shuffling and swaying out of the way, providing some frustration at times.In single player the music combined with the blood-soaked, corpse ridden environment can get a bit creepy at times, but co-op turns it from more horror to action."

But I can't.Sniper Elite: Nazi Zombie Army sounds great when you say it out loud. It looks great written or typed.While Nazi Zombie Army sounds like a great idea to improve an already great game, it completely fails here. SE:NZA should be a great game, but sadly, it isn't.Everything that made Sniper Elite fun - is missing. There's no setup, no planning, no eliminating the odd patrolling enemy to get closer to your target, no setting up traps. Its just a 3rd person corridor shooter with a Sniper rifle, 10 mags of ammo, a SMG and 2 spare magazines, and your handgun and a dozen spare mags.I didn't get to do any real sniping apart from blowing away the odd half dozen Nazi Zombies while moving from horde fight to horde fight. And in those horder fights, I just used partial zoom to blow them away, used the SMG or Shotgun when they got too close, or rounded them into a circle and lobbed a grenade at them.For a series that revolves around sniping and stealth for its main selling points, NZA doesn't even bother trying to include them into its gameplay. Whats even worse is that I had more fun playing the various Call of Duty zombie survial modes.Going to leave this brain dead game to rot in a dark corner of my library, and go back to the true Sniper Elite roots."

The other parts are just nuances Ill get into in a moment.So you are back in Berlin and it's a Zombie Army you are fighting. There are 5 maps to go through and I can say, this is a pretty EVIL game. Single player is pretty good and you can have up to 4 players in Multiplayer. Unfortunately when you play single player, you are alone. Unlike Left 4 Dead where you have 3 other AI's with you. This would have proved interesting for harder levels. But that's not the case. So that is one of my quirks. Once you get use to the gameplay, it's pretty straight forward. Zombies come at you and no use using stealth for the most parts. It's not going to work. They just come right for you. So keep your hearbeat down for any quick sprints you may need.The graphics are amazing! You are welcomed into the game with one of the most beautiful creeps scenes ever put on a game. Foggy everywhere and it's NIGHT time for this whole game. So I as usual, bought this on a discount and worth the $5. But one can easily be bored with single player, so let's head to multiplayer.Multiplayer is GREAT! Harder levels are easier with other live players. I breezed though the elite levels pretty fast. You have the options if you start a server on how many enemies you want 1-4x per person. That means 4 enemies per person if you choose 4x. But this can prove fatal becasue it seems servers are not really reliable and people lose the connection. They do eventually come back in, but sometimes the damage is done. AND I do see issues with delay. I find myself losing bullets fast when I shoot a good shot, but it doesn't register. Again, a few small issues.The music in the game is incredible. Sort of a 80's sound to it a little bit, but it is suiting to the game. Have a listen if you can.Hope you enjoy the gameUPDATE on multiplayer and lag.Well I believe it depends where you are player and where the server is. I have noticed that if I create the server, my lag is gone basically, and even other players don't have a problem."

You team up with 3 people and you start shooting Nazi zombie soldiers throughout the 5 chapters the game offers. As opposed to ""regular"" zombie games this one explains zombies by the good-old occultism background that gives the game a more creepy atmosphere: zombies have glowing eyes and the demonic laughter they occasionally produce can give everybody the creeps.Eliminating these otherworldly creatures with precision aiming is very exciting - wind is not taken into account as was in the original Sniper Elite games; this is as casual as it can get. Also, I liked how the developers tried to make this game authentic - objects and places feel realistic and you can really feel being part of an apocalyptic WW II era.And here comes the bad part: Finding players online is extremely difficult. I read many forums and I know there is a relatively big community and really wants to keep playing this game. I also had the chance of playing with 3 people several times only to find myself disconnected once a chapter ended. Some of these were friends on Steam and while chatting with them they confirmed having being disconnected. Playing the game alone is simply too difficult and boring - also, some achievements can only be attained in cooperative gameplay.If you want to play this game badly I suggest not only to wait for a big discount but also to gather at least 3 friends who want to desperately play it. With the 4 of you playing it together you can manage to have fun throughout but even with friends you'll experience disconnection several times.In addition to this the game also has a handful of bugs and glitches. I find it difficult to recommend a game that is marred by so many issues."

The second game is passable since it is literally the exact same game as this just a few new maps and a couple new enemies, so only get it on sale cheap if you couldn't get enough of this one.If you want the third game forget about it. They decided to not sell it seperately, only in the ""Zombie Army Trilogy"" for $50 and from what I hear it is the exact same game as the first two so it's basically the biggest ripoff on steam and imo one of the dumbest marketing schemes I've ever heard of. It was just on sale in the 2016 winter sale for $8 and that is the only time it is worth getting to get all 3 games for cheap, only if you don't have any of them already. If it's over $8 don't bother because you can frequently find the first two games on sale for $3.75 each and the third game offers nothing new. It's also hilarious how they suddenly got scared to use the word Nazi anymore and went P.C. with their new game title."

,Not Recommended,227100,9671061,"Posted: 29 March, 2014",all,Night Mode,"(Remember this my opinion) Ahhh... This game really is something. But before I start I know I haven't put alot of time into this so this is a first impressions and they are not very good. First it is the most repetitive games I have ever played. Let me explain the concept of this game. You run to area then ""Survive the Seige"" or ""Clear the area"" then run to a safe house get ammo, then you just rinse and repeat. Second the game has some extremaly weird framerate issues. I randomly loose 30 frames for no reason and I get around 15 frames when I aim at the ground. Yet I get solid 60 frames when looking at an extremaly large hoard of zombies. Third the graphics, more importantly the fog. Some areas you can't even see anything because of how much fog there is. Also to me, it seems to have some weird film grain affect making it look like crap. Fourth even though this doesn't ruin the game, I feel like in a game called Sniper Elite you would think a sniper would be useful and affective but it's not, at least for me. I find it so much easier to use the automatic weapons instead. Now I do give them some props for trying to put in things to mix it up a bit like zombies with guns and skeletons that have to be shot in the heart to kill them but it doesn't do much. I actually find fighting the regular zombies more enjoyable because the others are extremaly annoying to fight in my opinion. Something I did enjoy was just lobbing grenades and blowing up a crowd of zombies, but the character seems to like to chuck them as hard as he can and the grenades end up behind the zombies... Any way these are my first impressions of the game. Thanks for reading! (Remember this is my opinion)."

I was looking forward to tossing rocks to distract zombies, find creative routes through levels, and revel in the patient gameplay that makes Sniper Elite so cathartic. Instead, I'm treated to a corridoor shooter with no real reason to even include sniper rifles.  Gone are the stealth mechanics, instead you move to a checkpoint that spawns zombies who know where you are, even if they can't see you.  Even the distraction methods from the regular game have simply been cut out. If it were a free DLC, I'd say it was worth it, but it isn't."

However, they don't get much in the way here, since cover is rarely a thing you have to worry about (though there are some zombie snipers and gunner zombies; not many).-The game berating me for inevitably failing to put each of my bullets in the head of a zombie is amusing. ""Like a drunk who lost a bet!"" It's also nice to shoot a zombie's potato grenade and kill him and his nine best friends, even if that is almost always an accidental hit.-Don't play single player. It's completely boring and as soon as you start fighting skeletons (very early on) it is basically impossible. Four-player coop is more fun, and does require a little bit of teamwork. For the most part the game is a shooting gallery, but it does scratch an itch.-I see what people mean by the killcam being the highlight of this series.

Others may say the special infected such as snipers or gunners are the game's downfall, but I think it makes it more challenging, thus better. If you try to run inscreaming yolo, you will be torn to shreds. If you stand back and pick off the zombies one by one, you will burn through more ammo, yes, but you will be able to waltz right through the next checkpoint after. Ressurecting zombies are annoying, but they can be prevented from a headshot (even before they ressurect). Although the maps were taken right from the campaign, Rebellion reimagined them with the look of an apocalypse. The weapons provided are very balanced, so no player will have a huge advantage over another.

I liked V2 and NZA is based squarely on that, meaning it's the same engine and some same sets. It looks different even when the sets are the same.A hundred rounds plus ammo stocks and loads of creepy enemies - nice! They have given the zombies a great sinister and evil characteristic.There is little to learn. You just jump in without any need to look at a manual, and it's only a little slow at the very start. You get better as you play, and it gets better as it goes along.Having a blast now. You soon get back into the swing of judging distance and bullet drop so headshots start to flow. Slow-mo take-downs for vital hits. Never get bored of that.(Paid £2.50 and put down about 2150 zombies so far.)EDIT: It's about eight hours play time.

Sniper Elite: Nazi Zombie Army is what Sniper Elite V2 should have been. It’s just so much better killing hordes of zombies instead of a few sparse groups of Nazis. The same weapons are present (+ a few new ones I think), and the same equipment is available. Gameplay is identical to Sniper Elite V2 which fits in nicely to the survival genre. The enemies are more varied, some are suicidal, some are over-sized, some are extremely fast. There’s a good diversity to fight, and plenty of weapons to use (mostly rifles of course). The rifles don’t differ that much, some hit harder, some fire faster, but all of them kill zombies effectively. The bullet cam returns with it’s amazing x-ray kill shot  mode, this time with a decaying zombie corpse!There’s a single player campaign which is fun to play, but the co-op campaign is where you get your real money’s worth. Enemy density is determined by how many players are in the match, so 2 players means a challenge, and 4 players means prepare for a massacre :P It really is fun to battle the zombie apocalypse alongside friends. The levels are linear, but quite large to allow different options and vantage points for all players. With only 5 missions, the campaign won’t last long, but Sniper Elite difficulty will have you coming back if you’re thirsty for a challenge.A great standalone game that was worth the pre-order, and something that I‘ll be playing with friends until that ♥♥♥♥♥y elite difficulty has been beaten."

First off ive been playing this game for about 7 years now and every playthrough ive had of it was exellent. There is alot of variety when it comes to builds. There is the obvious Light/Dark or Grey option for the game but there is also Force user builds, Ranged builds, Pure combat focused guardian, etc. I find the combat to be enjoyable (In my opinion) since its tactical and you can really plan attacks and things of that sort. Take DA:0 for example. Its pretty much the same system. You can start with 3 beginning classes: Guardian (Combat focused), Sentinel (Better skill progression), and Consular (Force powers). You then later in the game get different set of prestige classes depending on your allignment. Now, lets get to the writing of the game. This game has one of the best stories I have ever seen. You'll see once you play it for yourself. The reason I prefer this game slightly over the first is just because I prefer the darker, philosophical, grey aspects of the atmosphere and story a bit better (Kotor 1 is also one of my favorite games). Anyways, this game presents the idea that Dark is not necessarily evil and Light isnt nessesary good and you really get to see the Flaws of both sides. For example, you play as the Jedi Exile, who was exiled from the Jedi order for rusing to war to protect innocents. The Jedi were lazy and waited to ""evaluate the threat"". The dialouge and voice acting in this game is absolutely fantastic (Especially Kreia). For this game, you dont even need to be a fan of Star Wars. A non Star Wars fan would look at this game and just play an RPG. However a Star Wars fan would look at this and play an amazing Star Wars RPG. The reason for this is because the game is set in an era wayyy before the Movies. One flaw however, would be the cut content presented this game. Obsidian (The developers) were rushed to release this game by lucasarts, resulting in them needing to cut out content for the game. Luckily, a group of community modders managed to get into the games files and restore alot of the content that was cut. You can find the mod on the steam workshop. Anyways, hurry up and buy the game! You wont be dissapointed."

The only changes I would like to see would be able to create barricades in doorways, like Killing Floor, maybe some character options or talents.Call of Duty wishes they could make a zombie mode as fantastic as this. I just wish the multiplayer community was more active, took me a little while to get a match-maker system, can see this being a ball when playing on Skype with mates on this one."

,Recommended,227100,9863465,"Posted: 18 April, 2014",all,The Ancient Wizard,"Since Sniper Elite: Nazi Zombie Army and its sequel are essentially the same game I feel that one review is necessary.The concept of Nazi Zombies isn’t anything new. However to have a campaign based completely around a zombified Deutschland did arouse my curiosity. To say I was astonished is a bit much, and to say I was disgruntled isn’t necessary either. There are pros and cons to this game.The Good.The series features a foggy, bloodied Germany. Something that really isn’t new in any zombie-based video game. However the rules of double tap, beware of bathrooms and the buddy system are all legible in this game. After striking down a kill if it wasn’t a headshot, it’ll probably resurrect. Beware of anywhere really; zombies either dig themselves out of the ground or were sleeping where they died in their previous life. The buddy system is the most important during cooperative play. Due to the explosive zombies or the rifle wielding ones you will get downed a lot. Something that most zombie games don’t have is slow lumbering zombies and that is what this game has. I appreciate the classic zombie speed, giving there is large quantities of zombies to balance it. Oh and the x-ray vision of a zombie’s skull being pierced is the most thrilling thing ever!The Bad.The series is a mixture of Left 4 Dead and Call of Duty’s Nazi Zombies. First thing first is Survive the Siege, where a large group of zombies know where you are at. Which isn’t bad, but when your game is 50% siege survival it does get a little dull. The next thing is Get to the Safehouse which for some reason every safehouse in every zombie game is stockpiled with weapons, ammo, enough trip mines to destroy the fatherland then how is it there are only four survivors?How do these guys even know where the safehouse is? I know there is two playable german characters but in all the destruction you can recognize where the safe houses are? Another problem is the other generic thing: Zombie Subclasses, can someone tell me why there are zombies that know how to use guns and others that don’t? What about the annoying “Kamikaze” zombies? At least zombies with guns lumber these zombies just sprint at you full force and usually a single bullet doesn’t stop them. The thing that makes me laugh is the demon circles summoning the Spooky Scary Skeletons. The final thing that is bland is the boss battles. Why is every boss battle a Nazi ghost that summons nazi zombies? Sure the one at the cathedral was okay. But why is there more than that? Surely you could have incorporated Zombie Hitler instead of just killing him off.The Ugly.Game has more graphic bugs than anything. When turning on Cinema grain effect some zombies have glowing heads. Random textures and bump mapping data screw up as soon as you mess with the graphics in-game. Then there is the broken servers where you just cleared the siege and the next mission starts except for the fact the invisible walls didn’t disappear and everyone is waiting for the mission that never comes. But my biggest pet peeve is broken collision meshes. I strike a zombie twice in the head both bullets failed to make contact. Sometimes the clipping floor panels trap you until Mr.Full-Metal-Jack shoots you dead. Another pet peeve is why do some bullet pierce the body but make no wounds?OVERALL--Graphics : 6/10Gameplay : 8/10Story : 3/10Multiplayer : 5/10Final Outlook: Game that is action-packed with everyone’s zombie killing needs, if you want a fun game with little to no storyline this is perfect for you."

If you really like the Sniper Elite series, it is a decent addition, but there are some significant issues.I have played with both a mouse and KB, as well as an Xbox controller, and I find the controlls when aiming to be top notch, but while moving....Ok, so the guy runs, but if I am not facing an item directly, he will not pick it up. If I am not facing it correctly, it won't bring up the interaction button for opening doors or searching enemies.  Again, if you are not DIRECTLY facing the specific part of a wall that allows a vault, he will not vault.  THIS IS CRUCIAL!!!Why is this so annoying do you ask?  Let me digress a bit...In past Sniper games, there is much SNEAKING and PLANNING.In THIS Sniper game, there is much running, and alot less planning.  The zombies come at you in hoards, often with the section you are in being blockaded so you are limited on where you can front an attack.  This does not work well with zombies that do not try to hide, they just keep following you.So while you are busy trying to find a good spot to shoot from, you are constantly having to pop a couple and GO!  You cannot stand still for long.I was expecting more room for strategy, and so far the game is kind of boring me.  Not too much story yet, and like I said, strategy is not really given time to happen.If you enjoy the bullet time of Sniper Elite, it is fun to watch zombies get ripped apart.But if you like the sneaking and SNIPER feel to the gameplay, do not expect it so much here.Pick it up on sale, but remember that it is gonna feel like an arcade game, rather than a good Sniper experience."

,Recommended,227100,10260410,"Posted: 27 May, 2014",all,Wizard of Jazz,"An excellent game. Granted, this is the first SE game I've played, but I thought that this game was fantastic, and was a lot of fun. To me, SE:NZA is structured similar to the Left 4 Dead series, with long campaign ""missions"" with safe house checkpoints inbetween.However, this game stands proudly as a unique and fun experience. I personally had a lot of fun while playing SE:NZA, and regardless of whether players want to be marksmen and take high-distance, high-risk shots, or instead run into hordes guns blazing with submachine guns and grenades, there is something for everyone. The game is fine in single player, but is best in multiplayer.Another HUGE bonus: this is one of the few zombie games (yes, UNIQUE Nazi Zombies!) that has OCCULT-based zombies. It's been a while since I've seen non-infected, non-chemically-alterted zombies. The Occult themes allow for NZA to be a fun, yet creepy experience that's good to play with friends.Some downsides however:- The game has a tendency to play at Low Priority. I don't understand why this is, but those with high-end computers might find the game chugging more than usual. It resets as soon as you start playing again. I still don't know how to fix this.- Enemies can get stuck on stairwells, and very rarely enemies will not spawn, forcing you to restart the level.- There are many achievements requiring one to play co-op. While I'm not opposed to co-op achievements, getting 2000 kills in co-op is useless, as you can simply set up a private, 1-player co-op lobby and get the achievement there.All and all, a good experience.

,Recommended,227100,4726862,"Posted: 19 March, 2013",all,Skullkan6,"Look, you may have heard bad things about this game zbut frankly, this is a game i'd call not that bad. Like with Dead Island, how you view it depends on how much you like zombies. As a game for those who enjoy zombies in survival horror, it's an 75-85/100, for everyone else lower that score about 15-25 points (and 60 is average). First of all it's a linear campaign designed for Co-op that's also playable in Singleplayer if you like choosing the lesser way to play the game. (This is NOT as the case was with Dead Island where both were enjoyable and challenging, the game is legitimately made for Co-op and not much more.) There is yet to be a survival mode nor has one been promised but don't let that disuade you, as the campaign offered is much better than you may expect.Now if I have to say this game's greatest strength out-loud other than the kill-cam, it's how it handles hordes and this game is somehow able to handle hordes of slow zombies better than any game i've ever seen, and yes that includes Left 4 Dead where zombies were basically lightly wet sponges in comparison. This is admittedly something that has to be seen in action or played, and at that in co-op as singleplayer scales the zombie count down considerably. I myself haven't run into too many bugs nor any game crippling ones other than the innability to adjust player voice chat volume in the options menu. I can't put it any better than this: If you are find paying $20 for an Okay game and love zombies to death (and hopefully have friends who feel the same) this probably a pretty good purchase for you. It's legitimately tense during many moments and as I said before handles hordes better than any zombie game i've ever seen. And just to set the record straight, they did actually appear to put a bit of effort into this."

Well, Sniper Elite is a series that has good gunplay and Nazi Zombie Army follows suit, along with a very fun coop experience to boot!The gameplay is like if you combined Left 4 Dead and The Mercenaries from Resident Evil 4. Like the Mercenaries, there's the peons that go down in one headshot, then there's the heavy dude that won't stop or go down without a lot of punishment. There's a fair amount of weaponry to choose from, allowing you to divert from sniping entirely. The levels progress in very similar fashion, to Left 4 Dead, safehouses and all.

It retains the beautiful sniping mechanics of sniper elite with aim adjustment for wind and velocity/distance, you get a satisfying go at popping thousands of zombie heads in gory slow motion (something that you can toggle off in case it ends up boring you after the 4600th kill).That isn't all you'll be doing, though. Featuring iconic WW2 weaponry with their own benefits and drawbacks, you have plenty of choice when it comes to dealing with the hellish hordes that the führer has summoned. Not everyone is an expert sniper and you can still have a grand old time mowing down the flesheating freaks with a machine gun.Set at the end of WW2, the nazi war machine is failing and Hitler pursues a desperate method of salvaging his war. An ancient nepalese relic recovered by the Thule society reanimates the slain wehrmacht to devour the enemies of the Reich! It's up to our hero, Karl Fairburne, the great Russian bear of a man Boris Medvedev, Dr. Schweiger and redeemed(?) nazi Herman Wolff to wipe the undead scourge off the streets of Berlin before it spreads to the rest of the continent!That's it for the plot, really. It's vaugely elaborated upon in the followup Nazi Zombie Army 2 but not by much. If you expect a plot, play something different but it's good for what it is, playing up the nazi occult thing in a way I've only seen the Wolfenstein games explore.Mechanics wise, it's a third person shooter in which you counter hordes of sluggish zombies (no running here, except for the suicide bombers!) but it's not that easy. Unlike games like left 4 dead, you go down in just a couple of hits and the numbers that spawn in co-op can seem endless at times. But hey, that's what grenades are for!Single player and multiplayer are pretty much the same deal but with more players come more of a challenge. More enemies will spawn to hinder you and something you thought was a breeze when playing alone can become a nightmare.The levels themselves are largely remade levels from the sniper elite game, approached from different angles and merged in interesting ways. You'll kind of know your way if you played the main game.Enemy variety includes regular zombies who are just your typical flesh eating monster, groaning and shuffling about as well as quicker moving stripped skeletons who are very good at overwhelming their opposition, forcing stationary snipers to move about.The previously mentioned suicide bombers appear in the middle of regular zombie hordes to catch you off guard and rush you and sometimes you're faced with eerily cackling zombie snipers, leaping from building to building to take shots at you while you're trying to handle the horde in front.There's also the trooper zombies who are gigantic, slow moving behemoths with machine guns, shooting right back at you and demanding dozens of shots to the forehead to finally drop.Finally, there's the occult general. A very rare, scripted boss creature that summons hordes of every variety and protects himself with a magical barrier of floating skulls, encouraging a different kind of headshot.That's enough about that. Gameplay wise, it's good for what it is. Hardly a captivating masterpiece of storytelling to share with your grandkids someday but an entertaining go through a strange, strange setting.I don't believe in scores so I rate this game as fun, entertaining but capable of being a lot more than what we're given. Maybe we'll see the formula brought to perfection in sniper elite Afrika's version of the zombie nightmare?"

Ammo can be scarce if you waste it and don't search corpses. With it being snipers,every shot counts. I played by my self which was pretty difficult. The way I play the game is a more run and shoot. No. This game, you got a horde coming towards you, you better make every shot count. If you don't then they get really cuddlely, and gang bang you. This game is fun. Play it at night alone with a headset on full blast, and you'll be scared. Oh and if you think your friends will help you and make it easy, think again because you can change how many zombies spawn for the map. Meaning that you can have a whole lot of zombies for one person or just enough to make it complicated for 2 or more."

,Not Recommended,227100,11327974,"Posted: 19 July, 2014",all,The Archbishop of Banterbury,"My opinion has changed. While I find this game to be fun, it gets old very quickly. Nazi Zombies have been done to death at this point, the objectives are all the same and some missions are almost damn impossible on single player. It might be better with friends but I haven't played co-op so I wouldn't know. Hardly any sniping as you're always getting attack by hordes of Zombies. You can snipe a few but I always end up pulling out my machine gun and mowing them done that way instead. The graphics are the same as V2, aside fro everything being a lot darker. Boss fights are okay but again get old fast because the boss you're fighting decides to spawn a horde on you. Not much variety when it comes to enemies. You have standard Zombies, running kamikaze grenade zombies, big zombies with machine guns and jumping sniper zombies. You get all the guns from V2 straight away (except for some reason they're missing a few it seems) but special weapons can be found out in the feild, but with very little ammo for them. This is one of those times where I wish Steam had a meh button. If you're looking for a zombie shooter, buy Left 4 Dead or L4D2. Its coop and actually very fun. If you're looking for a good sniper game get V2. It is also coop (with 2 players) and very fun. If you just want a brainless (hah) shooter that is good for wasting time with get this I guess. But don't get Nazi Zombie Army 2. Its basically the same game but with different enviroments. JUST LIKE CALL OF DUTY LOLOLOLBut seriously don't bother."

,Recommended,227100,103619,"Posted: 9 March, 2013",all,Alienami,"So far its a lot of fun, bit challenging until you get the teamwork going on scripted wave events and bosses. Great graphics and atmosphere and sounds. Takes time to get used to the ballistics of the rifles and how to time for the zombies odd movements as they shamble or run at you, or wander aimlessly in the distance. 4 Player Co-Op is where its at for this game, anything less is doing it wrong for Co-Op; the Church boss will be all but impossible to defeat for a 2 man team, according 2 friends who tried repeatedly.My loadout of choice: M1 Carbine, Thompson, the russian pistol(?)The M1 has 15 round mags loaded with .30 Cal, all the stopping power you need for most fights (bosses and elite enemies less so, but thats what friends are for!); if you can hit Head, Vitals or Grenade pouches. Rapid fire ownage. You can still make long range shots, I made a 181 meter shot, the scope just isn't as powerful, but in my experience the fight is often close enough I use the lowest zoom setting and spam shots at heads. Good for any range but CQC.Tommy Gun is good for CQC to bit logner than short, just tap trigger and aim for head.Russian pistol, very accurate, holds 8 rounds.Good for CQC to short range. When you are down on ground bleeding out you can also fire your pistols after a few seconds of being downed.Don't forget to hit space to kick over zombies and skeletons, then finish them off with a headshot.Zombies not killed by Head, Vital or Grenade will rez once more...take your time and aim.Special Zombies:Heavy Gunner, high health, slow,  uses M60 Light Machine Gun... kill them, as a group, before they get close or its game over.Skeleton, fast, attacks fast, primary weakness is a glowing heart in chest. Very dangerous.Sniper, uses Kar-98 bolt action sniper rifle I think, high damage, high mobility; they leap from sniper vantage point to sniper vantage point up on roofs and such...shoot them before they shoot you. Dangerous for solo players.Runners, they are on fire and waving a grenade...if they reach you they hold the grenade in their mouth and strike a Cross pose and explode. If you kill them, their bodies still explode...this is very likely to kill groups in scripted wave events, as you are typically croweded trying to rez a player or two who just had a run in with a pack of skeletons...and their blast radius is big and powerful.???These are all I've encountered so far."

I really dislike that you can't skip through a lot of the cut scenes. After you see them once it is more than enough.

,Recommended,227100,9295851,"Posted: 28 February, 2014",all,Schiz0id,"WOWWhere to begin?First of all, I've played most of the zombie games. You should know right now that I'm an oldschool doom fan, brutal doom is my favorite game. I've also loved the stalker series, and have played left 4 dead 2, killing floor, you name it. But don't let the ""sniper game with zombies"" title fool you- this game is a hardcore shooter.The undead in this game are relentless and walk like Romero zombies. They are, however, magically induced and not virus-induced, so don't be surprised to see some occult gibberish and super zombies, skelletons, etc.The sheer amount of zombies in this game is incredible. The game loads as you play, so loading screens are very seldom seen. Also, the game is quite playable on bad systems. I think the shooting is fantastic, the smg's feel great and are varied, each gun has its advantages and disadvantages. The snipers feel great, and the x-ray deathcam, while only available in singleplayer, is simply wonderful!I really think this is a good game, but if you're expecting a non-scary breezy game, then I'm sorry to tell you this; this game is actually quite scary and tense at times. The hoarde can be scaled to fit 1-4 people amounts in single player, which I think was added since some of the poor reviews were writte, so look out for that. But the zombies in this game really do get the slip on you, and since they are magical, if you fail to hit the head they will be re-ressurrected! so BE SURE TO GET HEADSHOTS!The ammo is plentiful if you take the time to search every body. The ppsh has the most ammo, and it's quite normal to find 71 rounds for the ppsh on bodies 1 out of 5 times, I'd say.I really love this game. Get the first one first, though; the second one is kind of different, with its color filters and such. it isn't as realistic in its depiction, so start with this game first and get a feel for the world.I would give this game 4.5 out of five stars. The .5 is because the game feels simple at times, but hey, I'm a freaking doom fan so that's great to me!So get the game. It's really cheap when it goes on sale!"

,Not Recommended,227100,14369771,"Posted: 7 February, 2015",all,aVe,"I never played Sniper Elite, I was just lured by the title and a possible twist on the classical Return to Castle Wolfenstein.At first, I wad pleased to watch my best sniper shots in bullet time, but since it only happened using the sniper rifles, and considering the fact you spend most of your time shooting at close to medium range, I eventually set it to a reasonable amont.Like many modern FPS, you have to carefully choose the few weapons and grenades you carry. Zombies sometimes holds ammunition, but they disappear after a too much shorter time to take advantage of this. You play with an OTS camera, eventually hitting CTRL for a better aiming, or Right Mouse for a sniper scope.The enemies fall into a limited set of categories : swarm of slow walkers, bunch fast skeletons, one slow hard boiled giant with a machinegun, and a couple of flying snipers. Not really inspired but gives up some adrenaline rush in closed quarters.The overall level design is pretty good, leaving you with several camp sites or hides to run to. Plus, the recreation of ravaged Germany is convincing. Unfortunately, these levels are filled with fog that brought my computer to the knees and the rendering shaky.I eventually reached the final boss in the chapel, but the unability to have a smooth aim ruined the final battle.Overall all, Sniper Elite : Nazi Zombie Army is more a recreational shooter, that you might enjoy as a filler if you happen to have a decent computer to run it (apparently, gameplay videos on Youtube looked like it was possible)."

As no weapon is supressed and enemies immedately know your location.There are a few pro(s) and con(s) about his game;Pro(s) :- Good graphics ( on a game that you only spend $14.99 on )- Control lay out feels beautiful ( Went on inital playthrough using Microsoft XBOX 360 remote )- A good variation of weapons to choose from ( It only takes through the first ""chapter"" to know what your favorite one is )Con(s) :- Game feels repitive with gameplay- Enemies all look the same- Every ""chapter"" has the same layout- Lacking StorylineOverall :Great game for solo playing and can provide a better gameplay if done through co-op.Highly recommend this game!8/10- Poser Punx"

Finding vantage points is worthless because if you can see the enemy, they've already spawned at close range and are shambling toward you, and if you can't see the enemy, it's because they haven't magically spawned yet. You can look all day and you won't see them until you cross that invisible line to spawn them. Monitoring enemy movements is useless; they're either aware and coming right for you, or they don't exist yet. And actual opportunities to actually play as an elite sniper are few and far between. You're much better off ditching the Garand and sticking to shotguns and machine guns.Why would anyone do this to a sniper game? You'd have to be some kind of brain-dead Nazi."

Although the game is very fun while playing solo, I can see the game being much more fun playing with friends for strategies can be employed and of course you can alter the game to spawn many more zombies than normal.There are multiple difficulties to choose from as well as zombie counts to be changed, the more players you play with, the more zombies you can add.  Of course you can play solo on the hardest difficulty with the most amount of zombies but I do not recommend it.  Each zombie count available to choose is titled for how many players you're playing with, so for an example the 3-Player zombie count is recommended for 3 player.Overall this game is a very fun zombie game recommended to be played with friends but can also be played solo if you're a zombie fanatic."

,Recommended,227100,13952943,"Posted: 11 January, 2015",all,Ikrani,"Kiss realism goodbye, because this game does not give two sheits about plausibility.While the campaign may only have a few levels, each one of those levels is a good length with a variety of ways to maim, maul and murderize the opposing undead, ranging from blowing them up with dynamite to making their heads explode with your side arm. Ammo is harder to find for some weapons, so constantly relying on your submachine gun and sidearm can sometimes get you into a tight spot.Headshots are really the only way to ensure the undead stay dead, lest they comeback to life. There are certain areas where what appear to be already-dead bodies turn out to be not-quite-dead-yet bodies, adding to the level of tension as you have to go around seeking sleeping corpses to put down while conserving your precious ammo. Those zombies you do kill disintegrate after a while, meaning you have to divide your time between fighting and looting ammo before it vanishes.The enemies in this game aren't particularly varied, what with two basic grunts, one fast-moving suicide bomber, one heavy weapons zombie (which can be real pain in the♥♥♥♥♥to kill by yourself), one undead sniper variant who can leap tall buildings in a single bound, and one boss. However, the game makes up for this by keeping the spaces tight and only allowing you breathing room when there's about fifty or so enemies trying to kill you.The Slow-Mo camera is there, and while it does keep the game interesting it can get a little annoying after a while when every kill you make is gratuitously showcased for your carnal boredom.The only complaints I have are the lack of scenery variety, the lack of enemy variety, and the fact that the characters don't really have much character to grow attached to like their Call of Duty counterparts. These are issues I hope were addressed in this game's sequel. Despite this, Sniper Elite: Nazi Zombie Army is still really enjoyable, easily replayable escapist fun."

If you like to spray and pray then wave after wave of zombies is cool. But the problem is that there isn't enough ammo for your secondary weapon in the whole world. The zombies move so erratically that their heads are too hard to hit. A head shot is needed to stop a zombie from regenerating.I have tried again and again and again to beat this game. It is so frusterating. I can't. But I had no problem with the original Sniper Elite. I am at the part where you are trying to get to the church and there are about 50 zombies and one of those big killer machine gun guys.

You'll encounter standard zombies, special zombies (brute, sniper and speedy) and various monsters such as the 'ever-so-annoying fire creatures'.The shooting mechanics are just like Sniper Elite V2's, with the performance being just as good too! Your character is still controlled in exactly the same way, no significant changes have been made.Visual-wise, the characters and world/levels are still highly detailed like Sniper Elite V2's, apart from this time many of the levels have been laid out and altered to appear more Arena-like. This can be a negative at times because the sniping mechanics become less effective at close range. Like the predecessor, the close-range weapons still fail to 'pack a punch' meaning you'll find yourself spraying bullets everywhere every-so-often.Apart from the changes to the lighting, enemies (& AI) and some new weapons added, the game is still very similar to its predecessor. The Slow-motion, X-ray bullet cams are still there but because the zombies are 'rotting', the textures for the organs and bones have been changed to look more rotten and decaying. These new textures unfortunately don't look as great as the originals, which means I found the perfectly shots I'd taken a little less satisfying (This isn't a big issue though).All in all, a solid co-operative game. If you liked Sniper Elite V2, then this game is like a co-op single-player from that game, only with zombies and horror. It hasn't revolutionized the series, but it's a fairly good game nevertheless!"

Departing from even the regular series stream (which I actually prefer, and which I have enjoyed, as the 'sniper' designation fits those games very well), this is an almost entirely 'shoot em up' based game, which appears to ditch the sniper aspect of the series, referring you instead to level after level of 'survive this horde by blasting them away'.  There's such a serious lack of strategy here, that - after logging in about 5 hours total - I don't think I've been able to play through an entire round (of killing endless mobs of nearly identical enemies), without becoming strikingly bored and disinterested.  Much like the Dead Island series fell flat, and brought its share of disrepute to the zombie/undead game genre, this is a similarly forgettable addition to the zombie gaming series.  For future developers - the golden rule of content in gaming is; if you have nothing unique to add to a genre beyond a mildly entertaining shoot-em-up action game, then you'd best leave it to the developers who have real experience and expertise in the genre, instead of wading into an unfamiliar genre with mixed results at best.

The weapons feel accurate to their real-world counter-parts (I've fired a few of these, not all) and the sniping action is tactile and addicting. The 4-player co-op will keep you playing till you get ""single-man's arm"" provided you get a good connection (about 50% of the time time it's perfect, and 50% of the time is tolerable but never bad). The level design feels like a linear corridor at first, but you'll quickly realize that there are windows to leap through, choke points for booby traps, hallways for ""funnels of death"" and open areas for killing fields.

,Recommended,227100,2777523,"Posted: 2 March, 2013",all,ConfuciusBruh,"Fun game and pretty well priced for what it is. Not as fun as I thought it would be because it gets a little repetitive, eg: clear village, find safehouse, fend of zombies attacking, next village. The zombies are pretty cool though. I would recommend this if your a zombie shooter fan and want to play an arcade style zombie game with friends. overall rateing 7.5/10"

Shooting nazis in the face is as American as apple pie. But what about nazi zombies? Would you like to shoot some of those in the face too? If your answer is yes then buy this game. Rebellion is a solid developer and this game is fun if not a bit repetitive.

This game offers a challenging, and intense adventure while trying to survive the never ending horde of Nazi zombies everywhere.  This game is best played with friends in coop mode, although playing in single player mode is much more fun.EDIT:  March 19, 2014After trying out this game with a few of my friends I can honestly say, STAY AWAY FROM IT!  Everything is great until you start to play Cooperative Mode.  Laggy as hell, you get dropped by the game so many times, it just becomes outright frustrating.  The other Major problem is communication between players.  There is no OPTION in the game to make it OPEN MIC and so the Push To Talk becomes tedious and very upsetting.  We have never been able to finish the game because of one glitchy problem after the next.  You shoot a zombie, and u feel like your shooting blanks.  the shots won't register for about 2 full seconds.  A delay that none of us care for.  And people have left the game because it's just too much trouble.  There's no real checkpoint where u can start over again without ending up in the beginning of the level again.  and there are no options for this either.  What is sad is that this game could've been perfect if there were updates to fix these so called glitches.  Yet, they still exist.  If there is no support for this game, i think STEAM should STOP selling it.  Nobody wants to pay for an UNSUPPORTED GLITCHY game that later u will just want to bury it deep in it's own grave along with the glitchy zombies.  What a disappointment.  Buyer Beware!EDIT: July 21, 2017since my last review on March 19, 2014, the game has had many patches and updates and is now working perfectly. you still need skype to communicate, but it's a minor inconvenience to me now. i updated my graphics card and it seemed to fixed the many problems that upset me (the previous card was not being supported any longer by Nvidia). in short, this is a very entertaining game, and i definitely recommend it now that it's fixed."
,Recommended,227100,33698448,Posted: 21 July,all,Avro,"I'm pretty sure I never wanted to see a bullet pass through a zombie's testicle but this game showed me anyway.Sniper Elite is a franchise that's well known for showing X-Ray Critical hits in tremendous detail.Nazi Zombie Army is the first of 2 other game's out right now, the third game being the Trilogy which includes the first two games remasted along with a third campaign.The game's main objective is still the same as the regular Sniper Elite which is ""take out hitler"" ball shot or not but you get to do it in Zombie apocalypse mode instead!.It's a great game to pick up on sale to play with either your friends or by yourself and is definitly something just about anyone would enjoy playing!"
