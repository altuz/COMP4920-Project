Be prepared to lose resorces for winning pvp matches.That's right you lose for winning! If a person trys to fight you and you accept and then he pays you to flee battle you get a win and maybe a little gold from the payout BUT you will lose 5k food 5k wood and 5k stone from your towns resorce stash which varries depending on what your stash has in it but that was my last loss to this bug. Not only do you lose for winning a pvp match in this manner you don't recieve the crowns for the win that you are supposed to get for winning.The only way to avoid this bug is to fight until the game tells you you won or lost.BUGS! That's right more bugs.This one however is in your favor.When creating troops to build an army some times you will dupe extra units.BUGS! Your city is full of small bugs that are annoying at times but minor and not worth more then a mention that thay are there.THE MOTHER OF ALL BUGS! This is a big one in my opinion! Be prepared to lose it all! That's right and not because you can be captured or destroyed by another player but because everytime the dev's change the game some people not all but at random get a full wipe including your account like you never exisited in the first place. The money you spent ""poof gone"" the time you spent ""poof gone"". I know this first hand as both my maxed out city's got wiped and in return i didn't even get a response from the support team. After the first time i said ""ok i haven't played in a wile no big deal i lost my stuff"" and i moved on rebuilt spent money on the starter packs and was back on top in a few weeks and that's when the dev's changed the game again and i lost it all again.Sense the game came out pre f2p i have put about 60$ into the game and 288 hours which i wish at this point i had not but if you don't mind losing it all and spending money and time on a game so that a bug can rob you in the end then this game is for you!There are some cool things about kingdom wars but the amount of bugs makes the amount of cool things not worth the mention as the bugs destroy the enjoyment all together.The dev's don't really care about the game the bugs have been there forever and have never been fixed the team took what was supposed to be an update to kingdom wars and made it a stand alone game ""kingdom wars 2: battles"" which is the same game with a cuple added fetures.The team only did this to pump more money out of people instead of fixing and updating the game they had already created ""Kingdom wars"" leaving KW broken and a waste of time and money.In the end i can't say i recommend any games from this team as they don't put any real care into the games they create beyond publishing bug filled crap they have no intention to fix."

This one is neither, through the efforts of the developers and a great part of the community it has worked toward something truly unique. I have played my share of games that had Pay to Win (or elements of it) schemes going on in the background, yet never had I seen one where the developers actually completely changed the game because of critisism from the players themselves... I know of no better community of players then the ones who stalk the digital halls of Kingdom Wars, (it's the only game that I leave the chat window open on) when there was a shortage of Moderators the players themselves would offer advice to the new arrivals. Simply put, my hours should speak for themselves, and I intend to continue for a long time.Many people have claimed that Kingdom Wars is rough around the edges, that it is, but those same people usually don't stick around enough to see the simple truth that we veterans know by heart... (or atleast we should by now) ""If you don't like it, spend some time and wait for the next update."" So in closing, it's fun, it's free, and no other game in the genre can come close to it's majesty!"

If you loose a sqaud of high level soilders it's not the end of the world but you feel bad.The game is almost too slow to start, but after 5-6 hours you start to see the gold coming in. You might have read it's ""pay to win"". You can spend cash for crowns which buy's you the special units or upgrades, yet after you get established it's easy to build a bank of crowns. Your gold even starts to overflow to the point where a good portion of the time your lugging your troops around from town to town selling goods.Whatever race you chose to play isn't a total lock, you can still buy units from the other races. One of the key factors is collecting your loot off of dead bodies, I strongly recomand  getting Female Wardens from the elf race because you can simply select their duty to collect loot and they do it fast compared to human peasents.The AI isn't great.  They are going to attack is how they are going to attack. Generally they don't engage you till you engage them. If they try to flank it's a pre-determined before the game even starts. The AI doesn't adjust to the battlefield and what is going on. The AI will flank when basically you already broke the line.Archers and Crossbow men are generally a strong staple of castle RTS'. They aren't effective. When you see 60-80 Archers on a castle ridge after a few times it doesn't make you turn your soilders around.The big draw back besides the lack of PvP fights, which when they do happen are very laggy is the overall Missions of the game. Basically it's fighting a small group of soilders, or laying into a castle.  Most of the missions are putting down rebel armies of peasents.The developer has been putting out patches, but the game isn't new, so I'm not sure what the future holds in stock. If they make a second one, I think they will get the game right.I enjoyed my time with the game, but with no real challange and a weak storyline that actually may not have a ending , it's hard to say ""Yes"" or ""No"" to the game.  However, if your looking to play a RTS game and can't find one I would give it a shot, it did provide me several hours of gaming."

76561197996933218,Recommended,227180,8803419,"Posted: 21 January, 2014",all,Phandaal,"Yes, this is worth getting.I've noticed a lot of negativity about this game since it's release and frankly I don't understand where it is all coming from. What you have here is a solid, fun, online RTS game, with some innovative original flourishes.Pros:= Three distinct factions with very different play styles both in terms of city building, unit disposition and battle tactics. They are further differentiated by their own distinct unit, building and UI art, quest lines and voice acting. Each faction can also recruit a variety of mercenary units to further enhance army customization.= The battle pacing is just right. Look I'm an old fart, so I prefer a game where I can actually see the action unfold rather than everything be over in the blink of an eye. The pace of combat is somewhat slower in DoF than in other contemporary RTS games. I think this is a good thing becasue it allows for more tactical options and also negates any ping advantages in multiplayer.= Heaps of single player content. Each faction has a very generous quest line which I estimate to be around 30+ hours worth per side, not counting replayable missions. There are also countless NPC skirmishes to explore in a variety of landscapes against varied NPC elements.= The quests are involved and interesting. They have put a great deal of thought into felshing out details of the fantasy world. It's not a testiment to originality, but it's a top notch effort for a video game setting. I love how half of what the elves say is made up gibberish with no explanation offered, but after an hour or so in the game you find yourself understanding it all.Cons:= There are a few technical issues especially with pathfinding, but nothing that some patience and practice can not overcome.= Multiplayer is a mixed bag. You can grind out a very formidable army against NPCs and newbies can get crushed if they dive in unprepared. That being said, when the balance is just right, they battles are a lot of fun.= Speaking of grind, there is a bit of it. It's an online game so the pace of progression is sedate. You won't max your units out over a weekend. Your rank and file units can also be permanently lost, so you need to be paying attention. I personally like the perma death touch for some units (hero units take an xp penalty instead when they get ""KOed""), but I can understand why some people would consider it a negative.All in all I had a great time with DoF. If you're an RTS fan and looking for something a little different and long term, you should definately pick this up during the sale. It's a steal for seven bucks."

The devs seem keen on taking suggestions and fixing bugs, but the base of the game is broken. Terrible UI, delayed commands, units not doing what they are supposed to, no interactive pve, broken pvp.You get shown all these amazing battles you can fight with massive armies and awesome castles you can siege. You will not see this ingame.In pvp: You will build a massive army and level them a bit only to see them destroyed in pvp by a single enemy dragon or wizard. A high level 60 dragon or wizard has the same army strenght as a fully deployed army but has many times the defense, attack and hp regeneration stats so your units will be hitting and shooting it in vain. The only way to counter is to recruit your own super monsters and you'll end up using just those.In pve: Sure you can use a massive army to siege a city and lose half of them in the progress. Or... get a dragon and/or wizard as said above and decimate the enemy castle as they cannot kill your dragon. Its easy to see which is the better option.This review will be voted as not helpful just as all the other negative reviews as the core players have been playing this game for years and are good friends with the mods/devs (who btw can and will abuse their power to restore units and ingame currency by just being nice to them) and are raging fan boys thats are just happy with 1v1 units fighting and thus destroying the idea behind this game."

I have not spent a single cent (excluding buying the game) in this game and I have an 80% pvp win/lose ratio. I also have the most expensive units ( that requires premium currency to buy) on my account. The premium currency (that you can buy) can very easily be attained through in game questing.

I seen youtube videos and these guys have been around for years updating this game and it's only been getting better and better as I have seen. It's very worth the money and building a kingdom in this one is very fun seeing there's lots of quest that keep ya busy and crowns you have to gain or buy with money you make from cattle or chopping trees and gold and stone mines. I like the experience and upgrading units. I've been on many hours since I started and there's so much more for me to go. Just now got a powerfull dragon and have been burning up lots of enemies.

I felt like I had to have a #2CON:- Plagued by a crown system which stunts your rapid growth/gameplay unless you play real $ at an outrageous price- Once you have finished your ""introductory"" crown based protection system, you have to pay more real money or use all the crowns you saved for upgrades, if you don't want to PVP. If you want to Co-Op all of the time, don't buy this game at all. It just isn't for you.- No custom castle/wall/tower building--everything is pre-designated- Requires real $ to customize your city or hero (even if it is a small amount, they quarter and dollar you) and the customization is minimal at best- Peasants are morons- Enemy AI has as much intelligence as my Mr. Coffee- Units have a tendency to just up and disappear- More bugs than a Zerg SwarmBottomline:  The game is getting older and older and not getting any better. Kingdom Wars 2: Battle has come out and I doubt they will put any effort into this game at all. If you buy it, you're feeding the green money monster."

Once you build your base, you build armies that are also PERSISTENT. So everytime you login, your base and armies are there from the last time you played and they're ready to battle.Each faction(humans, elves, orcs, +more to come...) are unique in every way. They gather resources(gold/food/wood/stone) differently. They have different units with different abilities and formations. They even have subfactions(3 subfactions per race) that make them even MORE unique by increasing/decreasing unit stats, economy, build times, etc.  Then you choose two traits from 5 or 6 options that further customize your experience with more stat boosts and whatnot.Once you've built a base, done a few quests, and trained a decent army you can either conquer the AI controlled cities(either solo or Coop with someone) or search for another player's army to fight or siege their town. The Player vs Player fights are matched up according to the strength of your army, which prevents powerful veterans from picking on new players(or vice versa depending on how good you are :D ).The best part is that anything can be earned by playing the game, except for a few items that are purely cosmetic and don't affect actual gameplay or mechanics.PROS:-Game Moderators are easily accessible and available for questions-Wizards, dragons, minotaurs, treants, hydras....that's right, HYDRAS!!-units level up and can be customized to your playstyle by spending skill points to increase health, stamina, attack, resistances, range, reload time, etc.-better than average graphics considering the size and scope of the game-massive battles with unlimited tactical possibilities where terrain, weather, and NPC patrols/camps are all factorsCONS:-some minor bugs/issues, but the developers have released more patches to address bugs in the past two weeks than in the past year, so they're committed to keeping the game running smoothly now that it's free to play.-high system requirements to run the game even on low settings-some parts are difficult to learn to play early on because tooltips and tutorials aren't very helpful, but the community of players and the moderators are great about helping outBasically, you have nothing to lose except maybe a little time and hard drive space. And if ya don't like it, delete it. But if you're like me(as you can see I've logged almost 400 hours in this game), you'll be playing it every chance you get!

This game has both a single player and multiplayer to it. It is suggested to start off with the muliplayer first so that way you can learn the game faster.If you like an RTS that is advanced but has a nice learning curve to it.

Still we all had high hopes and knew there was something special there. So the Devs still apart of development that cared about the game and wanted to see it grow, ended up ended up taking care of it out of their own pocket over the past year and a half just worked mostly for free, using the what ever means, any current sales to invest into better servers or pay for outsourcing some fixes here and there and now they released a new version on steam with many new features and updates that fixed a ton of the game making it a lot better than its first official launch.In the end, The game is very addicting, I have 4 cities, and massive armies, sure theirs many issues and bugs and sometimes horrible path finding, and pvp doesn’t always work, yes there has been major crashes but only because the game has grown so fast, there was none of these issues before, but the community and gameplay is just so rewarding I can't stop.So glad I’m done with this review, Already 70hrs in and all I want is more!

You feel accomplished when you get it right and it is awesome. Absolutely awesome. But the game mechanics are atrocious.Pros: Rewarding, new-ish style, feels like you can explore a lot.Cons:-♥♥♥♥♥♥ game mechanics: Units randomly stop firing and run into battle without attacking. This happens with super expensive units and it sets you back literally hours. Spike traps are an instant (and invulnerable) kill for your units so while sieging the enemy you may lose 20% of it regardless of what you do.-Not intuitive building (for the elves)-Everything is slow, inaccurate, frustrating, expensive, unresponsive, and repetitiveAlthough I was expecting an Age of Empires-esk game, it delivered but in a C rated experience.

(I believe the Development team should look more closely to fixing these before adding any new content.)Making sure that all NPCs that you can talk to etc… have a nice smooth crisp looking graphic design, as some do look pixelated rather than looking smooth with the rest of the NPCs.Now for the Positive:Hours of fun to be had when the bugs can be overlooked.Various races to be played (Orcs, Elves and Humans) You do also get the awesome Dwarven Armies you can build.Unique units, Kingdom Wars offers a variety of Unique Units that you can build to boost your armies’ strength and even rename them which gives you a more personal favourite feeling to your units.Quests are quite important within this game, it gets players activated as well as the PvP (Player Vs Player) and PvE (Player versus Environment) these would vary from easy to hard.Theres just so much that i could list that makes this an awesome game."

You can play offline single player modes but the online version is so easy for new players. To begin with this game is NOT ""pay to win"" it never really was but in the past about 2% of players shelled out the extra cash for some better units. Now there is NO cash shop. Instead you earn an extra type of currency called crowns by doing PVP. You can literally spend the first 24 hours of in game time just building up your city and levelling up units WITHOUT worryinging about being attacked. Your 12 hour immunity to attack BEGINS when you decide to build walls and you can hold off on the walls for 12 hours so you have a nice army and city ready to give any attackers a run for their money. The game matches you based on army strength so even when you do finally decide to PVP you will not be getting owned by players with much stronger armies, this is not the D-Bag gank festival that other PVP oriented games tend to be. Even when you do lose you still get a few crowns and your heroes do not die permanently nor are your buildings destroyed beyond repair! I am Namaste in game if you have any questions! there is tons of helpful posts in the steam forums to help get you started.

Incorperate something to the alliance portion to make your own empire seem that more impressive. IE, more costumization pertaining to your clan. visual asspects that other players can see and say ""Yep, that alliance is awesome"", or ""How can we get that?2. Incorperate add on's to own castles. This will make each castle feel more of thier own deisgn and help players create more tatics for deffense. But make small add on's with a variety of dessions to work with. some you can earn and speacial ones only given by ether successfully defending your castle a certian number of times or completing certain missions.

Combat is very micro managy (or it can be) which can be both a good thing and a bad thing. Although, I've found myself spending most of my time so far watching my hunters hunt while I wait for buildings to build. Still a very fun and in depth game.Pro's:+In depth and micro managable combat if you want to, click and swarm units if you don't want to micro.*+Fleshed out races with personalities.+Great soundtrack.+Fun animations and ai things to keep you entertained while things build.+Customizable city lay outs (for the orcs anyway, not sure about other races).+Good variety of units and upgrades.+Good PvP.+Very in depth lore that gives you a good feel for the world.Con's:-Buildings can take a very long time to build (as in a few hours real time).-Skirmish mode has to be bought.-Can be very dull at times.-Most of the quest dialog is text only, but there are still fun unit battlecries.-Graphics are about on par with Warcraft 3 (but then again, it's just as enjoyable).Overall, I recommend this game as a fun strategy game to play as a relaxing ""watch your city grow"" type of game. Especially now that it's only $4.99 USD.8/10*EDIT:This has recently come to my attention (I didn't really get into much combat earlier and I'm just now really finding out about this): Unit AI. The unit AI is really buggy and they will randomly stop attacking, run the other way, attack things you didn't want them to, and are hard to control. I still recommend this game, but just be aware of this if you buy it (or downloard it I suppose since it's now free to play)."

,Recommended,227180,12752016,"Posted: 2 November, 2014",all,Spaceballs,"So here I am 128 hours of gameplay in my first week of Kingdom Wars... The time I have spent on this game alone should speak for my overwhelming reccomendation of this game. What I still can't believe is that this game truely is Free To Play, and NOT Pay To Win. Anybody can pick up this game without spending a cent and find themselves ruling the battlefield. All it takes is a little knowledge of the economics of the game, and some good old fashion battle Skillz. This review will hopefully outline some of the awesome features included in this game, all so you, the reader, can finally jump into Kingdom Wars and finally expierence the MMORTS that is Kingdom Wars for yourself!First off, a look at the battles! What can I say except that they are truely an epic experience. The game includes battle matchmaking service that ensures you aren't being attacked, or can attack, other players outside of your own Army size and expierence. This ensures that veteran players can't simply prey on the weak newbies to the game. This is awesome as it ensures players don't often shy away from battles, and continually work on their own strategies and skills through first hand expierence. When you finally dawn that Army backed up with a royal dragon, and march to the front gates of an enemy, I guarentee your heart will skip a beat as they fly in wreaking burning havoc on the field.In addition to the gratification you will get from some PvP battle, there are countless PvE battles awaiting you in this game. The map is filled with other PvE castles and towns that are available to attack. In addition, after winning any of these battles you will have the option to loot them for Crowns, OR make them your own vassal, increasing your resource collection rate, and allowing you to recruit troops outside your own race.For those looking for a solid economic simulation, rest assured, you can find that in Kingdom Wars. A lot of the micromanaging has been eliminated from the simulation mode by adding the ability to select your workers and assign them tasks from their menu bar. This works GREAT in battle especially, as when fires break out during a seige you can simply click on the peasant and assign them to fire fighting, and off they go douse the flame preventing further damage. For those that enjoy the micro managing part of this, you can still individually click on your workers and send them to specific duties still.Workers duties don't just stop at your city. You can also establish work camps throughout your region, filling them with workers assigned to tasks on the map, such as wood cutting, gold mining, ore mining, and farming. Managing these camps is even simpler, all it requires is some simple clicking through an economics screen that lets you add workers or subtract them to tasks. This tool is also used at cities that have become your vassal, but in addition, have the ability to setup trade routes to other cities, further expanding your resource gathering.My favorite part so far with the game has actually been the fact I started playing prior to Halloween and was pleasantly surprised to see that the game gets so much developer attention they released a Halloween package that included an ""Eternal Night"" for the holiday.I could truely go on and on about the many features this game includes, but every minute I spend typing this review I feel my anxiety increasing from being away from my own game. That all being said it should be mentioned that there are some minor issues with the game still. On a couple occassions it has froze while loading a PvP battle, and I have found some resources missing a time or two. However, their is nearly always an Moderator or Developer on whom is ready to issist and remedy these issues. I am stunned by how much the developer team cares to ensure a solid game play expierence. In addition, it doesn't matter if you have purchased premium content or not, the DEV team still give you amazing service in navigating a small hiccup here or there. Plus, with nearly daily updates to the game, these small problems are quickly dissapearing.After playing a dozen or so ""Free To Play"" games and always being dissapointed in how much an advantage players who purchased premium content would have over others, I am simply in bliss finally finding a game where the broke the college student could come on and have an enjoyable escape without forking over their tuition money in order to do so..."

Dawn of Fantasy: Kingdom Wars is the first and ,as of writing this review, only 3D massively-multipleyer-online real-time-strategy game. At first glance, it seems as though these two characterizations could in no way combine together to form a fluent game that's fun to play. Dawn of Fantasy does this almost perfectly. The game takes place in a mideival era with elements inspired by fantasy. The game takes a healthy dose of inspiration from titles such as Age of Empires and Strongholds Legends while still remaining origional and unique. DoF is easy to pick up and play if you are experienced in the RTS genre, but can be challenging if this is your first strategy game. What makes the game unique is that it is in a persistent world that keeps on going even after you log off. while this may sound like a bad thing to you, it truly isn't. While you are away, you can't be attacked by other players and production of any units or construction of any building will not be halted. DoF manages itself well so you don't have to worry while you are away. The game's player-versus-player isn't overpowered either: you won't have to worry about being attacked by players with armies that could overthrow a galactic empire. Instead, you will only be faced against armies that match your own army with a slight 10% deviation. You also won't be attacked by anyone until you construct walls around your city, which isn't mandatory to continue playing the game but not having walls means that you can't play co-operatively with your friends.As soon as you do construct walls though, the game really gets into the most fun parts. As well as being attacked by enemies, you can team up with your friends and wage war against players and NPC's alike. With a game this amazing, you'd think that it would use microtransactions so players could pay-to-win. That is not the case in Kingdom Wars. As of January 10th, 2014 buying your way to victory with in-game currency has been disabled: meaning that the only way you can make money in the game is (Plot Twist!) to play it!

,Recommended,227180,9617187,"Posted: 24 March, 2014",all,Xyrith,"There are currently three races to choose from, the empire/town emulation is fazed out quite quickly as you discover a drawn out grind fest to level a single army and any heroes you earn or buy. You can earn heroes and elite units buy generating gold and buying premium crowns or simply buying them with money, you will end up with a single army with a hero or two and several camps generating gold. The PvP will only include a hero setting fires to kill your non elite units and a hero that can solo any regular elite units, you will only have the option to counter a certain hero or just ending up co oping PvE sieges to gain crowns faster.I recommend simply clearing your home town map of quests and enemies then upgrading your resource gathering tools and start trading off extra resources you do not end up using on 2nd/3rd tier units. You want any upgrades that increase your gold income and you want to travel to neighboring towns and find which resource they pay for the most and setting up a camp nearby with that said resource. After you have three maxed camps set up generating resources set up another of all storage traveling units to trade and a single army of 25 2nd/3rd tier tanks, 25 2nd/3rd tier ranged DPS and either 9 town workers to gather resources off dead bodies or 5 of them and 4 storage traveling units. The last slot will be for either your starting hero or a crown bought one, leave your army out of your hometown so no one will attack it but if they do make sure to either have a single hero there or walls with long ranged dps mounts. Gold is key.Support is weak as they run with a small team so wiki and check forums for any issues or wait for the newest Empire Expansion to come out."

There nothing in the game you can buy with real $$$$ that will help you in battle in pvp or pve. Every thing done with in game reasouces.-Customzation. If you download it in the free to play version. You can buy Custom hero looks and city buidling. So you can make the city and your hero fit more to how you like. Sadly the Custom look not free cost like 3 bucks but that is understandible snice the devs still need to make money. For the poeple who go the game before when is cost 20 bucks. Devs were cool, and fair to give us the Customs for free. Snice we already threw in 20.- RPG/RTS Mix. Game got a good mix for a rpg and rts. You have a hero that will lead your army and interact with quest. All units gain lvl with xp were you can increase there attack, hp, range ect. Unless your unit a hero they can die. So game make you think on to lvl your units and keep them alive to reach higher lvls for more powerful units.- Factions. Game have 3 factions with there own play style. They play a role for pve but for pvp their no down side. You can play humans and your freinds can be orcs or elfs.- Fair PVP. pvp set up goes threw army and city power. So you never have some one who has a army for example. 1000 power attack your army of 340 power. You can challange poeple with higher power army but you never have to worry about going up aginst some one who op as hell. Puting that down it goes to skills and army set up wins the battle.-Active dev team. Got to say I always see these guy on the fourms answering and fix issue and bugs in the game.Cons.-Grapichs. Got to hit the basic.. Frist the citys and country side look great. But the Combat and units are not overly amazing.  (This can change in the Future.)- Sounds. The sounds over lay in the game not the best you hear some units fighting with sounds and some with out sounds.(Can change if devs work on it.)-Bugs. game still bugy. ya ya I know the devs are working on it still but Until it fix I leting poeple know game still got a few bugs.More Imerrsions, more units more citys. I see stuff in the loading screen with ships and some town info talking about ships. There like 4 areas in the world map that are empty. You can go in them and fight pve still but there not much gain. Possible that it just intel for things to come later.OVERALL . I still recomend the game.

The graphics/textures may not be AAA quality but they get the job done. The textures are greatly overcome by the stunning lighting and ambient sounds. The three races are very unique and all fun to play and each come with their own strategic playstyles. The City building is especially fun to show off and makes defending them a whole lot more important. The pathfinding needs some work and there is a ton of lag in PvP as there are no Australian servers. The battles are quite overwhelming with the vast amount of units and micro managing is very tedious as unit selecting is glitched.

Essentially this game is a single player game with multiplayer matchmaking. You develop your humble little hamlet all the way to a thriving medeviel metropolis, micromanaging each detail along the way. At least until you get familiar with the MANY shortcuts the game has to offer, for those people not interested in examining each element of your lemmings life. For those who do, however the game rewards you! One example of this is in your main city, creating a more efficient system for gold to be mined, will actually help more than just clicking on your lemmings (peasants) and telling them to mine gold.There is no shortage of depth in this game, while you may indeed find it a bit lonely I think you will easily discover (as is typical) the long list of NPC questions will give you a more ""roleplay"" (or if you are a hipster, ""immersion"") value with go for a very long time.True to it's boast this game is not a play to win game, of all the games I have seen with a dollar to virtual economy, this game doesn't punish you for buying ""crowns"" but you won't get any real shortcut for doing so either. Even people who have to buy crowns will need to spend ""days"" building their city.Which brings me to my next point, one of the most attractive elements of this game is setting up your ""peasant factory"" to do stuff for you while you are offline, or even playing in another kingdom, or better yet going on quests or doing many other things so you don't need to manage every detail, truly making you feel more like a leader. Just as well your leader can avoid combat or jump in to the fray at whatever style works for you.The thematic fantasy style brings to light many different stories that could easily fit just about any medievel genre, from Lord of The Rings, to Elder Scrolls, or even Dungeons and Dragons and the storyline and overall build of the world of Dawn of Fantasy is freeform so as not to handicap your imagination.This is the main part of the game, an immensely deep and enjoyable user friendly simple single player RTS with an optional matchmaking, I suppose you can consider it a massive multiplayer RTS, but I feel it is more as I have described. However, this is just the main part of the game, the game comes with a powerful 3d Editor and a single player version of the game that is much more strategy oriented but just as deep and entertaining.Oh yea, it is worth buying! would I suggest buying crowns? Yes, crowns could help late game and speed up getting to the late game, as they are necessary to purchase higher power units and may take a lot of time to get in game (mainly because you will use those crowns for upgrading)."

Although some poeple felt that it was pay to win, it was not in the least bit since I never spent a dime on it and still was able to pve and pvp without problems.  Still to this day now that it's F2P, you still don't have to pay for anything since your armies are always matched with people of similar armies.  It's a really good way of handeling a cash shop.  If you don't want to pay any money, you will have to learn how to play is all, which isn't a bad thing.It was a buggy game when I first got a hold of it, as most newish games, and that did deter me for about 4 months.  After a while they had a few patches that made it less laggy for me and that's when I started racking up the hours, Building more cities, destroying more foes, and gathering those crowns for more armies.  I grew up playing RTS games, Age of Empires was my first multiplayer game, and I played that for a couple of years along with Empire earth when it came out.  This has strong elements of your typical RTS, but it has so much more.  Long term cities, taking over NPC towns, exploring the map, questing, and co-op sieging just to name a few great things that seperate it from your standard RTS.I had so much fun that I invited a few friends to play with me and after teaching them how to play we were pillaging empires left and right.  When you play with friends, it usually makes a game that much more fun.  You invite friends, your friends invite friends, etc..  Soon you can start an alliance with people you know that you will get along with.  Although you can only 2v1 vs AI, and 1v1 in pvp, hopefully later in the games life they can expand that.   Good times were spent on sieging cities with a friend.I wasn't too interested in the MMO part of this game at first, I had played world of warcraft for about 2 years back in 2008, and grew out of it, but this game fits right in and youre not overpowerd by MMO nerds sitting on a♥♥♥♥♥♥bucket and trying to hit on a night elf.   I grew up playing age of empires, empire earth, and starcraft.  Although this game isnt on the same level, it's still tons of fun.  More of a long term RTS.Since I bought the game, fast forward to today, Reverie has had many great patches that improved the game immensely, and with the launch of their FtP model, it's better than ever.  New units, new buildings, better performance, vassels, and unit balencing (and that's just the tip of the iceberg)Also, I have a guide on my profile for new players to get some all arounds tips for the game.9/10  Unique, fun, cheap, and helpful devs/mods.

The singleplayer is straight forward but the online is rather unique allowing you to build a home city that acts as your main hub to build forces, upgrade and defend against incoming invaders. The battles can be very epic along with sieging another player's city or a npc one but sadly there is a bunch of issues such as balancing as there is many high level units that can destroy pretty much anything and of course you could be invaded by anyone making it a bit painful when your starting out going against a high level with a huge army against your 2 tower defense with 1 milita.There is also a few bugs such as units getting stuck, path finding a bit broken (units can't always get through broken doors or walls to advance into a castle, siege equipment not mounting properly and workers not mining or building properly.Overall it's a decent take on RTS but can be fustrating a lot of times in multiplayer due to the balancing issues."

76561198052036021,Recommended,227180,12827606,"Posted: 7 November, 2014",all,rebelsin7,"I actually bought the game back in the day, stumbling upon it during a massive sale. At the time, I wasn't particularly impressed, as it lacked a lot of the freedom of your typical city-builder, and the progress seemed slow enough that I wondered if I'd ever see my town grow into a city before losing interest in the game.In retrospect, I think I had largely missed the point.As it has gone free-to-play, firstly, I'm glad it avoided the pittfalls of becoming a pay-to-win game in the process, as the two more often than not go hand-in-hand. My town is still small and undeveloped, and as more of a city-builder myself, I have yet to really go deep into the siege/warfare aspects of the game. The controls for that, in what little of it I have engaged in, were a little clunky and troops were difficult to manage, but it seemed that it was surmountable, and that with time and experience, one could probably master the warfare system, should they be inclined to do so.As a city-builder, which is where I'm coming from, it is a bit limited, as you don't really choose where buildings go as freely as you do in most others. That said. it has been fun seeing my town grow, and stocking it with a large enough garrison to defend myself against any potential attackers. In fact, the game is probably more comparable to an online game I used to play called Travian, but it is very polished graphically in comparison, and much deeper in terms of variability and different units/buildings.The slow pace of the game might deter some, but I've come to enjoy stopping by every so often to see how many resources my villagers have accumulated. I check in once every other night or so, and in that span they've usually cobbled together enough stuff for me to be able to signifiantly add to my town with each log in.All-in-all, it's not a game for everyone, and it limits the freedom of both the city-builder and the strategy/siege models, however in return it provides both of those in one game, doing something unique and playable, to me anyway. There's a lot in here for one game, and not necessarily too much, as is so often the case these days.The price is right, these days, so it's certainly worth giving a shot, and remember to log in a few times before giving up on it, if you're not enjoying it so much. It wasn't until my fifth login or so that I started realizing that I was actually having fun with the game. Be that a critique or not, I recommend the game as it currently stands."

Crowns you only get with quests or sieging AI cities or other players cities. Crowns are needed for wizards, dragons and also for building your castle and buildings. You also need crowns to upgrade buildings.You can do quests on strongholds co-op and you can do siege on a AI city in co-op. You can also attack a player in the field and find out who is better. Loosing is cruel as winner can choose units from your left over army.Building your own castle is great. Size of the castles in this game is the way it should be. This is your home and you want to protect it at all cost.Building all kinds of buildings in castle or outside it like archery and upgrading it is like your normal  command and conquer style as your armies get stronger with levelling up.Next to that you can build extra armies with wizards, dragons, humans, elves or orcs. You can choose a few types of wizards and dragons to make a good mix with elves, humans and orcs. This with limitations to dragons and wizards to an army.Sieging an other player is a tactical mind game you want to win. Defending your castle against another player is not for the faint-hearted. Next to that you have several computer AI cities on the world map. These are rated from easy to epic. The AI is not easy to beat you need all your skills and a well balanced army to defeat it.One of the things I found a bit stopping the fun is that you need to buy an alliance for 500 crowns. This to create an alliance. It should be free as it would help new players to help each other quicker now you have to hope you get let in when alliance recruiters are online if not no chance.Another thing I think is wasting to much time is the skill points. This should be automatic but maybe reason is that manual doing it gives more variety. Anyway it is a time consuming thing when you are in the middle of a battle when units level up.If something goes wrong with an army or something else you can send them an email or contact moderators in the chat channel and they will give you your lost army or other things back. This also helps them to work further on these bugs. Yes there are still some there. More information will make it easier for them to solve it."

I guess once you lvl up your units it will somewhat blend in as there are caps...Main types of people you can play ORCS, Elfs and Human. I play Human as my main and Orcs... I hate elves!!!It is not a Pay to win game as it has a system to match people up to somewhat equal balance. The graphics are great, now I have a power house machines so I can't really speak if there is lag or Frame rate issues as I get max all the time. The map and fights are pretty dynamic and if you are a Total War fan this might be your game!! It is also a full RTS game no turn base crap which is nice. I have a O.K army with 1 Red Dragon and a few Minotaurs LOVE Minotaurs. Most people have a lot of playing methods. lots of people like Archers and some like things that can run fast and destroy Archers like Minotaurs hehe. Your Kingdom is setup in such a way that if you get a attacked you have a chance to win if you play smart. You will always retain your Castle if you lose and it is pretty easy to fix it back up.  I would suggest playing solo a few matches to see what your base can do and find the weaknesses.There are plenty of people so lvling up makes it easy. You can lvl up really fast so don't think you will be left behind, this games some what take care of that weakness really good. They have units that you can buy with crowns find out what type of fighter you want to be then unless your power...Crowns that word can be scary but like I said this is not a Pay to win game.... So you can earn crowns pretty easy by fighting and doing all the quest... Now I hope the devs still do this, but they are know to give out 100 crowns for just being nice in chat.... or helping others, I have received close to 300 crowns in total over the years.Devs,, they listen for the most part and seem to have a great connection to the chat channels, patches come out pretty quick and all the extra content is free.PS there is a way to have to have a full Dwarf Army very bad♥♥♥♥♥ I have 50% full army now that I am lvling up.Thank for reading my wall of text.....

With the recent launch of their Free to Play experience I've spent the last few days catching up on all the changes.Game Details:This is a long term City Building Game with a RTS Campaign Map / Battlefield Map with PvE and PvP aspects.City Building:- This plays like any resource cap / population cap / building plot game.- You establish an economy of food / wood / stone and gold.- You use these resources (along with renown) to build better buildings / defenses and units.- You also upgrade your technology and other improvements.Campaign Map:- The map has the 3 racial zones along with NPC and Endgame Zones.- Here you move your armies around which open up the various gameplay elements.- You can trade by actually loading up an army with transports and resources/currency and moving them to an NPC town you would like to trade with.  Each town opens up to you as you advance your influence.- You can also battle the NPC towns and make them 'vassals' of your main town.- You can enter open world combat (instanced random map based on your location) along with building various camps to provide a defensive start to these combat areas.- The map does not show the thousands of other player cities, however you can engage in PvP matches or sieges.Battle Map:- Here is where you (in real time) engage in troop movements and combat.- This plays like a simplified Total War game with basic unit based formations.- The actual units themselves have a bit more complexity and individuality due to ranks and the way you can upgrade them.Review:Overall this is a fun, laid back type of game that you can log in for a few minutes or hours and feel accomplished.City Building:- I like the graphics, turned all the way up there are some nice lighting and textures.  This is not 'the best looking' game, however they have done well enough to keep immersion.  My only complaint is with how they implemented lightning during storms.- The plots are pre planed (so you build walls, and they show up where the walls should go).  You do get some choice in where to build specific buildings, but you still must choose predefined locations.  This took some getting used to and I'm not sure that I like it.Orcs can build anywhere if this is your thing.- The three races give distinct city building and resource gathering flavors.  With that said there are more than 1 way to acquire any of the required resources.  I like this.- City building is a long term game.  Things continue when you are logged off; and once you've spent your resources for the day there is little left to do here.  This is great for the quick maintenance fix it seems I have with games.- This quick logon goes well with daily booster rewards.World Map:- I like the style of the world map.  The art flavor for the different zones makes it easy to tell what area you are looking at.  With that said, the map is smaller than I would like.- I also think they got the army movement speed right, where it is not instant; giving you a sense of distance; while not taking forever and a day to cross the map.- Beyond that, not much to say about the world map.  It provides access to the game functions.Battle Map:- I really enjoy that you can take an army out, go to a zone that has whatever you like to fight, and then engage in whatever type of combat that you like.  This gives the 30+ minute gameplay angle.- You can decide to farm if that is your thing (resources, experience, even units).- The rock / paper / scissors unit types work well.  There is enough variety that you can get the gameplay you enjoy.- I wish that grouped units had more formation control.- Since you can upgrade specific aspects (such as resistance) of the units you have, you can create shock troops or a tanky army.  I like the variety.No pvp comments as I've not gotten there yet."

Kingdom Wars actually gives you a bit of background on what's going on in the world. A reason to go out and conquer.  Being the huge nerd that I am, I am part of a renaissance group who studies and reenacts historical battles in real life. I like the diversity of figthers and fighting styles. Halbreders are good against horses, sword men with shields are good against defending arrows and so on. This gives battle a bit more realism for me.  On top of that there is customization to your heros and armies and it's not rediculously expensive to do so. This is one of the few free to play games I acutally put money into customization because I know I will play it for awhile. There is a slight lack of options in the customization department but it is a young game still and I am sure that will grow. All in all I think the game is pretty great so far."

,Recommended,227180,15500822,"Posted: 23 April, 2015",all,Minoru,"Kingwom Wars I still remember my thrill when I heard about this game being released. If I had to explain this game in one sentence it would be: The game is like Travian, Tribal Wars, ... but in real time 3D RTS mode.I have little play time on steam, that is because steam release was buggy at start, it payed off more to play using official launcher, meaning not using steam. The gameplay is simple, you start with a town which you upgrade. It has no deep depth of techology, it is rather simple and straight forward. You do not even need super strong economy to get decent army. I mostly play Elfs since I find their economy and troops most suitable to me (Archers :) ). Game has single player and multiplayer side which do no differ too much. You can play singleplayer offline with no problems, multiplayer gets you closer to other players. Multiplyer is same as singleplayer but you can go into CO-OP battles with other players, either with or against them. Maximum players inbattle are 2v2, which is kinda limiting. Guild/Clan/Alliance has meaning in terms helping each other during attacks. Game itself looks like Total wars series where troops and cities are managed on global map, while battle itself is in spirit of total war series where 2 armies clash. Combat system is same as with total war series archers(mounted, foot, crossbows), infantry(heavy knights, pikemen, swordsmen), cavalry (one type mounted knight, elfs have mounted archers), monsters with orcs etc. Each unit formation could lvl till 20 and had stat points for you to manually upgrade which provides decent ammount of depth. Each unit type has its special skills, where some have to be researched using crows, which are acquired with battles and quests.At start it was that simple, during time game developers kept close contact with comunity and invested great time to fixing bugs and providing new content. At release time game was once time purchase, now it is free to play model with premium. New content added mages, dragons, dwarfs, new heroes/special units, sieges but for all of it you need massive ammount of crowns which arent easy to get. There are also some bugs where you spend 250 crowns, but s*it happens, server reverses your upgrade and town state and u lose 250 crowns which finally made me quit game.Game itself is fun and worth playing, developers are moving forward and wont forsake the game, but KW2 is comming and you can feel that they are more focused on that release. Have fun it is nice game."

I spend hours in the world. it's lore is very deep but could be further made aware to the player. Building your city is fun but once you ""get"" everything you need you won't need to do keep track of it. Which can be a good or bad thing depending on how you play. The units are interesting and can be upgraded to increase their armor and attack. Combat is fun but if you play with someone else the lag can kill your game experience. Overall the game is a fun experience that you can get lost in for hours at a time. 8/10"

I've really enjoyed the city building process, and building an army. Castle sieges seem a bit slow, but they are still fun. This isn't a game I normally sit down to play for hours on end (though I have a couple times). To me it's more fun for a quick jump in and out of. When I have 30-40 minutes of free time I'll get on to manage my peasants, build my army, or do a quick battle.

You don't have to pay. You only pay for the game with everything in it. Nothing forces you to pay. Not sure if that feature is still in the game though.Also I saw one review saying that you have to join the game by signing up on their website. That is not true although You have to register ingame and then receive an confirmation email for you to complete the registeration. This process do not take more than two minutes. You are required to do this in order to play the game online with friends and others. That's it.Anyway my review...Overall and ongoing, it is a fun game. I enjoy playing against AIs enemies as well as players whilst doing the storyline. I use the term, storyline, very loosely because it is almost very direct but you can do the quests whenever and in your own time. Yes, the game can and should have been better than what it is at the moment but I don't complain because it is a decent game.However it can be ugly due to cutscenes when you have conversations with some certain characters in the ""storyline."" The characters, by looking very closely, they look like they came from 90s games like Castle Strike or the old Warcraft series unless I forget to improve the graphics in the settings lol but that is manageable anyway because you don't look that closely often.Overall, I would say this is 7/10. Better than some games but could have been better."

I have about 90 hours in the game at the moment, but with the new progress on the game right now, I can't wait to get back into the game. The developers are communicative and work with community to make the game better for everyone. The game reqiures strategic units and positioning to overcome defenses and overwhelming numbers. Kingdom Wars also allows you to make a town from scratch and build it into a fortress, along with controlling massive armies to conquer the many cities on the map. The progression of your city is slow but that make every little addition to your city feel huge. The campaign is mostly missions to keep you busy and have something interesting to do, but they give a good amount of gold. You are allowed to choose between three races: elves, humans, and orcs. Each have their own strengths and defenses, which means a variety of different play styles, thus giving the game replay value if you ever wish to restart. I definitely would recommend this game to any of my friends because it also allows you to team up with them to take down strongholds and do missions. If I was to rate this game on a scale of 1 to 10, I would say it was a 12. Kingdom Wars is phenomenal and I can't wait to see what they have in store for it in the future."

It has a very unique style in its class, a great community, and Devs who listen and respond to its players. The game provides plenty of features, lots of different tactics to try, and does a good job rewarding you for hard work. Let's break it down:The GOOD:- Lots of units to mix match and unlock- I love research, upgrading, and expanding. Everything from buildings to individual units- Crazy epic and awesome units are immortal. Meaning when you save up all your crowns to get that dragon. You love him, pet him, and feed him, give him a great home and BAM! Some glory dragon slayer slays your dragon! (Noooo) But no worries, he may lose a few levels of experience, but he is not lost forever!- I love how epic my cities feel. In the early stages of the game things feel slow. A little humpty-Dumpty, but the pace quickly picks up. Especially when you start sieges.- Siege Battles!- The real money exchange system isn't a pay to win. They have boosts to help get your city going, but most everything else is aesthetics.- Co-OP options are awesome. When doing something that you need a little extra oomph… Go Co-Op!The Bad:- What can I say, games got bugs. While Kingdom Wars has eliminated most of the 'Show Stoppers' an occasional boot out of a battle, or a vanishing GUI can still provide headache. Even though the developers have done a great job reimbursing any lost time / effort, it's still a hassle.- Friends / Guilds / Chat system is a little clunky. Sometimes it's hard to tell when someone is online, or directly chatting with you.- I have mixed feelings about the map. Part of me wishes we could see other player cities, while another part says this is a very interesting setup. I like not being camped, people sitting outside my city waiting for protection to fall, but on the other hand. I kind of miss doing it?The Ugly:- The biggest complaint I have about the game is some of the weird, jerky movement in battle. I hate having to issue orders multiple times to get a unit to perform a special task.- Though I love Co-Op, sometimes finding someone to help you perform a task is… troublesome. Sometimes I sit for 15+ minutes looking for someone to siege with me.- The popup messages are troublesome. They ask or provide you with certain information. ""Would you like to vessel a city, or loot it for xx crowns."" If you don't answer before another message is triggered you lose both options. Being invited to a Co-Op is sometimes confusing. Yes it tells you the name or quest, but it zooms so far into the map, it's hard to tell where you really are.Overall, I would highly recommend the game. The units, city building, and unique features add a very refreshing spin on the RTS genre. The Free to play is truly free as you will not find a hidden 'Pay to win' market. The community is helpful, and the Developers are extremely repsonsive. Raise a mug to Kingdom Wars!"

,Recommended,227180,15270163,"Posted: 8 April, 2015",all,BewilderedTraveler,"An excellent game overall, that will immerse most RTS players for at least a good few hours.Its fairly simple, with a very traditional setup of the three factions with strenghts and weaknesses. such as the Humans being the most durable overall, the Elves essentially having the strongest units but with greater weaknesses, and the Orcs being oddly enough the most frail but boasting the ability to quickly amass an army of considerable size at reduced cost.(Please note: This is more of a quick run-down of some of the features in the game, than an review. The idea is that you can more effectively decide if its features appeals to you, rather than read someone trash n praise it)Leveling up your units!:This game relies quite heavily on the concept of your troops not simply being something you purchase enough of, in the right combination but actually take into skirmishes to level up or train at friendly strongholds, to then tailor suit what stats you want to improve, such as more health, damage mitigation, health regeneration, stamina, and so on.Eventually you will pretty much max out all the stats but at that point you have spend quite a lot of gold on that unit, and considering its still very likely to get inconveniently killed while you look the other way you learn to pay special heed to keeping your investments alive and well protected.Special Units:Every faction has an array of faction specific units available to them, but theres also a common pool of special units available to all the factions. These units have roots in all three main factions, but theres also units from unplayable races, such as Dragons and Dwarves. These units almost always costs you Crowns, which is a measure of wealth and influence that you can spend on recruiting considerably attractive units to attack your enemies or defend your homeland.Quest line:Theres an rather involved lore in the game, and its often very nicely attached to the characters you interact with while playing the main quest line. As you go through the main quest of your faction your tasked with defending your homeland, your kingdom, and waging war against the two other factions in the game, and often also your own.Due to the somewhat sandbox-like nature of the game, the senarios you find yourself in is often rather interesting and gradually gives you useful rewards that greatly benefit the construction of your homeland, giving a smooth progression of your homeland, the story of the game, and your involvement in the game overall.Traits and RegionsIn the MMO portion of the game, after choosing a faction you will be asked to choose a region and two traits.These are important and should be chosen to match how you prefer to play the game. If your a ""turtle"" and enjoys defensive gameplay then naturally you may want to choose the most defensive region and traits, but if your more into siege and conquest than naturally you would do well to take a region that reflects that better.Either way, your choice of region and traits will play an immense factor in the performance of your strategies.Choose wisely. :)Non-Mandatory PvPIn the online MMO portion of the game you may be attacked by enemies at any time, but you need to actually accept the battle. Should you choose not to, or let the timer run out you will forfeit a small portion of your resources as a tribute to be left alone. Even if no resources are available fighting PvP is never mandatory. As you start out with a new homeland you will have 24 hours of real time protection against PvP attacks to get you started. Notice that this time is only ticking while your in-game. Additionally, every time you pay a tribute or conclude a PvP match you will be given a small PvP Protection time.It is also possible to purchase PvP protection for Crowns.The graphics, performance, and the gameplay itself have gradually improved over time, with updates coming out frequently enough for a game you only pay for once. (Not including the micro transaction-like boosts available in the market, and additional features)The gameplay in singleplayer, whether in the online MMO world or not, is very stable but once you have an actual fight not against the AI, but another player it soon becomes a bit of a mess.(This includes co-op aswell) Reasonably playable, yes, but still very annoying at times. However, they have worked hard to improve this game and the future update expected to come out this month, which will apperantly overhaul the entire thing onto a more stable engine will hopefully bring back much of the player base and thus hopefully bring some more life back into this, in all honesty, very awesome game.(If you wish to know more details about the game, i have found a wiki with more details for you)http://strategywiki.org/wiki/Dawn_of_FantasyYes, it does have some problems now and then but this game does deserve a chance if it calls out to you in general.Regards,Brandt."

Every Unit of every Race is for every player getable without paying money.As one of the old users (i bought the game times ago) i know there is such a massive progress in debugging and improving this game - nearly unbelieveable. This process isn´t still at its end and there are still some big points of loosing enthusiasm. But i have to admit, that there is a strange element in this game, that forces me to play again and again everytime for a while and to explore the hole game.Good for me:- Business system with some tricky elements to provide my progress, like peasant armys, Vassals producing ressources,- new progress poossibilities with all the buildings .. now it´s not still all researched after 3 days .. Thats very important for me. I want to have aims in game and there are still a few, that i didn´t reached all the time. Aims of Quests or Aims of my desire- mixing and combining armys in any comination.. Great, not one skilled army for all tasks- enough possibilies to get this crones, with which you can buy anything in addition to ressources (not pay to win)- great pve battles - army vs army or amry vs castle ..- great support by nice players all around- good quest system- the possibility to go many way to win.. every unit works fine on its wise. --> Not only one way to make a strong and functioning armyDisadvantages of the game- Still since my starting its very slow in every discipline. Commands and orders have a standard delay of ca 1 sec--> this delay raises in pvp battles up to 4 sec. and graphic settings don´t change that. Because of that pvp isn´t still playable in my eyes- not answering gamesupport- not comprehensible effects of life reg on the different units.. a dragon with 50 life reg / s will not have over 10 life reg / real second. Knights instead can regenerate massive life - surely with their greater number of part-units- sometimes its dificult to find out the reason for missing the friend for an coop game.Since it is free to play i can recommend this game and minimum 10 hours that u will see a bit of the contentThis game is for you, if you like to get part by part stronger by saving up for mighty units and leveling all units and finding your own tactical way"

First and foremost, the developer has shifted focus to their next game, ""Kingdom Wars 2: Battles"" so you jumping on a ship everyone is getting off of. Secondly, this developer has in the past done complete wipes IN RELEASE state! That was when I quit.As for the game itself, it is definitely worth a play but realize you can't really play with friends like you would think for a multi-player game. The process is very convoluted, and buggy from my experience. The part that stands out is your ability to have a persistent home city you can come back to to get resources and defend from invaders. Which brings me to my next point, you can be attacked any time including while you are away. If the AI didn't suck that might be fine lol.If you are looking for something free and entertaining by all means give it a go but go into it with the above expectations and understanding.

(thanks they stole me about 500 crowns) to gain crowns you have to pay money, siege enemy cities or do pvp.

Send caravans to every corner of the world and make allies to trade with so that you can recruit and train units, or just to earn extra gold for your goods to spend on upgrading your units or for crowns to buy powerful dragons/elite units/ Dwarven helpers and more!Everything you could possibly want in an RTS has been crammed into this title.  It IS being done by an indy company so game updates come a bit slow compared to some other games, but it does not ask you to keep paying around every corner to be able to enjoy your purchase as so many games with cash shops do.***CASH SHOP CLARIFICATION*** You should really read this.This game has 'Crowns'.  Crowns are earned through questing, completing achievements, through pvp, you can buy them with gold, they can be given to you by your guild treasurer, for refering a friend or yes, you CAN purchase them.   I have owned this game for 1 month and I have 700 crowns and NO need to spend them on anything ever again and I've only spent the initial purchase price for this game.  THIS GAME IS NOT PAY TO WIN.  I have never paid a dime past the purchase price and I currently own 8 level 40 dragons and 6 elite units ALL earned from questing/pvpThis is the definition of pay-to-save-time.  Everyone is on an even playingfield here.  The cash shop is ONLY there as an option to provide extra support to the project while allowing yourself to get these units/walls/upgrades without putting in the minimal effort needed to otherwise do so.Some of the Cons:(Sorry indie game, all games got em and nobody is paying me to say otherwise :p)Graphics:Dated, to say the least.  While the assets on the map and the cities look great, the up close graphics of the units are OLD.  They look like Dungeon siege 2 units.   That said, just look at the screenshots, what are you doing so zoomed in to be staring at one unit for ANYWAY?   Well, cause a good portion of the game is talking and you are forced to see this.  Otherwise you'd never really notice it.Pathfinding:This is currently not great.  You tell units to go to a place and most of them will fairly quickly after, but it definitely leaves a lot to be desired.  That said, the free expansion coming out this month is called the 'Arcana and Pathfinding' update.  So yeah.Glitches:Every game has it's issues... this one has troubles with finding coop groups if you have attack protection on, units will get stuck in places they shouldn't be allowed to even go, you might have an instance where a resource vanishes after pvping.   That said, the staff is very quick and courteous to get back to you.  It might take a couple days to line everything up, but they are great at communication as long as you use the proper channels.No you?!Currently the games biggest flaw... Where are you?   We need more players to join in the fun!"

You need to buy crowns for 3k gold each or earn them from quests or fighting online with your armies or cities but the amount of crowns you need just to build walls is ridicullous and when you actually build them your attack protection will start to count down and then you become someones farm... income bar is bugged as hell and its critical problem when you try to play elves bcs they get everything from income... not even gonna start on units AI its pathfinding is fine but the rest is terible.

It is an interesting idea and you can tell that the developers wanted to make a game which provided many options for making an army. there are 3 types of armour and damage and all can be upgraded as well as many special abilities. However, all these good ideas are frustrated by problems with basic coding. My starter quest as the Orc Desert race broke and only completed itself days later. Many times when I have multiple unit groups selected, it won't let me select an individual one without deselecting and reselecting the group. When I'm attacking an enemy stronghold, if I target the enemy units on the wall, my units groups will just stand at the wall all around the wall. I can order the units to move onto the wall and they will. However, if I order them to move onto the wall and then to attack the units on the wall, they will move back down to the ground and stand there. I tried a few battles and the same problem happened. With such a fundamental aspect of the game being so broken I quit playing. If they fix these basic issues, I would reccommend this as a fun game.

Currently the games graphics really hurt my eyes, it's not that they are bad graphics persay for an RTS , but its very bright and gritty looking. You cannot zoom in very far and the Character models and Character textures are really bad, probly why you cannot zoom in far enough(this is on highest graphic setting, on a machine that run Skyrim, Cryisis 3, Farcry 3, TItanfall ect on Ultra/Maximum with mods).Overall: The game isn't bad and it's still evolving with the soon to be F2P version. It has alot of good ideas and alot of potential to be more than a RPG version of Evony. They do claim that the game isn't going to be pay to win, though will be able to buy immortal units with the Crowns that you can buy, plus resource boosters ect so sounds a little pay to win. IMO not worth the 5 dollars for the extras they give you, or the 3.99 on bundlestars. Feel free to give it a try when the game goes F2P, but save your 5 bucks for Batman(which is onsale for 5 bucks at the moment)."

For starters the game would not start so i went to forums to see if there was a fix for the game sure enough they had a few so i decide to take those steps which my pc specs surpass the specs they was asking for.Now for me to even get the game to work i had to wait 45 minutes while the game said  Game is not Responding, clearly there something wrong here  and so i made a discussion thread to see if i could get any help once again the developer were very helpful i don't condemn them but i do condemn their game, its unacceptable to buy a product off steam when clearly something wrong with the game, Also,  i'm tired of being a comp tech which i'm hardly qualify to do, but it seems its a common practice on steam! You buy a game expecting to play but ever so often  you run into a couple a snag that's to be expect with different pc specs, some fix are simple and some are not in my case not a simple fix  the game froze my whole pc and even harder to uninstalled that's also unacceptable, so with those problems from the start i clearly can't recommend this game due to technical issue.

(although passive greatly helps with unit control the ai needs to be better)4) a very rare glitch but when it does happen your progress and unit levels can be reseted. this is a connectivity problem though more or less in regards to the server."
76561198038512047,Recommended,227180,9303478,"Posted: 1 March, 2014",all,Lespoir,"EDIT: Revised review as of 29/09/2016.Recently decided to dig out Kingdom Wars and take another look to see if anything has changed. I can say there have been some fairly drastic changes since I first played Kingdom Wars, notably the crown store being the biggest.The crown store from what I can see is now completely gone, crowns are now used as a means of upgrading buildings and then making units that may require crowns to be made. The only benefit you can obtain from the game in a buying sense is by using ""Premium Time"" which basically gives x2 crown income (this includes quests, sieges, co-op etc - i.e quest giving 2 crowns would give 4 instead). This is quite cheap, and in honesty isn't even a necessity to enjoy the game. (The starter pack DLC's they've added are pretty good, and one even gives all the additional single player content they added in after I had stopped playing).I would also say that despite still being a small company, I contacted their CS regarding my old account and how I had lost my older progress, and despite the age of my account they still helped me get some new cities up and running, which has allowed me to play and edit this review.I would warn that there are some bugs in the game still, during sieges enemy reinforcements can literally run through your palisade wall battle camp, which can prove quite problematic, hopefully this will be getting addressed. I haven't had a chance to try Co-op just yet, once I have I will update the results, as there used to be sync problems which I believe I outlined in my original review.I would now recommend Kingdom Wars, if you can get beyond some of the annoying bugs the game itself is definitely worth trying, and it does bring something quite different and refreshing.Also, don't rely on the path finding the bit about that in my original review definitely still stands!**Original old review below - left for comparison**I played this game quite a lot when I bought it and thought it was great at first. The economy side of the game is interesting and well thought out, the unit selection is acceptable. The idea of sieging and the length sieges can take when you aren't using armies of fully levelled crown store units is also fun (we can get to that later).The game does have the potential to be really good, there's no disputing that, but please note kingdom wars is basically a name and an expansion - this game has been in development since 2011 and if you pair that with its current state, you may have some worrying thoughts of the direction the game is taking.One of the biggest gameplay flaws in this, is basically the crown store - unlike other games where your armies are limited to the amount of epic units you can have - this game isn't. You can make entire armies of the most powerful crown store units in the game, level them freely and just annihilate any city within <30 minutes to farm even more crowns. These can then be used in PVP if you wish to do so.PVP - Basically we have a strength system here - if your PVP protection is down you can be attacked by player armies that are in the current area. The system isn't well balanced, for instance you could have an army of fully levelled regular units which can then be attacked and killed by a far smaller army of one or more fully levelled crown store units - this means you can essentially lose an entire army to a few units of crown store elites.Then we go onto the bugs that I started to get plagued by, for instance each time I loaded into my cities I found my resources half wiped, when loading out from areas I'd have my resources completely wiped.The gameplay is buggy, the path finding on units is atrociously bad (they can easily get themselves killed, so you can't really command them to go one way then quickly go to manage other units elsewhere, since they'll likely get themselves killed with their own poor path finding.You can use the forums for this game for help, but help isn't really what you see there. If you look at the development logs, you see such silly developments and changes like prices of units etc - when this game has serious fundamental core game flaws, a game that calls itself an MMO, but can't even keep your data secure.They use community volunteers as mods, since they can't afford to actually employ objective people that will provide you with proper service. I think anyone reading this can agree that community volunteers should be kept to forums at most, and not given any sort of power within a game environment at all - you don't see this logic applied here.Also, something that really irks me when I was scouring the forum where the mods/devs do actively post on this game was the way they kept saying ""this rare bug"" this seemed like some sort've half hearted euphemism that i've never seen any development companies say. If you're experiencing crippling bugs, you don't want to be told it's rare and of low importance - you want to be told it's going to be dealt with asap.My view of this game is essentially - could be something amazing and it could be something different. I just think the developers are either too young, or too new to their field of expertise and this has just been a mammoth undertaking that they haven't taken up with enough maturity and focus. With some proper direction, and better management in regard to the games running, perhaps that could change.I recommend this game to anyone who has a strong chin and can put up with some of the annoyances I mentioned above in regard to the bugs, perhaps some of you can see a game that's been out there for this period of time with such core game issues and still enjoy it.For those who are looking for a casual game you can play without any issues, I don't recommend this game in the slightest."
