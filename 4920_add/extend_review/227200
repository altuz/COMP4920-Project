Waking Mars is a game about life and growth, not death and destruction.Instead of some space soldier, you play as an astrobiologist on a quest of knowledge and discovery. Along the way the game gives some educational facts about Earth and Mars as well as insight on possible interactions within an ecosystems.So if you desire games that are about growth or exploration, this contains both and should be on your wishlist or cart."
,Recommended,227200,12714464,"Posted: 31 October, 2014",all,Saere,"Platform games aren't at the top of my list - mainly because of their limited world, low replayability and (many of them) being highly linear - however, Waking Mars is one of the most enjoyable games I've been playing lately, and for me, one of the best platform games to date. Its sci-fi/ Mars setting and artwork caught my attention; but it was the goal of creating and encouraging an ecosystem within the Red Planet that sold me on it.The story is simple and straightforward, but it is intelligently executed and really intriguing. Character development is little, but just right. There are no enemies, only yourself, the 'flauna' and the environment -  but you might be surprised at just how much of a threat you can pose to yourself. The goals are laid out before you in a no-nonsense manner: you are exploring, searching, gathering, manipulating, creating, and de-constructing to create, in a more favourable way to the environment's (and your) needs. There is something to be said for balance, and you learn by trial and error; but don't worry, there is nothing that you can't undo - though it may require a measure of patience.The game mechanics are superbly fluid - the game runs without a hitch (it's enough for me to say that if I can run this on my present setup, anyone can - trust me). The time, work and research that went into this game is incredible. Overall gameplay is relaxing with adequate moments of doubt, constant wonder and dashes of uncertainty. It is a wonder to me that I do feel a sense of real isolation while playing - I think this is thanks to the beauty of the graphical style and the great music - but this is exactly what I would expect, it's the lonely and mysterious Red Planet, after all. The time it will take you to complete this game? It depends on you. I completed it (EDITED: start to finish TWICE) at the listed time played.One of the best features of this game for me was the ability to revisit any area at any time without limit. This alone makes this platformer just so non-linear. As well as being vital - you will have to travel around to resupply your seeds, revisit some areas dependant on other areas' progress, or just to re-balance an area if need be - it is a real treat to be able to return and see how the caverns have been thriving (or not) in your absence.IMPORTANT: If non-stop action, mayhem and destruction - i.e. death-n-glory - are your bread-and-butter, you will fast become bored with Waking Mars. BUT......If you enjoy platform games, I believe this is a must for your collection and many will undoubtedly enjoy it. If you are a wary platformer like me, it may blow you away and you won't regret this purchase (reg. price is reasonable; on sale price, you'd be crazy not to try it).Happily jet-packing (and occasionally bouncing) around in the ever-deepening caverns of Mars to re-awaken it... 11/10"

,Recommended,227200,32784530,Posted: 25 June,all,Mighty Pillow,"Waking Mars is a very relaxing and fulfilling experience.I didn't have high hopes for Waking Mars going in. I didn't read too much about it, but from what I gathered it looked like your dime a dozen side scrolling platformer. After starting it initially, the game crashed. That was a bummer. Restarting it worked though. Initially the voices did not work, so I thought I was going to be reading the whole game. Another restart fixed that as well. I was happy to hear that the voice acting is this game was well done and not cheesy. I then realized that there is no combat in this game. I assumed all the creepy plants in the screenshots were enemies. The entire gameplay of Waking Mars consists of literally waking mars. You are planting seeds everywhere and starting life on the planet. Some of the plants hurt you though, and there are a few hazards to avoid. I found the simplistic gameplay fun and the biomass tasks rewarding. Character movement felt a little awkward at first, but I quickly adapted to it. Most of the areas you travel in look the same, but I appreciated the environments and ecology in game. The story is engaging as well. It isn't revolutionary by any means, but it kept my interest. The ""I'm a funny robot"" cliche is kind of tired. I completed all the endings (I think). I finished in about 9 hours, and I was surprised it lasted that long. I appreciate length in games like this.I highly recommend if you enjoy a chill, not difficult game. The crashing and other bugs were annoying, but restarting seemed to fix them so I didn't mind it as much. There are no jump scares!"

But this game was compelling enough for me to keep going and actually get it 100% completed. I'll admit that it got a little frustrating / confusing towards the end and I ended up resorting to some outside guidance through steam discussions in order to figure out my next move, but I'm sure I could have eventually figured it out on my own if I had that kind of patience. The 3 endings for the game (not including the optional pre-mature exiting the cave ending) really helped keep me interested in re-loading the game to see the other endings, and of course, the other endings kept getting better and better. The voice acting was a bit weird in places though. Like the 3rd endingwhere he goes up into space,her reaction was a little anti-climactic and didn't really feel like a realistic reaction. As far as the guidance goes... the game really tries to help you out throughout the entire game, it even gives you an interface of details for each species in the game which helps a lot, unfortunately, if you forget something task related, or make a big mistake (namely the explosive seeds when you first get them and ending related areas)... it's possible to end up being stuck in the game with no clue how to progress further since you can't get the cutscenes / dialogs to repeat, so make sure to read and listen very well the first time.Overall, I really enjoyed the game. Highly recommended for those looking for something different than usual."

However, it is not really terraforming, like making habitable to human life, no, it's about ""waking"" the planet!So what it is about, then? Basically, it's a puzzle game, with explorational elements, as you go through the caverns of deep and sometimes you have branching paths; though you can return to take the other way any time. There's a story to the game and while it is simple, it is just what it needs: A set of mysteries to make you want to explore the cavern.As for the puzzle elements, that's the best part: Basically, in each chamber, you have to reach a certain level of biomass. How you do that? By planting strange animal-plants called the Zoa. Different zoa have different seeds, some just reproduce, other seeds produce water or explode. Some zoa can move and depend on seeds to reproduce. Then there are zoa that eat the moving ones. What your task is in this game basically is to kickstart a whole ecosystem! Every lifeform in the game effects the other in some way or other, making you soon create a whole jungle full of life, each depending on each other to survive and reproduce. It is just brilliant!The only two downsides I can think of, first, the artstyle, which is really not the best, the animations are quite choppy (especially on the moving zoas), and while it certainly got its own charm, I did not find it that appealing. My other problem with the game is that maybe I would have loved if there would have been maybe a little more variaties of lifeforms with a more varied roles and dependencies. I mean, don't get me wrong, there's really like a bunch of them, but I would have liked more. Maybe because I just wanted the game to last even longer. :PDefinitely a buy for those who like 2D exploration and puzzle games."

Animations and graphics were good.However, Waking Mars was lacking in something fundamental when I think of Metroidvania games. Maybe gaming skill or perhaps something more basic like keeping player engaged. You go through the process of planting seeds, deciding which plants to grow--which you are scored per area based on your choices--exploring, and collecting seeds. It's slow moving, and collecting seeds can be time consuming--even warping back to old areas, just to collect seeds for new areas, sometimes more than once per area.Watching plants through their animations can be slow growing. I suppose if you want all the achievements, be careful 5 staring each level, then moving on. You might actually miss something."

Brought to Steam Greenlight and voted by the community to be sold on steam. And the community was very right in this one.This game is much more an exploration adventure as it is a platformer, the story is dragging you in and there is allways something new to discover or to try out. Your exploration and experimentation gets rewarded. It starts of slow but gets more complex the deeper you go, unveiling the mysteries of Mars on the way.I do like the characters in the game, for some reason i can really identify with the main character, and the voice of the woman is just adorable.The main theme of the game is building ecosystems in caves. Thats what you do to generate biomass to advance in the story... Sounds dry, yes. But belive me its interresting and fun when you get involved.You also can mess it up. This game has the possibility of making and breaking the biosystems that you manage and build. Too many games have the possibility of failing completly eradicated, and thats not a good thing.The graphical style... alot of pepole seem to dislike it. For me, it simply works. And its unique and gives the game its own charme. Also, because of this it will be remembered, even in some years from now. I prefer that than cutting edge graphics with zero gameplay.Now go and buy this gem of a game and play it, its worth your time and money!"
,Not Recommended,227200,14153893,"Posted: 24 January, 2015",all,PhantomRaptor,"OverviewI have to admit I wasn't particularly hopeful that Waking Mars was going to turn out to be anything special, but at the time of writing (1.3 hours of game time) I have discovered (and if you know what the game is about, you'll realise thats a pun) that it is actually a bit of a hidden gem. It feels awesome exploring the caverns, identifying new species and figuring out what their weaknesses, diets and method of reporduction are. The drawn and animated species in the game look really awesome, and species from the same group have distinct visuals so you can tell they are related. Also, I didnt expect a game like this to have a story but it actually has quite a nice interesting one, and some of the artwork in the game is lovely.  It does, sadly get a little bit repetitive as when not discovering new species you are simply planting old ones in an attempt to beef up the biomass meter, to progress into the next area. Adding to that, due to the fact that the game is set on mars, everything looks fairly similar, red, orange and barren. While this is nice at first it starts to get a little boring, as you descend deeper into the caves it would be nice to see some different areas. Coming back to this review, I will admit I have completely lost the will to continue playing this game, it becomes very boring and repetitive over the course of the game.Positive+ Lifeforms+ The storyNegative- Repetitive- Lack of Diversity for LandscapeConclusionWaking Mars has an interesting start, and is very interesting to begin with but while I love the art style and models for the lifeforms on mars, I generally would not recommend this game."

You can fly, so there's no platforming element whatsoever). As you explore you'll encounter a number of different plant-like creatures, each with its own behaviors and method of reproduction. You have to figure out how each plant works on your own; there's not a lot of direct explanation, and this discovery aspect is the main draw of the game. Once you've got an idea of how things work, you can decide which plants to grow where in order to revive each area of the cave.The downside is that it's not all that well designed. The interactions between the lifeforms aren't very complicated, and growing the plants requires too much manual interaction, rather than organizing the environment so that it works on its own, like an ecosystem should. Still, it's worth checking out if you're interested in an experience that you haven't had before."

I recommend it for people who are looking for a non-violent exploration sci-fi experience.  The thing that makes this game unique is the core gameplay element of building ecosystems.  It basically consists of exploring cave systems and finding new forms of life.  These lifeforms are plant-like creature called Zoa which can be planted in different kinds of soil, and you acquire different seeds to do this.  Your goal is usually to raise biomass in any given area.I loved the rewarding sense of accomplishment when you've built an ecosystem that sustains itself.  Some of the areas are fairly small but there are large open cave sections where you end up building a huge, prosperous system that just keeps getting more and more dense as the different creatures within it interact with one another.  You can also encounter areas which are fairly hard to achieve a desirable sustainability.  Of course, sustainability isn't necessarily your goal in this game, but it is very satisfying when you achieve it.  There is a strong element of scientific discovery in the game but also perhaps a lesson about ecology and how our choices affect outcome.Aside from the fun of interacting with the various lifeforms, the storyline, while simple, is also very nice.  The two main characters are likeable and the resolution to the plot is pleasing.  Definitely try this out if you are looking for a different twist to the classic sidescroller."

,Recommended,227200,13682399,"Posted: 28 December, 2014",all,Viishnahn,"Waking Mars is revolutionary. If I had to give it a genre, I would call it a Dynamic Puzzle Exploration Game. It is a 2D Platformer game with a very user-friendly item management system. It has definite influences from classic Nintendo games, combining the elements of exploration, isolation and atmosphere of Metroid with growing plants and food/nutrient management of Pikmin. Anyone who enjoys either of these should take a look at this game. Anyone who likes both (like myself) will probably sit down and play the entire game in one sitting. It is a rather short game, lasting anywhere from 5-12 hours, depending on how thorough you want to be. The 17 Steam Achievements are all very easy to get on your first playthrough if you give it effort.SYNOPSIS: The basic premise of the game is this: you are an astronaut exploring a recently-discovered cave system on Mars. The only other characters are the Mars HQ woman and your environmental suit AI.ZOA: As you enter the cave system, you discover living plant-like creatures, termed ""Zoa"" by your AI. These Zoa grow from different types of seeds planted in patches of fertile soil within the caves. You can carry a number of each type of seed at a time, saving them for later use.RESEARCH: As you interact with the environment, your AI develops a research log. Once you have discovered all of the elements of a certain subject, you unlock a Steam achievement for that subject. Some of the elements are fairly straight-forward; others will take some serious thinking or random luck.BIOMASS: Each Zoa in a chamber contributes to a Biomass counter. Once different levels of Biomass are reached, certain events occur. Some include barriers opening to new parts of the map, certain Zoa waking out of dormancy, etc.SOUNDTRACK: The soundtrack is very ambient in nature and has an organic feel to it. It completes the atmospheric sense that the game presents well and does not distract from the action whatsoever.ART: This game does not have your run-of-the-mill shooter 3D render graphics, as it is only a platformer. That doesn't mean that it has the pixelated style that has been popularized of late. Waking Mars has beautifully drawn background layers that fade in and out, giving the illusion of real depth. The art team did an impressive job with very original plant-form creature design. It is a bit on the minimalist side and gives a very realistic, tangible feel to alien Mars.CONS: The only real downside to this game is the protagonist's personality. The AI is bright, happy and humorous. The HQ woman is funny at moments and believable the rest of the time. The main character is cold and sounds like he's talking in a combination of dictionary-speak and Medieval English. It is very awkward compared to the natural characters he talks to. This only really gets on your nerves during cutscenes, which you can skip (right mouse button).I picked this game up on sale, but after playing it I'd say it's definitely worth the inexpensive standard price.Final Score: 10/10"

I'm glad the guy you play as seems to have a pretty good helmet because the number of times I banged his head into the top of a cavern should have left him unconscious and bloodied in a ditch. I was using a Logitech F310 controller (in xinput mode, so it should function the same as an Xbox controller), but I had to switch to keyboard/mouse which made the game a lot more enjoyable.Waking Mars isn't perfect, but it's great for an indie game and really is a memorable gaming experience.7 out of 10, would terraform."

So I bought it hoping it would be something good and fun. And it was a correct choice, let me tell you why. The game is based on platormer gameplay where you fly around with a jet pack, you pick up various seeds and then plant organisms. These are different and there is actually a layer of research of these lifeforms which was quite interesting. Main point of almost each level is to gain most (or maximum) biomass in order to progress further. You do this while trying to balance the environment because all the different ogranisms want to kill each other. It was fun but did get very tedious and repetitive in some levels. Overall the visuals and art style are simple but pretty. You can see this looks like a flash game and it is also visible that this is a mobile game. But it's a good port and the narrative, story and gameplay are enjoyable. Also several endings are a plus (although I feel like the secret ending is a copy from Mission to Mars).

While similar games might have progress by running around and shooting the monsters, ""Waking Mars"" instead has you bring the monster to life. The various chambers have to be filled with sufficient biomass for you to progress, which you do by ""planting"" seeds (or more precisely, throwing them at various patches of fertile ground) within the caverns.Calm and relaxing, the danger - and difficulty - level is minimal and the game approaches a serene calmness that is nice change of pace. But while its non-violent take on the genre is unique, it isn't by itself enough to make an entertaining game. As I mentioned, the difficulty level is almost non-existent; despite its pretense, the Martian ecology it presents is extremely superficial and you can spam seeds to achieve victory. Or you could if you had sufficient numbers of seeds; you can only carry a handful of each and too often I had to scurry between caves looking for a specific plant to re-supply my stocks. This made the latter half of the game rather more of a grind than anything else. The lack of variety in levels is also a sore spot, and I quickly got tired of seeing the same red walls. Too frequent cut-scenes interrupted the game-flow as well. Nor were the endings - there are three of them - sufficient reward for all the effort. Kudos to the developers for trying something new, but all in all I found it a flawed game that wasn't much fun to play."

It still manages to have interesting gameplay with decent balance with progressively increasing difficulty, but what really shocked me was the storyline. With its limited cast of Liang, Amani, and the A.R.T. emoticon robot who acts and sounds like Borderlands' Claptrap, it's managed to make me care about the two human characters. The dialogue intelligently mixes hard science with the fantasy aspects and sprinkles in just a little bit of technobabble. It's compelling to play and doesn't rely on overused gaming tropes like leveling up or endless gradual equipment power progression.The gameplay is a mix of puzzle and platformer. It's also pretty original. There are few hazards you need to navigate and lots of places to restore your health. The challenge comes with properly filling each area with a sufficient amount of biomass, using the seeds you collect and the fertile ground around you.

,Recommended,227200,811603,"Posted: 29 January, 2013",all,mark | dj.,"Waking Mars is a good Metroidvania type of game. Well, that's not entirely true. You won't be using guns and you won't upgrade any gear except for your jetpack. But the level design plays like any of them anyway, and unlike the Metroidvania games it's actually split up in smaller levels instead of offering one giant world. I'm not even sure if the comparison is now justified anymore... Anyway, moving on.You've landed on Mars and your job is to discover the mysteries of the ecosystem when you become trapped in this huge cave. So you'll be picking up seeds and plant them in order to create life. Blue seeds go into the blue soil, green into the green soil, et cetera. Sounds fun, right ? It does. For a couple of hours, at least. Then it starts to feel repetitive, and it even manages to become frustrating, especially when you want to 5-star every level and your plants are eating or killing other forms of life around you, decreasing your rating.Other than creating life there are a few mini-games in the game to spice things up and to get the story going but it's nothing noteworthy to begin with.I do have to praise the developer for creating such colorful and sharp art. It looks great, but animating the cutscenes a little more would've been a good idea I think. Those parts are just too static.Soooo.... let's see. I have no idea why I finished the game in the first place so I guess it must've done something right in the end... ? I'm not sure. Check the game out and decide for yourself.[Rating: 72/100]"
,Recommended,227200,10065282,"Posted: 9 May, 2014",all,erc,"Simply put, Waking Mars is a minimalist yet highly-intelligent science fiction epic presented in videogame format.This hidden gem of a game's main strength lies in its brilliant, eco-friendly story which quickly captivates you thanks to its well-written, professionally voice-acted and belivably humane cast of characters and an all-around good pacing. While the game may broadly be classified as a metroidvania, I'd like to tag it as interactive fiction with light puzzle elements due to its taking great cares with the story-telling.The actual gameplay mechanics, on the other hand, are all linked to single idea, which is, refreshingly, to re-create life on an otherwise barren planet. With that goal in mind, you (as scientist Liang) will explore the underground caverns of the titular planet, thinking, wondering, researching, experimenting and step by step, giving life to an alien habitat by literally planting the seeds of it. Simple yet effectively executed, this planting mechanic that forms the core of the game leads to lovely self-sustained eco-systems that flourish by the touch of your hands - and with that comes a great sense of accomplishment that is like no other.The caves of Mars themselves are a joy to traverse: elaborately designed and always rich in color. The tunes that accompany you throughout your adventure perfectly capture the mood of any given scene, never taking the forefront yet always enhancing the experience. The controls are fluid and easy to get a hold of, never detracting from the experience. In short, the game is flawless in its audio / visual departments and devoid of technical faults.All in all, a ten-hour science-fiction adventure with unique promises on all fronts that you'll be remembering fondly for a long time and that is as effective as any thought-provoking work of art in the said genre."

,Recommended,227200,29291825,Posted: 16 January,all,arcanum.zero,"Waking Mars is a unique take on the Metroidvania concept.  You play a trapped scientist exploring an subterranean Martian ecosystem, and the only way to survive is to learn how the mysterious organisms coexist and manipulate those relationships to progress through the cave.You have no weapons, tools, or keys, except for the seeds of the creatures that surround you, and each room requires a different combination of organisms, planted in fertile soil, to survive the unique conditions there and open the way deeper into Mars' crust.  It is not a fast-paced experience, but it is rewarding.It is easy to recommend this game, but it is harder to decide to whom the game is best recommended.  It's nominally an action platformer, but both the action and the platforms are in short supply.  I think it's a management game more than anything else.  You have a supply of seeds, and a series of challenges to overcome with that inventory.  Some rooms will produce surplus seeds for you; others will require seeds from elsewhere to be completed.Then you get your hands on the self-propagating pH-altering spores and things get a little frantic while you try to meet your goals without your carefully balanced rooms disintegrating.The story is well written and the voice acting is excellent.  The characters are skillfully realized.  The graphics are pretty, for sprites, and the music is good.  The gameplay has some rough edges, but nothing worth a thumbs down.  Mostly you will get information about new species that you don't think you've earned, and whenever a cutscene gets triggered you lose control of your character.  I never got dumped into magma or similar danger, but I think it could happen.  Fortunately the penalty for death is essentially nonexistent thanks to a robust autosave system.If you're into management and puzzles, this one is worth checking out.  It's not really for action platformer fans, though, unless you are interested in seeing the concept dramatically deconstructed."

The game offers a well written back story for any story driven gamer; including a well rounded character, and few supporting character.However, the gameplay fell a bit short. There are only a handful of different seeds available, and you're only allowed to carry a limited quantity at a time; for that reason, you'll constantly find yourself back in the same room replenishing your seeds. Had the game allows you to instantly replenish your seeds or simply making your seeds supply infinite, rather than making you slowly waiting at each individual plants, then this experience wouldn't be so bad to bear. On top of that, the game revolves around increasing biomass, which often pushes the player to plant those high value seeds rather than a variety of them. Adding that to the limited seed supply and you got a very repetitive game.In summery, if a rich story is enough to carry you through the game, then be sure to pick this game up.

I was wrong though. The gameplay is easy to understand and the game is sincere in it's core. It wants the player to have a sense of discovery and exploration of an alien world in a different planet. And it works.The game is mostly simulation mixed with platforming. You investigate elements/creatures and their behaviors. Then you manipulate them to serve you and make the environment thriwe by making the elements relate with each other.The game has metroidvania type elements where you are granted new tools to fix old areas and you are required to do purposeful work with the tools. You get to know the areas well. You are having some part in creating your own experience in the game and the game not forcing you to progress linearly.There are certain parts though where the next steps aren't obvious and can cause some frustration. These were relatively short lived though and not really a big thing. I actually enjoyed it because it made me more attached to the puzzles the game had to offer and got to know the mechanics better.Only negative parts for me were:* Collision detection--> Got stuck in ground once but just once* Too much effort into making your robot companion ART funny--> The game is self aware of it being tedious though* Visuals look like cut & pasted jpegs--> However the use of assets were good and created memorable events and rooms with the assets even though the style wasn't really up there with the rest of the game* Achievement unlocking--> I had troubles getting 0CT0 achievement even though I had gotten the upgrade from itOverall I enjoyed what the game had to offer and was impressed how the game used it's mechanics and visual design.

Overall, it was an enjoyable game, and I recommend it to anyone who wants a casual exploration game that they can sit back, relax and enjoy (it has controller support).Oh, and it's worth mentioning that the developer is/was active on several different forums, answering players' questions and helping them to get past parts of the game if they needed it, as well as fixing players' save files if bugs occurred (before they were patched).

You have the scientific method, and that's about it. You're given a journal, basic jetpack controls, and let out to play around on the inner caves of Mars. Seeds will spawn plants alarmingly quickly, and you record the attributes of the various animals and plants while balancing the populations in order to reach a ""life force"" cap to go to the next bit. It's a nice idea but after only like 5 plants it slows to a crawl as they drastically increase the cap necessitating hours of repetitive violent gardening.

It is nearly perfect for when I just want to kill some time, but not with mindless garbage. The sci-fi is light but very well-executed, the gameplay is relatively easy but not overly simplistic, and I'd guess that the whole thing is likely to be quite pleasant for you, if my description sounds enticing in any way.It is also worth noting the similarities and contrasts to the equally excellent sci-fi platformer, 'The Swapper'. 'Waking Mars' requires less commitment, has less difficult gameplay, and a more transparent and readily exposed storyline and mission; 'The Swapper' has significantly tricky puzzler and gameplay aspects, a more subtle and evasive script, and requires a lot more patience. Upsides and downsides to both, depending on what you are looking for."

Pretentions, artsy, making no sense, and of course multiplatform (and with graphics which helps run it on every ♥♥♥♥ing Apple hardware ever created). After some time, it grew on me to the point, where i dont give a crap and can rip Waking Mars (and similar titles) a new one without thinking about how stupid the entire premise is. Oh well.

Its really stupid, and makes no sense, but this ""mystery"" will probably be the olny thing, which is interesting. Ish.Gameplay is really basic, dare i say, designed to play on mobile devices. And it shows pretty much. We are flying around, throwing stuff and sometimes makes some really simple dodging. Puzzle game 101.

Sure its graphics are far from impressive, but that's not what they were aiming for.Now I'll start with what I enjoyed the most of this. The soundtrack. The music is so strange and unique, so it fits this alien world perfectly. But, truly, many of the tunes are just great tunes! You can check it out in the DLC, its free!What I'll remember most profoundly about this game is how unique it was. Its system is unlike any other game out there. Sure, it borrows a few generic concepts from Metroid, so yeah, its a Metroidvania game (but those are awesome!). But it differs in that theres no combat in the usual sense, no weapons, no direct attacking. Rather, you throw seeds around and grow different plants that have unique abilities, to suit your needs. Got hurt from acid or nasty plants? Grow a healing plant. Want to water a dry area to grow more plants? Grow a water plant. Then theres more unusual situations of having to grow predatorial plants to eat the ""enemies""... but I digress.Another unique thing is that there is no enemies, nor antagonist for that matter. Sure, the wildlife you encounter might attack you, but only if you invade their territory or get too close for comfort. They just mind their own business, being generally neutral, like the wild in real life. Its nice not to have stupid cliched ""bad guys"", and it just works!Its all about the exploration. This game is surprisingly deep and you'll have much to discover, everytime adding a new entry in a nifty little encyclopedia (like a Pokedex), giving you hints on how to interact with things in interesting ways. The game is very smart in how it always manages to surprise you. It presents you with a new lifeform, and you just gotta... experiment with it. Its really fun and I'm not gonna spoil any details.If theres one thing that it fails at, sadly, is replayability. Its very long and tedious at times, but it was worth it to see what happens next. If you already know what next, however, theres very little incentive to go through the hoops a second time.  I'd replay it in a heartbeat with a friend though, to showcase it!All in all, I REALLY recommend this game and strongly encourage game developpers to take a gander at it, this hidden gem of originality."

And yet Tiger Style went above and beyond to make the game a standard-setting platformer on its own merits.This is yet another mobile game that doesn't feel at all like a mobile game. The controls are tight and smooth. The art assets are gorgeous, including the face close-ups which accompany all the dialogue. The voice actors are engaged and well-directed.Much has been made of the Metroid roots of the title. The chatty trio of protagonists somehow feel more alone on Mars than silent Samus did on Zebes. Tasks must be completed and resources collected in order to press forward. Paths branch and reconnect, many of them essentially optional. Still, Waking Mars feels like its own game rather than a derivative. The primary mechanic of the game - using alien seeds to establish life in the depths of a cave slowly waking from centuries of slumber - is novel and intuitively implemented. Waking Mars is no reskinned shooter.What most impressed me was the way the curtain was lifted on the final element of revelation. To some extent the game suffers from tutorial syndrome as your helpful companions chatter along; they always seem to be one step behind your own grasp of what you need to do. But the understanding of just what might really be going on under the regolith is something the game lets you deliciously realize on your own. This quiet revelation is well-paced with just the right hints along the way. The game is short, but it's full nonetheless and ends exactly where it should.

It cannot be described otherwise.I found it on sale at a ridiculous price, and decided to give it a try as I was attracted by the premise of a game about ""mastering an ecosystem"", and by the reviews talking about quality narration and voice acting. This totally exceeded my expectations.Not only is this game a quite challenging and extremely enjoyable puzzle/explorer, with a set of original mechanics unlike anything I had ever played, but Waking Mars is a little masterpiece of science fiction. The way the developers struggled to create a set of ""rules"" according to which the wierd and colorful martian ""plant fauna"" functions and thrives, and yet managed to render it - if not entirely likely - at least scientifically plausible, is really something remarkable, and really shows passion and effort - and some good degree of competence in the matter. Story-wise, it's pretty simple and complete within itself, as a good short story should be. A great idea to begin with, that has been chiseled, polished and refined - a gem, as I said. The characters are among the most real and human I've ever found in a game, even if they're just a couple of static drawn faces talking through the radio - and in addition, the voice acting is tremendous. Especially considering this is an indie game.Something I really enjoyed about the story is that there's not something like an immediate danger, or an impending problem that has to be resolved before-it's-too-late. The only part in which you are in some kind of trouble, the only one part in which you are trapped within these caves and have to get out somehow, is not at all pivotal and actually ends before mid-game. After that, what's left to keep you going is just the fact that you're goddamn curious. Both yourself, and your asian astronaut counterpart. The things you discover while venturing deeper and deeper inside this huge network of caves as ancient as the solar system, while making it flourish with life, are bound to keep you stuck with this game until everything is made clear. The kind of curiosity, suspence, and marvel that I experienced while playing through the game are the same that I'd feel while reading a well-written novel.In conclusion: this game is great. The gameplay is original and satisfying, and the setting, narration and atmosphere are terrific. And the price is ridiculous. If you like Clarke-tier hard science fiction, you'll love this. Buy it."

It starts out pretty strong, there's a solid story throughout, the visuals are decent, the planting mechanics seem pretty interesting. For the first three chapters the game is quite linear, and the fourth (and longest chapter) opens up a little though I would never say it's that exploration-heavy, or much of a metroidvania.But the game really starts to drag around chapter 4, with increasingly tedious work needing to be done to hit 4 and 5 level biomasses for the rooms. Thankfully there's an event that doubles the effectiveness of these right near the end, so if you hit 30 you're basically done. But it still takes a lot of work and some of the rooms can be really tedious and frustrating, the AI on the moving lifeforms is not very good.There's also a number of glitches, stuff getting stuck in walls etc. but also game-breaking bugs that can ruin your file; thankfully I did not encounter this but I did get a kind of buggy ending the first time via skipping a large chunk of the endgame sequence by having enough core power to trigger the normal ending.

It's a good way to waste a few days' time. I was surprised to find out there are basically three endings. The fact I apparently finished it before solving one of the major end puzzles gave the game some measure of replayability as I used my previous end save game to complete the bonus puzzle and unlock the two other endings.In later gameplay, though, one thing really started to bother me, and that was the fact that biodiversity simply didn't work. Instead of a circle of life, you'd have lifeforms destroying each other, taking over each other's growing spot and actually decreasing the total biomass. And since the only real goal, especially in the game's end-phase, is to maximize biomass, you'll generally end up replacing every single plant-lifeform in the whole cave system with the one that gives the most biomass, is harmless to you and the other lifeforms, and on top of that, acts as food production for all of the mobile lifeforms.As far as I can see, there is no way to make a self-regulating system which involves all of the life in the ecosystem, so yeah, that is a bit of a failure, in my opinion.This entire rant, however, just shows how engrossed I became in experimenting with the whole concept.

If the idea of a less-dark, non-combat Metroid sounds interesting, you might want to check this out.  If you're by any chance a fan of ""Rendezvous with Rama"", by Arthur C. Clarke, I expect you'll enjoy this; there's some conceptual overlap.In any case, I liked it.  It's a neat little game.  It has the distinction of being the only game on Steam for which I have completed all achievements, which I'm pretty sure I didn't do on purpose. =]"

I feel a bit like a babysitter when being in the room and trying to make everything not kill themselves. Very interesting story, too. I grew attached to the characters over the course of the game."

,Recommended,227200,31589287,Posted: 6 May,all,Jeddi151,"Waking Mars is a fun puzzle game.  The description tries to sell it as a platform game, but I would not call it a platformer.  You have a jetpack with infinite fuel.  So you fly around, with no real danger to yourself.The goal is to grow the ecosystem in each area of a cave.  As the ecosystem grows, you unlock more rooms.  Some rooms have new types of plants or creatures, so as you move forward in the game, the ecosystem changes slightly, but with the same goal.  Grow Plants, and Unlock More Caves.With basic gameplay, the story is actually what pushes this game over the edge.  As you move forward into the cave you learn more and more about the cave itself, and it runs into a great Sci-Fi story.  Nothing groundbreaking, but just a nice story.Achievement Quest - This is an easy 100%.  Most achievements are based upon learning about the different plants in the game.  If you can't seem to find research about a plant, a quick google search will find what you are missing.   Also, getting the largest ecosystem in each are is important, as it will unlock other achievements later."

It's intellectually stimulating, nonlinear, nonviolent, and rewarding.The game has you traveling between chambers and establishing interactive ecosystems while negotiating emergent behaviours. Trying to raise the combined biomass of all your creatures is a delicate balancing act that has you weigh the utility of a given plant against its adverse or beneficial effects on the microcosmic chamber ecosystem. The challenges can be tackled nonlinearly, and while they can be cheesed—by taking resources from other chambers—the satisfaction of establishing a self-sustaining and propagating food web and growth pattern is pretty damn great.The visuals are bright and fantastic, with it's parallax-heavy and vaguely paper-like aesthetic giving the whole experience a much cheerier tone than you'd expect from 'trapped underground on mars by yourself.'The story is inspiring, if a bit slow. The AI companion is absolutely hilarious. It's a good way to spend an afternoon (or more, if you're interested in getting the special ending)."

I would have preferred it if the chambers had more of a challenging puzzle aspect to them, but the game achieved what it set out to do and I really enjoyed it."

It's much more about exploration and, in a weird way, crafting the world around you (rather than crafting tools you carry with you)."
,Recommended,227200,35029076,Posted: 17 September,all,luff-MEISTER,Fun and suspenseful. Skillful level design and a decent feeling of exploration and discovery.
,Recommended,227200,35196227,Posted: 24 September,all,Atomic Element Zero,"This one was quite enjoyable.  It's somewhat like a resource management game.  One I discovered the ""Travel"" option in the map, it became significantly easier to get stuff done.The game certainly got more challenging with the introduction of the spores, which continuously kill your plants and change them to other things.  That made it a bit of a race against the clock to protect your plants and try to prosper."
