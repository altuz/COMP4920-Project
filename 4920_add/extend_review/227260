In my case, really loving it!PS. This is NOT for gaming!!! It is for multitasking with many display monitors or TV!If you do seek multimonitors for gaming, you'll have to seek either AMD Eyefinity Technology or 3D Vision Surround Technology... and you better have an OBESE WALLET!"
,Recommended,227260,12180269,"Posted: 21 September, 2014",all,✪ Maniac ✪,"This is one of my favourite and personal must-haves within software. It's one of the most useful pieces of software for general desktop use, and definitely one of the very best applications on Steam.What does DisplayFusion do, you ask? It gives you the ability to put an individual Windows Taskbar on any monitor you'd like, aswell as let you have different wallpapers for your different monitors with relative ease.It lets you pin individual programs to whichever taskbar you'd like. I've got Steam, Firefox, Chrome & Pathfinder on my main, and GeForce Experience, MusicBee, Mumble, Nexus Mod Manager and Nvidia Control Panel on my secondary.  Customising and optimising your workspace is as easy as can be with this neat lil' program.You can also create profiles for wallpapers and the like, and have your main monitor change wallpaper every 5 minutes and 13 seconds, whilst your secondary changes every 13 minutes and 37 seconds, it really doesn't matter what you want from this software - It's up to the task.Ofcourse the wallpaper settings let you pick whichever folder or website you'd like to pull the changing wallpapers from. DeviantArt page? No problem. A wallpaper site? No problem. Your Portal-wallpaper folder on one, and your Half-Life wallpaper folder on the other? No problem at all. Scaling the wallpaper? No problem at all! Do you want to re-align it horizontally and vertically? Easy peasy lemon squeezy.Customising your taskbars and desktop environments has never been this smooth, easy & fast - Sounds like PR jargon, doesn't it?, but it's the truth. I rarely recommend any sort of paid-application, however this is one that I can't help but recommend. The Steam-Pro version is the best there is, and it's incredibly cheap for what you get. This is one of just three programs I've EVER paid for, and damn if it wasn't worth every penny."

Rather than beat around the bush, let me get straight to the thing that I'm sure you're wondering about: this is a great alternative to UltraMon.  It's got all the important features: independent monitor wallpaper, multi-monitor ""smart"" taskbars, ""send to other monitor"" buttons added to windows, hotkeys for common multiple monitor tasks, and so on.  It even has a few new features I wasn't expecting, like background overrides for the login screen.Configuration is pretty easy and has mostly what you would expect, along with some nice bonuses.  There's even an override function to control how DisplayFusion interacts with certain pieces of software.  I would have been happy with a simple blacklist, but this actually lets you disable or enable specific features for each program, disable features globally when certain programs are running, or if necessary stop DF from hooking into the process entirely.  It's a LOT of configuration options, and is definitely appreciated given how finickey some other software can be.Visually, DisplayFusion is seamless for most applications.  The add-on taskbar looks and behaves exactly like the standard Windows taskbar.  Added buttons on the title bar (if enabled) look at home next to the normal Windows ones, but are offset enough that you won't snag them with a stray click. There are a few applications where the new buttons show up dramatically out of place - Steam being one of them - but that's what the override feature is for.   Mostly, DF does a good job of knowing when to be present and when not.For the price I paid for DisplayFusion (it was on sale) I am very happy.  I'm already getting a good amount of use out of the program, and with the promise of lifetime updates this is a purchase I won't be regretting."

I put this in caps as I think alot of gamers are buying it for this feature. Essentially this feature allows you to manipulate other monitors to check email, watch youtube, etc without minimizing your game by alt-tabbing. An awesome feature, when it works. After doing alot of research this appears to be a simple hook command that doesn't work with every game and their appears to be nothing they can do about it based on their forum responses. On the majority of games I tested I couldn't get the feature to work, however it did function on a few titles so you really need to test and see if it works for you.IF YOU ARE BUYING THIS SOFTWARE FOR ITS OTHER FEATURES HOWEVER then I think its a great buy, personally multi-taskbars, separate wallpapers per display, etc don't really matter to me, at least its not a feature I would pay for. Again if this is your reason then I reccommend this software. I left a negative review as the main feature gamers would like I believe and the ultimate reason I purchased the software didn't function well for me, but if anything I think this shows more than ever how much steam needs a neutral rating option."

Have a work desktop icon layout that you can switch to a personal desktop layout with the input of a keypress combination of your choice.My initial reason for purchasing this product was to make it easy to switch between 3 monitors (2 desktop computer monitors (non-1080p), and one 1080p TV). I tried a ton of things and I simply could not make switching things to my TV for Big Picture Mode easy.Icons do not get rearranged when switching anything around the desktop icon layout save/load is for when applications don't play nice with your OS and move things around due to resolution switching/stretching problems.This made it take 3 mouseclicks.

I first started off with a Windows 7 computer and I did not like the multi-monitor support within the base OS. So I downloaded the free version of this software and was it very helpful and made it easier to manage your multi-monitor setup. Then I updated to Windows 8 and Microsoft did start implementing support and easier management for multi-monitor setups but it is not as advanced as this. So now I am here back on Windows 7 now using the full version of this software and I honestly love it. This software is a must have for anyone using 2 or more monitors on Windows 7 or earlier.

Please check out the huge number of new additions since my original review; this is so much more than it was... and it was a LOT back then!!!------------------OLD REVIEW:Totally worth it.+ DisplayFusion makes working with multiple monitors and multiple configurations a breeze, whether you just want to manage multiple displays or set specific wallpaper configurations, or confine your mouse cursor to a specific region of a specific monitor, or to a specific window or a specific monitor or virtual monitor you've defined.+ Can completely take over handling screensavers and wallpaper changes. Set what you want and be happy with your Windows configuration.+ You can use the Windows key as part of your Ctrl+Shift+Alt+etc. hotkey definitions, something most software doesn't allow, so you have even more available!+ Does it annoy you when you're playing a game and the taskbar or another window moves to the top (front) and messes you up by covering your game or stealing the input? This'll fix that for you. Annoyed by having your mouse cursor leave the screen and go to another screen when you're trying to do something precise? That annoyance is easy to avoid with DisplayFusion! How about when the topmost window freezes or you can't access the OS? Use a DisplayFusion-managed taskbar on another monitor (or the first) to manipulate your GUI in any way you like. Set your favorite features/scripts/etc. to run using an icon on the titlebar of the window. I can't enumerate in one review the number of features or the huge potential this software has for improving your productivity and the usability of your PC.+ The developers are very friendly and helpful and open to suggestions for new features and ideas to implement in upcoming versions—this sofware is updated frequently and the developers are very active when it comes to solving problems, fixing bugs, writing scripts (if you're not up to scripting monitor/UI/window changes yourself), or just telling you how a feature works if it seems to work strangely on your Windows PC's hardware.Please read the full description of features on the Store page or the website, since I probably missed a lot of what's great about this software. I also might have included a lot of information here that is already listed, or maybe what I've typed is different, because I wrote about the features that came to my mind first.Negatives.... hmm... I don't know.If it seems to be taking a lot of RAM or resources, you can go into the advanced configuration and turn on ""run using idle priority"" (paraphrased) and (whichever option tells it to clean up its RAM caches more frequently/use less RAM). Personally, I noticed no decrease in performance when I turned on those configuration options (when I had half as much RAM as I now have), yet they resulted in more RAM and CPU available for other processes. Depending upon how pedantic you are and how your box is configured, you might notice different results. Use what works best for you!My pithy review can't do it justice, so I suggest you check out the website and forums and all the reviews if you are not sure about this great software."

This program lets me switch to have different resolutions quickly (when split), change which is the master/slave, etc - not to mention what program/apps go to which monitor by default, etc.  All at the click of a button!I'll likely be adding another monitor soon for my hobbyist music recording as well (y'know, when you got your tracks on one side, and your mixer on another), which is gonna require a whole different monitor profile setup. =)Multiple monitors can really help the workflow for about any gig or hobby, I think, and this program will really make your life that much easier.

I've owned a couple business laptops over the years that used Nvidia's nView desktop management software (which is only available for their workstation-type Quadro cards, unfortunately), and this is definitely a good substitute. It's a bit less polished than nView, but that's to be expected when you're comparing it to workstation utlities. It fixed the biggest problem I had with multiple monitors, which was simply getting programs to always start up on the active monitor.Now, why I actually need an additional piece of software in order to make this happen is beyond me. You'd think someone at Microsoft would've noticed by now that new windows almost always open on whatever particular monitor would be least useful for them to open on.^^^^  If anyone wants to mention how annoying this is to someone at Microsoft so they can fix it, I would much appreciate it, and while you're at it, let them know that whenever I click ""End Process"", the computer does the exact opposite, almost every single time.I feel like I'm under a lot of pressure to write a fair, objective, and highly informative review, based on the facts of my user experience... it probably would've been easier if I had just typed ""10/10 - would buy another monitor again"", or something stupid like that, rather than actually trying to tell you why I like this software.Display Fusion does a lot of other great stuff too, and a more dedicated reviewer would take the time to tell you, dear reader, about all of it. Don't give up; you may yet find the work of such a dedicated reviewer. The last paragraph of this review will not provide an new information and is essentially a rewording of the first paragraph of this review.Don't let the comparison to nView deter you - this is a little less polished but it probably does more overall, if you take the time to customize it. Best software of its type that doesn't require a workstation card, as far as I know. A lot of the functionality feels like it should be a component of the OS itself, in my opinion."

Anyone that uses multiple monitors with varying resolutions might want to look at this application - it's very well thought-out.  One of the best features is that I no longer have an ""invisible wall"" when moving my mouse between my 4k monitor and my 1080p monitor."

I'm happy I did, because I would've had to change my review to reflect all the awesome changes the developers have enabled for this software since then. I'm so entirely happy I installed this, especially being an extreme advocate of triple monitors. I've put this software through trails in processing and it has held up every time. It has only ever crashed due to a conflict with a screensaver that I uninstalled out of disinterest anyways.Thusfar I believe this is the highest score I have given to anything, but it is well earned. This software was polished on windows 8.1, but then I'm using it on windows 10, and the developers diddn't suddenly invent a new product like other software I know *Cough* Start8 *Cough*, they stuck with the change and that says a lot about a developer!

Nvidia Surround and AMD Eyefinity essentially tell Windows and other programs that the 3 monitors form a single screen; while this is a basis for displaying an image of a game on all 3 screens at the same time, this also means that if you want, like me, to display a different wallpaper on each monitor, you can't with Windows (or you can if you create the wallpaper in PS by pasting each wallpaper next to each other). DisplayFusion can ""cut"" the desktop area into any kind of shape; my 5760*1080 area has been cut into three separate 1920*1080 areas, each displaying a random wallpaper from a folder, rotating every 5 minutes. Simply magic. Add to this the task bar controls, the triggers, and you simply have a must have software."

I have two monitors which I prefer to have a picture on normally, then when I play a game I want the other monitor all black. You might say ""why not turn it off?"" Well, the first reason is Windows is an idiot and handles it badly, it's like object permanence in babies, the other is the beautiful expensive 4k monitor doesn't have a power button. It might be in a menu somewhere...Anyway. If you find a feature you need, the rest of the software is stable and hasn't screwed anything else up for me.
