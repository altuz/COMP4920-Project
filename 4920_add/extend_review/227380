,Recommended,227380,7438921,"Posted: 20 October, 2013",all,Brian Reynolds,"In a nutshell: this release of Dragon's Lair is as perfect a version of the original laserdisc game from 1983 as you're likely ever to need, for better or worse.Here's some longer thoughts on the game...For anyone old enough to have frequented arcades in 1983 you'll undoubtedly remember the stir Dragon's Lair caused when it was released.  I vividly recall seeing the local game with a second television monitor mounted atop the cabinet so that the crowds of people standing around could still see the game playing even from a distance, and when *anybody* made it to the end to face off with the dragon there's was a clamor of excitement.  That was 30 years ago.  Video games were so primitve back then that not only were characters limited in visual appeal and animation but gameplay too was barely more than a joystick moving in 4 directions and tapping a button.  In that context Dragon's Lair soared above the rest with its genuine cartoon animation and even the stilted mash-buttons-and-learn-patterns gameplay wasn't too off putting.In 2013 however Dragon's Lair has little to offer anyone who didn't fall in love with the game back then.  The gameplay is only slightly more compelling than hitting the fast forward and skip buttons on your DVD player, and there's grade school fan fiction of King Arthur that's deeper than the plot put in motion here.  The animation is very competent and Princess Daphne is a riot of laughter with her breathless exclamations and anatomy that should be poking holes in her costume.  Thankfully there are options to make the game easier to play from on-screen prompts to just watching all the sequences play automatically... a much appreciated choice because it gets really tedious playing some sequences over and over because the timing isn't split-second accurate.  There are ""achievements"" for playing the game in arcade hard mode (no audio or visual prompts) but that's strictly for the masochistic.For the life of me I can't understand why the video files aren't in 1080p HD quality... it's 720p instead which makes me wonder if there's going to be yet another release somewhere down the line.  I also would have liked to get a proper freeze frame mode in order to do animation analysis, and for some reason I wasn't able to take any screengrabs while playing.  Very odd.But, I did pay money for this and I definitely feel like I enjoyed my purchase."

It's nothing but quick time events, so you're not really controlling where he goes, meaning no exploration2. This was originally an arcade game, so you can beat the game in half an hour3. There are different difficulties and the original arcade mode to play, so it has replayability.Don't buy the game if you want a long game to fill your time.Buy the game if you want a quick thing to play, and enjoy classic animations and arcade games"

In the era of Pac-Man and Donkey Kong, a video game cartoon was amazing to my young eyes. Nostalgia and a Steam sale compelled me to purchase the game and relive my childhood.I enjoyed it for a bit. The game play is simple and sometimes frustrating, but that is how the classic game is played. Unfortunately, I don't consider this edition the definitive version of Dragon's Lair. I say this for several reasons:- Scenes do not seem remastered, unless they mean...- Animation is zoomed & cropped for widescreen (my biggest criticism).- It may run in 720p, but the picture quality looks like an old VHS tape.- No native controller support or custom key bindings.- Doesn't work in Big Screen Mode- Imprecise button response for a game that requires precise input.- Simplistic user interface. Limited Options.Never-the-less, Dragon's Lair has a special place in my gamer heart and I am not unhappy to have it in Steam. I just wish it was a better version."

When I purchased Dragon's Lair, I thought it was HD remake, which perhaps provided extended gameplay or extra content, a fully fleshed out experience, based on the old 1980s Arcade game; but this is not the case, it is as advertised: the 1980s Arcade game.So, I just wanted to throw that out there in case anyone was wondering. Now, to the game. It's kind of fun, though a little repetative. The game design is essentially based around memorising a path to the princess, and getting timings just right (press Left/Right/Up/Down at precise moments or you die and restart at a checkpoint). This, back in the 80s, I'm sure was a genius idea for getting tonnes of quarters out of kids playing the Arcade machine, but as a game I don't need to plug money in to continue, it's just a little droll.I would recommend this game if you're looking for nostalgia. Maybe you played the game back in the day and never saw the end of it, or you were a Dragon's Lair champion and wanna relive your glory, you'll love it. But, if you're looking for a challenging and engaging title, with a story and interesting/creative gameplay, I would not recommend it.Nilesy"

This is the game that turned me from a pinball wizard into a RPG/ video game junkie. I even own the PC release they made way back before Steam even existed.  Simple enough game, unfortunately no joystick control.  A joystick would make this game easier in my opinion.  Controls are right, left, up, down, and space bar for sword (which was a button on the arcade console).  Seems easy, but it is not.  The gamer has to pay attention to the cues on when and in which direction to move then do so on time.  From years of playing here is a hint: the scenes play first either to the right or left then in the opposite direction later in the game.  It can seem tedious I suppose, but I guess that is half the fun.  Really can you go the distance, all the way to the dragon's lair without losing track of which side (right or left) one played or losing all your lives.  Also if I remember correctly the Black Knight and the Lizard King are basically bosses somewhere about a third and three fourths of the way through the game. For me this is an absolutely must own game and I wish I had found it sooner on Steam.Best features for me in this game: is instant replay from where one left off without inserting more quarters and a full playthrough without interaction (like watching a movie)."

Many of us fell in love with the game and a new challenge was present in our community arcade... to beat the dragon and save the princess. I dumped way too many quarter's into this game and came back late from lunch on more than one occassion. The owner of the arcade had installed a monitor above the machine so others could watch while you played. In time I had developed quite a few followers that I think figured I was most likely to complete the game. Some would even let me play ahead of them even though they had their quarters lined up. A couple of times other people even paid for me to play the game. One afternoon, it finally happened. Amidst a small crowd of people surrounding the machine I reached the Dragon's Lair. Of course I didn't beat it the first time, but I played again and much to the enjoyment of the crowd, I defeated the dragon and we all saw the end of the game. I was very proud to have been the first person in our city to have defeated the game.The next challenge of course was to defeat the game without dying. This challenge did not take very long at all.Of course, seeing the game on Steam meant I must purchase it for nostalgia's sake. Playing through it was not too difficult and for the most part I had no problem with the control response (I was surprised how many moves I remembered from all those years ago). I actually found the graphics to be very decent for this version.Their are two versions of the game, Arcade and Home. I've played the Arcade version but have not tried the Home version uet. There are also two difficulty settings; Easy and Hard. I think on Hard the timing of your moves just has to be more precise and easy is a little more forgiving on pressing keys at the wrong time. You can also turn the moves indicators on or off (move indicators are not the flashes that are built into the animation but arrows and a sword icon that appear when it is time to press a button), You can also turn the move accepted sound indicator on or off. So if you really want a challenge, put it on Hard, turn the move indicators off and turn the move accepted sound off and try and complete the game without dying. :)The game is all QTE (but it was the only way we were ever going to play an animated game 30 years ago.There is also a mode where you can just watch the game all the way through just like watching a Saturday morning cartoon.If you're a fan of cartoons or nostalgic for the game than I would say it is definitely worth the purchase. I know it was for me."

Since then, the demand for better graphics and sounds has exponentially increase from year to year. Now (then) at 1983, we witness a game that can rival any animation screening with both quality sounds and graphics. This game, Dragon’s Lair is a marvel to behold as it shows us how far video gaming has gone in its short history (using the baseline of 1977). As much the game is a total mind blowing exercise, the core gameplay is where it fell down as it’s a lot better viewing the game than actually playing it. However someone has to play it to view it – quite ironic to say the least.Dragon’s Lair can be completed within about thirty minutes or so. Once completed its game over however there’s a good chance that you’ll be playing the same sequence more than once during a play through. I remember going through that elevator stage three times and visited the rapids twice in one play through. Yet, as mentioned before, it’s a game where it is best viewed (like an animated flick) as opposed to playing it. However someone has to play it so we can view its glory. Also the QTE takes away from viewing the game as you will be concentrating more on what symbol comes up next, unless you memorised all the events. That said, it’s a victim of its own success as great visuals comes with a great loss; and that loss is gameplay. Still it’s a terrific game nevertheless thanks to the laserdisc technology.Full review:http://www.gamespot.com/dragons-lair-1980s/user-reviews/2200-12697053/8 / 10"
76561198128371609,Recommended,227380,31758498,Posted: 14 May,all,Emuser,"Dragon's Lair is a well known game glorified into what we would call a quick time event simulation.  It appeals to nostalgia thanks to the animation style and it's fame.  While I do recommend this game, there are a few precautions to point out.Understand that this is literally QTE: The Video Game.  This isn't a bad thing pointing this out, as the animation is humorous as well as the various ways Dirk can fail.  You can literally watch the game on Youtube, and it is not long at all once you know the button inputs for each sequence (12 minutes or so).  There is no controller support, so you are stuck to using your keyboard arrow keys and spacebar.  This isn't honestly that bad, but one cannot try to use an arcade stick to relive the feeling of using that kind of controller if they wished.  Despite the 720HD upscaling, it is dated looking but I am not surprised given the age of the animation.  I understood what I was buying, and I bought this and Dragons Lair II at $4.99 each.  I knew exactly what I was buying as well, so I have no regrets about this purchase.Dragon's Lair has been released on tons of platforms, but there isn't anything particularly special about the steam port vs others.  There are two slightly different modes and two difficulties to choose from, so the game can be replayed a few times before you will probably be done with it for a while.  You can also turn on and off hint prompts that tell you what button to press at the right time to make the game easier or harder.  Just know what you are buying, and that what you see in the steam trailer is pretty much what you get."

At the same time, however, it presents me with just enough that I don't want all the bad to seemingly outweigh the good. So, I'm going to list all it's good qualities and it's faults intermingled together, to try and paint a better picture than a block of negative text would.- I don't like the menus. They're horrible and clunky, and I hate having to put my name in the high scores before it lets me leave. There are some horrendously bad scores in there that it forced me to input.- Don Bluth. Make of it what you will. (I see it as a positive)- The game doesn't go  fullscreen for me. Since it's eighty percent about the visuals, having to watch it in a small window sucked out some of the fun.- Gameplay is simple, almost to a fault. Sometimes it's boringly easy, (I'm looking at you Lizard King!), but other times it flows well and the motions make sense for what's happening on screen.- Sometimes you die for next to no reason. Maybe you pushed the button too late, or didn't realize you should be doing anything, and then sometimes the game just hates you.- Every time you die in arcade, you're dropped into a different, random event. It helps keep away monotony.- This is not true for home mode. Home mode not only forces you to repeat the same section repeatedly until you beat it, it makes you repeat old stages constantly. Avoid home mode!-This game is crazy hard. I don't even know why there are two difficulty settings, I can't tell the difference when I play.-Sometimes you can feel that ""Feed me your lunch money!"" vibe that the more gimmicky arcade games give off. It's easy to die and you only get five lives. Infinite continues though!-The blood boiling difficulty can be avoided (kind of) by using the motion guide feature. I'd suggest it on your first go through, unless you really hate yourself.-Daphne the princess' voice acting is terrible. Thankfully she doesn't talk a whole lot, but when she does, my ears bleed.As much as Dragon's Lair infuriates me, I can't bring myself to hate it. For all the frustration it's questionably timed movements and poor menus give me, it has an oddly charming appeal that makes me want to keep getting back on that mechanical horse and riding it straight into a wall.C+I'd recommend it, but only during a sale.Avoid entirely if you don't like quick time events!"

I'm also glad this remastered version of the game has the option to have arrows to guide you through, because the flashing light that tells you what to do doesn't always show up, like in Dragon's Lair II. But this game is another classic revived by Steam. And I'm super excited to see a Dragon's Lair movie by Don Bluth and Gary Goldman! Finally, after all these years, Don Bluth will return to animation to make this movie!"

But it is a game that requires only the arrow keys and spacebar. Now for those of you who think this is like a game where you can conrol your character, sorry m8 but it aint. You dont actually get to conrol him just make the right moves and choose which way he goes. But the main reason i recommend this game is becuase its very relaxing. Its not a high stress CSGO tkae it or leave it. Its a calming action packed game, where you let the animations conrol your guy. How can i put this; Its like watching a movie that your controling, about a Knight named ""Dirk"" who has to make it through a deadly castle and save the princess.Another pro: This game only took me 34 mins to beat, which is great becuase that means you can Download, play, refund. In that order. Sounds like a win win to me :)And TBH there isnt many cons if your not picky about old games. This game came out in 1983.I remember playing it in 2004, was top of the line then.Thats all for my review. Thanks all for readin."

And often you have to pay close attention to figure out exactly what to do. Having the move guide on ruins this by simply telling you what button you're supposed to press. It's still somewhat fun with the move guide turned on but it really ruins the full experience.

In these zones you fight off bizarre-looking creatures, navigate traps, avoid falling debris, but above everything.. die a lot. Each zone has about 5-10 QTE's and you will rarely get through one without failing a few times. The QTE's are punishingly fast (on hard difficulty) but not overly frustrating as the humorous death scenes make you laugh and the directional cues don't change so you can be ready next time around. Unfortunately not every zone is unique; there are some where they have just flipped the cues of an old one.Even though the game only lasted me about 30 minutes and that's with failures, it was entertaining and funny.

I have been a fan of Dragon's Lair since I saw the TV series and the animation in this game is done by the legendary Don Bluth, it doesn't have his story to it, which makes sense considering such a old game it would be hard to put anything as deep and thoughtful as, say, Secret of Nihm.The gameplay is basically from the birth of QTEs, but even if you failed the animation was always nice to see and it's sometimes quite comical how Dirk can die from a simple trip to being eaten alive by something. If you're a fan you'll have a lot of fun with this, however I can't really say much to be honest as i've already described what the entire gameplay is. If you're searching for something with a real deep and epic story I would give this a miss, but if you are interested in in QTE gameplay with wonderful art which is enjoyable, even in it's frustraition then I suggest you pick this up."

Sigh.Firstly, a confession: I'm old enough to remember when this game was in the arcades. Hell, I'm old enough to remember when there WERE arcades! And I was always fascinated by this game, as it was certainly trying to do something very, very different from what was then the norm. The only problem was, for all it's fantastic imagination and wonderful animation...somehow...it JUST DIDN'T WORK. Not as a game. And it still doesn't.Unless you have spectacularly sharp reflexes and/or can somehow anticipate the ""logic"" of what the game wants you to do next, you're going to find this game so insanely hard that you'll give up in no time. Even with the option to freely ""continue"" that this PC version so generously offers (a luxury only the very, very rich could afford with the arcade version...I was pretty much inserting a new coin in the machine once a minute!), I really can't imagine why anyone would have the patience to see this one through to the end. ESPECIALLY when this version allows you to just sit back and WATCH the game in its entirety, without all that incredibly, painfully pedantic split-second button-pushing which apparently qualifies as Dragon's Lair's ""gameplay"". (It's essentially a game comprised of nothing but ""quick-time"" events.)Definitely one of the great curiosities of video game history and worth a morbidly curious peek, but...I dunno, maybe just look up a Youtube video or something. It'll be cheaper, especially since you won't have to buy yourself a new monitor to replace the one you just put your fist through.Verdict: 4.5/10."

Even if you're not, you may want to wait for a steam sale. But I would definitely recommend grabbing this on a sale at least. Just for the really kewl and unique experience of getting to play a really old skool game I never thought I'd get to play (Not to mention a really unique old skool game in terms of art style and gameplay.)In terms of Gameplay: Obviously, this is a port from 1983, so it's to be expected it's not 100% seamless transitioning between a command and the video display. The reaction commands can be lazy at some points while being unforgivingly instantaneous at others, but the fact that you can continue as many times as you want, coupled with the introduction(?) of flashing hints and arrows to let you know where you need to go compensated for some instances where I would have otherwise said ""What the ♥♥♥♥ am I supposed to do here?"" and given up. If you played RE4, that game stood out because of its great reaction commands. It was part of what made the game, in my opinion, more fun than some other games in that franchise. Other game series tried to imitate it with lesser success. (I remember Kingdom Hearts 2 came out a bit later with reaction commands and they felt really forced most of the time.) I was really pleasantly surprised to see an old skool game be based ENTIRELY on reaction commands and (keeping age in mind) I'd say it even rivals RE4's cutscenes in terms of fun (Which were probably the most fun part of that game. At least for me.). That being said, the gameplay is not very long. Even dying over and over my first playthrough took me a max of 30 minutes. But honestly, I enjoyed that. I got to beat the game multiple times and the achievements generally add to the replay value of the game. I don't have a lot of extra time to try and replay a minimum 4 hour game just to get one ""Don't fire your gun!"" achievement, but in this case, if I mess up it's not a huge loss of invested free time.On to Features: I never played the original given that this game came out six years before I was born. But for people who may have played before and were unsure which features the game may have it does have a scoreboard for you, includes the ad for the game (which I think is shown in the steam store too, because why not), allows you to watch the game as a movie without having to input any reaction commands (I enjoyed watching it afterwards because sometimes you become so focused on the arrows and crap, you can't really pay attention to the details on the screen itself). There's two difficulty modes. I've beaten both...I'm...not ENTIRELY sure what the difference was...You have the option to turn the hints on and off. I didn't really look at the settings though. Appaently you can save (although I have no idea why when the game's so short [high score, maybe?]) and there's also a tutorial which I..uh..ignored.Aesthetically: This game is funny. The death's aren't always as unique and hilarious as a game like, say, McPixel where part of the gameplay is to figure out how many ways you can die, but the voice acting is hilarious, The WAY Dirk moves is hilarious at times and, really, it's just freaking funny how you're constantly on the edge of danger. How every room is just one reaction command after another reaction command after another. Left side of the room collapses, dodge right. Knives fly out of the right wall, leap forward. Spider drops down and hugs your face if you don't kill it. Rest of the room collapses and then the door explodes right after you go through it. It's like what isn't trying to kill you is just unmaking itself. Enemies charge you just to plummet into a newly opened abyss once their onslaught fails. That's hilarious. The cartoony movements and vocals of the protag is hilarious. I'm not a huge fantasy fan, (I just like other genres better) but I think this artist's style is still worthy of at least one spectated run through.Overall, I bought this game for $6 and got more enjoyment out of the 75 minutes I've played so far than I got from two or more hours of other games I've played. I definitely factor in dollar to gameplay hour ratio in my considerations for purchases (that's why I didn't recommend 140 for its market price), but I feel like this game is worthy of exception. $15 may be steep, but a chance to play an excellent old skool game like this is definitely worth an attempt at haggling.[Footnote: If you DO buy this game and like it Space Ace is very similar and also lots of fun :)]"

Quicktime events? Check. Quarter-chewing continue button-mashing difficulty? Oh yeah. Unskippable cutscenes? Creepy hypersexualized damsel in distress whose primary mode of communication is breathy squeals accompanied by the presentation of her ample, barely-covered butt? Paging Princess Sideboob, your close-up awaits. Seriously, add DRM and forced multiplayer and it'd be a sweep.And yet...I had fun with it. Somehow QTE are less offensive when they're expected rather than jammed into what's supposed to be a completely different type of game. The art, as with pretty much everything Bluth ever put his hand to, is gorgeous. So is the character design (Princess Perkynips excepted, perhaps). Dirk the Daring is instantly painted as both stalwart and supremely doofy, setting the tone for the whole thing. And there's a great surge of satisfaction you get the first time you complete the game in a single run.That said, I'm fully aware this is nostalgia talking. If someone came out with a game like this today I'd be shouting. So if you're of sufficiently advanced age to have memories of Dragon's Lair going in, pick it up on sale and have a go. Pretty much anyone else will want to steer clear."

I'd heard of it as a classic of gaming though and it was five bucks at the time so I thought I'd give it a shot. I had no idea what to expect other than the reputation but I was suprised to learn that for a classic of gaming it consists entirely of something that the modern gaming community constantly complains about, which is quicktime events. Really the whole game can be completed with a total of four buttons. Don't get me wrong though. I don't really have a problem with this but it suprised me that the game has the reputation it does when so much of the ""hardcore"" community loves to pick fun at quicktime events and yet this ""classic of gaming"" consists entirely of that.If you're ok with that concept or if you're a fan of the original then there's really no problem here. I can understand the appeal even if it does seem strange by modern standards. If I was a kid with an unlimited supply of quarters I would have probably played the hell out of this just to see what happens next and watch the cartoon visuals unfold.

This game has it's pros and cons as any other game. I suppose if you're a big fan of arcade games, looking for some nostalgia from the 1980's, or simply just something short and fastpaced action/ adventure related then this is a game for you.If you on the contrary want an in-depth plot to your adventure then I'd be inclined to suggest you seek out another lair.Down below I'll try to mix the good with the bad, so you'll get an overal picture about the game.* The menus. From a former design student's point of view they look horrible. Then again, it's from the 1980's so I didn't expect much. What did annoy me a bit though was that the game started lagging while in the menus option. In addition I'm not terribly fond of the whole ""high scores are mandatory before you can play a new game""- thing. Though that's only if you decide to either quit the game in a fit of rage, or complete it. Otherwise you pretty much have infinite lives, and it doesn't take the game long to reload where you died the last time. (A feature I've grown to love about this game)* The gameplay is so simple it's almost boring at times, but it's made up for by the short reaction time you have in most scenes.  The animation flows well and the motions make sense for what's happening on screen most of the time. (Thinking of the princess monologue scene *cough* *cough*, something there doesn't sit right with me. I'll get back to that in a bit.)* Sometimes you die for next to no reason. Especially if you pushed the button (a fraction of a second) too late, or didn't realize you should be doing anything, and maybe pushed the wrong button in the ""crucial moment"" *Point's at myself*Apparantly the game has several modes you can play. I've only played home mode so far, and I found it to be overly repetative. The game forces you to repeat the same section repeatedly until you beat it, and makes you repeat old stages constantly. The only slight difference separating some scenes form others being that they are mirrored.This game is difficult. I've only played on easy mode so far, but I'm concerned for when I'll try hard mode, as I've died so many times in this game it's embarassing.- On a side note, I've seen a couple of reviews stating that the game does not work well with windows 8. That is not the case. I'm currently using windows 8 (or 8.1 to be exact), and the game has worked completely fine for me. If you try playing the game while your power option is checked to ""power saver"", then of course you'll have a problem playing it. If you set your computer to ""high performance"" and make sure that you don't have tons of other programs running at the same time, you shouldn't experience that much trouble.* Now to Daphne, the damsel in distress... I don't even know where to start. This is the thing that has bothered me the most about this game. First off the princess' voice acting is terrible. And I have to agree with Puppet_kamon on this: ""Thankfully she doesn't talk a whole lot, but when she does, my ears bleed."" Second is the oversexulisation. The princess' outfit looks like it's taken right out of a strippers' closet. In addition, her over-the-top, unnecessary posing and gestures, while she is explaining how you defeat the dragon seems very odd to me. It looks like she is, or was ment to say something entirely different than the lines coming out of her mouth. In the end I was left with the impression that the princess was more of an object to be desired and obtained, more than anything else. I also wondered why the creators didn't make time-apropriate clothing for Daphne, as the knight's clothes/ armor looks like it's from the early middle ages, and hers from an other century entirely. (I have lots more to say bout this, but I think I'll leave it as is.)* Animation-wise I have no complaint. I absolutely love most Don Bluth directed projects. The backgrounds are well made, and as stated before, the animation flows well. Otherwise I'd wish for a pause button in the game, as I'd like to view the surroundings a bit more.As much as Dragon's Lair grinds my gears, I can't bring myself to hate it. It's an overall good game for it's time, and was groundbreaking in terms of going from pixel based games to animated ones. I bought it on sale, at 50% off, a completely ok price for a game like this. Though I would not recommend this at it's intended price. 4/10 points."

This means the gameplay is essentially trial-and-error. Press the wrong key, or press a key at the wrong moment, and you lose a life. (Truth to be told, some scenes are more lenient and don't punish you for pressing too early.)I can imagine a kid in the 1980s or 1990s looking at this game at the arcade: ""Wow, this game looks incredible! I want to play it!"" Then the kid puts in some quarters and plays for no more than two minutes: ""Wow, this game sucks! I don't want to play it again!""During a single gameplay (in ""home mode""), there will be repeated scenes/rooms, which left me thinking if the game had any ending or if it would just repeat itself indefinitely. (In other words, a poor design choice by the developers.)Oh, and Daphne, a stereotypical over-sexualized damsel-in-distress. It serves as a reminder from the 1980s culture.---+ Great animation, looks like a cartoon from 1980s.- The animations are usually short, sometimes less than a second or two.- Quick-time-event gameplay requiring very high accuracy.- No gamepad support.- No rebindable keys (although the hard-coded keys seem okay: WASD or arrows, and space).This is a good game for the historical value, for its place in video-games history, but the gameplay is boring and frustrating."

What you likely already know about it, hencce why you're likely even looking at this, is more than enough experience with the game. This game is a monument to bad 80's arcade business practices to swindle kids out of their hard earned cash and nothing more.Most reviews being written by people going back for nostalgia tend to paint this game as something a bit better, but as someone who was born in '88, this was part of a game history I missed, so I bought it to check it out myself. As you most likely know, this is a ""game"" based on just being a very long QTE cutscene and nothing more. What you may not know is how finicky and unresponsive it is. Sometimes prompts show up too late and you die despite pushing the desired key at the right time, and sometimes it lingers with there only being a certin sweet spot in which it registers. I've redone rooms so many times simply because of late prompts or simple unresponsiveness.Now, if you're just here for some Don Bluth animation... then just watch it on youtube or something. The whole experience here is repeating the same two dozen rooms or so(think it's randomized from my two playthroughs) for about 20 minutes(depending on how much you die) all to save the most annoying and overly sexualized damsel in distress and then it's just done. It's a pretty short trip of nothing special even just by animation standards. But since it's coupled with atrocious ""gameplay"", it's definitely not worth the money or hassle.I bought this on sale for about $2.49 and that was still too much in my book. Full price you might as well just shoot yourself in the foot instead. Probably less frustrating, though maybe more painful. Physically anyway.3/10; because it does offer some replayability and has a nice frontend UI and extras where you can just watch the ""game"" without putting up with terrible input reads. Amazing."

As much as some complain about quick time events (and yes this game is basically a very long running qte), I don't mind them as much. In any case, this animated classic is worth the play through if you're looking for some nostalgia, or looking to play through a bit of iconic gaming history. You probably won't get much play time out of it, but it's still a fun little adventure to be had in it none-the-less."

Some didn't even respond, you had to spress 1 second before the actual arrow showed making it very frustrating to play. Another thing is that they just recycle events but mirrored, so same content but instead of press 'right' not to die, it's press 'left' not to die.if you want to see the animatic, go look it up on youtube.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3XNQja0H7IThe only plus side of this game is that the princess is actually a hot pornstar!"

Well now those have existed for years, and the controls and format of this seems extremely limited.   But for it's time, it was amazing.  I played this game in several arcades, and I had it (plus the Dragon Lair 2 and Space Ace) which I played extensively on my Amiga back in the day.  It blew my little mind. It was like a Disney movie next to a bunch of tricolour pixel graphics.  Despite it's reputation for breaking down, It's presence in 80's arcade towered above it's contemporaries.  It was like playing a movie, a decade before CD-ROM games were a thing.  And though this type of videodisk game was tried a bunch of times (sometimes with live graphics and light guns), they never really did a better job than the original Dragon's Lair.This game belongs in the Arcade Hall of Fame.  It's graphics were way beyond anything else release in the 80s (Google ""best arcade games of the 80s""), and if you look at thebest of the 90s, it's still at or near the top of the class for graphics (but not gameplay).  For that reason alone, it's an amazing technological feat for 1983, and you should give it a try.  But unless you played it in the 80s, you probably won't be nostalgic for it, and will find the controls frustrating, and barely touch it."

This is a game us old people played in the video arcade.  It was hard as hell and many of us easily dropped $5 into this game per visit (at 25 cents per game)  The game was impossibly hard and most of us died a few scenes in at best.    This game is for all those people that wanted to play and beat the game, but never had the committment to drop $100 or more into the game to figure out all the moves.Now that I've bought it, it dawns on me just how much I would've ended up having to sink into this game to beat it.  I'm glad there is an easy mode on this that at least tells you which way to go and when to use your sword.  We didn't have that in the old arcade version.But that said, if you've never seen or even heard of this game before, you're probably not going to like it.   This game is just for us old timers to finally beat a game we couldn't when we were kids."

Quaint to the max.For people not familiar, it's basically a cartoon game with ""QuickTime events"".  You have to hit the right direction at the correct time to cue the correct solution to each ""room"".  The game then cues the video from your move making it look like one long movie.BUT! play it as it's meant to be played, go into Settings:BEEPSOFFMOVE GUIDEOFFThe beeps wouldn't be too bad since they feedback that you are actually doing something.. but they are completely annoying sounding.. they really should have made a beep sound effect that was in the world of the game.. instead it's this horrible lo-fi beep noise that is in your face; like a plain old square wave and completely raw soudning; it doesn't fit at all and ruins the immersion.It's a pretty short game, but it's difficult so that makes it long.  Without the guide move arrow you have to figure out which way to move or swing the sword. There are plenty of sequences built into the game that play if you do the wrong thing (some pretty funny). With the move arrow guide you never see these and the game becomes incredibly easy to beat (within an hour) and for $10 or even $5 on sale, that's not really worth it.  Back in the 80's you had to learn the sequences (i.e. LEFT, UP, UP, UP, SWORD not including timings) and tell them to your friends or if you were lucky you could find the sequences in a magazine. So you are better off not using them (guide arrows) - they are basically CHEATS.  Unless you are the kind of player who buys a game and goes right to the cheats, then by all means, go for it.  However, that said, the game is very punishing so you really have to put your timecapsule hat on and play it knowing this is how it was meant to be played (love it or leave it).In small doses it's fine though.  It's not a game meant to be played for hours anyhow.  You used to have to put in 50 cents into the machine and you'd get 3 lives.  So the game was tuned to maybe 10-15 mins of play at a time.. maybe 30 mins for people with money to burn and really wanted to figure it out.Also don't play the WATCH mode, otherwise it completely ruins the game and why would you even play it after seeing that?  Bad idea to have this in the game.I actually find the things they did to this game (beeps, arrows, watch mode) quite interesting and says volumes about how games are played today.  Back then games were so punishing, especially arcade games. Rewards were so fleeting and paltry.  These things that were added to this game completely break it, so if you want the REAL Dragon's Lair experience: turn off above mentioned settings, turn out the lights, and turn UP the volume (or use headphones).  This game had a very juicy eye/ear candy and tactile feel to it that created hoards of people lining up to play it in the arcades (back in the day). This game was a dramatic shift from the bleeps and bloops of the everyday 80's arcade games of it's time."
