I only paid 2 dollars, but I feel like the normal 10 dollar asking price is still more than fair. The graphics are great, the gameplay is enjoyable, and it just reminds me of classic shooters where story didn't matter and you could have a blast just tearing enemies apart with friends. The customization isn't incredibly deep, but still respectable. You can choose between different face and outfit cominations, and there is a nice selection of unlockable weapons (all with multiple upgrades that also change appearance). I've purchased numerous AAA titles in the past few months and this game has already kept my interest longer than any of them. Anyone who puts this game down, especially for the price, simply can't handle the difficulty/play style- which is fine but that doesn't merit a bad review. Anyway, just round up some friends, grab some beer, and have a ball blowing demons into tiny bits."
,Recommended,227480,11592711,"Posted: 7 August, 2014",all,AKatarzynaK,"In God Mode you play as a descendant of an ancient Greek god who is forced to battle hordes of creatures brought forth by Hades. There are five maps in which you can test your skills, each is vastly different and beautifully designed.For every area you enter you will be given a trial to complete. You will be unable to enter the next level of the map until you have completed the trail at hand. These trails vary greatly and range from things designed to make gameplay more challenging such as lowering your maximum health, to more amusing things such as making all of your enemies wear silly tophats.Combat is fun and faced paced as you will continuously find yourself surrounded by enemies. There is a wide variety of weapons which you can earn and upgrade as well as different abilities which you can choose from.In order to make the game more challenging you are able to choose between different levels of difficulty. There are also different handicaps called Oaths which you can turn on at the beginning of a map to give yourself more of a challenge and earn more gold/XP.Some of the reviews for this game seem to be taking it a little too seriously. If you buy this expecting a well polished top notch shooter you will be sorely disappointed. I got this game on sale for $2.00 and feel this was a great price for the how much entertainment it has provided. Well worth the purchase if you’re in the mood for some mindless fun, have a fondness for Greek architecture/♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ized mythology, and have a friend or two to play with."

,Not Recommended,227480,6820269,"Posted: 18 June, 2013",all,Bastion,"I had some fun with this game, but you might not. Let me explain why. So, before you buy, have this in consideration and make sure you're ok with the following:- You have to wait to have fun. Some weapons are more enjoyable than others. But the game has level requirement for upgrades and weapons. This means that you have to put a couple hours on the game before you get to full potential and get to experiment with all the weapons to figure it out which ones you want to use. After that, yeah chances are you will have fun with the game.- The Oaths system (you can get xp and gold bonus at the cost of some penalty like less damage, less health..etc) and the test of faith mechanics (conditions that affect parts of the map and are different each time you play) allow some gameplay customization and some variety.- Play co-op. This game was not made to singleplayer. Old School Games didn't even bother to escalate the number of monsters if you play solo. Of course you can go trough a map playing solo, but what's really the point if you'll beat the same map 3x faster playing with some people?- You probably will have to go on forums look for people to play with you. Let's be honest, not a crazy amount of people plays this game. There's an in-game matchmaking system, but you will probably spend a lot of time looking for players without succeeding. Your best bet is look on the forums where there's usually some players that will happily play with you, regardless of your skill level. You can avoid all this if you have friends you know well that are willing to play with you. But either way, the point i'm trying to make is: you will depend on other people to play this game.-Old School Games is not a great dev team, to say the least. This game had a tons of bugs, some of them avoided people to even play the game. Some of these bugs were VERY SLOWLY fixed, but some of them remain to this very day, still affecting some players. And you know what's best? While people were trying to get the game to work, Old School Games released ""R.I.P.D.: The Game"". You know what that game is? God Mode re-skinned. Old School Game attitude to me is a: ""We have players that can't play our game? ♥♥♥♥ them. We need more money, so let's try to not fix our game, let's be worried in re-skin it to sell it again."". And you know what's even better? R.I.P.D. had some of the EXACT SAME BUGS of God Mode. Seems like a joke, right? Yeah...So, if you are ok with all the above and you still wanna buy the game, go ahead. I'm not judging you. But if any of what i said above remotely bothers you and you think it will ruin your experience, don't."

The Greek Mythology lore is the thing that brought me to this game, but after buying I quickly found out that it was a mistake.Don’t get me wrong the game itself is really great, loads of fun to be honest. The main problems are that the developers disappeared after releasing this game, so there hasn’t been any updates, or fixes in like 3 or 4 years. Again it’s multiplayer only so like most games coming out now days with the “Multiplayer Only” tag die quickly when they are not well known titles. Unfortunately, you will be in que for a game for an hour plus, if you even find a match, and for some odd reason this game doesn’t have a way to browse for a server which would fix the problem altogether.Yes, you can just play solo games, but you will find out quickly this game can become quite challenging even with a group, let along solo. On the forum’s you might be able to find a few people that will partner up with you, but to be honest it’s a lot of headache, considering that this game is really grindy, which is turn off for a lot of people as well.Pro’sGraphic are pretty decent considering how long ago this was made.Voice acting is solid, quite funny as well, if you like corny humor.Gameplay is a blast if you have people to play with.Challenging this game can be.Lots, and lots of customization.Con’sMatch making is almost non-existent.Lots of griding, and I mean lots.Developers are gone.If you still want to play this, I recommend buying on sale for a couple of dollars, but without a few friends that will play it with you, I wouldn’t advise buying it at all."

That is the game in it's entirety.  This might sound fun for mindless fun but the fact is it isn't.  Anti-fun.  A fun vaccum.  The black hole of fun.The developers - real gems.  After releasing a broken game that wouldnt launch they would disappear for weeks on end.  They would respond finally, with a broken patch that may or may not have done anything, but only to promote a new game in current development.  They would then disappear again - to return when some newsbit about their second awful game - R.I.P.D (a reskin of this tripe).  They did delete and ban people from the Steam forums who decided to speak out against an outright scam.  Valve of course was complicit as they always are with the ""contact the blah blah blah for a refund on blah blah blah"".  They got their cut its good enough for Valve.Somehow they finally did release a patch that lo and behold made my God Mode work.  Sadly I played it then.

Each horde are accompanied with special modifiers called ""Tests of Faith"" which add an interesting element and bring nice strategic touch.

You can also upgrade the weapons for more damage, ammo, etc.But I cannot recommend this game for various reasonsThe game is short. Only five stages. Although the tests of faith allow for more random encounters, after a while the game becomes repetitive.The game is completely abandoned. If you want to play alone it will be almost impossible to find a match. The only way is to play with friends. The game support up to four players online. One side-note; you cannot join a match after it started so if a friend want to play, you must start from the beginning of the stage.The game crashes constantly, specially at the beginning of a match.

I would say the people who played, we were experienced players, however even if you have good aim and do not get hit often, you do not have the weapon power, the ammo, the health, or the powers to be able to finish a map. We were able to stay alive, until we ran out of ammo, due to the sheer numbers of enemies. Once our ammo was depleted, we were engulfed with mobs and literally were two shotted.So, after playing on the normal mode and quickly ramping up our money and XP, using the money powers to gain as much as we could fiend, we were able to get some good gear (not the best) and go back to the harder modes. Now, if you've played your fair share of games, you should be okay, if you make a few mistakes, it can be punishing, however, it doesn't get annoying unlike a lot of other games when you die often.My main criticisms to this game are the lack of levels. I think they should have a few more maps. If anyone knows of any, please let me know in the comments. Also, I think the game should have had a bit more content to it, weapons, or monster wise, however I understand, as I started playing, was near a final release.Got three friends who want to kill some time.

It feels really slow and clunky, but it has some neat ideas like every monster arena having a new rule to it like enemies can attack eachother or instead of blood everyone bleeds gold.There's a two weapon limit which I don't think helps the game. You can buy new weapons, but for that you need gold that you get through gameplay, but to earn the right to buy weapons you need to be at a level, and it increases as each level goes on. There are also cosmetics that follow the same rule, but sadly there isn't that much to choose from.There is no singleplayer mode in the game. To play singleplayer you just create an online match and start it without anyone joining in. There is a story, but it is told through a narrator and the loading screens, but to sum up it's basically ""you died and now you need to fight your way out of hades."" You don't have to worry about missing some extensive plot, I think.I think overall it's not a terrible game, but it's not as good as some of the other stuff you can buy here on steam.

And you will have fun within 3 hours. If you have friends to play with you or you don't mind playing 5 maps again and again, I think you will play close to or more than 10 hours."

After I fixed one crash, I got a different one. Fixed another crash, a new one popped up. Online fixes told me to edit my registry and this and that.. I shouldn't even have to do that. Not worth it. I bought the 4 pack and nobody was able to play without issues.Edit: I'm not saying it will be like this for everyone, but look at how many people DO have problems.

You have a relatively small map in which monsters appear and you and your team have to fight them off. Simple as that really. You spend most of your time running from them, trying to kill them until there are none left. A problem with this is that you don’t seem to be able to run very fast and there's a noticeable delay between hitting run and it actually running! Combined with no jump or crouch, you feel very slow and limited in movement. Rather odd for a game that obviously needs a lot a fast fluid movement. Also, you can’t shoot and run at the same time, which is really problematic at times. Add to this the weapon sounds aren’t great and all in all you have pretty unconvincing movement and sound. It’s a shame really, because I think just a few small changes to the game would greatly improve it. But hey, at it’s current price BUY IT and judge for yourself!"

Too bad developers stopped supporting this game, tho. It would be great if developers were still working on it. Here's the pros and cons:PROS:+ Really addictive gameplay.+ Decent difficulty options.+ Charming boss fights.+ Long mazes.+ Fair test of faiths.CONS:- Bugs are annoying. (Sometimes creatures don't appear so it becomes impossible to complete.)- Took us so long to play Co-Op. (My friend had an issue which causes the game crash.)- Not too many players. (Don't buy it unless you have a friend with you to play with.)- Developers have abandoned the game so don't expect new updates.So, don't buy this game unless you have a friend to play with and get used to bugs because there won't be an update in the future."

Graphics are good, music is ok, no technical problems (except for not being able to bind the left/right arrow - fixed with a little external rebind program but still).Its basically any games Horde mode, or for those who still remember, UT Rpg Invasion. You progress through a series of arenas by killing everything, collecting ammo, armor and health strewn about. A little twist on the formula is that each arena can have a random beneficial or harmful or neutral effect like infinite ammo or tougher enemies or just everybody wearing a hat. You get xp and gold, you unlock new weapons and their upgrades (damage etc) with higher levels and then purchase them.The big fat problem is the lasting appeal. Coop makes everything better and again, its  really very well made but i couldnt imagine milking more than a few hours out of this replaying the same five (decently big, granted) maps over and over with increasingly bulletspongy enemies.Less than two euro for about 3 hours of entertainment so im not complaining, however Serious Sam or Painkiller or heck, Mass Effect 3 MP provides the same with more variation."

,Recommended,227480,9948919,"Posted: 27 April, 2014",all,L. F. Antrider,"RATING: 5/10This is a purely splay and flay 3rd person shooter.  It is worth getting if you like 3rd person shooters.The atmosphere is very hellish (which apparently looks like Ancient Greece).  The graphics are great, though.In this game there is no time to strategize, hardly time to aim, and you will often get obliterated unless you're playing with some friends who are packing some heavy heat.The weapons are fun... The monsters are gnarly and neat, although not varied between the different maps.  Unfortunately there are only about 6 maps, which after awhile can get a little old.In the game description on the store page, I think the RPG/looting elements of this game were over-sold.  There are truly not that many customization options for skins compared to the awesome designs the developers could have come up with.  Also,  no promise of any more additional content coming in the future.  Also, it doesn't take very long to hit the XP/lvl cap and upgrade all your gear, at which point there is no need to loot anything at all because there are no consumables to purchase.  The abilities are universal across the board for players and really don't play into any game tactics at all, nor do they really add much to the characters.As far as unique gameplay, each map you play has various challenges you must complete to get through the lvl.  There are only about 10-15 different challenges, but they are randomly selected each map which adds a nice layer of difficulty and mixes things up a bit.THE BIGGEST PROBLEM WITH THIS GAME:  It is a multi-player game that has the SH*TTIEST F*CKING multi- matchmaking system ever.  You will wait for hours to find another person by clicking ""quick match"".  You literally start to hear crickets after awhile.  However, there is a way around this.  Namely, go to the forums, find the thread titled GODMODE KONNECT by moi and add a bunch of friends who play God Mode.  Once in awhile I get a match going with a few good people.  This game can have potential to be fun solo too, though.... that is if you have some large cajones.Overall, this game needs more costumes, more unique abilities, and possibly some consumable items to purchase, and a better frackin multi-player setup.  It is, however, a nice little digression from more serious games.  So take a serious look at getting this game!  (When it's on sale for 2.50)."

The graphics are decent and although the game only has a few levels some of them look gorgeous.This is a typical multiplayer shooter: you fight against waves of enemies and the further you progress on the level the tougher encounters you have. Eventually, there is a boss but not every level has a final countdown in this form. You collect XP in order to level up and upon completion of a level you can pick up a lot of gold coins enabling you to purchase upgrades for your weapons and even to customise your character by buying various types of clothing.God Mode is nothing special but the mythology here makes the shooter an interesting game albeit it still remains a bit mediocre.I do not recommend it for the same reason I did not recommend the two Sniper Elite Zombie Army games: finding a host is impossible! In fact, even if you are the host you can spend eons until someone joins. And do bear in mind that there is a community willing to play this game even 1 year after its release.So, if you have friends who are just as eager to play this game as you are do team up with them and unleash your fury on titans, cyclops, skeletons and any other mythical creatures you encounter.

The weapon selection is uninspired and most will end up using the same pair of guns, that is if the limited selection of maps will still hold your attention.The game does shine briefly in COOP mode, when it works, and will deliver a few hours of intense action, although once the maps have been conquered, the only thing that might keep you around are the ungodly grind achievements (minus the broken one). Stay clear from Old School Games and its puppy-mill crop of games. 2/5"

You'll battle through stages of one of the many levels as reach towers that grant you a certain bonus (whether good or bad) to help you tackle that stage. Increase the difficulty yourself by giving yourself more negative effects for more reward should you finish! A large veriety of guns, wish there was more in terms of customisation though.My one warning for this is that if you want to get the maximum potential of fun out of this game, bring friends! The multiplayer died a long time a go and you're lucky if you find one other person online. You can play with up to 4 people, so you really need to find 3 friends.Also nearly forgot to mention, when you finish a level you go to the treasury room where you race for as much cash as you can grab! You can also kill those 3 good friends of yours and steal their money too. They won't respawn."

I believe), and is fun when you want instant action and feel the need to kill a varity of monsters.Con: -There is no story, which is not a bad thing for some, but just a warning.-There are only 6 levels to play, some harder and longer then others, which gets repetitive when grinding for money and experience.-There are also only 10 types of monsters to kill, with only slight variants in some of the models, which again can get repetitive as well.-There are no mods for this game as well, which again is not a issue, just a warning.-Lastly, expect to play solo unless you have friends buy the game with you, because, at least for me, I've never been able to connect to another person, and I've sat in a queue for 2 hours.P.S. Can't tell you anything about the music, I turned it off and listen to my own when I play8/10 Good for a couple hours of play every now and again when the need for violence arises."

You start by creating a character from the many different character customizations, choose your weapons, oaths, maps, difficulty etc. and everything seems promising and you're good to go.If you're playing by yourself you are soon outnumbered and outmatched on the easiest difficulty which means you're screwed if none of your friends play the game because, even if you're playing with other people they will leave halfway through the game and are generally useless/annoying.However, even if you play with friends you won't be able to complete a single mission because your game will crash 10 minutes into playing it and force close it self, or it will just crash every 5 minutes without force closing and after having a frozen screen for 10 seconds or so it will finally resume.

And at times that even means your buddies!Every player  will unlock the same weapons at the same levels, as well as the costumes.  The way a  person spends his or her  skills points can be vastly different, however.   Some people might choose the heavy weapons that slow the player down, and have a dps ability on the side.   Others might use a lighter build with the ability to run around and heal his or her teammates.   The fact that each weapon and skill can be leveled separately adds a lot to the variety of the builds.   A fun stand alone addition to the game is a bonus round that the team is given after finishing a level.  The players are placed in a small room with loot piles that spawn randomly during a given time limit -- friendly fire is turned on!  Some of the best moment of the game were during the loot grinds xDUnfortunately, the two downfalls are  the lack of maps and bosses, and the visual lag when not hosting.   The lack of maps and bosses can make unlocking the higher level gear and skills a grind after a short time.  The visual lag isn't much of a problem on the first two difficulty levels; however, once the head count goes up with the difficulty setting, and the damage being dealt increases along with it, the story changes.Over all it is a fun game with a modest price tag.   Be sure to let me know if you get it."

It's basically just the memory of me playing The Club back then (awesome !).Anyway, it all comes down to shooting down hordes of enemies and leveling and customizing your character and his weapons. Fun for a few games/hours. After that, you should've seen most of the interesting things already. The best part of the game are the random mutations giving you stuff like unlimited ammo or tougher enemies.

This makes the game alot easier (it's still difficult) compared to just trying to kill everyone without running around the maps.

I was expecting a arena styled shooter with fast paced action and fun loot. Instead I was greeted with a no-tutorial, sluggih and uninspired snoozefest. Theres very little in the way of teaching the player anything, instead the game prefers to toss you in and quite literally laugh at you as you adapt. Advancement is painfully slow. The arena effects would be fun... On a harder mode, but on the first level tend to make it even more overecomplicated. The character moves VERY slowly, and spint (mapped to space, btw...?)  makes you unable to shoot and still doesn't really get you moving at all. The enemies seem straightforward, but will spawn from all over, making it impossible to not get hit, as there will always be one behind you. I haven't sunk alot of time into the game, as you can see, but I really don't think it could get any better, especially after looking at other reviews and scores. In my humble opinion, the 58/100 is a bit too lenient. Maybe in Coop the game shines a little better, or maybe after hour 20, but honestly, there aree other, much bettere games out there.

However, I do expect to play this game more and more as my life permits.God Mode is an arena styled creature shooter. The map is essentially an arena, with health, armor and ammo pickups. You start the match in a lmited area, and once cleared, are allowed access to the next area, not being able to turn back. It's fun in that every sub-area, there is an altar that provides a game modifier, whether it helps you or it helps the monsters. Nothing that completely screws you over, but gives the round that extra oomph. If you die too many times (I believe the number is 4), the game is over. You gain experience and gain occasional gold drops through killing monsters. The bigger the monster, the larger the experience payout. There is a nice variety of monsters and undead to kill, forcing you to analyze and figure out what to kill first. At the end of each of the ""mazes"" (maps), there is a boss. Nothing too overkill, but then again I'm playing on ""Bronze"" difficult (easy). Guns are upgradeable, so that when you lose a match, you can upgrade your arsenal and get further than you did before. It's a grind game. Lots of killing is require to level up, plus guns and upgrades cost a fortune. After nearly an hour and a half, I amassed around 20,000 gold, just to be met with the first gun upgrades costing 10,000 each.The only real downside I have found so far is that Matchmaking is nearly impossible. I sat in the automated matchmaking screen for a good 10 minutes, just to have two people pop in, who left within 10 seconds. You're going to play solo unless you pair up with your friends. There are other flaws in this game that don't really bother me, but honestly you have to go in with no expectation for this game. Just anticipate that you'll have fun shooting and killing a lot of monsters.TL;DR: Fun game, worth the $3 I paid. It's a grind game. Limited maps, impossible matchmaking. Shoot monsters for hours on end."

One is that there is no local coop that would make the game so much better. Two is that it is a bit buggy not unplayable by any means. The only major issue I've had bug wise was during one of my runs the enemies glitched out and I wasn't able to finish the level and move on so I had to quit.

Sure, it's an epic grind fest where all you do is kill enemies upon enemies in 5 different locations. Of course this would be torture if you are to play this game for a couple of hours at a stretch. However if you hunger for challenge, and that without having to put much stress to your brains - This is the game for you. This game is perfect if you enjoy taking breaks between 2 good games by playing short round/level based games like Tetris, Street Fighter, Pac Man, etc. This is just customized for masochistic gamers. However this game does have some fun elements to it, if you don't look at it as a resource for tedium. There are plenty of customizations, weapons and enemy types. The in-game modifiers or the so called ""Tests of Faith"" do bring some excitement to the gameplay. The graphics are decent and the game is set around Ancient Greek Mythology which brings in some diversity. Overall not a must buy, but if you want to throw away a few bucks and can't think of anything better, buy it."

,Not Recommended,227480,14229095,"Posted: 29 January, 2015",all,fuck off,"Hello there. Now I usually don't write detailed reviews, but I thought that I needed to get my opinion out there. This game, God Mode has a pretty interesting story. You are a descendant of a god that was banished from the heavens, and now to prove yourself worthy of becoming a god again, you must fight wave after wave of enemies set in a greek mythological world. Let's get into this.Right off the bat, there's no introduction. It pulls you up to a menu with options to create a match, join one, etc.I decided to create a match to test whether or not the game was actually fun.So I spawned in with my SMG and double barrel and walked to where I thought was the destination I had to go to, as the game did not tell me where or how I was supposed to go.I get to the location and found myself surrounded in a wide open room of skeletons. Classic, I thought.Shooting and moving being the only thing I knew how to do, I tried to survive. Any control tutorial was non-existent.After 30 seconds I was dead.I looked in the controls and found that sprint was space, melee was right click and ADS (aiming down sights) was E, not to mention that the sensitivity for the mouse was extremely high.As an average PC gamer, I can confirm that those controls are completely ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.After changing them to my preferred buttons I continued the game, might I remind you that you have 3 lives and while I was changing these settings I was getting slaughtered without consent, listening to my character moan and bleed.With one life left I managed to kill 10 skeletons and then get brutally ripped apart by a gigantic fat guy.It wasn't pretty.I decided to restart the match and change up my tactics a little bit.All I did was run around the map, firing a clip behind me then collecting ammo/meds and running again.And then when I had killed everything and was waiting to traverse to the next area, I found myself stuck.I saw that the problem was that there was skeleton archers atop a bridge far frome my reach. Trying to shoot them proved it to be nearly impossible without wasting every single bullet I had, as the accuracy on the SMG was absolute ****.After killing them I finally got to move to the next stage, which was pretty much the same thing with a slightly different layout. I died on that stage.Determined to see what else this game had and to give it another shot I tried multiplayer, and to my surprise I actually found another player. Confused, lost and newby, but I found another player!We played the same level I was having difficulty on and managed to get to the second to last stage.During each stage, there is a modifier that changes up gameplay, and the modifier switches upon getting to the next stage. Some are good and some are bad.During my gameplay with this other player on the second to last level, we got a modifier that was meant to be extremely OP, but in turn was a game breaker.Every minute or so, one of the players would get a graphically pleasing and high-damage hammer of the gods, that after another minute would switch to the next player.Both me and him found this hammer extremely under powered, as it hit slow as anything, and only one-hit the weakling skeletons that are usually a 5 shot with your ol' SMG, not to mention that you can't run with this hammer, making fighting harder, bigger, faster foes more difficult. The most difficult to fight was the ranged enemies, as they would run and strafe-fire at you, making fighting them with the hammer completely impossible.That was the level we died on.I really think that the devs of this game, in the beginning of development, had everything going for them. A half-fresh game idea, lots of time, etc. But the direction they took it made the game absolutely horrid. To sum everything up, here are some pros and cons:Pros:Great graphicsDecent level designNo pay-to-winLots of customizationCons:Dead matchmakingExtremely boring farm/grindExtremely difficult as a beginnerBland weaponsBland upgradesCustomization options are all the same with slight differencesThank you for reading this! This was my first in-depth review! Please leave feedback"

The game is definitely meant to be played with a group of people, and doesn't seem to scale down in difficulty. Even on the lowest difficulty, playing solo is just too hard. And the game's progression system is hard aswell. You need so much experience to level up in this game, it's not even funny. I'm sure with a group of able players you could probably keep playing for a long while and progress a lot faster.. But playing solo is just punishing in all ways possible.And why am I playing solo you might ask? Well, there's simply no matches to be found whenever I play. I can try to host a game, but no one seems to join. Either there's just not enough people playing this game, or the matchmaking is suffering from problems in regard of portforwarding etc. which is just sad.The game looks good, feels alright and handles pretty decent with controllers. It's just too demanding and definitely not for the casual player. You've got to grind for hours and hours to progress even the slightest bit. And you pretty much have to progress if you're gonna go anywhere in this game, as you start with the lousiest set of weapons possible.I can't really recommend this title as it is right now, and I doubt the game's gonna change any time soon. It's been out for a fair bit of time now with little to no changes done to it. It's a shame, but it's probably just going to die out eventually. I give it a 5/10 only for the sheer potential it has, but it lacks oomph to it. and players.. and easier progression.. and balancing.. and.. ugh.."

,Recommended,227480,570199,"Posted: 24 April, 2013",all,WeaselBiggs,"Ever played Painkiller? God Mode is exactly like People Can Fly's first offering, if only in third-person. It's essentially arena combat, which involves facing wave after wave of enemies with little to no context or plot considerations. The object is to outlast this rather gruelling gauntlet, or at least to survive as long as you can.To help in this, most of the arenas are littered with colour-coded power-ups. Red for health, blue for armour, yellow for ammunition and gold pickups. Green is bad. Stay away from the green stuff, seriously. Most enemies also drop temporary versions of these same items. Being that the game purportedly takes place in Hades, however, and that you're just one of several wayward souls to pass through here (unsuccessfully), each of the stage's distinct arenas confers one of several random buffs or debilitating effects, a bit as if you'd spliced in Unreal Tournament's Mutators and shoved them through a randomizer.As you can imagine, some buffs will make your life considerably easier (Yay, random applications of actual God Mode!) to markedly worse (you do less damage but your rechargeable ability takes less time to reload?! Dafuq? How is that useful?!). You have no control over which effects are applied and when, which adds to the unpredictability of the basic package. No two games will generate the same items or apply the same stat modifiers, and I'm told the game scales relatively well in multiplayer. The end result is something that plays like a breeze one moment, and that kicks your little heinie to the curb the next. Expect absolutely wild difficulty spikes, considering this – not so much within a single game, but from game to game in general. Considering, your best bet is to learn how to ply your two-weapon loadout as effectively as possible, and to upgrade it as you progress.Otherwise, God Mode comes with a few customization options in the strictly aesthetic area. You've got a few basic heads, a few basic torsos and thematic variations of each for good measure. This is where the game's very incisive but somewhat superficial sense of humour enters the picture. Wanna play as a cowboy zombie in a camo vest with jeans who also happens to wield a laser pistol? Put in some time, and you'll learn enough gold and levels to unlock extra parts.Unfortunately, this is pretty much the be-all and end-all of God Mode. You're throwing yourself into nightmarish gladiatorial matches so you can gain more cash so you can customize your loadout so you can throw yourself into yet MORE nightmarish gladiatorial matches without dying... It's a vicious cycle that only seems vicious, because it has one pre-planned way out; that being the levelling up of every single piece of gear in your possession. Once you've unlocked and buffed everything up, then what?As the game doesn't answer that question, I'll settle with giving it a warm, but cautious endorsement. This is a great quickie for the summer doldrums, folks. Boot up, clear one or two arenas, spend some gold... That's it. No need for serious investment. The guys at Old School obviously know their nineties' FPS gore and splosion-fests.My advice? Buy this absolutely right away if you're an unconditional Painkiller fan. If you're not and prefer your shooters more slower-paced and tactical, save ten bucks for a rainy day and give it a whirl."

,Recommended,227480,4211326,"Posted: 31 August, 2013",all,核 Nuclear,"God Mode is a cooperative arena PVE shoot em up game. First and foremost, it is noted that this particular game is indeed a budget title so not much should be expected as we expect from an AAA game. If you play this game by yourself, you're going to have a bad time.God Mode is more for playing with your friends because the long matchmaking will have you pulling out your hair and sacrificing your first-born to Saxton Hale to fix it. If you happen to be LUCKY enough to get in a full lobby the game has a high probability to crash. Within 6 hours of me playing this game, it has crashed at least twice. However, when you play the full experience without any problems it is worth SOME of the trouble. It is priced at $10 and it's a little bit pricey in my opinion for what it offers. It has a variety of guns and they are NOT reskins. When you upgrade the guns the aesthetics of the weapon also change. Want to use a rail gun as a primary with a mini-gun as a secondary? Go right ahead. You can even customize your character but don't expect Saints Row level of customization. There is ""abilities"" your character can use such as healing aura, shield, etc. Each battle is different from the last because it has a randomized event each time so one battle you might fight giant enemies, the next battle might have one shot kills (this counts for you as well). The announcer is a nice touch but after a few minutes in I just muted the game because the soundtrack is not worth mentioning nor is the announcer.Rating: 5/10 (Average game)It's simplicity gives it accessibility from anyone and everyone but that is also it's drawback. For $10 it might be a bit much, but it can easily offer you 10-15 hours of play-time. It's up to you if you want to pay the price. However on steam sales if it gets lower than $5, try it."

The only good way to play this game is with other people and talking about it, the starting weapon loadout is dismal and short in terms of effective range, and there is no introductory play as far as I remember. You just drop into the game and take what amounts to a peashooter to a massive horde of enemies to start the game off.Now I admit I haven't played much, and I may have played with the wrong settings for my experience and what equipment I have unlocked/upgraded, but I can't recommend playing this.

Developers completely dropped support for this game years ago, and there's a common crash where the game window shows up and then immediately closes. There's nothing on the forums apart from a suggestion to clear your cache and make sure you've run the redistributable.It runs on my 64 bit Windows 7 Desktop but not on my 64 bit Windows 10 Laptop.

It contains shooting, running, shooting, jumping one more time shooting and again running, As long as you can put all those actions together you can easily play it solo on high difficult levels. Fast leveling, allows you to get all weapons in 16h intensive play ( my own exp).  But as always there are some Howevers: 1. If you wish to play with somebody you will have to find steam- friends, otherwiese you will spend hours in matchmaking lobby waiting for team. 2. Game has only few levels and so, especially when playing solo, when you will finally learn how to play GOOD you will soon become bored."

It is extremely fast paced and amazing to play with friends. The experience and gold systems are very well thought out and you feel rewarded after every kill.There is one major problem for me though: the game crashes during every game i tried playing. I would really like to just be able to sit down for a couple hours straight and watch monsters explode everywhere on the screen, but i can never get a full game in. This does not mean everyone will have this problem, I'm assuming that its just a problem that I have yet to figure out how to solve.7.75/10"
