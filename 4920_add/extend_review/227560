I enjoyed the first game immensely, but I knew how broken and bug filled the game was. But the developers have really worked hard because dang, this game is great. It looks ten times better, runs ten times smoother, and best of all, I have not encountered a single bug. Although I played through the original twice already, this one still feels like a fresh new game. They really did an amazing job at making an already fun game into something brilliant. However, the AI is still kind of dumb for the most part. Other than that I am beyond impressed as to how much this game has changed. For $8 you'll be getting a solid single-player or co-op experience. I guarantee it. Plus the multi-player is really engaging and just an awesome time. I would totally buy this again. So do yourself a favor and purchase this game. I know you will have a great time."
,Recommended,227560,9710336,"Posted: 2 April, 2014",all,The Fonz,"Scourge: Outbreak is a generic third person shooter that borrows its design from Killzone, Gears of War, Mass Effect and Dead Space.That said, what it does it does well and the game runs on even older machines reasonably well. There's the ""two weapons and grenade"" weapon style that has become standard, and none of the weapons so far have been anything besides standard style.Enemies are dull design wise but smart enough to blind fire from cover, charge when in groups and take cover or hide from you if you're advancing.Squad AI isn't the best but they've never actively hindered me and if I do get downed they're quick enough to pick me up without putting themselves in danger.The voice acting is okay, it's very 80s action movie so if that's your kind of thing you're in for a treat.Graphics are servicable I can tell what things are even if textures can be a bit muddied.Also the game was free because of owning the original episodes now pulled from Steam so the devs are really cool."

First thing you'll notice is the graphics are GREAT, on par or even better than alot of $40-$60 games in the same genre.  Second thing you'll notice right away is the Gears of War type of gameplay.  Which by all means is not bad at all!!!  I played with my gf who is a gamer too and we just wanted something to pass a couple hours, but we ended up getting very into it!!  And the whole time we kept complimenting so much about the game.  We are going to try the other options in the game or play Scourge Project Ep 1 &2 the day after beating this game.  It definitely goes into my category of magnicent sleeper games!!!!Rating: 8/10"

Genious strike from the devs to hand out a free copy to all owner of the original game.I didn`t think that this game would get a reboot but im glad it got one. The original scourge game had a lot of problems early on which ruined the fun for a lot of people. The multiplayer was really interesting to play due to the fact that its third person with taking cover and stuff.Scourge: Outbreak doesn`t have those problems and really improved in many ways.+The graphics got updated+New and easy way to give all sort of commands to squad mates (KI)+More details to the story+KI got fixedIt looks pretty fun and I can`t wait to get into some dirty multiplayer matches and hopefully playing the campaign with some cool people in coop. Let`s get into this!
,Not Recommended,227560,17258266,"Posted: 27 July, 2015",all,il Duderoni,"Dear God do not play this alone. I'd even say ever, but I did not play this in Co-Op, so there you go.No, really, the reason I start out this review this way is to glaringly point out how not only incapable but absolutely TERRIBLE the teammate AI is in this game.There are games, such as RE5, where the AI can be made to function well enough given some adjustments. (in that case, give Sheva a bolt action rifle and suddenly she's a bullet preserving aiming goddess...)Scourge's teammate AI has absolutely NOTHING to redeem itself. I know I'm beating on a dead horse here, but allow me to point out from what aspects the AI is absolutely failing.- The AI often fails to spot an enemy, even if it's blatantly attacking them. This becomes blatantly obvious when the small alien critters come into play. They'll crawl next to your teammates, take a moment before leaping with their overpowered attack (get hit twice by it = down) and take out your entire team. That skill of theirs has no CD but it's impossible to miss. And the AI... just glares at it. It takes one actual downing before they'll even know it's there!In other words, the AI is blissfully unaware of it's surroundings until its almost too late to react on it. This changes when they are in cover. In fact, when in combat with other humanoids toting guns, your teammates are well capable if you babysit their positioning. Because if you don't... ohhh boy, they'll take cover in terrible angles (exposing themselves) and run from cover to cover just because their AI can't decide.So a part of the game is against armed humanoids. You got your positioning worked out, you place the markers for your teammates...- And the teammates don't always listen to your commands. You'll place a marker in one spot, and they'll take cover behind something you KNOW you did not intend for them to hide behind. Usually it's okay, cover is cover. But the game likes to throw enemies BEHIND you from time to time. So if your teammates don't listen to your planning, which would've accounted for this...Well, then there's lots of reviving to be had, speaking of which...- Your teammates are pretty incapable of being smart regarding Reviving. Let's bring the example of earlier back. A small alien critter has taken down a teammate. What would a smart AI decision be? Take down the critter, then help your teammate up.What do your teammates do? They go straight to reviving. Even if the same enemy is still right besides the downed teammate. In fact, any teammates that are not busy reviving will not AID the teammate coming to the rescue. No, they'll just... Mind their own business. It's really quite dreadful.The one thing the AI does 'sort of' okay, is using their shield skill in tandem with reviving. Sometimes they use it when needed, sometimes they don't (while they really should). Stonewall in particular has a shield he can keep up while reviving, so he's usually assigned as the designated reviver... or at least, so in my mind. There's no actual mechanic to assign him to this role, because...- All you can do with your teammates is point at something for them. Luckily there's a way to pick WHO does what, but in general the only interaction you can do is keep your mouse on something, and context will decide WHAT they'll do. Unless it's a wall. A wall does not mean 'go there' for them. It just doesn't work. You need to point at the actual floor. Which makes pushing up a pair of stairs an absolute hoot.So, let's summarize. Your teammates are terrible at shooting at enemies unless nobody is downed and they're not downed immediately themselves. They're pretty suicidal when it comes to reviving and there's little you can do to guide them other than force them at a spot, where they have free reign to decide what cover to use, and not the cover you meticulously picked as ideal for them. Got that? Alright, up to the next set of issues.The Gameplay itself is... clumsy? I can't think of anything better. The guns that are not meant to be super strong, are super weak. The pistol is useless unless scoring headshots, and the Firefly (the Assault RIfle class, apparently) feels like a BB gun. Shoots fast and takes too long to damage anything, let alone kill even the weakest of things. The Raptor is a burst fire rifle with good enough DPS, and the shotgun is instakill at point blank and useless at any range beyond that. We're talking ""right up in your face"" range. No exaggeration.For most of them, usage just does not feel good. And when the animation quality is laughable (just look at AMP sprinting, it's hilarious) it just doesn't help when the characters are absolutely boring as well.Stonewall is what I assume the leader. He has a little bit of a potty mouth and a dumb attitude, Absolutely unlikeable and boring.AMP is the female-with-attitude because we certainly haven't seen that before... mind the sarcasm...Mass is... a shotgun toting Scot/Irish/I-can't-even-tell-anymore and absolutely uninteresting.And Shade... is supposed to be sneaky? But the game doesn't really employ a stealth system so everything about him is... he's sneaky but enemies spot him immediately so... he's just really weak. Not to mention they advertise him using akimbo pistols but so far that doesn't seem to be a feature in the game. Apologies if it does come in later, I kind of gave up after a certain point in this game.Every character has an AoE and a shield attack special skill. Largely, they're useless for how resource consuming they are, which only refills at certain tanks found in the game (no auto-regen) and for most characters these AoE's are awkward to aim.Level design is in general made for firefights, Even in situations where you're only pitted against Aliens, which CAN and WILL crawl on the walls to maneuver their way around. I have to say, for how stupid your Teammates are, the Enemy AI sure is capable at killing them. Cover tends to mean very little unless you're holed down an actual corridor waiting for an Elevator to arrive.The story? I heard some ridiculous leaps in some video games, but this one took the cake right from the start. Also, the tutorial doesn't seem to mention that your AoE (if ranged) has a fixed range. I was stuck in that section for 10 minutes until realizing that.I have to admit, up until the Aliens arrived, the game was playable as a '♥♥♥♥♥♥ that you could tough through'. But as soon as the critters came into play, only the cheesiest of cheesy tactics can work and not even always then. And, just to remind you, it takes TWO leaps from a mass of small critters to down you. If a teammate goes down, sure, the Player can cover the AI reviving. But if YOU get downed? Forget about it. Prepare for a slow and cringeworthy display of terrible AI that, one by one, come to revive you and find themselves downed by the enemy thats RIGHT BESIDE YOU. It takes actual geography to block an enemy for a revive on you to generally succeed.Seriously, avoid this game. I know some people love playing games that are terrible, but this one just... it's not fun, not even in a laugh-at-a-bad-game kind of way. The only way this can MIGHT redeem itself is if you have a team of four HUMANS that know what to do in order to properly tough through this game. Forget about it on your own, you'll hate yourself trying to finish it.Cripe almighty."

What I like the most is its intense gameplay and  replayability. It's what in my opinion a VIDEOGAME has to be, no more, no less.Trust me, once you get the grasp of the special abilities and how to properly use the enhancements you get by leveling up your character, the overall experience is just great.For those saying it's like Mass Effect, Gears Of War, etc, well, that's a lax and vague statement. Yes, it has features seen on GOW and Mass Effect like 3rd person view, firing from cover or checkpoint based maps, but saying it's a clone of a game just because it includes GAME GENRE  or GAME CATEGORY mechanincs is just stupid. It's like saying Call Of Duty, Battlefield, or Killzone series are clones of.... eeerm.... DOOM? Because they belong to the FPS category??  If you love 3rd person shooters, you'll love this game too, it's that simple.PROS:- Co-op campaign mode (even better with friends on max. difficulty).- Lots of scenarios and special events.- The intensity in the action of some chapters.- High replayability: Once you beat the game, you'll love to replay it with what you have learnt.- Great XP perk system.- ""Shade"", one of the playable characters... he's just so cool- Sniping!CONS:- Some enemies are too hard to beat down and this can get a bit frustrating at the beginning.- Hard to find pvp games- Could've had more remarkable differences among characters' abilities.- There are moments in the campaign where the voice of Reisebeck telling you what to do next gets really annoying (he just won't shut up...)My advice? GET THIS GAME, for its price it's well worth buying it!"
,Not Recommended,227560,9709694,"Posted: 2 April, 2014",all,William Shakesman,"Outbreak is a huge improvement over the original Scourge Episodes and, for the price, is a bit of solid TPS action. You can't easily get Gears of War on PC so this is the next best thing.Problem is, it still has a long way to go. Guns feel weak because enemies are Gears style bullet sponges and guns have Gears style spray patterns, and some of this feels Gears-style just because that's what the devs loved and wanted to emulate. The shotgun may as well be a confetti cannon.I can see where this might be fun in co-op, and it's not especially bad otherwise, but it just does not excite me. For $7 worth of Unreal Engine shooting, you can have a good time, but I have so much trouble picking this over other decent TPSes.All that said, I DO commend this game for not wasting your time. Precious little of it is scripted. It is quick to funnel you from room to room and give you loads of things to shoot. Very few other Gears-style shooters really have this focus, instead throwing QTEs and cutscenes and slow-walking segments at you and too much other boring crap.It is not quite fun enough for me to recommend, sadly, but it is still good enough that it is worth playing if you come across it or crave some co-op TPS action."

( Just go along with it )What I meant by that is : This game is flawed ( animations feel a bit awkward no one runs like this, like a sexy model moving hips and shoulders creating those curves... gah.... ) weapons at times feel underpowered for example burst rifle can take more shots than a smg with dmg mod... ) However on PvP with bots combat is rather intense and its important to use skills and cover. Its the AI enemies in Campaign that feel like bullet sponges...How I like to think of this game is : Poor's man Mass Effect.You have your special abilities, weapons and a story ( which is a bit ....insignificant? )But you are here for combat and Co-Op experience not the story! So this is where this game shines :) If you have buddies pick this game up it's fun with other players and you can play the whole campaign :) Plus this game is quite cheap!Oh the amount of times i spent a lot of money on early access games just to regret it... but I don't regret buying this game."

I bought this on sale but after playing it I would have paid full price. Buy this and tell your friends to get it. I had fun with it alone so far and co op will be awesome. By yourself your ally AI is very good. You get hurt they're there in under five seconds. I didn't even use the quick order system (a button wheel system to order them around.) They did everything well on their own (covering fire, moving up, healing, etc). The enemy AI was very good as well. If you let your guard down or get reckless and rush in you will become nothing more than a hole-ridden corpse. Plot was simple and understandable and for me that's all I need. The weapons in the game were cool and should try to use all of them for achievements and to see which one fits your style. The game looks awesome and I don't even have that good of a computer (I have an i5-4200U cpu and intergrated graphics so if you have a good rig with a good video card this game is gonna look gorgeous).

The game is not bad but its just kind of dull after awhile. The story is pretty generic and then it tries to add a twist at the end. Its a really bad way to tell the story. We know throughout the game that things aren't as they seem but then to just puke out information for two minutes at the end isn't good story telling. You could tell they had some good ideas and maybe wanted to tell more but the execution was poor. The ending tries to leave you on a cliffhanger but all it feels is like a waste of time.You are going to spend a lot of time running around and shooting stuff and the combat never really feels that satisfying. There are a few weapons that are fun to use later on in the game but the same four you end up using for most of the game are just unexiciting.

They knew that they will not make a lot of money on this game, they knew that the first Scourge wasn't a very good game, still they fixed most of the bad things, redesigned the levels, added more features (I really like the XP and skills system), improved pretty much anything, for instance the enemy AI (they really are pain in the♥♥♥♥♥since the half of the game!), shooting and cover system. They even gave away this game for free for everyone who owns the first Scourge.And that's why this game is worth a shot. Yes, it is a generic Gears of War clone with Mass Effect elements. Yes, the low budget is visible in every inch of the game, and yes, it still needs some fixes. But as I said - developers really CARE about the players, unlike pretty much every single one of the BIG companies, so I guess such rarity deserves some support from us ;)And with such positive attitude, energy and enthusiasm I hope they'll make it big some day.Thanks for your time and effort, guys!

This applies ESPECIALLY if you played the first version of the game (""Scourge Project: Episodes 1 &2"") but found it a bit disapointing. They reworked the controls, adding things like rolling and a smoother cover system. The textures remain bad but they added lots of visual effects which make the gunfights pretty intense.The character XP and perk system is more intuitive and is better explained to you know, and is accessible even without being online. Oh, and the Gamespy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t has been removed from the game meaning multiplayer is possible again.The levels are pleasantly bright and colorfull now which goes a long way towards making the game feel less like a cheap Gears of War knock-off.The best part is the way they added a lot of little story moments which make the playable characters a lot more fleshed out. For instance: the tutorial mission starts with a little cutscene unique to whichever character you're playing as that shows you a lot about their personality in less than a minute.The devs took a disapointing game and fleshed it out so that now it lives up to most of what I wanted from it originally."

They use the F# keys but just skip the key assigned to the soldier you are currently playing as.

As a modern shooter it still doesn't hit the target in terms of graphics and the conrols can be very unwieldy indeed. It doesn't help that if you have a gamepad installed all instructions of how and what to do will appear as gamepad mechanics whether you are using keyboard or not. It is a far better game to play using M+Kbd as targetting with the right stick is fairly jerky and inaccurate in comparison. If you are interested in co-op shooters this may be worth a look but as a single player experience it remains dated and flawed despite the much appreciated gesture of making it free to owners of the original.

The campaign can be played solo or with up to three other players.  I never played this game in co-op mode, so look elsewhere for reviews on that.  This is purely a solo campaign review.I beat this game back when it was called ""The Scourge Project.""  That title is gone from the Steam Store now, and previous buyers got this remake for free.  The update is purely visual, so I'm just going to review my experience of the original game.The story is passable, but it takes the back seat.  Some of the voice actors are good, most are not-so-amazing.  There's a touch of character development, delivered in flashbacks, throughout the campaign - which is kind of neat considering it begs multiple playthroughs to learn the true background of all four playable characters.Back when it was originally released a year or two ago, I took around nine hours to beat the campaign.This title focuses on action and cover-based shooting mechanics.The controls aren't as good as Gears of War, nor the graphics, neither the story, but for eight dollars, it scratches the console shooter itch.7 out of 10"
,Recommended,227560,11010690,"Posted: 1 July, 2014",all,kirtanloorii,"Basically, it's a short, little Gears of War game. I like the controls, and the gameplay is pretty good. My only real complaint about the main campaign is the fact that enemies take too much ammo to kill, especially when you begin to encounter the scourge creatures. You might kill three or four before you run out of ammo with a particular weapon. Fortunately, there is LOTS of ammo lying around. You just have to go get it. Also, there are times when you are pinned down and it would seem that the best solution is to just hold your position. However, this is not always the correct solution as there are times when the enemy will send an infinite amout of enemies to attack you. You have to fight through them. This would not be a problem if your team members would tell this to you in order for you to get a hint. Other than that, I find it to be a solid third person shooter experience. It's too bad this game did not do better.Also: This game has BOTS that you can use for multiplayer. I am very happy about this because there has been a major shortage of bots in games lately. This is now my official game to play when I want to play a shooter but not with others (I hate multiplayer)."

In the first 20 minutes I was tempted to turn it off and uninstall, due to the fact that the story became stale from the get go, as well as how the hit reg was implemented. Soon after you empty your clip into a dumb enemy, you'll no doubt notice that it takes more than half a clip for the enemy to go down. This is due to the first few bullets which register, which then triggers an animation in the enemies model so you know you're hitting them, but sadly the animation also negates any other bullets to register until such animation is done executing. Once you notice this, you'll find that firing in short bursts, spacing your shots so that the animation finishes through, then fire again is more effective, but also ridiculous. I also haven't come across a game in which an enemy needs 2 - 3 headshots before a death...Scourge: Outbreaks story is also unoriginal and has been told many times before. Basically a mega corporation has monopolized a vital resource but by a sinister means, and thus you are tasked to fight your way to the grand dismantling of said corporation. This story has been told in the ""Alien"" universe to some extent, and  is way more interesting.The AI is, for the most part, stupid. Think of the Dreamcast or Nintendo 64 days, in which the AI ran around blindly or jumping for cover in which you are behind, taking such cover, then realizing that you're the enemy and then starts to shoot you. The story tries to reconcile this by telling the player that ""They are under psychic control!"" which basically means that the developers decided that it was easier to implement a stupid AI than to implement a stronger one, and try to reconcile this through the story. Thankfully, most of us gamers see through ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t and laziness when it comes to games like this.Though I've only played a brief bit of the game, I feel confident that this doesn't break any new ground, or even old cracked ground for that matter. The story is worn, the graphics are unspectacular, the voice acting us below sub-par, and the feeling that this game is a waste of time is enormous. If I were you, I'd save your money and buy something more worthwhile than Sourge: Outbreak.UPDATE: After 3 more hours of playing this game, I can truly say that this game sucks. Infinite spawning enemies, grenade spam by the AI, the part in which you gotta destroy a dropship becomes more and more difficult (Dropship fires increasinly more rockets) as you try to destroy conduits which take forever to destroy. Oh, and the ally AI likes to group together and take cover behind each other, as that's what we do when we real people play these sort of games."

It tries hard to be a Gears of War clone but fails in every sickening way it possibly can. Enemies are at the very least three or four times as bullet spongey as enemies are in GoW and it isn't fun dropping multiple clips into every single enemy when the entire game around it sucks so badly. Some enemies are even double that bullet spongey like a boss in The Division but much more often than that, usually mutiple of them each level. It all feels very generic too because it is. Every aspect of it. You can't take much dmg so you will spend a lot of time waiting for your teammates to revive you. You can't aim grenades so good luck getting much use out of them.Worst of all? It has the worst checkpointing I have ever seen. If you die you will often be re-doing upwards of 10+ minutes of work and because every enemy is a super bullet sponge, 10 minutes easily feels like a half hour. Graphics suck too, the whole game sucks.

It was a blast to play Doom like this, but in full 3D, you just feel visually impaired. Anyhow, Scourge : Outbreak solved this problem, so I finally was able to play it.Aside Left 4 Dead, it was the second time I played a ""third person / team based / tactical fps"" but since I love real-time party-RPGs like Dungeon Siege, or turn-by-turn tactical RPGs like FallOut Tactics, this one sounded engaging.The gameplay is pretty straightforward : choose one of the 4 characters, use a tutorial if you need and get some backstory (nice addition), then run into action with your fellow heavily armored buddies, receiving mission updates along the way.It seems that the game makes a good use of modern FPS tropes like choose-2-weapons-to-carry and glue-yourself-behind-boxes. The orders you can give are contextualized : depending on where, who or what you are targeting, you can have the closer team member take cover, focus on an enemy, open a door, use a turret, revive another team member ; without losing the pace of the fight which is great. Overall, each team member is a decent shooter and never forgives to save you even under heavy fire.The special abilities are kinda neat, but for me, the real pleasure of the game was to consider each confrontation as a puzzle : where should I position each team member in order to assault or defend? Sometimes an sub-optimal line of sight could cost your team frequent death/revive cycles.The enemies are challenging enough, even in beginner more. Soldiers can take advantage of the level and bosses requires some strategic planning. But the strange design decision of infinite critters that mysteriously vanish when you reach the next checkpoint somewhat disrupted the experience.Since the storyline is purely functional and the characters kinda stereotypical, playing solely for the story won't reward you. It seems that there is a leveling mechanic, granting you points in different categories like ""short range kill"", ""head shot"", ""assistance"" but I don't know if it grants you with bonuses except for the powers.To wrap it up, Scourge Outbreak is a decent team-based shooter, with a nice game flow, and correct level design. Nothing truly memorable though, so it feels more like a filler."

So I thought it odd that I hadn't played the original Scourge: Outbreak episodes even though I had bought them a while ago. But thanks to the generosity of developer Tragnarion Studios I was able to play the remastered version. My thoughts? Not too bad. You play part of a group of mercenaries looking to take down the Nogari Corporation and retrieve a piece of meteorite used to create a powerful synthetic. Scourge really doesn't bring anything new to the table. It's chock full of 3rd person run and gun action and really that's about it. You go from point A to point B killing lots of aliens and other things in your way. The graphics aren't bad, the controls are responsive and it sounds good. It does have a few bugaboos though. The AI is not good. Not the enemy and certainly not your squad. I bet multiplayer would be an absolute blast. The checkpoint save system SUCKS. If you die mid mission, prepare to repeat stuff and you WILL die during this game as there were times where I found it very difficult. Parts in Chapter 2 had me wanting to bang my head. The level design is also pretty uninspired. other than a cool section inside a mountain and some areas towards the end, you'll be indoors traversing labs etc. Pretty bland. But that said, if you're looking a  pretty fun way to blow 6-8 hours you could do worse than Scourge.

I can honestly say that if you're planning to play this game for great effects and a large majority of powers and weapons, you bought the wrong game. This game is lacking, in near on all aspects. The weapons are limited to a few types: smg, assault rifle (burst only), pistol, Sniper rifle, grenade launcher, and maybe 1 or 2 more i forgot to mention. The powers are the same, relatively speaking, for each character. And the movement animation is the same as well, which isn't that big of a problem until you see the female character walk. (I laughed). The redeeming quality of this game is the action. The action is good, very good. There are points in the game where you don't think you'll make it out of a fight unless you time your powers just right. The action is partly why i have near on 50 hrs. in the DEMO alone and why i bought the full game later on. The story is good too, they could have added a bit of background to each character but the point of view you have differes with each character you play (there are flashbacks). All in all, this is not what i would call an 'awesome' game, but it is good enough to buy for the price it's listed at, not to mention it runs on sale quite a few times.

Wasn't compelling enough to finish, but isn't the worst thing you could play if you're bored.Possibly worth it for the 4 player co-op, but there'd probably have to be a pretty big sale.barrel roll out of 5."
,Not Recommended,227560,21005692,"Posted: 6 February, 2016",all,dustdust,"This is the homeless man's version of Gears of War (if he also had a gimpy leg). The main issue is that co-op is forced upon you from the start, thus making you rely on your 3 incompetent AI idiot partners (don't bother trying multiplayer since it's completely dead). Even if you don't die, they will and you will be forced to start from the last checkpoint (in which there are  far too few in a game that heavily relies on bad AI). Issuing commands is useless because rarely ever will they attack the enemy they are supposed to. All of the guns seem underpowered (at least in Gears, a few headshots to the Locust grunts will put them down quickly; in this game, it doesn't matter if you shoot them in the head or legs, there is no difference in damage). The cover system is passable, but your character oftentimes will slide to another wall or obstacle that you don't want them to. Don't bother wasting your time or money - play Gears of War instead (or wait for it to be released on Steam, however long that may take)."
