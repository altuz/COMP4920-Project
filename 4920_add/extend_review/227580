Your matching skills control the time limit which is represented by a character above the puzzle who runs through a dungeon hacking away at enemies, opening chests and doors. Eventually you really need to keep your eyes peeled and make well thought out decisions to make it through. What helps make this game so addictive is the ability to upgrade your stats and weapons as the dungeons will progressively get more difficult. the goal is to score 10,000,000 points in one dungeon run, which seems almost impossible. For what it is, a match 3 game, this game rocks I'd say 8/10"

Though the game is primarily a Match-Three, every single type that you match provides an effect that drastically alters your current encounter.  Match three (or more for an increased effect) swords, for example, and you'll unleash a physical attack; match three magic wands, you'll cast a magical attack; match three keys, you'll unlock a treasure chest or door, etc.The game is quite challenging, though each time you run through a dungeon path you'll acquire gold, experience, and items that will aid you in future runs.  Gold can be used to upgrade your equipment (swords, staves, shields, armor, etc.) by choosing a specific trait such as the sharpness of your sword (critical chance) or the material that it is made out of (base damage).  Experience can be used to purchase training upgrades which enhance abilities such as your lockpicking skills and increasing damage against certain enemy types.All in all, it's a cheap game with a good amount of fun to be had as long as you keep that in mind."

While the game delivered less depth than the concept seemed to allow for, I still got a very fast-paced, addictive, and satisfying puzzler. It was cumbersome using a mouse to play a game that was clearly designed with touch screens in mind, but the gameplay was enjoyable enough at its core to ease that pain most of the time. The music was catchy, and the variety of things to level up provided enough incentive to make it through most of the game. What I most appreciated was the fact that you're unlikely to brute force your way to the 10,000,000 point goal by simply grinding enough to level everything. Success is ultimately the result of strategy, speed, and good fortune, which was refreshing after the way so many other smartphone ports that have made it to this platform just hand victory to the player after a significant enough investment of time and virtual currency. It's unlikely that you'll want to revisit this one after beating it, but the asking price is very reasonable for a game of 10,000,000's overall quality."
,Recommended,227580,7742867,"Posted: 25 November, 2013",all,Colonoctopus,"10,000,000 is an arcade match-3 RPG with base management mechanics. Now, that may sound schizophrenic, but all the features actually mold together quite well to create a strange but fun experience. The gameplay consists mostly of dragging rows of cubes in order to match 3 of a certain type of cube, thereby helping you pass whatever obstacle you are currently faced with. Unfortunately, the game often gives you tons of whatever you need the least of at a certain time, leading to quite a lot of frustration. I remember one run in which I started out with a ton of keys.“Yeah!” I thought. “I’ll be totally set for this run!”I was then presented with about  10 or 15 obstacles in a row that required keys, and I ran out about halfway through and had to simply bide my time until the one match that I needed came along, using up all of my special items and powerups in the process. Now, whether that was built into the engine or I just have the worst luck in the world remains to be seen, but that kind of thing happens extremely frequently.The gameplay sometimes gets as annoying as the music (an extremely loud 8-bit tune in an endless loop), with the aforementioned situation of having everything except the one thing that you need providing nearly endless frustration. The goal of the game is to get 10,000,000 points in a single run, because apparently that will help you somehow escape the prison you are in. While in a run, you can collect special items for use in a pinch, as well as building materials, gold, and experience. You can use the building materials to fix and upgrade your base. What benefit do base upgrades give? They help you waste all your gold and XP getting upgrades for your equipment.Later on in the game, the price of training skills and getting upgrades becomes completely outrageous, whilst you are left sitting on a huge pile of wood and stone with nothing to spend it on. One thing I did like about the game was the difficulty curve. As you gather more points and complete objectives, you rank up and are forced to face harder and harder monsters. Thankfully, this gives the game a natural flow. Every time you rank up, the super-hard boss monsters that used to always kill you before you could get any matches in become commonplace grunts.Overall, 10,000,000 is a fun game, and it is definitely worth 5 bucks for the hours of gameplay you will undoubtedly get from it. While many players like me will ragequit often, you’ll always be coming back for more. I hope we can see a more polished and less frustrating sequel sometime in the future."

As with most games of this type, you don't need many words to describe how you play.The core gameplay consists of sliding rows and columns of various icons so that three or more align, making the aligned icons disappear and making new ones fall out of the top to replace them. The spin that 10,000,000 has to offer is that you're a prisoner of a dungeon, and you must score, well, 10 million points to get out. You earn points by killing monsters and opening doors and chests, by matching staffs and swords, or keys, respectively. Matching backpacks gives a chance of earning items, which you can then use to kill monsters, to give you more time in the dungeon or to open chests and doors. There are also wood and stone icons, which give you those as a resource that stays the same between playthroughs. There are two other, similarly working resources: experience and gold, which are earned by killing monsters and opening chests. Once you run out of time in the dungeon, you return to the main hub where you can use the resources you've amassed to upgrade your statistics in rooms that can be upgraded. To progress through the dungeon you must complete quests such as ""match x amount of y tiles"", or ""make x amount of triple matches"". Eventually, a quest involving scoring a set amount of points during a round appears, and upon completing the quest, you gain a new rank and may now start the next run further in the dungeon.Now, that looks like a ton of words, but that is literally all the game has to offer. There is nothing else in this game (apart from the ending, which I won't spoil, but trust me when I say that I wouldn't need many more words to describe what happens after getting 10,000,000 points).The game sports a ""retro"" feel to complement the mechanics, which works fine. The pixel graphics are good, but not amazing. The music is also pretty nice, but there aren't many tracks. After a few runs, it gets very repetitive, to the point where I, a person who usually sticks through with a games music until the end, had to use my music library instead.Unfortunately, all of these facts point toward the game being an obvious mobile port, designed to be played in short bursts of playtime. As a result, the interface is a bit huge when playing in full screen, and the options menu is very lackluster (not that it needs to not be, given the simple graphics of the game).The RPG-ish equipment upgrading mechanics aren't bad (I love it when the name of your armor changes based on the aspects you choose to upgrade, possibly giving names such as ""immovable cloth ring mail"" or ""soft diamond shirt""), but what's the point of having a visual representation of your character if he looks like a pixelated Indiana Jones regardless of whether he has mythril plate-mail or a cloth shirt? It's not like there's thousands of equipment possibilities.Overall, 10,000,000 feels very repetitive. It's good at what it does, and presents a spin on the ""match 3"" puzzler mechanics, but this doesn't remove the repetitiveness problem completely. The equipment upgrades seem like an after-thought because of how they do not affect the character visually. This game hangs in the balance between ""I recommend it"" and ""I don't recommend it"", but equipment non-visualization forces me to say that I don't recommend 10,000,000.This does not mean it is a bad game at all, but I just wouldn't recommend it to anyone but the most hardcore ""match 3"" fans. The developers still update the game though, so I promise to change the recommendation if they do visualize the equipment upgrades. In my opinion, a good ""match 3"" has to have a good core system and a great spin on the formula. Visualizing the upgrades would make the spin in this one great, instead of ""just"" good.EDIT 2015/05/28 - Noticed I misspelt the title of the game every single time by forgetting the commas.

The matches you make down below push your character through combat and exploration above. Each ""run"" through the dungeon takes a minute or two. But as you run, you achieve a series of objectives which the game gradually presents to you, which leads to improved skills.The game's genius is the way it rewards you not for a lifetime score, but instead for pushing your single-run high score higher and higher, until you can reach 10,000,000 in a single run. As your character improves a bit with each run, cresting your previous high score becomes theoretically easier each time you run the dungeon. Die, and you can either quit the game, or try one more run almost instantly.It's not a deep game, but I can't think of many games that made ""just one more turn"" so compelling. Like, ""Civilization""-style compelling. It's so easy to try again, over and over. A minute here, a minute there, next thing you know, 2 hours have gone by."

Taking damage through enemies pushes you even further quickly, getting kills among other things pushes you to the right again.You play by dragging a line or column around and then having at least 3 of the same tile in a line. There is only a few tiles that dont change either and each has its own use, swords and staffs do physical and magical attacks, keys unlock doors and chests etc. Above the field you can see what you are currently faced with and therefor know if you for example need to match key tiles.During each run you gain ressources that all serve the purpose to make you stronger and go further, be it by having your attack tiles do more damage or by increasing your defense or increasing critical hit chance etc. While this means you grind for ressources run for run it doesnt really feel like a grind upgrading is more like something on the side to do next to playing the game.Another distraction is the little side quests that you get, many are luck based or happen sooner or later anyway, like matching 5 of the same tile in a single strike multiple times in one run, others require you to use specific items (that you randomly acquire during runs and since you can only carry 3/4  use quickly again anyway)While you will gain ressources no matter how you play the game does reward you for playing well, for example if you manage to be so far ahead of time that you end up on the right edge of the screen and can keep that up for a bit it gives you a nice amount of bonus experience or gold and big chain reactions or 5 tiles in a row etc also benefit you.In the end getting to the 10000000 scorepoint isnt that complicated, especially if you have every single upgrade and think carefully what potions to use, however the steam achievements crank it up a notch requiring you to achieve that same score with a much lower point multiplier, setting an endgoal even people who are good at these games will have to work for to reach.You can probably beat the game in less than 4 hours though i would say it isnt really made to rush through in one sitting, rather to unwind with a little puzzlegame for a bit every evening, or something like that. And while the pricepoint is higher than many similar games I would say it is almost worth it and totally worth it when on sale for even less."

The twist in this one is that the matching mechanic works in conjunction with the actions your character takes at the top of the screen. The character's goal is to keep moving to the right, clearing obstacles such as monsters, treasure chests and locked doors. In order to clear those obstacles, you need to match specific types of tiles (swords to kill monsters, keys to open chests, etc). Getting hit or not matching tiles causes you to slow down and creep towards the left side of the screen. If you get pushed all the way back, the run is over. After each run, you return to a dungeon where upgrades can be purchased using the resources collected during the run (wood, stone, gold and experience). And that's pretty much all there is to it. Basically, you just keep running through the dungeon and buying upgrades when you die. Reaching certain score milestones causes you to rank up, which allows you to achieve higher scores and travel further into the dungeon. The ultimate goal is to score the titular 10,000,000 points and escape. On the technical front, the graphics are extremely simple, done in a low-res pixel style. It works for what it is, but the visuals are really nothing to write home about. I did really like the music, though. It's pretty catchy and very NES-esque.In summary, if you are a fan of ""match 3"" games and don't mind spending a few hours on the mindless grind it takes to complete (I would estimate around 5-6 hours or so), then by all means, give this a shot. However, I really must reiterate that the gameplay is the very definition of a grind - the whole experience from start to finish is extremely repetitive. If you have a short attention span or really don't like doing the same thing over and over for hours, do NOT buy this game. Additionally, I have to say I also think the price is a little too high. For some reason, it's double what it costs on iOS, which doesn't make a whole lot of sense. I'm not saying it's a rip-off, but this might be one of those cases where you may want to wait and see if it goes on sale at some point."

Well... ok...While the game does have an interesting concept it annoyingly relies on luck and what tiles the game decides to generate more than anything else, much like Bejeweled or similar puzzle games. If a monster is in your path, you'll have to quickly match sword or staff tiles to do damage. A locked chest requires matching key tiles. And as tiles are random, one might find oneself stuck, matching any tiles at all, hoping to match enough of what is needed before time is up.At the start of the game, be prepared to lose, quite often, until enough materials are gathered to unlock upgrades. While initially the upgrades that can be purchased come in handy and allow one to make quick work of monsters, the upgrades have a max level which in my opinion is too low. Especially during the latter ranks, and especially when fighting bosses. Even completely maxed out requires, more often than not, way too many tile matches and wastes way too much time. However, there are items to find thru out the dungeon run which can help somewhat. Scrolls that will change wood or stone tiles to keys, swords, or staves. Various weapons and orbs to hurl at monsters. Skeleton keys to easily unlock chests or locks. And food items that will give you a time boost. With that said, the weapons, orbs and skeleton keys must be used rather precisely; if used a split second too early when arriving upon a chest or monster the item does nothing and disappears. The same can be said for tiles too. It would have been nice if there was some leeway as making sure the dungeon runner is close enough to an obstacle before using items can waste valuable time, even if just a split second.And possibly the biggest time waster in the game, combos. Match some tiles, more fall down and they match. Combo! They are sometimes handy like during a boss fight. Except when the tiles continue to fall and continue to match it becomes a potential death trap. Yes, I've lost more than once awaiting tiles to stop falling and matching others because during this time nothing else can be done. And if the reason I lost wasn't because I ran out of time, it was shortly after because the combo completely used up tiles that would have came in handy just a few seconds later.Replay value? Prepare to spend several hours upgrading everything before even attempting a run for 10,000,000. But after one does achieve freedom by getting to a score of 10,000,000, the only reason I can think of to come back to this game would be to try for a higher personal score (no Steam leaderboards), or to earn all achievements. Personally, once I complete all the achievements I doubt I will ever play this again.Is 10,000,000 fun? Sure, it can be. Would I recommend it? Hmm. Not at the full price of $4.99. I picked it up on sale for less than a dollar. At that price it was worth it. While I don't really want to vote thumbs down, I'm going to have to since Steam has no neutral option."
,Recommended,227580,29628383,Posted: 1 February,all,Sandalwood,"As a puzzle and strategy enthusiast, I've played my fair share of games and it's always a treat when a game brings something new to the table.  Deviating from the typical 'Match 3' formula, you may find snapshots of the game misleading--the tiled board looks just like any other matching game--but 10000000 has a surprise for you:  You're not going to move the tiles.  You're going to move the BOARD.'Hah!', I hear you scoff.  'That doesn't seem like much of a difference.'  That's what I thought, too, until I played it.  Manipulating the board this way bends your brain in a completely different direction, as you cannot simply adjust one tile at a time.  Every move you make will affect the entire playing field in ways you may not be able to predict at first and it adds new complexity as you struggle to speed through each encounter, which brings me to the other half of the gameplay:You will encounter various monsters with different resistances and weaknesses, locks to pick, chests to open, and all the while the clock is working against you to clear the precise tiles you need to beat each challenge in a matter of seconds.  It comes with an RPG element that rewards your accomplishments and encourages you even after a defeat and, on the whole, it makes for a very engaging experience.  As for flaws, the music can become a bit droning after awhile and it's likely to become stuck in your head very quickly, and a few cracks show in the few scattered misspellings (you're going to be 'poisioned' quite a bit), but on the whole, it's a good game.I feel like the developers missed an opportunity by not including more for the player to do.  Sure, you can keep playing it as long as you like, trying to raise your high score, but since the game revolves around meeting certain score or endurance goals, once you have completed all of said goals and related achievements, it feels like there's no further challenge.  It's just about right for the price and should provide several hours of entertainment."

As such these games will take you on an emotional roller coaster; when things don't go your way you will feel deep low's of frustration. But when things are going your way you feel elation from the accomplishment of beating the odds.This game can be very hard, you need to be extremely quick in matching tiles. There is a sort of 'continual countdown timer' where if you do not match tiles quickly enough then your 'session' will come to an end. You can increase your session 'time' by creating a match 4 or 5 of certain tiles or by eating food. On the other hand, if enemies hit you then your 'time' will decrease.The style of 'matching tiles' in this game is similar to 'Puzzle Kingdoms' except in this game you can slide as far as you like along the entire row or column.You will fail alot in this game especially at the harder difficulties as the odds are stacked against you. But 'winning' every play session is not how this game works. You just take each 'play session' as far as you can; you will earn resources and experience every play session which you keep regardless. You spend this upgrading your dwellings, weapon, armor, spells, equipment, etc. So the idea is that you are playing the game for the match 3 puzzle/challenge and just let the progression happen in the background naturally.I feel this game is more for an advanced or veteran match 3 puzzle player and will not be friendly to new comers of the genre."

Fight your way through hordes of monsters, while using your puzzle skill to kill them off. Who knew one day that puzzles would be the bane of dragons.Game play: 7The game play is solid. You start off in a stone room with broken down doors everywhere, that leads into other rooms. With these rooms, you are able to increase your static, from better armor, to better spells, to better score multipliers, to more damage. To be able to unlock each door you must run the ongoing dungeon to earn experience to gain levels and to gain gold. While running the dungeon you are given a Bejewel style puzzle game. On the top of the screen you have the character running, He’ll run into monsters, doors, and chest. That you need to match up the squares to progress further into the dungeon. You are given a time limit. You will slowly be pushed backwards to the left edge of the screen. The faster you kill monsters or unlock things the closer you get to the right side of the screen. Once you pass a certain threshold on the screen you will gain a bonus to your score as long as you keep moving ahead. Each Square has an icon that you need to match up to be able to kill monsters or unlock chest or doors. Each icon has special ability to help you progress deeper. The icons you see are, Wood, Boulder, Wand, Sword, backpack, key and shield. Wood and boulder give you materials to use to build the rooms you see at the start. Wand and sword are attacks depending on the monster they can be either be weaker or stronger vs the type you are using. The backpack can give you items to use in your inventory on the right side of the screen. The key is used to open chest and doors, the shield gives you better armor to take hits better.On the side, you have you’re inventory where you get power ups, From faster moment, to magic attacks, to keys and weapons. They can be very useful. After you die you are able to use the gold and materials you gained from the previous run to build the rooms, or you may hold on to them until next time. The overall object of the game is to get your score to 10,000,000 (Ten million). To be able to escape.Story: 2There isn’t really a story going on here. You are a guy who looks like Indiana Jones who has become trapped in this dungeon that is now trying to escape. Having to fight zombies, demons, dragons and such. That’s pretty much it. This game doesn’t really need much of a story to really enjoy it.Graphics: 6This game takes on the retro 8-bit style. Like many other indie games that uses 8-bit. They are pretty simple as it is. The mix of colors being used range from grays, to lighter colors like reds and blues. It’s a simple pallet of colors over all. The graphics don’t pop out as anything to flashy to it. they are Kinda of flat graphics. In its own right the graphics are decent.Music: 5Like the graphics it takes on an 8-bit sound track. The music is decent sounding but not amazing but yet not horrible either. It does keep in decent pace with the game play. Other than that there isn’t really much else to the music.Final Though:Overall I enjoyed this game a lot. It was fun, and challenging. I found the game play being the best part of this game. However this game kinda of lacks any real re playability. It’s a game that is great for a one time play and not touch it for a while. This game doesn’t stand out to other puzzle games. However the unique thing about this game is the RPG element which gives it a nice touch. Having the Bejewel style puzzle being what you use to fight monsters and unlock stuff with does give this game the bit of edge it needs to push it higher than your average puzzle game. With the mix of gaining gold and materials and being able leveling up to unlock more powers to make you stronger does make this game fun.If you are a puzzle person or someone who simply loves Bejewel like myself you may want to try this game out. If anything this game is cheap so for a few bucks you can’t go wrong with this game.Final Score: 6Check out my Tumblr for more!www.rogue32807.tumblr.com"

Sword and staff tiles will damage your enemies, wood and rock tiles will help you build your castle, backpack tiles can give you items and shield tiles will give you a shield (did you expect anything else ?).

Your character progresses in a dungeon and you match blocks together in order to keep on moving, matching keys to open a door or chest, swords or shields to fight. The game is a race against time. It's quite fast paced and easy to get into, though hard to keep going and finish it. The RNG can sometimes really screw you up - and you may need to reset a level just because you didn't get what you needed for a long time. It's satisfying to see the big numbers appear, and each shake of the screen when you match blocks is pretty cool.You need to reach the score 10,000,000 in order to complete the game, and all the runs beforehand allow you to buy upgrades such as potions, weapons, gear, score accumulators in order to improve your score further, get better upgrades - until you're good enough to hit the top score to beat the game.You can collect four items that stay with you even when a run fails, to make future runs easier. It can get really fraustrating, since even if you have every single upgrade, getting the final score is still difficult. However that also makes it fun! The music also helps a lot to get you more stressed.Visually the game at times make it hard to see what's going on, especially when managing your position in the game. The character screen is small. On the left of the main ""running"" screen is a skull, on the right is a finish line and a smily face. If your character is at the right of the screen, it's harder to counter a threat since you don't see it until it's already on you. If your character is on the left of the screen, you'll die a lot faster if you don't get the block combination you need to open a door, since your run ends if the skull catches up with you.Pros and ConsPro'sAddictiveChallenging/Fast pacedGood musicFun system to work withConsAddictiveChallenging/Fast PacedMUSIC MAKES YOU STRESSEDRNG hates youThe screen doesn't moveTL'DROverall VerdictI recommend this game to other people.

It's a match 3 puzzle game (but instead of swapping two tiles, you move an entire row or column to match, so it'll take a bit to get used to), but instead of leaving it at that adds in some RPG and combat elements to keep things interesting. In short, you make runs to escape a dungeon (which happens at 10,000,000 points - spoilers!) by matching tiles; sword and staff tiles do damage to enemies you run into, key tiles open locked chests and doors, backpack tiles give items that aid you along the way, and wood/stone are resources you use to upgrade rooms in the initial area you start in. At the end of the day it's still a match 3 puzzle game, so if you're not into that this probably won't do anything to change your mind, but the system of progression it uses to keep things interesting is great. Relatively short, I guess, considering it has a definitive end, but you can keep playing after the end for more upgrades/higher scores. It kept me entertained long after completion on iOS and the PC version will likely do the same."

That's the gameplay beyond the tile-matching based upon what you need to get you through the obstacle you're currently encountering at the top of the screen whether it be a monster, chest, or door. I feel like too much is expected of this title for absolutely no reason. It's a game worth the about $0.99 you'll likely pay for it and can be a quick way to pass a bit of time while your buddy walks the dog and takes out the garbage before you get back to DotA 2, TF2, etc. It's got a somewhat satisfyingly simple play that, while sometimes awkward with the mouse, doesn't frustrate simply because you aren't playing because you're 'so into it,' you're playing because you need a time sink that you can put down and pick up. For what the game's worth I'd give it a 6/10."

Your object is to arrange the tiles in groups of three or more in order to eliminate the tiles, gain a bonus, and have more tiles drop into the field of play.In my opinion, You Must Build A Boat (YMBAB) -- which is by the same developer -- is exactly like this game and is much better.  If I had bought this game before YMBAB I might have liked it more.  But, unfortunatley, it suffers from the fact that the two games are essentially alike.I have read other reviews that describe this game (and its other incarnation) as adventures in grinding.  This is true.  To be honest, I had enough of grinding when I played WoW for seven years.  I'm tired of grinding.  It's pointless and those moments of my life are more valuable then to keep edging toward some arbitrary goal -- in this case, ten million points.I always have a questionable amount of fun playing games that are laregly influenced by luck.  Perhaps I am not good at thinking visually in three dimensions and, therefore, I'm not able to plan and strategize well in this type of game.Even YMBAB suffers from this influence of luck.  Ultimately, you can move tiles as quickly as you want or need to, but if you don't get the right tiles dropped into place then it you're eventually doomed.  Therefore, it really doesn't matter how well you make decisions, how fast you operate, or what your strategy is.  Eventually, you will succeed just because of the forces and fates of luck.I did enjoy this game -- but to be clear I don't think you need to own both this and YMBAB and YMBAB offers more compelling interest.  There just wasn't enough positive happening here when I succeeded to compel me to continue.Buy either this or YMBAB but not both."

The game is a little bit Bejewled and little like Puzzle quest with a super short timer. The gameplay is a match 3 type game so its easy to pick up and play.Thats also probably its greatest failing is its got one trick and it plays it over and over again. Now like I said the gameplay is fun but thats all you do in this game is go the dungeon that generally lasts around 2 minutes or less and then once you have finished inside the dungeon then get better gear and head towards the dungeon. Thats it.I do have advice for what I love to see in a sequel if there is one. Skill levels for the clock as its super fast and games are super short. Make the dungeon a little bit more different the further down you go besides the different bad guys. Add torches or rocks or make it a different background color so you realize your in a different dungeon.

,Not Recommended,227580,9148353,"Posted: 16 February, 2014",all,"Classtoise, PUNCH KING","10,000,000 is one of those rare games that tries to mix RPGs, autorunners, and puzzles.It's one of the many that completely fails to be any good at all 3.First, the RPG elements are clunky. They explain it once, but then give you little to no way to actually improve. You'll always fight monsters the same way with the same spells. And considering the barebones graphics, music, and the looming end, it adds virtually nothing to the gameplay other than an annoying distraction and an indicator of what you now need to match.Secondly, the autorunning nature feels more like an arbitrary way to make it difficult without ever having to change anything on the field or in the game. A vague ""end"" keeps chasing you. When it reaches you or passes you or some other vague idea of ""you reach it"" that seems to change from game to game, you lose. Except you can keep matching for a few seconds.And then there's the puzzle elements. They're, at best, clumsy. The game will not simply suggest a certain chain, it all but enforces it. See a skeleton? Get those staff and sword blocks. None of those? Fine, I GUESS get some resources. Oh there's a sword. Ignore that double/chained set, just get that sword or the looming end will get you! But that's not the worst of it. Oh no. The WORST of it, my friends, is that when you scroll it around the screen...it makes no difference if there are 3 blocks. They must be blocks that were initially placed in a way to complete a chain. If you scroll it around and there's 4 swords and you need four swords? Sorry, only the wood resource that had a 3 piece chain will count. Nothing else. This seems like a drastic oversight. Even the likes of Tetris Attack on the SNES would let you change blocks with no outcome, thus allowing a deeper gameplay. This offers no depth in that sense. It has to be already on screen, already apparent, and already set up.All of this combines to create a tedious but inoffensive puzzle experience. But what makes it truly heinous is how many times you repeat a level to complete challenges to get resources to unlock do-Hold on, champ! You flawlessly performed all those tasks, but you need 500 wood and 500 stone for the next door! You only have 300 wood and 120 stones! Nope, get back to the time sink.All in all, I cannot recommend 10,000,000. It is a clunky, rushed, and overall ugly game that seems to hope to garner more love off the Atari-era graphics than any actual quality or effort."

There is no story to speak of, the goal is to escape the dungeon/castle you find yourself locked into. You do this by getting a high-score of 10,000,000 or above. Sounds easy? It kind of is, the first times. This game get tough as nails when you try and beat it the forth time and beyond tho. This is something the game calls ""ace levels"" which basically is a NewGame+ mode that ramp up the difficulty progressively. The question is who is even going to want to play this game for that long with these awkward mouse controls? Anyway...The games single biggest problem is it's useless control scheme. I understand that there really are no good alternatives for games like this. (SO DON'T ♥♥♥♥ING RELEASE THEM ON STEAM!) The Steam version of 10,000,000 is not nearly as good as it's iOS counterpart. 10,000,000 is a touch screen handheld device game - and should not be anything else. It's atrocious to play this with a mouse. It's like night and day. This is a game that relies on quick inputs and mild planning how to arrange the table, and with this clumsy mouse ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t that's just not satisfactory.This is one of those games that are perfect in bite sized chunks - for when you are on the train or having a break at the job. If I play for more then 10-20mins in one go I quickly get bored. It's ""one of those games"".The good music (2 songs...) is still awesome and the gameplay is smooth and dandy on this version. It's just that you cannot get around the deal-breaker here. This should be operated with touch controls. Nothing else. I have not tried, but if I would guess I'd say this game probably is as good as it can be on a iPad.Mechanics....Match 3 or more of the same symbol from the board and you ""get"" that symbol as a attack on your enemies. A sword for instance is a physical attack. A staff is magical etc. There are symbols you can match and collect too like wood, gold and experience which is used to buy new skills and upgrade your castle/dungeon to improve physical/magical/skill damage output. Oh, and all of this has to go fast because the more you earn the faster the game wants you dead by throwing even more monsters at you. It gets pretty frantic later on. There is more to it but this is the basics.Final verdict....The iOS version 8/10. The Steam version 3/10"

The plot is simple, you wake up in a dungeon cell and as the title of the game implies, you escape the dungeon for good when you score 10 million points in a single run. The game plays like bejeweled in that the player shuffles tiles on a grid by dragging a row or column in order to make 3 symbols match. Successful matches yields attacks, magic, keys, items, gold and materials that you can use to improve your cell, converting it into a base of operations which provides better gear, perks and special potions. The gameplay is easily accessable and there is a method to process of running dungeons that might feel hectic and challenging but never really feels frustrating. An average dungeon run takes only a few minutes but you can run the dungeon as many times as you like before returning to your base. The graphics are simple and have a Commodore 64 quality to them and the chiptune music is nicely composed.10,000,000 is simple, fun, and addictive. Easy to pick up and play, yet challenging when you want it to be. The price is very reasonable and the game is not graphically heavy so you can play it on an older machine.

Every time, your goal is to meet the requirements so you can advance to the next dungeon, and fight tougher monsters for stronger items and more points.There are two main flaws - the first is that the game is rather short. The second is that there is a little too much based on luck; for example, you might have a screen with no keys and run into treasure chests and nothing else. Actually hitting 10,000,000 points at the end is mostly luck.Still, I've got to recommend this to anyone looking for a short, fun puzzle game."

,Recommended,227580,8992823,"Posted: 6 February, 2014",all,Moray,"Well well well, where to start with this game?Awhile back I heard about 10,000,000 and I was looking forward to getting my hands on it to play, after I got it, I spent 2 or 3 hours playing it nonstop, soon after my play session ended I relised I felt really weird,  so I tryed to stand up, and I felt so disorentated dizzy to almost the point where I felt intoxicated, I couldnt understand it.That aside, the time spent playing 10,000,000 has had its frustraitons, but it was very fun, what ever it may be, getting huge combos going, to the silly hints, everything about it brings such a retro feel, the music and audio compliments the game.In a nutshell, the top side scroller looking area of the screen is a cleverly disguised timer and health bar. Your character runs through a dungeon, and all of his actions are controlled by the blocks you match. Need to unlock a door or a chest? Match some keys. A monster blocking your path? Physical attacks are executed by matching swords while magical attacks fire off by matching staves. Standing still by not matching causes the timer to tick down, pushing your character to the left, and getting hit by monsters also pushes you to the left. The damage aspect can be mitigated by matching shields, which are absorbed instead of pushing your character. Fall off the side of the screen and it's game over.To supplement these mechanics are a set of shockingly deep loot, item, upgrade, and experience systems. Monsters can drop loot, and you can also get loot by matching backpack tiles or unlocking chests. Loot can either be gold to buy upgrades or actual usable items. A few items you'll come across are a red orb that'll damage whatever monster is in front of you, a key to instantly unlock a chest or doorway blocking your path, scrolls to spawn more tiles of a certain type on the board, and much more.Every time you start up your game and get ready to explore, your character lierally Jumps out of bed and is ready to rock, I first noticed the score and the goal, which reminded me of one of those Awful motivation posters that were en vogue in the 90's and acts like one too.You really need to think about the games mechanics, because 10000000 doesn't tell you much beyond the qwerky loading hits, and leave you on your own to explore, I find that this works perfecly with short playt sessions, and adds a sense of discovery that I found fun.If you have one of your 10,000,000 runs that lasts more than a minute or two you are doing considerably well, it gives you a chance to catch your breath and break down what you learned during your last attempt to reach your goal of 10,000,000.This is a game with a protestant work, and you have to Aceept failure as part of the Journey, and try your best to do a little better every time.I have really enjoyed my time so far playing 10,000,000 and I hope everyone else can have some fun with it too.I would rate 10,000,000 a:4 out of 5As it does what its intended too exactly as it should."

,Not Recommended,227580,8997616,"Posted: 6 February, 2014",all,Buckets,"This game is just sliding tiles. It tries to seem like more with the RPG elements but that is little more than a skin. The game rewards you for making as many matches as possible, as fast as possible, regardless of what is happening in the top section. Sure, you have to match the right tiles to proceed past each obstacle, but that happens naturally through frantic matching. If you try to play the board strategically you'll find things simply don't happen fast enough and you'll fail the level because time is always ticking down and you HP usually is too. The whole experience feels like it was designed by a gambling cartel trying to get me addicted to slots.The upgrade system was compelling at first but quite quickly became a chore and no longer enhances the experience after a few hours. There is a little strategic freedom in how you spend your resources on upgrades and perks but it really doesn't affect gameplay, it just shifts difficulty from one element to another. There is also an arbitrary wait while upgrades are occurring in which you can't do anything but watch the progress bar. This wait increases with each upgrade for no reason. It isn't long but it is completely unnecessary. The investment type perks are pointless because they effectively just adjust how much grinding is necessary and players won't know how much grinding they want to do until they've missed the opportunity for the investment to be economically viable. I honestly think they game would be better served by automating or removing the entire upgrade system and just implementing a few sliders so players can adjust how good they have to be at tile matching to not lose.The only thing which is still interesting after a few hours is the challenges. There are at most 3 challenges active at any time and new challenges aren't made available until space is made for them by completing an existing challenge. They are things like 'Kill an armored monster with only staves' and 'Open a chest within 5 seconds'. Challenges provide a reason to adjust strategy which helps stop the game becoming stale, however I'm fairly frequently stuck on (a) challenge(s) and the game stops being fun at all. Completing an overly difficult challenge is a relief, not a reward, because a combination of grinding and luck is what gets me there. An option to skip challenges would fix this but might reduce the worth of the challenge system.To put it simply, if you're expecting anything more from the game than a pretty good tile matching time-waster you might be disappointed. I think there is potential in the format but a lot more weight needs to be given to the RPG elements for me to enjoy this as a hybrid puzzle RPG and not just a puzzle game with a guy running at the top of the screen."

I'm slow since its a long time since I played a matching puzzle game, in fact I don't usually play these games.  But there is no learning curb within the game to ""train"" you.  With only a few ""levels"" supplied in the game it wasn't on sale at 80% I wouldn't have bought it since it rendered the game less then £1.All in all, this it is, a game thats good for wasting a few hours, that you'd be mad to buy at full price.Overall its enjoyable, but to ranked up some of the conditions to move onot the next dungeon means you at points must ignore what you dungeoneer is doing to execute a 3 or 4 match combo.  This means your game is risked being cut short suddenly mid-combo.  So while your fumbling around to find a 3 match keys, the clock is ticking and you might have to throw a 3 part combo to clear enough to hope some keys pop up.Ont he other hand, I will note when the game DOEs through the right combos and pacing out for you, suddenly you breeeze through it without challenge... Rendering it the same as any match puzzle game.... Only 10x more fustrating. Top it off, things like XP are WORTHLESS, you train everything so quickly within half an hour you can have bought the entire lot.  I've got 4,000+ XP by the time I reached Dungeon Crawlere and theres no use for it?  Might as well not be there.Ironically, the resource you need the most, money/gold/whatever is often harder to find. To the point finding it sometimes actually breaks the flow of the game.If the issues were fixed, I'd buy a sequell, yes, but based on first impression of this game... It would take a steam sale before I'd buy that too."
,Recommended,227580,9000176,"Posted: 6 February, 2014",all,Priestbilly,"I got this game on a whim during it's 0.99 cent sale. At the time, I was suffering from a very painful toothache, which was almost dehibilitating. I wanted something I could do that didn't require focus, so I figured I'd try this game. Two things of note; one, my estimate for not requiring focus was completely off-base. Two, I played it from install to near completion in one 5 hour sitting. My toothache was an afterthought. I have no more praiseworthy sentence than that.The concept is simple; it's a match-3 game. Even worse, it's my least favorite kind of match-3 game; a move has to end with 3 or more matching. Nothing akin to, say, Tetris Attack, where you could meticulously plot out an amazing chain, one block move at a time. So why would I recommend this game, even when the first two paragraphs of this review are faintly condemning it?Because it's amazing, that's why. It takes cue from other match-3 games with the simple but addictive gameplay, and then adds it's own finess to the mix. You're exploring a dungeon, and your actions are based on matching tiles. Clear 3 Key tiles to open a lock on a treasure chest, match 3 Sword tiles to swing a sword at an enemy, you get the idea. Run the dungeon as long as you can, slaying enemies, collecting loot, and get as far as you can. Strive for that 10,000,000-point mark.What makes this work so well is it's so frantic. At any given time, you're matching in the grid, while watching your inventory of special, one-shot items, while at the same time plotting for the next encounter. Fighting a dragon? Forget those keys, those wood, you need lots and lots of attacks. At a chest? Those swords do you no good, you're waisting them as only keys will open the locks. The most stressful moments for me were the time between encounters; ""I have a five-chain of attacks lined up, I hope it's not a chest or door next...""The game rewards you for each attempt, too. Clearing wood tiles and stone tiles give you those in currency form, you collect gold and EXP from felled monsters and opened chests, and you can refurbish and upgrade your impromptu-home with facilities. Not got enough 'umph' behind your swings? Upgrade your sword at the smithy.It's a repetitive cycle to be sure, but there's no greater joy than building up a horde of gold from your failed runs, pumping up your sword's destructive might, and then laying waste to enemy after enemy with your newfound strength. However, the cycle doesn't continue forever, and once you hit max, that's it. The game will get no easier from there, and all that's left is you and your 10m goal.It's certainly not without it's own flaws though. Early on, the runs are frantic and short. Very, very short. Even in the tutorial run, you won't completely grasp what's going on or even how to plan things out because it's ALREADY OVER. It takes running after running to finally get a feel for the game, and then it goes out of it's way to make you attempt sometimes rediculous maneuvers to advance. These goals include simple things (get a certain score, get a certain amount of EXP), to difficult without planning things (defeat a ranged mob in less than 5 seconds) to downright infuriating (use a scroll to get a triple clear in one shot, seriously? No amount of planning will get you that). These shortcomings I don't nessicarily say are the game's fault, rather, the intencely random nature of this brand of match-3 makes them far harder than need be.When all is said and done, it's welcoming enough for beginners (given some time to adjust), and has enough depth and breadth for hardcore gamers to get a good kick out of it. At 0.99 cents, this was a steal of a game. The full-fledged pricetag of 4.99 is still low for the enjoyment you'll get out of this game. Expect to clock in at least 5 hours of good, solid gameplay before completing, and based on how much the random number god loves (or hates) you, another 3 hours until 100% completion. Even then, it's just fun to do a quick dungeon tromp to burn some time and some dragons."

I think I'd be more disappointed if I'd spent more than that. It's an ok way to kill time, but unless you're really into the core mechanic of matching tiles, it's really just matching lots of tiles while numbers get bigger. You can buy stuff along the way to make the numbers get bigger more quickly, and there are sub-goals and achievements for getting your numbers big enough along the way, but there's not much substance to it. It does do what it says it does for the most part though, so there's that, aside from the mouse occasionally hitching when sliding tiles around, which I've heard works better in the mobile version (which is easier as a result).

,Not Recommended,227580,9096958,"Posted: 13 February, 2014",all,Fox,"6/10This game earns an ""A"" for being a clever blend of genres, but a ""D"" by poorly balancing them it makes the game repetitive, unrewarding, and leaving the player wanting for more.It is a really great concept and fun to play at first. If it was play tested to adjust the poor ""grinding"" curves, it could be an addictive smash hit.Problems and improvements:1. Resorces... The game has a great concept with harvesting materials to unlock new ""shops"" to upgrade your character, but wood/stone become obsolete as soon as these shops are all open (which can be done in the first couple hours of game play). Even worse are ""Experience Points"", which are only spendable at one store. You quickly buy all these upgrades in the first couple hours of gameplay, leaving you a lot of game play earning useless points with nothing to spend them on. Gold is the last to go. After you spend gold upgrading everything to its max, you find that you can't upgrade any farther, and you're still only in the first half of the game.- To fix this, the game needs more options for upgrades with a better price curve to make sure there is always something more to buy or upgrade. The game should be complete or close to completion before you run out of upgrade options in any rpg.2. Effectiveness... Upgrades, even when all are purchased in the first half of the game, do not do enough to make your character feel more powerful or effective. Grinding for upgrades is hard enough, but these upgrades should make even the worst player more effective at the game.Items, if used too early, will be wasted (The same goes for matches that are lined up too early). This is counter-intuitive, since every second counts. When approaching an enemy or chest, it would be great if your continuing multi-combo or clicked item was aimed at them instead of simply lost. Also, while just 4 keys in a row will take care of 2 locks, 4, 5, or more staff/sword tiles do little more than 3 against enemies.3. The Clock... The clock is also your health bar, which is fine and the shield idea makes it work well enough. However, there is far too much working against the clock and not enough helping it. You only gain a small amount of time back after defeating an enemy or unlocking a door/chest (or matching wood/stone with an upgrade), there is a lot that wastes time like combos, which continue to fire off leaving you helpless to act until they are done. These combos, while sometimes helpful, usually just eat time and give little back outside score (which is really only helpful in reaching the overall 10,000,000 to beat the game. Keep in mind, score is NOT cumulative, and is only there to let you know how close you are to getting to the end of the game). Chain combos and 4+ matches should offer a small time bonus as well.4. Luck factor. I have no problem with the Critical hit probability, but the luck of having the right combination of tiles in anything close to the right order to get what you need to match up in time is very random. I've had great runs where I've just had great luck, and blaze through every obstacle, and I've had luck where I lose on the first enemy due to this.5. Gear... There are unlockable potions you an use to trade one thing for another (i.e. 20% of wood/stone earned becomes gold but you earn 0 wood/stone ). These can be turned on and off. The rest of the gear, although upgradable, has no options like many RPGs do. It would be nice if you could buy upgrades for gear, but also swap them out for different effects (i.e. a staff that uses Freeze when it crits, or armor that has a lower effects against close range enemies but blocks ranged attacks, etc.).6. Curve... It could use a difficulty setting. Even if that meant just adjusting time limit, damage effects, etc.Not just that, the overall ""Grinding"" takes the fun out of the game.Final Verdict:- It's not worth $5. I got my copy on sale for $1 and had cash in my steam wallet from selling trading cards, so... it was basically ""free"". I wouldn't suggest it for retail price.- If it had the above adjustments made, It would be worth the $5, maybe even $10.- While it has great roots, and is technically a finished game, it really lacks the polish to make it feel like more than a ""free to play"" you'd find on NewGrounds.6/10"

To reach 10,000,000 points and escape the dungeon is your ultimate goal. So is the run worth it, or should you just pass this one up and find a new number to satisfy you? Let’s find out.This one will be short and sweet, like the game itself turns out to be. Well, maybe not so sweet as it does tend to end with you dying. Quite a lot in fact. The gameplay is the tried and true match-3 formula we all know and love. With some minor combat elements tossed in, of course. Match three or more swords or staves and you will do damage to your enemies. Beat them and you continue along your merry way and earn more points. Along the way, you will collect gold and various resources, which can be used to upgrade your weapons, magic, and armor. Upgrading these will in turn allow you to get further in your run, collect more gold, upgrade more, and so on. The end goal is to reach 10,000,000 points and earn your freedom.If you’re a fan of addictive match-3 games and enjoy some RPG-lite gameplay, you won’t go wrong with this one.

The game will reward you for playing well and mixing and matching the right tiles to kill the right enemies and gain resources to upgrade your buildings, which in turn allows you to upgrade your character even more.The game is somewhat lengthy with some hours of gameplay and features no stops in the flow, unless you get matched up against a boss monster, in which the game heavily punishes you for not being prepared nor fast enough to match the right tiles. The game can feel cheap sometimes shoving a boss monster down your hallway with only a few points to go to the next rank.The soundtrack is alright, but with only 3 songs, which may seem repetitive to some.

You got bags which will give you a item from time to time. You got attack tiles, Sword and Staff, which make you attack the enemies in front of you and depending of the enemies you're fighting it might be better to use physical attacks (Sword) or magical one (Staff). Shield tiles let you absorb a damage from the enemies. There's also a star tiles which basically can match with any other tiles.With the shop you can upgrade your gears, like your swords so you do more physical damage with sword tiles. You can upgrade your armor so enemies take more time to attack you. You gain experiences so you can unlock skills, like more chances for your magical attacks to make a abnormal status to the enemies. There's also potions that will handicap you so you can gain more points for exemple.The graphics are simple but got charms, the really big selling point to me is the music which is fantastic in this game.

With the low cost to buy in I took the plunge and I couldn't be happier with the decision.The game is primarily match-3, matching the tiles allows you to send your nameless dungeon crawler hurdling through the stone corridor towards his inevitable defeat to some combination of the hands of a nearby monster or a clock depending on how well things go for you. The simplicity of the gameplay makes it very interesting to play and progress through as you become better at finding and making matches.The game features RPG mechanics in the form of resource collection to boost the effectiveness of your matches. Matching swords and staves vs monsters will produce different results depending on what that monster is weak or resistant to as well as improving the overall power of each match. You can also unlock perks to be given to your hero permanently by spending earned experience, and temporarily through the use of the toggleable potions which change how some of the game mechanics work.Overall, if you like puzzles, racing against the clock, and mashing monsters, you'll likely enjoy 10,000,000.

It's not really the same other than the matching moves side to side, but it's the entire row or column instead of a single piece. Nonetheless the game is pretty challenging to get all the achievements, especially ""The Jose."" I was able to do it twice, but the first time did not register (others have had this issue as well), so it took me another 12hours to get it again. The game can be easily completed in seven hours to get all of the achievements. A drawback is that one does not realise they get their achievements unless they log off the game and then receive them on Steam.The game gets repetitive and leveling the weapon, staff, shield, and skills gets tedious. But it gets challenging when monsters get stronger along with you. Chance of getting good drops is also a large factor in success for this game.I would recommend this game if you like to get achievements and enjoy matching puzzle games.

You keep this up until you lose by the screen catching up with you, which then causes you to awake back in the stone chamber.You can spend the resources you find to open and upgrade the rooms which in turn boost your abillity to play the game,rinse & repeat until you get 10,000,000 score and you win the game, simple.There are milestones and challenges to complete that give you some resources and multipliers adding your end goal.All in all it's a short but addicting match-3, nothing amazing but simply solid in its execution."

It's a quick and dirty rogue experience.  Perhaps the largest departure from other rogue games is that you don't lose materials when you start a new run, so you're constantly accumulating.  This game seems to be balanced for this kind of system, though."

The graphics are simple, but that's part of its charm. The music is catchy but not invasive. There's actually a fair amount of strategy involved when you're going for the long haul. I only put one hour into the game on steam, but that's because I bought the game on my phone as well (available on Android and iOS) and then primarily played it there."

Each matching tile is having a different outcome. Sword and staves will damage the enemy. Keys are unlocking chests and doors. Wood and ores are needed to unlock new things at the hub. Shield is needed to reduce damage and make the run longer and the chest has a chance of giving you an item. Your end goal is to reach 10M in one RUN. You do have to upgrade yourself to make a run last longer. Once you have read the left side, your game will be over!Unlocking new things.Very easy game to understand.Repetitive but addictive.You can upgrade yourself by making your runs a little bit easier.Very interesting game!Could be short if you are doing really well.The 8 bit music is very well done! Including in Combat puzzle mode!There are challenges that you should be able to complete for rewards.Other things.If you are familiar with the game ""tetris attack"" on the Snes or ""Pokemon puzzle league"" on the N64. This game plays almost the same.-------------------I Give this game a 9/10"

It's a great game to kill a few minutes (hours) on, and all you need to do is make a cup of tea (Or whatever's your poison) and play the mouse-only game whilst sipping ones favourite beverage.Don't be put off by the simple graphics and simple gameplay, it's a game well worth the few £'s it's up for :)"
,Recommended,227580,15384466,"Posted: 15 April, 2015",all,Tanya,"This one is a 50/50.It's a simple, fast-paced match 3 game where you make matches based on the event presented to you. i.e. if your character comes to a chest, you match key icons to unlock it and move on. The longer you stand behind an obstacle without clearing it, you are pushed back until you eventually 'lose'.While playing you can match resource tiles which allow you to upgrade things on your ship, which pretty much just increases your damage, or defense, or something else that will allow you to travel further next time you adventure.The main problem with the game is that there is an artificial level of difficulty. You adventure for a certain amount of time, then you will inevitably reach a monster much harder than the previous ones which acts as a barrier to your progress until you unlock enough upgrades to move on. In other words, it doesn't really matter how well you play the game, you won't be able to go as far as you 'can'.Nevertheless I still kept coming to play it just because the main part of the game is very addictive."

After 8 hrs though I've upgraded everything to max and the incentive to carry on isn't there. the gameplay alone without the progess to reward you unfortunately isn't enough to keep me playing (and thats coming from someone who's been playing bejeweled blitz every day for 4 years). good while it lasted though.
