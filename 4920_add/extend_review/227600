I had high expectations for this modern reimagining of what is ultimately my favourite game of the Fourth Generation.PROS+Every level, every detail lovingly recreated and updated+Stunning art and music design+Smooth and responsive at 1080P/60FPS+Full controller support+Brilliant take on the old Mega Drive classic+Two music schemes to choose from (original soundtrack or modern soundtrack)CONS-Does not include the original 1990 game that is included with the retail console version. It's sad to see it missing from the PC release.-Three to eight hours to complete depending on how completely you explore each levelFor Disney fans, platforming fans, and fans of whimsy, this game is a buy!(Suitable for all ages and skill levels)Please hit the like button if you found this review at all helpful.  Thanks :D"

Jump on toys, throw apples at mushrooms, and platform like its 1990. This version doesn't just take your grandma's oldsmobile, and slap a new coat of paint on it and hang a few trees from the mirror; this gem is done from the ground up and is fantastic."

,Recommended,227600,33103610,Posted: 1 July,all,Vaagur,"Castle of Illusion is a great platformer game with Mickey Mouse as it's main character. You have to collect the rainbow gems in order to save Minnie from an evil witch and for doing so, you need to go through many worlds and kill their bosses to collect them.The game soundtrack is composed by the awesome Grant Kirkhope, the same pesron that did the OST for Banjo-Kazooie, Banjo-Tooie, Donkey Kong 64, Yooka-Laylee, etc... so well, obviously the music is fantastic! The graphics are using a lovely Disney style for them. As for the story, it was a little on the basic Disney side... but it wasn't bad at all.As for the gameplay, well it's good, there's just a few issues. The platforming is nice and the levels are interesting, but there's a few bad design ideas. First of all, in a game where you have gather collectibles, there shouldn't be parts where you are forced into a further part of the level and unable to go back. It makes having to restart the game really often when you want to gather all the gems on a certain level and it's truly annoying.Then there's the controls... I've played with a keyboard, I know the game is meant for controller, but still... In a certain level where you have to jump from cookies and I have no clue if this happens with a controller too, but it's just so wonky! I've had to retry this level multiple times because somehow, whenever I got close to the border of those cookies, I would try and jump and get stuck in an invisible wall as if it was meant to make it impossible to fall by jumping from cookie to cookie (they're over a deadly milkshake pool). But well, sometimes the barrier would work and sometimes it wouldn't, so if you weren't ready for it to work this time or whatever, you pretty much jump to your death every time.Then there's the feeling the last parts were rushed... The progression felt nice up to the last world or two, which felt really rushed to be honest. That and many unfair mechanics in the game... and some parts where you'd have to jump way down only to end up on a monster and die (just why?).Lastly, I don't think game with optional speedrun modes should have waiting included in their timing. I figured this the hard way when I tried to speed through the levels to find out that I had to wait for ropes to swing to my location no matter how fast I had gotten there...Other than that, the game is great and I suppose it will be easy to jump over it's flaws. If you're a perfectionist or an achievement hunter, the game should take you a good six hours to find all the collectibles and unlock everything, as well as finishing the game.But sadly, if you're just going through the game like a normal person and doing the strict minimum, I don't think the game would last much longer than 1 H... maybe 2H... It's mostly time consuming to do all the speedrun mode and collect everything, but the levels themselves are really short!"

I enjoyed this far more than the original Mega Drive/Genesis version, which itself was great fun.The level designs are so slick and some of the graphics (especially the candy/cake section) are fantastic. The remixed music isn't overly impressive, but you can choose the original tracks which is a nice touch. Also, the voice-overs grate (but can be switched off).It is just a shame the game is quite short and fairly easy, but to me is still worth buying even at full price (which I did)."

I love platformers, and I wanted to love this game. But I can't. It could have been great but it feels unfinished.ConsMy biggest complaint is that it is not fun to play. The enemies are designed almost exclusivly as gotchas so that you have to replay the levels until you remember where they all are. The character controller (the controls) is total garbage. Virtually every other platformer you have played have better controls. Rayman, Guacameele, Mario, SMB, you name it. The controls here are floaty, the hitboxes are bad, the enemy positions deliberatly mean. There are plenty of other niggles mostly related to polish, but those are the main ones. The game is also really /really/ short.ProsWhat this game has is beautiful level design with a great atmosphere. There were hints of magic that brought me back to being a kid. There are nice voiceovers.This game should have been epic. But it has been let down by bad controls and lazy mob placement, probably done to make the game longer than it is."

There's no consistency with jumps- how high, how far, he moves back and forth before landing, etc.  In a platformer, moving and jumping is all you have.  This game is too frustrating for me to play.  Even on the very beginning levels, the controls are too frustrating to get basic jumping mechanisms.  It does say it's better with a game controller, so maybe my problem is I was trying to use a keyboard.  Still, that's no excuse for having a game that's so frustrating to play it isn't fun."

It blends 2D sidescrolling platformer, and 3D platforming into a near seamless experience that manages to incorporate elements of old and new into a wonderful experience.Now, it might seem ""easy"" at first, but let me tell you, that like any 2D platformer of the time, this is quickly thwarted once you get to the later levels. If you want to get EVERYTHING, it's going to cost you. Some of the later levels, like the library and the castle, are most definitley a test of what you've learned throughout this adventure.The boss fights are mostly just pattern memorization, as there is no randomness that would otherwise make it harder, and they're all on set patterns. As long as you memorize what order a boss does something, you should be fine.Overall, if you want a fun platforming experience, and want to just have a quick romp, give this a spin."

In addition to distinct ""themes"" on different levels, there are level design concepts that make levels less monotonous (e.g. sublevels in area that can turn upside down, switch of perspective). Having said that, it has very annoying controls, and even with the controller it's rather difficult to do precise actions due to loose movement and jumping lag. This is IMHO a very serious problem given the nature of the game. Made worse since the level and boss fight design includes many areas that require precise movements and have instant-death possibilities. I'd say that this combination of control issue and level design issue contributes to much of the ""playtime"", given that the levels themselves are actually not that long.I bought this game at 75% off, and even at this price I think there are other games that offers better value for money. Not recommended at all at full price. It's really unfortunate since given the quality of other aspects this could have been a very nice game."

It is not a port from the old genesis version (and I would have preferred it was ) and sometimes you have to walk around the 3d environment.

What I like the most is that they stuck to the original game and upgraded it a notch in its Level Design. The only problem I had with it was the floaty controls and it isn't such a good idea to have that in a platformer. Especially when it switches from a 2D sidescroller  to a 3D platformer.

I'd definitely reccomend this game to any of my friends, and everyone else for that matter. It does have a short play through time, so you might want to catch it durring a sale if that kind of thing matters to you.

And I'm not talking the newfangled sort of platformer that's all about being mercilessly difficult by putting spikes everywhere. This is a real, genuine classic-style platformer, and it's fantastic. If you've played the original, it's worth getting for how much they've changed from the Genesis version. There's new levels, new bosses, the old levels have been expanded upon, or even changed completely.If you haven't played the original Castle of Illusion, there's a lot here if you like 2D platformers. The platforming itself is really well done, and the game itself never gets unfairly hard. In fact, it's pretty easy up until the final stages, where you might have to spend a couple of continues. There's also a few parts where the game goes into 3D, which never last for long, but are used for a lot of interesting level setpieces. It also looks fantastic, although the new soundtrack is sadly pretty generic. Personally, I prefer the classic soundtrack, but that's just me!Basically, if you want a platformer that's made the way that platformers USED to be, go for this."

This resulted in areas within the game that took longer to complete due to game engine ""hiccups"" that completely threw my timing off (sure, blame the game engine ;)  ).

When Minnie Mouse gets kidnapped by the evil Mizerabel, it's up to Mickey Mouse to venture into her Castle of Illusions, collect the Rainbow Gems to defeat Mizerabel, and save Minnie. The game is a simple platform game that combines 2D and 3D gameplay. You jump and throw objects to defend yourself against Mizerabel's minions. It's colorful graphics, wonderful music, and fun gameplay is what makes the game shine. There are a lot of secret passages and specific items to collect which will unlock artwork, statues and costumes. The only thing I don't like is that the narrator can sometimes be annoying as he narrats througout the entire game, but other than that, Castle of Illusions is a fantastic remake. Being more familer with platforming games I found this to be somewhat of a breeze, with it's share of difficulty. Course I'll be kept busy if I decide to complete the game 100%.

Even buying their good games supports bad practices.If you don't care whether you support DRM that may repeatedly force you online for re-validation; or make games that use it eventually cease to work for all legitimate owners; or you only care about this particular piece of software then it's safe to ignore the preamble & ""score"" of this review. I believe the rest of its contents are fair criticism.Buying any of Sega's products, even older ones that lack that DRM like this one does, will support the inclusion of said DRM in future products. As someone who does a lot of gaming offline I can't support a company which does that.You won't even be supporting the developer because Sega apparently shut the studio that made this remake down as soon as it was finished; and Disney more than likely take most of the profit anyway.If that doesn't bother you, again, feel free to ignore my preamble and ""score"".---This is a decent remake of the classic 2D platformer, with occasional 3D segments thrown in at random, but it has issues with running at a decent framerate. It's very happy to cap itself at 30fps for seemingly no reason. It was initially capped at 30 intentionally, as it was on console, but a patch was supposed to fix it to cap at 60.It has a slight feeling of being unfinished, or perhaps just overly simplified for children. Many segments are optional challenges in a stage which reward you with a collectible upon completion; but if you fall in a pit that would’ve killed you in a normal stage you merely respawn near their entrance. Some of them are mandatory to attempt but will let you progress immediately upon your first failure so the speedrunning trick is to “die” on purpose.A lot of these segments look like you were supposed to clear them before progressing in a stage, given the changes that have taken place in the main stage upon your return to it.You now need a certain amount of collectibles to progress through the game. This was somewhat a factor in the 8-bit versions since I think you could technically miss 2 of the rainbow gems & needed all 7 to unlock the final stage. I’m fairly sure the 16-bit original was entirely linear.Collectible hunting works more like a Banjo Kazooie kind of platformer here, since there’s hundreds of clear gems to collect, but it’s never hard to find enough gems in levels to carry on. It wouldn’t surprise me if the developers were aiming for a sort of Banjo Kazooie feel since they even brought Grant Kirkhope in to compose the remake’s soundtrack.The original 16-bit soundtrack is also included as an option but doesn't fit some of the redesigned levels that are far longer than some of these music tracks were intended to play for. The first stage's apple chase is a particular example.I see no good reason that the 16-bit version couldn't have been included as it was with PS3 pre-orders or at least sold on Sega's crappy emulator hub thing, even if it had to be at a higher price than the other games on it. Sega clearly worked something out with Disney both to make this remake and to release the original on PS3.I'll at least grant that this remake has far fewer issues than Capcom/Wayforward's Ducktales Remastered does on pretty much every format.

Cool as in ""above ok"". Truth be said, it could be amazing if they used the GameGear/Master System version as template, instead of the - sorry purists - ♥♥♥♥♥♥ Genesis version, which at the time was a game with the only purpose of promoting the newborn Sega Genesis with its good looks. It was 1990 after all, the beginning of the legendary 16-bit generation.So anyway, they're basically a re-imagining of those levels, which thank god made them better in the end (which wasn't such a hard task after all).In the end, I have to say it's a game made for the fans of the original. There's no denying it.New players will find it, unless they are REALLY open minded, too damn short (one can finish in a little more than 2 hours) and overall too easy and simple. Like I said, made for kids.The magic is there for sure, both for new players and old onse, but to be quite honest, it's value resides more in being a piece of nostalgia from the old days than anything else. Something that only the veterans of the original (btw, we are ♥♥♥♥ing old now, I hope you realize it :) ) will have.But despite all that, I still don't think the game is worth its full price.If we assume the game is on a reasonable discount (more than 50%) I would evaluate it as a 6/10 game for new players. For veterans, 8/10.Thanks for reading."

While there is generally only one path, it goes in all directions and never feels like you're just going in a straight path from left to right. I never played the original Genesis version so I don't know how closely it follows it but I understand this is more a reimagining than a remake. I know that I do like the variety of platforming and contrasting styles and designs of each level. The transitions from 2D to 3D gameplay generally flow well and it's easy to re-orient yourself to play the short 3D segments. Missing a jump usually does not lead to instant death but is often just a setback as you land in an earlier part of the level. I personally appreciate this as someone who hates bottomless pits. The bosses are also fairly fun to beat if again a bit easy. There is a bit of a challenge in getting all the gems as some are carefully hidden and require exploring off the obvious path. I generally dislike collect-a-thons but since the game is not too long and there are not too many gems, it was actually interesting to try and get all the gems without looking up a walkthrough.Graphics and music are very well done. The graphics do not obscure any platforms but give life and personality to each level. I particularly like the overall relaxing tone of the music, which gives a whimsical fairy tale feel while still being interesting to listen to. The occasional narration that occurs due to certain actions is also a nice touch.As a fan of 2D platformers, I found this to be a very enjoyable and imaginative game. Maybe it could have used another world with a few levels but what we got was high quality where replaying levels is not a chore."

Everything that was great about the original, the locations, the sense of whimsy had been successfully carried across to this new version along with a fully orchestral soundtrack and a friendly sounding narrator adding the level of Disney gloss that just wasn't possible in the cartridge era.

,Recommended,227600,15867877,"Posted: 17 May, 2015",all,manfromthewall,"Castle of Illusion is a remake of the 1990 Sega Genesis classic, which was considered one of the better Mickey Mouse games in the 16-bit era. I've played the original before, but far later in life, so I probably do not have the same level of nostalgia others may have with the game. Still, seeing as there was a remake out, I was curious on how the game would be reimagined to today's standards, and tried the new one out.Story:It's a very basic ""rescue the damsel-in-distress"" kind of story, with the damsel being Minnie Mouse, and the protagonist being Mickey. The main villain is a witch named Mizrabel, who looks like the evil queen from Snow White, and who is trying to steal Minnie's beauty. So, the game's story won't blow your mind, but given that it's a remake of an old Genesis platformer, it's passable.Gameplay:Castle of Illusion plays as you'd expect a traditional 2D platformer to play, for the most part. You try to reach the end of the stage, hopping on different platforms, and defeating your enemies by jumping on or throwing projectiles at them. Mickey controls really well, and despite the simple platforming mechanics, there is enough variety in the level design to definitely keep you interested in progressing from level to level. They did remove the butt-stomp from the original game, though, which is odd to me (why make the game even simpler?).In addition to the 2D platforming from the original game are the 3D platforming sections. This is mostly seen in the hub world of the game, and in some of the boss battles. Unfortunately, the 3D platforming in this game are the parts I dislike the most, as jumps to platforms away and towards the screen are far to imprecise for me to judge. As a result, I found levels like the Dessert Factory to be far more cumbersome to play through than the rest of the game (which, admittedly, was quite easy). This game definitely could have gone without these 3D platforming sequences, as much of the game was already a 2D platformer, anyway.Music:This game, being a remake, borrows a lot of music from the original classic. The main difference in the score, however, is that it was now composed by Grant Kirkhope of Banjo-Kazooie fame. Thus, the songs from the original now have a different feel to them, being more whimsical, and more fairy-tale like (in other words, they now sound kind of like they came from Banjo Kazooie). Given that this game's story is the typical damsel-in-distress flavor, I felt this was a very fitting change. As usual, Kirkhope's compositions were very fun to listen to while playing this game, and was probably the biggest thing keeping my interest in this game.Presentation:Graphics-wise, this game does its job in showing off its colorful worlds, and definitely looks like a typical Mickey Mouse CGI cartoon would look like. Often, you'll see background events as you're playing (like an upcoming boss moving catching up to you from the background), making the game's environment look much livelier than the original game. I thought was a nice touch.In addition to all this, this game has some pretty good voice-acting. There is a narrator who will give the player some insight to the story during the beginning of levels as the game progresses, giving the game more of the storybook feel. Mickey and Minnie, as far as I know, have their original voice actors acting as them, as well.Conclusion:At its core, I only thought this game was just good, but not great. The 2D platforming was very fun, but the 3D platforming segments really miffed me. I would say this is one of the games where the the soundtrack was the best aspects of the game, so I'd say definitely give it a listen. If you do find this game on sale, though, I'd say give it a shot, especially if you were a fan of the original game."

However in Castle of Illusion I wanna collect all the diamonds, statues and everything. The challenge is really fun. For the hardcore people, maybe you will think that the game is too easy, but you have to remember that to finish the original you had to finish the game with just one playthrough and you couldn't save. That was the true challenge on that time. This Castle of Illusion was re-built to  be actual and I prefer this way. I don't have the same time I had before to finish a 2D plataform with just one playthrough.

Now, I'm not sure if that was apart of the original game, but the rainbow bridge to confront the final boss almost reminds me of Ocarina of Time going into Ganon's Castle. Also, collecting the diamonds also reminds me of Banjo Kazooie opening the Note Doors. I'm not saying the game is copying those titles, but it reminds me of it; heck it might've even been in the original, but I haven't a clue if it does. I also forgot to mention that the narrator is the same guy who plays Victor Sullivan from the Uncharted games!Verdict:I might be a little biased here due to being able to play as Mickey friggin' Mouse, so just read on how I think Castle of Illusion is a really fun game. I personally have never played the original game, but I guess as a gamer who enjoys platform titles this game caught my attention even more so. I might not have had the best experience due to have a really low end PC (even lower than the minimum requirements), but it was still enjoyable. I bet it's even better when you're running on a better rig than my own. Everything in this game has that Disney charm and I greatly appreciate that as a guy who grew up watching Disney movies and cartoons. Due to only have played this version of Castle of Illusion I don't have much complaints except that the controls could feel a lot smoother (reading other peoples reviews that seems to be the most common complaint).Extra:I've personally only beaten the first area of the game, and from checking out other reviews for the game apparently it is about 2 hours long.

You dont get the nostalgica feeling, but it is ok for a quick platformer game. Dough I must say it is not an easy game. The controls are sensitive and the jumping is a bit out of control sometimes.The main downer must be not able to skip through some points in the game. The last boss is hard and you need to know what do do in every event, meaning afew attemps of replays to get it right. And hearing the same dialoge before the battle is the one that create frustration.The seccond downer is the item detail. Finding all Crystal was hard in the original game, but here it is even harder. There are areas you cant go back, and if you miss some crystals or worse (card or throphy) you have to replay the whole map collecting all over again. And as always there are 30-40 very hidden crystals in each map making it really hard to collect all. Most of the times i ended up missing 2-3 crystals. So annoying. Should be able to play the map again with all the crystals except those missed.The pro is the gameplay really. The maps are great and it is alot of fun playing through the game 1 time. Replay value.... not so much.I recommend this game if you want to play a semi hard platformer for a few hours.

However, Castle of Illusion is tons of fun to play! If you're a Disney fan like I am, then you'll love controlling Mickey through this little adventure. What a fantastic remake! For fifteen bucks? Not a dissappointment and I know that I'll be playing this over and over again :) Time Trial is a nice little touch as well!!"

Having played the original, I'm definitely biased to liking the game as it's an improvement upon an nostalgic experience. Still, it's a nice little platformer that shows how simple and short games used to be, before the era of 90's CRPGs and Playstation 1 games."

The only con is that the game is short, but while you play it you will surely enjoy yourself and become a kid again (if you´re not one) ;)"

It is a really fun platoform game, the graphics are crisp and clean, the controls are good and responsive, the music really helps set the mood.All in all, if you like platform type games, you will love this one.  The only issue might be the length, but I felt like I had a blast with it despite how short the game felt."
