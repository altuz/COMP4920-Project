Clocking in 200 hours with the likes of aCrusader Kingsor aEuropagame is easy for me to do, but at the 18th hour mark I decided this is simply a flawed game concept.  The problem is that thegame engine that Paradox uses so well covering their other grand strategy games does not scale very well when applied to the limited time frame of a Napoleon era game.  Nowhere is this better seen than in the process of battles.  The somewhat generalized battle system may be fine for a game that covers hundreds of years, but a game that only covers decades demands a more involved/detailed battle system.  They make an attempt by allowing you to choose battle tactics for example, but you never get the feel for the difference as the battle zips by, typical in Paradox games.  Napoleon's never ending pursuit for the definitive battle never feels fully realized.  The player is left wanting more once the battle engages.  The game desperately needed a sub system - or mini game if you will - that allows the player to engage in some tactical choices in the battles.  In this way the building of the army and the choices you made in unit structures feels more important.  And honestly, some of the other things so important and necessary in a long time frame game just seems like a distraction here.  The diplomacy and coalition building system holds promise, but in practice seemed more tedious to me than fun or interesting.  Once again, the engine that makes history dabbling sandbox play fun just does not scale as well in a game covering less historical time.I really hope they take another shot at the era but next time take the time to design or better modify the game engine to better reflect the uniqueness of the simulation."
76561197987502759,Recommended,227760,9344133,"Posted: 4 March, 2014",all,MCPaddyB,"For fans of the Total War series who like looking at the bigger picture. Or an excellent entry level Paradox Interactive grand strategy game.When I bought the game I was a complete Paradox Interactive noob but I always liked the idea of their truly-grand strategy games. However, having played the demos for Europa Universalis III and Hearts of Iron II, I was convinced I would never be able to get my head around the complexities of Paradox's games. This all changed with March of the Eagles. The era in which the game is set is right up my street and the scale of the campaign map was like nothing I'd experienced before ('scale' is a relative term here).People familiar with strategy games will be fimiliar  with the basic concepts here. You destroy your enemies and take their land, simple. However, in MotE the immediate gains (land) you make are much smaller than those in other games such as the Total War series. This may sound boring to some but I assure you the opposite is true. Because you have to fight harder for every inch, when you eventually destroy a nation it is all the more satisfying.Every nations on the map is playable from launch (no DLC is a rarity these days) which adds replayability to the game. I had the most fun playing as a lesser nations and working the larger powers against each other. Personally I recommend one of the Italian nations.Educational and fun!?!?!What suprised me is what youlearnwhile playing this game! If history/national geography interests you then this game is great. I can now name a lot of lesser Germanic/Burgundian nations such as Nassau and Hessen which I didn't know once existed. There are also event pop ups which add little to gameplay but provide educational fun, such as I never knew that Napoleon named his brother the King of The Netherlands. Fun fact!Diplomacy:The diplomacy element and associated AI is not the greatest in any game ever to be honest but it does the job perfectly well. There is a 'coalition' mechanic in this game which is a unique concept as far as I am concerned. This basically means that you and a bunch of other nations rally behind a super-power (Prussia, Austria, Russia, Ottomans, French or British [and Spain, but not really]) to defeat another super-power which results in an unbreakable alliance. This is a nice idea and historically relevent and probably the best feature in the game.Combat/War:Let's be honest. You auto-resolve most of the battles when playing Total War and that's why you're here.Basically the meat and potatoes of the game. If you're not planning on going to war there is not much point in playing the game. There are no live battlefield engagements in the style of Total War or Age of Empires but frankly they are not needed. While nine times out of ten combat boils down to who has more men, there are still other elements that effect the outcome in subtle ways. There are a variety of units avaliable to build but they are essentially pictures which represent statistics. But specific army composition is not necessarily what the game is about for me (though the right balance helps). For me it is not the who, but the where and when.... and also who a bit. Having the right amount of men in the right place at the right time is how you are going to win, not by numbers and blitzkrieg tactics. Also, with the exception of Russia and the Ottomans, you are not going to survive alone.You need friends.When you build an epic alliance as Britain with Naples, Prussia, Bavaria and Piemonte against the French this is where the game shines. It's even more fun to watch all those nations instantly turn against you for their personal gain as soon as the war is over. In this respect the game is extremely Machiavellian, and I love it!The combat is further complicated by the need to balance resources such as money and manpower. Compared to other Paradox games this level of resource management is childs play, but it is still on a par with other conventional RTSs.Famous historical characters such as Horatio Nelson and Napoleon make cameos which is a nice touch. They come with combat bonuses and can lead you armies/navies.Graphics:Acceptable. There is not a lot to be said here as the game essentially consists of a map and a few character models. It looks nice, don't get me wrong, but it is what it is. If you're going to be persuaded either way by graphics for a game like this you're probably in the wrong place. Be warned, there are a lot of menus but that is fine. You find your way pretty quickly.Sound/Music:The sound effects are passable to the point of being simply passive. Again, there is not much to report. Music on the other hand is where Paradox always delivers and this game is no different. It feels thematic but also extremely epic. The music adds further grandeur to the game which may not exist otherwise.Conclusion:The way Steam works the chances are this game will come up in a Steam sale soon enough. If it drops below £10 ($13ish) and it sounds like it might be your thing just get it and blame me if you're disappointed. I doubt you will be. If you want to get into Paradox grand strategies but don't know where to start then this is the one for you! It's simple enough to pick up easily but deep enough not to be considered a glorified tutorial for the other games, yet it introduces you to the essentials of Paradox grand strategies. For me it was a gate way drug and now Paradox is one of my all time favourite game developers.The downside. To be brutally honest after playing Crusader Kings II and Victoria II, among others, I don't see why a seasoned Paradox fan would buy this if they don't already own it. It brings nothing new to the grand strategy table. It was so good for me because it was my first expericence with the genre but if you know the genre already then there is little for you here. It's good, yes. But there are other Paradox games which are better (the aforementioned Crusader Kings II is my favourite so far).Arbitrary numbersFor the uninitiated Paradox virgin: 8.5/10 (buy at any price)For the Paradox veteran: 6.5/10 (buy at a reduced price)"

With one exception , this is a game you can pickup quickly and move into battle / conquest mode with minimal reading / tutorials.  The tutorials are there and cover every feature in detail should you need them.Pick your country wisely when you play this game.  Starting off on the wrong side will test your patience and mettle for battle.  I started as Great Britain and ruled the seas...but those pesky French kept drawing my ships and transports into battle.  I would end up winning but these spoiler attacks slowed me down a lot.  Enemy AI is competitive at the strategic level and in combat.The one daunting task is understanding the military units.  You can make upwards of twenty different types of land combat units in MoE.  TWENTY.  Knowing the difference between a Marine brigade and a Dragoons brigade is a must.  Knowing that armies, during that time, needed supply trains as much as they need fighting brigades is a must.  Knowing how to position your troops and their fronts for maximum effect is a must.  Put too many troops in a single front and you incur an attack penalty!Given the narrow slice of history involved, MoE is probably a niche strategy game.  Still, I'm very, very happy with my purchase.  If you play Hearts of Iron III, Crusader Kings II, and / or EV IV, you should add this game to your collection."

,Not Recommended,227760,17562026,"Posted: 15 August, 2015",all,PG908,"This game has some really great potential, but there are a lot of issues holding it back that really hurt the experience.Firstly, the AI. It's ridiculously grabby and cares little about what it's grabbing. France, for example, can and will take anything from stripes (yes, stripes) of sweden and finland (problematic for obvious reasons) to a chunk of northern portugal, while England, meanwhile, is happy to take Norway, Hannover, or even parts of Bulgaria.Additional AI issue include ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ diplomacy choices (in a game as Saxony, my Prussian overlord declared war on Sweden without reason, and followed it up on a war with Bavaria - inexplicably allied with both the English and French while they were coalitioned against eachother, only to white peace with Bavaria). And it's extremely rare to see a proper coalition war, sadly, where many of the greats get involved.Regarding the combat mechanics (which could stand to be better explained, since the tutorial doesn't do a good job of telling you how to keep armies efficiently supplied or how that at least works), armies tend to fight to the death much of the time and it's sometimes difficult to tell what's going on (ck2 may have spoiled me there). Sieges can be very random as well, with morale not having a good amount of consistancy (ie, france seiging a high-level fort that suddenly goes from maximum morale to surrender - it may be more realistic but the events need to be more visible, and I honestly prefer the EU4 & CK2 methods better). Additionally, in costal provinces, even if you have a substantial amount of artillery, there doesn't seem to be anything preventing sailing in reinforcements of a fort, to the point of aburdity, where you DON'T want the siege to end, since the army will then pop out and engage you (which can be very bad - the besieged army somehow isn't disarmed at all or even impeded in any way, resulting in a besieging army that lacked some supplies being routed if you aren't careful).Another gripe I had was how prestige determines the winnder when the year hits 1820 and there's nobody with complete naval and land dominace, which, while it mostly gives the win to the nation actually winning, it does sometimes get it horribly wrong. Some combination of factors (such as multiplying total dominace with prestige, military strength, and/or other factors).I'm a big Paradox fan (I love CK2, Hoi3, and EU4), but I can't reccomend this to others. If you want Napoleon, consider the EU4 bookmarks."

,Recommended,227760,13455879,"Posted: 19 December, 2014",all,Sarge_E,As a long time student of this era in history this one grabbed me right off the bat. It takes into account all the aspects of the Napoleonic Era. A  very stable game engine that has not crashed at all. It took sevral readings of the manual and tries at the tutorial to fully get the hang of it; but it plays great. There are also some great mods to this game that i have been playing. Haven't tried an online game as of yet. Double thumbs up on this game!!
,Not Recommended,227760,19133445,"Posted: 17 November, 2015",all,Siontix,"I would give a positive review for just about any Paradox title (yes, including Victoria II and Hearts of Iron III, as buggy as they may be), but this is a title I simply cannot baby for its mistakes.To get one thing off the board immediately, I would NEVER recommend without this mod:https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/index.php?threads/669074The reason for suggesting that mod is that it takes you, instead, back to pre-Napoleon era just prior to when he became First Consul, thus there is more time to play and less satellites of France (aka more countries to play as). Plus, the mod offers new technology and an uncommon chance to gain cores on conquered provinces--thus the freedom to build units/ships there.----------------------------------That being said, I cannot recommend the game in its vanilla state for reasons of simplicity. This game wins favorable points for its astounding combat system; I absolutely love watching battles go on, regardless of the size, and what the generals can make of situations. ...which brings me to my first issue: Generals. Some countries get an abundant amount of generals, receive a few, and some receive NONE. You have to give me credit, I pulled off a save as Egypt where I conquered all of Africa, Spain, and the Ottoman Empire; easier said than done when you only have ONE general and NO admirals to work with. In this sense, the game's only friendly toward countries like France, Britain, Austria, Prussia, and Russia. Fair enough, those countries are the center of attention, but I shake my head at the disallowed freedom to TRY and rise up as a lesser power.For me, quite a significant issue is the lack of countries that can be freed; specifically, countries like Scotland, Norway, Iceland, Finland, Hungary, Romania, Serbia, etc. do not exist in the game, so they may not be liberated. AT THE VERY LEAST, Norway couldn't have been made available to liberate? Why not!? I don't give a horse's♥♥♥♥♥if ""Norway didn't exist until 1905""; this is a game of imagination and 'what ifs'. If as France I wage war on Denmark, conquer Norway; I want the freedom to pretend that as part of the terms of peace I'm enforcing, I insist on a ""Norwegian Norway"". If conquering everything is how I'm going to play the game I'd just go play a more amateur title, like Supreme Ruler; I expect much more from my all-time favorite development studio.Lastly, let me argue that the coalition system is confusing beyond comprehension (at least to me). Yes, the coalition leader must subsidize its members, but even so, if I'm at 200+ relations with France and in a PERFECT geographic and militaristic position to strike an enemy, why is Napoleon so anal on letting me in? I wish I could have a summary of reasons returned to me like in most other Paradox titles. In this sense, getting a coalition invitation is like a surprise birthday gift to me; only that I most often decline when I do receive an invite on the grounds that I'm unprepared for war.Overall, I admit, I am almost on the fence on this one. With the mod posted above, I would recommend this game for one gold reason:March of the Eagles may be overpriced, amateurish (compared to other titles), and essentially a mini game title. Be that as it may, it is a SUPERB game to gift a friend who's new to grand strategy titles. Want someone to start playing EUIV/CKII/Vicky with you but they're unsure of whether they want to buy such expensive titles? Send them this way, this will give them an idea of what to expect in the better titles.Treat this game like a mini game title or ""get to know Paradox"" game for newcomers. Admittedly, $60 for the 4-Pack doesn't sound that bad, if you have 4 people you'd like to trick into the unresistable allure that is grand strategy.Criticize, debate, ask, praise, as you desire."

First of all, I would only recommend this for the die hard fan of grand strategy games.  Secondly, I don't know if I would get it at full price.  It goes on sale often enough where you shouldn't have to wait terribly long.  As many of the reviews say, there really is next to none content outside of war except for preparing for war which isn't terrible, it is just best not to expect anything else.  Finally, it doesn't have the amount of replayability as other grand strategy titles.  Overall, I enjoyed it, but I would only recommend it to those who love the genre and the developers."

My understanding is the vanilla game has potential, but falls short in in delivering a total game. It leaves a lot to be desired. That said, my friend pointed me to the 1792 mod, which gives the game greater depth and historical accuracy, and, I must personally say, makes the game quite enjoyable. I particularily like the additon to the battles of giving you a ""break-down"", hour by hour, of major events that transpired that were instrumental to the engagement. Moreover, I like the aspect of adding wings to each army- each army has a left, center, right flank and reserve- and you can personalize that.The game could be more robust in depth and options, but overall I give it a 7 out of 10.Also, for the record, no crashes on my end."

It is probably one of the easier paradox games to learn currently out there, focussed primarily on war, it has an economic interface that is even more simple than CK2's, and the national ideas system is rather tiny.Now, I will say single player is a bit naff, unless you play a major power you really have no hope of actually winning a game, let alone annexing territories as part of a coalition (for example, if you nab Portugal as Spain, France will just end up taking it off you due to them leading the coalition) - and when you play as a major power, say, France or Russia, the game is a bit too easy, the AI is a bit stupid and the majority of nations are just way too easy to subjugate.However, when it comes to multiplayer this game enters a league of its own. Due to the short time frame (1805-1815) an evening is more than enough time to complete a game (compared to EUIV or Victoria II games that seem to drag on for weeks), and short truce times, and the fact that you are playing against someone other than the moronic AI, leads to plenty of war and back stabbing - and a rather unpredictable and fun game in general.8/10"

In EU4, during the peaces, you have nothing to do.  In this game, you're constantly gearing up for war.  The time period is short, but with mods it can be extended 30 years.  This game takes place in the Napoleonic Wars, and the combat system reflects it.  The combat system is the best of any PDS strategy game I've played.  It *is* possible to beat the Russians with less men than they have (some people argue that it is a numbers game).  A few bugs are that the British Navy is UNKILLABLE.  1 ship can kill hundreds of Spanish and French ones.  That does not mean Britain is unbeatable.  You can win by crossing before a certain date.

You do need to keep a standing army to watch your backside/coastal regions or the British will land behind you.  I also built a reasonable capable French frigate fleet and denied the Med to the British, which helped.

Ive only put about 38 hours into this game due to the odd mechanics they applied to a very short period in which spans only about a decade while the engine that they used from CK2 and Europa causes a very rushed and overly simplified view to the events of the era. I do like the idea and concept of the overall plan for this game but it lacks a lot in the overall diplomacy and interactions between nations and on top of that it is truly lacking the overall grandeuse of some of the major events such as Napoleon's coronation and even his installment of family members as rulers. They do give you a few simple options for these events but I find them sorely lacking. I came to the assumption that through updates Paradox would modify and add to this game but due to its lacking of popularity I guess they decided to simply put it to the wayside. Overall decent game and recommend buying it on sale. Hopefully will eventually be updated and reconfigured but the light at the end of the tunnel is very dim.

If you think you send too much time worrying about gettting a CB against your neighbor, or think you should have won a battle, or defended against besiegers longer, this is your game. It has added military options, from 4 flanks in every army each with their own general, to many new options for armies and navies, such as options to avoid comat, or rush to allies battles, or even dig in at the fort and wait out the besiegers. Diplomacy is cut back a lot. Declare war on anyone you want, no trade, and no alliances. What it does have instead, are coalitions.Love the simplicity of diplomacy while focusing more on military."

The game itself is gorgeous, the music is fantastic, but that doesn't cover the faults in its approach to the era. It just doesn't go into enough depth to satisfy a Napoleonic Era gaming experience.Overall not bad, but its a perfect exapmle in missed potential. If you like the Paradox approach to Strategy games, get EU4 or something else instead. If you absolutely love the era and love the depth, get AGEODs Wars of Napoleon instead.  Get this game on sale though, its still worth a shot."

Liked the idea of building your army from regiments and unit types--line infantry/light infantry/guard infantry affected the tactics available for generals to use...but so much wasted potential.I've heard this was designed as a multiplayer game, but I've never had any friends who had it or wanted to play it and single player wise it is pretty unbalanced and while you might say ""Well, what do you expect, France had a great army, Britain had a wonderful navy"" and that's fine.  However, what I don't find enjoyable is the fact that the British navy is nigh unbeatable.  From reports in the PDS forums, you can have massive superiority and better ship quality, but due to British national ideas and the stacking pentalty, three of their ships can defeat literally dozens (if the After Action Report is to be believed, and I sadly do) of any other nations.  What's the fun of playing a historical themed game if there's no chance at all to change history?  At that point, why not just watch a documentary on the Napoleonic Wars?  Not to mention there's really no significant economic or social front to worry about, so none of the handicaps Britain faced during the period are manifest.  Instead, you're either forced to suck it up and ignore Britain, waiting to win via prestige, or find a mod.I can't be bothered with either at this point."

The periode is also far shorter. (20 years roughly)And the game manages to reflect the flavor of the period through the 'coalitation' system an era specific techtree and a focus on warfare between allies.The events are thematic although I'd have loved to see more of these.War will be almost a constant and victory is achieved by obtaining key areas for land or sea dominance.The best part of this game is the combat system. For the first time you have an indepth control over troop composition, formations, tactics, generals and subcommanders.This impacts the game greatly and you can end up having your armies specialize. Concepts such as experience, frontage, supplies etc are very important.In conclusion if you're a Napoleonics fan, enjoy the EU engine and you want a quick, fun strategic experience then go for it.Wait for a small discount and pick up the 2 DLCs that'll add some more visual flair. And you'll be set to go.""La Garde meurs mais se rends pas!"""

However by the time I captured the FIRST port to even get a beach head. THe year is 1816 (the game ends at 1820) so I just left the game. It's a great game and fun to play in short bursts (30 minutes to an hour), but don't expect this to be a Victoria 2 stlye game of staying up 24 hours playing as some little country nobody cares about, trying to colonise). Expect this to be a quick 30 minute skirmish with no diplomacy. Diplomacy is here, but whats the point when you play as France?  You mass your whole army into 1 giant stack, 300 thousend+ and litterally, blitzkreig the whole of Europe with not a single defeat."

This game has barely anything going for it and its normal price tag of $20 is absurd for the content available. Like most paradox games, you can play as any country. However, only a few of them are worth playing as, and you can't even win the game with most of them. There is little variety between countries other than starting position and a game can be finished in one sitting. So basically once you've beaten the game a couple times, you've gained the full experience it has to offer.Really low quality by paradox standards, I would rather get castrated than buy this game again."

Please do not buy this game if you respect your hard work and money. Also, their DLC policies is worsening at every release. Giving little to irrevelant content, and asking for a high price. (That's even higher now, despite everyone complaining about their pricing, which was already bad back in the day.)So I suggest anyone else to NOT fall in their pathetic policies, and AVOID at all costs any of their games.-------------------------------------------Fantastic underrated game. The thrown away child amongst all of Pradox's DLC whoring titles..lol One of it's best aspects actually since you can get the whole game without needing 45 DLC = 250$..lol But if you like 4X this is a great title for your library.It's simple and single minded...war mechanics. Only problem was it was abandoned by Paradum.This is a game judged harshly for what it isn't and what people thought it was instead of for what it is and what it was meant to be. What this game isn't is a grand strategy game seeking to model every cultural and economic aspect of running a nation in Europe in the early 19th century. What this game is, to put it simply, is a Napoleonic version of Hearts of Iron. It's purely a war game and that's all it aspires to be, and as a war game it's pretty enjoyable. It's a masterpiece completely underrated and neglected by paradox, with the mods and dlc's their other games get this could be one of their best games, yet it's good anyway, unlike Europa Universalis it's completely focused on combat, so forget politics and marriages, it's time to BATTLE! The possibilities are endliess and no two armies are alike. Unlike every other Paradox game that isn't Hearts of Iron, this game's combat isn't a simple matter of just shoving two doom stacks into one giant province, watching floating numbers for a few seconds, and the other one scurrying off. It's about creating highly customised and unique armies commanded by countless possible commanders in order to give yourself a tactical edge. Combat is deep, nuanced, constant, and satisfying."

Though MotE succeeds in its ultimate goals, the game itself stands on uncertain ground. It struggles to find its place in the library of other grand strategies as it focuses solely on the military and geopolitical aspects of the Napoleonic Wars. While some consumers may find this acceptable, fans of the Europa Universalis series (which closely resembles MotE in both style and mechanics) may be disappointed by lack of political depth. On the other hand, being a grand strategy title with large barriers to entry and a sharp learning curve may keep casual strategy gamers at bay. In completely unrelated culinary terms, March of the Eagles can be perceived as too lean for hardcore Paradox fans while also being to beefy for newcomers to the franchise. Despite this, the game still remains enjoyable and fulfilling to those who stick with it. Though most of the game involves preparing supplies and armies for the inevitable attack of the French, some smaller moments also break through. Having my 5th Portuguese Dragoon regiment march from Algeria to Sweden collecting the banners of defeated regiments was great fun. All-in-all, March of the Eagles is a pleasant experience for those gamers who want to experience the military side of grand strategy and have always wanted to reshape the history of Europe.Pros-- Reliable engine (no crashes seen)- Fair mechanics- Various factions to playCons-- Poor tutorials- Based around military ( Personal preference)- Lack of faction varietyScore:   7.5/10"
