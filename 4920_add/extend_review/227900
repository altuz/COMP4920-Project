A single-player only version of Battleship? Why? This is stupid at best. And I'm stupid for assuming it would contain multiplayer.♥♥♥♥♥u/me."

It is a playable game, but last I checked, there is no multiplayer, and its very simply done. The core game logic is there, but the animations are simple and cheesy, and they don't fit the theme of a tabletop game."
,Not Recommended,227900,29000350,Posted: 4 January,all,DeadPoolX,"The version of Battleship that's on Steam has three different modes: classic, salvo, and nuclear.Classic mode is what we're all probably used to seeing. You fire, and hit or miss, it's the opponent's turn.Salvo allows you to fire as many shots as you have ships available. In other words, if you have three ships remaining, you can fire three individual shots anywhere on the board during your turn. It's in Salvo mode that keeping as many ships afloat is crucial, as serious advantages or disadvantages can occur based on fleet size.Nuclear is a made-for-video-game mode only. In here, you have special weapons (such as torpedoes, mines, air strikes, etc) that are unlocked as you progress through the game. While the additions in Nuclear mode are neat, the problem is that the AI does not have the same restrictions you do, so it has immediate access to all weaponry. Unless you've unlocked enough weapons, you'll be at a serious disadvantage.While playing there are cutscenes when you attack with any weapon. If you miss, your shells fall harmlessly into the ocean; however, if you hit, you see your shots doing damage to whichever ship you hit. These cutscenes include special weapons in Nuclear mode, so if you launch an attack helicopter, you'll see that particular cutscene instead of the standard ""turret aims and fires"" scene.The graphics aren't great, but they aren't absolutely hideous either. I like that the cutscenes differ depending on weapon fired and which ship you hit. Also, the weather can change, so in one game it can be bright and sunny, and the in the next, it can be dark and stormy.So far, this is sounding like a pretty good adaptation, but there's one MAJOR problem: it's single-player only.That's right, there's no multiplayer at all. You can't play against anyone online and apparently there's no local multiplayer (aka ""hotseat"") available either, despite the store page specifically stating ""sink enemy battleships in hotseat play.""This means that whoever wrote the store's description either had no clue what they were selling or outright lied. Both possibilities are inexcusable.Battleship is meant to be a multiplayer game. Playing against the AI is okay, but most people (myself included) would've liked to play against other people and probably bought it with that assumption in-mind because the store page says there is hotseat gameplay.Fortunately, I bought this game during the Winter Sale, so while I'm still annoyed at the errors posted on the store page, at least I didn't waste money purchasing it at full price.Due to the incorrect information presented — through either carelessness or dishonesty — I'll have to give this game a NO recommendation."

I liked the graphics and salvo mode and superweapon mode.  It is sufficiently replayable for $3.99, as you can work up the ranks up to Admiral.  The game would be better if it had online multiplayer.  I would not pay the full price of $9.99 for this game, however."

But how do you make a game based on a head-to-head board game and NOT include a multiplayer option?!3 out of 5 mainly for that reason.  It's well made but anyone looking to play battleship will be disappointed by the total lack of multiplayer so...thumbs down."
76561197990903915,Recommended,227900,14397622,"Posted: 8 February, 2015",all,mrclj5,it is a fun game. challenging to a point you have to achieve things to get better weapons in super weapons mode. the draw back is the pc  plaer is not bound by the task it will get the weapons no matter what! the game i enjoy but the higher you go the pc becomes better i have never got all weapons. 1 you need to hit all 5 ships in 1 attack. the other you need to sink all 5 without a loss of your ship and the big 1 a satelite laser you have to kill all 5 enemy ships in 10 attacks. if you add it up    the total is 17 but if the pc is given the bonus cruiser now its 20. it is not possible when the pc gets all the weapons without doing what the player has to do to get the same weapons. this  game was set up never to be beat! I still try thinking maybe i will get lucky and catch a break and get the weapons to win the super weapons level as far as the rest of the salvoe mode and classic excellent! a fun game.

The salvo and Superweapons game modes add a bit more dimension instead of simply B1, miss, C3, miss, D6, hit..... ect...Nothing special, but easily worth it if you find it on sale or liked this game growing up,"

My primary objection is a lack of a multiplayer setting either through hotseat or over the web.  If yuou want to play against a reasonably random AI in a single player mode of an old classic, then go for it."

,Recommended,227900,22150721,"Posted: 30 March, 2016",all,the1observant,"If you're looking for a simple, but still cool, single-player Battleship game, then Pop Cap made the perfect one right here. Not only does it show the use of white and red pegs to give an authentic feel to it, but also some animated radar cosmetics. You're shown some eye candy animated cutscenes with every shot for either a miss or a hit, and the background graphics comes complete with random weather and ambient sound effects. You can easily immerse yourself into the game and play for hours while trying to increase your rank. It's a very pleasant ""chillaxing"" type of game where everything is point-n-click super easy.I like all 3 modes of Classic, Salvo, and Super Weapon, but Super Weapon is my favorite mode. Super Weapon is probably everybody's favorite.In Classic mode it's your basic Battleship game where you and the computer take turns destroying each other. Not that much to it.In Salvo mode it's a Ship-turn-Shot game. If you have 5 ships, then you get 5 shots on your turn. Lose a ship and you lose a shot for only 4 shots per turn. Then 3, 2, and 1, if you're having a bad game. Trying to maintain 5 shots is really hard to do, but not impossible. Salvo is Salvo, that's all there is to it.In Super Weapon mode it's a Weapons-charge-Shot game. You only get 1 shot per turn, but you can really make that shot count when your weapons charge up. With one shot you can fire upon 1, 3, 5, 7, 10, 15+ coordinates, depending on what weapon you have loaded into your arsenal. There's bombers, gun-copters, shields, satellite laser beams, mines, decoy's, and a bunch of others I haven't even unlocked yet. Yes, you have to unlock most of the weapons by continuing to play the game and keep sinking enemy ships over and over, round after round. You also have to rank up to unlock some of the weapons too.The graphics are not superb, but it's good enough for this type of game.The sounds would be what you normally expect with clicks, explosions, turret effects, and other sounds matching their device or purpose. Some of the ambient sounds can get a little annoying and repetitive, but still tolerable.Now let's talk about the A.I. - It starts out rather easy and appears to be dumb at first, but after you play the game and start ranking up, the A.I. appears to match your rank and gains intelligence. It also uses a multiple random seed to pick coordinates and this is reflected with the multiple decisions you see the A.I. making before taking a shot. Seeking your ships is completely random, but after it gets a hit the A.I. will concentrate on sinking that ship with similar human intelligence. You will notice the A.I. behavior by the time you reach Captain and your usual ship configurations that used to trick the A.I. does not work anymore. That's how I know this Battleship game has an advanced A.I., and is a worthy opponent.I would recommend this game to anyone who likes board games."

I drawback I can say is that fact it is singleplayer only since battleship has always been a two player game, this is unfortunate but, I suppose if you don't have a person to play battleship with this works almost as well.  All around not bad but not particularly spectacular either."

,Not Recommended,227900,34008754,Posted: 3 August,all,LordWeegeeIII,The point of battleship is to play with other people. This just allows you to play by yourself with a stupid A.I. Just go buy the bored game version.
