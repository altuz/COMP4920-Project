Second, There are no extra gamemodes other than classic(no Capital Risk, no Same-Time Risk, no choice in 60%/80%/100% Domination, JUST CLASSIC.... ONLY CLASSIC). Third, the game just doesn't really articulate the battle sequence and will leave you wondering what just happened.If you want to play Risk on your computer get Risk: Factions, this game is horribly incomplete. Alternatively, you can download Risk II on CNET but it is up to you to get a game to work with no support(just like this game I imagine).Post Sctiptum: Same-Time Risk, best way to play in my opinion."

There is no online multiplayer but it does have local multiplayer.  It's good for someone like me who doesn't really care about online play for a game like this.  It also lets you play the game fast pace because you can quickly skip through the computers turns and then see what happened and make your move.  No more waiting for that one pesky player that just wont go, and no worried about someone online going AFK for long periods of time.  If this sounds like something you would desire from a game this is a good pick (I travel a lot for work and it is a nice game to play when I am sitting on a cramped air plane, I have even played with other passangers I meet sitting next to me).  If this game sounds like you I would also recommend picking up the game of monopoly on here that is also on steam, it is a very similar setup as this game. If you just want online play then your going to be disappointed and I would recommend avoiding this game."

But you can only play against AI (which doesn't act remotely human), the virtual die rolls tend toward extreme results with implausible frequency, and even the interface is somewhat unreliable. I mean it about those die rolls - you can easily go from the only player with long-term control of defensible continents to the guy getting hosed off the map because the ""dice"" gave the AI a 10:1 kill ratio when it counted. Granted, this partly compensates for the awfulness of the AI, but it's still pretty aggravating. Oh, and it crashes or drops your current game from time to time, though they're getting a little better about patching it. But it's just a bad product.. Sadly, it's also one of the few of its kind I've found on Steam, hence my embarassingly huge play time."

Achieving this won't be easy though. You'll have to be tactfull and keep an eye on your competition all the time.Pro's:+ If you like the board game, you will like this version aswell.+ Nice graphics. Nothing too fancy, staying true to the original board, but with a new touch.+ AI is tactfull. AI will try to prevent oponents to gain/hold of a continent.+ Customization of your game. You can set a limited amount of options in order to customize your game.Cons:- Very limited gameplay options. No missions, no on-line multiplayer.- Replayability is low. Ofcourse every game is different, but due to the limited amount of options it feels like repeating the same over an over very quickly.I can recommend the game for the true Risk fans. If it's on sale it's even nice to pick up if your relative new to the game. However else I'd save my money for something else. Mainly due to the limited options a no for Risk.

The game never crashed  on me, and I destroyed the AI after an hour of playing against 4 other computer controled players. There were no freezes, there was no game lag, nothing that kept me from having a fun time in a Risk game I have grown to love over the years. I felt like the music was fine and set a good mood and pace. Honestly the only thing the game could benefit from are some instructions - what does this card type do if I get 3 in a row? Or what does this button do? The rules of movement in each phase? etc etc. If you have ever played Risk before, you should  be fine.  If you haven't, then one play through of the game will explain it for you with learned, hands on experience.Honestly, the game is a Great buy and I wouldn't be suprised if you end up being happy with it too.

Antrider,"There are two games you want to win at when attending a party to really flash your nuts--prove that you got big ole steel ballz.  Of course, those would be Chess and Risk.  Ladies, I know you don't have ballz, but I know for a fact you kan dominate at Risk... so don't think I'm discriminating.  We'll just say if you have an iron cl*t... or something.  Why do we always measure dominance in ballz?  Anyways.....This is a bare-bones version of Risk.  You can tweak a bit of the rules, but very little.  It's essentially classic Risk, like when it first came out.  It's single player, unfortunately... because EA doesn't have the money to throw down on figuring out how to make Risk f**king multiplayer.  But.... it is redeemed in its fast gameplay.  You can choose to auto battle or roll each turn.  Each game lasts me only about 10-30 minutes which is nice so you can sneak a quick game in once in awhile.  No mission cards, or tactical cards, which I very much like.  I think the original board was perfect in itself and enjoy this pure experience.  It's great to practice different strategies on since the games are so simple and quick.WORD TO THE WISE: Alright, really this game is kind of a giant load of sh*t.  Don't let the description by the developers fool you.  They could have made it a million times more immaculate. It IS a great alternative to all the shotty attempts at Risk knock-offs.  But it's also the same game, essentially, that is on Pogo.  So your money is probably better tossed there if you don't permanently want this in your steam library.  At least on Pogo you could play other people... you can't make alliances unless you pay money though.Caveat emptor~Risk works half the time on my computer and half the time just completely frizzes out in ridiculous ways I can't understand.  I am pretty sure this is a Win8 problem, but if you can tolerate the program freezing 50% of the time you try and play, it's worth it.  Try and get this game on sale, definitely.. unless you REALLY have that kraving for Risk.  I'll throw the specs for my laptop up on my profile if you want to compare... I suggest going tocanirunit.comor whatever the hell that one site is when trying out games."

Sadly I was very mistaken.  It's very simple, multiplayer has to be done on the same computer (I can get that for PS1 but on a PC? LAN should at least be an option).To top it off, the 'dice' rolls are blatantly rigged in the favour of the computer opponents. Even accounting for the base game's bias toward a defender, it's staggering how blatantly the computer loads these digitial dice.All in all, for a digitial game of risk, you'd be better dusting off that PS1 and firing it up. At least it also had plentiful maps and game modes."

The game is a GOOD singleplayer game , because it is risk , what more do i need to say.Multiplayer has never been a priority to have fun gaming. As loads of singleplayergames are on top of the most played gameslist as well. Plenty of people out there that dont want to be forced into multiplayer experiences anyway.This Risk version has only a few difficulty settings , and its adviceble to play the hardest setting for the challenge it will give you , all though the diehard gamers might argue even this mode gets too easy in the long run. And they are right.Still , get it on a sale , as there are not a lot of options in this basic type of game. I just need to mention this is the most fun version of the riskversions on steam..if you dont count the big europa universalis, civilization and those type of games in that same list.However , if you are looking for a game with challenges, extended options, and events get these instead.

It's good to kill a few minutes ... but why does it need to have a futuristic/post-apocalyptic style?Past PC versions of Risk had the classic imperialist style that comes with the board game, and that era fits.  This version just feels depressing.Still a great job, just not my favorite PC version."

It appears to run, but then I can't select anything in the opening menu, it simply doesn't respond to the keyboard or mouse. My 9 minutes of ""gameplay"" was me just opening it several times and trying to get it to work.An opportunity to view it elsewhere also left me unimpressed. I played an older version while growing up and that version puts this one to shame. I do not care much about the lack of multiplayer, as I was only looking for single player with AIs, the way I used to play, anyway. But the screen is awful (the game launches in a small window, and the so called ""full screen"" is a skinny view, running down the centre and leaving at least half the screen wasted to either side. It also appears to be far less attractive overall compared to the years-old game, has a terrible AI system, a complete lack of options before starting the game, crappy sound effects, no clear battle sequence, I could go on.Hasbro should be ashamed of itself for releasing this version. It appears as if they did not care to release a game that could even be considered decent. A shame, considering how fun the original board game and computer version were."

The AIs are pretty dumb.  There's only one map.  The game crashes here and there, especially on expert level.  Also, the game's rigged.  It decides to favor the AI or you in certain situations.  It's not purely chance which I find to be a core element to the game and its outcome.So, while you may pick this version up for a low cost, and it does provide an outlet for the people without anyone to sit down with in person, I would not suggest this rendition.  If you're looking for a nice PC rendition of this classic game, continue searching elsewhere."

It makes it easy to set difficulties if you are just starting out or if you are a pro.

So that means:-No alternate maps-no real varriation in gameplay (except changing card redeem values).If you just want basic risk and nothing else this is fine.That being said I had these issues with this version of Risk:- 3 basic AI settings and they are all pretty easy.- The acomplishments are just basic ""Repeat this task X times""- There is nothing done to add visual interest (such as unit movement or battle animation)There are better Risk  style (not officially licensed) games that are free for mobile and pc.I think that there may be more extensive offically licenced versions of this game (I at least hope so).

For this purpose, the game was very helpful.  I mastered the game concepts within a couple of games.On the other hand, I found the computer to be a pretty easy opponent, only losing once after 6 or 7 rounds on the hardest difficulty level (keep in mind that I'm a complete beginner).  And there's no multiplayer, so there's no possibility of challenging myself further with this game.  I just bought it today and I already feel I'm close to squeezing out all the fun that I'm going to get out of this one.The dealbreaker for me though, is I can't seem to get windowed mode to work.  I simply get an error message that says that my screen is not compatible with windowed mode.  This is a pretty cheap game with substandard graphics.  They couldn't have coded it well enough to make windows mode compatible with my screen?  That's pretty bizarre.Another bad element is that there is only one game mode: Classic.Botttom line: I'd say this game would be better priced at 5 dollars (generously).  Regular Risk players probably shouldn't bother even at that price.  As is, I'll probably keep playing once in a while if I'm in the mood for Risk, but I feel I've overpaid for very bottom-of-the-barrel product."

The Computer blatantly forgoes strategy simply to stuff it in the human player's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. I was playing expert using 2 human profiles for myself against 4 computers. I had red in Africa and Blue in south america. Gold had Australia and a foothold in Europe. My African boarders were all protected with 4+ soldiers, and Green who had Europe did not have more than 3 on a single territory. So what does Gold do? Does he take the logical approach and secure Europe for himself? Fuuuuuuck no. He plows a trail through Africa into South America, just to plant 3 men there. The Computer literally disregarded obvious strategy just to ram♥♥♥♥♥♥in♥♥♥♥♥against the human players(both were me in this case, and believe me, my ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ is sore). It's bad enough that the dice roll is blatantly biased in favor of the computer to the point that I sent 3 sets of territories against 1 territory defended by 1 soldier, and lost 5 or 6 soldiers doing so, but to have the computer not even operate strategically is just too much. I want to like this game, but they should have worked on these mechanics a little more."
