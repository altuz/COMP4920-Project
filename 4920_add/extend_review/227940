76561198041292130,Not Recommended,227940,30231838,Posted: 27 February,all,Simplicity,"I'm afraid I cannot recommend this game. I tried, I played it for a while and I might continue to play it (in a more limited way), but honestly I think I'm done.There are a few technical problems with the game:Performance of the game varies highly between updates. I got anything from sustained 60 fps (with vsync on) at high quality setting to 20-25 on the lowest quality.Weird lag issues. Game freezes momentarily on certain occasions, sometimes at crucial events, eg. just before being killed. This is not related to CPU or memory nor GFX card. I doubt it's network related. If it is, it's server side.The game also feels a bit unbalanced. If enemy has air superiority, you're doomed. As ground unit there's not a lot you can do. This brings me to the next frustrating fact: you have several characters each has several weapons. You cannot swapcharacters orweapons during a match. You have to leave the match, leave the squad and then you can swap weapons.EDIT: apparently you can swap characters if you have more than one of the same class. Thanks to RooZ for bringing this up. I haven't tested it, though. Swapping for a different class is possible if the squad has proper slotsThere's a lot of griding as many have said. Personally I don't mind griding per se. What  I do mind is having to play for extended amount of time at a severe disadvantage. So either you pay money to upgrade fast or you are basically working for Reto as unpaid cannon fodder for their paying customers. In some games if you're good you may get a fighting chance. But not here. As infantry - yes. As tank crewman, not really. You will be put against superior tanks that you cannot harm with your puny cannon. And when you die you'll have to wait before spawning again and then walk or drive for a while to get to the action. There's a lot of waiting and walking in this game. I guess that makes it a more realistic military simulation. ;)The grind is the price of a free game you say. Fair enough. However this game also suffers from the same problems as any other FPS, free or not. The lack of teamplay. When I first started playing H&G I saw how team actions (capturing) actually gives you significantly more score points compared to just killing an enemy. I said ""wonderful, they found a way to make people actually do objectives"". Sadly I was mistaken. Points schmoints. There are still very few people who will actively engage in coordinated cooperative gameplay. You'll get a circle of campers just outside capture zone. People will use resources without considering they're limited and waste them. Tank drivers will not rotate tanks so that support gunners may engage targets. Vehicles with MGs are never parked with their guns facing enemy positions. A fair amount will not follow common sense regarding objective selection and some will even roam aimlessly around the map.I'd gladly pay money for a game with a nice teamplay-oriented community but this one isn't it.So, should you play this free game? After all I said I might continue. If you do, stick to infantry, most vestatile, easiest to survive. Get a car or a motorbike to get from spawn area to the action. If you go for any other class, expect a lot more grinding and consider that your leveling strategy and point investment may be subverted by game designers at any point."
,Not Recommended,227940,29886402,Posted: 12 February,all,Iomhar,"So, I could rant for 30 hours straight on what I think this game could have been, has been, and could become, but it's pointless. I've played many games, especially world war two games, and this used to hold a special place in my heart. I loved to play tactically with my friends, it was some of the best time I ever had. Combining the aspects of planes, tanks, infantry, and actual strategy was perfect. But early on it always had parts missing, things I felt were necessary. I gave it time, hoping it would come around, and then the updates came.Where to start. Bias? Bias. Enough said. Oh, but the squad update was cool! Then came... The rest. They made it harder for new players, then easier, then harder, then easier. But it still treated the new players terribly. Now they've added new planes, and they aren't anything to be desired. They're just another aspect to a still dying game. The game is losing it's aspect of being unique. There is not enough base infantry playing anymore to mean anything, so most of the games play out like some sort of murder spree between planes, tanks, and snipers.Recently I came back. I left after one game. It's pure murder, sometimes worse than what I've heard out of Call of Duty. I can't say much more. I just don't recommend it."
,Not Recommended,227940,29626838,Posted: 1 February,all,Nico_ProMods,"Playing the game leaves some sort of frustration, especially since the updates often downgrade the game. Changes in gameplay cause the game to not be fun anymore. I'm fine with the pay to play system where people who want to spend money can progress quicker. I don't want to spend money on a game that's not finished. However the new system limits the player to do anything. In the past you could grind yourself into different classes. This way you could train your character for the class it will become. With the new system you would need more than 500k credits just to buy a rank 0 recon... It's impossible for the casual player to purchase such character.Furthermore the game is full of spray and pray type of gameplay, not to forget the constant grenade spamming. Also the amount of hackers is high. 40% of the games you play you will encounter ppl using aimbots, wall hacks and what not. It's a shame, this makes the game quite annoying.As for the gameplay, it's nice. It works rather well with resources etc. Once you start to get the hang of it, it's a nice game to play. It's a shame that the devs ruin it with their updates, and won't listen to the people playing this game. Probably explains the reviews.As for new players: It's free, so try it out. Don't expect to much from it and don't get used to the current system of things, it can change anytime."

The defenders spawn nearly on their spawn points while the attackers need to travel distances and are easy sniper and tank bait.The only infantry that you really see playing this game are people using sniper rifles and people grinding for sniper rifles. Apart from those few people that are properly playing infantry, it's just paratroopers, pilots, snipers and tankers that are filling the battles. Infantry should be the backbone of any team, capturing points, yet all they happen to be is fodder bait these days.I sincerely hope that Reto will come back on their decision with the movement of the spawn, because those changes made (attacking) infantry just plain cannon fodder."
,Not Recommended,227940,29579717,Posted: 29 January,all,SimonEp3,"This game used to be fun. I played for awhile early on and then took a break for a while. I recently came back to it and lots has changed. The servers are complete♥♥♥♥♥♥ overall server ping is terrible, the new UI (uneeded) looks okay but the devs did not really address many of the real gameplay/mechanics issues. If you've played this game at all, you will notice a lot of seasoned players are beginning to leave, queues for ATs during war time are drastically lower than they used to be.Another huge problem if you are looking at starting this game as a new player is that prices for gear, guns, soldiers, etc, have gone up 200%. Really disappointed in the direction this game has gone.*** Edit: As of August 15, 2017 the game is still plagued by numerous issues. The playerbase continues to dwindle, forcing many of the war battles on the RTS side into auto-resolve. Many times you will sit in queue for an hour or more waiting for a game to pop, only for it to be full of alt accounts, or trolls and the game is over in less than 10 minutes. If Reto put a ""waiting"" badge in the game, everyone that plays would have it in gold in less than a day.The auto-resolve function is constantly abused, as is the morale mechanic. People play the morale war rather than actually playing battles. The true RTS is almost non-existent, the war map lags or doesn't update properly.The FPS side has issues with frame drops, lag, and even after the introduction of the new spawn system it still has huge issues with spawn camping. You can find a few good people to play with, but overall the community (especially in the H&G forums) is toxic."
76561197993520308,Not Recommended,227940,29709327,Posted: 4 February,all,InvalidKeyPress,"This game has so much going for it.  The gameplay is fairly good with decent integration of infantry air and vehicular combat.  The premise is great and it's well executed.The problem is the grind model.  It's one of the worst offending p2w games i know.  Some might say it's pay to get there faster, but that's a known model from several other games and this just doesn't measure up to that.  The grinds are exceptionally long, and weapon customization can take a lot of experience to upgrade all the parts and literally become better than the next guy.  You can spend weeks or months doing that, or you can just buy better weaponry than everyone else has.   And people do.  It makes it so that f2p people cannot compete.  You can run around and die a lot.  If you're good you might be able to make a difference, but on a bell curve most people are intermediates at best.  Beginners and general intermediate players suffer when other players can just have better stuff altogether.  F2P gamers shouldn't necessarily be catered, but if you want to keep them around - and any F2P game does - then you'd better make it worth their while to stay.  Sadly, heroes and generals does not.I loved playing this game, and got far enough in a couple of nations to have a few toys to play with.  But getting up into higher echelons of gear and abilites takes forever, and getting there means encountering people who just  steamroll you with significantly better equipment.  It's not fun.  I uninstalled, and while i miss the game - it's fun when it's balanced - i won't be coming back."

,Not Recommended,227940,29732593,Posted: 5 February,all,Sarblade 🐬,"Heroes & Generals would be a nice game if only the devs were thinking while developing new updates.After all this years there are still the same 5 (FIVE) maps for the assault mode (main mode), and two of them are the same airport. They're pushing out new vehicles when there are no variety of battlegrounds. I mean, with THAT engine (old) and THAT level of detail (low) it's pretty easy to add 2-3 more maps instead of a useless boat-tank when there isn't even enough water to make it useful. I swear, you can even rycicle them or use fractions of the 5 maps to add Smirmish smaller maps (like a Church based map). Just do something.There is a huge conquerable map with all the cities from Europe and yeah, on every city spot there are those 5 damn maps.Going back to play World War II Online: Battlegrounds would be a wiser choice."
76561198038784608,Not Recommended,227940,29906205,Posted: 13 February,all,ArxontaS62,"I ve been playing this game for about 2 years and i have mixed feelings about it. It’s free, the FPS-RTS combination makes it very interesting and addictive because each battle is meaningful and has an impact on the war, it is fun to play with friends but at the same time it has some issues that haven’t been fixed yet that are really annoying.For the new players this game is just brutal. You choose 1 soldier for 1 of the 3 factions and you get thrown into an encounter battle. ‘Capture and hold the objective’ glhf. No tutorial, no training session to give you the basic idea of the game mechanics and gunplay. There used to be a quick training mission, where you could at least shoot some of the guns, bazooka, scoped rifle and Anti-Air but it’s now removed. Anyways, after a few encounters, 2 skirmishes, 1 town, 1 factory and 1 airfield battle (matchmaker keeps throwing you back to the encounter map for some reason) you get player rank VII which means you will be matched against any player from now on, either it’s another newbie or a veteran (experienced player). So for a while (since the grind is quite a lot) you ll probably find yourself in a disadvantage having to fight against better geared players, tanks and planes. A few encounter battles later you can join the war, extra xp/ribbon boost + underdog bonus, ‘yes please!’. Except now you go against hardcore players/clans and uneven resources. And that’s when most new players give up and go spam forums with ‘everyone is cheating-op guns/tanks/planes’ threads. My point is, I think the new players are not given enough time to learn the game before they reach the endgame (war battles) and they end up leaving when they get stomped by vets over and over again.Of course you can pay real money to unlock stuff and support the developers, like any other free to play game. Does this make it pay to win? No, you can get everything with in game credits. Buying veteran membership (recommended, if you decide to spend money on the game) or straight up buying unlocks just speeds up the grind.Now for the veteran players I don’t really know what to say. We ve all seen how the game is going downhill one update after the other :/Squad system massively limited the usage of special classes, so if you don’t have auxiliary seat in your squad you can’t use any of them, or you end up in some low rank dude’s squad who can’t even give ordersThere is no balance in the matchmaking system. More often than not you get in some battles with too many tanks and planes and recons vs infantry and paratroopers, how is this even fun?...Gunplay got messed up all together in one of the updates with the cone fire changes. Now gun balancing is done by nerfing to the ground whichever gun is performing well at the timeThe sound bug of the semi-auto and bolt-action rifles still exists and sometimes happens to full auto guns as well lately which for me it is the most annoying bug because I mainly use sound to spot enemiesThe RTS part is completely broken and ignored. The usual suspects start battles with alt accounts or autoresolve their way to victory although they have favorable attack-defense lines in most battlesThe community is asking for new maps, instead we get some rework on the old maps, which some were good (mountain town, factory, airfield) and some were just performance killers (town and skirmishes, too much jungle -.- ). Also the cap points went from being tiny and 1 grenade could clear the point to being extremely big and really hard to defend (those roof cap zones are ridiculous…).Meanwhile in reto-moto HQ everything is working as intended!Don’t get me wrong, the devs are doing work, and they bring regular updates to the game, be that guns, cars, tanks, planes etc, which are nice but they are not good enough for me personally to keep playing the game and having fun while those core issues I mentioned above exist.I m looking forward to the new renderer update, hope it comes with a few improvements, but at the current state of the game i wouldn't recommend it.TL;DR: if you are new to the game don’t go in with high expectations, there is a lot of grind and it will be tough until you start getting better equipment. And let’s hope reto will start fixing some stuff and make HnG great again."

Another very disappointing thing about this game it is way too expensive if you try to accellarate your way to more advanced skills and weapons.

They lose every war in last place but win most of the skirmishes because of some stupid HP system and some really stupid OP weapons.Another major issue: TanksFirst off, I'd like to say that when you have a machine gun in the game cost just as much as a Tiger I, you've got issues.""So, what is the MAIN issue?"" I hear you saying aloud as you read this. Well, the tanks are their own worst enemy. If you do what their supposed to do, support Infantry as they move from objective to objective, they get wrecked by an Anti-Tank Rambo with a motorcycle and some AT Grenades.So the tanks sit back and cut people in half with 75mm's, 85mm's, and 88mm's from a mile away. So, the infantry and paratroopers are caught with their pants around their ankles with their♥♥♥♥♥ which is mooning a taxi driver in NYC by the way, hanging in the breeze. So objectives just get traded until someone, eight hours later, wins.Tanks also get killed for staying still so it's a lose/lose situation if you pick that career option.Oh and it doesn't make a difference if you are driving in a Tiger II or an M4 Sherman, your♥♥♥♥♥is molasses as Sheriff Buford T. Justice would say.Planes are an absolute joke to fly. I can't seem to do it and others can. Fly Germany if you want wings on your chest I guess? I don't know. The P-38 seems like a stupid option for an aircraft. The P-51 and P-47 were more used than the P-38 for the game's intended purpose so why is this mediocre aircraft there?Paratrooper is the best career hands down. You can join the fight anywhere your plane flies and you get that sweet sweet M1A1 Carbine.Sniper's are OP but I guess that's their role so I don't know. OHK rifles, that ones the snipers get, are realistic but they seem limited to the bolt-action rifles. Most of which fire the same round as their ""starter rifle"" counter parts for brand new players. And these starter rifles take two or three shots to kill someone at medium to close range. So not realistic then.Infantry is where you'll get the most out of the game. The most weapons and vehicles for all purposes. Before AT mines were nerfed I would destroy two Tiger's in every life I had. Just place the mine below it's♥♥♥♥♥ run away, shoot the mine. And the whole thing just blew up. The most fun I had.The Soviets get no MG on their starter utility car/vehicle. So they are at a supreme disadvantage going against level 1 American or German motorized infantry.Currently, this game is turning to garbage update after update. People don't cooperate with teams at all. They just go out to score some Kills because....K/D's are more important.The playerbase is shrinking and no new players are coming because all of the good reviews are in the negative. Some good effort was poured into this game but ultimately, the developers didn't listen to the community. I think they should try again, but smooth things out before adding content.So, I give a negative review for Bicycle Simulator 2016."

Unless you're really, I mean really, a huge WW2 buff, you should stay away from this joke of a game. The starting ideas were good and abitious, but quickly became irrevelant and perverted, until you reach this point. There isn't a single positive point I can think of...Setting, maybe? The disgusting hit detection mechanics, the boring game modes, completely silent soldiers, infantry being litteraly cannon fodder (so much that one sec. after spawnprotection turns off a sniper picks you off or a roaming tank flattens you), unnececerally huge maps (#WalkingSim) are only a small part of the long list that makes this game laughable. The biggest problem is that the Pay2Win model, absurd matchmaking, and the obsolescence of infantry because of the power of tanks+better geared players, combined, will probably make you quit the game the moment you start playing it (You're lucky if you happen to spawn without dying). ONLY if you spend real money, you will start enjoying the game, that's how those pesky Devs made it. F2P my♥♥♥♥♥"

First i want to say how i play it and what's good about it.The best part about the game are the smaller map like the starting depot match wich i played the longest. Here you only use a smg or generally the second weapon you buy, no upgrades or improvments to it. People fully uprade their weapons, use expensive ammo and throw grenades.....then they see they don't earn any money. Well.....this is what's wrong about the game, they took the penalties of being abusive or over-using weapons-tactics to such a stupid point that newer non paying members can't really abuse it but older player with more time/weapons/skill can dominate.1) Don't play bigger maps if you don't like them the immersion, the time to walk/search/hide/kill.2) Using antitank weapons/grandes is the fastest way to lose money, grab some AT weapons from the crates instead or use the free ones you can equip on cars/apc. Tanks are not that hard to destroy, if at weapons were cheap the tanks would be useless.3) The longer you play, the more refined you need to play because a bigger map needs more finnese while a small map like depot needs reflexes or just a good team.4) The development of this game has really went down the drain, they should make smaller maps or focus on an Objective gameplay like capture the flag/king of the hill/hold multiples zones/ rush the enemy/ defend location for X minutes. So don't invest time in this game if you are starting now becase almost all game modes are made for veteran/gear heavy players.I recommand this game because it's quite well balanced, you can pick the enemy max upgrade weapons and kill with them because you also get their full ammo and it requires more intelligence that a regular shooter.It was the best mmo f2p shooter at some point, really filling that gap that battlefield heroes left(at least for me) but it seems it's a big grind now.I usually grind the depot map for a 1 month sub, it takes me about a week if i am lucky but it can be done since most points you recive for squad tactics and assisting.The final verdict would a 8/10 for what it is in this genre and sadly it does not have a classic mode were all players have basic starting rifles.......wich is the best part of the game. I don't see the developers including maps/mission where all players have the same gear, standard or as a requirment because it would fix the game.Play it if you like to play for a few hours every week, don't even bother with the largers wars because they take too much time and don't give anything special.My review will remain negative for a long time BECAUSE THEY ALSO INCREASED THE IN GAME CURENCY PRICES FOR BUYING VETERAN MEMBERSHIP"

You earn around 5-10k per game in the assualt mode or war mode, the matches you play within the modes take around 20-45 minutes. A new weapon (which isnt a starter weapon) will cost you around 100k - 200k+ credits, which means for a single weapon you will need to play around 7,5+ hours of the game, this if you earn 10k per match, which happens rarely, so it will take probably around 20+ hours for one single stock weapon. Besides that you have mods for your weapon to make it preform better, but to no suprise they are so expensive that if you want a good modded weapon you have to grind for another 20+ hours, and if you you use that weapon the repair costs are so high, you wont earn much credits after a game so it will take even longer to buy other weapons. so around 40+ hours of grinding for a weapon, you also have verchicles, planes, tanks, camo's etc. etc... so much grinding.. while there are only 5 maps, for war and assault, updates are rare and when there are updates they have little content. This game has been fully released but its not that different from the beta, really. The game feels clunky, this game is so arcady that trees do more damage than the shells of tanks. sounds arent that great, teams and weapons are unbalanced, new players have no chance in gold matchmaking against veterans.. all in all, its just a bad game, i dont recommend it. You will either regret the hours wasted you will never get back in your life or you'll get a love/hate relationship causing you to cant stop coming back."

This game was ""released"" in 2016 but had been in Beta since around 2013-14. Even back then it was an abysmal pile of sh*t. Not only was it EPITOME of ""Pay-to-Win"" (still is, but even worse), it also had atrocious sound (still does), hilariously crappy physics (still does), laughably awful gunplay (still just as bad, firing a 45. SMG shouldn't give me the impression of firing a f*cking airsoft gun in terms of sound and projectile trajectory). Remember how I said it's basically the definition of Pay-to-Win? Well, it is, but it's prices are also hysterically overpriced, and have been since BETA.. They already had Pay-to-Win as early as the f*cking Beta, more than 3 GOD DAMNED years ago they were ripping idiots off, and still are. You can download it for free, sure, but be prepared to pay for your Guns, Ammunition, Repair costs for weapons, Repair costs for vehicles, Vehicles, Binoculars, Repair tools, Explosives, you name it (ironically they also charge you if you want to name your gun), they'll charge it. Yeah, you read that right, you have to PAY TO REPAIR.. YOUR F*CKING GUN. This isn't an MMO, I SHOULDN'T have to pay to repair my stupid friggin' gun if I DON'T have to pay to repair the gaping bulletholes in my uniform and dryclean the bloodstains left from being spawnkilled via a Plane and Tank b u k k a k e (Steam censors that word, go figure) of self-loathing and money ill-spent by someone too sh*t to succeed at War Thunder.You might argue that ""Oh, but you can earn the silver token thingies (earned currency in-game are these little silver tokens, bought currency is gold), well you earn those things at a snail's pace, so have fun grinding  for 2 or 3 days straight to earn those silver tokens to buy a crappy gun you wish you'd never spent money on because there's no way to test weapons before purchasing, you'll be lucky if you even make it that far because 50% of all those tokens you'll earn will be spent in the meantime on repairs and resupplies. Another thing, if you ARE stupid enough, OR rich enough (you're one or the other, or both), to download this piece of crap regardless of my and many other's warnings.. Do yourself a favor and join the Germans, their entire playerbase consists of wallet warrior knobheads, so you'll be in fantastic company as you abuse Planes and Tanks to decimate helpless ground troopers in their own spawn."

Prepare to get shot many times by guys running around firing anti tank rifle from the hip i know ive done it so many times myself but hey they want it arcady. Ohh wait if i aim my gun an inch from the side of an object my gun will not be shootable because it was too close the game decided that position was unacceptable.

There are a myriad of annoying bugs which have been in the game since I played it years ago reto moto do not care about fixing the game they make it worse and hold thier hand out for your cash. this game will cost you more than most and keep you shilling out for it with little effort from the devs to fix basic gameplay.

The gameplay is taking a horrible direction, every advertisement/promotional video has goofy **** going on and it's nowhere near the 'Ultimate WW2 Shooter' as they call it. Walking and running is stuttering 24/7 as if it's in alpha, people cannot shoulder their rifles without arthritis, and there are only 2 or 3 people communicating per team out of a full game.The developers aren't taking this serious at all, and the gameplay is complete dog****. Flying tanks, flying jeeps, planes that crash into the ground and take off again are all good for promotions to them. I can't believe I spent almost 350 hours in this game, literally a waste of my time.I thought it would be a fun game, but no, grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind.I wouldn't even dare to try it if I were you, not worth it at all."
,Not Recommended,227940,29888427,Posted: 12 February,all,Spartanjcb,"Waste of 15.3 hours, In current state. Would not recommend.Things wrong with game:- Unbalanced gameplay between teams. US VERY underpowerd some of the worst guns in the game (especialy at the begining. Be better off beating someone to death with a shovel and then taking their gun.- Poor melee mechanics and hit detection. (I understand that hit mechanics may be difficult to impliment properly but this is the worst I have seen melee in a game.)- Very poor upgrade system due to everything needing upkeep and being absurdly expensive to buy with in game cash.- You will strain your eyes trying to see what pixels you are looking at through your sights. Only to be killed 3 sec after you figure out what it is, by someone who is more than likely using a magnifying glass taped over his screen.- Good luck when you get to the level where you can start fighting tanks you will struggle to go anywhere as tank damaging explosives are quite rare on 90% of the maps.- Most annoying thing is that death is near instant yet it will take you 1 min to get back to the fight. And thats if you have a jeep. If you are walking you might as well leave the fight then, because you finally get back to the fight only to die 2 seconds in and have to do it all over again.- Lastly the time it takes games to finish. Some games I have been in have lasted over an hour... of course not after waiting 10 min for the game to find a match for you. A solid 3 hrs of the 15 Ive played have been sitting at my computer playing on my phone while waiting for the next open spot in a game.Things I would do to fix the issue:- While the slight sight sway on the guns is more realistic, reduce it.- Slightly increase zoom on iron sights. Small difference but it can help reduce frustration by a good amount for new players.- Make melee do more damage to counter the lack of hitting or increase the range that melee can hit.- Add more rocket boxes but reduce their per shot damage and blast radius.- Reduce spawn time for spawning at vehicles... 30 seconds+ is too long.- Allow rewards at a reduced rate for people who leave early. Most people do not have the time to sit through such long games.- Remove upkeep required on guns/equipment or lower the price of buying new equip/characters.I hope this review could be of some use. As for me, I will not be comming back to the game. As of posting this the game has been uninstalled. I do however not want your game to fail. I do understand the amount of work put into games like this. I also know that you have to make money while doing it, so I understand why everything is so pricy. Face it, its new players that spend the most money not the Vets, if no new players play the game more then 1 time then you wont make any money at all. Its a fine line and Im sorry but I think you are currently on the wrong side."

,Not Recommended,227940,29534925,Posted: 27 January,all,PATRICKMANDEFENDEROFBIKINIBOTTOM,"19/05/17': Game is pretty much still the same, with some extra features here and there but most of the review remains untouched. It's a shame - and if cod ww2 really is 'back to the roots' this game might struggle. This is NOT an EA title anymore; the game you see is what you get and it's just not good enough (mostly adding content over fixing content). The biggest pro it has; it's F2P.First of all, the biggest issue is the latency. What happens here is that you will get shot by other players way earlier or you can shoot other players earlier. Simply because a bit of latency. Especially in FPS games, this will make you scratch the back of your head quite a lot. It's horiffic, i can't play the game because of this. You will notice this quite a lot in certain matches and it ruines your gameplay completely. My ping in the scoreboard has 3 bars.Germans have an OP 4x scope, while other nations don't. Snipers all over the place + One shot guns (a.k.a. 'sniper' guns) are 9/10 1-shot guns, which are completely uncounterable if you are in mid-long range, which is 9/10 of the time. Get it? 25% of my deaths are because of 'sniper' kills and in german matches probably more. The scope, OK, the gun, not so. As an LMG gunner (which has other issues) you can't shoot them at all. Even with other guns these weapons will one shot you any day. It just doesn't make sense (as a 'realistic' game). You will need to headshot them otherwise you're screwed and probably dead. Mandatory: reduced DMG perk.You can't use the tripods at all, which is the biggest advantage of a LMG or MG in general to put up strategic positions with LMG's or MG's - but you don't have the required ammo as well. (20 ammo - 50 ammo...???)Veteran membership isn't P2W at first, but it really is. Earning extra XP and money is ok, but with veteran you'll be able to get an extra ribbon and extra equipment slot - which goes into P2W imo. Someone who can equip two ribbons obviously has better stats then non-veterans. Equipping extra stuff is also 'op' compared to non-veteran (in terms of anti-tank soldiers and such - extra ammo always comes in handy). Then again you don't want to spend money on this game because it is just not good enough so there you have it, you'll always be in a disadvantage. You CAN purchase veteran with in-game currency; but you pretty much need to hardcore (No mods - disadvantage,...). A decent ELITE match (especially with bonus) can earn you 10K. You will always have to repair something so you're bound to repair costs. On average a game takes about 30-ish minutes (or should take); 30-days veteran = 600K. on average 8K for a (very) good soldier match; 75 matches * 30 minutes: 2,250 minutes (37,5h). This is only a representation on a perfect model. Good luck soldier...You're also forced to buy veteran membership because earning money is your daily grind. If i had to buy very expensive guns, OK, but i also have to buy expensive mods and vehicles, and don't forget about nades and such. That being said: once you finally bought that awesome mod you will probably have to pay 20%+ of your income towards this mod. Equipping two mods will most likely reduce your income by 20-50%, not even talking about using nades. When talking about nades this is a good thing - it prevents spamming, but then again you'll notice a lot of attic campers in-game. Therefore giving campers a huge advantage because you need to spend more money to kill them then you're earning.You'll need to earn money eventually; so you're stuck in a big grind. Veteran membership solves this because it will increase your income by 25%, which means you'll get your mod costs back (meaning the extra money earned simply goes into mods and nades).Spawn campers are very common. Apparently they changed the spawns a couple of updates ago - but they are pretty bad most of the time. You're too far behind your base and once you're out of your spawn point you can get shot (small zone - if you shoot you'll be reveiled or when walked out of the zone), some maps don't contain cover (or require a long walk through cover) which means you'll lose your point most of the times. Especially in war mode, once the jeeps or motorcycles are depleted, this will get on your nerves quite quickly. Especially on fuel depot - train station map this is a huge problem, but not here alone. Main problems here; no cover, no transport, no-kill zone too small,.. Players are also pretty selfish, not giving you a ride (wasting resources, one man ride) and most times you don't have a civilian bike or jeep to your disposal (because they are on the point lol).Exploiting: players are exploiting because you can obtain multiple characters in different nations (an ALT) - especially in WAR mode, players of the opposite nation will get in your team and spawn in APCs (to spawn), jeeps, tanks,... whatever they can waste. Then they drive of into oblivion, reveiling these vehicles to the enemy and next up is it being destroyed. Happens quite some times as i've noticed and nothing can be done against it. Which is my next flaw of this game;You can't enter other people's vehicles (drive position). Especially in WAR mode, you're forced to watch your resources and you can't spawn in vehicles endlesly. This way, if a selfish player spawns in their vehicle and doesn't use it anymore - it's lost. What's even worse: the vehicles despawn, meaning you WILL have to use (waste) your resources all the time to obtain new vehicles. If you go for a walk, your vehicle will despawn (even if not dmged or untouched) and you're forced to go for a walk again/spawn a new one in.Unoptimized gameplay: the game is unoptimized. I've noticed this in multiple games by now but i'm playing on a potato laptop - i'm using low settings and low resolutions. You'll get kill/assist messages which will get in the way when you're trying to aim. The spawnpoint markers and such also get in your way when aiming for enemies and sometimes don't go invisible (which should be the case). Next up is the FPS issue; if you join a game, sometimes you're forced to restart because the game has a lower FPS then before. If you restart everything is normal again (requiring you to walk again to the point, you despawned). Shots fired sometimes are 'deaf shots', which probably refers to the latency issue - enemies 'one shot' you - you only hear one shot, this will most likely let you know you're having latency issues. This also causes tanks to shoot multiple shots at once (and multiple explosions), it is pretty annoying. It's only one shot but you hear lots and see lots of them.Don't get me wrong, it is playable, but with a lot of drawbacks. The gameplay itself is pretty amusing and awesome but once you get the hang of it, these con's will get on your nerves quite a lot. I'm pretty sure if they could patch certain con's i've described the game would be a lot better and more amusing.TL;DR:- Latency issues.- Unbalanced gameplay (Scopes, Tanks, weapons,...).- Spawn Camping.- Exploiters / toxic community at times (bad community - not everyone!).- One-shot 'snipers'.- Certain weapon mods don't make sense: no extra scopes (to change your aim visual), tripod doesn't work,...- 75% P2W veteran membership (refering to ribbon, EQ slot and $$$ earned).- Earned $$$ doesn't add up to costs - becomes a grind if you want to be good (increased prices and decreased money earned was a patch). Expensive mods.- no tutorials AT ALL, figure it out yourself via wiki or YT.- Vehicle despawn / not able to drive.- Stuck with same EQ/squad - can't switch once in-game.+/- different EQ types (little variety in weapons and vehicles - not enough imo) - they did add more vehicles, it has more variety as of now (+).+/- unoptimized gameplay: they added an extra slider which reduces visuals over performance; but overal it still has issues.+ F2P with decent graphics.+ A lot to unlock (when taking ribbons and such in mind)."

The spawning system is obsurd, instead of allowing you to spawn at the points you capture or spawn on your squadmates it forces you to spawn super far from the points of contest. After a certain point the game will kick you and your squadmates from a match if you die a lot. The weapons require severe balancing and the base weapons are terribly inconsistant in both accuracy and damage. this game could be such a good game if the devs would just start giving a $#!%. The final compaint I have is the in game economy, Id rather pay 20 to 30 dollars upfront for the game than play a game where the guns and equipment are so expensive that the only way to progress in a time effective manner is to spend money.

First of all, there is absolutely no need to do so because I got to rank 13 I think with the Wehrmacht WITHOUT spending a single cent on this game. You level up quicker than you think. The devs have serious mental problems and thus do NOT deserve it. Especially gargamel, who operates the support system. He's one of the biggest dumbässes you could ever meet in your life, plus he is totally useless. An Indian guy with no knowlege of English/German/Russian or even a high school education could do a much better job than gargamel could ever hope to do in his entire lifetime.Yes, I played this game for a long time, so obviously it has potential. The problem is that it's management team really sücks. What we need is for the H&G players to go on strike or even better recruit the libtard crowds that protested Trump and have them protest RETO so they would actually being doing something useful. In other words, they would be protesting something that is honestly worth protesting.One of the few good things about RETO is that they give out a lot of free stuff such as ribbon boosters and free veteran memberships, probably as a form of penance for their massive incompetance.TL:DR DON'T SPEND A SINGLE CENT ON THIS GAME! YOU ARE THROWING AWAY MONEY INTO A LOST CAUSE!!! (Unless of course you always play the US, who gets OP gear because most of the US faction player base are fat American teenagers who steal their parents' credit cards and buy excessive amounts of gold with them just to spite their parents. Yes, it's true, they brag about it.)One of the good things about the game is when Anatur talks in German Army chat. He deserves to be in charge of RETO. That would be one of the first things you need to do in order to make the game great again."

I get glued to most games that start off free and almost require a monthly subscription.The problem I have is quite simple: If you want my money, you have to earn it. This game hasn't earned it.This game is not friendly to new playersI don't know how many hours I've logged, but I do know I've spent over half of my time in-game queued. If the wait was worth it, I wouldn't complain - but it's not.Your squad leader can dismiss you from the serverAfter waiting for about 10-15 minutes just to enter a game, a squad leader can apparently dismiss you at will. This has happened to me a couple of times. I'm sure he's just trying to make room for personal friends, but it's not helping new players adjust to the slow game style. Now I have to wait all over again for a match.Combat is limited to your rankAgainst all logic, the grunts have to wait the longest for a battle to open up.As a result, I see no reason to continue with this game. Advice to new players or potential new players: Don't get this game. It's not worth the frustration. Insurgency has a WW2 mod that's fairly active - it's better, and there are no insane waiting periods just for 10 minutes of combat.Don't get me wrong. I really wanted to enjoy this game. I've watched over 2 hours of video content just to learn the mechanics. But there's no point if I can't enjoy what I've learned."

Playing as a tanker you start off with an m2a2 which only has .50 cals, but even then getting the stuart you are put against tanks you cant even kill. Weapons take forever to get and germany has of course the best ones. Tanks are always down to a slug fest for whoever has the mpst health and better gun wins. (always germans).

This game is one of my favorites and I dont even have to spend a dollar on it. There is a lot of grinding to get anything within the game but it gives you something to work towards. There are so many things to buy and do that it will take a long time before you get everthing that you want unless you pay.
76561198051967737,Not Recommended,227940,30237950,Posted: 28 February,all,Seigyoko,"Well to start off EVERYONE HAS PARKINSONS! (especialy if they sprint 10m)The physics are propably from some other fantasy style world because i aint see♥♥♥♥♥♥like dat be done irl. The weapons especialy the bolt action rifles are waaaay too weak ( but dont be fooled you WILL get ohked by an upgraded one if you get hit in the pinky). Even though sniping is a most common practice to get a nice k/d the visibility in the game is terible unless you use a scope( perhaps because the developers can only see the wolrd through lenses???) and the game mostly takes place during sunset or dawn hours for some strange reason. But the worst of it all is what you go through during the gameplay. MatchMaking is none existant ( dont let the MM group of the weapons fool you, they dont matter at all) you WILL be pitted up against a team with tanks airforce and infantry with mostly automatic weapons while you only have 2 squads of paratroopers with the strating semi-auto rifle. Furthermore the weaponry of the fanctions is tottaly unbalanced (take note of the stg44/ger the ams36/ussr and the m1/m2carabine/us) As said before you will encounter men with some strange weapons like the ones mentioned above and you WILL want them(because the guy with the stg planed your whole squad 2m deep and shot down a recon plane while was single handedly capturing your last base(srsly it happens!)), but ""how can i get them"" you will wonder. HA! no worries for RandomSteamUser is here to help. The answer is: Through developing masochistic fetishes (ofc). The grinding through ribons and funds is ( i could write a whole book on that BUT ill just say) painfull. You will start with a semi-auto rifle and a soldier with parkinsons and partial blindness, you will play your first game and after you get your bottom touched in various ways you will notice a slight profit about 4k credits. As you keep progressing you will  notice that your turd of a weapon can be upgraded and you will proceed to do so, but as you get better (since you can now kill people in stead of just scaring them) and you rack up more kills and caps and various other things and increese your survivability your income will become decimated by the repair costs. You will buy a new gun, that you hope will be more suited to your gameplay and wont cost a kidney per match to repair, and since your buttocks have tasted the wrath of the snipers you chose to become one and buy a bolt-action rifle. WRONG! This new addition to your arsenal doesnt have the stopping power you thought it would and the slow rate of fire renders you uterly useless in close and point-blank range (meaning you will trmble at the shight of any and all urban areas and you wont ever get close to a cap zone since you got traumatised but a guy with rugedy old smg). You hate your life for that very purchase and buy an smg. The starting smgs ( exept the american m3) are all traps, low stoping power, low rate of fire, and are utterly useless beyond 25-30m. You coninue hating your life and become a tanker. The first tank you will get will be a female tank (without a cannon) and you will be matched with male tanks (with a cannon) you can make out the outcome yourself(tip: it involves the word &quot♥♥♥♥♥♥quot;). After you get a grip on the use of tanks and get yourself a decend one you will start to kind of like this game your ingame wallet though wont. your drop the tanks and become a fighter pilot. You quit soon after because the controls are criminaly bad so you chose the paratroopers. And that was the best decision  you made while playing this game. You can drop where ever you want, the paratroopers are usualy the elites of the team (especialy in the us even tough the m1carabine aint much to work with) and the repair costs are not that high. Drawback: you are paratroopers (you are meant to be surounded) your squad leader will be the most reckless of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s and wont know fear or woe but still be the best of the team and your plane will be usualy on fire when you spawn on it(if you see the flyin cow in your team dont, by the gods dont, rejoice. Yes you may be on a video but the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ cares none for transport planes). After all youve been through you decide to buy a new soldier you (if it wasnt your first choice) choose the ussr because you saw them once winning the war (it was the only time you ever cared for that). Well the russian teams are a mob. The languages most used in the chat are russian(ofc)>chinese(yes)>and english.You cry. So you swich to the german side where you realise that social(?propably not the corect term) status matters and you dont. There wont be any pick ups covering fire or ,some times, orders from your squad  leader if the biggots dont deem you worthy(srsly you need to become an one man army). If you are the squad leader and your subordinates rank bellow 6 they wont even notice your orders.At this point you realise you havent yet confessed to your first love, the snipers so as a german now you try it out. The german snipers are usualy elites top the point where there wont be any targets left for you. (the americans snipe in close quatrers (dont ask me why) and the russians are a mixture of the best and the worst). You switch back to infantry and you either shower your teammates with grenades claiming to be an italian who swiched sides or do nothing because your are conscripted soldier from france and you surendered but some how you manage to unlock the stg44 the best weapon in the whole bloody game. You love this chap but you dont have the money to repair it so you switch to a bolt-action with sidearm and grenades build that yields you 10k in a match with 5/3 kd with 40something kills 6 caps and a dozen headshots and repair costs of about 8k. You cry and write a similar review of the game.If anyone reads this, please find a way to notify me.Also, Ive been playing this game since it first came out (even though I dont have that many hours in it) but can anyone explain to me what that soldier salary thing is because I have never received it."

Many players suffer from a low framerate on both low and high settings, so there's no point of changing these. I have the maximum settings available turned on and my FPS can't raise above 115. In BF4 I have a stable 100 FPS framerate on ultra settings, so that's disappointing.Shooting has never felt so bad. Netcode is terrible. Close range ADS shot in the enemy - no. Enemy doesn't miss using a full-auto SMG firing from the hip - yes.Yes, H&G have a decent customization system, but it's terrible too. Because maintenance cost.Prices are way too high and you can't change that, because you'll hardly gain more than your base salary playing the game. Want to have your own customized gun? Then spend twice as more than you can earn. So customization is pretty dead.And the worst thing - balance. There isn't any. You won't have enough time to get even an SMG before entering the ""gold"" matchmaking group.

The admins do not do anything because the hackers pay actual money to purchase items in game. If you manage to find a well-balanced game without hackers, it can be fun. This happens very very rarely. Please, look at my hours played. I know what I am talking about. If you play in the game, American teams lose 9/10 games. This is not an exaduration.

Maintenance on modded weapons can be ridiculously high.There are some enjoyable moments I had with my friends, though.

I have to say, even through all of the micro transactions and campers, the constant grinding to get a gun, and the no killcam snipers hiding in the bushes, this game still rocks. I didnt spend a single cent on it (never will spend money on a ""free"" game like this, label it as free and i will treat it as such lol) and i still was able to have plenty of fun. The bigger maps are a little harder to get kills, but that is understandable as everyone is spread out. I must say, it is pretty damn realistic with infantry, tanks, and planes fighting all at once. If you attempt to run out in the middle of the battle like rambo, youll get your♥♥♥♥♥kicked, sniped, blown up, etc. You have to use stealth, tactics, and communicate with your team to be succesful. I didnt really see any pay to win aspect in this, but it does take a VERY long time to get enough money for a better gun or higher tier tank (by very long i mean like, this game is the worst when it comes to having to grind to get stuff) which is the reason why people spend money on the game. Good game, will entertain you for hours if you know how to be a little stealthy and use basic tactics. If you play this like call of duty, you will get whooped. Does require a fairly powerful pc in order to fully enjoy the game as it was meant to be though, thats one of the few cons. Great game, i definitely reccomend this."

Some fanboys might disagree with me on that but let's face it, if you can only get 2 perks simultaniosly when you have a premium (paid) account, therefore gaining advantage that a player without premium doesn't have - that's pay to win.Every weapon, vehicle, or weapon mod requires a shirtload of grind, days of it to be honest and it just keeps getting worse and worse. Yet of course you can open up your wallet and get all the stuff at a much faster rate, but it will cost you a LOT.Devs barely listen to their community, just check out the forums and you'll see that pretty much nothing have been done. Every decent suggestion anyone ever had was ignored. I guess they've been busy making weapon skins and camouflages (which is a fkn moneygrab) and complaining about bad reviews on the forum (I kid you not, they actually complianed about it)This game is a dead cancerous abomination that just haven't died yet.

If you are thinking ""Just keep playing the game to progress more."", then you were usually be right, but in this case it can take you DAYS to unlock even a new attachment for your weapon. Leveling is the main reason why I will never play this game again. Takes absurdly long, and the payoff is that once you level up, you get pitted against higher ranking players with better guns once again, how awesome. Oh, did I forget to mention that if you wanna level up at a normal pace, you can buy Veteran to help you?Before people say this game isn't P2W, it is. It is VERY P2W. You can buy any gun if you have money, any vehicle, etc. But first you need to rank up before you can buy them, right? Technically, yes, but if you buy Veteran, you can rank up much faster and become a P2W God on the battlefield.

,Not Recommended,227940,29816613,Posted: 9 February,all,Red,"Where to begin...I have sunk more hours into this game then I probably should have. I have been watching this game develop for quite some time and I have seen big improvements made too it. However, it seems with each step this game takes forward it makes two back.For a free to play game the game is not necessarily pay to win, but more pay to unlock. The grind in this game is ridiculous, I mean ludicrously long. And the worst part is they constantly make it longer, and are constantly increasing the prices on weapons and vehicles. Yes, though it is good for drawing in hardcore players, it does knock back most casual gamers. Which is not what the focus of a game should be. Because of this ridiculous grind, it basically gives you no other option then if you want good gear, you are going to have to cough up the cash (which I can say I have sadly fallen for). Which I think is absolute ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t for casual gamers playing a free to play game. I know that the game must make money somehow, however I personally would rather get rid of the free to play, and pay $20 to maybe even $30 US to purchase the game, scrap the ""repair system"" and the ""gold system"" reduce the grind and make everything level and credit based.Other problems.This game used to pride itself on being a free to play game that anyone with any set up could play. However, every update that comes out seems to create more and more optimisation problems and severe drops in fps for people on low end gaming computers and or laptops. Forcing many players such as myself to give up the game as it has become unplayable on their machines. It seems the focus of Reto has gone from making it a game for everyone, too making that tree in the far corner of the map that no one will see pretty. Gameplay over graphics Reto, that is what drew me to the game.TankingThe tank combat system in this game is simplified at best. Yes, there is strategy too it, however it’s not about, ""I'll go here to get the jump on this guy"" it's more like ""I'll hide hear for 20min of the game being useless while I wait for this AT (anti-tank) ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ on a bike buggers off to hell."" The tank combat in this game though simple, is difficult. I don't quite mind playing as medium or light tank, however, heavy tanking in this game is near on impossible. You are slow and huge thus easy to spot, and are often swamped by AT before you even get a chance to support the infantry, get to a good vantage point, or let alone fire upon an enemy tank. There needs to be large improvements that could be made to the anti-tank system in this game. Such as AT charges should be needed to be placed on set points of a tank and not just anywhere.TeamworkThe game is heavily based around teamwork, and matches can be won or lost very quickly depending on how well the team communicates. I like this aspect of the game; however it is hard to communicate through the type chat system quickly. I would recommend that if you do play this game with friends to use discord or TeamSpeak when playing this game.Now I know I have basically just blasted the crap out of this game, however there is one undeniable fact that I haven't mentioned.It is Fun.A lot of people say it is frustrating. Yes, it can be, however when played with friends this game is a great killer of time and even enjoyable.The game is challenging and good at hooking you in for hours of a time.There is a lot in this game that needs improvement, and it is not finished yet. Though they update it regularly and has not been abandoned by its developers.I look forward to the prospect that one day it, it will be finished. I hope the Reto team takes this feedback with open minds and moves forward with the goal to listen to the community and fan base, and make improvements where they are needed.It is kind of hard to summarise what I am saying about this game as I myself am conflicted as to whether or not it is worth playing. And At this point I am basically rambling. Though i will say this, if you have the patience to stick with this game (and a decent gaming rig), it might one day just pay off. Now that is a big if... and in saying that is not my decision to make for you. And I only recommend this game to people who have the patience to wait, and who are willing to support the producers of the game during its ongoing development.Sorry for the long post but I hope this has helped you in some way."

Also, the weapons you start out with are extremely difficult to use in my opinion.

But after leveling up, seeing the prices of the upgrades, seeing the funny amount of credits you get for a battle, getting rekted by full-auto machinegun players and tanks at low levels, and you are starting to see why you don't want to play this game.ProsIt is free to play.At first it's pretty easy to get long range kills, players are not really aware of themselves.It is fun to play with friends.If you get a machinegun, you can get 3-4 kills with it easily.ConsAt the second level, you will be reversing tanks, machineguns, sniper rifles, heavy machineguns, which are really hard to deal with with your sh*tty low-level stock semi-auto rifle, which has less damage than a BB gun.If you get in a battle with higher level players, who have light tanks or better trucks, you can get ready not to get many kills.Russian weapons are far better in any aspects than their german and american counterparts.The gunplay is awful.*TLDR*: This game tries to be a WWII fps shooter, but it can't really be one."

,Not Recommended,227940,30184369,Posted: 25 February,all,SudoFato,"This game is a PAY TO WIN FPS! The gameplay and maps are great and I recommend those very much, but if you aren't willing to shell out some bucks to make this game enjoyable then it's best to find a different game. The reason this is pay to win is the fact that you level so extrememly fast but make very VERY little money (credits) to purchase new guns, upgrades, or vehichles. The developers of this game are evil and only care about money!! You can unlock anything in this game for real money, plus if you pay for veteran ($15 for 30 days) you will earn more exp and more money per run which sounds good but is atcually awful! The more exp you gain the more exp players you will fight against and still not make enough money to get the upgraded weapons to stand any kind of chance. Not only that, but if you purchase veteran you will get a few extra slots to carry more stuff into battle making this even more pay to win. It's not fun running into a map with the starter gun while everyone else has tanks, planes and the best weapons with all the mods. It will take days of playing to just be adequte unless you pay money to unlock guns and such early. Even if you have Veteran status you will still need to pay to unlock stuff early or just play for days feeling weak until you get some upgrades. I highly DO NOT recommend this game! THE DEVS ARE EVIL MONEY GRUBBERS!"

,Not Recommended,227940,30129547,Posted: 23 February,all,Dennis Nedry,"This game is rather unfortunate as it seems to have contracted Call of Duty disease. Not only is the engine clunky and un-imersive, but you have to play (or $pend) loads in order to get even close to being on a even playing field with the enemy. Nearly all the games I joined already had the enemy up to 80% of the way to victory, but more often that not my team had far less players than the other. I've not played much and I doubt I shall be, as I do not beleive games should award people who have no life and spend all their time playing games or should force players into spending money in a 'free 2 play, pay 2 win' fasion. I do not recommend this game as a ww2 simulator and I do not recommend you play it at all. Funnily enough, I've had more fun playing Paladins (the overwatch rip-off) than I've had playing this, and that's saying something. What else... oh yeah, people never talk so it's extremelly difficult to work as a team.... uh... Just dont play it. Please. Oh yeah, I understand you have to make money somehow, but by trying to make it only through people buying ingame curreny, you massively limit the audience that will be willing to play the game. I would happily pay £5-10 on this game if it completely removed the current equipment system, instead balancing the guns and giving the player more options to start with, rather than a very bland rifle. I've heard there are some good ww2 mods for ARMA, and I suggest you look into that before playing this game, it's probably worth the money just for the extra detail, content and polish."
76561197972029716,Not Recommended,227940,30212372,Posted: 26 February,all,Mad Capper,"I would find it very hard to give this game a positive review, unless of course you like being endlessly spawn camped, playing on wildly mismatched teams, and having the game devs constantly ""tweaking"" the game to make it more (not really) ""playable"".Let me first bring up the un even team issue. For some unknown to me reason , most of the new players of this game start playing on the American faction. In my experience in the game ( over 1k hours atm) this seems to be a constant. So if you want to join and you are new try the Soviet side. I cant for personall reasons play or reccommend the Nazi faction. When you play this seems to be one of the largest problems, if you have experience most of your team won't. The game match system to keep the teams even fairly balanced in staged matches seems hopelessly broken with teams loaded with players with large in game experience vs. teams with very little. This is to be somewhat expected in the war mode of play but not in staged.If you like to play as a tanker you can, not really sure how you start this now, I've had a tanker character from beta when you just switched (it does cost in game credits) from an infantry to a tanker and start working your way up. Being a tanker can be fun at times but the inconsistency makes it tough. Then of course there are the AT clowns. We regulars have alot of names for them, rambos, commandoes, you get the idea. If you are in a tank especially a heavy, you are pretty much hosed. The lowest AT guy (anti tank) can carry mines or stickies, the mines they run up to you from behind place the mine on you and then shoot it, boom your dead. This wouldn't matter too much except that you have to pay for your tank spawns. Now as a high level tanker you can afford this, but as a low level tanker you lose credits, and it can be very expensive. The heavy tanks are especially susceptable to these attacks as they do not move faster than any infantry can move at a walk.Lets move on to the spawn camping: It does exist in almost every mulitplayer online game but i've never played a game where it is as widespread as this game. Every so often the devs change a few things on the maps to make it more difficult but when you cant leave the spawn in a tank, truck or jeep its a serious problem.Then I will bring up the devs:  For some reason when the game was in beta we had some pretty good maps with varied terrain and options for a lot of play styles. Yes these maps had some problems but instead of addressing the problems they made entirely new maps! WITH THE SAME PROBLEMS! Now i dont want to bash the guy who made them, they are pretty big and complex with quite a bit of detail but the management team that pushed this, needs to have their collective heads examined.  When you have thousands of players giving feedback about issues there has to be some really common threads, address them. Now for some other reason there are no published stats about the weapons you are using in game. For example how much damage does rifle x do with mod a c and e, or how much actual armor will this tank shell penetrate. Tank shells bounce off targets with alarming frequency, depending on who you are fighting. I would not have issue with this but they seem to not have considered that each shell might hit the tank or may have been aimed so as to hit the armor at 90 degrees for penetration.  For example a german tiger 2 is nearly impentrable from the front or sides even if you hit the sloping armor not at an angle but at 90 degrees. I've hit them myself many times when the first shot will penetrate and every subsequent shot will bounce off the exact same spot. One or two time I could understand but five while that tank is stationary? The devs also constantly tweak your equipment so as soon as you get used to it they nerf it and well its useless.  They seem to do this with most every piece of equipment in the game, tank armor, speed, shell penetration, manueverablity, same with rifles. Don't get used to what you have, next week it will be crap.The devs have also got some really weird stuff going on with the strategy side of the game that greatly affects gameplay on the first person shooter side. If a general has an Assault Team with low stats (like vision) you cant see the enemy very well while you play, yeah I did say that you might be fighting guys that are very hard to see, likewise if you have a good AT stats your team can destroy the enemy like nothing. It makes for bizzare gameplay.  I do not know if that is what causes so many people who play this to call hacks. Which is also as near as I can tell is also an issue. The devs say that they do anti hacking ""sweeps"" , sadly they do not do enough. I personally have watched playes on other teams use aimbots to shoot with perfect accuracy planes down with tanks from accross the map when the planes spawned. Wait let me rephrase that, THEY SHOT BEFORE THE PLANES SPAWN, and hit them 95% of the time as they became visible. I'm pretty sure i reported those 2 guys, saw them months later not banned, and was told by another player that ""that guy is really good! Hes got a utube channel"" to which I replied that he was cheating that I saw it on my own screen that there is no way to shoot that accurately with a tank from that distance.Soo after that long, rambling review, for the reasons I stated and others I didn't, I can't reccommend investing your time into this game. Its sad that I say this because I am one of many who paid them actual money."

It does require a lot of grinding, but once you get what you want you feel like you accomplished something.  If you are all about instant gratification this game is probably not for you because it does take time to get what you want but it is worth it once you get there.  As to hackers, I don't run into many. You do run into some aim bots which is annoying but mostly people don't hack.

But this game was such a dissappointment that I don't even want to waste my time going into serious detail. So allow me to say it straightforward.Heroes and Generals is a failed attempt at the money pit tactic.If you want to get anywhere at all in this game, you will end up filling the developers' tin cup, in order to earn weapons that should otherwise be availiable to you from the beginning anyway. I'll admit, I haven't played much of this game. But the fact I had to grind for an hour in order to earn a damn shovel has assured me that I will not sink any more time into it.Another quick buck, dead on arrival, generic shooter. Save yourself the time. And spend some money on an actual game as opposed to this wad of crap."
,Not Recommended,227940,30092295,Posted: 21 February,all,grandprinceubu,"My friend convinced me to give Heroes & Generals a try, and since it was free I figured I might as well.  I've played a few WW2 FPS games before, so I figured this might be some fun.  However 2.7 hours in I am already seeing quite a few shortcomings of the game that are quite discouraging for a newcomer to the game.  In no particular order, these are my criticisms of Heroes & Generals:1) No tutorial for you.Maybe one of the more glaring omissions from this title is thecompletelack of a tutorial for new players.  Though the controls are mostly what you'd expect from a title of this sort, some things weren't clear (such as how to go prone).  Rather than getting a basic training mission where a new recruit can learn the basics of gameplay or practice with the game's equipment, you are thrown right into the meatgrinder.  Make no mistake, itisa meatgrinder of a map where you're up  against more experienced players potentially with better equipment from the get-go.  Not the end of the world by any means but definitely not the best way to welcome someone trying Heroes & Generals for the first time either.  From reading in the forums, it seems there may once have been a tutorial in the past but it was removed.  Why this is the case I cannot say, but it is certainly quite headscratching.2) Everything other than your uniform and your rifle must be unlocked.Evenbasicequipment that a new recruit might have such as a melee option like a shovel or knife has to be unlocked.  Other FPS titles will give you at least one other method of fighting besides your primary weapon but not this one.  Superior weaponry being something to aspire to is fine and a way to encourage the grinding necessary to accrue enough in-game currency to unlock.  Basic equipment that would add balance to the game for a new player being the same thing is ridiculous.  Add to this that it appears one would have to grind for hour upon hour to even have aknifeand we've got a title that is very unwelcoming to new players.3) Long wait times.  Not really the game's fault, but because there aren't as many people playing it these days you're stuck waiting for quite a while to play a match.  I'm lucky if I can get into one after 5 minutes of waiting in the lobby, and times closer to 7-10 minutes are more likely.4) In-game limitationsEven if you forgive the shortcomings of a constant grind to even get basic equipment and waiting forever to get into a match with a rifle and a prayer, something else rather odd has turned up.  As a new player it's not even weaponry you have to unlock.  You can't evenride a bicyclein the skirmish maps, they're locked.  Why?  What on earth would motivate the game's designers to limit the new players necessary to keep interest in a title alive in such a silly way?  Whatever the reasoning, this means that you're limited to going in on foot from spawn points that are quite far from the battlefield.Considering all of these points, is the game worth a try if you're new?  It will really depend on if you're willing to grind for a very long time to be able to make things fun.  As things stand right now you get thrown into a match with no idea what you're doing from the get-go, don't even have a melee option to turn to and have to unlock everything from that melee option to riding a gosh darned bicycle in bigger maps.  You don't get all that much in game currency from the matches you're able to get into after long wait times, thus eroding at a willingness to keep on trucking until you get enough to do something useful.  It's not pay to win, but itisvery limiting, discouraging and brutal for someone who's just getting started.  If you have the patience to wait it out and grind up to getting better things, and you have the free time to put toward this title despite its many shortcomings, feel free to give it a try.In its current state, wherein a new player is so severely limited and unsupported in efforts to learn the game or even stand much of a chance to have fun, I can not reccommed Heroes & Generals.  This is especially true with superior titles available out there which alloweveryoneoptions in matches beyond a single weapon and which allow for easier learning of the game.  Heroes & Generals in its current form seems to hate new players and is so infatuated with 'grind to unlock' that it will erode your patience.I don't mean to harp on the same things over and over, but the fact that you have to grind endlessly to be given theprivilegeto use a shovel, knife orride a bicyclepretty much says everything you need to know about Heroes & Generals."

I’m with H&G almost since beta release and still very excited about it.H&G is a hardcore and intelligent shooter with deep customization options and realistic weapon balance – aiming and killing is much more difficult comparing to BF for example. Since you cannot “shoot everyone in the head while running” or “camp with a sniper rifle” (recon class is not OP for many reasons) the gameplay requires a cooperation and strategic approach.The game has its unique style and atmosphere; you feel like watching old WWII movies. You can spend hundreds of hours in game and it will be still SO much to learn, so many builds and loadouts to experiment with. You can become a deadly CQC infantry or a machinegun defense specialist, fighter pilot or a tank driver.As for the negative aspects, there are certainly here. H&G has NO FACTION BALANCE. The most skillful German faction is being continuously nerfed, their weapon is seriously underpowered now, I won’t wonder if once the developers decide to put off one wheel from their cars to make Germans win even harder.Some maps (Mountain town, for example) have design flaws which leads to spawn♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and the worst thing that devs (Reto-moto) ignore most of the reasoned suggestions on their forums.Unfair weapon nerfes, increased repair and weapon prices, bad map redesign and poor faction balance are turning off veteran players. New ones could be overwhelmed by game’s deepness and difficulty but nevertheless I would strongly recommend it to every wargame lover."

,Recommended,227940,30122514,Posted: 23 February,all,SeanLaFox,I recommend this game greatly. The community needs to grow..people complain that this game is pay to win but i dont see how. People pay real money for this game dont get anything special that the free to players don't. Thats what makes this game pretty great. I will say it's  a grind if your not pay to play but the grind is so much fun and doing the grind helps you learn the game and you really need to learn this game because it has such a difficult learning curve. I've tried to get friends in this game but after a few matches they get upset and complain that the guns arnt balanced which i like. I don't think that an m1 grand should one shot you ( though it would be realistic) because its a starter weapon. The late game weapons is what makes the grind worth it. The slightly underpowered starter weapons are there to make you a better player because as you grinf through the game with the starter rifles you will get better at head shots which in this game is what you always want to go for. Every rifle one hit kills at a head shot. It's a fun game with a kinda small community but i think the people that leave bad comments or don't recommend this game are kind of missing the point and not taking the time to really learn this game.

While this game has a lot of potential The devs ruined it. Its as plain as that. They fixed things that didnt need fixed and ignored key game mechanics that quite frankly, NEEDED fixed. Now i don't have a whole lot of hours in the game but I've played plenty long to know some of the problems.Now for starters....Tanks. they're too expensive and you get payed next to nothing for killing them: a lose lose situation for both the tanker and the enemy. To destroy a tank at long range you need a bazooca... right? Only thing is it costs over 3 k per shot and it takes like 3 to kill a tank.Which means you wont get enough money to cover the first shot alone.I think you can do the math. Another problem is the game is not very inviting to new comers.There are a lot of machine guns and a lot of snipers out there for a newbie with a 3 hit kill M1 grand. Meaning once you die to the machinegun that some guy whipped out you have to walk all the way back.Long respawn waits and long distances to cover.It's enough to tilt more than a few people. That,topped with the fact that the devs are releasing very poor updates will cause the game to slowly die.Which is a shame.I do sincerly hope that Reto will pick it up and really fix this game.However,in it's current state i can not recommend this game."

I had plenty of ""fun"" participating in match as US without single tank, bazooka, or even AT grenades vs Germans with Tiger 2. typical f2p balance.Game itself is really refreshing, as it returns to the ww2 style, when almost every mainstream shooter is still about modern or futuristic combat for a very long time (at least Battlefield 1 brought something different).The game has a lot of content, but id dosen't matter as it gets forever to unlock anything, as you even can unlock the tree once to play m4 Sherman easy eight, but if u want to go to russian or german tank, all right everything from the start, sloooooooooooooow grind.quite long queuesMost important thing UNBALANCED MATCHMAKING as can be seen by example with Tiger. After few levels of playing with my lvl co-players i was thrown with my garand aggainst paratroopers with mg, assult rifles, soviet snipers, heavy tanks and planes. Everything i could do was to modify my garand or buy m3 grease gun for all money i've got. No view to even unlock simple bazooka, not mentioning paying for it.I've seen this in other f2p shooter (ghost recon i think) but it's simply outrageous practice for developers. You have to spend part of your slowly grinded money to be able to throw grenades.Game itself isn't bad, but as it is with most f2p games it's unplayable, not entirely p2w, cause if you spend enough (and by it i mean ENOOOOOOOOOUGHHHHH-""hella lot of"") time, you will get things to particpate in battle, as equal to the veterans. But before then, you will be forced to be cannon fodder, unless of course you can shoot very vell with Garand (still won't destroy this tiger 2).Play only if u have money to spend on this game (sic!)

Add on top of all that the fact that the developers seem more concerned with adding eye candy (New uniforms! New gun skins! New vehicle skins!) and finding new things to get the potential player to have to shell out real cash for (weapons upgrades, vehicle modifications, and even character progression all require 'gold', which is available to accumulate in game at such a slow rate as to be virtually nonexistent unless you buy it) to stay competetive in a 'free to play' game, and you get a product that's little more than a complete waste of time and effort and a frustrating batch of pretty graphics with no substance at all behind it.Had good potential once upon a time, but a complete waste of time and hard drive space now."

"" give people something like ( For example on the american side ) a grease gun and a 1911 with the rifle, same with the germans ( Getting a MP34 and a Mauser C96 ) and russians ( Tokerav and PPD40 ). It would promote more varied playstyles with begginers and could give them a chance to do better instead of being given a simple rifle adn uniform.3: The credits system ( and mabye the prices for the guns as well )Why: The credits system requires nothing but grinding matches to get even a sliver of credits you need to buy a single gun.Solution 1: Make you get more credits the more you kill, the longer you stay alive, or whatever other way. Generally give more credits per battle instead of like 100 credits.Solution 2: Make everything cheaper, but keep the normal credit earning thing the same."

Your gun movement feels very unresponsive and strange.If you are used to FPS games with responsive gameplay like Squad, Battlefield series, CS Go, Red Orchestra, Half Life series or even Call of Duty you should stick to them.A minor issue is that the graphics are no where near to the screenshots when everything is maxed out at 1440p.If the game would fix the movement and gunplay it would actually have potential and I would probably recommend it.

I played already about 100 matches, but in about 60 of them were at least TWO hackers in the german team (of course, there are russian hackers). Aimbotting, Shooting through walls... which make me come to the NEXT POINT:There is a large variaty of weapons to buy, but you have to play many matches to buy one. And if you go team USA, well, let's just say you fight with a stick that makes noise and NO DAMAGE. Which makes me complain about ANOTHER THING; BALANCE. America has the WORST WEAPONS, while Soviet and Germany has the ABSURDLY OVERPOWERED WEAPONS. Which makes no sense, because after all, the USA won after all- so WHY THE HECK DO THE LOSING TEAMS HAVE THE STRONGEST WEAPONS?SITUATION: Me running to the frontline: German with Carbiner bodyshots me and instantly DEAD.

Back in Beta it use to be US vs Germany with Germany wining most of the wars. Shortly after players starting to cry to the game Dev's Reto on the fourms that US is so hard to play... Which slowly caused Reto to nerf the german weapons with nerf after nerf with a few ninja nerfs here and there. While still in Beta the Devs released another faction to play with the hope to bring some life back in H&G with a few new weapons and tanks which was healthy for H&G. They gave the US a Johnson LMG and then gave the Germans a STG44 which brought the germans to fair fighting grounds with the US yet again  but after more US faction cry babies on Reto forum, Germany's weapons yet get another nerf, the brand new STG44 received a nerf along with more nerfs for its other weapons. Germany at this point is almost not playable and veteran players are saying hell with this game as it seems that Reto is completly biased toward the US that is why I do not recommend this game to my fellow gamers here on Steam here is the evidence as where Reto favors the US faction and basically nerfs the Germans until we stop playing... Take a look at this Damage/ Equipment Slots compared to what the Germans have to work with every single US faction weapon over powers German's and Soviet's. I just recently found out the Devs play their own game which is common but to be biased to their own faction is kind of low in my own opinion.

Unfortunately I'm Italian and i feel a bit like the reto-moto is forgetting about this country that actually fought in WW2 expecially because the game is not being translated to my language. I personally think that an Italian translation oughts to be one of the first translations as there also is a very big community of Italians playing Heroes and Generals and sometimes they even stop playing the game. I wonder why do you translate in Ottoman and Czech and not in Italian? Obviously respecting these two beautiful languages (expecially turk which sounds fantastically) I don't see any reason to just snob Italian and keep translating to the most unusual languages you can find. If you don't have any Italian working in Copenhagen you can put on the community a list of sentences to translate and I am sure there will be plenty of players sending you plenty of translations. I hope my comment can be helpful for future develpoing
,Recommended,227940,30063075,Posted: 20 February,all,Dr. Doop,"Heroes and Generals is a FPS game that is a lot like Battlefield if it were based in WWII.. You have huge massive maps and you also have have smaller more confined maps. You can drive tanks, bikes, motorcycles, armored trucks, transport trucks, airplanes, and the list just keeps going. You dont have to spend a single dime in this game but it sure does speed up your progression a lot. I have only spent less than 10 dollars on the game and all i got was some ribbon boosts and a new character slot.While playing you will advance in different matchmaking brackets like bronze, gold and etc. You will eventually start to see different types of players from tank drivers to air planes .. this is where the game really starts to kick off and get very interesting!!Hearing the planes fly over your head and the tanks in the background give you a realism feel you wouldnt believe and just have to experience for yourself. You have 3 different factions you can choose to play at any time you want, American, German,  and the new Soviet Union. Each with their own theme based weapons and vehicles.Leveling is very time consuming and not so rushed like other FPS games of the genre. You cant be max level in a couple days like will be on COD or Battlefield. Though you can get ribbon boosts or even get veteran which is the paid sub version of the game that increases Xp gains for the weapons, character and etc. I do have veteran status which i can say does increase your xp quite a bit but not to the point that you are just slamming through levels at an ungodly rate.. The game has yet to become boring for me and i just cant see it happening for quite some time!!I do not think the game has a unusual amount of hackers like most would make you believe, I have only experienced one incident with what would seem to be a hacker teleporting rapidly all over the map .. but it could have been some kind of glitch whos to say??If your really into FPS games and WWII type of gameplay pick this up, i promise you will have a blast like i have been!!"

I feel that the pay elements are well balanced so it dosn't feel like a pay to win structure like some others. There is a massive problem in the comunity with aim bots and the such. Infantry gameplay seems to start out slow, and you need to get used to dieing. I have a few friends who are not used to loosing so they trow a fit every time I get them in game. It takes patience, especcally when the starting guns suck, and suck bad. But once you git past the initial grind it is great. One of the major problems however is all the vets seem to play on germany, america, and russia from what I have seen have very little team-play. All over its worth checking out."

Besides you need those first couple days as a grunt to really understand whats going on and what the assorted objectives are. Its a great way to keep people who have played for 5 minutes from crashing all of your planes / tanks in the first few minutes of the battle.You can unlock vehicles / weapons one of two ways:1. Simply play the game. Your soldier is paid a ""salary"" for every battle he is present for at least 50% of. You can then spend this currency on unlocking new weapons / vehicles ect...2. The game is free to play but the developers do still need to get paid so if you really dont want to wait before you can drive that one specific tank then for 5 bucks or so you can buy ""gold which can be spent just as the other currency but in its own denominations.I will say I am pleased that the pay to unlock is kept fairly well in check as it would require a considerable cash contribution to buy your way into every area of the game...I would classify it more as a ""support the developers"" than a pay to win scenario."

The grind is tough, but with time and skill you can easily excell in the game. If you don't want to wait, then spend a little money and get the weapons, mods, and ranks that you can't wait for.They also regularly update the game with new maps, guns, and features. Each time they update the game seems to become a little more difficult for a couple of weeks until another small update fixes any imbalalnces.

I also recomend playing a game for a bit longer that just like 1 hour to form your opinion.Long rewiev: A lot of people seem to not like this game for many reasons one is that it is poorly optimised, i dont have any problems with the game im using a 5 year old acer G3620 and the game is running just fine. Other people say it is pay to win and yes you can unlock everyting by paying if you like usually a problem with free to play games, however you can also unlock everyting just by playing. It is a bit of a gring but everytime you get a new weapon or a tank it feels really rewarding since you have worked for it for a long time.Misunderstandings about the game: I often see coments like this""the other team had tanks and just spawn camed us"" that happens some time and I guess you played a war battle if one team has anyting the other doesnt. In the war other players decide where to place the recorces so sometimes battles can be unbalanced (i guess that is kind of realistic tho).Another one is that this game is just pay to win. Like i said you can unlock everyting by paying, however you can play the game and get everyting for free.Conclusion: It is not perfect but what games are theese days, I do recomend that you give the game a go.

Though at first it may seem cheap that you have to unlock different classes it is totally worth it. It lets you prevail over the newcomers and go your own path. Having played 106 hours on my current account I have gained access to the pilot, tanker, recon, and of course infantryman. The feeling of your first match as a tank or fighter pilot is simply unforgettable. Another huge plus is that weapons and vehicles have been balanced to the point where you will get something new every 2 or so hours of play through the credit system.

,Recommended,227940,29766911,Posted: 7 February,all,Hawkeye4040,"One of my favorite Free-To-Play FPS Games. I love war-mode and how strategy is implemented there. This game is not very noob friendly though, you will have a very difficult time starting out even if you have a lot of FPS experience. This makes a lot of players whine like little babies, but personally I love the challenge and the fact that it gives you the ability to build up your characthers in true ""grinding"" fashion like you'd see in RPG's.They've had numerous issues in the past and have, overall, been very good at fixing them in a timely manner. It used to be when I started this game you couldn't lay prone because there was a physics collider issue with the weapons/ground. It didn't take them too long to fix (considering this likely meant updating all the models from box/polygon phsyics colliders to mesh colliders that conform to their parent mesh rather than making a box around it).The only negative aspect I really find is the same as ususal: the players. They whine and are annoying as hell but can just be ignored for the most part. That's not really on the devs though you could have that in any game so I wouldn't count that against them but there is a lot of it in there.Its a free game though so certainly worth checking out, friend me and join my squad if you need help."

Especially in a free to play environment where you're forced to play with free to play ♥♥♥♥♥ies even after subscribing.If you play this switch to paratrooper and get late release and a smg asap, it makes the game much more fun and because you only have one weapon it makes  credits like crazy. If you do buy premium, use late release and raider so you don't have to return to an ammo box and risk death periodically. Maybe use extra hp, it depends on how many bolt action memes are around. Later, get a sniper to general so you can switch the one shot rifle to a different class, like paratrooper.Seems really p2w as a general, and don't play german tanks, they're♥♥♥♥♥♥ If you want to do anti tank work, use mines and ride around on a bicycle. Don't forget to name them ""Play a real class""There are some hackers too, but the game engine is old.

Though if you do you'd be spending alot of money on it since buying and leveling things is very expensive.Match making when your the newest of the new isnt so bad, but after you played more then 5 rounds or more you start going against players who have actually been playing the game or pay to win. and at the point you should be in for some frustration because the starting guns are very very inferior to every other gun in the game.its a good game, i just feel like certain things can be executed better, like matchmaking but that hard when there only maybe about 3,000 players on at a time."

A LOT. Does it meter? not realy. i had a lot of good times despite the broken spawn system (with spawn protection most problmes were fixed, but even before). the grind system is anyoing, but if what you want is gear it isn't the best game for you. to be honest, i think the lack of comunication is what truly mising in his game (if a voice chat would have been add a lot of new player could enjoy, clans are suprsingly fun). sure gmae isn't what it could have been. however it is amusing. as older player said, some will love it, some will not.Updates aren't realy focusing on the problem (and frame per secend lock could help a lot of frame drop that hapnes ) but the game is plished inoth to be enjoyabe, as long as you have good internet conection (sadly thats the truth)i would give it 7/10 in a scale, but it realy isn't your cs go or cod noraml fps. it is a game with it's own story. some pepole just don't like that kind of fps. It is fine, however dont blame it all on the mecanics. the gmae just take time to study (took me 10h antil i got the besics, but it might be harder if you try to play it like cod or cs, which a lot of new player do and to be honest, i think thats one of the resens a lot of noobs tend to leave the game early)you should try it, i havn't played a game like it before. you might find the conspet intersting at the end."

If you are used to small maps and arcade style battles, you might not enjoy this game. If you enjoy unlocking everything easily, you may not enjoy this game.If you enjoy massive, pitched, and stratigic FPS WWII gameplay, then this is the game for you.If you run out blindly across the open field expect to be sniped. If you play stratigically, you may just make it.In short, this game is not for everyone. I personally love it though!"

76561198134797269,Recommended,227940,29596583,Posted: 30 January,all,Harv,"So I guess it's time to make a review about this game. First off this was the first game I ever got on steam, the amount of money that me and my brother have spent on this game is well over $100. Was it worth it? Probably not, I played this game when it first came out and getting the best guns wasn't that much of a problem, the only thing you had to worry about is wheather or not your account got hacked. This game is awesome and I'm really happy that it finally came out of the beta stage (seeing the giant text on the top right of my screen saying BETA, was getting annoying), and it has protential. I could probably go as far as to say that it's the best free to play ww2 first person shooter right now, 2017 however does seem to be bringing back those classice ww2 shooters, so this game will have competition in the long run. Overall, I would this game 8/10."
,Recommended,227940,29713300,Posted: 5 February,all,SteelerRies,I find this game fun and entertaining. I love the authenticity of everything!
,Recommended,227940,29792701,Posted: 8 February,all,Yodaloo,"This is my first review, so don't judge too harshly!The Gameplay: Heroes and Genrals is an action packed FPS, with amazing quality for a FTP game. The infantry sections are meh, but the Tank and Aircraft sections are GLORIOUS (especially with the new updates!)The Strategy Element: Alongside the FPS section, there is a mini RTS game. You send assault teams on different areas on a map of Europe during WW2. The RTS game is pretty simplistic, so if this is why you want to play the game don't bother. It also takes a long time to get to it, I haven't even gotten to it! And, you can see my playtime.The Community: This is where the game falters. I play as America, and we have stereotypes for the other nation's players. We have ""German pansies"" and ""Russian ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.""The Germans usually rush you in an infantry situation, and they usually one shot you with their starter rifles. The Russians camp the same area, usually with a tank or vehicle if they have them, and they snipe you from the same position as you try to get a waypoint. The Russian planes were also OP before the latest update. You can see why I wanted to play as Aircraft since I first got the game.The PTW aspect: This game is heavy on it's pay to win aspect. There is a currency called gold, which is the Preminum currency. With it you can buy everything in the game AMAZINGLY quickly. If you have a couple hundred to spend, you could level up your infantry men to have the best auto gun in the game, with the best mods, the best ribbons (perks) and the best grenades without playing a single round. For the rest of us, though, we have to spend literally WEEKS, maybe even MONTHS on grinding just to get the next gun or vehicle. In short, the PTW aspect is♥♥♥♥♥♥Overview: Even with all it's flaws and falters, the game holds a unique charm. I actually unistalled the game, but once they updated it and fully completed it, I came right back in. I am in fact writing this review as I wait for the next game to que up. Or at least I was, till the game I was playing started it's Russian ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.7/10 GREAT GAME. MUST HAVE FOR FREE"
,Recommended,227940,29861557,Posted: 11 February,all,einstein_101,"For a free to play very fun. The pay to advance gold isn't as good as you might think so you are better off just grinding away unless you have a bigger budget than a colledge student at McDonalds. Love the community and the global war map. The fight down line objective system is amazing as many games like Command and Conquer or Dust 514 have you running around like a chicken with your head cut off when your team doesnt hold A or E, this allows your team to hold one objective as a choke point for better defense. Great look for a free game as well, kinda like a beefed up version of COD 3 or MOH Allied Assault.Becoming an officer and getting your own battalions makes you feel in control, like you actually make a difference. I put 200 Hours into this game the first 2 month I owned it. A must play for every FPS lover."

,Recommended,227940,29857110,Posted: 11 February,all,nlSpeer,"Playing this game a lot lately and it's fun to play.There are, however, a few points that I don't really like.The balance between earning and spending rate is quiet bad. It takes a while for you to be able to upgrade weapons and vehicles etcetera.As you level-up your player the earning rate goes up which takes quiet a while IMO.Travel time between point A and B is not that bad, there are plenty of bycicles to find.I'd recommend this game to players that don't mind the things said and that don't mind being killed by OP guns or planes all the time.cons:- Earning rate is slow.- Weapon balance is off.- Every bullet has a cost.- Lag, not every game has it but it happens often.pros:- Guns very customizable, you can upgrade them with pleny of options.- Going to battle with a bycicle, I mean, who doesn't want to do that?- The gamemodes are fun to play, especially if your squad listens to it's leader.This game needs a lot of improvement. The maps are all alike and this game has potential to grow inro a way better game. I still play it, however, it can get boring after some time."

,Recommended,227940,29934691,Posted: 14 February,all,Actiongameinc2,i honestly love this game and the detail put into the game. its much like the game war of thunder but it shows so much more into what world war two is like. if you wanted to man a tank you would have to get other players to man it with you. instead of being able to run everything yourself. sure you can drive and man the main gun but each and every system like turrtes and stuff function as a whole. i tried this game out a while back and its been through many computers. on the first tries i never got it to work. finally i got lucky. my new computer worked well. the problem is not for long. once i got into the game i started to exsperiance frame drop and very bad trouble running this game on my system. i tried getting aplications that help the game run smoothly. and even tried to follow tricks on youtube. and well the last resault was i could get games of at least assault rank to run on my computer with the window render quality down to close to minimum quality. the game still looked good even at graphics low enough for a good performance. but for people on windows 10 computers who still have intel graphics and stuff built into their computer this game can not be played. it sadened me when i found out that my computer was the problem and that i had no choice but to pull the plug on my grand ww2 adventures. but all in all i think its cool. i just wished i could unlock my tank right before i had to leave. if anyone can help me get back into the game it would please me a lot and i promice good reveiws on this game in the future.

If you play this go Germans. if you dont you are already a massive disadvantige and lvling takes so long with almost nothing gained per lvl up. this game could of been great but it was ruined.

At first it's pretty difficult and you have to do a lot of grinding, but after a little while you'll get the hang of it and you'll have some nice weapons to fight back with. The reason matchmaking is slow at the beginning is due to the fact that you can only fight in one game type, but later you unlock multiple game types and it's very fast. Overall very fun game, especially if you play with friends."

You can find some ways to have fun, Grenades are op, So one way to have fun is replacing your entire loadout with grenades and grenading everyone. Fun in my opinion atleast, But if you want a serious game where you fight for you country? Would not say this game, If they made it so we had to pay one time for the game like all other steam games? and we got the game without the pay to win part and they balanced alot of stuff? It could be a great game. So if you like bad games where you can mess around to have fun? I recommend it, If you want a good World war II game? I don't recommend it."

An insane amount of equipment & vehicles to use and a variety of ways to fight/contribute to battles.  Very good gameplay feel for the FPS.Most bad reviews are from people who were banned for hacking or those who only wanted to do one aspect of the game all the time (100% tanker for instance) and were disappointed the game wasn't tailored only for them/their playstyle.Unfortunately there are some aspects that are partially pay-2-win, like getting access to 2 game-changing badges instead of 1, and faster earnings.  However, it is still possible to grind/earn membership without paying for it.  Overall new 100% free players can be very effective and successful with starter weapons if they are experienced FPS players.RTS map is overall buggy and still has issues with autoresolving unplayed matches, which needs to be changed in the future.  The developer is continuing to fix issues and improve the UI significantly.Combination of small development team and a very inpatient community of players results in lots of complaining and exaggeration.  Give the game a try."

At this point, they care more than Reto does.TL;DR: While there's a lot of bad to the game, it's still an entertaining experience and worth checking out.I've been playing Heroes & Generals since the Quesada update (circa July 2014).  I have over 2000 Steam hours on the game, and plenty more using the browser version.  I've also streamed this game for well over a year.  After all that time, I can honestly say, this is the game that you will love to hate.  It is not a bad game, but there's so many things that have changed over the years that have brought down the quality while increasing the cash-grab aspect that I feel people need to take a good, hard look at whether they want to invest the time (and money) into this game or not.There are so many things mismanaged with this game, and far too many issues with modeling.  Reto Moto utilizes its own engine, rather than an off-the-shelf engine with more capabilities.  Consequently, you will see a noticeable drop in FPS compared to other games with similar requirements.  The engine has not receiving an update in over 2 years.  We only recently received significant updates to the maps, and those updates consisted of questionable spawn locations, more rehashes of the same tired old buildings, and some color differences.  Destructible terrain is non-existent, and you'll find that glass is bullet-proof for the first shot in addition to improper edge modeling of buildings and objects.Everything in this game can be ground out, but the cost of doing such has steadily increased over the years.  Most recently, the latest patch decreased the credits earned per hour while slightly increasing the cost of some highly-purchased items.  This, along with a slight increase in the cost of gold, has pushed the game to more real-money purchase of gold.  There is no doubt that Reto Moto is doing this to reinforce its dwindling coffers.  Make no mistake, Reto Moto is an indie studio with a small budget trying to pull off a AAA gaming experience.  Therefore, the cash shop is their sole source of income to keep their doors open.  The more use there is, the better for them.My last bit of bad review is centered on the development team, and especially the game director (RedBjarne). Priorities for this team are sorely mismanaged.  I say this as a developer myself, and shudder every time I see a decision to go after cash-grab opportunities (such as adding new tanks/guns) instead of fixing long-standing bugs (double-shot glitch has existed for 2 years with no resolution).  I personally feel that RedBjarne is harming the development of the game rather than helping, and is known for his egotistical attitude towards others.Despite all of the bad, I still recommend this game.  Why?  Frankly, there's only 2 WWII infantry-based MMOs still in existence, and this one has the larger community.  I've met some tremendous people through this game, and the Twitch-streaming community is the most tight-knit group I've seen.  We all support each other, and you'll never lack for an entertaining long-time player within that community.  If you have several years (or deep pockets), the higher-end weapons and tanks are awesome, and you'll definitely have a lot of fun.  Cheating, despite what most people think, is still relatively minor compared to the AAA titles out there (it does exist, though).  If you find a good group to work with, you'll be amazed by how different the game is versus just running solo.I'd highly recommend that you check the game out and hop in a few streams.  You'll find plenty of us (myself included) that are willing to show new players the ropes.  If you stick around, maybe you'll be in this place 2 years from now talking about the game you love to hate."

I have over 200 hours and not once have i seen a single hacker and tend to believe liek many other games its simply butthurt people crying. As for gameplay, another argument i hear is that defenders spawn closer to the objective then attackers..... well ya, your attacking lol XD. If the attackers spawned on the objective they were trying to attack would it really be attacking? On a serious note though this game is free, go download it, spawn in a game and make sure to stay in cover and at range with the starting rifle and see for yourself if its your game. Give it a few hours, if u are interested keep trying, its definetly one of those games you wont be good at right away. All in all i love this game and would highly recommend giving it a try."

,Recommended,227940,30117397,Posted: 23 February,all,Khairules747,"Ze game which most people think Ze German is overpowered.Okey... Time to begin the review of this game.If you had visted my profile, you will know that this game is the game where I put most of my hours in. The thing about this game is that you have to grind... and grind... and grind... to get anywhere in this game. The game is the the product of Reto-Moto. If you do not have any idea who are them let me enlighten you about them. Who here knows the Hitman series? No one? That is weird. Well that is probably the result of writing the review alone. Alright so no one in this room knows what am I talking about. So Reto-Moto is a small company whose team mostly consist of people from IO Interactive the same company who made Hitman 2016. Okey everyone understand me? If no one raise there hands i will continue. Okey no one? Lets move on than.Graphics:Really nothing impressive. It used to be more bland (more on the other side of the contrast bar) but because of that my potato could run it at about 30 fps (in an open area). Now the game is more vibrant (for example the grass is more greener). So overall 7/10 (sorry Reto-Moto)Gameplay:What do you expect... Space Lazers from Nazi Germany? Of couse not. (Seriously were you expecting that?) Well as much as Reto-Moto tries to make the game as historically accurate as possible, I still do not get their weapon choice. For example, the new heavy class fighters. They added the ME 410 which was a mid-war development plane while in contrast a update before they added the O-52 Owl. Which a bit of background info is a outdated plane when the war start. See the technology difference? Well all be it the two tier difference between them but there is a possiblity they will meet each other in the sky. It is also not about the planes but also the guns the biggest gap in the technological difference is between the c47 pistol which served the first world war to the second world war and the m1/m2 carbine which only served late into the second world war. All be it that one is Carbine and the other is a pistol. But other than that the guns are reletively balanced. So well done Reto-Moto. 8/10 (minus one point for being exclusively multiplayer). Well this is an after thought, Because the game requires a lot and empasis on A LOT of grinding, minus one point for that (so sorry Reto-Moto) 7/10.Community:The community (unlike most exclusively multiplayer games) is actualy supportive. So yeah 10/10 (well done Reto-Moto for supporting the community)Historical Accuracy:Well only for games who tries to be historically accurate. Ok since you can actually alter history [so in a way Mother Russia can take over Britan (yay)] i will not actually rate this section.So overall7/10 (for Graphics)7/10 (for Gameplay)10/10 (for community)Rounds out to an average of8/10 (well done Reto-Moto)"
