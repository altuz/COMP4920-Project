HIDDEN SUBSCRIPTION FEE, yes i said it, hidden subscription fee.The subscription is basically something that removes ""this was recorded with (inset recording program here)!"" then expect you to pay $50 on top of it to expect you to be satisfied to have a recording device... Also, it requires Subscription for other things, like streaming and other small detailed items.2.) requiring a seperate log in while having to be connected to steam to even use it...To even has accessible to streaming or any other good features you have to be logged into the account connected to your key and signed into steam...3.) The login for the 2nd time around is longer then usual...4.) unusual lagging while non-recording.It basically uses more resources to NOT record then it is recording... how stupid is that?5.) I can get a Free recorder to do just as much if no better then the recorder here without a subscription fee and less time consumed on having to relog in on everything everytime...I got a refund for this product once i found out all this stuff that i believed to be wrong with it, honestly... I would say don't spend $50 to have a video recorder and then have to pay $8 a month to get good features for a video recorder that should already be there or shouldn't be there after paying $50 to get the thing."

It works flawlessly. and is capable of so much more, to even green screening.I bought this thinking it would be better quality. for some reason it will not stream on anything from twitch toyoutube or hitbox. I went through everything with ""Contact Support"" went through evey step possible,and still not anything to get the streaming working. its pretty buggy too, like it changes its setttings sometimeswithout you even knowing. I still use it for recording and uploading, thats the only thing it seems to work for me.I can't say eveyone will have this problem, But I can't recommend it to anyone either, when OBS is free, they arealways updating it too making it better everytime. with OBS, you can manually set up your recording screen to howyou want it. I think maybe this program is for people who need the setting automated for them, but still I recommendOBS and taking the patience to learn."

Encoding in MP4 and uses almost nothing of your CPU, you can easily record every game you want. Uploading your videos directly on your Youtube channel thru the software as never been so easy. For a 30 minutes Video at 60 FPS recording i only had a  6GB Video File  or less, it all depends of what the game you are recording.With the New Time Shift system you can record only the last action you made without recording the whole sequence by pressing a simple button that saves the last recorded seconds.Pros--------User Friendly Interface-Easy to use-Doesn't use much memory , so your gameplay isn't lagging-Cheap-Easy Upload to your YouTube Channel-Time Shift System is awesome for recording only your best moments/actions-Streaming is free since a few patches, no more monthly subscribing-Recording in MP4 so no more 100GB files any more-720p or 1080p of 4k support-30, 60 or even 120 FPS recording available-Still updated when needed.Cons---------Not a freeware but ok, it deserves to be a payware.-Recording HUD doesn't Support some games in Windowed more-..."

Stuff like not recording everything, audio/video sync and some other ocurrencies I cant even describe properly.For months I have been working on fixing those, but with no success.

,Not Recommended,228180,10143289,"Posted: 16 May, 2014",all,vagenda,"I can not recommend this software for the following reasons:1) It can not broadcast my game.  I have to use full screen, or set up a selection window around the Windowed instance of the game.  The latter doesn't work, as the controls get permanently attached beneath the selection area, rather than staying in the seperated interface the controls began in.  Since my game is the hieght of my screen, it kicks the controls off screen, rendering them inaccessable.  There is no work-around short of short-cut keys.2) There is no preview.  It appears that there will be one, but when streaming, there in fact is none.3) It can not handle overlays with transparencies.  It can only use straight-up square images as they are.  No Chroma.4) It can not handle audio intelligently.  I have Game Sounds, TeamSpeak, Media-Monkey, and a microphone.  Ideally, you could have each on a fader in a mixer with a side-chain compressor dynamically lowering all sounds but TeamSpeak and Mic when they are creating sound above a set threshold.  This can't do anything but select an audio source and/or a mic - period.5) This software actually performed worse than Open Broadcast in my testing.  I run a modest game (DC Universe) on a Core i7 3770, 16GB RAM, Creative Labs X-Fi HD Titanium, AMD HD6890 and I have 18Mb d/l and 11Mb u/p speeds from my ISP.  Open Broadcast reliably, and repeatably, outperformed this software.6) This software sells as though it were a ""buy this and then use it all you want"" title, when in fact it is actually a subscription model.  I find the sales presentation of this title deceptive.  Period.  I had no idea it was subscription based until I had already purchased, downloaded, installed, and run the program for the first time.  Once you run it, the Subscription Model is the very first thing it talks about.  Keyword = DECEPTIVE.Summary:If there was any semblance of a Help->Contact Us within the program, and they could be reached with this feedback and all of the above issues were resolved, it would be worth the money to buy - not to subscribe - to buy.As it is - totally wasted my time and money on this and will have to return to OBS just to broadcast properly - which it did for free in the first place."

(aka, all of my bullet hell titles i enjoy, and many indie games). A paper thin help system doesn't help. I've tried on multible PCs with this item and it either flat out refuses to record or records, records at a insanely laggy space (1 frame per 4 seconds anybody?) or just doesn't do the job it was stated that it was able to do.It is also VASTLY overpriced for such ineffective, poorly featured software. I've payed $20 or less for recording software that's far more effective than this such as bandicam, fraps and a few others (only reason i brought this was because i really needed a recorder that was portable to different PCs, since steam handles the licencing for you then it was ideal).Save your money and wait for another recording software to come out on the steam software section.. trust me.. your just throwing your money away with this product.*PS* If you want more reasons not to buy the software then check out the steam fourms for this product."

Is 50 bucks a little too much for the casual recorder? Yes    If you plan on using it very often, this is well worth the money."
,Recommended,228180,12665745,"Posted: 28 October, 2014",all,RetroGuy3210,"I've had it for a while now, and I can say that while it has it's flaws, it is definitely a solid recorder. It can record games at 1080p if you want (and can). I will mention that there is an original option in the quality options, which is for recording at a resolution that isn't 1080p, 720p, 480p, 360p or 240p. It will not record higher than 1080p though. If you are playing a game at 1080p, and you set it to record at 720p, it will only record at that resolution. This is a fantastic feature because, while it may look a bit blurry (and i mean a TINY bit), it will come out as a much smaller file. Which is good if you don't own a very big hard drive or want to upload something to Youtube in your lifetime. This recording option can be done in any of the listed resolutions. This feature is lacking in several big recording softwares, which force people to manually compress the files.The UI is fantastic, and way more straight forward than most recorders that I have used before. The recording options are easy to reach, and yet they seem to do a lot without being confusing. There are SO many features that I love about this software that I can't find in most recorders. There's a window option, where you can record a certain part of your screen, which is very handy for windowed games. There's a facecam option if you have a camera. And of course, it has the usual voice recording options.You can choose for it to limit your frame rate while you are recording, which is good if you don't want lag or just simply want to record at a certain FPS. Action also performs WAAAAYYY better than FRAPS. The recording quality is definitely grainy, but it's worth it for the better framerate, and while some people may want to go for the recorder that records a tiny bit better, Action won't dive on the frame rate.When I used FRAPS to play a retro game, I got about 5 FPS, and the game even FROZE at times. Even when I wasn't recording, having it open slowed the game down.  With Action, the game ran like it did when I wasn't recording. It was incredible how fast it ran. One complaint I have, is the FPS options I mentioned earlier. You can chose to limit your frame rate at 60, 50, 30, 25, 24 (yes 24), 20, 15, and 120. Why are the options so random? Why is there a 25 and 24 option? There's no difference! And yet there's no 40 FPS option. I actually really like limiting my frame rate at 40. So why am I stuck with using 25, 24 and 15? Get rid of 24, as a single frame difference is NOTHING, and add 40.EDIT: After a long time of use, I have noticed how much of a lottery it is when it comes to audio. Sometimes the recording has tinny, echoing sound, which really sticks out like a nose unless if you mask it with music in editing. Other times, however, it records perfectly fine.IMPORTANT: To do live streams, you need a subscription. It comes with a free subscription when you buy it, but I can't remember how long it is. I have never streamed using Action, so don't ask me how it performs. I really want to emphasise that there are programs like OBS (Open Broadcaster Software) that can not only record games, but also stream them FOR FREE. Not to mention you can also add on screen pictures and messages in real time on OBS. So if you want to do live streams, seriously consider something else.If you want to see it in action (joke intended), check out my Youtube channel athttps://www.youtube.com/user/MrNiceguy3210My videos are mediocre, but I have a lot of fun making them :)."

Really, it's that smooth! As a veteran from the days when Gamecam and Fraps were about the only recording software you could find I'm glad I can finally put those devices in the garbage where they belong. Gamecam was really below average and Fraps was nothing but a CPU hog. Even with a good rig Fraps would cause either slight lag or an annoying stutter that would often interrupt gameplay. Action! does everything I want; offers plenty of options without being complex; and puts out beautiful high quality video without lagging my game. Now I recommend this program to all of my friends and tell them to ditch Fraps."

It seems that your Steam Account doesn't exist in the community...and the major issue is that IT tells you on your profile that you've run this program for # of hours and the last time you run it.I've contacted the support to get a Non-Steam version copy of this product but I've got thisresponse:#Discussions_QuoteBlock_AuthorHello,I am afraid you can not use Steam app outside Steam.You can buy non-steam version in our store here:https://mirillis.com/en/store/onlinestore.htmland try to get a refund from Steam.Best RegardsMirillis Team- I'm being told to BUY a copy outside Steam- Try to refund it from SteamYeah sure.. since this product can't disable the STEAM API like other softwares out there outside of Steam, I want to get a non-steam version copy instead.Instead, I'm asked to buy another copy which is a little expensive which is the non commercial version outside Steam.Alright, I'll try to refund my 60+ hrs on record of this software..

Once it reaches 2.### you'll no longer get updates.Although you can still use it but you won't get the new features until you buy the next version.(Similar to Vegas Pro #) you buy it per versions.Take note that buying this product outside of Steam cost more than the Steam version but it should fix your privacy problems.Over all, this program is definitely great for budgeted YouTubers and Gamers.

Very recently, Action! seems to be a smooth sailing experience. Hence, the recommendation. My PC set-up is Win 10 16GB of memory and a CPU that is i7-6700 @ 3.4GHz. My video card is AMD R9 200 Series 4GB GDDR5. I run my games in both SSD and HDD. I record with my webcam overlaying the game and desktop. Typic setting is 1920x1080 24fps.Some points to note / tips for sharing.[1] Their support team is very responsive. These days, they are able to fix issues within a day or so. I've had positve experience with their support team.[2] After changing the setting, it is good to close the app and reopen again before recording. I find it more stable that way.[3] There may still be instances that Action! may not work. Such as, recording my mic via Zoom R24 audio mixer whereby Windows 10's voice recorder is able to do the job.[4] It would be good if Action! allows us to set up profile for different recording setting. It is manual right now. Switching between different games, I find myself having to change quite a lot of settings in a day.If you are interested to see the results, they are in my YouTube channel.https://www.youtube.com/c/wilfridwong"

(Not sure why, possibly it came down to my PC specs? but in all honesty my computer is near high-end, so it bugged me.Then i came accross Action!, and i never knew steam had recording software for sale, so i was intrigued about this.. I wen't on to read reviews and watched some video's about it, and nearly everyone was giving it positive vibes. Sooo.. i thought, let's give this one a try, and let's fork out some money and actually pay a little extra and hope for something good. So i sold some items and bought it.I will say, this is the best money i have spent on anything related to recording and creating videos.. Honestly i am blown away at the quality it produces & allows me to record in, and it doesn't play heavy on my PC, i don't lose frames and my video's turn out just like i would be playing the game. I can actually record in 1080/60fps! It's just amazing.Livestreaming is also now possible on here, it let's you stream to YouTube, Twitch, HitBox, etc..

It does not lag your game as many other tools out there in the market. It allows you to record in two channels your video and your voice and integrate them seemleasly in your final video. The only downsize of it is the file size of each output. Sometimes I need Movie Maker to convert the video to something more manageable. Its youtube integration is not the best but it works fine if your youtube account is premium, in order to upload the larger files. So far, I have not hit any pay walls, or restrictions. So far the tool has been great. I have recorded gameplay from different games ranging from: Diablo III, Starcraft, Fallout, Elder Scrolls to Star Wars the old republic. In other words, I have been able to record gameplay for MMOs and standalone games without experiencing hiccups in the process. I find it very easy to use, and though it is not the greatest tool ever, I believe that it is very versatile, gets the job done and does not interfere with your gaming... and in my book that makes it one of the best tool...

After i discovered this program i regret that i dont used it earlier :DBoys and Girls.. If you want to:> Stream> Record gameplay in background and just save the best scenes all the time> Record desktop (for tutorials etc)> Record browser videos (which blocked for other programms like youtube)> Record internet radio or any other audio> Record webcam or micro> Record just a part of the screen(s) or just one window> Screenshots from desktop or ingame (much more easier then with other ones)Some features dont sound like a big benefit, but there still a lot of locks at youtube or other pages which dont allow you (and yea spec programms cant help you without realtime record) to download or record stuff. There is also a big benefit if you make a lot of high quality videos with programms like Adobe Primiere Pro.. sometimes you have problems to import stuff.. easy now.. just a litle high quality record with Action. Before i decided to test this programm i freaked out everytime i got problems by saving or import stuff for cut.+ dont take many ressources+ best quality i ever seen+ individual settings+ seperate audio tracks+ ALL features (u can imagine)- smaler and other skins for HUD would be nice(-) you have to start up the software manually (there is no auto start with windows).

Never a good idea, espically when it's $50, but it gave me a pleasant surprise.As a sidenote, before this, I used FRAPS to record most of everything I did, which tanks my framerate for one reason or annother, and always seems to output massive files.It has a very clean and easy to use UI, and it's actually quite attractive.  It was incredibly easy to use straight out of the box, which is important to me because I really hate messing around with programs for months until I finally figure them out fully.  Even rebinding controls is fairly extensive while remaining simple to use.It outputs in either AVI or MP4, and can record in 1080p without losing many frames at all, which is amazing, but it still has the filesize issue which could just be considered an issue with recording anything in HD.  It also has a framerate counter in the corner.Now for what I didn't find so good...I'm not a streamer and have no interest in doing so, but they lure you in with the promise of a streaming software and then only give you 14 days until you have to pay a monthly subscription, something that makes little to no sense beyond greed considering many cheaper programs do it for free.  That's a no-no.You cannot use active desktop or specified area recording without having Windows Aero theme enabled.  This was incredibly frustrating for me because I hate the Aero theme and yet it still gives the recording UI making you think you're doing something when you're not even outputting a file.  I spent quite a while re-shooting a single 2 minute section until I finally closed it down, changed my Windows theme, and started up and it *finally* worked.  This NEEDS to be fixed, either disable the ""ghost"" UI or allow us to record without Aero on, I don't care which, I just know it needs fixing.All in all I'll give it a 7/10, it would be an 8, but there's also a fake review I recall seeing on here (you can tell since it's written like a disclaimer,) so there's annother point gone.  I'll fully reccomend it if they fix the issue I mentioned."

Not having used any other recording program I can only comment on this one as a novice I guess, but that is why I can give a positive review through the eyes of a newcomer to the process.As far as I am concerned it is great, once you have decided on the right settings that suit you everything just falls into place and the results are very good. Not only that but you can take screenshots and desktop vids as well with this software which is handy if you wanted to make a recording of something you are working on at the time on your computer. The file can be uploaded or shared privately if you wish to a 3rd party via email YT or FB and I am sure others as well and of course attached to your Steam Profile page.There are many explanitory files available on YT referring specifically to this program and you just need to try some to see which suits you and your system for the best results. I purchased my copy on Steam and you can purchase it online as well depending on your preference.Only small cons are the fact you cannot edit and occasionally after uploading to YT, you need to re-boot to close the program. It will not lock up your system, so normal functionality doesn't seem to be effected just the Action program itself which is a minor inconvenience.Do I recommend, yes I do and with the extra keys I have on the left hand end of my keyboard, operation is a breeze. Even using your standard function keys, operation is simple. I would rate this program 9.5/10."

I got a few desktop recordings to test out different approaches to fix the issues I've been plagued with but now I simply can't get it to record.This is looking more and more like a software still very much in development and by no means a product for which you should pay your hard earned cash.  There are other more stable software that don't just flip the switch on you, although a bit more complex and resource hogs, at least they work.I have this in my library and I'll keep it there until Mirillis lot figure out how to make this work consistently, because it would be a crying shame for such an approachable and brilliant (when working) software to go to waste.Put it on your wishlist, wait for the developers to fix it and then and only then give it a chance."

Small in size, Action! records video and audio quite well. The FPS counter in the corner makes it easy to tell how taxing the recording is, and can be toggled on/off or positioned where it won't block your view. It does allow for uploading directly to Youtube, and livestreaming if you have the premium version.The only downside is that some of the buttons to start/stop recording (F10, F9, etc) can't be changed. This can lead to some problems in certain games where those buttons have use already. Besides that, it's great overall."

Action has its own .AVI codec, FICV, so don't plan on raw uploading to YouTube if you don't record in MP4 format. Supports game, active window, and region-based recording. Can record videos at the same framerate as the video, which is kind of gimmicky in my own opinion. Also supports time limited recording, meaning you can set it stop recording after X amount of minutes, hours, etc. Has built in streaming support with a free 14-day trial, after that, you have to pay $7.95 a month, which is actually quite cheap. Also supports audio recording, and FPS benchmarking. It can make use of AMD APP hardware acceleration. Supports webcam overlay in a screen recording.Overall, this software offers a lot, and I could easily recommend it to anyone. Records some of the smoothest and high-quality videos I've seen - especially for their size when compared to the likes of Fraps. Honestly though, I use PlayClaw for my goto recorder, simply for the MJPEG .AVI codec, as I prefer to do raw uploads to YouTube as I don't do any video editing."

However, once you switch it to record active screen, it works amazingly! I was wrong about this program. Its a minor misunderstanding, so try to get this program for yourselves. With the ability to record video and audio separately or together, live streaming, taking screenshots, or recording your webcam, there's no limit to what you can do. I'd recommend using these settings when recording a video:-720p or 1080p-60fps-record active screen-mic on ""always record"" (if you want)-use the ""avi"" file formatThanks for reading, and I hope this review was helpful.

Minimal configuration needed.Cons: Video is downscaled from 1600x1200 to 1080p.

The only problem is probably the streaming portion as it seems a bit steep to pay the $50 dollars for the software and then a subscription plan to stream on twitch as opposed to OBS which is completely free software, and XSplit, which only requires a subscription plan.

,Recommended,228180,12147441,"Posted: 19 September, 2014",all,Kickz,"This review is in the context of making Let's Play / Gameplay videos for YouTube.I have no experience or interest in using it for any other purpose, except streaming in the future.Keep that in mind if you are reading this review but care about other features of the application!I did include a section on my experience with Streaming but know that I lack a lot of technical knowledge in that department :)So, let's keep moving  then :)I'm a heavy Fraps user and spend countless hours watching Sony Movie Studio render my videos from hundreds of GB to 3-4GB.I was skeptical at first, thinking how could anything record in compressed MP4 and not impact gaming performance.Skeptical most likely due to my lack of technical knowledge when it comes to media recording :)However, after downloading the DEMO from their website I quickly realized that for my personal needs,Action! is the dog's bollox!Needless to say I did no hesitate to immediately purchase the streaming edition of this application.--------------------------------------------------Gameplay video quality--------------------------------------------------Not only does it compress intoready-to-upload MP4, YouTube compatible format, it also records inperfect 1080p, high quality withhigh bitrateandgreat soundin expected FPS withno impact on performance.Keep in mind, just like when using FRAPS or similar you have to be recording on to a separate dedicated drive or the read/write to/from the HD while playing the game interfere with the read/write instructions of the recording application.My setup, OS installed on HD1, STEAM games run on HD2 and Recording Software records to HD3.P.s: Don't take my sounds quality from my videos on my profile as a good example as I still use a crappy old headset and I'm awaiting my standalone mic delivery :)--------------------------------------------------Streaming (noob point of view)--------------------------------------------------Streaming is something I'm planning on doing in the future but the small test already shown me the improved stability over Raptr Twitch streaming and OBS.Mind you, I have limited experience using other streaming software but with my limited knowledge I found Action! ready to use out of the box with no extra config needed to get a 1080p quality stable Stream up, while with the others I found myself tinkering to much and giving up.YES, that could be unique to my situation as I'm a noob when it comes to streaming :)--------------------------------------------------Edit - 04-October-2014--------------------------------------------------Throughout the below update I will not mention AVI as it had the exact same issues as MP4 with AMD APP and also, if I have to record in AVI with large file sizes I might as well stick with FRAPS!!After now using the application for 2 weeks on a daily base and over 150hours I have come across a of new information.I found the application working amazingly great with 7 Days to Die and that is what my original review was based on.The only issue I had was that recording just stopped during the loading sequence when loading a new or saved game. So I simply started recording after I loaded the map and had no issues.I was recording using MP4 with AMD APP on 1080p, recording microphone and game sound in separate channels for editing later.For this, Mirillis Action!, was amazing.Then Middle-Earth came out and I'm now, since it's release trying to record the gameplay but have one issue after the next.Basically the game is loading one sequence after the next, switching from scenes to action combat all the time.That cause my recording to crash over and over and over as that was the issue I had with the initial loading screen in 7 Days to Die too but unlike Shadow or Mordor, 7DTD does not have any more loading screens during the game so I never realised the bigger picture of the problem.So, what have I tried?With MP4 without AMD APP on 720pI choose to only record in MP4 and not AVI or MP4 with AMD APP it doesn't crash during the loading screens then but I can only record in 720p but hey,..better than crashing..This looked great at first as now the recording didn't crash.....However, the recording quality then was just awful, the sound goes all over the shop. The sound peaks go up and down randomly and random crackling in the sound channel is to hear while recording as well as on replay. Speed changes of the sound track and you end up with a clip where the video channel is longer than the sound channels due to the speed changes. All the awesome voice acting changes into Alvin and the Chipmunks!The FPS is also awful, the image stutters and FPS jumps around like a dog in heat., even though it is only recording then at 720p.Now, what next....?I switch back to MP4 with AMD APP and 1080p and worked out that when I un-check ""use multicore recording"" that it also doesn't crash any more during loading sequences.Awesome. 1080p no crash and back to normal....NO now I also get the same problem with the sound, which changes speed and the quality is pure rubbish.With MP4 with AMD APP on 1080p and multicore uncheckedWhen I record in MP4 with AMD APP on 1080pwith ""use multicore recording"" checkedthe quality of the sound is brilliant and the video quality is too but then I get the issue that the application stops recording when ever any type of loading sequence occurs.SummarySo, to that end it seems that I either record with perfect sound and image quality and all the bells and whistle work amazingly wellbuthave to manually re-start recording between loading screens which is a pain in the a$$, specially if you have a dynamic game like Shadow of Mordor I can record in rubbish quality with loads of sound issues but don't crash.When I went back to my old way, recording with fraps for video and audacity for sound I might have huge file sizes but at least everything is perfect and nothing crashes.--------------------------------------------------Edit - 06-February-2015--------------------------------------------------Since my last edit I have come across several other users who have no issues using Action! but noticed their PCs much more powerful.It seems the more powerful your PC is the less of the issues I described above you will see, which would lead me to believe that the application is not very well optimized for mid-range PCs even if FPS is consistently above 30FPS during recording.I have since switched to DXTory which for me personally on a mid-range PC worked out a lot better.I can do the same as with Action!, splitting sound channels, etc.. + much more. I can have numerous sound inputs all being recorded in separate channels which is great for virtual audio channels running TS3 or similar through it.I still would recommend the application to anyone with a good PC as it is an application with a low learning curve and easy to get into if you are new to recording your gameplay."

The quality of the videos are great the sound recorded sounds amazing. I have had the program since it came out roughly and the one thing i never actually recored was the Microphone or Cam sections. That was my own choice not because of any type of flaw that i had or anything like that.It does take a few minutes to go through the various settings and what not. Once you fully configure it to your desired settings i would say it takes a few uses to become fully comfortable with it.Uploading directly to Youtube is not a great option, yes it does work, however its shotty at times. I have never had any issues tho exporting into other formats, any other format works flawlessly. Just slight issues with exporting direct to Youtube, idk if thats due to cookies or anything of that nature.I would recommend this to people who have good computers and/or laptops. Seriously if your not pushing a decent i7 or comperable AMD you won't enjoy this product or any game recording products for that matter. Remember alot of the strain for this time of work is going to depend on having a very good processor and ofcourse a pretty good graphics card also have atleast 16gb ram. The software doesn't claim to require these things nor does it. However between this software and whatever ""high end"" game you are recording you will need the extra power."

76561198134812038,Recommended,228180,19098578,"Posted: 15 November, 2015",all,St.Elmo'sFire,"Mrillis Action!, is a screen recorder that gives you high quality videos and a stylish, easy to use interface. The layout is simple and easy to use, while still having everything you would want in a screen recorder. It has 3 modes: ""Gaming mode"", which, as the title would suggest, is best for recording gaming videos. ""Active Screen"" or ""Windowed mode"" which records your entire desktop screen, unlike Gaming Mode which only records the game window. And then ""Active Desktop Region."" This mode is mainly used if you want to target and record a specific area on your screen.This screen recorder also has built in audio recording and snapshotting abilities, which can come in handy.This screen recorder isn't perfect, so let's get into some of its cons.1. Sometimes while trying to record a specific game, (Minecraft for instance) the big red ""record"" button is greyed out and you are unable to click on it. So you are forced to just use the hotkey ""F9"" to start and stop the recording. However, this can become tedious, at least for me. I for one have had a few experiences where I accidently pressed the wrong button and I didn't record. And although a lot of people don't think being forced to use the hotkey is a bad thing, I personally wish I could press the button instead for certain situations. I'm not sure if this is for all games or not, but this has happened for quite a few games before.2. Sometimes the start and stop recording hotkey is unresponsive. Often when you start a recording then stop it, then start it again, it won't start the second time and you are left talking to yourself in your house and you gained no recording. Its really a let down when you have been recording for an hour and then you look back and it hasn't been recording at all. This is another reason I wish I could just press the red button to start the recordings and that it wasn't all greyed out for some reason.3. If your game crashes while you are recording, that video file becomes corrupted and you cannot view it. This really blows and is one of the main reasons I stopped using bandicam and switched to Action, because bandicam did the same thing. However, it appears Action has the same problem. I really wish when the game crashed the recording would continue on, but be a black screen instead, or perhaps would just stop the recording. But instead if your game crashes you lose that recording, which is very dissapointing.4. The price. I know this isn't exactly a strong con, but I should mention that this recorder costs $49.99. Not a terrible price to pay for a screen recorder, but still pretty expensive. I'd recommend waiting until there's a sale and pick it up for maybe $40 or $35.And that's all I can really think of for cons at the moment.So:Cons:1. Can't click the starting and stopping button on some games.2. Start and stop recording hotkey is sometimes unresponsive.3. If your game crashes while you are recording, you lose that recording.4. Its a bit pricey.Pros:1. Stylish Interface that is easy to use while still providing all the necessary settings you would need for a screen recorder.2. High quality videos.3. Multiple recording options4. Audio and snapshotting abilities.5. Stable.Overall I would definitely recommend this software, especially if you are a youtuber like myself. Its easy to use and really doesn't dissapoint too much. It has its problems, but personally I feel the pros outweigh the cons.Its a very handy application that you should get even if you are not a youtuber. However, i'd advise picking it up during a sale.Thanks for reading! :)-Ultra Froggy"

Also it would great to see Developers open their rendering codec to public, Action! rendering currently supports AVI-only render but uploads still can be done via MP4 extension. What I meant is:When you record your MP4 Hardware GPU supported video, and when you put your recorded file into the folder, You cannot re-render your MP4 video via Action!. Thats because specific Action!-only rendering engine/codec is closed-source and supports only AVI extension videos. If you record as AVI, you can do it.Action! is great program for mainly local recordings. You can also stream to youtube (various services) however there'sno ""BRB"" screen while you ALT-TAB to your desktop, so your viewers can see your desktop, watch out thatworth to buy in my opinion, devs still releasing updates"
