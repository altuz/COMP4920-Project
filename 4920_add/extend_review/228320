,Not Recommended,228320,14952852,"Posted: 18 March, 2015",all,The Centipede,"Hoo boy.The originalA Valley Without Windstruck me as about the quality of a particularly impressive bit of shareware in the late 90s: horribly dated by modern standards and without 1980s retro charm (though maybe that just means it came a decade early), but at the very least technically competent. Animations were smooth (though obviously based on some simple figure rendering program like Poser), the control scheme worked, the story didn't make much sense but a lot of 90s shareware didn't so I could at least poke around with it and be vaguely amused.You will note that I only have 19 minutes on record withA Valley Without Wind 2.I'm going to hold off on explaining why for just a moment. This sequel--if it can really be called that, since the wholeAVWW""broken reality"" thing never made much narrative sense to begin with, and apparently intentionally so--has you running a rebellion against a big bad. Unlike the originalAVWW, where you had followers who you would make go away for so many minutes to go gather firewood or whatever while you ran around the infinitely side-scrolling (well, infinitely transitioning, at least) map, this actually has a strategic map for you to tell your followers to go to places and do things and fight baddies. It's a nice touch, adding some level of strategic force movement rather than simply ""Bob has a 57% chance of getting a carrot with a 99% risk of dying because Bob is a loser.""Well, I lie. It would've been a nice touch. If it worked.If anything worked.IfAVWWhas the quality of decent 90s shareware,AVWW2has the quality ofbad90s shareware, the kind that I have spent a good decade and a half trying to forget that I grew up on. The characters have gone from smoothly-animated pre-rendered 3D geometry sprites to poorly MS Paint'd cartoons that move as though they're suffing grand mal seizures. InAVWW, everything was made of pre-rendered sprites so it all fit together visually. Random elements inAVWW2are pre-rendered, some are drawn, others are painted, and they're all mashed together in incoherent tilesets so it's actually extremely distracting. The control system went from a simple but effective ""keyboard to move, mouse to aim"" system inAVWWto a clunky and incoherent keyboard-only system. For a comparative example, let's say you want to shoot your magical ball-o'-death at some critter at an angle:AVWW, point and click.AVWW2, hold the right and up and fire keys at the same time and pray to whatever gods you have that you timed that perfect 45° angle shot just right because 45° angles are all you're going to be doing and also if you don't do the fire button at the right time then you're just going to jerkily leap your character up and into the target in a valiant but utterly stupid attempt to smash the enemy with her face. That's howArchonworked back in the late 80s. It's as though theAVWW2was coded for a particularly archaic D-pad setup. Everything about it is completely retrograde from the original.It's completely unforgivable, since these people were able to make something competent, if not particularly impressive before. However, it's also unimaginably hilarious. It is so bad you just have to stop and laugh at everything.And then just stop, since there's absolutely no point to go on any further with it.There's certainly no point in actually spending money on the experience."
,Not Recommended,228320,10013535,"Posted: 3 May, 2014",all,I love the lag,"There's some interesting ideas here, and it's a multiplayer game in the strictest sense of the word, but at the end of the day when you cross genres you want to blend them rather than keep them in their own awkward boxes.  This game has an art style that will be off-putting to many, but I found it charming in an odd way.  The different powers are interesting, but could be a little more imaginative and balance between them is basically non-existant.  For the most part, the powers don't make good use of the movement- and neither do the randomly generated maps that generally end up being narrow tunnels to fall down and strange ceilings.  The boss fights are slightly better by being a little more open, but overall it's very static and repetitive.The game has a metric ton of good ideas, but the implementation and integration is so poor that everything steps on each other's toes.  In addition the game uses strange terminology and despite explaning itself is still pretty difficult to puzzle out.  Figuring it out is kind of fun, but once you unlock the puzzle you realize that it's a lot simpler than it lets on in a bad way and it's more about getting lucky early on with a co-operative starting area than anything else.  Speaking of Co-op, it is barely functional and requires a great deal of patience.  Still, it's nice to have the option to be able to suffer together.To it's credit, I can't say I didn't have any fun, but bad platforming, dissonant storyline, confusing mechanics and characters and luck-based play (a decent beginning can trivialize the hardest difficulty but a bad one makes all but the easiest one impossible) as well as terrible implementation of platforming means I'm not going to be missing it."

If you like metroidvania type games you should definitely check it out especially when it's only 2.99 right now on sale.  What makes it so unique compared to other games of the kind is that every level is a tile on the turn based strategy game portion, and what level you will want to do is going to be decided by what you need to be happening strategically.What makes the game such a fun challenge is that each tile has a difficulty percentage that can vary widely depending on different factors including what is happening in the strategy portion.  So, you might really need to open up a section of a map that's blocked by a tile with %500 difficulty level, but have fun with those crazy fast enemies and projectiles that knock off a third of your health, but hey, you gotta do what you gotta do.  Or, what if you can't make it through?  Time to rethink your strategy,  work on earning enough coins to hire mercenaries to open it up for you, tweak your character to go for speed over health, or or whatever else you can think of.  The world has it's own rules and mysteries and a lot of the fun is these things slowly becoming apparent to you as you play.What I love about the game is all the variety in the side scrolling action and it's effect in making your strategy come together to win the game.  I think personally this game is tied with Red Faction Guerilla for most underrated, but this probably even more for all the hate it gets from people that can't look past its subpar graphics to see the amazing gameplay and feeling of being in a coherent world with its own inherent logic all coming together in a challenging and satisfying experience.  Just like other Arcen games there are lots of difficulty settings, I suggest you crank it up a bit."

It's not that the individual elements have never been used before, it's that they've never been combined in quite this way.  This game makes no attempt at anything vaguely resembling physics, so if you're a stickler for that stuff skip this game.  But the gameplay is challenging and absolutely consistent, and the dream-like demon-apocalypse setting combined with the odd but memorable soundtrack, makes for a lot of fun for people looking for something different."

It's ugly, the platforming is clunky, the procedural generation leads to cases where you can get stuck in unpredictable places, the strategy layer is impossible to parse, and the combat is really tedious."
,Recommended,228320,2248224,"Posted: 22 February, 2013",all,ACWraith,"Question the graphical choices all you want.  This game is the ActRaiser successor I never realized I wanted until I played.  It's a strategy board game tightly integrated with run and gun action.  The regular threats to my units and structures provided by Demonaica and summoned monsters along the way kept me alert.  You need those units and those units need at least some of those structures.  While I won on the default settings, know that this is a game that allows you to lose after hours and hours of investment.The duration might be the only real gripe I have.  I could be biased by my analysis paralysis and the time it took to learn my first game.  However, the promise of another procedurally generated map to conquer loses some of its charm for me when it takes double digit hours to finish.  I realize that's probably not uncommon for the strategy genre, but I have to too many games in my Steam library to bother.As a bonus, the game also comes with the prequel.  Some may enjoy the more freeform exploration, but the branching pathways contain a lot of empty, useless space.  It's big for the sake of being big.  I much prefer the sequel's selection of more linear playfields.  The prequel also allows players to gather much more loot and micromanage their inventory.  Though I may whine when my equipment breaks, I much prefer the sequel's limit of a single, temporary piece of loot that disappears when replaced.  With the collection of perks, feats and mage classes tied so closely to one's progress, there's enough to gather and worry about as it is.  In short, the sequel cuts out a lot of the cruft and is a better game for it.Finally, forum complaints can largely be ignored.  Mouse control has been added.  It allegedly makes the game too easy at the moment so I'd suggest gamepad or keyboard controls for now.  Either way, it shows that Arcen listens.  I'd personally also like to see more animation detail and a final sendoff when the game ends.  However, it's worth playing as it is."

There's platforming and a strategic map section, and while the platforming is okay, the strategic map has you under constant pressure to deal with threats and keep a bunch of numbers up and it's not always clear what's going on. For someone who likes quick, engaging platformers, the strategy elemtn will probably just be stressful and overwhelming, as it was for me. If you like strategy games, you'll probably think the platforming is unpleasant. The eight way aiming makes it hard to feel like you have a satisfying level of control over your character and leads to combat that is more frustrating than it is pleasantly challenging."

As a side goal, there was a settlement you could build up and add things to.This game disables mouse aiming by default, restricts the evasion and projectile variety greatly, and send the construction/City Sim aspect into a larger role.Graphically, it looks somewhat better, but there's so much different.

The platforming and weapon/equipment systems from the first game have been streamlined and polished up, but the overworld has been transformed into a sort of turn-based strategy game. The mix between these two modes keeps it moving along throughout each ""world"". It's a little hard to fully grasp all the concepts at first, but once you get a feel for it, it all falls into place. There was a lot of initial forum hate upon release, which was pretty unfounded IMO, but quickly addressed by the awesome developers, understandably begrudgingly."
,Recommended,228320,2432126,"Posted: 17 April, 2013",all,Mauno,"A post-apocalyptic steampunk fantasy sci-fi turn-based strategy RPG platformer. With landsharks.Weird mash-up of different genres. Plays really well, both in the world map's strategy mode and in the platformer mode you go into when exploring tiles of the map. The art style and graphics are... interesting, but very low quality.The objective of the game is simply to survive in the Valley, until you're strong enough to beat the evil boss, Demonaica. Survival is pretty damn hard at times, as Demonaica's stronghold regularly spawns nasty creatures to try and kill your survivor buddies.On the world map, you get to move around survivors you've rescued, construct buildings that increase resource generation on specific tiles, heal nearby survivors, etc. The interesting bit is that because the game spawns monsters regularly, you need to keep your survivors mobile, while still balancing the resource generation with losses taken in battle.The platformer sections remind me of Terraria's combat system: you run and jump around in randomly generated levels while monsters try to eat your face. Every class has 4 spells, usually one long-range spell, two short-range spell and a unique, extremely powerful special spell.The objective in the platformer sections is to find wind generators and destroy them, allowing your survivors to move to the tiles you've 'purified'. Certain tiles also have perk tokens and other things for customizing your character, usually found in dangerous caves.There's some weird time travel stuff going on in the platformer sections, as different tiles represent different time periods: you can explore the ruins of a modern city, with skyscrapers and stuff, and next turn find yourself in a steampunk city, or perhaps the ruins of an ancient, Egyptian style civilization. The level art is quite diverse, but as I said, the assets are pretty damn low quality.Fun game, and very much worth the low price if you'd like to try a platformer with a strategy game element. AVWW2 does both damn well.Demo available here:http://www.arcengames.com/w/index.php/valley2-downloadsAllows you to play 'till turn 20, or level 3, but other than that, has all the features of the full game."

Unlike the first part this game is more focused and a match plays faster. You don't have to delve in randomized dungeons for hours to get achievements or unlockables although there might be persons who did just that. Also the graphical style is similar but not that awful, improved you might say. I was worried reading about the setting and how that might translate into gameplay but it's working nicely. You play on a strategic board against an immortal enemy and his minions. Your units run around turnbased and grab ressources or build tile improvements while the enemy hunts them down. Parallely you dispatch your PC into worthwhile areas to play jump and shoot.If you liked AVWW1 or enjoy jump'n'shoots along with light strategy give this game a try - if you hated AVWW1 then you don't like this one either I guess."

This time a little over a single hour was enough time for me.This game is a platformer / strategy hybrid, which kind of reminds me of an old SNES game called ""Act Raiser"". Much like in Act Raiser, in ""A Valley Without Wind 2"" you split your game time between the strategic ""map view"" interface, where you have to think, plan and prioritize, and the platforming/action based ""area purification"" phase.The game offers a variety of characters to choose from. I still haven't wrapped my head around the mechanics and differences between those characters, their classes or whatever it's based on, but it does look promising when considering replayability value, as it looks like it could be interesting to try the game again using a different type of character.I'll update and post comments as I accumulate more game time, as long as I learn anything worth adding, but so far, the game does look like it's going to drain quite a lot of my spare time. :D"

It's not perfect, but it's *fun* and even exploring the game world and it's mechanics.For the sequel, it seems the devs wanted to change everything for the sake of change and experimentation.  And it is decidedly much less enjoyable.  Perhaps if I hadn't played the original at all, but no... this game is too much of a mess.It appears to want to be a more straight up platformer and has a control scheme to match, encouraging you to use a gamepad over KB and mouse as in the original.  In doing so, I can't help but feel that most of the gameplay and mechanics that made the original fun have been removed or extremely stripped down.For example, via spells and enchants, there was a significant amount of character customization you could do in the original.  Granted, I've had only a brief look, but being able to use only one item at a time in the sequel really limits things.I'm guessing here, but I think that the devs, or perhaps too many players, found the original *too* complex and daunting and that explains the more limited gameplay.  Personally, I much prefer the complexity.  Yes, even the unusual ""graph"" based dungeon map that they needed to take a couple of help pages to explain.  It worked, and it was a good idea on their part.So, skip this game unless you find it on a really steep sale price.  The original is worth your time regardless of sale price.

They hired an art studio which makes the game look better, until one of the animations is triggered; then it makes you wish to cry and pluck your eyes out. There are not enough frames to the misaligned animations, especially in comparison to A Valley Without Wind I, which I highly recommend. In addition, they destroyed the combat system by making your magic become the choice of which colour kills your enemy, and also by implementing this silly caliber system. Next is the fact that you come back to life in your archenemy's palace, yet he doesn't really do much to stop you.Hmm... what else is horrible about this game? That damn font. Don't need to say anything else on it. The loot system is also weird, because as soon as you find an item you actually want to use... it breaks. Then you get an achievement for every single tiny thing you do, which is just EXTREMELY annoying. You enter a certain kind of zone for the first time and you get an achievement! Then for each bloody type of equipment you pick up you get an achievement. It is like Arcen are trying to get the players to keep playing by making them feel like they are achieving something through their boredom and eye-plucking. Speaking of eye-plucking, you have to use the standard OS cursor, which just looks really annoying if you try playing with a mouse. That, combined with the fact that its predecessor had a perfectly fine mouse cursor that they could have just pasted right into this game, annoys me.I would highly recommend the intro song though. It is a good intro song.Buy this game, because you unfortunately have to to get its predecessor, which has a better combat system, better graphics, more to do, a better world exploration system and a lot more variance."

The new art is, surprisingly, less attractive than the original and many monsters seem to have been glued in from different artists, with different styles, and the various types of 'classes' are really a matter of what type of colors you'd like to hit enemies with.The overworld aspect is interesting and would've been better with more depth but as is its very shallow and the game's instructions even treat the two halves like separate games prompting one to ask: why aren't they? Both ends have been drastically over simplified and there isn't any real feel of progression or transference from one half to the other. Getting better at the combat doesn't influence the overworld and vice versa.

The combat is vastly more tactical than in the original as well. Simply bursting head first into the landscape on Storm Dash will only result in certain and immediate death.The overworld strategy layer and side-scrolling action integrate well with each other and manipulating one vs the other (to an extend) is a lot of fun.If you like tactical side-scrolling action integrated with a basic but unique strategy layer guiding where to engage next, this game is for you!Recommended."

The most aggrevating of these failures is the pandering to gamepad and console players.  The mouse aim has been removed from the game because it gave mice users an unfair advantage.  In a single player game.  Seriously, if it isn't AI Wars, stay away from everything else this company creates."

The controls for aiming are the worst i have ever used. Gamepad needed to even play because the keyboard controls are so bad, mouse aiming is a lie.  The movement controls are decent but make no attempt at simulating physics you are magically floaty. The enemy A.I. is predictable and easily exploited.The spells are varied and so are the monsters.  The game throws acheivements at you like crazy, some of them you have no idea what you did to earn them.  Not a deep plot, kind of repetative.For all my complaints i still got my moneys worth out of the game and would have to recommend it if you ran out of other sidescrollers to play and can stand bad controls (you get used to them)"

It's fun but fairly light. The meat of the game is a platformer with odd controls that really take some getting used to. About the best thing I can say about that is that it's okay... On the plus side, it's by Arcen games and I'm always happy to support tham. It's also cheap-as-chips, but overall, I think you'll probably want to be spending your valuable playing time elsewhere (like with Arcen's excellent AI War)"

If the concept of playing god while you cleanse a world of villains and rebuild a society, while guiding troops you rescue/protect across this hellscape, and you play in somewhat-shoddy 2D action-platforming between these segments... give it a try? It gets reeeeeeal cheap sometimes."

The controlls are just so bad now that you mostly struggle with them when fighting, instead of struggeling with the enemys.

Although, parallax background effect is disastrous, background moving so much. Gameplay is... eh.Now, spells are categorized, you have to choose one of those groups with four spells. There are no items anymore. So hotkeys decreased to four. And if you find a suit from chests, you have to wear and dispose other automatically. How silly! If you don't like the buffs and debuffs of your new equipment, you can't change it until you find a new bad one :) (because they are all bad).Strategic side of the game is also not so good.So avoid A Valley Without Wind 2 as well. Do not spend your money, save them for another good game."
