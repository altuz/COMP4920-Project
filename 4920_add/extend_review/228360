Instantly one of LucasArts' best titles, now made even better with DoubleFine's updated graphics. Rest in Peace, Roy Conrad, you saved the world of motorcycling for all the Polecats and Vultures out there."

It told the story it was meant to tell and that story was epic."

Since playing the monkey island games and having experienced them in 4 or 16 colours.  I think this game is no where near as good as the remastered monkey island games as the graphics are so much improved on them.This is more like the Day of the tenactle with the drawing being rescanned and everything looking sharper.I had no problems running DOTT and Monkey Island, this game I had the game crashing on the road scenes, but I did managed to complete the game and as a last restort I almost had to look for the original CD-rom.I really wanted to play the original SAM and Max hit the road remastered before this.So after 20 years, I still enjoyed playing this game, but it is amazing how much I recall from having played the game a long long time ago.  I do think the game lacks the depth of Monkey Island and Day of the Tentacle.  I think this was the first lucasarts graphic adventure to use some 3d renduring.my only grumble with this game Is that it is a bit unstable and I had a bit of trouble getting it running, but remembering that I managed to get the original working on a 486 DX4 100 with 8 Mb of ram"

Beautiful artwork and great story telling. A lot of voice acting legends in one game.Although I have to say Full Throttle has very easy puzzles compared to the other games in this genre, didn't take me a lot of time to figure them out and finish the game."

I played Full Throttle religiously when it was first released in '95, so when I heard it was getting the remaster treatment, naturally I snapped it up in a heartbeat.Damn is it a nostaligia trip. It's quite short, clocking in at just over a couple hours, but in saying that I knew how to solve all the game's puzzles.That didn't matter though, I had an absolute blast playing through Full Throttle once again.Great characters, great style, fantastic soundtrack.

,Recommended,228360,31326668,Posted: 23 April,all,The Horror Network | Embalmer,"Full Throttle is a point and click adventure title that was originally released in 1995 by LucasArts, a company better known for their Indiana Jones, Sam & Max, and Monkey Island series'. Don't feel bad if you've never heard of this game, as it's one of the more obscure LucasArts titles. Despite the fact that it sold over a million copies, it's still considered a cult classic, one that faded into obscurity until now. Back in the day, two sequels were planned but both ended up being scrapped.Within the world of Full Throttle, the player will take on the role of Ben Throttle, the leader of a bike gang known as The Polecats. The year is 2040, and motorized vehicles are being replaced by anti-gravitational cars instead, meaning that motorcycles in general are about to go extinct. The last domestic manufacturer of these beloved two-wheeled beasts is Corley Motors, and Ben, along with his gang, end up running into the company's CEO, Malcolm Corley. Some things go down, and Ben realizes that the entire company is in jeopardy, which eventually leads to him attempting to solve a murder that he ends up getting pinned for. I can't go into too much detail here, as doing so would spoil a good chunk of the game.The updated graphics are excellent, as always Double Fine have done an outstanding job of sticking to the original game, all the while giving Full Throttle a fresh coat of paint; one can even change between the new and old graphics seamlessly at any time with the press of a button. The voice-overs and soundtrack have also been given a dynamic boost, leading to all of this title's elements feeling brand new. There's also a good chunk of extra content included, such as concept art, developer commentary and the like, some of which is unlocked throughout your playthrough.The soundtrack and voice acting here are phenomenal. Many gamers who are in the age bracket of 25-35 will probably be more prone to recognizing many of the voices from various 90's cartoon shows and movies, such as Kath Soucie from Rugrats, Maurice LaMarche from Pinky and the Brain, and Tress MacNeille from Animaniacs; let's also not forget Mark Hamill who's the voice for Adrian Ripburger, the main antagonist. Needless to say, for its time it was an All Star line-up. As for the music, every song is performed by The Gone Jackals, and while the game doesn't feature any ""hits"", it's still a decent rock n' roll soundtrack.Unfortunately, that's pretty much where the good side of Full Throttle ends, the remainder is just a pile of mediocre mush that ended up getting this revival thanks to the cult following that the game amassed. Do you like motorcycles? Explosions? Heavy Metal? A generic biker protagonist? Then this game still probably isn't for you. The plot is underwhelming, and the puzzles are some of the easiest in any point and click adventure game, which is odd for a title by LucasArts. The latter point leads to this game being very short, you will be hard pressed to squeeze out more than 3-4 hours of playtime, so it's up to you to decide if $16.99 CAD is worth the few hours of entertainment you'll get.Rating:3.0/5.0- Average, can take it or leave it.The Horror NetworkCurator|GroupClick for Gore"

,Recommended,228360,33997167,Posted: 3 August,all,dirk.dierickx,"Much like when the remastered ‘Day of the Tentacle’ came out, I bought the game and played it to completion in a few days. Sometimes remembering the puzzle, sometimes not, sometimes I even forgot whole parts of the game. These were the games I played and loved the most. Adventure games were big once, and this one, being made by Lucasarts was one of the best. Because that is what Lucasarts did, they made the best adventure games. They knew everything that was wrong with all the others and improved it with great stories, crazy situations and hilarious jokes. Full Throttle is most of these, but also breaks some of these rules.It has horrible action sequences (which luckily you can keep trying without really dying), timed events and trail-and-error sections. You won’t find any of these in MI or DotT (they were present in the Indiana Jones adventures, though) which is why those games rate higher for me then FT does.It’s also very short and the puzzles are easier and more logical, so normally you should be able to figure out things fairly quick, locations are also limited so you don’t spend too much time walking around a huge map trying to figure out what you missed before. It probable was, in it’s day, the most accessible adventure game for most people.After more then 20 years the game is still great, if you like adventure games and haven’t played this one before, you should. If you played it when the original was released you should also play it.Why? Because it’s gives you the same feeling as watching that great movie you haven’t seen for a long time and wonder why they don’t make them like they used to anymore. Even though, with upgraded graphics and all, it doesn’t feel modern and aged a bit.The remastered graphics are great, I love that they just upgraded the original art, just as they did with DotT. The remastering of MI was a let-down for me, as it was too different from the original artwork. That is not the case here, it’s just as you remember. It’s also around this time that pre-rendered gfx was started to being used in Lucasarts adventures and, well, they don’t really age well, even in remastered form I prefer the hand drawn pixelwork any day.One thing I find funny now, is that Tim Shafer kinda looks like Ben Throttle. I also saw the making-off video on youtube and he didn’t really look like that in the 90’s.The game runs very well and smooth on Linux/SteamOS, it did crash on me once after multiple hours of play. I could start it up right away again, and the auto-safe system made me lose none of my progress. It works well with the Steam Controller, however using them feels weird as these games were originally made for keyboard+mouse controls. Streaming to a Steam Link is no problem either."

I love that it lets you instantly transition from the original audio/visuals to the remastered audio/visuals in real time, so you can see the difference in every scene. This game is a must play and the remaster really does an excellent job of enhancing the experience.My only complaint is that some scenery had animations/effects that were removed in the remaster eg. lights flickering gently in the clouds or the water dripping in the Cavefish hideout. Not gamebreaking and I wouldn't have even noticed if it weren't for being able to switch between original/remaster with the push of a button but I was suprised with so much love and attention given to the game they missed these."

,Recommended,228360,31224119,Posted: 18 April,all,deeplogic,"I've been looking forward to this since I found out about it, although I was really just happy that I could buy Full Throttle again.I can't say I've been ""enjoying"" the new artwork. I was already a fan of the game, remember how wonderful it was when released and have no problem playing it in that format. I've been toggling between the new artwork and the old, but, as is almost always the case with these remastered editions, I was toggling just to see what they had done. Now that I have, when I sit back down with this later, I'll be sticking to classic. While Double Fine does a great job, I still find myself wanting to see the artwork in its original style, not a reinterpretation and extrapolation.What I have been really enjoying is the commentary. It's great to hear the team that created this discuss it in-length. Considering I've loved this title for, gosh, 22 years now, that was exactly the type of material around it I wanted. I also appreciate that the soundtrack is available in-game.So, if you liked Full Throttle, buy this, hands-down. If you never played it, I can't say my review is for you, but I'd recommend it anyway if you have even the slightest inclintation to buy it. It's a great point-and-click adventure from Lucas Arts."

Now the remastered edition brings a very much needed HQ audio overhaul, and new HQ visuals.The original graphics is an animated pixel art wonder, the updated is much more cartoon styled, and brings backgrounds, characters, and vehicles to a coherent, stylized look. Both have their charm, and that's where this remaster shines. It helps you play the original art, (with upgraded audio, as the old audio did not aged well) and also let's you enjoy the new graphical take on the game, which turned out way better than I expected.Gamepad support helps to play the game from the couch, and commentary, concept art and a jukebox will help you learn about the game's development, and appreciate the soundtrack.One of the most unique adventure games got the HQ treatment it needed, while staying faithful to it's roots.

76561198055631052,Recommended,228360,31367405,Posted: 25 April,all,Rafalo15,"Set in a somewhat dystopian future in the year 2040, Full Throttle takes place in a world where hover-vehicles are slowly erasing their old fashioned, motorised counterparts from existence, and the few people to cling to the old ways are Ben Throttle and his gang, the Polecats.Framed for the murder of Malcolm Corley, the CEO of Corley Motors, the last company to build motorized vehicles, Ben works to unveil the truth of the murder and clear his and his gang's name. After finding Maureen, the estranged daughter of Malcolm, he sets out to help her claim her rightful place.For a game that is now 22 years old, Full Throttle's original graphics still look amazing and the original audio holds up, albeit a bit fuzzy. I opted to go for the remastered graphics and audio for the true remastered experience, despite this being my first play ever.To be honest I just wanted to make full use of my monitor and not deal with those pesky black bars.You can tell a lot of work was put into this overhaul, as switching seamlessly between rendering modes will show how much has changed, the colours are crisper and cleaner, there's more to the backgrounds too and the characters just look better overall.There's no wall of text when it comes to choices like the stellar Day of the Tentacle or Secret of Monkey Island which gave you a multitude of ways to interact with people. In Full Throttle however, you play a biker so of course you think like a biker and so you either punch, kick, or talk to people or use objects in that manner.While its neat that they simplified the UI in this, it also feels extremely simplified compared to previous LucasArts games.Full Throttle has some truly stellar voice actors, I mean they had Mark Hammil voice the damn villain and he is superb as ever, he just emanates pure evilness as Ripburger. Roy Conrad's deep, gravelly voice suits Ben so perfectly that its a shame he didn't do much voice work after this. Kath Soucie voices Maureen and she's great, as a child I adored her as Phil and Lil from Rugrats. Can't forget her as Lola Bunny in Space Jam too but uh... thats a different thing altogether.There was this one section in Mine Road where you have to acquire an item to get another one which in turn opens up the area you need to access. The worst part is that the enemies randomly spawn, so you have to either keep knocking out enemies or skipping the fights to get what you needed. This took way longer than it should have, and considering that the combat is also clunky as hell with the mouse controls, I failed a bunch before I finally succeeded, this was one area I was definitely glad to be done with.Even playing for the first time, I didn't struggle with the puzzles, for the most part they had incredibly easy solutions or required some precise mouse positioning. They could be annoying but at least they weren't overcomplicated or required absurd solutions.Overall the game took less than 5 hours for me to complete, even with me taking my time and exploring, but despite the short playtime I really enjoyed this game and it reminded me of how great LucasArts was during the 90's.The characters are interesting but with the short playtime, their storylines feel rushedGreat musicHumour is on pointExtras such as concept art and commentaryOh there was one small thing that bugged me, which is that you can only see the end credits in the original version and not the remastered. Not sure why but, there ya go."

Some things look strange (like the rocks passing by in reverse when your driving down the road due to animation framerates), but overall it's a respectable improvement over the original.  I paid over $10 for this game, but I feel that the price was fair given the amount of playtime (some people might want to wait until it's under $7).  If you have already played the game then you could probably fly through it in a couple hours, but some puzzles will give newcomers a total playtime of 6 hours or more.  It's not a long game, but I enjoyed it; good job on the additions, Double Fine."

Not to say that some of the puzzles aren't intersting, but there's no real ""failed"" state.  There's no real need to save scum, if you screw up bad enough the game lets you reset.  It's a casual game for casual point & click gamers.  The focus is clearly on the story, so don't expect too much in the way of game play challenges, just enough to keep it fun and sometimes frustrating, but the frustrating parts don't drag on forever."

That game was perfect then (in 1995) and hell, it's still perfect now.ProIt's the same old gameThe graphics are really goodsounds and voices are really well remasteredWidescreen at last!MUSICS!Probably one of the best story ever!consShort (but i'll go futher into that laters)no credits at the end in the remastered versionGraphic looks cool yes, but sometime they looks a bit too blurySounds and voices are well remastered, but it seems a rerecording would have been a bit better. But since the principal character of the game's voice actor died, I totally anderstand the choice.About the short game play. It's kinda understandable since the was short on release.... I mean it's the same game! And in 1995 it was one of the first games with animation, musics and voice and it all stand on a single CD. CD costed a lot more to produce back then, then today. So they had to make the story short of course. Fortunatly this remastered version offer you a commentary tracks (that i will certainly play) that will compensate for those that want more then just play the game.Bonus also inlcude a complete BGM of the game as well as original comcept arts.Now for the weirdest cons of all... In the remastered version at the end of the game there is no credits. I mean the music play and all... but no text, no animations... no nothings. Except for the LucasArt logo at the Real end of it. But if you switch to the ogrginal look of the game, you can see the credits. I found that weird, and also a bit irespectfull for those who worked on the game. I mean if you don't want the old programer to show up on the rematsered version i woud anderstand... but at least put your poeples out there.

76561198046434571,Recommended,228360,31251640,Posted: 20 April,all,Purple Tentacle,"Full Throttle has finally gotten the same treatment that Day of the Tentacle got in its remastered version. When releasing old classics on modern platforms such as Steam, there's the issue of whether to stay true to the original or to improve on the graphics & sound to provide a fresh experience that is more palatable to modern expectations. Fortunately, Tim Schafer & Co. have found the compromise in being able to seamlessly switch back & forth between the original version & the modern reinterpretation. The graphics line up perfectly with the original, and yet are of a much higher quality. Even the soundtrack & voicelines are a higher definition, since the original was released on CD-ROM, which didn't have enough space to handle the high def versions.As to the game itself, the plot flows incredibly well with the puzzles. It seamlessly tells the story as you progress through the game, giving it a rather cinematic feeling. All the atmosphere & characters are incredibly well-written. There are a few downsides that should be noted: The most common complaint is that the game is a bit short, which is true. The upside of that is that the game never drags. The other negative is that there are a few arcade sequences (one of which can be skipped), and while I don't mind arcade sequences, they're almost never well written in adventure games. The bike fights are certainly playable, and even enjoyable on some level, but the novelty wears off quickly.Obviously, it's hard to talk about the quality of the puzzles in an adventure game without spoilers. So I will sum it up by saying that I find the puzzles to be well written, never so difficult that you get stuck, but also not so obvious that there's no challenge. Overall, I highly recommend Full Throttle as an adventure game, and the effort put into the remastered version really gives the game the tribute that it deserves.Oh, and the soundtrack blows me away. The Gone Jackals CD is worth getting if you can find it."

The nostalgia factor with this game is very strong, and may be the only real reason to play it. The puzzles range from decently thought out to impossibly obscure and the combat mechanic is boring. The story is good, the voice acting is great, and it's really fun to enjoy the game again after all these years.Final verdict for me: If you already really enjoy old Point n Click adventure games, this is an excellent addition to your collection. If you haven't played any/many, this is a really really bad place to start."

Being able to relive my old memories from the game and to be able to change between old and remastered graphics as well as sound was amazing. For its current price it may seem a little pricey for such an old game, but considering the remastered graphics sound and music, it is worth paying the full price to relive the old memories of it (if you have played the original game) or if you would just like to play a classic that is well remastered, go ahead and buy it.Pros:-Able to switch between original pixelated and newly remastered graphics as well as sound with the click of a button-Great story-Easy to use controls-Newly added main menu, allows you to save, load saves, has a bonus menu and more-Selective dialogues-Skippable cutscenes-Skippable Dialogue-You are able to interact with certain objects in the game and as you progress further, you will need to find certain objects along the way.-Able to interact with other characters, this being talking to or fighting other bikers on the road with your fists, feet, or weapons that you find along the wayCons:-Short game, can be finished in under 3 hours (The original game was released in 1995 which is understandable)-Can seem 'too easy', requiring simple thinking to continue further through the storyTL:DROverall I would rate this game 9/10. The game may be short but it is worth replaying to get 100% completion. The game allows for overall great interaction with the other characters, being fighting other bikers, using objects scattered around the world to progress further into the game and the dialogue with other characters. Easy at times, certain parts will leave you thinking or send you off to Google to find out how to pass it. Other than that, I cannot find more fault in the game, it remains my favourite game from my childhood."

Voice acting is superb and holds up really well all these years later.

Other reviews are used to help stress my point across but are changed in such a way to make the review in my own wordingFull Throttle is a game originally developed and published by the gods of adventure games; LucasArts and has been faithfully remastered by Double Fine Productions, the same people who did Grim Fandango Remastered and Day of the Tentacle RemasteredFull Throttle's story is brilliant. From its quirky characters to its lovable cutscenes and quirky comedy. The music (especially in the remastered edition) is absolutely brilliant! The cutscenes are lovable and fun to watch, overall the game is brilliant!The puzzles and game progression, although when I was young and I played Full Throttle for the very first time I did not have any walkthroughs or guides, hell I didn't even have internet back in 2003 (just after playing Grim Fandango for the first time), so the puzzles were a bit challenging and can be a bit too awkward for modern-day players or even newcomers to the genre. The game does not help you at all when progressing through and does not hold your hand when your stuck on a puzzle for too long, so be prepared to get stuck here and there, thankfully I remembered most of the stuff! Lucky guys with internet nowadays, you can simply type in walkthroughs for the game!The remastered version, Double Fine have really done a job well done for remastering this classic. The music is spot-on and digitally remastered. The cutscenes, although not fully converted to HD are very watchable, and the new HUD system they implemented has made it easier for players to play the game (honestly, the game's original controls were clunky and very awkward, surprisingly you can still play with the old controls!). The addition of HD graphics and shadow textures, etc... made the game more stunning than it originally was (and if you want some nostalgia, you can play the game in its original graphics!)The thing that put me off slightly was the aspect ratio, this game is not tailored for 16:9 monitors and it seems that Double Fine did not optimize the game for 16:9 monitors but kept it at 4:3 aspect ratio, you can still change the aspect ratio from its original 4:3 to 16:9, but you might have to play the game stretched out.Overall, Full Throttle and its remastered version are simply brilliant and if you are a fan of LucasArts (like me!) or you like adventure games or you want to try something new, then I would highly recommend playing Full Throttle and I hope that Double Fine will continue to remaster these old LucasArts classics!RECOMMENDED :)"

A true classic, that has been revitalized to stay fresh and easily playable on modern machines.The remaster's animations could have touched some things up some more with nicer animations and some more detailed cartoony details for the deserts and landscapes especially. Otherwise this is the same as Day of the Tentacle, Grim Fandango, and the Monkey Island Remakes. It stays mostly true to the original with the ability to tap in and out of classic and remastered mode with the press of a key. They remastered the audio as well, and made a nifty menu, added some bonus like concept art and extended/redrawn art so it fit in modern resolution of monitors, and tim schaeffer talking about stuff in a director's voice over thing.

I I remember playing around in the car scene not finishing on purpose just to drive a little more.I was 10 years old at that time and I am going to do the same again now!10/10. Perfect fun and quite genious puzzles (at least that is what I remember)!

I had a couple gripes:They forgot to paint a nut in one of the puzzles, so if you havn't played the game before you may be really confused if you're in ""remastered mode"" and not ""regular mode"" where the nut is still painted in.Some of the commentary can't be watched because it appears in a part of the game that is timed so you can't hear all of it without losing.The commentary seems like a lot of it was cut, which is appropiate for how much was originally cut from this game.The credits don't appear in the remaster, if you want to see the credits you have to switch to original. I don't know if this was intentional or an oversight.All-in-all, they did a beautiful job of re-painting the cells, the sound has been touched up, and just like the DOTT remaster you can switch between the original and remastered on the fly, which makes it that much better. Worth every penny in my opinion!"

If you're not into that sort of thing then stay faaaaar away from this game. It does very well at being what it is but what it is can be frustrating. Three of the things you need to do in this game had no real logic behind them and some weren't really puzzles, just hidden access areas that are hard to see because of the control layout. These made me have to look up a guide which completely f**ks up the game for me because it takes away any sense of accomplishment one gets from finishing the game. Also, it's worth mentioning that the ending sucks, probably because Lucas Arts was expecting to make a sequal to the game, which never happened and now almost definitely never will. This sucks because adventure games, in my view, are 70% about the story and 30% about the gameplay so if the story fails then it's a big loss."

,Recommended,228360,31407712,Posted: 27 April,all,-NN-,"This is the poorest made of the remakes/remasters that I've played in the genre. The graphical update is often underwhelming and, in a sense, too faithful to the original and all its artistic flaws. There are also a couple of bizarre graphical glitches as well as a lack of detail in the remaster, which caused me to play most of the game in its original incarnation -- you can choose between original and remastered graphics and audio as you play these remastered adventure games.Aside from how lacklustre the remaster is on a technical level, the game itself is very interesting in many ways, with an intriguing plot of deceit and murder over big business and future ambition of the Corley Motors company and its owning partners, who share (or do they?) a passion for legacy motorbikes. Unfortunately, the game suffers from readability issues and isn't terribly intuitive in allowing you to really get a feel of what exists on the screen, which can lead to some frustrating misses of objects that need to be interacted with. It also feels a tad bit on the short side and overall it's marred with a lot of small problems which do detract from the overall experience of what is still a good game. All in all, the game lacks the cogency of most other LucasArts adventures."

I never found a bug on a Double Fine game and on this one I had to load old save files several times to be able to progress in the game.Some times objects were missing, other times the animations were laggy, I even ended up driving backwards at some point.Don't get me wrong, I really wanted to love this game but I had to ask for a refund and I'll play the old version instead."

,Not Recommended,228360,31300867,Posted: 22 April,all,Stranno,"Mi opinión va al respecto de la remasterización, no del juego en si. Full Throttle me lo pasé en su día y me lo he pasado varias veces a lo largo de los años. Me parece una buena aventura de LucasArts, lo cual ya lo situaría entre las mejores aventuras de la historia, pero ni de lejos me parece una de sus mejores aventuras. Es un juego simple, el resideño del SCUMM fue muy mejorable, es muy corto y la sección de la autopista, una buena parte del juego, sobra bastante.La remasterización, sin embargo, es la típica holgazanería de Tim Schafer cuyos últimos años parecen más enfocados a su canal de Youtube que a hacer juegos con una calidad acorde a su importancia en la industria.Ciertos gráficos han sido creados desde cero con un buen grado de detalle y gran calidad artística, como los personajes y algunos objetos, pero a los fondos sencillamente se les ha añadido un filtrado horrible (estilo xBRZ), lo cual hace que vayan desde lo aceptable hasta lo más chabacano que te puedas imaginar. Hay fondos concretos, como la choza del tío Pete o la guarida del avión Jumbo, que son una desgracia visual. Al menos crearon nuevo contenido para rellenar hasta los 16:9 y no hicieron el recorte de pantalla de Grim Fandango, algo es algo..Pero su mayor problema es que el juego no tiene un solo frame de animación nuevo con lo que sigue yendo a los clásicos 10-15 frames de animación por segundo, exceptuando algunas animaciones de la autopista, lo que con los nuevos gráficos hace que quede aún más tosco de lo que quedaba en su día.Obviamente todo esto es al respecto de los nuevos gráficos. Siempre se puede elegir el pixel-art original a 4:3 y disfrutar de los gráficos originales. En cuyo caso, en mi opinión, sigue no recomendando el juego porque no ofrece absolutamente nada sobre ScummVM + el juego original que algunos ya tenemos.12€ por una ejecución nativa en Windows 10 me parece demasiado dinero y por eso no recomiendo esta obra como remasterización. Como juego desde luego sí lo recomiendo, aunque recomendaría antes algunos otros juegos de LucasArts.En Steam no me lo he pasado porque tardó un par de días más en aparecer respecto a GOG, quién sabe porqué. A lo que habría que sumar las 5-10 veces que me lo he pasado en su versión original antes que esta remasterización.Si ponéis Full Throttle Remake en Google Imágenes, la primera de ellas es un impresionante artwork creado por un tal luisimage hace siglos. Eso, concretamente, es lo que hubiera esperado de una remasterización actualizada."

76561198043910845,Recommended,228360,31244351,Posted: 19 April,all,Last_Sinner,"Played this back in the mid 90s. It took me a while to get Full Throttle compared to the other LucasArts games I've played but I got what it was able to do. Point and click games could be rough and gritty. They didn't always need to be slapstick and light. A tale closer to reality can be woven in that genre.Full Throttle comes across somewhat differently to most of the LucasArts catalogue. It isn't as complex in figuring out certain puzzles like Monkey Island or Day of the Tentacle was. It's not as story-rich as The Dig or as detailed as Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis. But what it does have is attitude, a protagonist unlike those of other LucasArts titles in a very good way, a belting soundtrack by The Gone Jackals and mixes in some of the usual zany LucasArts humour with a gritty tale and setting.Ben is a badass. The context to give a damn about him is established quickly. Maureen is capable of handling herself overall and has her own axe to grind. It's their tale to tell. If the rest of the cast don't seem detailed/utilised enough, it's because of the lone wolf mentality that encapsulates Ben. Just keep on riding, punch whatever's in the way and do whatever it takes to survive. Ben is more than capable of carrying this tale and Maureen adds some depth to it when required.Brief summation on the various ramblings I've seen about whether the remaster was worth it. Overall, yes. Some moments/cutscenes had very awkward looking facial expressions/character designs in the original. They're very clear here and don't lose the style of the original. There was the odd moment the game froze and the odd moment in a couple of cut scenes did drop in frame rate.

Plays just like the classic.  Remastered graphics are excellent.  Quite similar in style to the remastered Monkey Island games.You shouldn't be disappointed with the product.  Go ahead and buy it and enjoy your classic game given new life.

In 96' I had the game for a Mac I would play to the end just to recreate the save file for the ending because I reformated the mac often due to brother and sister messing with system files. more to the point the ending had 3 of the Gone Jackals sound track so I can record another mix tape on cassette.I still to this day listen to this sound track on my phone at work. So when time came I saw a remaster was on preorder on steam I said I need to support this game again so in the future they make that long lost sequel."

For me, It was full throttle.I'm glad I was able to play this again remastered. People don't realize this, but the reason why this game is so short is, 1): LucasArts had to cut so much stuff from development and 2): Fundamentally, the character in this adventure game was short and to the point, and it was reflected on some of the simple puzzles. It was more of a practical game, you needed a hose and gas can to siphon off gas, and use your lips on the hose to kickstart it.In essence, this game was and is the complete opposite of Ron Gilbert's Secret of Monkey Island. Instead of combining seemingly wacky but useless items into something actually useful, or resolving situations in a creatively non-violent way, Full Throttle tackles most problems head on, with few puzzles requiring something you wouldn't have brute-force your way out of.Like i said, this line of thought kind of goes off the rails in the later parts of the game, but even with the nostalgia baggage, I consider this game to be one of the shortest but sweetest point and click adventure games out there.One problem I'd like to make note of, and help highlight it so that other players will be more cautious...The biker fighting section. When you are riding and fighting other bikers, you cannot save your game, and I have had my game crash at least once when losing a fight, losing all of my progress. I recommend that you take an exit out of the mine road, and ride to a place you can save before heading out again, especially if you made good progress without saving.Other than that, I highly recommend this game to newcomers and players who have played it alike. If you finished the game before, i reccomend starting the game with developer commentary, and anybody new to it, just play the game the way it was intended to be."

,Recommended,228360,31359921,Posted: 25 April,all,BRFan94,"Having played almost all of Tim Schafer's games, I can safely say that Full Throttle is the weakest and shortest of his games that I've played. I played the game once, years ago, and with only a vague remembrance of certain puzzle's solutions from that playthrough, I was able to beat the game this time in under four hours.I feel that in comparison to other Schafer games I've played, Full Throttle still remains the weakest in various fields, such as puzzles, length, humour, characters, and story.It may seem strange then that I'm recommending the game, but it's simple: Even Schafer's weakest work is still great.For the €15 asking price, you are getting great material here. Double Fine don't half♥♥♥♥♥their remasters. A lot of blood, sweat and tears go in to these remasters, beyond just making the game look nicer. There are some great bonus features that we've come to expect from these remasters. You are getting value for your money, even if you've played the game before.The game, as it originally came out, tried some new features, and they pretty much fail. Anything outside of the pre-established point-and-click gameplay just doesn't work. This includes the game's infamous motorcycle fight sections (which really aren't that big a staple of the game) and the motor derby section. These are still included, and it may suck some fun out of the experience, but they are presented as they originally were, and, what's the point of claiming to play a game if you're not going to play it, warts and all? I seem to remember a cheat code in the original version that just won the motorcycle fights automatically. I can't comment on whether or not they're in this version. I couldn't remember the code off hand, and I didn't bother looking it up to test it.I was hesitant with other remasters from Double Fine after buying Grim Fandango Remastered, only for the game to crash constitanty. The only solution, at least at the time, was to put the settings from remastered to original. It worked, but it kind of sucked that I couldn't experience the remaster of the game. Then I played Day of the Tentacle Remastered and it ran beautifully. So I had no concerns with Full Throttle Remastered, only for the game to crash on the first cutscene. Thankfully, this was the only bug I encountered in the game.I think for seasoned vets of point-and-click adventure games, Full Throttle may be too simple for you. Actually, I think there's a tendency of seasoned vets of point-and-click adventure games to overcompensate for the often convoluted steps required to solve a puzzle, therefore the almost laughably simple solutions to puzzles in this game may prove a challenge after all!I feel with its short length and simple puzzles, Full Throttle may be a good intermediary for people who haven't played point-and-click adventure games before. (If I recall correctly, that was the intent of the game when it was originally in development in the early '90s, to bring new people to the adventure game genre. Adventure games were a niche market, and had a hard time breaking beyond the 200,000 or so sales, and it worked, as Full Throttle sold over 1,000,000 copies.)Oh, and the artwork and soundtrack were then, and are now, awesome!"

After playing through the remaster, I really have to commend Doublefine for doing such a good job on updating the look of the game...switching back and forth between remastered and classic, the attention to detail is amazing.As for cons, the only things I can think of is there are the odd bugs here and there (eg. audio slightly off by a millisecond when changing scenes sometimes, credits didn't display for some reason, etc), some of the puzzles do show their age, and the game is rather short at around 3 hours (if you remember the puzzles)...but that said, if you enjoyed this game back in 1995, then buying the remaster is a no-brainer.

If you like adventure games, this one is essential playing. The remaster itself is so well done that it's apparent a lot of TLC went into its making. Switching between the original and remastered artwork is seamless and additional interface features have been added. Among those is a highlight feature that illuminates interactable objects and environment elements. Another is gamepad integration that works fairly well if you want to kick back and play on the living room TV. The audio is crisp and punchier than the original due to original tape access by the dev team. Everything has been redrawn and animated and everything is done with surgical care.

Full Throttle has updated art and sprites and they look gorgeous to look at when you switch it to the original art for the game which still looks good. The remaster makes the game look even better. The combination of 3-D and 2-D in the remaster looks so damn awesome to look at too. The music is really badass which is one of my favorite things about the game. Every rock beat was just porn for my ears.The story for the most part is a pretty simple plot but not bad either. You and your gang have been framed for murder and you're trying to put a stop to the murderer's plan of taking over his murdered victim's company. Not as engaging as Fandango, but still a pretty good story with a few cliches. The game is pretty short, I had this game for like a day. I started yesterday and I finished just today. Despite that, I still had a good time.The controls for the motorcycle combat sections are infuratating and very short lived. You can use either your mouse or arrow keys to move your bike. Using your mouse for the combat sections are the worst. Don't get me started on the demolation durby section on the final act of the game. The controls are very frustrating and you're better off using the arrow keys. Because the mouse is also used to control your bike it makes the combat sections a little annoying but you can skip them. Most of the time I was just spamming my fist to take down a biker to acquire some of there weapons. Aside from the chainsaw lady and the Cavefish biker which I had to use a different weapon. These sections in my opinion require minimal effort honestly and they're not hard to do.The puzzles in the game aren't half bad to solve thanks to the SHIFT key. Which allows you to highlight the areas that are interactive. I solved a few and did got a little stuck on some of them. Resulting in guide consulting. One of my favorite puzzles is were you're trying to go into a biker's hideout and it's suddenly rigged with explosive mines. To solve this you have to use these wind up toy bunnies to blow the mines up and it's just hilarious. Probably, one of my favorite moments in the game. Another moment I like is constantly alarming the cops while refilling oil for my bike which engages in some pretty funny dialogue.This game is definitely worthy of a check out. It's a badass game albeit very short with some really good production value and a lot of heart too it."

The graphics are good on high resolution monitors, so thats not an issue.  The gameplay is the same, as far as I can tell.  It is a fun game for everyone to play.  There are a few puzzles that will be frustrating for the new player.  Some items you interact with are not easily noticed.  Sure you can shift to highlight, but it highlights an entire area, witout showing you a specific spot.  This can cause some frustration, if you dont know what to do.  Also, there are a couple puzzles that just arent obvious as to what to do.  There are no clues and the action is counterituitive to what you think you are trying to accomplish.  Fortunately, there are guides on the internet.  Other than that, it is a fun game, albeit short."

I loved this game when I was in my teens and was super happy they did a remake for it. My friend Alan had never played it, so I convinced him to play it with me.https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6YFuXLwvxnj5AjgRnILxBrpvvjG8n3yQ"

I played it through with mostly the old graphics the first run and I'm planning to play another round with the next graphics. If you liked the old game, you're gonna like this one."

76561197965046644,Recommended,228360,35108219,Posted: 21 September,all,DarkSnakeSoul,A classic brought back to life. So happy they remastered Full Throttle and awesome that they added the feature to switch back and forth to see the old classic to the remastered. Overall the story and gameplay are still fun and enjoyable as I remembered. If you haven't played Full Throttle then I suggest picking this up as it's a very fun point and Click adventure.
,Recommended,228360,35195505,Posted: 24 September,all,P.F.,"A gorgeous remaster of a classic mid-90's point-and-click adventure game that never got mainstream attention like LSL or Monkey Island for some reason. You play as Ben, a badass biker who gets unwittingly embroiled in a scheme involving a corporate takeover and murder, and his job is to solve puzzles and kick butt until he unravels the mystery and clears his name.The game is virtually unchanged from the original aside from hi-definition redrawings of the graphics and remastered audio for the music/voices, although you still have the option of using the ""low definition mode"" if you want to relive the experience of playing Full Throttle on an old Windows 98 computer.The fact that Full Throttle Remastered is essentially unchanged from the original works against it in a few ways however, the main issue being the story is too short (it can be beaten in a few hours for a first time player) and the combat/driving is still very clunky. Thankfully the rest of the experience is highly polished and enjoyable, and the puzzles are quite forgiving compared to other games in the genre. This makes it a good first adventure game for those who are not ready for the trickier titles.Also included is some developer commentary and concept art which can be unlocked by simply playing the game, which is always a nice bonus for the die-hard fans.I hope the positive reception this game gets can spur the developers into finally making a proper sequel to Full Throttle, as I and many other fans would love to see Ben's story continue!"

I was about 6 when this came out, but had gotten it free because a family member got a new pc at the time. Suffice to say, it's one of the best adventure games I played in the 90s.Full Throttle is a story about a leader of a bike gang who is just trying to make some money to sustain him and his gang. By fate, they sort of run into an opportunity for better or worse, and thus starts Ben's adventure which ultimately leads to him being framed and trying to prove his innocence for much of the game.This game is the classic point-and-click style. A lot of trial and error is involved if you aren't using a guide. Compared to a lot of similar styled games though, I always found this one to be the most refreshing, humorous, and overall rewarding for my curiousity. So much of the dialogue is great to me. I don't know how many times I laughed out loud at Ben's cynical, sarcastic remarks on the most random items.The remaster is done well, but I'll admit for me, I love seeing it in it's original mode. Luckily, you can play either or! I gotta give a shout-out to the band The Gone Jackals for the music on here too. I love it; it fits so well, and honestly gives this game another layer of personality. The art direction in general is very memorable as well. Those night shots with the purple starry sky just will never leave me...As far as being a Lucasarts title, we know the standard set. If you enjoy these games, I whole-heartedly recommend. Especially if you're a rocker at heart. ;)"
